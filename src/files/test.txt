    Tim Ferriss:
   This is Episode 1 of the Tim Ferriss podcast. For those of you who donÕt have 
any context on me, IÕm the author of 
The 4
-Hour Workweek
, The 4
-Hour Body,
 and 
The 4
-Hour Chef
, which 
have been translated into more than 35 languages, 
and all three books are comprised of self
-experiments.
  I travel the world and find people who are world
-class in different skills, and 
then I try to dissect that skill and test it on myself. That can range
 from 
performance
-enhancing drugs,
 to hacking the NFL combine, to outsourcing my 
life to India, to cramming two years of culinary school into 48 hours, or trying 
to learn a
 foreign language in a few days
 well enough to go on live television 
and be intervie
wed.
 ItÕs in search of a toolkit. You do not have to be super
-human to get super
-human results. 
  To that end, this podcast is going to be a lot like Inside the ActorÕs Studio, but 
not limited to actors. We will have in
-depth conversational interviews with
 actors, investors, hackers, professional athletes, black market chemists, and 
everybody in
-between. It will be very wide
-ranging, but covering it all is really 
the 80/20 analysis.
  In the process of speaking with these people weÕll try to suss out what ar
e the 
critical few things versus the trivial many. What are the 20% of tactics, 
philosophies, or principles that they use to get 80% of the results theyÕve had? 
There should be a lot of actionable bits hidden in there, or not so hidden in 
the
re, for you to
 use in your life
 or at least to inspire you. It will range from 
tactics to strategies to philosophies to motivations that they use to become the 
best in the world.
  Without further ado, I would like to introduce you through the interview to our 
first gues
t, who is Kevin Rose, a very good friend of mine, a world
-class 
investor and entrepreneur in his own right. His thoughts on investing translate to 
many different areas of life, so I hope you enjoy it, and thank you for listening.
  Tim Ferriss:
   Kevin, wou
ld you mind doing the honors?
  Kevin Rose:
   IÕll do the intro as long as you promise I donÕt have to do this every single time.
  Tim Ferriss:
   You do not. Once itÕs recorded IÕll just use it repeatedly.
