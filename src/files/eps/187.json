This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is always \u2013 or I should say usually \u2013 my job to deconstruct world-class performers, to tease out the habits, routines, tools, favorite practices, workouts, books, whatever it might be, that they use that you can test, that you can experiment with in your own life. This episode is going to be a Round 2, highly anticipated with none other than Jocko Willink. Jocko did his first interview with me, which was the first interview he ever did, and it took the internet by storm. Jocko Willink, @jockowillink on Twitter, jockopodcast.com, is one of the scariest human beings imaginable. A lean 230 pounds, black belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Used to tap out 20 Navy SEALs per workout. He is an intimidating and very intelligent person. I\u2019ve spent more time with him. The more time that I spend with him, the more impressive he is to me. He spent 20 years in the U.S. Navy and commanded SEAL Team 3\u2019s Task Unit Bruiser, the most highly decorated special operations unit from the Iraq War. Upon returning to the U.S., Jocko served as the officer in charge of training for all West Coast SEAL teams, designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic and perhaps psychotic, combat training in the world. His words, not mine. After retiring from the Navy, he co-founded Echelon Front \u2013 I think I\u2019m getting the pronunciation right \u2013 a leadership and management consulting company, and authored the No. 1 New York Times best seller, which was introduced in a way on my podcast, Extreme Ownership, which many of you have read. He now discusses war, leadership, business, Jiu-Jitsu, life, you name it, in his top-rated podcast. He also does some really good book reviews or commentary on things that are dark in some cases, like the My Lai massacre. Jockopodcast. Check it out. Without further ado, we are going to tackle \u2013 or I should say Jocko is going to tackle \u2013 your most common, most burning questions and he doesn\u2019t dodge. So I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Jocko Willink. Jocko Willink: Hey, thanks Tim. Thanks for having me on. I appreciate it. Thanks everybody that submitted questions. I\u2019m going to try and get to as many as I can here. All right, the first one is from a guy by the name of Jeffrey McLeod. The question is: How do you shut internal doubt down and negative chatter out of your head during critical, must-do moments? How do you change emotional negative focus states when something or someone knocks you off focus? First of all, internal doubt is not necessarily a bad thing. I\u2019ve said this before about fear of failure. Because internal doubt \u2013 first of all, that\u2019s a form of humility and obviously humility is a good thing and that internal doubt and that fear of failure is the thing that keeps you up at night preparing. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s not going to let you cut corners. It\u2019s that little voice inside your head that\u2019s whispering, \u201cRehearse again. Practice again. Do it again over and over again.\u201d That\u2019s the voice that says to do everything you can to be ready. So I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m okay with that little internal doubt. But this doesn\u2019t mean that you lack confidence. As a matter of fact, when you prepare correctly, when you have the discipline to prepare correctly, then you will have confidence. That is definitely a good feeling to have because all that negative chatter that you\u2019re talking about here, here\u2019s the deal with that. Every repetition of practice that you do, every iteration of rehearsal that you complete, every bit of study that you do and every drill that you do, all that preparation is going to drown out the negative chatter. So you got to prepare. Now, then we get to this piece here. It was, how do you change emotional negative focus states when something or someone knocks you off focus? Well, I think this is where it\u2019s important to have that ability to detach. And it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re going to completely detach and not feel those things at all. Not like you\u2019re going to make those emotions disappear. It\u2019s not even like you\u2019d want them to disappear completely because those things are normal. But what you have to do when you detach is it\u2019s going to allow you to see those emotions or that negative focus and see it from a distance and then understand that they are there and then make sure that they don\u2019t overwhelm you. And so like in your head, you\u2019re going to be saying oh, okay, I see that. That\u2019s some nervousness sneaking up on me. Got it. That\u2019s a good sign because that means my mind is focused and I\u2019m in the game. Okay. What\u2019s next? Oh, got some negative thoughts? Okay. Well, those are normal. And I\u2019ve got to know that things are going to go bad and that\u2019s fine. How bad can they go? What\u2019s a worst case scenario? Worst case scenario is not that big of a deal. I know I can handle the worst case scenario if it happens, so what else? What else is in my mind? What else negative thought am I having? What about those things that you can\u2019t control? The things that you can\u2019t control and you\u2019re worried about those things. Well, you know what? I can\u2019t control them. So if I can\u2019t control them, why worry about them? Because the energy that you put into worrying about them actually costs you your effectiveness. It\u2019s going to cut into the energy you should be putting towards achieving what you\u2019re trying to achieve. So focus on the things that you can control and make the things that you can\u2019t control 100 percent. The bottom line: with all this with these negative thoughts, if I give everything I can, if I prepare as hard as I can, if I practice as much as I can, if I do have a rehearsal and I do everything I can, and I still come up short? Good. I\u2019m going to learn from it. I\u2019m going to get better. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do with the internal doubt. I\u2019m okay with it. Negative chatter \u2013 I\u2019m going to utilize it and I\u2019m just going to detach a little bit to make sure I don\u2019t get downed out in these emotional situations. So just get your head in the game and get after it. Done. Okay. Next question. Next question comes from Will Gendron. He says: How does his love and study of literature influence his leadership skills? What were some of the best books for developing his knowledge of leadership? Okay. So the thing that I look for when I\u2019m reading.\u00a0When I\u2019m reading, that includes everything. Let\u2019s just talk about everything here: books, history books, literature, even poetry and even song lyrics; everything. I\u2019m trying to learn about human nature. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. And of course, since combat is like life amplified and intensified, which is something we say all the time, a lot of times the books that are about war give some of the best insight into human nature. You\u2019re talking about the stress and the fear and the courage and the breaking points, and the darkness of humanity, and also the beauty of humanity. All those can be seen in their most extreme and their most obvious form in war. So a lot of books that I do read are about war and I have a ton of them. And again, they\u2019re not so much leadership books by definition. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t even know if I have any \u201cleadership\u201d books. But I got a ton of books that have taught me a ton about leadership. First and foremost, and I said this when I was on Tim\u2019s podcast for the first time, About Face by Colonel David Hackworth, it\u2019s the only book I\u2019ve ever actually given anyone. It\u2019s a big book. People that have bought it \u2013 people on Twitter who have gone out and bought that book, it\u2019s a 700-page book. It is a big book. It spans from the tail end of World War II through Korea, Vietnam and a little bit of post-Vietnam. It\u2019s a big book. It\u2019s a career military guy. Colonel Hackworth was just an incredible leader. You don\u2019t just get that from the book. When you learn about Hackworth, if you start digging in and hearing what other people\u2019s opinions are, people loved him, especially the people that worked for him loved him. Now, obviously, he had some trouble up the chain of command at certain points, but that\u2019s part of being a dynamic leader, I guess. He held his ground on some stuff. So that book is just an incredible book. It\u2019s got lessons learned on every page. I cover most of the books that I\u2019ve heard that have had a huge impact on me. I\u2019m covering them on my podcast. So books like With the Old Breed, by Eugene Sledge. Beyond Band of Brothers by Dick Winters. I Remember the Last War by a guy named Bob Hoffman. Another book by Hackworth called Steal My Soldier\u2019s Heart. A book called Platoon Leader by Jim McDonough. Another good Vietnam one, The Killing Zone by Frederick Downs. Those books, you could just go on and on. Again, it\u2019s not always clear that oh, here\u2019s the leadership principle; here\u2019s what you should be doing. No, it\u2019s not always clear like that. But when you understand what people are going through emotionally and you start to get a glimpse at human nature and how people react in certain situations and how their egos flare up, that\u2019s what makes these books good. Because it gives you a frame of reference. I\u2019m still reading all the time. I\u2019m still learning, still trying to get better, still trying to take what other people have been through, how they handled it, what they did right, what they did wrong, mistakes they made. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. I think that\u2019s actually one of the things that has made my podcast become popular because I look at these other people\u2019s experiences and I compare them with mine. It\u2019s just always, I\u2019m always learning. I talk about the mistakes that I made and even the book that I wrote with Leif, it certainly isn\u2019t any kind of a chronically of our triumphs. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite in many cases because much of the book is about mistakes that we made. It\u2019s about things we could\u2019ve done better and lessons that we learned. I think that\u2019s why that book, Extreme Ownership, has done well. It\u2019s something you can learn from and people learn the most, myself included, when you fail. So read and read and read some more. Pay attention to, in my mind, pay attention to the details. Again, not just the leadership, but the human element, the human interaction, the glimpses into the core of human nature. The bigger bank you build of experiencing how humans react, the more you know. Then you take that and you overlay the experiences you read about over what\u2019s happening in your world. I think a key point is to actually think about how what you\u2019re reading applies to what\u2019s happening in your world. Then you start to pay attention to human nature in your world and you see that there\u2019s some underlying force that makes people do what they do. The better you can understand that force of human nature, the better off you\u2019re going to be and the better job you\u2019re going to do as a leader, so keep reading. Next up, I got a guy here named Kip Mackanoonie: What would his advice be to young men and women who are no longer in the military, but are still looking to contribute? Also, has he considered running for any public office position? So if you were in the military and you got out \u2013 either you retired or you just did your time and you got out, go out and put those skills that you got from the military, put those skills to work. The discipline, the work ethic, the leadership, the ability to detach, the ability to instruct. There are industries \u2013 I\u2019m telling you, I work with businesses all the time now and there are industries that need you. In fact, I will tell you that most industries need people like you, people like veterans. And so find an industry that you\u2019re interested in and go get busy. Go get after it. Make that your next mission. If there are no industries that interest you, which is kind of hard to believe that you would have no interest, but if you don\u2019t, or if you\u2019re looking for something that maybe has more internal meaning, then go out and find a really good non-profit organization that needs help. Because again, they need the same thing. They need people, they need leaders, they need people that are disciplined, they need people that can solve problems, they need people with the skills that you have, the skills that you learned in the military. So go and put those to work. I will tell you that America, as a whole, needs leadership. So there\u2019s no reason that veterans, like I said, who have a lot of those skills from being in the military and from being deployed overseas, there\u2019s no reason that veterans shouldn\u2019t make up a big portion of leaders in the civilian sector. So step up and get after it. One last thing about that is there\u2019s a lot of companies \u2013 and again, I work with all kinds of different companies \u2013 all kinds of companies want to hire veterans. They recognize that their success is based on the freedoms that they have, so they want to pay back somehow. So many companies are anxious and eager to hire veterans. So get out there, find what you\u2019re interested in and make it happen. Now, the other part of this question as far as running for political office. I say this all the time; this is kind of a canned answer. I don\u2019t think I have the stomach for it. The corruption and the sliminess of the whole thing. Not to mention just the complete loss of privacy and the scheduling and the whole meeting of people that I don\u2019t like and having to be civil to them. The whole thing. It\u2019s like I said, I don\u2019t think I have the stomach for it. I guess that perhaps at some point that feeling could be overridden. If things got bad enough, I would definitely have a sense of duty and I\u2019m a very patriotic person. If the nation truly needed me, then of course I would serve. But until that time, I\u2019m going to go ahead and just steer clear of any political endeavors. Okay. The next question is from Adrian Marquez. It says: Any considerations regarding being a pawn of the \u2014 and he says \u2014 industrial military conflicts?  And maybe he means \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d? I\u2019m not sure, but we\u2019ll go with it. So again: Any considerations regarding being a pawn of the industrial military conflicts to serve the economic interests of U.S. corporations? Would he do it all over again? The next part of the question is: What\u2019s next? Make up another excuse? Invade an African nation for resources? So, of course, when you are serving in the U.S. military, you are serving. At least, you should be serving the interests of the United States of America, absolutely. And embedded in those interests, there are absolutely the economic interests of American corporations. Obviously, the economic power of the United States is a key component of America\u2019s power and influence in the world. So yeah, when you are a military member, you could be considered a pawn in the military machine. But the fact of the matter is, I am actually honored to have served as a so-called \u201cpawn\u201d in that system. I will tell you this and I\u2019ve said this before, America is far from perfect. We have committed some horrors in our history. Even today, we make mistakes in the world. But when you travel the world and you see how much of the rest of the world lives, how much they live in disarray, and you see the oppression and you see the poverty and you see the corruption and you see the abject violations of basic human rights, then you realize how blessed or lucky or maybe even spoiled we are to live in America. Just to start, let\u2019s just start with potable tap water, drinking water. In America, we just have that here. We have it everywhere. Any home, any apartment, even the prisons. You turn on the tap and you get good, clean, disease-free drinking water. That is not the norm in the rest of the world. On top of that, we have power. Got electricity going into just about every home. That means just about every home has heat in the wintertime and they have air conditioning in the summertime. Let\u2019s just take it a little bit further. What about the access to the internet? The access to the internet here is widespread. There\u2019s something like 70 percent of the adults in America have a smartphone. 70 percent. So 70 percent. So you can gain access to knowledge here unlike any other time in human history. Our healthcare system \u2013 I know it\u2019s not perfect. But I tell you what, if you view our healthcare system from a third-world hospital, which often don\u2019t even have the simplest of medical gear, you\u2019d realize it might not be perfect, but it\u2019s pretty damn good. And then beyond that, let\u2019s look at the food that\u2019s available. Never mind starvation and malnutrition. Our issue in America is actually too much food. Much of the world still has people literally starving to death. America offers an amazing opportunity to build and to create and to be what you want to be and to be who you want to be. Unlike anywhere else in the world, the ability to pursue happiness. Happiness. All those things, all of it, is possible because of the unbridled, individual freedom that America offers. You know what else? It\u2019s also possible because of industry. Because of the incredible corporations and businesses and individuals. Because of people who took advantage of that freedom and worked their asses off to build this nation. So to have been a pawn in that? To have done my small share of work to allow this beacon of light and of hope and of freedom to continue? I\u2019m honored that I had the chance. Would I do it all again? You\u2019re damn right I would. Without question. Then there\u2019s another piece to this question from Mr. Marquez. It says: What\u2019s next? Make up another excuse? Invade an African nation for resources? Well, luckily, we have plenty of resources in our own nation and luckily for the rest of the world, we have used those resources over and over and over again, not to take, but to give. To give freedom to the slaves in our own country, to defeat and destroy the brutal Nazi regime in Germany and free the people of France and much of Europe. We used our resources to defeat Imperial Japan, who was rampaging through Asia, invading and enslaving people with so sign of stopping. We used our resources to try and stop the spread of communism in Asia. Remember that when I\u2019m talking about resources, I\u2019m not just talking about oil and steel and wood. I\u2019m talking about blood. I\u2019m talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of American men and women that gave their lives in the cause of freedom. What resources did we take when we paid with our blood? We took nothing. We took no resources from the Germans. We helped them rebuild into an economic superpower. We took no resources form the Japanese. We helped them rebuild into an economic superpower. The Japanese and the Germans both have some of the highest standards of living in the world. We took nothing from Korea or Vietnam. We took nothing from Afghanistan and even Iraq. We took nothing. We only gave. We continue to give. In 2014, the U.S. government gave $43 billion in foreign aid. Then there was another $23 billion on top of that from America from religious organizations and universities and colleges and private voluntary organizations and even the big American corporations. Now, like I said, that doesn\u2019t mean that America is perfect. Far from it. Far from it. Our past is checkered with horrible mistakes that we\u2019ve made as a nation. We\u2019ve caused massive hardships and incredible suffering. But we also evolved. We have become a benevolent nation, a good nation. I know this because I saw it with my own two eyes. I saw the people of Iraq, who wanted freedom from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, who then wanted protection from the violent terrorist extremists who cheered us in the streets when we killed insurgents and who wept when we left them. Unfortunately, who were murdered when we abandoned them because the politics in our own country. They wanted us in Iraq. The people of Iraq. The normal citizens, they wanted our protection and they wanted our positivity. They wanted freedom, like much of the world does. I was honored to have done my small part to provide the opportunity for freedom around the world and to protect that precious freedom which is all too often taken for granted here at home. Now, the next question. The next question is from someone named Don Ryan. He says: What\u2019s the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever gone through and what do you foresee as the toughest thing on the horizon you\u2019ll endure? Well, the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever gone through is losing my men in combat. I say \u201cmy men,\u201d but they weren\u2019t my men. They were my friends and they were my brothers. Barring the loss of any members of my direct family, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have to endure anything as soul crushing and devastating as losing my friends in combat. Next question. This is from Nathan Lowe: What advice would you give an active duty Navy SEAL or other military personnel following the election if Hillary is elected or if Trump is elected?  Well, the fact of the matter is either Hillary or Trump will be elected. The SEALs, just like the rest of the military, will do what the military always does and what they are sworn to do. If you don\u2019t know what that is, I wrote down here the Oath of Enlistment. I\u2019ll read it to you so you know what it says. It says, \u201cI do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.\u201d So that\u2019s the Oath that you swear to when you join the military. You\u2019re going to obey those orders. Now, there is a little bit of a caveat. That is in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 92. Because it gets a little bit more specific. The Article is entitled, \u201cFailure to Obey Order or Regulation.\u201d \u201cAny person subject to this chapter who (1) violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation; (2) having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by any member of the armed forces, which it is his duty to obey, fails to obey the order; or (3) is derelict in the performance of his duties; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d So the key words there are \u201clawful order.\u201d They made this perfectly clear during the Nuremberg Trials, when the Nazi war criminals claimed that they were just following orders. Well, in America that doesn\u2019t cut it. They have to be lawful orders. So regardless if Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Obama, Bush, Nixon, JFK or Reagan, it doesn\u2019t matter. The military will carry out the lawful orders of the President and that\u2019s that. Next question is from A.J. Nystrom. He says: Jocko, in your book you speak about leadership down and up the chain of command. What, in your opinion and experience, is the most effective way to get leadership up the chain to wake up and break the cycle of rubberstamping ineffective practices, especially in law enforcement? This is a big question. I\u2019ll tell you first things first. The first thing you have to do is be awesome. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do. Seriously. You\u2019ve got to be the best police officer you can be. This goes for any job. You\u2019ve got to build the best possible reputation. That means you\u2019ve got to follow the rules, even the stupid, inconsequential rules. All of them. Become the front runner, the top dog. Now that doesn\u2019t mean you become the loudmouth or the attention grabber, but you become the best, legit police officer you can possibly be. Not only is this going to build your reputation, it\u2019s also going to start to build your relationships up the chain of command. That\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do. You\u2019re trying to build some relationships here. The reason for that is you need to build up the capital, the leadership capital, the respect capital, so that you can ask some legitimate questions. When the time comes, you go and you ask those questions. Actually, I shouldn\u2019t say ask questions, because that gives them a setup to provide you with the answers and you already know the answers and you don\u2019t agree with them. So instead of asking questions, you take the reputation you built as a badass and you raise points. When you raise points, you have solutions. You have solutions that you\u2019ve already socialized with the team which you\u2019ve already maybe even tested or you\u2019ve at least tried. In other words, these are solutions that you know are going to work. Also \u2013 pick your battles. Pick your battles. You\u2019re going to have to eat some stupid stuff. You\u2019re going to do some lame things. But you\u2019ve got to pick your battles. You\u2019re not going to be able to change everything, so you\u2019ve got to pick the most impactful issues to deal with. The other ones? You support those and you follow those like a good soldier, because that gives you more capital when you do raise issues. Here\u2019s the other piece when you raise issues up the chain of command. This is a piece that people mess up all the time. When you raise these points up the chain of command and when you give the solutions, you have to do it from a point of humility. You can\u2019t be looking for the credit. You can\u2019t be looking for the atta-boy. You\u2019ve got to come across and you\u2019ve got to not just come across, you\u2019ve got to actually be the humble person putting forth some suggestions on how to do things better. I\u2019ll tell you the absolute black belt move is when you get them to think that it\u2019s their idea and that they came up with it and that they\u2019ve made up that solution. That\u2019s the ultimate black belt move. That\u2019s what you\u2019re looking to achieve and that is how you win. That is what I did with my career. I worked as hard as I could. I followed everything they told me, but when something stood out, I was able to attack it, address it and get the problem solved or changed because I had built up that capital. So build your reputation, build your relationships, build and vet your idea and your solution, and then present it with humility. Next question is from a guy named Jonathan Mule: How would his lifestyle of extreme discipline translate to someone living a seemingly unrelated life? Artists, writers, etc., who might find more productivity in pockets of leisure or late at night? Now, I would argue that in these creative pursuits, you actually require even more discipline. I would venture to guess that the biggest reason that creative types, people in creative industries, the reason that they don\u2019t produce isn\u2019t because they don\u2019t have vision and it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t have talent. I can just about guarantee that in most cases, it\u2019s a lack of discipline. I\u2019m always saying about working out, the weights in the gym aren\u2019t going to lift themselves; you\u2019ve got to go lift them. Well, it\u2019s the same thing with a book. That book isn\u2019t going to write itself; you\u2019ve got to write it. The painting isn\u2019t going to paint itself; you\u2019ve got to paint it. And if you don\u2019t feel like writing or drawing, or painting, or composing, that doesn\u2019t matter. You do it anyways. You grit down and you force the words onto the paper or you force the brush onto the paper. Or you force the notes out of the instrument. That\u2019s what you have to do. You have to make it happen. You have to force yourself to do it. It\u2019s not always going to be good. You might go back, you might write 1,000 words and you might delete 950 of them, but you got 50 words. 50 words that you didn\u2019t have before. 50 words that you\u2019ve created that are solid. 50 words closer to reaching your goal. Now, as far as the time of day goes, to me it doesn\u2019t matter. If you have some kind of time of day where things seem to flow better or whatever? Great. Take advantage of it. I think people think because I wake up early, which I do, that I believe that everyone must do that. But honestly, it\u2019s not true; it\u2019s the principle. It\u2019s about the principle, not about the specific time. I\u2019ve got to throw a big \u201cbut\u201d on that. Because although you can maybe work at different times or maybe you stay up later or maybe do better work at 2:00 in the morning or 3:00 in the morning and so there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting up at 4:30, that\u2019s okay. But that doesn\u2019t mean oversleep and it doesn\u2019t mean procrastinate and it doesn\u2019t mean hit the snooze button. It doesn\u2019t mean staying up late diving into the depths of useless YouTube videos and claim that is you being creative. Do not lie to yourself. That there\u2019s a decent chance that being creative is actually being lazy in your mind. Do not fall into that trap. I\u2019ll tell you something else. In order to gain skills, in order to master your craft, any craft, you have to practice. You have to practice and practice and practice over and over and over again and again. That requires discipline. That requires discipline and that is another example of how discipline will equal freedom. The more you practice your craft, the better you get at it, the more freedom you have to create. So build the structure and follow it. Put the discipline into your life. The discipline will increase your skills and it will increase your productivity and the discipline will set you free. Now, going onto the next question here. Will the muster event \u2013 oh, sorry. This is from Marco Lopez: Will the muster event be a once-a-year thing only? After working with and training so many different companies, are there any repeating patterns or common weaknesses that business owner need to seem to work on? It also says: \u201cWill you please encourage Jocko to do another Joe Rogan podcast?\u201d So, right on. Joe knows I\u2019m standing by. We\u2019ll make it happen at some point. Great to be on his show. We\u2019re just now getting around to Round 2 with Tim. So maybe Joe is around the corner. We\u2019ll have to wait and see on that one. All right. To get to the question here, for those of you that don\u2019t know, the Extreme Ownership muster is a leadership event that we\u2019re having in San Diego, California. I\u2019m doing it with my business partner, the co-author of the book, Extreme Ownership, Leif Babin, who is a SEAL that I worked with for many years and my brother. We\u2019re holding this thing in San Diego, California on October 20th and 21st. What the event is going to be about is combat leadership. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be about. It\u2019s going to be about combat leadership and we\u2019re going to teach the fundamental principles of combat leadership and how to apply them on the battlefield, in business, and in life. All three. You\u2019re going to see when you come how all three of the applications are the same. These fundamental combat leadership principles \u2013 they don\u2019t change, regardless of whether you\u2019re out hunting down bad guys, or whether you\u2019re hunting for a sale. They don\u2019t change. The response to the event has been awesome. We\u2019ve got a ton of people coming to it, which likely means it looks like we\u2019re going to do another event possibly. We\u2019ve got to carve the time out of the schedule, but it looks like possibly the spring of 2017. Likely going to be somewhere on the East Coast. If it\u2019s going to be somewhere on the East Coast, there\u2019s probably a pretty good chance we\u2019ll be looking at New York City. It\u2019s not set in stone that we\u2019re going to do it; not set in stone when we\u2019re going to do it. We might wait another year. I don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s just up in the air. We have so much stuff on our plates right now that we\u2019ve got to figure out if we can fit it in. But if we do it again, maybe we\u2019ll head out to the East Coast and New York City and get some. The next part of this question is: Are there any repeating patterns or common weaknesses that business owners need to work on? The answer is yes, absolutely there are. We see the same issues from company to company and from leader to leader. The same issues that we see in the civilian sector are the same issues that we saw while we were working with SEAL platoons and training SEAL platoons. The core problems that we see are what we wrote about in the book, Extreme Ownership. That\u2019s one of the reasons we wrote the book was because when we worked with these companies, people would say, \u201cDo you have this stuff written down anywhere?\u201d And eventually we wrote it down. Now what are some of those issues that we run into? I mean, you\u2019ve got departments and divisions that aren\u2019t working together to cover a move. You\u2019ve got communications not being made in a simple, clear, concise manner. You\u2019ve got either too much micro management, which leaves the troops to take no initiative or you\u2019ve got not enough guidance and the troops now don\u2019t know which direction to head into. Or you get a company that\u2019s trying to take on too many projects or too many initiatives at the same time and they don\u2019t prioritize and execute, so they end up getting none of them done. Then obviously the most impactful one is when you have leaders and team members taking ownership, real ownership, extreme ownership, of everything in their world to make sure that problems that uncovered and owned and resolved. Because if leaders and members of the team, if they don\u2019t take ownership of the problems, then guess who solves the problems? Nobody. So these are all, again, fundamental problems that I saw when I was training SEAL platoons and it\u2019s the same thing I see now. It\u2019s the same solutions that we apply to these same problems. Learning the fundamental tactics of leadership is what we get down to. We\u2019ll see you at the muster. All right. This next question is from Damian Hudson: What does Jocko struggle with? Or maybe better to say, what is he at work on? He comes across bulletproof and just pushes through on everything. Would like to know his method for identifying weaknesses and putting structures in place to resolve, correct, improve. Would like to know his approach for his personal challenges. Well, first of all, I can assure you that I am far from bulletproof. When you ask what I struggle with, I struggle with everything. I\u2019m not naturally gifted at pretty much anything. I\u2019m not naturally strong. I\u2019m not naturally fast. I\u2019m certainly not the sharpest tool in the shed. So I constantly have to work on my weaknesses. If you want to know what my weaknesses are? We don\u2019t have enough time on the podcast to list all my weaknesses. That\u2019s the way it is. Now as far as my method for identify weaknesses, it\u2019s pretty simple. I\u2019m constantly doing self-assessment, detaching and looking at what I\u2019m doing and what I can do better. I ask people that are close to me, people that I trust, ask them if they have any feedback for me. Ask them if there\u2019s anything I could do better or where I can improve. So that\u2019s pretty simple. Do a self-assessment, ask other people and find out what your weaknesses are, what you could do better. Then the next part of the question is: What do I do to put structures in place to resolve, correct and improve? Well, I just attack those problems. Weakness identified? Roger. Attack the weakness. Problem identified? Roger. Attack the problem. I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m not a guy that spends a bunch of time over-analyzing or over-planning or diving deep into meditation on how I\u2019m going to attack a problem. I simply attack the problem. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that I blindly attack and it doesn\u2019t mean that I hold a course without checking on my progress. As I attack a problem, I\u2019m going to continually assess and make sure that I\u2019m on the right course and that I\u2019m headed in the right direction and making sure that it\u2019s the most efficient path. I will absolutely change course if I see something I can do better. Because I have that kind of attitude, it allows me to move quickly to execute and then initiate change and alter the course as I go if it\u2019s needed. It\u2019s the same attitude that I had when I was on the SEAL teams. I could be very decisive very quickly because the decisions themselves did not close my mind. The decisions did not close my mind. I would make a decision and I would continue to reassess and readjust as needed, but also as we moved forward towards a solution. So you got a problem? Step 1, identify the problem. Step 2, attack it. Step 3, reassess and adjust and keep attacking. Get that thing solved. Next question is from Chris Bell: How to stay motivated when every day is a struggle to accomplish goals? Well, I can tell you very easily, this isn\u2019t about motivation. That accomplishing your goals is not about motivation, it\u2019s about discipline. I already talked about that once today and I\u2019ll say it again. I probably talked about it more than once. I talked about it a bunch. I talk about it all the time. It is about discipline. Motivation is fickle. Motivation comes and goes. I mean, you think about motivation, something as simple as being hungry can sap your motivation. Right? That\u2019s ridiculous. You can\u2019t rely on that. You have, oh my blood sugar went down, I\u2019m not motivated anymore. Oh, I didn\u2019t get enough caffeine, I\u2019m not motivated. No, wrong answer. Motivation is unreliable. When you\u2019re counting on motivation to get your goals accomplished, you\u2019re likely going to fall short. So don\u2019t count on motivation. Count on discipline. You know what you have to do. Go make yourself do it. Make yourself do it. Everybody wants some kind of magic pill or some life hack or something that eliminates the need to do the work. Well, I will tell you what. You need to do the work. You\u2019ve got to hold the line. You\u2019ve got to make it happen yourself. You have to make it happen. It\u2019s not going to happen on its own. You have to make it happen. So dig in. Find the discipline. Be the discipline and accomplish the goals, period. That\u2019s it. Our next question is from Austin Farley. He said: Best advice to today\u2019s active duty force regardless of branch about career oversight, deployments, differences between all service members. Okay, so the basic question is best advice. Well, the advice besides be aggressive and stay safe \u2013 that\u2019s my No. 1.\u00a0I would tell you for me, the biggest component for success in the military, in my opinion, is to do a great job in whatever you\u2019re doing. I know that sounds pretty obvious, but I\u2019ll tell you, I saw a lot of guys over the years who were always looking for the next ticket to punch or the next good deal or the next job that they had to get to take to make a promotion or whatever. For me, for the most part, I just took what they gave me and I did the best I could at it. I\u2019ll tell you, not only did this keep the Navy happy, because the Navy had a trooper that was just getting after it, it also kept me happy because I wasn\u2019t sweating the promotion or the evaluations or any of the political stuff. I was just getting after it to the best of my ability. If you do that, in my opinion, if you do that, your career will take care of itself. You\u2019ll get the good jobs because people will want you in those good jobs. The other thing I would say is this: a big piece of being in the military is a gut check. It\u2019s hard work. It\u2019s either too hot or too cold. It\u2019s not enough food. It\u2019s not enough sleep. It\u2019s not enough water. It\u2019s hurry up and wait. It\u2019s plan for months to do nothing and then don\u2019t plan at all to do something for months. On top of all that, you throw the politics and the egos and the bureaucracy. When you mix all that together, it can be pretty miserable, but I will tell you this: all that misery? Relish it. Relish every moment of it because those hard things, those rough things? Those are a part of the experience of the military and it\u2019s experiences like that I promise you will \u2013 for some twisted reason \u2013 you will miss them when you leave. So don\u2019t hate them. Don\u2019t avoid them. Dive into them and kick them in the ass with a smile on your face. Because another thing is, that smile is contagious. You\u2019ll elevate the morale of your whole unit when you wear that smile. So have fun and kick ass at what you\u2019re doing. For those of you out there on the front lines? Like I said, be aggressive. The best way to mitigate risk on the battlefield is to be aggressive. Do not be reactive. Step up and get after it. By the way, to all you active duty folks, thank you for what you\u2019re doing. For the vets that are listening, thank you for what you did. Next up, I got a question from Paul Wetkick. It says, \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d this is to Tim, I guess. Unfortunately, you, Rogan and Harris all pussyfooted around him. I realize he\u2019s probably an intimidating presence, but ask him how he feels about killing people, especially possibly innocents. Don\u2019t let him use \u2018doing my job, bad guys, collateral damage\u2019 narratives. Ask him how he feels about it. He\u2019s intelligent enough to cope with being pressed for an authentic answer. So Paul wants to know about killing people and possibly killing innocent people and how I feel about that. So first of all, the nature of war is death. The nature of war is killing. That is what war is. Of course, there\u2019s all kinds of other components to war. There\u2019s economic and cultural and diplomatic and strategic. But at its fundamental core, war is about death and war is about killing. In the question here, I\u2019m told I\u2019m not allowed to use the narrative of doing my job, but there\u2019s a reason why that narrative exists. Because death and killing actually is the job of a soldier. We train for that job. When the time comes, we do our job and we are good with it. Now, part of that comes from the training. Part of that also comes from the dehumanization of the enemy. Yes, that is a true statement. The enemy becomes dehumanized to the soldier. That\u2019s one of the reasons why soldiers are generally okay with it. In the past, the military had to help that process along. They had to help the soldier dehumanize the enemy. It still does do that to some extent, but I think in the wars that we are in now, we don\u2019t need any help dehumanizing the enemy. The enemy dehumanizes himself. You see, we in the military, we witness what they do. We see what they do. We see the results of the torture and the rape and the murder. We see families beheaded. We see people skinned alive. We see young people, kids \u2013 kids forced to carry out suicide bombings. And now with the internet in action, the whole world can see the completely despicable and brutal behavior of these sub-human savages burning people alive, throwing people from buildings, drowning people in cages, 10-year-old sex slaves. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting and abhorrent. I will tell you that I have no problem whatsoever killing all these vile creatures, all of them. Now, you also ask about killing innocents, killing innocent people. As I already stated, the nature of war is death. In war, innocent people sometimes are killed. You want to know how I feel about it? Well, it is horrible. It is horrible. It is awful when it does occur. And yes, it does occur. Let me tell you that America goes through great lengths, extreme lengths and in doing so, incurs incredible risk to prevent killing innocent people on the battlefield. When I fought with the 11AD in the Battle of Ramadi in 2006, the entire strategy, the entire strategy was developed to minimize not only the killing of innocent people, but also to minimize the amount of infrastructure that was destroyed. So the buildings and the power and the water, all of that. Again, American troops took incredible risks, incredible risks to mitigate the risk to civilians. But war is messy. War is confusing. War is imperfect. War is hell. Despite all the efforts that we make, despite all the good intentions and the precautions and the planning, sometimes innocent people are killed and it\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible for the family of the slain and it\u2019s horrible for the military man that pulled the trigger or dropped the bomb or threw the grenade. It\u2019s horrible for the mission because in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, we are there to protect the local populace so it takes us backward strategically as we try to win the hearts and minds of the people. But you know what? It doesn\u2019t defeat us. It doesn\u2019t beat us. And it doesn\u2019t even turn the local populace against us. I\u2019m speaking now from my experience in the Battle of Ramadi. Let it be perfectly clear that the local population in Ramadi absolutely wanted us there. They wanted us on the ground in their neighborhoods. They wanted us to help them get rid of the insurgents that were terrorizing them, literally terrorizing them. When innocent people were killed for whatever reason, we apologized. We did what we could to help and we met and we broke bread and we explained what had gone wrong and we asked what we could do to help. We paid them money and we helped them repair their buildings. We did whatever we could. I will tell you, and this never gets represented in the press, but most of the time the local populace, they understood. They understood it was a war. They understood it was a war against evil and they understood that meant violence. They understood that in our efforts to help them get rid of the cancer that ravaged their city, well they understood that there would be bloodshed in removing that cancer. War is hell. It is best to be avoided at all costs so that innocent lives are not lost. But sometimes war cannot be avoided and sometimes war should not be avoided. Sometimes in order to protect the innocents, war is the only choice. I am thankful that there are men and women in the military that have the courage and the strength and the moral fortitude to stand up and face evil and to also withstand the awful burden of killing and of death. Now I think this is the last question here. This question came from Andy Vassely. It says: What are the biggest lessons learned from Jiu-Jitsu that transcend the art of fighting itself and can be applied to being an effective leader? So I\u2019m a practitioner of Jiu-Jitsu. It\u2019s a pretty incredible thing to train. For those of you that train Jiu-Jitsu, you know what I\u2019m talking about. For those of you that don\u2019t train Jiu-Jitsu, go train Jiu-Jitsu because there\u2019s so much to be learned from Jiu-Jitsu about leadership and about life. For instance, I talked a lot about discipline today. In Jiu-Jitsu, you\u2019re going to learn about discipline because it takes discipline to get on the mat day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. You won\u2019t always feel like training. As fun as Jiu-Jitsu is, there\u2019s going to be days you don\u2019t feel like training, but you have to find the discipline and you have to do it. So you\u2019re going to learn about discipline in Jiu-Jitsu. You\u2019re also going to learn about humility because in Jiu-Jitsu, you will get humbled. You will get beat by people that are smaller than you and weaker than you, and they will smash you. They will literally submit you. That is humbling and there is no escaping it. Those are very important because like I said, I\u2019ve said this before, is that those are lessons that some traditional martial arts would try and teach you almost as theoretical lessons. Like you must be disciplined. They\u2019ll tell you that in theory. But in Jiu-Jitsu, like I said, without discipline, there\u2019s no progress. In a traditional martial art, they\u2019ll say you must be humble. Like I said, in Jiu-Jitsu, you actually get humbled. So Jiu-Jitsu teaches you a lot about life. That\u2019s one of the things that makes it so powerful. Back to the question, what does it teach you about leadership? It absolutely teaches you some key things about leadership and I\u2019ll give you a couple of the most important elements. First of all, detachment. I\u2019ve mentioned this word a couple times today. In Jiu-Jitsu, I\u2019ll tell you right now, if you let yourself start to get frustrated or you let yourself start to get angry or just emotional in general, you will start to make bad decisions. When you start to make bad decisions that is the beginning of the end. So you have to be able to detach from that emotion, that frustration and you got to focus on doing the right thing at the right time. It\u2019s absolutely necessary. That\u2019s the same thing in a combat leadership position or in any leadership situation. You cannot get caught up in all the chaos and all mayhem. You can\u2019t let your emotions get hold of you, so you have to be able to detach from that. You have to be able to step back and breathe and see the full picture of what is happening without the cloud of emotion and all that mayhem obscuring your vision so that you can make good decisions. Jiu-Jitsu will teach you to do that. Another piece of Jiu-Jitsu that transfers directly into leadership is the idea of indirect warfare. So in Jiu-Jitsu, the whole premise is to attack the weaknesses of your opponent. You don\u2019t want to attack their strengths. Just fundamentally, you attack the weak areas of their body, like the joints or the neck. You\u2019re not attacking the strongest parts of their body. If you attack where your opponent is strong, so if you have an opponent that\u2019s very good at defending one type of one position or one type of hold, you\u2019re just going to wear yourself out if you\u2019re attacking that. Eventually, you\u2019re going to run out of energy and then they\u2019re going to get the advantage. So you can\u2019t just attack the strengths. You have to attack the weak points in Jiu-Jitsu. Now on top of that, you also have to distract your opponent. You have to make them defend some area. So you might maybe attack one area so they put their defenses there, but it\u2019s just a feint. Because what you\u2019re really going to do is you\u2019re going to attack an area where they\u2019re not defending. You\u2019re going to attack their weak areas. It\u2019s the same thing with leadership. The clearest example of where this is directly seen in leadership is when you\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s egos. So you take a person that has a big, strong ego. You don\u2019t attack that ego head on. That will just make that person get ultra-defensive. If you attack their ego, they\u2019re going to get defensive immediately. Now you\u2019ve built up and you\u2019re going to have an even harder fight. So what you do is you bypass their ego. Maybe you even massage their ego a little bit so that they let down their guard. So that they let you into their head a little bit and then tactically and quietly you sneak in and you plant the seeds of what you\u2019re trying to get them to do. Of where you\u2019re trying to lead them. Soon enough, without seeing it, those seeds are going to grow and your idea and your plan and your leadership comes to fruition. That is indirect warfare. It\u2019s the same thing in Jiu-Jitsu, it\u2019s the same thing in business and it\u2019s actually the same thing on the battlefield as well. We don\u2019t attack enemy strengths unless it cannot be avoided. So take up that Jiu-Jitsu. Start training and apply those lessons across the board in your life. I think that\u2019s it for questions for now. Thanks to everybody for listening and thanks, of course, to Mr. Tim Ferriss, for having me on. Tim has been, for those of you who don\u2019t know, he\u2019s been a huge supporter since I met him. I really appreciate, Tim, everything you\u2019ve done for me and everything that\u2019s kind of stemmed from that has been awesome. The interaction from everybody through social media and Twitter and Facebook and all that and everyone that\u2019s listening and giving me feedback on the podcast that I have and the book that I wrote with my buddy, Leif. It\u2019s just awesome to connect with so many people and it\u2019s awesome to know that there\u2019s so many people that are in the game. So many people that want to get after it. Just like me, looking to get better, looking to do better, looking to be better. So thanks to everybody for everything. Like I said, especially thanks to Tim for kicking this whole thing off. So until next time, this is Jocko. Out.

submitted questions", "i\u2019m going to try and get to as many as i can here", "all right, the first one is from a guy by the name of jeffrey mcleod", "the question is: how do you shut internal doubt down and negative chatter out of your head during critical, must-do moments", "how do you change emotional negative focus states when something or someone knocks you off focus", "first of all, internal doubt is not necessarily a bad thing", "i\u2019ve said this before about fear of failure", "because internal doubt \u2013 first of all, that\u2019s a form of humility and obviously humility is a good thing and that internal doubt and that fear of failure is the thing that keeps you up at night preparing", "that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s not going to let you cut corners", "it\u2019s that little voice inside your head that\u2019s whispering, \u201crehearse again", "practice again", "do it again over and over again.\u201d that\u2019s the voice that says to do everything you can to be ready", "so i\u2019m okay with that", "i\u2019m okay with that little internal doubt", "but this doesn\u2019t mean that you lack confidence", "as a matter of fact, when you prepare correctly, when you have the discipline to prepare correctly, then you will have confidence", "that is definitely a good feeling to have because all that negative chatter that you\u2019re talking about here, here\u2019s the deal with that", "every repetition of practice that you do, every iteration of rehearsal that you complete, every bit of study that you do and every drill that you do, all that preparation is going to drown out the negative chatter", "so you got to prepare", "now, then we get to this piece here", "it was, how do you change emotional negative focus states when something or someone knocks you off focus", "well, i think this is where it\u2019s important to have that ability to detach", "and it isn\u2019t like you\u2019re going to completely detach and not feel those things at all", "not like you\u2019re going to make those emotions disappear", "it\u2019s not even like you\u2019d want them to disappear completely because those things are normal", "but what you have to do when you detach is it\u2019s going to allow you to see those emotions or that negative focus and see it from a distance and then understand that they are there and then make sure that they don\u2019t overwhelm you", "and so like in your head, you\u2019re going to be saying oh, okay, i see that", "that\u2019s some nervousness sneaking up on me", "got it", "that\u2019s a good sign because that means my mind is focused and i\u2019m in the game", "okay", "what\u2019s next", "oh, got some negative thoughts", "okay", "well, those are normal", "and i\u2019ve got to know that things are going to go bad and that\u2019s fine", "how bad can they go", "what\u2019s a worst case scenario", "worst case scenario is not that big of a deal", "i know i can handle the worst case scenario if it happens, so what else", "what else is in my mind", "what else negative thought am i having", "what about those things that you can\u2019t control", "the things that you can\u2019t control and you\u2019re worried about those things", "well, you know what", "i can\u2019t control them", "so if i can\u2019t control them, why worry about them", "because the energy that you put into worrying about them actually costs you your effectiveness", "it\u2019s going to cut into the energy you should be putting towards achieving what you\u2019re trying to achieve", "so focus on the things that you can control and make the things that you can\u2019t control 100 percent", "the bottom line: with all this with these negative thoughts, if i give everything i can, if i prepare as hard as i can, if i practice as much as i can, if i do have a rehearsal and i do everything i can, and i still come up short", "good", "i\u2019m going to learn from it", "i\u2019m going to get better", "so that\u2019s what i\u2019m going to do with the internal doubt", "i\u2019m okay with it", "negative chatter \u2013 i\u2019m going to utilize it and i\u2019m just going to detach a little bit to make sure i don\u2019t get downed out in these emotional situations", "so just get your head in the game and get after it", "done", "okay", "next question", "next question comes from will gendron", "he says: how does his love and study of literature influence his leadership skills", "what were some of the best books for developing his knowledge of leadership", "okay", "so the thing that i look for when i\u2019m reading.\u00a0when i\u2019m reading, that includes everything", "let\u2019s just talk about everything here: books, history books, literature, even poetry and even song lyrics; everything", "i\u2019m trying to learn about human nature", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m looking for", "and of course, since combat is like life amplified and intensified, which is something we say all the time, a lot of times the books that are about war give some of the best insight into human nature", "you\u2019re talking about the stress and the fear and the courage and the breaking points, and the darkness of humanity, and also the beauty of humanity", "all those can be seen in their most extreme and their most obvious form in war", "so a lot of books that i do read are about war and i have a ton of them", "and again, they\u2019re not so much leadership books by definition", "as a matter of fact, i don\u2019t even know if i have any \u201cleadership\u201d books", "but i got a ton of books that have taught me a ton about leadership", "first and foremost, and i said this when i was on tim\u2019s podcast for the first time, about face by colonel david hackworth, it\u2019s the only book i\u2019ve ever actually given anyone", "it\u2019s a big book", "people that have bought it \u2013 people on twitter who have gone out and bought that book, it\u2019s a 700-page book", "it is a big book", "it spans from the tail end of world war ii through korea, vietnam and a little bit of post-vietnam", "it\u2019s a big book", "it\u2019s a career military guy", "colonel hackworth was just an incredible leader", "you don\u2019t just get that from the book", "when you learn about hackworth, if you start digging in and hearing what other people\u2019s opinions are, people loved him, especially the people that worked for him loved him", "now, obviously, he had some trouble up the chain of command at certain points, but that\u2019s part of being a dynamic leader, i guess", "he held his ground on some stuff", "so that book is just an incredible book", "it\u2019s got lessons learned on every page", "i cover most of the books that i\u2019ve heard that have had a huge impact on me", "i\u2019m covering them on my podcast", "so books like with the old breed, by eugene sledge", "beyond band of brothers by dick winters", "i remember the last war by a guy named bob hoffman", "another book by hackworth called steal my soldier\u2019s heart", "a book called platoon leader by jim mcdonough", "another good vietnam one, the killing zone by frederick downs", "those books, you could just go on and on", "again, it\u2019s not always clear that oh, here\u2019s the leadership principle; here\u2019s what you should be doing", "no, it\u2019s not always clear like that", "but when you understand what people are going through emotionally and you start to get a glimpse at human nature and how people react in certain situations and how their egos flare up, that\u2019s what makes these books good", "because it gives you a frame of reference", "i\u2019m still reading all the time", "i\u2019m still learning, still trying to get better, still trying to take what other people have been through, how they handled it, what they did right, what they did wrong, mistakes they made", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m trying to do", "i think that\u2019s actually one of the things that has made my podcast become popular because i look at these other people\u2019s experiences and i compare them with mine", "it\u2019s just always, i\u2019m always learning", "i talk about the mistakes that i made and even the book that i wrote with leif, it certainly isn\u2019t any kind of a chronically of our triumphs", "if anything, it\u2019s the opposite in many cases because much of the book is about mistakes that we made", "it\u2019s about things we could\u2019ve done better and lessons that we learned", "i think that\u2019s why that book, extreme ownership, has done well", "it\u2019s something you can learn from and people learn the most, myself included, when you fail", "so read and read and read some more", "pay attention to, in my mind, pay attention to the details", "again, not just the leadership, but the human element, the human interaction, the glimpses into the core of human nature", "the bigger bank you build of experiencing how humans react, the more you know", "then you take that and you overlay the experiences you read about over what\u2019s happening in your world", "i think a key point is to actually think about how what you\u2019re reading applies to what\u2019s happening in your world", "then you start to pay attention to human nature in your world and you see that there\u2019s some underlying force that makes people do what they do", "the better you can understand that force of human nature, the better off you\u2019re going to be and the better job you\u2019re going to do as a leader, so keep reading", "next up, i got a guy here named kip mackanoonie: what would his advice be to young men and women who are no longer in the military, but are still looking to contribute", "also, has he considered running for any public office position", "so if you were in the military and you got out \u2013 either you retired or you just did your time and you got out, go out and put those skills that you got from the military, put those skills to work", "the discipline, the work ethic, the leadership, the ability to detach, the ability to instruct", "there are industries \u2013 i\u2019m telling you, i work with businesses all the time now and there are industries that need you", "in fact, i will tell you that most industries need people like you, people like veterans", "and so find an industry that you\u2019re interested in and go get busy", "go get after it", "make that your next mission", "if there are no industries that interest you, which is kind of hard to believe that you would have no interest, but if you don\u2019t, or if you\u2019re looking for something that maybe has more internal meaning, then go out and find a really good non-profit organization that needs help", "because again, they need the same thing", "they need people, they need leaders, they need people that are disciplined, they need people that can solve problems, they need people with the skills that you have, the skills that you learned in the military", "so go and put those to work", "i will tell you that america, as a whole, needs leadership", "so there\u2019s no reason that veterans, like i said, who have a lot of those skills from being in the military and from being deployed overseas, there\u2019s no reason that veterans shouldn\u2019t make up a big portion of leaders in the civilian sector", "so step up and get after it", "one last thing about that is there\u2019s a lot of companies \u2013 and again, i work with all kinds of different companies \u2013 all kinds of companies want to hire veterans", "they recognize that their success is based on the freedoms that they have, so they want to pay back somehow", "so many companies are anxious and eager to hire veterans", "so get out there, find what you\u2019re interested in and make it happen", "now, the other part of this question as far as running for political office", "i say this all the time; this is kind of a canned answer", "i don\u2019t think i have the stomach for it", "the corruption and the sliminess of the whole thing", "not to mention just the complete loss of privacy and the scheduling and the whole meeting of people that i don\u2019t like and having to be civil to them", "the whole thing", "it\u2019s like i said, i don\u2019t think i have the stomach for it", "i guess that perhaps at some point that feeling could be overridden", "if things got bad enough, i would definitely have a sense of duty and i\u2019m a very patriotic person", "if the nation truly needed me, then of course i would serve", "but until that time, i\u2019m going to go ahead and just steer clear of any political endeavors", "okay", "the next question is from adrian marquez", "it says: any considerations regarding being a pawn of the \u2014 and he says \u2014 industrial military conflicts", " and maybe he means \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d", "i\u2019m not sure, but we\u2019ll go with it", "so again: any considerations regarding being a pawn of the industrial military conflicts to serve the economic interests of u.s", "corporations", "would he do it all over again", "the next part of the question is: what\u2019s next", "make up another excuse", "invade an african nation for resources", "so, of course, when you are serving in the u.s", "military, you are serving", "at least, you should be serving the interests of the united states of america, absolutely", "and embedded in those interests, there are absolutely the economic interests of american corporations", "obviously, the economic power of the united states is a key component of america\u2019s power and influence in the world", "so yeah, when you are a military member, you could be considered a pawn in the military machine", "but the fact of the matter is, i am actually honored to have served as a so-called \u201cpawn\u201d in that system", "i will tell you this and i\u2019ve said this before, america is far from perfect", "we have committed some horrors in our history", "even today, we make mistakes in the world", "but when you travel the world and you see how much of the rest of the world lives, how much they live in disarray, and you see the oppression and you see the poverty and you see the corruption and you see the abject violations of basic human rights, then you realize how blessed or lucky or maybe even spoiled we are to live in america", "just to start, let\u2019s just start with potable tap water, drinking water", "in america, we just have that here", "we have it everywhere", "any home, any apartment, even the prisons", "you turn on the tap and you get good, clean, disease-free drinking water", "that is not the norm in the rest of the world", "on top of that, we have power", "got electricity going into just about every home", "that means just about every home has heat in the wintertime and they have air conditioning in the summertime", "let\u2019s just take it a little bit further", "what about the access to the internet", "the access to the internet here is widespread", "there\u2019s something like 70 percent of the adults in america have a smartphone", "70 percent", "so 70 percent", "so you can gain access to knowledge here unlike any other time in human history", "our healthcare system \u2013 i know it\u2019s not perfect", "but i tell you what, if you view our healthcare system from a third-world hospital, which often don\u2019t even have the simplest of medical gear, you\u2019d realize it might not be perfect, but it\u2019s pretty damn good", "and then beyond that, let\u2019s look at the food that\u2019s available", "never mind starvation and malnutrition", "our issue in america is actually too much food", "much of the world still has people literally starving to death", "america offers an amazing opportunity to build and to create and to be what you want to be and to be who you want to be", "unlike anywhere else in the world, the ability to pursue happiness", "happiness", "all those things, all of it, is possible because of the unbridled, individual freedom that america offers", "you know what else", "it\u2019s also possible because of industry", "because of the incredible corporations and businesses and individuals", "because of people who took advantage of that freedom and worked their asses off to build this nation", "so to have been a pawn in that", "to have done my small share of work to allow this beacon of light and of hope and of freedom to continue", "i\u2019m honored that i had the chance", "would i do it all again", "you\u2019re damn right i would", "without question", "then there\u2019s another piece to this question from mr", "marquez", "it says: what\u2019s next", "make up another excuse", "invade an african nation for resources", "well, luckily, we have plenty of resources in our own nation and luckily for the rest of the world, we have used those resources over and over and over again, not to take, but to give", "to give freedom to the slaves in our own country, to defeat and destroy the brutal nazi regime in germany and free the people of france and much of europe", "we used our resources to defeat imperial japan, who was rampaging through asia, invading and enslaving people with so sign of stopping", "we used our resources to try and stop the spread of communism in asia", "remember that when i\u2019m talking about resources, i\u2019m not just talking about oil and steel and wood", "i\u2019m talking about blood", "i\u2019m talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of american men and women that gave their lives in the cause of freedom", "what resources did we take when we paid with our blood", "we took nothing", "we took no resources from the germans", "we helped them rebuild into an economic superpower", "we took no resources form the japanese", "we helped them rebuild into an economic superpower", "the japanese and the germans both have some of the highest standards of living in the world", "we took nothing from korea or vietnam", "we took nothing from afghanistan and even iraq", "we took nothing", "we only gave", "we continue to give", "in 2014, the u.s", "government gave $43 billion in foreign aid", "then there was another $23 billion on top of that from america from religious organizations and universities and colleges and private voluntary organizations and even the big american corporations", "now, like i said, that doesn\u2019t mean that america is perfect", "far from it", "far from it", "our past is checkered with horrible mistakes that we\u2019ve made as a nation", "we\u2019ve caused massive hardships and incredible suffering", "but we also evolved", "we have become a benevolent nation, a good nation", "i know this because i saw it with my own two eyes", "i saw the people of iraq, who wanted freedom from the tyranny of saddam hussein, who then wanted protection from the violent terrorist extremists who cheered us in the streets when we killed insurgents and who wept when we left them", "unfortunately, who were murdered when we abandoned them because the politics in our own country", "they wanted us in iraq", "the people of iraq", "the normal citizens, they wanted our protection and they wanted our positivity", "they wanted freedom, like much of the world does", "i was honored to have done my small part to provide the opportunity for freedom around the world and to protect that precious freedom which is all too often taken for granted here at home", "now, the next question", "the next question is from someone named don ryan", "he says: what\u2019s the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever gone through and what do you foresee as the toughest thing on the horizon you\u2019ll endure", "well, the hardest thing i\u2019ve ever gone through is losing my men in combat", "i say \u201cmy men,\u201d but they weren\u2019t my men", "they were my friends and they were my brothers", "barring the loss of any members of my direct family, i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll ever have to endure anything as soul crushing and devastating as losing my friends in combat", "next question", "this is from nathan lowe: what advice would you give an active duty navy seal or other military personnel following the election if hillary is elected or if trump is elected", " well, the fact of the matter is either hillary or trump will be elected", "the seals, just like the rest of the military, will do what the military always does and what they are sworn to do", "if you don\u2019t know what that is, i wrote down here the oath of enlistment", "i\u2019ll read it to you so you know what it says", "it says, \u201ci do solemnly swear that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that i will obey the orders of the president of the united states and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the uniform code of military justice", "so help me god.\u201d so that\u2019s the oath that you swear to when you join the military", "you\u2019re going to obey those orders", "now, there is a little bit of a caveat", "that is in the uniform code of military justice, article 92", "because it gets a little bit more specific", "the article is entitled, \u201cfailure to obey order or regulation.\u201d \u201cany person subject to this chapter who (1) violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation; (2) having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by any member of the armed forces, which it is his duty to obey, fails to obey the order; or (3) is derelict in the performance of his duties; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d so the key words there are \u201clawful order.\u201d they made this perfectly clear during the nuremberg trials, when the nazi war criminals claimed that they were just following orders", "well, in america that doesn\u2019t cut it", "they have to be lawful orders", "so regardless if hillary clinton, donald trump, obama, bush, nixon, jfk or reagan, it doesn\u2019t matter", "the military will carry out the lawful orders of the president and that\u2019s that", "next question is from a.j", "nystrom", "he says: jocko, in your book you speak about leadership down and up the chain of command", "what, in your opinion and experience, is the most effective way to get leadership up the chain to wake up and break the cycle of rubberstamping ineffective practices, especially in law enforcement", "this is a big question", "i\u2019ll tell you first things first", "the first thing you have to do is be awesome", "that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do", "seriously", "you\u2019ve got to be the best police officer you can be", "this goes for any job", "you\u2019ve got to build the best possible reputation", "that means you\u2019ve got to follow the rules, even the stupid, inconsequential rules", "all of them", "become the front runner, the top dog", "now that doesn\u2019t mean you become the loudmouth or the attention grabber, but you become the best, legit police officer you can possibly be", "not only is this going to build your reputation, it\u2019s also going to start to build your relationships up the chain of command", "that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do", "you\u2019re trying to build some relationships here", "the reason for that is you need to build up the capital, the leadership capital, the respect capital, so that you can ask some legitimate questions", "when the time comes, you go and you ask those questions", "actually, i shouldn\u2019t say ask questions, because that gives them a setup to provide you with the answers and you already know the answers and you don\u2019t agree with them", "so instead of asking questions, you take the reputation you built as a badass and you raise points", "when you raise points, you have solutions", "you have solutions that you\u2019ve already socialized with the team which you\u2019ve already maybe even tested or you\u2019ve at least tried", "in other words, these are solutions that you know are going to work", "also \u2013 pick your battles", "pick your battles", "you\u2019re going to have to eat some stupid stuff", "you\u2019re going to do some lame things", "but you\u2019ve got to pick your battles", "you\u2019re not going to be able to change everything, so you\u2019ve got to pick the most impactful issues to deal with", "the other ones", "you support those and you follow those like a good soldier, because that gives you more capital when you do raise issues", "here\u2019s the other piece when you raise issues up the chain of command", "this is a piece that people mess up all the time", "when you raise these points up the chain of command and when you give the solutions, you have to do it from a point of humility", "you can\u2019t be looking for the credit", "you can\u2019t be looking for the atta-boy", "you\u2019ve got to come across and you\u2019ve got to not just come across, you\u2019ve got to actually be the humble person putting forth some suggestions on how to do things better", "i\u2019ll tell you the absolute black belt move is when you get them to think that it\u2019s their idea and that they came up with it and that they\u2019ve made up that solution", "that\u2019s the ultimate black belt move", "that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking to achieve and that is how you win", "that is what i did with my career", "i worked as hard as i could", "i followed everything they told me, but when something stood out, i was able to attack it, address it and get the problem solved or changed because i had built up that capital", "so build your reputation, build your relationships, build and vet your idea and your solution, and then present it with humility", "next question is from a guy named jonathan mule: how would his lifestyle of extreme discipline translate to someone living a seemingly unrelated life", "artists, writers, etc., who might find more productivity in pockets of leisure or late at night", "now, i would argue that in these creative pursuits, you actually require even more discipline", "i would venture to guess that the biggest reason that creative types, people in creative industries, the reason that they don\u2019t produce isn\u2019t because they don\u2019t have vision and it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t have talent", "i can just about guarantee that in most cases, it\u2019s a lack of discipline", "i\u2019m always saying about working out, the weights in the gym aren\u2019t going to lift themselves; you\u2019ve got to go lift them", "well, it\u2019s the same thing with a book", "that book isn\u2019t going to write itself; you\u2019ve got to write it", "the painting isn\u2019t going to paint itself; you\u2019ve got to paint it", "and if you don\u2019t feel like writing or drawing, or painting, or composing, that doesn\u2019t matter", "you do it anyways", "you grit down and you force the words onto the paper or you force the brush onto the paper", "or you force the notes out of the instrument", "that\u2019s what you have to do", "you have to make it happen", "you have to force yourself to do it", "it\u2019s not always going to be good", "you might go back, you might write 1,000 words and you might delete 950 of them, but you got 50 words", "50 words that you didn\u2019t have before", "50 words that you\u2019ve created that are solid", "50 words closer to reaching your goal", "now, as far as the time of day goes, to me it doesn\u2019t matter", "if you have some kind of time of day where things seem to flow better or whatever", "great", "take advantage of it", "i think people think because i wake up early, which i do, that i believe that everyone must do that", "but honestly, it\u2019s not true; it\u2019s the principle", "it\u2019s about the principle, not about the specific time", "i\u2019ve got to throw a big \u201cbut\u201d on that", "because although you can maybe work at different times or maybe you stay up later or maybe do better work at 2:00 in the morning or 3:00 in the morning and so there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting up at 4:30, that\u2019s okay", "but that doesn\u2019t mean oversleep and it doesn\u2019t mean procrastinate and it doesn\u2019t mean hit the snooze button", "it doesn\u2019t mean staying up late diving into the depths of useless youtube videos and claim that is you being creative", "do not lie to yourself", "that there\u2019s a decent chance that being creative is actually being lazy in your mind", "do not fall into that trap", "i\u2019ll tell you something else", "in order to gain skills, in order to master your craft, any craft, you have to practice", "you have to practice and practice and practice over and over and over again and again", "that requires discipline", "that requires discipline and that is another example of how discipline will equal freedom", "the more you practice your craft, the better you get at it, the more freedom you have to create", "so build the structure and follow it", "put the discipline into your life", "the discipline will increase your skills and it will increase your productivity and the discipline will set you free", "now, going onto the next question here", "will the muster event \u2013 oh, sorry", "this is from marco lopez: will the muster event be a once-a-year thing only", "after working with and training so many different companies, are there any repeating patterns or common weaknesses that business owner need to seem to work on", "it also says: \u201cwill you please encourage jocko to do another joe rogan podcast?\u201d so, right on", "joe knows i\u2019m standing by",

that one", "all right", "to get to the question here, for those of you that don\u2019t know, the extreme ownership muster is a leadership event that we\u2019re having in san diego, california", "i\u2019m doing it with my business partner, the co-author of the book, extreme ownership, leif babin, who is a seal that i worked with for many years and my brother", "we\u2019re holding this thing in san diego, california on october 20th and 21st", "what the event is going to be about is combat leadership", "that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be about", "it\u2019s going to be about combat leadership and we\u2019re going to teach the fundamental principles of combat leadership and how to apply them on the battlefield, in business, and in life", "all three", "you\u2019re going to see when you come how all three of the applications are the same", "these fundamental combat leadership principles \u2013 they don\u2019t change, regardless of whether you\u2019re out hunting down bad guys, or whether you\u2019re hunting for a sale", "they don\u2019t change", "the response to the event has been awesome", "we\u2019ve got a ton of people coming to it, which likely means it looks like we\u2019re going to do another event possibly", "we\u2019ve got to carve the time out of the schedule, but it looks like possibly the spring of 2017", "likely going to be somewhere on the east coast", "if it\u2019s going to be somewhere on the east coast, there\u2019s probably a pretty good chance we\u2019ll be looking at new york city", "it\u2019s not set in stone that we\u2019re going to do it; not set in stone when we\u2019re going to do it", "we might wait another year", "i don\u2019t know yet", "it\u2019s just up in the air", "we have so much stuff on our plates right now that we\u2019ve got to figure out if we can fit it in", "but if we do it again, maybe we\u2019ll head out to the east coast and new york city and get some", "the next part of this question is: are there any repeating patterns or common weaknesses that business owners need to work on", "the answer is yes, absolutely there are", "we see the same issues from company to company and from leader to leader", "the same issues that we see in the civilian sector are the same issues that we saw while we were working with seal platoons and training seal platoons", "the core problems that we see are what we wrote about in the book, extreme ownership", "that\u2019s one of the reasons we wrote the book was because when we worked with these companies, people would say, \u201cdo you have this stuff written down anywhere?\u201d and eventually we wrote it down", "now what are some of those issues that we run into", "i mean, you\u2019ve got departments and divisions that aren\u2019t working together to cover a move", "you\u2019ve got communications not being made in a simple, clear, concise manner", "you\u2019ve got either too much micro management, which leaves the troops to take no initiative or you\u2019ve got not enough guidance and the troops now don\u2019t know which direction to head into", "or you get a company that\u2019s trying to take on too many projects or too many initiatives at the same time and they don\u2019t prioritize and execute, so they end up getting none of them done", "then obviously the most impactful one is when you have leaders and team members taking ownership, real ownership, extreme ownership, of everything in their world to make sure that problems that uncovered and owned and resolved", "because if leaders and members of the team, if they don\u2019t take ownership of the problems, then guess who solves the problems", "nobody", "so these are all, again, fundamental problems that i saw when i was training seal platoons and it\u2019s the same thing i see now", "it\u2019s the same solutions that we apply to these same problems", "learning the fundamental tactics of leadership is what we get down to", "we\u2019ll see you at the muster", "all right", "this next question is from damian hudson: what does jocko struggle with", "or maybe better to say, what is he at work on", "he comes across bulletproof and just pushes through on everything", "would like to know his method for identifying weaknesses and putting structures in place to resolve, correct, improve", "would like to know his approach for his personal challenges", "well, first of all, i can assure you that i am far from bulletproof", "when you ask what i struggle with, i struggle with everything", "i\u2019m not naturally gifted at pretty much anything", "i\u2019m not naturally strong", "i\u2019m not naturally fast", "i\u2019m certainly not the sharpest tool in the shed", "so i constantly have to work on my weaknesses", "if you want to know what my weaknesses are", "we don\u2019t have enough time on the podcast to list all my weaknesses", "that\u2019s the way it is", "now as far as my method for identify weaknesses, it\u2019s pretty simple", "i\u2019m constantly doing self-assessment, detaching and looking at what i\u2019m doing and what i can do better", "i ask people that are close to me, people that i trust, ask them if they have any feedback for me", "ask them if there\u2019s anything i could do better or where i can improve", "so that\u2019s pretty simple", "do a self-assessment, ask other people and find out what your weaknesses are, what you could do better", "then the next part of the question is: what do i do to put structures in place to resolve, correct and improve", "well, i just attack those problems", "weakness identified", "roger", "attack the weakness", "problem identified", "roger", "attack the problem", "i\u2019ll tell you, i\u2019m not a guy that spends a bunch of time over-analyzing or over-planning or diving deep into meditation on how i\u2019m going to attack a problem", "i simply attack the problem", "now, that doesn\u2019t mean that i blindly attack and it doesn\u2019t mean that i hold a course without checking on my progress", "as i attack a problem, i\u2019m going to continually assess and make sure that i\u2019m on the right course and that i\u2019m headed in the right direction and making sure that it\u2019s the most efficient path", "i will absolutely change course if i see something i can do better", "because i have that kind of attitude, it allows me to move quickly to execute and then initiate change and alter the course as i go if it\u2019s needed", "it\u2019s the same attitude that i had when i was on the seal teams", "i could be very decisive very quickly because the decisions themselves did not close my mind", "the decisions did not close my mind", "i would make a decision and i would continue to reassess and readjust as needed, but also as we moved forward towards a solution", "so you got a problem", "step 1, identify the problem", "step 2, attack it", "step 3, reassess and adjust and keep attacking", "get that thing solved", "next question is from chris bell: how to stay motivated when every day is a struggle to accomplish goals", "well, i can tell you very easily, this isn\u2019t about motivation", "that accomplishing your goals is not about motivation, it\u2019s about discipline", "i already talked about that once today and i\u2019ll say it again", "i probably talked about it more than once", "i talked about it a bunch", "i talk about it all the time", "it is about discipline", "motivation is fickle", "motivation comes and goes", "i mean, you think about motivation, something as simple as being hungry can sap your motivation", "right", "that\u2019s ridiculous", "you can\u2019t rely on that", "you have, oh my blood sugar went down, i\u2019m not motivated anymore", "oh, i didn\u2019t get enough caffeine, i\u2019m not motivated", "no, wrong answer", "motivation is unreliable", "when you\u2019re counting on motivation to get your goals accomplished, you\u2019re likely going to fall short", "so don\u2019t count on motivation", "count on discipline", "you know what you have to do", "go make yourself do it", "make yourself do it", "everybody wants some kind of magic pill or some life hack or something that eliminates the need to do the work", "well, i will tell you what", "you need to do the work", "you\u2019ve got to hold the line", "you\u2019ve got to make it happen yourself", "you have to make it happen", "it\u2019s not going to happen on its own", "you have to make it happen", "so dig in", "find the discipline", "be the discipline and accomplish the goals, period", "that\u2019s it", "our next question is from austin farley", "he said: best advice to today\u2019s active duty force regardless of branch about career oversight, deployments, differences between all service members", "okay, so the basic question is best advice", "well, the advice besides be aggressive and stay safe \u2013 that\u2019s my no", "1.\u00a0i would tell you for me, the biggest component for success in the military, in my opinion, is to do a great job in whatever you\u2019re doing", "i know that sounds pretty obvious, but i\u2019ll tell you, i saw a lot of guys over the years who were always looking for the next ticket to punch or the next good deal or the next job that they had to get to take to make a promotion or whatever", "for me, for the most part, i just took what they gave me and i did the best i could at it", "i\u2019ll tell you, not only did this keep the navy happy, because the navy had a trooper that was just getting after it, it also kept me happy because i wasn\u2019t sweating the promotion or the evaluations or any of the political stuff", "i was just getting after it to the best of my ability", "if you do that, in my opinion, if you do that, your career will take care of itself", "you\u2019ll get the good jobs because people will want you in those good jobs", "the other thing i would say is this: a big piece of being in the military is a gut check", "it\u2019s hard work", "it\u2019s either too hot or too cold", "it\u2019s not enough food", "it\u2019s not enough sleep", "it\u2019s not enough water", "it\u2019s hurry up and wait", "it\u2019s plan for months to do nothing and then don\u2019t plan at all to do something for months", "on top of all that, you throw the politics and the egos and the bureaucracy", "when you mix all that together, it can be pretty miserable, but i will tell you this: all that misery", "relish it", "relish every moment of it because those hard things, those rough things", "those are a part of the experience of the military and it\u2019s experiences like that i promise you will \u2013 for some twisted reason \u2013 you will miss them when you leave", "so don\u2019t hate them", "don\u2019t avoid them", "dive into them and kick them in the ass with a smile on your face", "because another thing is, that smile is contagious", "you\u2019ll elevate the morale of your whole unit when you wear that smile", "so have fun and kick ass at what you\u2019re doing", "for those of you out there on the front lines", "like i said, be aggressive", "the best way to mitigate risk on the battlefield is to be aggressive", "do not be reactive", "step up and get after it", "by the way, to all you active duty folks, thank you for what you\u2019re doing", "for the vets that are listening, thank you for what you did", "next up, i got a question from paul wetkick", "it says, \u201cunfortunately,\u201d this is to tim, i guess", "unfortunately, you, rogan and harris all pussyfooted around him", "i realize he\u2019s probably an intimidating presence, but ask him how he feels about killing people, especially possibly innocents", "don\u2019t let him use \u2018doing my job, bad guys, collateral damage\u2019 narratives", "ask him how he feels about it", "he\u2019s intelligent enough to cope with being pressed for an authentic answer", "so paul wants to know about killing people and possibly killing innocent people and how i feel about that", "so first of all, the nature of war is death", "the nature of war is killing", "that is what war is", "of course, there\u2019s all kinds of other components to war", "there\u2019s economic and cultural and diplomatic and strategic", "but at its fundamental core, war is about death and war is about killing", "in the question here, i\u2019m told i\u2019m not allowed to use the narrative of doing my job, but there\u2019s a reason why that narrative exists", "because death and killing actually is the job of a soldier", "we train for that job", "when the time comes, we do our job and we are good with it", "now, part of that comes from the training", "part of that also comes from the dehumanization of the enemy", "yes, that is a true statement", "the enemy becomes dehumanized to the soldier", "that\u2019s one of the reasons why soldiers are generally okay with it", "in the past, the military had to help that process along", "they had to help the soldier dehumanize the enemy", "it still does do that to some extent, but i think in the wars that we are in now, we don\u2019t need any help dehumanizing the enemy", "the enemy dehumanizes himself", "you see, we in the military, we witness what they do", "we see what they do", "we see the results of the torture and the rape and the murder", "we see families beheaded", "we see people skinned alive", "we see young people, kids \u2013 kids forced to carry out suicide bombings", "and now with the internet in action, the whole world can see the completely despicable and brutal behavior of these sub-human savages burning people alive, throwing people from buildings, drowning people in cages, 10-year-old sex slaves", "it\u2019s absolutely disgusting and abhorrent", "i will tell you that i have no problem whatsoever killing all these vile creatures, all of them", "now, you also ask about killing innocents, killing innocent people", "as i already stated, the nature of war is death", "in war, innocent people sometimes are killed", "you want to know how i feel about it", "well, it is horrible", "it is horrible", "it is awful when it does occur", "and yes, it does occur", "let me tell you that america goes through great lengths, extreme lengths and in doing so, incurs incredible risk to prevent killing innocent people on the battlefield", "when i fought with the 11ad in the battle of ramadi in 2006, the entire strategy, the entire strategy was developed to minimize not only the killing of innocent people, but also to minimize the amount of infrastructure that was destroyed", "so the buildings and the power and the water, all of that", "again, american troops took incredible risks, incredible risks to mitigate the risk to civilians", "but war is messy", "war is confusing", "war is imperfect", "war is hell", "despite all the efforts that we make, despite all the good intentions and the precautions and the planning, sometimes innocent people are killed and it\u2019s horrible", "it\u2019s horrible for the family of the slain and it\u2019s horrible for the military man that pulled the trigger or dropped the bomb or threw the grenade", "it\u2019s horrible for the mission because in places like iraq and afghanistan, we are there to protect the local populace so it takes us backward strategically as we try to win the hearts and minds of the people", "but you know what", "it doesn\u2019t defeat us", "it doesn\u2019t beat us", "and it doesn\u2019t even turn the local populace against us", "i\u2019m speaking now from my experience in the battle of ramadi", "let it be perfectly clear that the local population in ramadi absolutely wanted us there", "they wanted us on the ground in their neighborhoods", "they wanted us to help them get rid of the insurgents that were terrorizing them, literally terrorizing them", "when innocent people were killed for whatever reason, we apologized", "we did what we could to help and we met and we broke bread and we explained what had gone wrong and we asked what we could do to help", "we paid them money and we helped them repair their buildings", "we did whatever we could", "i will tell you, and this never gets represented in the press, but most of the time the local populace, they understood", "they understood it was a war", "they understood it was a war against evil and they understood that meant violence", "they understood that in our efforts to help them get rid of the cancer that ravaged their city, well they understood that there would be bloodshed in removing that cancer", "war is hell", "it is best to be avoided at all costs so that innocent lives are not lost", "but sometimes war cannot be avoided and sometimes war should not be avoided", "sometimes in order to protect the innocents, war is the only choice", "i am thankful that there are men and women in the military that have the courage and the strength and the moral fortitude to stand up and face evil and to also withstand the awful burden of killing and of death", "now i think this is the last question here", "this question came from andy vassely", "it says: what are the biggest lessons learned from jiu-jitsu that transcend the art of fighting itself and can be applied to being an effective leader", "so i\u2019m a practitioner of jiu-jitsu", "it\u2019s a pretty incredible thing to train", "for those of you that train jiu-jitsu, you know what i\u2019m talking about", "for those of you that don\u2019t train jiu-jitsu, go train jiu-jitsu because there\u2019s so much to be learned from jiu-jitsu about leadership and about life", "for instance, i talked a lot about discipline today", "in jiu-jitsu, you\u2019re going to learn about discipline because it takes discipline to get on the mat day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year", "you won\u2019t always feel like training", "as fun as jiu-jitsu is, there\u2019s going to be days you don\u2019t feel like training, but you have to find the discipline and you have to do it", "so you\u2019re going to learn about discipline in jiu-jitsu", "you\u2019re also going to learn about humility because in jiu-jitsu, you will get humbled", "you will get beat by people that are smaller than you and weaker than you, and they will smash you", "they will literally submit you", "that is humbling and there is no escaping it", "those are very important because like i said, i\u2019ve said this before, is that those are lessons that some traditional martial arts would try and teach you almost as theoretical lessons", "like you must be disciplined", "they\u2019ll tell you that in theory", "but in jiu-jitsu, like i said, without discipline, there\u2019s no progress", "in a traditional martial art, they\u2019ll say you must be humble", "like i said, in jiu-jitsu, you actually get humbled", "so jiu-jitsu teaches you a lot about life", "that\u2019s one of the things that makes it so powerful", "back to the question, what does it teach you about leadership", "it absolutely teaches you some key things about leadership and i\u2019ll give you a couple of the most important elements", "first of all, detachment", "i\u2019ve mentioned this word a couple times today", "in jiu-jitsu, i\u2019ll tell you right now, if you let yourself start to get frustrated or you let yourself start to get angry or just emotional in general, you will start to make bad decisions", "when you start to make bad decisions that is the beginning of the end", "so you have to be able to detach from that emotion, that frustration and you got to focus on doing the right thing at the right time", "it\u2019s absolutely necessary", "that\u2019s the same thing in a combat leadership position or in any leadership situation", "you cannot get caught up in all the chaos and all mayhem", "you can\u2019t let your emotions get hold of you, so you have to be able to detach from that", "you have to be able to step back and breathe and see the full picture of what is happening without the cloud of emotion and all that mayhem obscuring your vision so that you can make good decisions", "jiu-jitsu will teach you to do that", "another piece of jiu-jitsu that transfers directly into leadership is the idea of indirect warfare", "so in jiu-jitsu, the whole premise is to attack the weaknesses of your opponent", "you don\u2019t want to attack their strengths", "just fundamentally, you attack the weak areas of their body, like the joints or the neck", "you\u2019re not attacking the strongest parts of their body", "if you attack where your opponent is strong, so if you have an opponent that\u2019s very good at defending one type of one position or one type of hold, you\u2019re just going to wear yourself out if you\u2019re attacking that", "eventually, you\u2019re going to run out of energy and then they\u2019re going to get the advantage", "so you can\u2019t just attack the strengths", "you have to attack the weak points in jiu-jitsu", "now on top of that, you also have to distract your opponent", "you have to make them defend some area", "so you might maybe attack one area so they put their defenses there, but it\u2019s just a feint", "because what you\u2019re really going to do is you\u2019re going to attack an area where they\u2019re not defending", "you\u2019re going to attack their weak areas", "it\u2019s the same thing with leadership", "the clearest example of where this is directly seen in leadership is when you\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s egos", "so you take a person that has a big, strong ego", "you don\u2019t attack that ego head on", "that will just make that person get ultra-defensive", "if you attack their ego, they\u2019re going to get defensive immediately", "now you\u2019ve built up and you\u2019re going to have an even harder fight", "so what you do is you bypass their ego", "maybe you even massage their ego a little bit so that they let down their guard", "so that they let you into their head a little bit and then tactically and quietly you sneak in and you plant the seeds of what you\u2019re trying to get them to do", "of where you\u2019re trying to lead them", "soon enough, without seeing it, those seeds are going to grow and your idea and your plan and your leadership comes to fruition", "that is indirect warfare", "it\u2019s the same thing in jiu-jitsu, it\u2019s the same thing in business and it\u2019s actually the same thing on the battlefield as well", "we don\u2019t attack enemy strengths unless it cannot be avoided", "so take up that jiu-jitsu", "start training and apply those lessons across the board in your life", "i think that\u2019s it for questions for now", "thanks to everybody for listening and thanks, of course, to mr", "tim ferriss, for having me on", "tim has been, for those of you who don\u2019t know, he\u2019s been a huge supporter since i met him", "i really appreciate, tim, everything you\u2019ve done for me and everything that\u2019s kind of stemmed from that has been awesome", "the interaction from everybody through social media and twitter and facebook and all that and everyone that\u2019s listening and giving me feedback on the podcast that i have and the book that i wrote with my buddy, leif", "it\u2019s just awesome to connect with so many people and it\u2019s awesome to know that there\u2019s so many people that are in the game", "so many people that want to get after it", "just like me, looking to get better, looking to do better, looking to be better", "so thanks to everybody for everything", "like i said, especially thanks to tim for kicking this whole thing off", "so until next time, this is jocko", "out"]}
