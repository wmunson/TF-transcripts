 tim ferriss: i'm fantastic. and we've had such an adventure putting this together and get -   sophia amoruso: i know.  tim ferriss:  - and getting all the tech to work. but i'm stoked to be chatting with you. i've wanted to have a jam session with you for so long. and i know we've met very briefly before. but let's start with some basics for people who may not be familiar with you. and i now your role has changed in the last year or so. but when people ask you, what do you do, how do you answer that now and how did you answer that two years ago?  sophia amoruso: if i don't know them i just say like i have an online fashion business. and i try to leave it at that. it depends on who it is. but i started a company called nasty gal in 2006, as an ebay store selling vintage clothing. and you know, whatever, at - like a lot of entrepreneurs just did everything myself, did that needed to happen, just ran a little ebay store. but it wasn't little for very long. left ebay about a year-and-a-half later and launched nastygal.com, which is now kind of full-on fashion, e-commerce destination. we carry brands, we design our own product and we still sell vintage.    and i guess i'm an author, so there's that too. i wrote a book last year that spent a bunch of time on the best seller list. and it was called girl boss, it's called #girlboss but saying hashtag out loud is kind of weird.   tim ferriss: so i mean, you're a multi-hyphenate, you've done a lot. to put some numbers or stats to it and i'm reading off just the reading that i've done so i'd love for - feel free to correct me. but it sounds like [inaudible] is customers in more than 60 countries. it was the fastest growing retailer in 2012 according to ink magazine. and i guess, at one point at least, it sounds like - and again i'm reading from online so who knows how verified this is - but i guess in 2011, when it - so it was started in 2006 and by 2011, revenues like $24 million or so, marking i guess an 11,000 plus three-year growth rate.   sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: so very impressive stuff.  sophia amoruso: thanks.  tim ferriss: very impressive. i cannot resist asking about some of these bullets before we get into that whole story.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: i apologize in advance. so for those who are wondering how this podcast gets put together, i usually like to not rehearse but send some prompts for guests who are on the show. so one of the sentences that i send out is, can you please send some bullets with a handful of topics and or questions that will lead to actionable tips advice, funny stories, or resource and how-to recommendations. so funny stories, the first -   sophia amoruso: i just went straight for funny stories.  tim ferriss: oh, no, it was awesome. so i'm just going to read the first five and then -   sophia amoruso: oh, no.  tim ferriss:  - we're going to dig into one. so bullet number one, \"i once pooped my pants in high school.\" we're going to come back to that. number two, i have three poodles that are all related. number three - and i'm paraphrasing here - i lived on a street called orange blossom twice in different parts of california. i love karaoke and then the last bullet i'll read is, i'm a big supporter of reality tv because it's cheaper and healthier than weed or alcohol. so people love the embarrassing stories. i woke up this morning for the first time - i just adopted a rescue puppy about six weeks ago, she's five months old.  sophia amoruso: oh, cool. tim ferriss: but i woke up and she's never pooped in the house and woke up and she - she's being crate trained - and looking at the carte, it looked like someone had taken a handful of mud and thrown it into a cuisinart. she somehow managed to diarrhea in every direction, including on the top of the cage. i don't know how this is possible.  sophia amoruso: oh, my god, inside the crate?  tim ferriss: yeah, yeah. unless you're like a cirque du soleil athlete who's had whatever, too much to drink. but in any case, so this is on the mind. now obviously, it's all cleaned up, she's fine, she's chilling, molly's good. but tell me about this high school incident. i have to ask since it was sent over.  sophia amoruso: yeah. oh, my god. well, i was at this guy's house, i was like 16 years old. i was at this guy's house who's like this amazing bassist, he played this thing called a war guitar which is bass - it's like a bass with - i don't know, a ton of strings on it and you - it - you basically just play the front board. and he was just looking like this weird like prague-y musician who i thought was supercool. and he was like, i don't know, maybe he was like 19. i thought that was amazing. and i went to his house, he like lived with his dad. and got there like, i don't know, after like 15 minutes my stomach was just like uh-oh.   i had eaten some pepperoni pizza, i think, like the kind that has cheese that you can almost drink. you know, not like boutique-y la pizza or whatever. it was like gnarly pepperoni pizza, just like mouthfuls of cheese. anyway, i was like, oh, no, i don't want to use this guy's bathroom. i'm not sure what's going on here but i should probably leave. so after like 15 minutes at his house i left. and is started driving down the street. it wasn't like, oh, geez, well, if i find a toilet then i'll be happy about it. it was like uh-oh, i really need a toilet.    and i stopped at this liquor store and walked inside and i was like, \"do you guys have a restroom i can use?\" and they were like, \"no, sorry, it's for employees only.\" at that age, it would've been confusing if i had like lied and said, i was pregnant, i think. i've done that before, once, only once. i'm an awful person. no, and then so i got back in my car and drive - i was in a like 1991 honda civic with little like - like a little like - like a racing steering wheel, it was pretty funny. and i drove down the street and stopped at a gas station and got out and it was like step, step, framp, just like oh, my god. i didn't even make it inside.   and it was just like, you know, when something like that happens to you, you wonder if you're going to spend the rest of your life doing that like uncontrollably. because it's just so - it's so shocking. like it just shouldn't happen. and i just like i had to get back in my car and like finish - like finish. and then i had to drive home and you know, sitting in my -   tim ferriss: oops, sorry, that's my pooch.  sophia amoruso: uh-oh.  tim ferriss: i apologize for that.  sophia amoruso: [inaudible] story.   tim ferriss:  i have a number of friends who swapped these stories - sorry, my dog's freaking out, guys. okay this is like podcast v\u201drit\u201d. are you there?  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: okay, so coming back to the topic at hand. so i have a number of friends who are athletes and have been competitive athletes. and guys take all sorts of disgusting pre-workout products and so on. and these guys trade stories of what they call fouling out. so what happened to you they would call fouling out.   sophia amoruso: oh, my god. well, i'm not alone. my people are out there.  tim ferriss: no, you're not alone. and so i'll trade just a really quick one because i think that most guys who've tried to gain muscle and take in a lot of horrible supplements will somehow identify with this. so i was on my way, driving on my way to sfo driving to the airport. and i had had a bunch of serotine monohydrate, a bunch of coffee and then i think what's called mct oil, which is the ultimate recipe for disaster pants, i now realize in retrospect. but got halfway to the airport and i'm racing to a flight and had the exact experience that you did. like just viciously shat myself. and so i -   sophia amoruso: no, yeah. yeah, it's like throwing up, it come in waves.  tim ferriss: oh, it's worst. it's like throwing up, it's so true. sot then i had to basically like clean myself up with my own boxers and like run into the airport, get through security and -   sophia amoruso: oh, my god.   tim ferriss:  - and then go deal with myself. so for those people out there who've had this experience, you're not alone. and what you said also, like the steps kind of like step, step, bang, it made me think of like san francisco doula, midwifery and whatnot. because they're like oh, when you're trying have a natural birth, if you're doing it at home you can have a pregnant woman like walk on a curb, just like one foot on, one foot off. and that's a one way to like kind of pop the baby out.   sophia amoruso: wow. you know all kinds of stuff.  tim ferriss: well, yeah.  sophia amoruso: the 4-hour baby.  tim ferriss: the 4-hour baby, sounds like a horrible tragedy. but how did the business start? and i think a lot of people, they know you, they know your photograph they've seen the book. they're very familiar with the company, as it exists now. but like what was the moment in which you decided to start selling clothing?  sophia amoruso: yeah. i'd never worked in a clothing store and it wasn't - you know, ebay was definitely not my way into the fashion industry, that was not my intention. i just was kind of flailing. i wanted to be photographer but figuring out how to like schmooze in the art world or talk about my photography and make stuff up about why it was important, all of that stuff just seemed like not right for me and not like people were inviting me to do shows. although i did have a show at adobe books before they went extinct. do you ever go there? tim ferriss: no, this is -   sophia amoruso: aww.  tim ferriss:  - this is here in the bay area?  sophia amoruso: yeah, it was supercool bookstore in san francisco. but i don't know, i was like working at the academy of art university, in downtown san francisco on my -   tim ferriss: how old were you at that point?  sophia amoruso: i was 22.  tim ferriss: okay, got it.  sophia amoruso: and i got that job because i needed to have a hernia fixed. i don't know how i got a hernia but i had no health insurance so i had to get a job so i could get health insurance so i could get my hernia fixed. and i had to work at this job for three months to get health insurance.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  sophia amoruso: so i did. but i was working in the lobby just like checking student ids. and sometimes worked like late at night and was - you know, i had time to kill on the internet. and was getting friend request on myspace. i'm not sure if anyone remembers.   tim ferriss: oh, yes.  sophia amoruso: i'm kidding. and so i was getting friend request on myspace from ebay sellers that were promoting their businesses on myspace. and i wore almost entirely vintage at the time and i knew where to find it. and i saw the prices that these vintage pieces were fetching on ebay and said, hey, you know, i can find them for way cheaper. i know how to take a picture. i'm pretty sure i know how to use the internet. and ebay was a great place to start. you know, there's a kind of like framework for you to sell online. and it's really easy today but then building a website, like a web shop wasn't - you know, it wasn't as easy. so started with ebay and you also have a built-in customer base there.    you put something and you can test like what works or if people like your taste or what you have to bring to the table. so i bought ebay for dummies and had a friend model for free. you know, and just found some vintage, sold some of my stuff. you know, you can get a read on what people like really, really quickly because they watch stuff.  tim ferriss: right.  sophia amoruso: there's something called watching, which is basically like you like monitoring it or adding to your favorites. you want to see what happens with the auction over the course of the week or ten days.  tim ferriss: and how did you know where to find vintage clothing?  sophia amoruso: it was like all i wore. i just spent my youth in thrift stores, like discovering, just unearthing stuff that no one else wanted that i thought was really special. and i made a career out of it.  tim ferriss: did you have a favorite thrift store, at the time, in the bay area?isophia amoruso: let me think\u00e9 at the time, i don't know. none of them are a real like goldmine anymore.  tim ferriss: right.  sophia amoruso: i liked estate sales a lot because you can encounter people who have no idea what they have. that's becoming rare and are. and thrift stores are like onto vintage being valuable.   tim ferriss: at the time, how would you find the estate sales? just look in the newspaper or like at craig's list?   sophia amoruso: yeah, craig's list and the newspaper, yeah.   tim ferriss: very cool.  sophia amoruso: and i'd like line up with all these people that were, i don't know, way older than me at like 6:00 a.m. to be the first people in. and i'd just run straight for the closet and hope whoever died had great style.  tim ferriss: i saw the end, i didn't watch - i didn't see the entire thing, my girlfriend was watching it, the end of this documentary about a - i want to say a fashion icon named iris, who's now or when it was recorded or filmed in her 90s, 93. and she has awesome style but i think it'll be hard to get to her estate sale.  sophia amoruso: uh, yeah.  tim ferriss: so you got ebay for dummies, you know where to find the vintage clothing\u00e9  sophia amoruso: know how to take a picture.  tim ferriss: known how to take a picture. and you're getting an education of what works or what people are at least interested in, right.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: through the watching. do you remember your first sale or your first day of sales?  sophia amoruso: yeah, it was like - well, it was a week of auction so i watched what happened over the course of the week. and at the very end some stuff goes crazy because people swoop in at the last minute trying to steal it from whoever was in the lead. and you know, sometimes nothing happens. but i learned really quickly what - you know, what was working and what wasn't and tweaked that, you know, every - with every auction, with everything i bought. and i watched my competitors and i watched what they were doing. and i just i try to a better job. and i don't know.  tim ferriss: what are some examples of maybe one of the things that you noticed in those initial tests and that you could be better at?  sophia amoruso: yeah. well, the thumbnails are the thing that attract - that i mean, you evaluate everything as you browse ebay by a thumbnail and the tile of the item. and those are two things that you can optimize just into kind of infinity. i mean, there's a limited amount of space but i knew that using image that were really bright where you could see the silhouette of the item - ebay thumbnails have gotten a lot bigger but at the time they were teeny tiny. so making it really obvious what the item was and even showing - you know, i had a - i would split the image in half and have, you know, half of the thumbnail be a full - like full-length shot of the item and then i'd have like a detailed shot like on the - maybe the right-hand side and the description.   so i mean, selling vintage is such an incredible way to learn perceived value because unless you're selling something that's like a designer like chanel jacket or whatever you're buying stuff that - you're buying it for the style and you're buying the things that have no inherent value that could be - that are - really are someone else's throw-away. and exalting them a level that makes them worth more. and worth more, i mean, ebay, it was the customer who determined the price. they started everything at $9.99 and let them choose or let them fight over it.    but they only fought over it because i turned it into something really special. and i breathed new life into these forgotten about things.   tim ferriss: as a copywriter, how did you accomplish that? and maybe that's a non-specific question that's unhelpful. i'm just -   sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: for instance, i mean, a lot of people bring up i think it's influence by robert cialdini and they talk about say, you know, scarcity, time, restrictions, etc., as tools of persuasion that can be used for good or ill means. how did you learn to write persuasive copy?  sophia amoruso: i don't know. my mom was writer and reading and writing was always - i mean, it sounds like so basic but it was just something that she always took a lot of pride in and just something that i really cared about. and i guess i had a voice. i didn't realize that until later on when i - you know, when i realized i was building a brand because there was so many specific things that had become part of the nasty gal dna. but you can have something that may be like an 80s like big-ass, you know, coat, cape-y thing that some overweight lady might have bought and turn it into like this like avant-garde - i mean, you can use a word like avant-garde for something that could be perceived as like outdate and funky on the wrong person.  like a lady with a perm or just like the coolest thing on some like kid with a weird haircut, you know, on the sidewalk. so it's all about context.  tim ferriss: right.  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: so couple of things. the first is thumbnails. we are doing this over skype. for those people who always ask me, i'm using e-camm call recorder to record this and audio technical atr 2100 mic, which is about $60 at amazon. but your thumbnail, for skype is this rad looking chick. i don't know who she is. it's a bunch of bikers, naked female bikers.   sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: and one of them has - it looks like tattoo of flowers and something over one breast and she's holding a knife? i can't tell exactly what's going on.  sophia amoruso: yeah, that's pretty accurate.  tim ferriss: where is this from? or how did you - what is this?  sophia amoruso: so i'm working on my second book. and i've been like pulling images, just all kinds of inspirations. some of it will be used in the book and this is actually an image from a movie called girl boss, girl boss guerrilla.   tim ferriss: guerilla g-u-e-r-r -isophia amoruso: g-e-u, yeah.  tim ferriss: got it.  sophia amoruso: yeah, so that was a film that i saw a long time ago that was kind of the inspiration for the name of girl boss. and very few people know that.  tim ferriss: ah.  sophia amoruso: uh-huh. so there's a whole genre of japanese like cinema called pinky violence or just pinky films. and it's pretty much like all female revenge and like girl gangs. and they're so cool, like they're super stylish and tarantino's ripped a lot from them.  tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: and this one, this is from girl boss guerrilla.  tim ferriss: ah, i wonder if, i think, battle royale i want to say is one of those comic books, one of the most violent -   sophia amoruso: mm-hmm, i've seen it.   tim ferriss:  - violent things you could possibly imagine, which makes you the think of some of, say, the fight scenes in like kill bill, in some capacity. but coming back to the writing for a second, let me start with a question that i always ask and we'll go from there. what is the book that you've gifted most to other people?  sophia amoruso: so the book that i've gifted most to other people is the richest man in babylon, which i talk about in girl boss. and it was written like 100 years ago and it's written as though it was written in biblical times or something.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  sophia amoruso: parables.  tim ferriss: oh, yeah. yeah, it's parable or, yeah. it would be a parable; it'd be like the alchemist.  sophia amoruso: yeah, it's basically parable set in ancient times, describing someone who goes about - this guy who goes about, i forget his name, trying to find out how he can make money, how he can make a life for himself and his family. and he encounters all these different people and lessons along the way. and the advice is, you know, very - there's some really simple advice like save ten percent of everything that you earn. don't take advice from the baker if you want to be a cobbler, you know.   tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: and it's something that anyone can read and understand. it's like a one hour or two hour read, it's the tiniest little book. and 100years later all the advice still holds u, which i find really great. and it's like a - it's a cheap book and i'm a cheap giver, so. i'm kidding. i'm kidding. so it would be that. it would be that and my book, i guess.  tim ferriss: the richest man in babylon. and what other writers, just from a writing perspective - so you said your mother was a writer or your father?  sophia amoruso: my mom.  tim ferriss: what type of writing did she do?  sophia amoruso: well, she sold houses for a long time and then kind of quit doing that and then started writing about real estate. and now she writes about all kinds of stuff and she's working on her own book. yeah, wait, so what was the question?  tim ferriss: i was stuttering and stammering my way to the questions, which was what - do you have any favorite writers or writers that you admire or have influenced you? any of the above.  sophia amoruso: yeah, so rainer maria roka, i think, is just such a - like just great.  tim ferriss: can you say that one more time, please?  sophia amoruso: i think it's rainer maria roka?  tim ferriss: oh, yeah. yeah, yeah.  sophia amoruso: yeah. what's it called, on love and other - or maybe it's just on love. i don't know. almost like everything that i learned from actually reading things or [inaudible] culture happened before i started the business. basically since i was 22, so it's been almost a decade. i feel like my personal, i don't know, my quest for knowledge was fulfilled by all the shit, all the challenges that come with building a business. and things like books that i read of fun and not books that i read to learn stuff kind of went out the door.  tim ferriss: right.  sophia amoruso: it's like all non-fiction and -   tim ferriss: the discretionary extracurriculars kind of got consumed or displaced by the work.  sophia amoruso: kind of, yeah. it's like i only read things that i can do something practical with now. just i don't know. not something that makes for a lot of relaxation but fun.  tim ferriss: so rainer maria roka, i that's - i'm sure i'm pronouncing that incorrectly but he's come up actually in my life in the last 48 hours. i've had two separate people recommend reading. and i did read this a long, long time ago but letters to a young poet.  sophia amoruso: yeah!  tim ferriss: which was from 1929. so what do you do? you said it's not relaxing - and i know we're hopping around a lot - but what do you do to relax? let's just say, looking back at some of the either rougher periods or fastest growing periods in your company, what did you do to decompress? i mean, when you felt overwhelmed or burned out, what did you do? how did you manage that?  sophia amoruso: god. sometimes you just kind of explode and hopefully no one else is around. i mean, i was like crying last night. also -   tim ferriss: why were you crying last night? i can't let that go.  sophia amoruso: oh, my god. i don't know, just because running a business is really hard. um, i mean i -   tim ferriss: yeah, what do you do? i mean, do you cry or like five minutes and you're done? do you cry for longer than that?  sophia amoruso: yeah, i cried for like five minutes and then i was done. just kind of like this feels good so i'm going to just let it happen for a second.  tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: yeah. just like, fuck, it was just one of those - it was a long day. yeah. but right now, the thing that relaxes me the most is tuning in and turning off with reality tv. i don't know, i just finished watching an entire season of the worst show. people are not even compelling; they're like not funny. it's so bad but it - you can't stop watching. it's called dating naked.  tim ferriss: dating naked. oh, my god, i've seen - i remember i saw a few minutes of this in like a waiting room at a doctor or something. and i was like that is the most ridiculous premise i've ever seen. but i couldn't stop watching it.  sophia amoruso: it's so dumb. it's so dumb but i can't - you can't stop watching it. you're like, ew, their butts. and you're like but i like watching this show. i don't know. yeah, what else do i do to relax? hang out with my dogs. uh, they're cool.  tim ferriss: these are the three poodles that are related?  sophia amoruso: they are all siblings, yeah. they're different ages, they're like from different litters. but their parents like - yeah, they're parents have been busy.  tim ferriss: what are their names?  sophia amoruso: donna summer is the oldest one and she's like three. and the next one's cozy dozer and cozy's like, i don't know, maybe just over a year old. and then there's one named gino who was named after my husband's grandfather. and he's like, i don't know, maybe eight months or something.  tim ferriss: so that's gino. i want to talk about naming because naming and titling is really - i've enjoyed reading about how you've gone about it in a few cases. so the girl boss guerrilla, i had no idea. so that's new. and i need to get that made into a poster in my house because it's amazing.  sophia amoruso: you should.  tim ferriss: second, so gino's after the grandfather. what about the two other dogs, how did you come up with those names or how were they named?  sophia amoruso: i don't know, donna was just like - well, it was kind of like can we name her donna bummer and then it was like but that's not very nice. okay, let's name her donna summer. i don't know. i don't know why.tim ferriss: so -   sophia amoruso: she has a cool haircut. and then cozy was just like super sleepy. and you know, when we brought donna home she was like screaming her head off, just like don't take me away from my parents. and we were like, oh, no, were awful. and then we brought cozy home and cozy just like kind of slept. and it was just like i'm cool and she's still like that. so it was just like let's name her cozy dozer.  tim ferriss: cozy dozer. now nasty gal.   sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: a lot of folks don't know the origin where is the name from?  sophia amoruso: so the name nasty gal, so i used to work at a record store in san francisco that's no longer around, in noe valley called street light records. and spent a lot of time. i think music was probably like my first love way before fashion. i'm not even sure if i'm in love with fashion. i'm not sure if it was just reissued at that time but i somehow uncovered this album called nasty gal by a woman named betty davis, who i think is becoming - become more well-known. but she's the ex-wife of miles davis and she's this just like super-outspoken funk singer with a really great band behind her.   and just a super raunchy like awesome lyrics. and she just doesn't give a fuck. so when i was choosing a name for my ebay store, which i never thought i'd be - you know, i never thought i'd be talking about it this much, you know, nine years later. which is fine, i still like the name. i thought nasty gal would be good because there was so may other ebay sellers whose business names were like ladies standing in the dust or like, you know, like lady in tall grass or like boho. just like so like bohemian and kind of like expected. and i was like i'm going to name it nasty gal i don't know, i'm just like - i'm antagonistic, so. i don't know, it worked.   tim ferriss: looking back at nasty gal, i guess a couple of questions. one is, so i've read in different places - well, different accounts of this, why leave ebay?   sophia amoruso: one second, did i actually say that she has an album called nasty gal because i think i didn't? because i think i just talked about this lady named betty davis.itim ferriss: ah, all right. well, that's helpful to have that tidbit then.  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: so the album name is nasty gal, hence?  sophia amoruso: yes.  tim ferriss: bang, okay.  sophia amoruso: yes.  tim ferriss: cool. the transition off of ebay, how did that happen? what's the story behind that?  sophia amoruso: well, it wasn't much of a transition. you know, i like to make promises that i'm not sure i can keep and then figure out how to keep them. it's happened a few times in my life.   tim ferriss: we will come back to that.  sophia amoruso: yeah. it's good. i think you can like will things into happening by just like committing to them sometimes. i had started to promote the idea of this, you know, coming soon nastygal.com, nastygalvintage.com was actually the first url. i had to buy nastygal.com from you can guess who. but i had started to leave feedback for my customers when -   tim ferriss: wait a second. okay, i actually can't guess, i'm like betty davis, i can't imagine that's the [inaudible].  sophia amoruso: oh.  tim ferriss: no. who did you have to buy it from? was it some porn company?  sophia amoruso: yeah. yes! yes.  tim ferriss: okay, all right. got it. did you do that through a broker? did you reach out to them directly or how did?  sophia amoruso:  i did it through a broker.  tim ferriss: got it. and where doe someone find such a broker to help them if they want to do that?sophia amoruso: i don't remember, someone introduced me to this guy and it was like - it was $8,000.  tim ferriss: nice, that's good investment right there.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: so sorry to interrupt but i had to - my head was spinning with all these incorrect answers. so you get the domain, you've put up coming soon.  sophia amoruso: put up the domain, yeah, coming soon, you know, nastygalvintage. and i had started to leave feedback for my customers on ebay saying like, \"hey, coming soon, nastygalvintage.com\". and it was like oh, shit, i better build a website, i better actually do this. so i figured out, i launched the website and when i launched the website ebay decided to suspend me around the same time. so it was not a transition it was literally like i'm going to try this website thing, i hope i can go back to ebay if it doesn't work out. it became apparent pretty quickly that that wasn't going to be an option. i got suspended for leaving a url in the feedback for the customers.   tim ferriss: ah.  sophia amoruso: ebay doesn't want to send - they don't want you sending traffic off their website.  tim ferriss: yeah, ixnay on the stealing our customersay, from their web -   sophia amoruso: ixnay on the ebay.    tim ferriss: right, exactly. so what the hell did you do? i mean, if suddenly bam, that entire ecosystem's turned off, what happened in the next kind of like 24, 48 hours?  sophia amoruso: well, some people, some editors had heard or seen on the myspace profile that i was going to launch a website. and they did a little coverage of it when it launched. and it launched, it was just kind of like there was a lot of pent up demand. i didn't know i would have any traffic but the website sold pout just instantly. it was like an hour and there were maybe 150 items on the website then we launched. but there's only one of each of those things, they're just one of ki - you just - 150 orders still seem like a lot for your first day of doing business.  tim ferriss: that's a lot.  sophia amoruso: and it was just like i had like kelly ripa's stylist calling me asking if i had another one of those like extra - that was a like vintage jacket in extra small. it's like no, it's one of a kind. and i don't know, it was very serendipitous that it worked at all and that, you know, i was able to not have to go back to ebay, if that is even a sentence.  tim ferriss: no, i think we can work with that punctuation in this conversation. yeah, especially since i've had enough tea now and butter and coconut oil to last me for like a siberian trek but i'm digressing. the bay transition/booting off of/jumping head first and growing wings on the way down, that was how long after you started selling on ebay?  sophia amoruso: that was, oh, gosh, a year-and-a-half.  tim ferriss: and at the point that you launched your site, what did sales look like on ebay for you, if you recall, roughly?  sophia amoruso: yeah. so the first year on ebay was like $7,000 in revenue. which you know, i wasn't paying myself, i mean, i didn't need stuff, i lived in a pool house for $500 a month. like i drove a '87 volvo, like i didn't - i ate boston market and subway, you know, like all the time. that was like winning the lottery.  tim ferriss: yeah. oh, for sure. i think boston market's underrated. i used to -   sophia amoruso: it kind of is.  tim ferriss: it's like trader joe's and boston market's, like don't knock it until you try it.  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: and then you start getting inquiries from kelly ripa's stylist. she is extra small, having been on that show once, she in tiny.  sophia amoruso:  i know. she's in such great shape.   tim ferriss: she is in amazing shape.  sophia amoruso: yeah.tim ferriss: how did you develop those relationships with editors and so on or was it all out of the blue? i mean, did you ping them in the preceding years?  sophia amoruso: no, it was like totally inbound at that point. and it wasn't like a giant - you know, there wasn't a ton of news everywhere. it was daily candy, you know, rest in peace. and who, what, where. and they just kind of - they followed me on myspace, they heard about the launch and they decided to talk about it. and the kind of coverage i got was stuff that brands like [inaudible] will pay, you know, tens of thousands of dollars, you know, for. but then you're doing something cool people want to talk about it. and i guess it was cool. i mean, i hate saying that i'm cool. but -   tim ferriss: no, you can say it was cool because if you were like, let me tell you how i'm cool, it would be one thing. but you're talking about how the launch was cool, that's fair game.  sophia amoruso: people liked it. they liked it so they talked about it. if you have something great people will talk about it. i think that's just kind of a rule of the internet.   tim ferriss: and if someone were launching now, not necessarily fashion or anything like that. but they say, i have this idea for x, let's just - let's - we can think something up like vintage toy cars, let's just say, okay.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: and i'm sure it's been done. but and they say, you know, i would like to figure out - i would like to build a business based on this, what advice would you give them in terms of kind of testing or de-risking or testing the water in any way? or you can answer that in any way really that you lie. but if you had that conversation with sooner and i'm sure you have had probably had ad nauseam these types of conversations. but assuming they're pretty smart, they're willing to do the work, they're detail oriented, what would you say to them?  sophia amoruso: i would say it's really great to test your product. my mo is like i'm going to talk about something before i've even launched it and make a big stink about the thing. you know, who knows if it's going to work out. and that's just me being kind of like short attention span, instant gratification. but i really think there's a lot of value in being patient, i testing things with like a small group before you go out there and tell the world tada, you know, here i am fully formed. you know, buy into my sto - you know, buy into what i'm doing. i think there's just a lot of resources for - i mean, as far as selling online goes its - i mean, it's like having a lemonade stand at this point.    so it's incredibly easy thing to do. your product should be really differentiated in the way you talk about it. it should be unique and really thoughtful and regardless of whether you're selling, you know, used diapers or used toy cars - sorry - you should really, really invest in presenting yourself well. and there's websites like squarespace, obviously, that make that so easy now, so much easier than it used to be. just finding a graphic designer that could make something look like what you can plug into now for almost no money is incredible.   tim ferriss: yeah. now the infrastructure, i mean, the rentable infrastructure per se, whether it's a squarespace or a wordpress or someone else, i mean, you can have a site up and running within an hour or two. and then you could use - you know, i've mentioned them in the 4-hour workweek but even the marketplaces that exist now for things like designers, right, or illustrators. like a 99designs or fiverr or something like that. i mean, i'm having illustrations done for a book right now with the non-spec version of 99designs, these kind of one-on-one projects. and the quality is obscenely high. i mean, i've been very, very impressed.    so it is a lot easier and particularly with things like kickstarter. i think you have also the ability to see how strong your pitch is, right, before you buy inventory or manufacture things.  sophia amoruso: yeah. yeah, no one cares you don't have a customer. it's like you've got to see if anyone cares first.  tim ferriss: exactly. and if they're willing to part ways with their dollars. what were some books or resources that helped you in the first few years or overall, in building nasty gal?  sophia amoruso: totally. i would say the dummies guides are not - they're fine. they're really fine. when i went to raise venture capital there's one called - i think it's something like how to be smarter than your venture capitalist. like literally something like that and i liked that. and i was like, you know, i've raised $70 million so i guess i figured that out. and there was a book called no man's land that i thought was really good. it was about just that period of time where you're too small to be big and you're too big to be small. and most people hire middle management but middle management have never seen the top.    so then you hire more senior management. and i've done that and even that's challenging. so i mean, there's no silver bullet but reading other people - reading about other peoples' experiences of growing and struggling with scaling a business always makes you feel better.   tim ferriss: is the book that you were thinking of venture deals: be smarter than your lawyer and venture capitalist?  sophia amoruso: no. maybe it's called like how to outsmart your venture capitalist or something.  tim ferriss: how to train your venture capitalist?  sophia amoruso: yeah, basically. ho to be smarter than your venture capitalists. at least that's what's coming up in the search results. let me see.  tim ferriss: how to be smarter than your venture capitals. sophia amoruso: venture deals: be smarter than your lawyer - i guess that's it yeah.  tim ferriss: okay. all right, cool. yeah, that venture deals for people interested in this world is a great book. that's brad feld his partner, very, very good investors. what were some of the biggest challenges for scaling an e-commerce business? what were some of things that you guys - that you had to contend with? let's just keep it focused on you but the company, of course, as it's growing. and i've spoken with people like phil [inaudible] on the podcast and he's like, \"well\u00e9\" like this, you know, gent who runs rock utan, he's saying you should always plan online what if it's three times bigger, what if its ten times bigger.    there are sort of these phase shifts where systems have to be completely redone. but for you, in growing the company, what were some of the hardest periods for you?  sophia amoruso: yeah. i would say scaling is really hard. so i would say infrastructure, so systems. i mean, we still don't have the systems that we would like to have to be able to plan our business and evaluate our business and talk about it.  tim ferriss: what would be some examples of systems?sophia amoruso: like i mean, it's really kind of like unglamorous stuff. like an erp system, like enterprise resource planning, which basically connects the dots between, you know, different departments like finance and you know, merchandise and whatever else. and right now everything that we do is living in kind of disparate systems that don't talk as much as they could.   tim ferriss: right.  sophia amoruso: so that's a struggle today. what else? i mean, i would say people. i would say like, you know, being - having never really been a manager prior to starting the business that is nasty gal, you know, my dream scenario at one point was - you know, was not getting out of a bathrobe and eating boston market like, you know, with my hands. and yeah. and then encountering, you know, hundreds of - you know, a team of hundreds who are looking up at you. it's like a really scary thing. and they all assume that you -   tim ferriss: i thought you eat your dream was walking into the office of hundreds of people in your bathrobe. and i was like that's very wolf of wall street.   sophia amoruso: oh, wow.  tim ferriss: i kind of like that visual, like eating lobster tails while you walk through the office.   sophia amoruso: i would do that but i haven't. should i start over or because i didn't make sense?  tim ferriss: no. no, no, no.   sophia amoruso: okay.  tim ferriss: no. it does make sense. i mean, how - what did you view your - now you are no longer ceo, is that correct?   sophia amoruso: no. yes, correct.   tim ferriss: when you were ceo, what did you view as your job?   sophia amoruso: as entrepreneur ceo it's really tough because there's so many things that i've been a part of and done over the course of the company's history. and i'm also kind of the brand cop. the brand is my voice. the vision is kind of growing out of the beginnings, the dna of what was nasty gal origin story. so there's never been a point where i could just be like the cut and dry, i'm the ceo kind of person. you know, i'm the cultural leader, i'm the - all of these things. it was so many things. so you know, when you're growing a business, it's really hard to say, no, i'm going to plug that hole, i'm not going to edit the photos i'm not going to - you know, companies spring leaks and when you have - when you've done so many different things it's easy to sprout arms and fingers and just start like, you know, overextending yourself by filling in the gaps as they present themselves over the course of, you know.    i don't think i got to choose my - what i did as much as i perhaps would've liked to. even today, i'm not sure if i have that privilege because you kind of have to do what the company needs you to do for it to continue operating or to be - it's very vast. and nine years of that is a really long time. and i think my greatest strengths are with the brand and with marketing the brand and with the creative and the things that in the beginning built nasty gal. and that's what i'm hoping i can focus on today.  tim ferriss: how do you try to keep the team on the same page so that that sort of brand aesthetic and spirit doesn't get fragmented and turned into some frankenstein monster where you've become brands that you loathe or whatever? you get the idea.  sophia amoruso: totally. yeah.  tim ferriss: how do you try to steer that?  sophia amoruso: you can really quickly become a caricature of yourself. like yeah, like a spoof of like what you've done best. and i think it's a matter of talent but it's also coaching. but at the end of the day, i think, you really need to have tools that everyone can rally around and say, hey, this is what it is. this is what the brand is, this is what we're all signing up to do. not this is my idea versus your idea versus your idea. because i think culture, like in a business that people really excited - are excited to work at, culture can be used as a weapon.    i think the brand can be used as a weapon. you know, there have been times where people who are really cool and actually do get what the brand is find themselves really frustrated because not everybody gets it the way they do. and they start to say, well, sophia said this or sophia wouldn't like that. and it's like i don't want to be - don't sling me around, like that's not cool. and so we've been spending the last several months actually working on somewhat of a brand bible but also just filters for how we make decisions about what the voice is how we take pictures. and you know, the world that is the nasty gal world and what the - you know, what the guardrails are that people can explore within.   we always want to leave room for people to be creative. but it takes out the objectivity - or wait, yeah the ob - the subjectivity? oh, my god my brains not working. basically it makes it not personal.   tim ferriss: yeah, yeah. make sit more objective or de-personalized.  sophia amoruso: yeah, so it's easy for it to be like, oh, well, that's not on brand because i said so. it's like oh, hey, we're all trying to do the same thing. let's look at this thing that sits outside of us, our taste, our ego, whatever, let's talk about what it is rather than what we think it is. so you have to have those things defined for people to have conversations about. and that's something i'm really excited to have.   tim ferriss: there's a really cool handbook, i think it's just called the handbook for new employees, for a company called valve which is a software company. it's one of the coolest sort of employee orientation handbooks that i've ever seen. i had a chance to meet - because it was gabe newell at one point in seattle. somebody else then recommended i see this handbook. it's really cool, you should check it out. i think you might enjoy and people listening might get something out of it. you can find the free pdf if you just search valve employee handbook. it's pretty sweet.  sophia amoruso: i think i've seen that. it's really beautiful and it's this teeny little cool thing.  tim ferriss: yeah. yeah, it's really well done, great illustrations but lays out the basic ground rules, right, for working within this somewhat unusual culture.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: now you mentioned the - before i derailed us with the wolf of wall street analogy and you walking around in a bathrobe eating lobster tails, which actually i have a quick anecdote. so when i was in college, one of my buddies - and i was in new jersey - and one of my buddie sends up calling us from atlantic city. and he's like, \"there are limos coming to get you. you have to come to atlantic city.\" we show up and he's just been on a bender and made like $200,000 blackjack and proceeds to spend it all in the next 48 hours. and he was walking around the casino in a bathrobe eating and he ordered lobster tails for everyone on the like blackjack floor.  sophia amoruso: wow.  tim ferriss: and so i was kind of imaging like you could be that person but with like a martini glass. sophia amoruso: i love absurd - just doing absurd things like that because you can. like that's -   tim ferriss: so i was going to ask you about managing and i will but absurd things. what are some absurd things that you've done?  sophia amoruso: oh, my gosh. i'm getting on a bus that i'm calling a girl bus, #girlbus. and well, it's like later at the end of this month and we're - it's just the paperback, it's the girl boss paperback and it has a new introduction. and in the introduction to the introduction, i guess, just talking about what's happened over the last year a little it. and we're going not like ten different cities on this crazy tour bus, it's like i'm a spice girl or something. and you know, throwing events at different venues and some bookstores. and it's just like it's really absurd to be riding around like hillary clinton in like a campaign bus basically.   but penguin wanted to do it and i thought it was just like too good to pass up. and it's really funny to have your face and the cover of your book like - you know, slathered across the side of like a giant tour bus.  tim ferriss: i would imagine. what about managing, let's talk about that. so the managing of people, you had no experience prior to nasty gal. now it's grown, of course, tremendously. who were the mentors or what were the things that helped you learn to manage to the extent that you were able?  sophia amoruso: oh, my god. i think i'm still learning. wait, say that again?  tim ferriss: yeah, that was a word salad question.  sophia amoruso: okay.  tim ferriss: who are the mentors or like the resources that helped you learn to manage other people? because i think that's a weakness of mine, quite frankly. i'm good at defining systems but i'm not always - for instance, i mean, i was raised by - or not raised by, sounds weird - i was coached by a lot of athletic coaches who were always kind of very short with praise. they would not, they didn't do a lot of head pats.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: but heavy on criticism and very -   sophia amoruso: same.  tim ferriss:  - meticulous. and so i am often very bad at providing praise when i probably should. because i don't feel like i was ever given it, therefore it's not really necessary.  sophia amoruso: totally, yeah.  tim ferriss: but -   sophia amoruso: i'm the same. i think i'm the same.  tim ferriss: but that causes all sorts of problems, right.  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: at least in my experience.  sophia amoruso: people are like; we don't feel appreciated. and it's like, oh, my god, i totally appreciate you. but like i respect your intelligence enough not to like be like, i don't know. it's just -   tim ferriss: yeah, it's tough. i mean, because i've always been told like what the good cuff - the good stuff. i remember i had a vp of sales at one point, was my first job out of college. you know, i would give him all the story and the backstory, tell him all this stuff about every client and he's like, \"tim, i don't need the story, i just need to know next steps. and second, i don't need to know the good news because that takes care of itself. i need to know the bad news.\" and i was like, \"oh, okay.\" and so i've kind of adopted that but you end up in position where people can get very demoralized in a culture where people aren't getting - or don't have the ability to celebrate little wins and so on. who has helped you to become a better ceo when you were a ceo or a better manager?sophia amoruso: i've had some executive coaches along the way. i think knowing the difference and then actually living the difference are two different things. and i think i'm pretty aware of the things that i'm - what my shortcomings are as a manager, as a leader, as a fill in the blank. you know, i think i've experienced the same thing where when you - especially if you're entrepreneurial, which i think we can both safely say we are, no one's giving you those pats on the back. and when you find yourself in a position to be doling those out, you don't really relate because that's not something that you ever required.   i'm an only child, i had a really mean dad and he's [inaudible] now. but like it was criticism after criticism and it makes you self-aware enough to calibrate on your own in a lot of ways. even though i'm totally open to - i love you know, criticism and i love - but i think when you're like a solo act at any point in your life then have to manifest things without the team, without the amazing team that we have today, you become really good at being your own critic and your own-and also your own pat on the back. or you're motivated maybe by different things. and that's a hard thing to relate to as an entrepreneur who's leading people.    and i think that's definitely been one of my shortcomings. but i'm always seeking advice and i'm always seeking to better myself. i think leadership, management, jobs, whatever you want to call it, it's something that comes over time. a lot of things are just learned over time with repetition and that's something that i have - you know, i've been - that's one part of the job that i've had, is managing people, leading people. but there's been a million other things that i've done over the course of, you know, nasty gal's trajectory.   and having someone like sheri, our ceo, who had a lifetime of those jobs behind her, who wakes up every day inspired. not just inspired to lead people but knows how to do it in a way that will work, is such a real - it's such a cool thing to witness.   tim ferriss: when you were in the ceo role, who were the other ceos about there, alive or dead that you admired and really looked to as role models?  sophia amoruso: good question. i mean, i've always admired natalie massenet who founded net-a-porter. she hasn't been the ceo or a long time but she's just like an incredible woman.   tim ferriss: why is she incredible? sophia amoruso: she's a mother of two. she started a company a long - you know, she started an e-commerce business long before most of us had the idea to. you know, i mean, i think people like kind of scoffed when, you know, she said, \"i'm going to sell a $30,000 handbag on the internet.\" or sell shoes on the internet or these things that have become really commonplace. and she's also just a super duper down-to-earth woman who's funny and sweet and gives great advice and who has seen a lot. and there's not a ton of examples that i think are similar to hers. mickey drexler's also an incredible like ceo.   tim ferriss: mickey drexler?  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  sophia amoruso: do you know who mickey drexler is?  tim ferriss: i don't. i'm embarrassed to say.  sophia amoruso: oh, my god!  tim ferriss: but i shan't tell a lie. i don't.  sophia amoruso: okay. he's the ceo at j. crew right now and he used to be the ceo at gap. and he's kind of like a retail legend. i think he's called like the merchant prince or merchant king or something like that.   tim ferriss: that's a cool nickname.  sophia amoruso: i know, right. i know. he's someone who's given me advice along the way, just really great advice and connected me to people that i've ended up - you know, great people beget great people. and you know, it's just when you meet someone awesome you - it's oft - it's common that i find the people that they surround themselves with are people that i also like. it's just such a cool thing. and i know it's like you don't have to - it's like going to a - never mind.   tim ferriss: wait. wait, wait. no, no, no, i want you to finish that thought, that was about to get interesting.  sophia amoruso: i was going to start babbling like about yelp reviews. and it's like a yelp review for a person. it's just like it wasn't - it was to an intelligent thought so i gave up.  tim ferriss: you know; i should learn to do that more often. i would embarrass myself a lot less. what was some of the advice that mickey has given you that has stick with you?  sophia amoruso: uh\u00e9  tim ferriss: doesn't have to be specifically business, could be anything.  sophia amoruso: i mean, his advice was to stay ceo, which is really funny. it's definitely stuck with me but i ignored it. let me think\u00e9  tim ferriss: i can give you an escape hatch for this.  sophia amoruso: my memory blows. i mean, it blows.  tim ferriss: i can give you a whole slew of pills and potions for that. but we will do that separately. have you met david cho?  sophia amoruso: no.  tim ferriss: you haven't. okay, somebody asked online what you learned from him. that was very -   sophia amoruso: what?  tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: david cho?  tim ferriss: yeah, the graffiti artists/artist who ended up, i guess worth $500 million after facebook. i believe i'm saying his last name.  sophia amoruso: oh, cool. what did i learn from him? no, i - that's cool.   tim ferriss: but you haven't met him?  sophia amoruso: what i learned about him was everything that you just told me, that's what i -   tim ferriss: okay. okay, got it. i've been hoping to - i find his story fascinating so i'm hoping to connect with him at some point.  sophia amoruso: that's pretty cool.tim ferriss: yeah, he's just made some really fascinating creative decisions that i'd love to dig into. but anyway, that's a whole separate story. what do you struggle with the most and how do you deal with it?  sophia amoruso: i struggle with doing it all the most. i struggle with feeling like i don't have time for everyone who i want to have time for and who i assume wants my time. for my friends and for my husband and for my parents and for my team, it's just time is a really a finite thing. and prioritizing it so that you can - you know, so you can be your best so that you can, you know, have real solid time with people so you can also find time to be alone of to take a vacation. it's just there's not enough time. so i'm always feeling like i'm letting someone down or i'm just - you know, it's like my calendar's booked up of the next month-and-a-half now.    it's not always like that but to look out at the rest of the year, it's kind of like it's over. like the year's o - you know, years over. you know, i kind of hope that my life isn't always like that but there's got to be great things if you're planning that far out, i guess. you know, i feel very lucky for that. and the answer to your question really is feeling like i don't have all the time i wish i had to spend with all the people that i wish i could spend it with.   tim ferriss: now let me -   sophia amoruso: how do i deal with that?  tim ferriss: yeah, how do you deal with it? and let me ask, just to - in combination with that - and this is maybe a very silly question. you obviously are very driven and that sometimes leads people to find it difficult to hit the pause button or downshift. but you've stepped out of the ceo role, i would think as an outsider looking in, of course you're still going to be very involved as -   sophia amoruso: chairman.  tim ferriss:  - as chairman but why can't you create more time? why can't you block out time?  sophia amoruso: because the company still needs me for my things and i still partner with me ceo and still spend a lot of time with her. you know, i'm drumming up opportunities of the business, whether it's a collaboration or, you know, weighing in on something creative. you know, i still spend time there. you know, i've signed up for more thins than i probably should have. but you know, i - everyone should be so - i don't know, i feel like saying, no, is just!- it doesn't create opportunities. so i'm throwing all that i can into the air and just to see how much i can actually handle. i don't know, i'm like a glutton for punishment.   so you know, it's like i'm watching a podcast next month. i'm like promoting this paperback. you know, i'm working on another book. like who knows? i mean, i want girl boss to become its own thing. girl boss should be - is so much more than a book. it should be a business, it should be conferences, it should be so many things beyond what it is. it's just a matter of doing it, of making the time and finding the team. and oh, my god, what am i going to start another business? i'm not sure, you know, just doing all i can with all that i have and connecting things that shouldn't connect is what really, really gets me excited.    because that's where invention happens. and that's where i just get like really, really excited about things, so.  tim ferriss: what were some of the key inflections points for the company? so if you look back over the last, you know, ten years, whatever it is, what were some of the key inflection points that allowed nasty gal to become what it is, right? because i can think back, for instance, with the 4-hour workweek i can think very specifically to like the day that robert scoble at the time put something on his blog, was a clear inflection point. that was a clear inflection point. the appearance on droz, clear inflection point. meeting certain people, getting advice from, say, michael gerber who wrote the e-myth revisited.   and before i even write the 4-hour workweek he said, \"if you're going to write a book, write a fucking book. like don't half-ass it because a mediocre is more of a liability than a help.\" and blablabla, right. so i can point to very clear introductions, meetings, blog. what are some of those for you and nasty gal?  sophia amoruso: yeah. i would say it was launching. i mean, the first one would be just launching an ebay store. the next one would be selling a chanel jacket that i bought for $8 for over a $1,000. the next one would probably be launching the website and having it sell out just overnight. and then pretty soon after that hiring my first employee. after that it would be buying things that weren't vintage. so buying a small, medium and large of something from a trade show and bringing in new brands and testing. and seeing if your customer had an appetite for more than just vintage, which they did. then it was like, i think, it just, you know, scaling is - that's not an inflection point. but what happened? we outgrew our space in venetia. i mean, we've moved so many times but i would say after that it was raising $50 million from index ventures. for me personally, it was four pages in forbes in 2012.   tim ferriss: how did the four pages in forbes happen? because there's often some back story, right. not all of them were just gifts from heaven that get dropped in your lap and maybe this was but how did that come together? i mean, that's a significant -   sophia amoruso: wait, how did what drop in my lap?  tim ferriss: no. how did it come together? i'm not saying it did -   sophia amoruso: forbes?  tim ferriss:  - drop in your lap. forbes, yeah.   sophia amoruso: oh, my god. the way media works is - well, it was someone who i met through index. her name was julie supan and she was friends with someone who wrote at forbes and they're getting brunch and she mentioned me. and this reporter got interested and then i had no idea what i was doing. i'd never talked to the media before. and then julie used to run like pr at youtube and she consults for start-ups. and she's kind of like a maestro of all things publicity. and she was like, \"well, now that you have someone writing a profile on you in forbes, you probably need my help.\" so i don't know.    she did a great job and you know, so i hired her and she helped me just coach me through it. she was like, \"they're going to want you to look like billionaire, that's their - you know, we've had to reshoot other stuff that i've worked on forbes because they didn't think that the entrepreneur in his hoodie looked like a billionaire.\" so it's so funny, it's really funny just how all of that works. and so now i show up at photo shoots and i'm like, \"what do you want me to be?\" okay i'm bringing it.\" you know, it's like so dorky but you know, it's like whatever, you just try to do your best. what was that like? that was cool.  tim ferriss: what were some other pieces of advice that you got or things you've learned about interacting with the media?  sophia amoruso: oh, i've learned so much, i feel like - tim ferriss: i'll give one. always do fact check corrections via email and not phone.  sophia amoruso: yeah. that's smart.  tim ferriss: you need a paper trail of that stuff. i've misquoted so many times.  sophia amoruso: really?  tim ferriss: oh, yeah. and then that will sneak its way onto wikipedia and then it's a big, big quagmire to fix.  sophia amoruso: i mean; i think it's just that like the media always wants something to talk about. and they can skew things for their own - you know, for their own fun. you know, there's a time where i think i believed a lot of what i read out there. and i still believe a lot of it but when there's controversy it's often just to serve, you know, clicks and you know, get - yeah, i don't know. its's like, i don't know, i'm just kind of babbling. but be careful with what you say.  tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: and if you don't have anything to say then just don't say anything. i think it's okay to say, no.  tim ferriss: yeah, definitely. and also i mean, one thing that i've learned - because if you tea something out of context, like one sentence out of a paragraph it can make you look like, you know, a hero or a complete ass to a misogynist or an asshole or any number of things. so the context is so important. and what i've been doing for the last couple of years is if i send a response via email to a journalist, i'll just say, \"thank you for using this in its entirety. i do not give permission to slice and dice this. if it's going to be cut down, i need to give you permission.\"  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: and not everybody responds well to that. but usually the ones who respond poorly to that, if it's diplomatically worded, are the people who already had an agenda to slant something in a really controver - unnecessarily sort of an incendiary way.  sophia amoruso: and even like the most - you know, the best - some of the best journalists i worked with, they'll write a really positive story and then they'll throw in some shit just for their own credibility to make sure they don't sound like some big fan.  tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: so there's always going to be some shit that they like say that you're going to be like grumpy about but it makes them credible. and you just kind of have to like stomach it.  tim ferriss: yeah. i mean, you can help them also. you can facilitate things by saying like, here are two other of my detractors. but that can also give you - as long they're, say, factual attackers. does that make sense?  sophia amoruso: yeah. one said, i walked like an ogre in heels and it's like, no, like i've like go-go danced in public in fucking heels. i'm pretty sure i can fucking - it was just like, no. like it's fine but like of all the things like i can walk in heels, okay. you know, like just like pick something. just there's plenty of things to criticize, jesus, if you catch me in like a - you know, in the corner i'm probably picking my nose. like you know, just like find something real and talk about that. [inaudible]. tim ferriss: when are you happiest? sophia amoruso: god. i'm happiest when i'm like running down a trail in [inaudible],, downhill a little, just a little downhill. like and you jump and you feel like you fly like 20 feet, it's almost like a dream.   tim ferriss: oh, yes.  sophia amoruso: i think that's the best feeling is being like, i'm in a video game but it's real! like this is real life! and yeah, i think just like running down a trail in the forest is like maybe the best feeling ever.  tim ferriss: that's such a good answer. that's a [inaudible] answer. side note, if you come back to san francisco, i'm sure that'll happen at some point, there's place called house of air, which is basically a humungous building full of trampolines at different angles.  sophia amoruso: oh, god.  tim ferriss: and you can feel like you're in the matrix, it's amazing. do you struggle with depression or anything like that? and you don't have to, i'm not trying to -   sophia amoruso: oh, totally.   tim ferriss: it's not intended as - you do?sophia amoruso: i struggled with depression my whole life. i've been in and out of therapy my whole life. they tried to tell me i have add and give me some stuff in high school. and they tried to give me stuff for depression, it's made me - made me feel super wired. i think when i got busy that went away. more than anything i think i struggled with anxiety. so i can hit the ceiling by like 11:00 a.m., if something just doesn't go right. i mean, i don't like yell or pound my fists, i'm not like person in the office who throws things. if i'm not happy, ain't nobody happy, like in the room basically. i'm not good at hiding my feelings. it's unfortunate. and then there's people who value it and i try to keep those people around. but yeah, depression's like a gnarly thing.   tim ferriss: how do you contend with that? and i ask as someone who has similar ups and downs and has for as long as i can remember. but what are your coping mechanisms?  sophia amoruso: you know, it's easy to point at things in your life that are out of your own control. like i've pointed at who's - i got married like three months ago but i've - there's been times where i've pointed at joel and i was like, \"you're the problem.\" and it's like, no, you're just not - you're not solving your own problems. like i think you can just look everywhere outside of yourself to fix your problems and thank god i'm not like - [inaudible] addiction issues or anything. because i'm totally - if that was - if that ran in my family i'd be a total mess, i think.   i've taken anti-depressants at different times and some are better than others. but i just - i generally like to stay pretty - kind of - and alcohol. alcohol can help. yeah. yeah!  tim ferriss: that's - so - i - yeah, i'm not - sorry, i'm not going to interrupt you.  sophia amoruso: alcohol in reality -    tim ferriss: we'll come back to that.  sophia amoruso:  - [inaudible] i'm telling you. i'm laying of the booze more now though. but i mean, i can have one glass of wine and i'm like the happiest, most like charismatic like, you know, just fun person when -   tim ferriss: effusive. sophia amoruso: yeah. and when i'm not drinking i'm like, you don't want to walk up and talk to me. like i'm not friendly. like i'm not unfriendly, i'm just not open, you know. i'm just like kind of stuck in my head, you know, i don't know.  tim ferriss: what's your go-to wine drink or your go-to wine?  sophia amoruso: yeah. i like white wine, a lot of bars don't have white wine. but it would just be like a - i don't know i started drinking chardonnays, i like those. oh, i got gewztraminer. tim ferriss: oh, those are really nice.  sophia amoruso: it's really good, right?  tim ferriss: it's really good, very minerally -   sophia amoruso: you know what, the good one is the clif family, the clif bar people. i went to this thing in napa. oh, my god, it's so - i sound like so cool now. i like went on a bike ride. it was basically my investors have a retreat every year and all of the entrepreneurs and the partners at their firm get together. and this is at the - at [inaudible] ranch, which is like a really beautiful place in napa.  tim ferriss: gorgeous.  sophia amoruso: pretty fancy. and then they had these activities, you know, so you hear people, talk. and there's really cool people. like jerry yang spoke at the last one. and just it's really interesting and then they have this - you know, these activities and one of them was, you know, road biking and road biking up to a winery and then having a glass of wine. i was like, yeah, i'm getting in shape for my wedding like if i'm going to drink wine, i should get on a bike first, right. and oh, my god, these - all these guys, they're all european for one and they're like - you know, they're like wealthy guys who like have their own shoes and like all the clothes. and like do this - they like do it as a thing. you know, they're like those guys who [inaudible].  tim ferriss: oh, the cycling. so they had like $5,000 worth of gear.  sophia amoruso: and i just thought it was -   tim ferriss: [inaudible].   sophia amoruso:  - i thought it was like - it was just like going on a bike ride for fun. oh, my god, was the only person that like didn't finish it. i had to get in a car and like get a ride to the top of the hill. anyway, at the top of the hill was clif family winery. i'm like i don't know them. i'm not trying to like plug anything. it was just like i'd never heard of gewztraminer and i bought a few bottles and like had it shipped to my house. and um, yeah, i guess a white crispy wine.   tim ferriss: that's super tasty stuff. [inaudible] pretty good go-to for a lot of folks. i guess i usually do a gin and tonic, sort of a hendricks and soda is kind of my go-to if i don't want to have nasty, nasty headache. or tequila, as you've seen.  sophia amoruso: yeah. tequila's gnarly.    tim ferriss: you have to go with the good stuff if you're going to do tequila. so the casa dragones is very expensive but very tasty. i mean, you saw me, i had a fair amount to drink but no headache the next day, no cognitive dysfunction. felt just fine. when you think of the word successful - and i know that's a gnarly, dicey word, but who's the first person who comes to mind for you?  sophia amoruso: yeah. successful, the word success is really conflicted for me because it sells people this idea that there's like a destination. i think there's people who can mani - who have manifested things that - in the world that make more noise than other people. but success can just be like being a stay-at-home mom if that's your dram. success can be having a small business and keeping it that way and keeping - and laying low because that's what you want and that's the life that you want. as someone who's public, it's kind of like a - it's a hairy thing because i'm out there and i'm - i have a book and you know, i have a business and i sell things and whatever.    i just really want people to remember that they're capable of doing everything that the people they admire are doing. maybe not everything but if you're - don't be so impressed. i guess that's where - you know, where my head goes, is you know, there's no reason that you can't have the things that the people you admire - that you admire have. and so success just sells this kind of like ultimate destination when even though i've accomplished something and you've accomplished something and whatever, it's like you - i told you i was crying last night. and it's not like we - who - like my - you know, i'm done, i've arrived or anything like that. if you have any amount of hustle and any amount of humility you know that it all can go away tomorrow and that you should do everything you can with what you have today. so i guess, it's like a very philosophical way of saying, when i hear the word success, i don't know what? warren buffet? i don't - you know, it's like -   tim ferriss: tough.  sophia amoruso:  - i don't know.  tim ferriss: it's tough.  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: it's tough when you - you said, don't ask the cobbler if you're a brick layer, whatever. i was thinking of warren buffet when you said that because he often says don't ask a barber if you need a haircut. he's full of those.  sophia amoruso: totally.  tim ferriss: he's full of those. let me ask just a couple of rapid fire questions. you don't have to have rapid fire answers but just because i know that people will ask me why i didn't ask them if i leave them out. what is your favorite documentary or movie?  sophia amoruso: my favorite movie might be a film called the color of pomegranates and it's by this guy sergei parajanov. i'm not even sure if i pronounced it correctly. he was like a georgian filmmaker. and it's basically a moving painting. it's just one of the most - there's almost no dialogue, it's just one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen. you know, i grew up greek orthodox and i'm just still kind of enchanted with the - with eastern - the visuals of like eastern europe. yeah.   tim ferriss: sounds gorgeous. yeah, i need to sort of fill up my roster so i'll add that to the list. what are you world class at that people might not realize? or what do your friends know you're world class at the rest of the world doesn't know about?  sophia amoruso: wait, what did i put on my thingy?  tim ferriss: i don't know; i didn't read it. so for those people listening, i send - i could look it up. i send some of these question in advance just so people don't get totally stumped which happens. but i didn't look at the answers because i want it to be fresh for conversation. i could pick it up, i could look it up. bear with me a second, i'll pick it up.  sophia amoruso: oh, my god. i can use my brain. hold on.  tim ferriss: that's okay. that's okay. so let's see, we got playing catch.  sophia amoruso: oh, my god. yeah, i guess playing catch. yeah, no, i'm like i can have really good coordination to the point of it like being freaky. like if i dropped something i can be like looking in the other direction like scratching my armpit with one hand and then like swoop in a and like cat-like reflexes. like that happens sometimes. but it always - it even surprises me. and also i'm good at playing catch.   tim ferriss: i mean; did you play athletics as a - or sports growing up or n?  sophia amoruso: yeah, i played soccer. i mean, i played basketball, i played softball when i was like in third grade. and then i played soccer a lot. i snowboarded a lot. i never hacky sacked.   tim ferriss: san francisco awaits when you come back. we can do some like hula-hooping and -   sophia amoruso: totally.  tim ferriss:  - devil [inaudible] hacky sacking.   sophia amoruso: you could teach me how to breakdance.  tim ferriss: i could teach you? i could give some basics. we could do six-stepping next time you come along. what are the most common misconceptions about you?  sophia amoruso: well, i met some people yesterday who thought - they were like - i was like, \"what is - what's surprises you most?\" we spent some time and they - i showed them the office and talked to them about my business. and i was like, \"well, you know, what do you - what surprised you?\" and they said, well, you're not as egotistical as i thought you'd be. and it's like, wow, i mean, that's not insulting [inaudible] outside, you know, you put yourself on the cover of a book with your hands on your hips and you know, whatever. and maybe you expect something different but that was pleasant response.tim ferriss: yeah, it's better than the other way around. like wow, you're so much more maniacal than i could have imagined.   sophia amoruso: oh god, get me away from you.  tim ferriss: if you could have a billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say and where would you put it?  sophia amoruso: if i could have a billboard, i'd put nothing on it and i'd put it everywhere  tim ferriss: just an empty billboard?  sophia amoruso: yes.  tim ferriss: you know, i'm going to cheat here. i'm going to go back and see if there's anything else that - you had stop telling women to smile.  sophia amoruso: yeah, it's just like such a grumpy billboard though. i changed my mind. i'd rather have nothing.  tim ferriss: no -   sophia amoruso: you project what you want onto the billboards  tim ferriss: but - okay, so that's - that's and since i've given you this imaginary billboard, you're entitled to do that, but i want to hear the back story on stop telling women to smile. what's the sort of back story to that?  sophia amoruso: well, it's something that i've said. i mean i've said just like stop - don't tell me to smile or like, i mean, if you're a girl who's not like - who a guy wants to talk to and you intimidate them because you aren't like giggling or whatever, they'll like take a - it's like you're - we're there for your pleasure or - i don't know what it is. but it's happened to me from as early as i can remember. it's just like, \"you should smile more.\" or just like, \"oh, you look really pretty when you smile.\"   and it's like, \"that's nice, thanks.\" but there's something that's like, you're here for me, so can you just smile if i have to like look at you, you know, because you're making - like a woman evaluating me just makes me feel like emasculated or somethingkind of, you know, like they just like don't know how to handle itiand it's really frustrating. honestly, pretty insulting. and then i found out that there's a woman named - what is her name? i mean, she has like this - she's an artist, i think she's in brooklyn, and she started something called stop telling women to smile. and someone was telling about it other day. and her name is tatyana fazlalizadeh.  tim ferriss: it's a tough name.  sophia amoruso: yeah, it's just her long name. i'm embarrassed of how i did thatbut she has like wheat paste posters and kind of like a campaign like stop telling women to smile, like i'm not your baby, that kind of shit. which is just - i wouldn't put, you know, if i could put one thing on a billboard it would probably be nothing. maybe nasty gal if it was free, you know.  tim ferriss: okay. yeah. what was your thinking process around stepping down, stepping out of the ceo role?  sophia amoruso: well, yeah, i just - the things that i find myself - that i think i'm good at are not the things that a ceo wakes up every day to dorunning an executive team of c levels who have more experience, you know, than i've been in business for or - it's like there's a - like i said earlier, there's just a totally different skillset that comes with leading people and giving praise and repeating what we're all here to do   there's a lot of repetition actually, and i'm the kind of person that's like, \"what, you didn't hear me the first time?\" which is not - i'm not saying i'm proud of that, i just think that's kind of how i roll and i, you know, it's a whole - there's an art to leadership and yeah, i wanted to focus on the creative part of the business. you know, i want, you know, the book kind of had its own - it kind of made me the face of the company, which i wasn't prior.   and so there's things that come along with that that are good for nasty gal but take my time and take me out of the office, and there's nothing worse than feeling like you've abandoned the people who are reporting to you who need your time. it's just a matter of choosing. so i, you know, i chose, and it was something that had been - that i had been thinking about for a long time  tim ferriss: what was the first day like, or night, after you made the decision and you'd finally kind of made the call and knew that you were no longer going to be ceo?sophia amoruso: i think it was just a lot of relief. a lot of relief and just feeling i had done the right thing. i was really happy for sherry, my ceo, and it just seemed kind of like a non-event to our team. i expected more of a reaction but they were like, \"what's the difference? sherry is all of the all-hands meetings and she speaks, we know who she is, what's different?\" i don't think it was a huge change for most of our team, which felt good. yes!  tim ferriss: mm-hmm  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: that's great  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: that's huge.  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: that's a big [inaudible].  sophia amoruso: yeah, i expected a lot more questions and i was kind of bummed that people weren't like - they weren't like - they weren't like freaked out. they were like, \"okay, cool. okay.\"  tim ferriss: we've been waiting for years for that to happen. sophia amoruso: i know, get out of here!  tim ferriss: don't let the door hit you on the way out. i'm just kidding. what $100.00 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in recent memory?  sophia amoruso: i had a hamburger yesterday  tim ferriss: hamburger.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: what kind of hamburger? i mean was it a particularly -   sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss:  - interesting hamburger?sophia amoruso: oh, i don't know. i mean the one thing. i mean i could think - yeah, let me, i can think harder on this, but  tim ferriss: yeah, no, it's basically just inexpensive stuff that you get a lot of value out of.  sophia amoruso: let me think. i'm looking at my - i mean, a manicure. manicures are like pretty - they're good. they're like they make you feel better, but they cost like, you know, i get gel, so i don't know, maybe they're like, $20-$30 and you don't hate your hands as much. i don't know. what else? under $100. not a lot is under $100. it's like a hamburger or, you know -   tim ferriss: a manicure  sophia amoruso: probably a glass of wine. oh my god.  tim ferriss: that's true.  sophia amoruso: it's the same her  tim ferriss: that's a glass, no, a glass of wine is good. i actually bought one of my favorite bottles of wine i've ever had i bought from trader joe's. they have great wine service. i mean, the people really know what they're talking about.  sophia amoruso: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: it's four dollars for a bottle of white wine. and if you want to upgrade that you get the - i really like rombauer chardonnay.  sophia amoruso: oh yes! rombauer is good  tim ferriss: yeah, 2004 i think i had, which was amazing. and not that expensive. that was the first white wine i ever bought a case of. i thought i would never buy a case of white wine ever. i've always been a red wine guy, and rombauer chardonnay was the one that made the difference.  tim ferriss: what does the first 60 minutes of your day look like? now, i'm going to ask that a little retrospectively. when you were ceo of the company, on a day when you look back and you're like, fuck yeah, i kicked ass today, what did the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like, or what were your morning routines?sophia amoruso: yeah. i mean, i usually - and a day that ends well is one that started with exercise. that's for sure  tim ferriss: hm, yeah, so key.  sophia amoruso: i usually eat, you know, for breakfast - so i wake up - let me just -   tim ferriss: what time do you wake up?  sophia amoruso: i don't know, like 6:30-7:00. most people are like exercising at 6:30 or 7:00, but i'm just, i don't know, i stay up. i'm like i keep - i just keep weird hours. so i wake up, i take my invisalign out of my mouth, because i sleep with these braces in, basically. and before that it was a mouth guard because i clench my teeth because i'm a freak. but i recently botoxed my jaw so that i can't clench my teeth as much.  tim ferriss: whoa! so, what, you injected fat like into your -   sophia amoruso: no, it's not - it's not fat.  tim ferriss:  - mandible space, what? sophia amoruso: it's just something that basically makes your muscle weaker so that -   tim ferriss: wow!  sophia amoruso:  - you like don't - aren't such a - i'm like hulk smash. like i clench my teeth like the fucken hulk  tim ferriss: on no, i've - i sometimes like wake up with blood in my mouth guard -   sophia amoruso: oh my god!  tim ferriss:  - except clenching -   sophia amoruso: i can tell just by looking at your face. that's [inaudible].  tim ferriss: but i have like really overdeveloped jaw muscles like a pit bull  sophia amoruso: i can even picture you - i do. let me look at - hold on - let me look at you. um, i'll just google you right now. no, but it doesthat's what happens. you know, i have a jaw muscle that - no you don't - yeah, you have a strong jaw. but when you're a girl that is like kind of a masculine thing. whatever. but yeah, it also just you wake up with a headache. so i did that. that helped. i think that's helping actually.  tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: and then i wake up, i might pee. i chug water. i'll chug a bunch - i try to chug a bunch of water, but i don't always. and then i drink coffee with heavy cream in it  tim ferriss: how do you make your coffee?  sophia amoruso: we have a thing called a jura, like j-u-r-a. some company, and it's just like basically you put the beans in, it grinds them and it's just a coffee maker, i guess, but it's like a fancy coffee maker[inaudible]  tim ferriss: that's j-u-r-a.  sophia amoruso: j-u-r-a. yeah. but i put hot water in the glass, i fill the mug up about halfway with hot water and then i put a lot of shots of coffeei guess it's espresso, i don't know. are coffee beans and espresso beans the same thing?  tim ferriss: they are often roasted slightly differently. but my understanding is you're just using kind of more beans for the volume in the case of espresso.  sophia amoruso: okay.  tim ferriss: but the darker the roast is, my understanding, is the lower the caffeine is, interestingly enough.  sophia amoruso: interesting.  tim ferriss: but yeah, you're basically making an americano is what it sounds like.  sophia amoruso: yeah. you're making americano and we use david lynch coffee, if you haven't tried it. it's great  tim ferriss: david lynch, like the film [inaudible]?  sophia amoruso: yes, he has his own coffee.  tim ferriss: are you serious? he not only has transcendental meditation foundation in schools for at-risk youth, he also has his own - oh man, i'm really lisping like hell right now. but he also has his own coffee bean company.  sophia amoruso: totally. look up david lynch coffee, i just did. it's pretty good  tim ferriss: that's hilarious.   sophia amoruso: i don't know, my husband found it. but and then -   tim ferriss: okay. so you have your coffee with - why heavy cream?  sophia amoruso: i don't know. someone told me it's like better for stomach. and now the whole thing is that like fat's good for you, so i care even less. but i already knew that. so  tim ferriss: yeah.  sophia amoruso: and then i'll have one of maybe three things. i have rolled oats with a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk and a little bit of salt with raisins usually. just made on the stove top. or i will have a pancake that i make out of rolled oats. so i crack four egg whites into a bowl and then i put two cups of dry rolled oats in and then i stir it around and the eggs kind of help the oats congeal. and then -   tim ferriss: yeah, bind it.  sophia amoruso: yeah. and then i shape it into a pancake in a pan and then i cook - i like heat it up a little bit. and then i put it on a plate and i put apple sauce on it and a little bit of maple syrup. and i eat it and it's really good  tim ferriss: that sounds amazingly good.  sophia amoruso: i mean, but it's two ingredients, which is crazy. and it looks - it doesn't look as good as it tastes. it's pretty decent  tim ferriss: i bet that would be really good with like some nut mix.  sophia amoruso: yeah. or i drink like white smoothie, which is like has apple and greek yoghurt and some cinnamon. and it's just like pretty simplebut some of those recipes came from this guy that i trained with. i mean, harley pasternac, have you heard of him?  tim ferriss: i have heard that name. yeah, he trains with ufc fighters, right?  sophia amoruso: probably.  tim ferriss: or am i making that up?  sophia amoruso: probably. he's like a celebrity trainer type and he has people that work for him, and i most -   tim ferriss: oh, you know what? i'm thinking about mile dolce i think sophia amoruso: okay.  tim ferriss: instead of harley pasternac, yeah. but pasternac, i've heard of him.  sophia amoruso: yeah, he has some books and stuff. he's awesome, and i had just gotten some cool recipes from him. so those are his recipes. and then i'll, i don't know, i guess i shower, you know. or i'll go work out, you know, depending, sometimes i do, sometimes i don't. and then start my day. sometimes i'll roll out of bed and have a phone call and, you know, it's like we have a call. we're kind of like a call now and it's like i haven't showered. i don't know, i'm at home. sometimes i'll have calls for a while before i go in the office. sometimes i won't go in the office because i'm working on something that i need to focus on and that's hard to do in the office.   and whenever. every day is different. but they all start pretty much the same  tim ferriss: when you work out, if you could only choose a couple of exercises for the rest of your life, what would they be? and the reason i'm asking is i saw this photograph on your instagram account, which i thought was hilarious.  sophia amoruso: what?  tim ferriss: it was you on a - i want to say an elliptical, and it said, \"preparing the centaur for her wedding day\" or something like that  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: and because you have very well developed glutes, put it that way.  sophia amoruso: creepy [inaudible], i think i have to go. i'm kidding, i'm kidding.tim ferriss: no, this is purely anatomical, speaking as an exercise physiologist, and so those don't look like they came from ellipticals. or is that just a god-given gift?   sophia amoruso: that's - i like - i can't -   tim ferriss: because what i think, now you're greek, am i right?  sophia amoruso: i'm greek, italian and portuguese.  tim ferriss: oh, all right, that explain - okay. so i thought - i knew only about the greek part. i'm like, not usually - like if it was like, yes, i'm 80 percent brazilian i'd be like, okay, that makes perfect sense.  sophia amoruso: no. and people actually like get surgery to make their butt's - it's like i can't - if i wear a dress, like the top fits but then the bottom - i can't get the bottom over my hips or - or if like at the hips fit and like the top is too big and i'm not gonna like, i don't know, i don't want big boobs. and then like if i wear pants it's just weirdit's not - it's like - it's weird that like our culture is like into butts, because i think they're kind of gross, but  tim ferriss: well, i mean, i think you just have to watch like discovery channel for fifteen minutes and see like presentation posture and all that stuff and mammals have that fixation, i think.  sophia amoruso: hm.  tim ferriss: but the - not my intention to go there, but the exercises. so if you exercising, before you get started with the day and you could only pick a couple of exercises.  sophia amoruso: i mean, you basically asked me why i have a big butt. like that's what - [inaudible].  tim ferriss: no, no,  sophia amoruso: no, no, that's fine. i'm not, this is funny  tim ferriss: no, it's not just the -   sophia amoruso: what do you do - well -   tim ferriss: if you had to only choose a couple of types of exercise. not just for the butt, what would you choose?  sophia amoruso: well, the thing about having a big butt is that like it can go to hell really fast. so you have to exercise. i do dead lifts for my butt  tim ferriss: good for you, yeah.  sophia amoruso: or just some general. i do dead lifts.   tim ferriss: dead lifts are crazy  sophia amoruso: i do a lot of lunges. i do some like walking lunges and like some - i don't know; we do squats sometimes. i'll - like resistance training. what else?  tim ferriss: when you do dead lifts, are you doing sumo stance with your legs wide, or your legs closer together, kind of like shoulder width?  sophia amoruso: they're a little beyond shoulder width and like slightly bent  tim ferriss: right. and if you had to choose three type of exercises just for -   sophia amoruso: the rest of my life.  tim ferriss:  - the combination of like enjoyment and benefits for you overall, what would you choose?  sophia amoruso: probably like squat jumps. box jumps and let's see, like shoulder presses. i don't know.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  sophia amoruso: that seems like you could get a lot of different things happen with those three exercises  tim ferriss: right. and then you have the mountain - you have the trail running at a slight decline.  sophia amoruso: if i'm at big sur, yeah  tim ferriss: for the flying effect. i only want to ask a couple of more questions and then i will let you get back to your day. but this has been very fun.  sophia amoruso: nice.  tim ferriss: what advice would you give your 30-year-old self?  sophia amoruso: it doesn't get easier  tim ferriss: i mean, tell me more.  sophia amoruso: oh, i don't know. i mean, i think when you're like, yeah, i'm like on to something, my business is growing and oh, this is so cool, i can't wait for a time when, you know, i can just like, you know, let go or a time when i can, oh man, this is just going to be running itself someday, or i'm gonna - i don't know. like or just you think as you get older - i mean, yeah, you know more, you could handle things better, but it's the same. it's the same. you know, it's just - it's just different stuff, i guess.   and the challenges are bigger with bigger things. and, you know, i think it's easier to sell yourself or for maybe other people to sell you that it's just like one vacation after the next. and hey, i have a great life, i really appreciate everything that i have and i've taken some great vacations. but just that like the hustle never ends now.   but that was just a year ago. i was 30 a year ago, so hm. it would be like, hi, i don't know  tim ferriss: that's right. i keep forgetting that you're such a young'un. what are you most looking forward to in the next twelve months so far?  sophia amoruso: in the next twelve months i'm looking forward to going to tokyoyeah, we're going to tokyo, my husband and i, for like a weekand i haven't been since i was in high school. and it's just - i know it's a cool place. i have some memory of it, but things are so different when you're an adult. and i'm excited to check it out and eat food. now, i eat sushi, i didn't eat sushi when i was in high school. weird.  tim ferriss: oh yeah. now, that opens up all sorts of doors. well, if you ever want to chat about that, just feel free to ping me.  sophia amoruso: i'd love that.  tim ferriss: give me a call. i've spent a lot of time there. and actually have a two-part article on tokyo on the blog that goes through some of the smaller spots that i love. but that is exciting.  sophia amoruso: cool.tim ferriss: yeah, a week in tokyo is something i think everyone should doit's one of those completely alien places for english speakers where you can get completely lost, completely confused, even in the middle of the night and not really be in any danger whatsoever.  sophia amoruso: yeah.  tim ferriss: which is great.  sophia amoruso: yeah, you can like leave your purse, you know, on like - you can like give it to a bum and it's probably safe for an hour. you have an hour  tim ferriss: yeah, right. purse check. and it's just a fascinating, fascinating country. it forces you to question a lot of your own sort of social norms and behaviors, which i think is really helpful. so that is exciting. i'm super stoked for you. i'm going to headed to korea for the first time. i've only been in the airport.  sophia amoruso: oh cool.  tim ferriss: so i'm hoping to head to seoul within the next month or two.  sophia amoruso: that's exciting  tim ferriss: do you have any ask or requests for my audience? and the question after this is going to be where they can find you online and learn more about you and so on. but just in general, any like recommendation or request of my audience? any action they should take or things they should think about?  sophia amoruso: oh, that's for their own good?  tim ferriss: uh, yeah, sure. let's do that.  sophia amoruso: i don't know. compliment someone today. i don't know. say something nice to someone  tim ferriss: yeah, be nice. be nice. awesome. well, i would love people to check out what you're up to. you've done so much for such a young'un  sophia amoruso: thanks, tim. yeah. with a big butt, thanks.tim ferriss: a lot. well, that of course is a sort of high praise in my world. but where can people learn more about you, and find out what you're up to?  sophia amoruso: cool. well, nastygal.com. that's like, you know, my reason for existing. and then you can follow me on instagram and twitter and snap chat. it's sophia_amoruso. and i'm launching a podcast! i don't know, launching a podcast next month called girl boss radio. and you can read my book, it's called girl boss  tim ferriss: cool. yeah, and people will be listening to this for quite a while, so look for girl boss radio, guys, and the book has 835 reviews on amazon. four-and-a-half stars more than i want to say -

you know, i had time to kill on the internet", "and was getting friend request on myspace", "i'm not sure if anyone remembers", "oh, yes", "i'm kidding", "and so i was getting friend request on myspace from ebay sellers that were promoting their businesses on myspace", "and i wore almost entirely vintage at the time and i knew where to find it", "and i saw the prices that these vintage pieces were fetching on ebay and said, hey, you know, i can find them for way cheaper", "i know how to take a picture", "i'm pretty sure i know how to use the internet", "and ebay was a great place to start", "you know, there's a kind of like framework for you to sell online", "and it's really easy today but then building a website, like a web shop wasn't - you know, it wasn't as easy", "so started with ebay and you also have a built-in customer base there", "you put something and you can test like what works or if people like your taste or what you have to bring to the table", "so i bought ebay for dummies and had a friend model for free", "you know, and just found some vintage, sold some of my stuff", "you know, you can get a read on what people like really, really quickly because they watch stuff", "right", "there's something called watching, which is basically like you like monitoring it or adding to your favorites", "you want to see what happens with the auction over the course of the week or ten days", "and how did you know where to find vintage clothing", "it was like all i wore", "i just spent my youth in thrift stores, like discovering, just unearthing stuff that no one else wanted that i thought was really special", "and i made a career out of it", "did you have a favorite thrift store, at the time, in the bay area?ilet me think\u00e9 at the time, i don't know", "none of them are a real like goldmine anymore", "right", "i liked estate sales a lot because you can encounter people who have no idea what they have", "that's becoming rare and are", "and thrift stores are like onto vintage being valuable", "at the time, how would you find the estate sales", "just look in the newspaper or like at craig's list", "yeah, craig's list and the newspaper, yeah", "very cool", "and i'd like line up with all these people that were, i don't know, way older than me at like 6:00 a.m", "to be the first people in", "and i'd just run straight for the closet and hope whoever died had great style", "i saw the end, i didn't watch - i didn't see the entire thing, my girlfriend was watching it, the end of this documentary about a - i want to say a fashion icon named iris, who's now or when it was recorded or filmed in her 90s, 93", "and she has awesome style but i think it'll be hard to get to her estate sale", "uh, yeah", "so you got ebay for dummies, you know where to find the vintage clothing\u00e9  know how to take a picture", "known how to take a picture", "and you're getting an education of what works or what people are at least interested in, right", "mm-hmm", "through the watching", "do you remember your first sale or your first day of sales", "yeah, it was like - well, it was a week of auction so i watched what happened over the course of the week", "and at the very end some stuff goes crazy because people swoop in at the last minute trying to steal it from whoever was in the lead", "and you know, sometimes nothing happens", "but i learned really quickly what - you know, what was working and what wasn't and tweaked that, you know, every - with every auction, with everything i bought", "and i watched my competitors and i watched what they were doing", "and i just i try to a better job", "and i don't know", "what are some examples of maybe one of the things that you noticed in those initial tests and that you could be better at", "yeah", "well, the thumbnails are the thing that attract - that i mean, you evaluate everything as you browse ebay by a thumbnail and the tile of the item", "and those are two things that you can optimize just into kind of infinity", "i mean, there's a limited amount of space but i knew that using image that were really bright where you could see the silhouette of the item - ebay thumbnails have gotten a lot bigger but at the time they were teeny tiny", "so making it really obvious what the item was and even showing - you know, i had a - i would split the image in half and have, you know, half of the thumbnail be a full - like full-length shot of the item and then i'd have like a detailed shot like on the - maybe the right-hand side and the description", "so i mean, selling vintage is such an incredible way to learn perceived value because unless you're selling something that's like a designer like chanel jacket or whatever you're buying stuff that - you're buying it for the style and you're buying the things that have no inherent value that could be - that are - really are someone else's throw-away", "and exalting them a level that makes them worth more", "and worth more, i mean, ebay, it was the customer who determined the price", "they started everything at $9.99 and let them choose or let them fight over it", "but they only fought over it because i turned it into something really special", "and i breathed new life into these forgotten about things", "as a copywriter, how did you accomplish that", "and maybe that's a non-specific question that's unhelpful", "i'm just -   yeah", "for instance, i mean, a lot of people bring up i think it's influence by robert cialdini and they talk about say, you know, scarcity, time, restrictions, etc., as tools of persuasion that can be used for good or ill means", "how did you learn to write persuasive copy", "i don't know", "my mom was writer and reading and writing was always -

i guess that's it yeah", "okay", "all right, cool", "yeah, that venture deals for people interested in this world is a great book", "that's brad feld his partner, very, very good investors", "what were some of the biggest challenges for scaling an e-commerce business", "what were some of things that you guys - that you had to contend with", "let's just keep it focused on you but the company, of course, as it's growing", "and i've spoken with people like phil [inaudible] on the podcast and he's like, \"well\u00e9\" like this, you know, gent who runs rock utan, he's saying you should always plan online what if it's three times bigger, what if its ten times bigger", "there are sort of these phase shifts where systems have to be completely redone", "but for you, in growing the company, what were some of the hardest periods for you", "yeah", "i would say scaling is really hard", "so i would say infrastructure, so systems", "i mean, we still don't have the systems that we would like to have to be able to plan our business and evaluate our business and talk about it", "what would be some examples of systems?like i mean, it's really kind of like unglamorous stuff", "like an erp system, like enterprise resource planning, which basically connects the dots between, you know, different departments like finance and you know, merchandise and whatever else", "and right now everything that we do is living in kind of disparate systems that don't talk as much as they could", "right", "so that's a struggle today", "what else", "i mean, i would say people", "i would say like, you know, being - having never really been a manager prior to starting the business that is nasty gal, you know, my dream scenario at one point was - you know, was not getting out of a bathrobe and eating boston market like, you know, with my hands", "and yeah", "and then encountering, you know, hundreds of - you know, a team of hundreds who are looking up at you", "it's like a really scary thing", "and they all assume that you -   i thought you eat your dream was walking into the office of hundreds of people in your bathrobe", "and i was like that's very wolf of wall street", "oh, wow", "i kind of like that visual, like eating lobster tails while you walk through the office", "i would do that but i haven't", "should i start over or because i didn't make sense", "no", "no, no, no", "okay", "no", "it does make sense", "i mean, how - what did you view your - now you are no longer ceo, is that correct", "no", "yes, correct", "when you were ceo, what did you view as your job", "as entrepreneur ceo it's really tough because there's so many things that i've been a part of and done over the course of the company's history", "and i'm also kind of the brand cop", "the brand is my voice", "the vision is kind of growing out of the beginnings, the dna of what was nasty gal origin story", "so there's never been a point where i could just be like the cut and dry, i'm the ceo kind of person", "you know, i'm the cultural leader, i'm the - all of these things", "it was so many things", "so you know, when you're growing a business, it's really hard to say, no, i'm going to plug that hole, i'm not going to edit the photos i'm not going to - you know, companies spring leaks and when you have - when you've done so many different things it's easy to sprout arms and fingers and just start like, you know, overextending yourself by filling in the gaps as they present themselves over the course of, you know", "i don't think i got to choose my - what i did as much as i perhaps would've liked to", "even today, i'm not sure if i have that privilege because you kind of have to do what the company needs you to do for it to continue operating or to be - it's very vast", "and nine years of that is a really long time", "and i think my greatest strengths are with the brand and with marketing the brand and with the creative and the things that in the beginning built nasty gal", "and that's what i'm hoping i can focus on today", "how do you try to keep the team on the same page so that that sort of brand aesthetic and spirit doesn't get fragmented and turned into some frankenstein monster where you've become brands that you loathe or whatever", "you get the idea", "totally", "yeah", "how do you try to steer that", "you can really quickly become a caricature of yourself", "like yeah, like a spoof of like what you've done best", "and i think it's a matter of talent but it's also coaching", "but at the end of the day, i think, you really need to have tools that everyone can rally around and say, hey, this is what it is", "this is what the brand is, this is what we're all signing up to do", "not this is my idea versus your idea versus your idea", "because i think culture, like in a business that people really excited -

don't sling me around, like that's not cool", "and so we've been spending the last several months actually working on somewhat of a brand bible but also just filters for how we make decisions about what the voice is how we take pictures", "and you know, the world that is the nasty gal world and what the -

because it was gabe newell at one point in seattle", "somebody else then recommended i see this handbook", "it's really cool, you should check it out", "i think you might enjoy and people listening might get something out of it", "you can find the free pdf if you just search valve employee handbook", "it's pretty sweet", "i think i've seen that", "it's really beautiful and it's this teeny little cool thing", "yeah", "yeah, it's really well done, great illustrations but lays out the basic ground rules, right, for working within this somewhat unusual culture", "mm-hmm", "now you mentioned the - before i derailed us with the wolf of wall street analogy and you walking around in a bathrobe eating lobster tails, which actually i have a quick anecdote", "so when i was in college, one of my buddies - and i was in new jersey - and one of my buddie sends up calling us from atlantic city", "and he's like, \"there are limos coming to get you", "you have to come to atlantic city.\" we show up and he's just been on a bender and made like $200,000 blackjack and proceeds to spend it all in the next 48 hours", "and he was walking around the casino in a bathrobe eating and he ordered lobster tails for everyone on the like blackjack floor", "wow", "and so i was kind of imaging like you could be that person but with like a martini glass", "i love absurd -
