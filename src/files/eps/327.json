This is Tim Ferriss. And welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show where it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers to tease out the habits, routines, experiences, life lessons, frameworks, etc., that you can hopefully apply to your own lives. My guest today is someone I\u2019ve known for quite a few years now. She\u2019s incredible. Aisha Tyler. That is A-I-S-H-A-T-Y-L-E-R on Twitter, Instagram, Vimeo, and beyond. She is an award-winning director, actor, comedian, bestselling author, podcaster, and activist. She does just about everything. And if you\u2019ve enjoyed my episodes with, for instance, Brandon Stanton, Debbie Millman, or Adam Robinson among others, you will love this one. Whether you do creative work, wanna be too complex to categorize, want to overcome rejection and beat the odds despite the fears and insecurities we all have, this will have something for you. Aisha voices superspy Lana Kane on FX\u2019s Emmy award-winning animated comedy series, Archer which won four back-to-back Television Critics\u2019 Choice Awards. She is a regular on the hit CBS show, Criminal Minds, now in its 13th season, for which she has also directed. Aisha continues to host the CW\u2019s hit improv show, Whose Line Is It Anyway? And she\u2019s launching a line of bottled cocktails she created, Courage + Stone in summer of 2018. Take a breath. Sit back. That\u2019s not all. Let me get a little bit more in just to give you a taste. And man, this doesn\u2019t even capture a small fraction, but here we go. Aisha was a co-host for seven seasons of CBS\u2019s Emmy winning daytime show, The Talk, which she departed in September 2017 to focus more on acting and directing. She\u2019s also very well remembered for her character arc on Friends where she was the first African American to have a longstanding role on the show. Her feature film debut, the thriller AXIS, all caps, A-X-I-S premiered 2017 and won the outstanding achievement in feature filmmaking award at the 2017 Newport Beach Film Festival and then had a theatrical run at ArcLight Hollywood, Landmark, NYC, and Drafthouse in my home of Austin, Texas. Alamo Drafthouse. So much fun. A San Francisco native, where I also spent a very, very long time, Aisha graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in government and environmental policy which you might not have known. She is an avid gamer and passionate advocate and occasional adversary of the gaming community. And her voice can be heard in video games like Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, and Watch Dogs. Aisha is a bourbon and hard rock fan, a snowboarder, and a sci-fi obsessive. And we cover so much ground in this episode. It\u2019s very wide-ranging. She\u2019s hilarious. And I really, really, really enjoyed the twists and turns in this particular podcast episode. So, without further ado, please enjoy \u2013 and you can find more to enjoy at aishatyler.com, of course \u2013 the namesake of aishatyler.com, Aisha Tyler. Aisha, welcome to the show. Aisha Tyler: Tim, hello. Thank you. I\u2019m super excited to be here. This is our away. It\u2019s a very long home and away for us. Tim Ferriss: It is. It is. And you are partially to blame/credit for me having a podcast in the first place because I recall when you interviewed me for Girl on Guy podcast in San Francisco at my place. And I had so much fun speaking with you and fielding some fantastic questions, one of which I\u2019m gonna bring up, and then we\u2019ll backpedal. But the question will not be surprising to you I don\u2019t think. And I\u2019m gonna ask you to bring it up. But the conversation that we had in part contributed to me deciding to take a break from writing books which had completely burned me out and, in turn, helped birth this show. So, thank you for helping to send me on this path because it\u2019s become one of the most gratifying and fascinating things I could possibly imagine doing. So, thank you for that. Aisha Tyler: It\u2019s so thrilling to be here and really, really gratifying. Yeah. It\u2019s amazing. I think podcasts are wonderful and terrible beasts but really satisfying, even when they\u2019re punishingly difficult to manage. They\u2019re still so satisfying. So, I\u2019m really happy. I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re enjoying it. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re not gonna get into this right now, although we can. You have a book titled, Self-Inflicted Wounds, subtitle: Heartwarming tales of epic humiliation. And can you maybe repeat or even paraphrase the question that you would always ask guests on your show? Aisha Tyler: Oh, absolutely. The name for that book came from this part of my show, Self-Inflicted Wounds which was, \u201cTell me a story about something that\u2019s gone wrong in your life that\u2019s your own fault. You can\u2019t blame anyone else, not your ex, not the bullies in your school, not the man. You did it to yourself.\u201d And it was really a way of initiating a conversation about risk and failure because I feel like people see people who are successful and assume that a part of that success or a reason for that success is that they haven\u2019t made any mistakes and they haven\u2019t failed, that they\u2019ve got a charmed life in some way or they figured some kind of formula out. And the most successful people are people who don\u2019t just manage risk but engage in risk and court failure actively. So, I always love to have people listening see that someone that they admire and they think is really accomplished has really shit the bed seriously at some point in their lives, maybe multiple times because I just think it\u2019s instructive. I think people don\u2019t start because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re gonna fail. And there\u2019s just no way around \u2013 the path to success is through failure. You just can\u2019t get around it. Tim Ferriss: So, there are so many different directions I could go with this. And I want to go way back as maybe a montage flashback that we could have as a visual overlay as you\u2019re saying some of these things. And that is to your dad. And I\u2019ve, in the process of doing homework, read about your dad\u2019s favorite saying or question that he would ask. And I was hoping you could explain this or share this with people who are listening because I think it\u2019s amazing. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Well, I was raised \u2013 my parents divorced when I was ten. And my parents, I always joke that it\u2019s only rich people that can afford to fight about custody. You know what I mean? Poor people just do whatever they have to do to manage. And my parents, neither of them could really afford two kids. And also, neither of them could afford to pay child support. So, each of them just took one of us. And I was older, so I went with my father. And he was like, \u201cWhich one can wash itself?\u201d And that was the one that he took. It was me. And my father is the king of the very terse and pointed motivational speech. So, I would leave for school in the morning. I grew up in San Francisco. And at one point, we lived upstairs in a Victorian. So, I\u2019d go down these very steep stairs. And he\u2019d lean over the railing, and he\u2019d go, \u201cWhose day is it?\u201d And I\u2019d have to say, \u201cIt\u2019s my day.\u201d And then he\u2019d say, \u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d And I\u2019d have to say, \u201cGrab it by the balls.\u201d Then he\u2019d say, \u201cAnd then what are you gonna do?\u201d And I\u2019d have to say, \u201cAnd twist and twist,\u201d as I was going out the door. But it was funny because my dad was just \u2013 he was such a great dad. He was a really engaged guy. But he was a single father and relatively young. So, maybe there were a few boundaries of propriety that he danced along. But he just encouraged me to be aggressive. I think it\u2019s very hard for single parents. Period. And I think it\u2019s very hard for fathers and daughters because I just think if you\u2019re a dad, the world just looks like a field of broken glass and potholes and molten lava. And then you\u2019ve got this little kitten. And you\u2019re just so terrified to put the kitten down. So, either they grip very tightly, or in my father\u2019s case, they throw you up in the air and expect that they\u2019ve given you the skills to land. And that was definitely his strategy. Tim Ferriss: Now you mentioned the divorce which I have read was amicable. And it ended up resulting in you going with your father. And you have one sibling? Aisha Tyler: I have a younger sister. And she stayed with \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Younger sister. Stayed with your mom. Was that hard? Or did it not even occur to you to be hard because it just is what it was? Or was that difficult? And did you have constant contact? Or what was the dynamic like? Aisha Tyler: It\u2019s interesting because I think it was more the second for me. It just was what was happening. And I don\u2019t ever remember struggling in any grand way with the way that things were going. And look, maybe that\u2019s my nature. I know my parents worked very hard to be loving and available to both of us. And I had lots of access to my mother. And I talked to her all the time. And I called her for advice. And she got to be the fun mom or the advice mom. She didn\u2019t have to discipline me. She could just be the person who was there when I needed emotional support. I do know that one of the things it resulted in, at least when we were younger, was my sister and I \u2013 we weren\u2019t super close, but lots of siblings aren\u2019t super close when they\u2019re kids, whether they\u2019re living in the same house or not. They\u2019re fighting, and they\u2019re competitive. But as we got older, I became wildly protective of my sister. And my relationship with her is so intensely loving and affectionate now. And I don\u2019t know. Maybe if we lived in the same house driving each other nuts all the time, we wouldn\u2019t be as close as we are now. We spent the formative years of our lives living in different houses. But we like the same stuff, and we care about the same things. And our connection\u2019s really deep. So, I don\u2019t ever remember sitting up at night feeling any kind of agony about the fact that my parents were divorcing. I did watch them try very hard to stay together. I do remember that when they got a divorce, I was like, \u201cThey really gave it a shot.\u201d I could see that they really \u2013 they would break up, and they\u2019d get back together. And they\u2019d break up, and they\u2019d get back together. And I remember I\u2019d walk in on them, and they\u2019d be making out on the couch. I was like, \u201cThey are really giving this a go.\u201d So, when they decided it was over, I was like, \u201cOkay. Yeah.\u201d I don\u2019t ever remember it being a point of agony. Things changed. And maybe as a result, I tolerate change better than I would otherwise. Or maybe I even crave change. I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: Has it been your demeanor to generally look at things through a positive lens like that where you would frame what other people might try to frame as a very difficult, agonizing experience into something that was or at least is framed as something positive that you benefited from? Or have you had more of the time a tendency to frame things negatively? Aisha Tyler: That\u2019s a really good question. And I think about that a lot because I think that my attitude or my point of view about things is half biochemistry and half child-rearing. My father is just a preternaturally optimistic person. It\u2019s extraordinary. I always make this joke that if my father\u2019s house was on fire, he would get a stick and marshmallows. He just cannot be deterred. Or I\u2019ve never seen it. He\u2019s just never down. And so, I think that I inherited that. And maybe it\u2019s attitudinal. I think I just probably make up the chemicals in my brain that keep me typically upbeat. You know what I mean? And I think it\u2019s important because I think a lot of times when people are \u2013 if they have a hard time seeing the world positively or if they\u2019re struggling with depression, people are like, \u201cWell, you just need to look at it a different way.\u201d But I think that I probably just make more of the chemicals that enable me to be optimistic. I\u2019ve never really been depressed. But my father also was just a walk it off dad. He just did not feel sorry for me. And I was not allowed to feel sorry for myself. And so, when things went wrong \u2013 and this has definitely sustained till I was an adult \u2013 I just get up and I keep going. And that was because my father was raised \u2013 he lost his father when he was very, very young. He was raised by a single mother and tumbled down Pittsburgh with the very few opportunities for a black man at that time. And he just never felt sorry for himself. He was just like, \u201cLook, I can complain about the situation, or I can just keep moving.\u201d So, I think I\u2019ve been nurtured in that way as well which is the world is unfair. It\u2019s shot through with assholes. I still have to get up in the morning and make a life for myself. And so, it\u2019s probably a combination of those two things. Tim Ferriss: Were you, would you say, good at following his advice of not only grabbing life by the balls but twisting, which is a whole new level? Those are two really \u2013 you can gently grab balls. You can\u2019t really gently grab and twist balls. Aisha Tyler: Of course. The twisting is a \u2013 yes. That\u2019s an elevated form of aggression. Yeah. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m nailing it.\u201d That\u2019s not how I feel. But I do think that that attitude of just go \u2013 and I wrote a lot about it in my book, the idea that my parents raised me to be brave and in some ways, maybe too brave. But the result has been a relentlessness and in the pursuit of the things that are important to me. And that\u2019s not the same as, \u201cI\u2019m winning.\u201d I don\u2019t really think about things that way. But if I wanna do something, then I do it. And I don\u2019t really worry too much about whether it\u2019s gonna go my way, not because I expect it to go my way but because it doesn\u2019t matter if it goes my way because it\u2019s the engagement that\u2019s most meaningful to me. It\u2019s the effort. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So, by engagement, you mean the dogged persistence that you\u2019re developing. Aisha Tyler: The engagement in your personal goals. If I wanna do something, whatever \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s pick something really innocuous. If I wanna hike every day for a month, or if I wanna start meditating, if I don\u2019t dial it, it\u2019s not as important to me as not looking back and saying, \u201cI should have done it.\u201d It\u2019s the doing for me that is the reward. And then sometimes things go my way, and sometimes they don\u2019t. But the thing I find most upsetting is regret because that\u2019s something I have control over in the sense of if you didn\u2019t do it, you have nobody to blame but yourself. Tim Ferriss: Right. You can always attempt. You can\u2019t predetermine \u2013 Aisha Tyler: You can\u2019t \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 success. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. You can\u2019t predetermine the outcome. But you can predetermine the effort because the effort is the only thing that you own. You can\u2019t own results. You can only own initiative. Tim Ferriss: And you mentioned your dad being a walk it off dad. I wanna explore that a little bit. Do you remember any \u2013 while you were still under his watch or not \u2013 early disappointments or self-inflicted wounds and how your dad responded? Or mistakes? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Well, this isn\u2019t exactly a good example of a disappointment. But it\u2019s a perfect example of his attitude. I was going to camp. I must have been about eight or nine. I\u2019ll say nine. And I was going to Jiu-Jitsu camp. And this was still during the free-range parenting era where you just got up in the morning, and you left at home, and you came back later. And that stuff was your responsibility. So \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Wait. Did you say eight or nine and then Jiu-Jitsu camp? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. I was really into martial arts when I was a kid. So \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, okay. It was making me think of the movie, Hanna where \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Eric Bana trains his daughter to be a super killer. I\u2019m just \u2013 Aisha Tyler: I wish I was that good at Jiu-Jitsu. But unfortunately, that was not one of my stronger \u2013 but as I\u2019ve pointed out, it wasn\u2019t the result that was important. It was just the effort. So, I would ride my bike to camp every day and ride it home. And it was a good ride. It was a five-mile ride to camp. And I fell one day coming down a hill. This was no helmets. This was a long time ago. I\u2019m very old. No helmets. Just willy-nilly your backpack on, and you\u2019re not signaling. And I fell. And I hurt my arm very badly. And I think I went \u2013 I can\u2019t remember, but I contacted my dad. And he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna come get you. I can\u2019t leave work. You have to get home on your own.\u201d So, I rode my bike back from camp another three, four more miles. And my arm was broken. It was definitely broken. I had broken my arm. And I got home. And my dad was like, \u201cYour arm\u2019s not broken. You need to stop complaining. It\u2019s just sore.\u201d And the next day, I woke up. It was black and swollen. And I had to lift it off the pillow. And he finally took me to the doctor, and it was absolutely a compound fracture. The bone hadn\u2019t come through the skin, but it was a multiple fracture. I think at the time, it felt cruel. But I think my dad\u2019s larger attitude was, \u201cNo one is coming to save you. You have to save yourself. You have to find a way every single day to save yourself.\u201d And as a result, I think that as an adult, I just don\u2019t spend a lot of time anguishing over what\u2019s been done to me. And I was fine. I did ride my bike home. And my arm was broken, but I still got home on my bike. And then the next day, I got a super dope cast. And I think we just raise these \u2013 I know I sound like everybody\u2019s mom, but I just feel like we\u2019re curating young people\u2019s experiences so aggressively nowadays that they just don\u2019t have any way to discover things about themselves. They don\u2019t develop not just self-sufficiency but a curiosity about themselves and their abilities and what they can tolerate and what they can do if left alone because they\u2019re just never left alone. I had a lot of time alone when I was a kid, and I still really like being alone as an adult. Tim Ferriss: Right. And also, it strikes me that if you\u2019re so protective of your child and your child\u2019s ego that you effectively disallow them to fail or engage with risk that the delta, the difference between their actual competencies and abilities for self-preservation and their overinflated sense of their capabilities is actually a huge disservice. Aisha Tyler: Oh, absolutely. And their sense of \u2013 you need to know what it feels like to fail and then what comes next because what comes next is, \u201cWhat did I learn? How can I adjust? How do I pivot? How do I move forward?\u201d And just most people don\u2019t develop those mental skills. They\u2019re crushed by failure. And it\u2019s just an unavoidable element of life. And there\u2019s so many people that I know whose \u2013 out of real, genuine love, parents like, \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna see my kid in pain.\u201d But how are you gonna \u2013 how do people move through the planet? How do these people move through life without pain? That\u2019s a false theory. It can\u2019t be done. It just cannot be done. And so, people just become incapacitated the first minute they hit any kind of a speedbump in their lives. And they just don\u2019t know how to navigate disappointment, whereas I was just deeply disappointed throughout my childhood, so I know exactly what it feels like. I\u2019m just like, \u201cNext.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat didn\u2019t go my way. Moving on.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Well, yeah. And it makes me conjure in my mind the image of this increasing amplitude of pain consequence over your life from childhood to adulthood where the consequences grow potentially greater and greater, where in the beginning, when you\u2019re a child, you\u2019re basically engaging with pain and \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say pain but failure in many cases. Not all cases but many cases where you\u2019re effectively in one of those birthday party blowup sumo suits. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? Aisha Tyler: Yes. Yes. Tim Ferriss: And it\u2019s like, \u201cAll right.\u201d So, you can engage with failure that way. And if you get knocked on your ass, there aren\u2019t really real consequences. Then you get to high school, college, and it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. You\u2019re out of the sumo suit, but you\u2019ve got big, blowup boxing gloves on and a huge piece of headgear.\u201d Then when you get out into some aspects of the real world, it\u2019s just a bareknuckle brawl. And so, if you haven\u2019t had the chance \u2013 Aisha Tyler: With permanent consequences and real \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah, exactly. So, if you haven\u2019t had the chance to get wailed in the face with a sumo suit, you\u2019re not gonna be ready for the blowup boxing gloves and the headgear. And certainly, if you don\u2019t get whacked in the face a few times doing that, you\u2019re just gonna be crippled when you get out into the real world and get dropkicked in the face by someone who doesn\u2019t follow the same rules. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. And crippled in that way that \u2013 and I know you\u2019ve interacted with people like this. In that way where when something bad happens, their whole monologue is like, \u201cWhy me?\u201d Like, \u201cWhy did this happen to me? You don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re not special. Everybody is experiencing the same thing. Everybody\u2019s heart is being broken. Everybody isn\u2019t getting the job they want. Everybody isn\u2019t gonna sleep with the hot person they want. Everybody is experiencing the same failures, these same injuries. But you just don\u2019t know how to tolerate them. You are not special.\u201d And that\u2019s not the same as saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the potential for being special.\u201d But there\u2019s nothing anybody\u2019s doing now that hasn\u2019t already been done or that won\u2019t be done in the future. And those kinds of personalities drive me crazy because they\u2019re so stuck and boring. Tim Ferriss: What did you think you were going to be when you grew up when you were in high school or college? Aisha Tyler: Oh, God. In high school, it\u2019s so interesting because I was super academic. And I think I thought I\u2019d be an attorney. I was a big activist, and I organized and marched and did all that stuff. And I was in the outing club. And I rock climbed and all that stuff. So, I thought I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. Either an environmental lawyer or an environmental engineer. And then I got to \u2013 and I really wanted to go to a school that was really grounded in a relationship to nature. So, I was applying to Marlborough College and Reed and Bard, and these schools that were out in the woods. And I ended up going to Dartmouth which is in New Hampshire and has this big land grant around it. And I thought I would be an environmental engineer. And I think I just took the first prerequisite math course for engineering. I was like, \u201cYeah. Okay. It\u2019s just not gonna be \u2013 just not right.\u201d And I always loved science, but I\u2019m just a person of letters, I guess. And I didn\u2019t have the appetite for it. It wasn\u2019t as glamorous as I thought. I think when I took my first engineering \u2013 I think I\u2019d got through the math class. I did fine. I applied myself, and I got a good grade. And then I went into my introduction to engineering three, and it was about building a fecal matter treatment plant. And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t feeling like hugging trees at all, man. We\u2019re just talking about poop all day.\u201d I lost my appetite for that really quickly. Tim Ferriss: So, then what? Did you just have this great existential angst? Or did you shift to something else immediately following that? Aisha Tyler: I was always doing performing things on the side. I went to a high school that had a performing arts magnet or a pocket school within the regular school called the J. Eugene McAteer School of the Arts. So, I was doing my regular classwork and then doing improv and stuff and sketch on the side. And then I went to Dartmouth, and I was just doing some of the same stuff. I was in one of those infernal ivy leagues acapella groups that have been popularized since then by shows like Glee. So, I was always doing that as a hobby because it just never felt like a real job. And I graduated. And I was living in San Francisco, and I was working for a conservation organization that was a killer. I got my dream job. It was a group that purchased blighted urban land and turned it into parks in underserved neighborhoods that didn\u2019t have any outdoor space for kids to play. The mission was great because it wasn\u2019t just conservation for conservation\u2019s sake. It was conservation focused on engaging underserved communities. And it was the grooviest. And I was just miserable. And I just \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Why were you miserable? Aisha Tyler: I didn\u2019t know. It was a really good question. It was like, \u201cWhy, if I have my dream job in the city of my birth, why am I so unhappy?\u201d And I just did a lot of soul-searching. And I realized it was because for the first time in my life, I wasn\u2019t doing anything creative. I wasn\u2019t performing. And so, I\u2019m a problem-solver. I\u2019m a matrix builder. I was like, \u201cWell, how can I solve this problem right now?\u201d And I looked at all the ways that I could get on stage. And standup comedy was the only thing I didn\u2019t need to know anyone for or have an agent or a band or connections. I could just do standup right away. And so, I started studying it and watching the precursor to Comedy Central which was this network called HA!, a very short-lived network, and taking notes. And then after a while, just screwed up the courage to go and do an open mic. And then it was just transformational. I was like, \u201cOh, this is what I want to do with my life.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Was the thinking immediately on how to turn performance into a career? Or did you expect that you would continue doing your job and doing standup on the side? Was it a career move from when you first built the matrix and decided on standup? Or was it, \u201cYou know what? This is gonna be great. I\u2019ll continue doing this job, and I\u2019ll scratch my creative performance itch on the weekends with open mics\u201d? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. It\u2019s so funny because I don\u2019t think I even realized that standup comedy was a job. I was a really bookish kid. A lot of guys will have these stories about how they grew up with Redd Foxx on vinyl that they listened to hundreds of times or following Lenny Bruce or these idols or Bill Hicks. I remember seeing Live on the Sunset Strip when I was a kid. But I just thought Richard Pryor was an alien. You know what I mean? Like, a magical person who came down to do this thing. The idea that that was a vocation was just not in my head. So, I remember seeing standup at Dartmouth when I was a sophomore and coming out of a show and being like, \u201cDo people know that you can go and have this feeling for an hour? This is insanity.\u201d I just remembered everything hurt from laughing. My face and my stomach. And I just never experienced live comedy before. So, it didn\u2019t dovetail into a job at first. It was just something I was gonna do for fun. I kept my day job 100 percent. And I kept it for a long time. I also didn\u2019t wanna be one of these miserable, sweating standups who were gripping their inky notebook and sleeping on their buddy\u2019s couch. I was in a relationship. And I had a job. And it paid great. And I could make flyers for my shows at work. I was embezzling copy paper and pushpins as aggressively as I could. So, I was and I still am of the opinion that you should absolutely keep your day job which I know is not in the most popular \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m of the same opinion. Absolutely. Yeah. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. I think it gives you a freedom. People think it traps them. But I think it gives you this incredible freedom to just pursue art for art\u2019s sake and let a job pay for it and do it for so long that everything you do is just for joy. And it changes the way that you approach your art. I would get up, and I\u2019d go to work at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning. And I work until 4:00. And then I\u2019d jump in the car, and I\u2019d drive two hours to Sacramento to do a set. And I\u2019d come back at midnight. I\u2019d do it all over again. But I could do that. And then it was just purely about the experience of performing and not about whether I was getting paid or not. So, I did that for a long time before I finally quit my job. Tim Ferriss: Now, for those people who don\u2019t know the geography of northern California where I lived for 17 years and \u2013 coincidentally, the high school that you went to, is that now the Ruth Asawa School on O\u2019Shaugnessy? Aisha Tyler: Yes. It\u2019s on O\u2019Shaugnessy. Yeah. Up there at the nexus of \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Twin Peaks/Glen Park Canyon. Aisha Tyler: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So, I literally lived for five or six years about a quarter mile from that school. It was right there. Aisha Tyler: It\u2019s not a big city even though I think when you live there, it feels like it. But it\u2019s an intimate place. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s an intimate place. And given the density of San Francisco and the fact that it i \u2013 well, I\u2019m not gonna go so f \u2013 I don\u2019t know if people would consider it a comedy town, but there are certainly clubs and so on. Aisha Tyler: Oh, it\u2019s a comedy town. It\u2019s a comedy town. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, why would you go all the way to Sacramento? For those people who don\u2019t know the area, it\u2019s not a ten-minute drive away from San Francis \u2013 Aisha Tyler: No, it\u2019s far. It\u2019s far. San Francisco\u2019s always had a reputation for being a comedy town. The big comedy towns in the United States from the comedian\u2019s perspectives are San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and New York. LA is a company town, but it\u2019s not a comedy town. And San Francisco was always one of those places that people saw as a real crucible for original comedy. It was where the alt comedy movement happened and where Marc Maron and Janeane Garofalo and these alternative comics, Brian Posehn came out of. And it was a comedy town. But when I started doing comedy, it was the beginning of the contraction of the comedy economy. So, there was a period of time when there were just hundreds of comedy clubs everywhere. And you could make a living doing standup. You could go from place to place, and you could get a gig, and you could get paid. And I started doing standup at the beginning of the end of the comedy bubble. So, when I started doing standup, the club community was contracting. And some of the big clubs in San Francisco were closing. I think at one point there were maybe five or six active clubs. And then by the time I was working consistently, there were only two. And there was just a lot of competition for stage time. And to get good at comedy, you can\u2019t just do it once a weekend. You need to be on stage every night. It\u2019s like being a high diver. Or you know what? It\u2019s literally like Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s 10,000 hours. And you\u2019re not gonna get 10,000 hours of standup hanging out in San Francisco. You have to go everywhere and take every single opportunity to be on stage that you can get. So, I would drive to Sacramento. I would drive to Fresno. I would do these terrible bar shows in Menlo Park and \u2013 oh, God. I don\u2019t even remember some of the places. Cupertino and Martinez. You would just go anywhere that you could get six minutes on stage. And there were 100 other people trying to get those same six minutes. So, it was really competitive. The culture I think was pretty supportive. Comedians were supportive of each other. But there just wasn\u2019t enough stage time, so you would just do anything and go anywhere to get it. Tim Ferriss: I wanna ask about this comedy contraction. We won\u2019t spend too much time on this because I don\u2019t wanna take us completely off the reservation, but what happened? It was like Beanie Babies? People were really into Beanie Babies, then it\u2019s like, \u201cNo. Comedy isn\u2019t cool anymore.\u201d And then all the clubs closed? Was it just a macroeconomic downturn? What happened? Aisha Tyler: I think there were three factors. One factor was just there was just a glut. Live comedy, in some ways in the \u201870s and \u201880s, was a new thing. And it\u2019s not like people hadn\u2019t been doing standup prior to that. But the proliferation of standup comedians in the culture really started happening at that time. And what that was fueled by, I honestly don\u2019t know. Why were there so many more comics doing standup in the \u201870s and \u201880s? Maybe because that was the period where there were these superstar comics that were \u2013 and I\u2019m trying to think of who would have been really popular besides Bill Hicks and \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I can see that though. Maybe it\u2019s analogous to celebrity chefs in the last 15 years. Aisha Tyler: Yeah, exactly. But part of the reason why there are so many more celebrity chefs is because there started to be celebrity chefs on television. And so, if you think about that in terms of comedy, what you see is, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a job. I could make money at that,\u201d whereas people weren\u2019t really encountering live comedy if they didn\u2019t go to a live comedy show. And so, you start to see these guys on TV, and you think \u2013 and honestly, when HA!, the precursor to Comedy Central started, they needed comics, and they needed opportunities. They needed clubs. They needed content. It was a 24-hour network. So, there were some good comedians on that station, and there were some really shitty ones. Really bad. And so, a lot of people watching probably thought, \u201cWell, I can do that.\u201d I also think about guys like Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay. There was a golden era in that time. And we were seeing all those people on TV. Then we were seeing a lot of people that were really subpar. And a lot of people were thinking, \u201cWell, if that guy can write five crappy minutes about an airplane, I can.\u201d Then you couple that with this explosion in comedy clubs which were a relatively new phenomenon. When Joan Rivers was doing standup, she was doing standup in strip clubs. There were very few comedy clubs. And comedy was part of a vaudeville approach. So, you\u2019d hire a singer. And then you\u2019d hire a comic. But there weren\u2019t places dedicated to comedy. So, these comedy clubs opened. It was a really easy way to make money because comics weren\u2019t that expensive. And you had a two-drink minimum. People would come in. They would get wasted. You\u2019d have huge margins on your booze. So, these comedy clubs started proliferating. And then there was just peak clubs. It would \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s saturation. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. It became unsustainable. So, they started to contract because of market saturation. The economy started to contract in the \u201880s. And people could watch comedy on TV. The proliferation of comedy on television affected people going out to see it in a club. So, there were those three factors all intersecting. And when it happened, it was really aggressive. Like I said, I think there were maybe five or six comedy clubs in San Francisco when I was in high school. And then by the time I was doing standup in my 20s, there were two. And so, you would do \u2013 and they were attracting high-end, peak talent. So, for example, this club is still there. It\u2019s called The Punchline. Tim Ferriss: Punchline. I\u2019ve been there a few times. Aisha Tyler: There was The Punchline, and there was Cobb\u2019s. And those are still the only two clubs. And maybe there\u2019s some minor clubs that have sprung up since then. But they would book these big headliners. So, the only time you could go up if you were an amateur, a young comic was on a Sunday or a Wednesday. And there\u2019d be 20 other guys trying to get on as well. And it would be wildly competitive. And you wouldn\u2019t be getting paid. And then you\u2019d be super anxious because you\u2019d be hoping, \u201cOkay. I need to go up, and I need to destroy because I want this club owner to hire me again. So, I can\u2019t work out. I can\u2019t fail in front of this guy because he won\u2019t see this \u2013\u201d you know when you watch an Olympic skater during practice, and they\u2019re falling? That\u2019s what practice is for. Practice is for finding your weak spots and reinforcing them. But when you\u2019re up in front of a comedy club owner, and it\u2019s been six months that you\u2019ve been trying to get out in this club, and you finally get five minutes, it\u2019s gotta be a monster five minutes. And so, there was just no way to improve. You can\u2019t improve \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I was gonna say, how do you get in your rough drafts then? How do you work on the material? Aisha Tyler: Drive to Martinez and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Oh, I see. I see. So, you\u2019d work out the kinks with the crew at the such and such casino in God knows where, Turlock. And then \u2013 [Crosstalk] Aisha Tyler: \u2013 Fubars or Rooster T. Feathers or one of these other places that \u2013 yeah. And there was this \u2013 it\u2019s different than being an author or an athlete or even a musician because there\u2019s an autonomy to comedy, absolutely. But you need other people. You can\u2019t do it \u2013 you can\u2019t just sit around your place practicing. You know what I mean? With music, you know if you\u2019re sharp or flat. You know if you hit all the notes. You know if the tempo\u2019s right. But with comedy, the only way it works is in front of an audience. And so, you\u2019re very dependent on stage time. And it\u2019s everything when you\u2019re a young comic is stage time. Tim Ferriss: Well, do you remember your early content? What was your approach early on? Do you remember the first \u2013 and maybe a different way to approach this \u2013 you could answer it however you like. Do you remember the first time that you bombed? Or what is your first memory that comes to mind of bombing? Aisha Tyler: Oh, God. I bombed so many times. It just all seeps together into an inky blackness. Any comic who tells you they never bombed is lying. And again, the only way to get funny is to bomb. No one ever gets funnier after they kill. They just walk out like, \u201cFollow that, bitches.\u201d And they drop the mic. You know what I mean? And then they go off and do shots with their friends. You really need to bomb and bomb hard to get funny. I remember doing this one show \u2013 oh, God. So, there was an open mic in a laundromat in South Market, around the police station there. So, maybe 8th and Mission or something like that for people who know San Francisco. And I think it was called Brainwash. I think the place was called Brainwash. And they would have this open mic in the back of this laundromat. And comics know with these local open mics that typically, there are no actual audience members in the audience. It is just a room full of comedians waiting for you to be done so that they can try out their material, all of them looking at their notebooks, not listening, not laughing. And you\u2019re just trying to gut it out and pause where you think the laughter might occur if you were in front of actual human beings. And I just did a set where I did not get one laugh, not even a cursory titter. And I remember just silence. Just a wall of silence. And I got off. Even thinking about it right now, it\u2019s so funny to me. I talked to a girlfriend afterwards and was like, \u201cOh, my God. I couldn\u2019t even call that a bad set. I don\u2019t know what that was.\u201d But it was so funny to me that I didn\u2019t get a laugh. There was this bulletproofness that I got from that set that just made me impervious to anything ever going wrong in my life or career again. And even when I\u2019m talking about it now, there\u2019s a huge smile on my face because it was so funny how little I was able to elicit out of that audience. But it just made me so mentally strong. Tim Ferriss: Was that the immediate response that you had? Or were you in the middle of the set when you\u2019re in the back of your mind thinking, \u201cWow, no one is laughing,\u201d was there \u2013 did you go from pan \u2013 was it the reverse of the five stages of grief where like, \u201cWhat\u201d? Or did you just go straight to, \u201cYeah, motherfuckers. This is great.\u201d Aisha Tyler: Just the acceptance. Just full acceptance. Tim Ferriss: \u201cThis is gonna make a great story however many years from now on Tim Ferriss\u2019 podcast.\u201d Aisha Tyler: Well, one thing comedians love is agony. We dine out on it. It\u2019s definitely our stock and trade. So, a comedian very quickly transitions from, \u201cOh, my God. This is the worst night of my life,\u201d to, \u201cOh, my God. This is gonna make a great story.\u201d That happens almost instantaneously. So, we have some armor in that regard because we could wake up naked and shivering on the side of the road with no money and no phone and not speak the local language, and you\u2019d be thinking, \u201cOkay. If I live, this is gonna make a killer story.\u201d So, I think in the moment, I just thought \u2013 I had watched a couple other people go up and not do very well either. I was prepared for it not going my way. And I just thought, \u201cI\u2019m just \u2013\u201d and I think also, there\u2019s a discipline to comedy that if you\u2019re not a comedian you can\u2019t understand which is that you\u2019ve got to get up and do your set. You don\u2019t get to tap out. Tapping out is true failure. If you went up and you had a bad set, well, you just need to write new jokes. But if you go up and you give up, that\u2019s true failure for a comedian. And there are some really famous examples of this online. I don\u2019t know if you know the comedian Bill Burr, but \u2013 Tim Ferriss: So, I interviewed Bill Burr about a year and a half ago, and I played the video which he had never seen, or he claimed to have never seen. Aisha Tyler: Yes, because he had some real \u2013 he still has some psychic \u2013 he has some trauma. He has some \u2013 Tim Ferriss: So, for people who don\u2019t know the story, can you please describe it? Because it\u2019s amazing. Aisha Tyler: It\u2019s insane, right? It\u2019s insane. So, he was doing one of those radio station concerts like the Jingle Ball or whatever. And I don\u2019t remember. It was called the Weenie Roast. I think it was the Weenie Roast. So, it\u2019s one of the shows at some local sta \u2013 like, \u201cK-Rock. 97.Rock. K-Rock.\u201d Like one of those shows. And it\u2019s like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Weezer\u2019s too cool of a band. It would be Nickelback and some other band that sounds like Nickelback and then an opening band you\u2019ve never heard of. I don\u2019t know why people still do this, but if you\u2019re a comic and somebody offers you money, you take it. So, they would hire a comic to warm up the crowd early in the day. And no one pays to see Nickelback and then wants to sit through 15 minutes of standup. Everyone\u2019s drunk and on drugs. And they\u2019re not even facing forward. The only thing worse than performing in front of an outdoor audience is performing in front of people who are eating because \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This was like a tailgate at 11:00 a.m. or 1:00 p.m. or something. Yeah. Aisha Tyler: Everybody busted out their marijuana brownie recipe for the year. They\u2019re all completely looped. One of their eyes is completely dilated, and the other one is falling out of their head. Nobody cares about your jokes about your mom and your family. So, they could not muster compassion if they tried. So, he starts doing standup, and he just immediately starts getting booed. And it\u2019s just this tidal wave of disdain. And he knows if he doesn\u2019t finish, he will not get paid. But it\u2019s not like \u2013 silence, you can tolerate. But people are screaming at him to get off stage. And he makes it very clear to the audience \u2013 you have to watch it because I\u2019ll never be able to do it justice. But he makes it very clear to the audience that he is not leaving the stage until he does his ten minutes, that he does not care how they feel about him. And he\u2019s counting down the minutes as they \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Every minute he\u2019s like, \u201cNine minute, you fucking fucks.\u201d Aisha Tyler: Exactly. He says something really outrageous like, \u201cI hope your mother gets cancer in the center of her asshole. Seven minutes.\u201d And it\u2019s just so \u2013 it\u2019s just a demonstration of tenacity. Later, he was embarrassed by it. But every comedian understands this blood battle that you sometimes have with an audience where they\u2019re not gonna scare you, and they\u2019re not gonna drive you away. You\u2019re going to deliver the material that you were hired to deliver. You\u2019re going to make your money. And then you\u2019re gonna go off and spend it on light beer and chicken wings. But you will not be deterred. So, I think because you understand that as a comedian very early on in your career, no matter what happens on stage, I will not be moved. So, I had material to do. And I did it. And I remember thinking almost immediately, \u201cWell, okay. I\u2019m not gonna get any laughs. So, I\u2019m just gonna listen to this set and see what it feels like, see what the words feel like, see what might play in front of actual people.\u201d But it started to get really delicious. And I think if you watch the Bill Burr video, you\u2019ll also see that he starts to really enjoy it. It starts to be this savory masochism towards the end where he\u2019s so powerful in his lack of caring. You know what I mean? And you watch it, and it is to be studied because he goes from anguish to rage to this delightful detachment by the end of the set. And I\u2019ve seen some other guys do similar stuff. And it\u2019s always really fun to watch. Tim Ferriss: So, a couple of things that I want to use as teasers for people who should watch this video. I think it was in Phila \u2013 I\u2019m almost 100 percent positive it was in Philadelphia. Aisha Tyler: Philadelphia. I think that\u2019s ri \u2013 either that or Jersey. But yeah. It was \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I think it was Philadelphia because he started ridiculing Rocky. And he said, \u201cYour hero is a fictional person,\u201d and just tearing into them. And he basically, for half of his set, just decided to abandon his material and just attack these people in the town. And \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Which, by the way, is a no-no, generally. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which is a no-no, generally. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Typically, if people hate you \u2013 there are these unwritten rules of comedy. And one of them is you don\u2019t \u2013 if some of the people in the audience hate you, don\u2019t turn all of them against you. This is just a sidebar, but don\u2019t forget what you were gonna say. There\u2019s another very famous video, very famous. And it happened at The Punchline in San Francisco where there\u2019s a guy playing \u2013 he\u2019s a guitar comic. And a guy\u2019s heckling him. And it\u2019s just combative back and forth but nothing too extreme. But then the guy gets up, and he comes towards the stage, whatever, to defend himself or the girl he\u2019s with. Something like that. And the guy just hauls off and hits him in the head with the guitar. Tim Ferriss: Sorry. Sorry. Not funny. It\u2019s tragic. But Jesus Christ. Aisha Tyler: It\u2019s spectacular. Everybody lived. But what happens is up until that beat, the whole audience has been on the comedian\u2019s side against this guy. And it is a hairpin turn from them being like, \u201cYeah, shut up,\u201d because the comic\u2019s like, \u201cHey, people can\u2019t enjoy the show because you\u2019re talking. Keep it down.\u201d And then he hits this guy, and the whole audience just turns on him, like instantaneous like Frankenstein\u2019s monster mob. Just the pitchforks come flying out. And so, one of the unwritten rules of comedy is that you wanna try to at all costs avoid turning everybody against you. So, Bill broke a bunch of rules, but he never gave up, which I think it becomes \u2013 it\u2019s like the Rudy moment at the end of the movie like, \u201cMan, that sucked. But you sure stuck in there.\u201d Tim Ferriss: And he got a standing ov \u2013 well, everybody was already standing, but he got massive applause from the audience at the end which is just \u2013 because they\u2019re just like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d It didn\u2019t even fit into any mental heuristic of comedy that they could expect. Aisha Tyler: That was straight prison yard dynamics. Nobody can know you \u2013 there\u2019s a line from Out of Sight just like the yard. \u201cNobody backing down. Nobody\u2019s backing down.\u201d I think there was probably 10,000 of them to one of him. And he just did not back down. So, he got the slow respect clap at the end of the show. Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God. So, I wasn\u2019t gonna go to heckling, but why not since we\u2019re already here? Do you have any memorable heckling stories? Or do you recall the first time you got heckled? Aisha Tyler: God, yeah. I started doing standup 25 years ago, so at this point, all the sets have just blended. And heckling can be lots of different things. It doesn\u2019t always have to be the conventional, \u201cYou suck,\u201d heckle. I had one time where this woman \u2013 and this dovetails perfectly with the old, \u201cDon\u2019t turn the audience against you,\u201d \u2013 where this woman was talking to me. She was sitting in the front row, and she was talking to me the entire show just loud enough that I could hear her but not really loud enough so the audience could hear her except for the people right around her. And it was driving me crazy. It was like a bee in my ear. And as a result, I just seemed insane because I kept stopping to yell at this person that no one could hear. And it would look like I\u2019m having a breakdown. It was a very effective heckle because she just completely derailed my show. And I just seemed like a dick because I was like, \u201cShut up, lady,\u201d but no one could hear what she was saying. So, like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? This nice lady in the front trying to enjoy the night?\u201d I remember that I really went off the rails last night. And I generally have a rule with hecklers that unless they\u2019re really disruptive to the entire room, I just never address them because what you do is you derail a show for 500 or 1,000 people to deal with one person. And everyone\u2019s never gonna really understand what\u2019s going on unless that person\u2019s so loud that they\u2019ve effected everybody else\u2019s enjoyment of the night. But sometimes the affectionate hecklers are the worse because they don\u2019t \u2013 typically, hecklers just wanna be a part of the show. And so, they say something, you slam them a little bit, they shut up because they think they\u2019re helping you out. The famous line is they\u2019ll come up and be like, \u201cHey, you like how I helped you out?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBuddy, I came with jokes. I don\u2019t need assistance.\u201d Like, \u201cI don\u2019t have a box jumper in my act, all right? I showed up ready to go.\u201d But when people are affectionate, you can\u2019t insult them. And they\u2019re the most unmanageable kind of hecklers. Tim Ferriss: Now by affectionate, you mean someone who\u2019s like, \u201cI love you. I love you.\u201d Aisha Tyler: Yeah, exactly. \u201cI love you.\u201d I had this one girl at one show in San Francisco just so drunk, just cross-eyed. And for the 90 minutes I was on stage goes, \u201cI love you. I love you so much. I love you.\u201d And I was just like, \u201cLady, all you\u2019re doing is making me want to hit you in the head with this microphone stand. Your affection is not welcome here.\u201d And everybody else is staring at this woman. But this is a genuine expression of emotion for this person that is destroying my joy completely. So, I really have a habit of just not talking to hecklers. Tim Ferriss: What did you do in that case? Did you ignore her? Aisha Tyler: I think that I kept saying, \u201cThank you. That\u2019s super sweet. Shut the fuck up.\u201d Like, \u201cClearly, you weren\u2019t hugged enough as a child.\u201d I just eventually got mean because it was just like I couldn\u2019t get this woman to stop talking. And I think the people around her got embarrassed, and they eventually shut her up which was nice. And I\u2019m trying to think if there are any other really good hecklers that \u2013 oh, I had one guy. And it\u2019s a mental discipline too because again, it\u2019s your show. You have the microphone. You\u2019re in control. I think the audience thinks they\u2019re in control, but they\u2019re not. The Bill Burr scenario is a perfect example. The person with the microphone has all the power. And as long as they cannot be moved, they will eventually win. But I had this one guy who was sitting really close to the stage. It was a group of 12 people. And they were all laughing their asses off. And then he was just arms crossed, just looked like he had just eaten a big scoop of fecal matter. And he was all I could see. The whole audience disappeared, and it was just straight vignette on this guy\u2019s sourpussed face. It was just wrecking my whole night. And I finally just said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna be here, just fucking go, man. I\u2019ll give you your money back. I cannot look at your face for one more minute.\u201d And I meant it. It wasn\u2019t even a joke. I was just like, \u201cGet out, man. You are harshing my mellow so hard.\u201d And he left. And I didn\u2019t feel bad about it. And then I went on with the show, and his girlfriend goes, \u201cHe had a bad day.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh [inaudible] \u201d But what was great was nobody else at the table wanted to leave. They were like, \u201cGood riddance to bad rubbish.\u201d And he went on, and the rest of the people enjoyed their night. But again, that was me. I should have been disciplined enough not to be distracted by old sourpuss. But I\u2019m only human. If the grinch is sitting in the front row, something must be done. Tim Ferriss: When you were just getting started, how did you get better at comedy? And what I mean by that is you\u2019re very smart. Like you mentioned, matrix capable. Did you do any type of post-game analysis? Did you watch video of yourself? Did you watch video of other comics? How did you hone your craft? Or maybe a better question is what helped the most in honing your craft? Aisha Tyler: Right. That\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s interesting. I think that there\u2019s a definite math to comedy. And then there\u2019s also a secondary ineffability. And I guess what I mean is you can learn how to be a better comic, but you can\u2019t learn how to be a comic. Or even a different way, I really wanted to be an engineer. And I could have really suffered and struggled through the elevated math that I would need to become an engineer. But it would never be effortless for me. And I think with comedy, there are people who, very workmanlike, can learn how to do comedy. And then there are some people who are just naturally comedic. And they still have to work to be better at it. Usain Bolt still has to train. Even though he was born with more fast [inaudible]\u00a0than everybody else, he still has to train to become a champion. So, I feel like with comedy, people can be the class clown. Or they can be that guy who\u2019s naturally funny. There\u2019s still a methodology, and there\u2019s still a mathematics to becoming a comic. And then at the same time, if they have this ephemeral, ineffable understanding of the math of comedy, they\u2019re gonna be able to do something magical with those skills. So, for me, I don\u2019t know that I thought I was a funny kid, but I was an observer. And I was really nerdy and a little bit of a social pariah. So, storytelling became a way to make friends. To ingratiate myself, I would try to talk my way into situations or if I was in a social situation, talk really fast to try to keep myself engaging, not be rejected. So, that was what I brought to it was that combination of being an outsider and an observer and then using those skills to try to connect with people. But with comedy, I never took any classes. I never read any books. There are definitely people who can say there\u2019s a total methodology to comedy. It\u2019s the rule of threes and stretching reality to the point of breaking but not past it. There are some specific rules. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the rule of threes? Aisha Tyler: The rule of threes is that \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Definitely maintain your train of thought. But \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Right. I probably won\u2019t even be able to articulate it properly. It\u2019s just that if you\u2019re gonna do a series of jokes or a series of builds to a punchline, it needs to be three because \u2013 and also, if you\u2019re going to do any kind of a diversion, if you\u2019re gonna lead people in one direction, then snap around to a different absurdist result, you can\u2019t do that in two. It has to be \u2013 the pace of it has to be three. And then past three, you\u2019re starting to draw things out too long. But two doesn\u2019t give people enough of a time to be lulled into a false sense of security before you pull the rug out from under them. And as soon as you start explaining the math of comedy, none of it makes any sense. It\u2019s those two things. Someone who\u2019s really gifted at physics, they know that there are rules, but still, they see things that other people can\u2019t see. They see the world as numbers and data. And the rest of us are just table, chair, water, stick. So, I guess the way that I did it was that I \u2013 I\u2019m also really an undisciplined comedian. And what I mean is \u2013 there\u2019s a documentary about Garry Shandling out right now which I haven\u2019t watched. But I\u2019m sure that this is in there because he was very famous for being a really disciplined writer. He would get up, and he would write every single day. And sometimes it would be pages of material without fail. Other comics would be like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s get a beer.\u201d He\u2019d be like, \u201cNo. I have to write.\u201d And every day he would write on this legal \u2013 this is probably true and apocryphal at the same time \u2013 on this legal lined notebook in this tiny handwriting. And he would just write and write and write and write. I do not do that. I\u2019ve never worked that way. I just get on stage. I try a bunch of stuff. I keep what works. I know what works. I already know right away what works. I\u2019ll run off stage. I\u2019ll write down the things that I knew hit. I\u2019ll write down the things I know didn\u2019t hit. And then I\u2019ll go back and try it again dropping the stuff that wasn\u2019t good and putting new stuff in. I record my sets, but I never \u2013 I cannot listen to my own voice. So, I have hours and hours of material on tape that I just have never listened to. So, I don\u2019t know why I still engage in that behavior when it\u2019s clearly not useful to me. But I think the more you do it, the more you intuitively understand, \u201cThis is a rich area. People are connecting with this. This other stuff\u2026\u201d There\u2019s also something you learn as you move through comedy which is it\u2019s not just important to get a laugh. Does this material say something specific and personal about me? Because when you\u2019re a baby comic, every joke is meaningful to you because you only have eight jokes, right? And so, even if they\u2019re stupid or juvenile or unsophisticated or valueless or coreless, you\u2019ll still do them because that\u2019s all you have. And then as you get older, you start to think, \u201cOkay. I wanna have a body of work here. Does this hang together? Does it have a strong point of view? Does it have an identity?\u201d And then those other jokes start to fall away. And then the material really becomes about trying to tell some kind of a story about yourself and the way you perceive the world. And then that\u2019s how you shape it. So, sometimes things that are really funny go away. Things that are less funny stay because they\u2019re more impactful. Does that make sense? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It does make sense. Absolutely. I think that\u2019s true for musicians. I think it\u2019s true many different artists. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Probably writers too. Probably for writers. It\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna find a space that really says something about my accumulated understanding and knowledge of the world. And it\u2019s not just enough to say something. I need to say something that\u2019s uniquely mine.\u201d And that\u2019s something you can only do by being prolific because you need to be able to let things go in order to figure out what should stay. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Yeah. There\u2019s a certain volume to it or thinking of it almost as a funnel. And I think and I certainly hope for the sake of our \u2013 not to sound like an old man, but I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m turning into \u2013 for the sake of our \u2013 Aisha Tyler: That\u2019s what we\u2019re all \u2013 we\u2019re all turning into the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Society in general. I would hope just seeing the number of hatchet jobs and the amount of yellow journalism and clickbaiting with pieces that have not been factchecked and so on and takedown pieces of folks who are otherwise doing actually a lot of good in the world but people feeling no compunction about running pieces that get a lot of clicks because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re focused on at some point go from, \u201cWhat can I write that will get the most clicks?\u201d to \u201cWhat can I write that I will be proud of that may or may not \u2013\u201d and I think you can figure out a way to make it a nonbinary decision. In other words, you can figure out something you can be proud of that is simultaneously likely to find some type of sizable audience. And I think in the beginning there\u2019s a temptation particularly if you have quit your job, and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhere\u2019s my next red check coming from?\u201d \u201cHow can I appeal to the widest number of people possible?\u201d And that\u2019s a very precarious position or mindset to put yourself into if you\u2019re hoping to do anything creatively. Evergreen. Aisha Tyler: Right. Right. And also, it\u2019s interesting. When I went to school, we had the honor system. And you were just expected to hold yourself to a high standard because that was what was right. It\u2019s just what you did. You were gonna be called upon to stand behind your work. And so, you tried to work very hard to make sure that you could defend it. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s like we\u2019re any less ethical than we\u2019ve ever been. It\u2019s just, like you said, our metrics have changed. And I think that people value fame for fame\u2019s sake rather than for the foundational reasons that people become famous. And I think that\u2019s the problem. And I don\u2019t think it just exists in journalism. I think the people value infamy. Or they can\u2019t distinguish between fame and infamy. And with a 24-hour news cycle, a bright burst is as meaningful as a slow burn. And I don\u2019t really know \u2013 I actually don\u2019t really know what we do or what should be done or what should happen to counteract that other than people start to maybe get hip to it and start rejecting baseless journalism and \u2013 it\u2019s just so hard to distin \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Let me take that back. I find it very easy to distinguish between things that seem like they\u2019ve been thoroughly vetted and things that are bullshit. But I think that people are working very hard to make it harder for the rest of us to distinguish between the two. So, without me sounding like a crazy person, there are nefarious forces at work trying to make it very hard for us to figure out what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real. And I think we have to start to raise people who are just more critical thinkers. But it\u2019s hard to be a critical thinker when you\u2019re just scrolling through your Instagram feed looking at butts and cupcakes all day long. Tim Ferriss: Have you been watching my feed? Are you looking over my shoulder? Are you one of the nefarious forces? Aisha Tyler: I\u2019m following you, and I know what you\u2019re into. I see what you\u2019re into, Tim. Tim Ferriss: Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. Oh, God. I\u2019ll admit, there was a day \u2013 and you would think supposedly being a tech investor and all this stuff for ten years that I would figure this out. There was a day when I was scrolling through cupcakes and thongs, and I looked up at my profile, and I was like, \u201cWait a minute. People can see what I follow?\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, fuck.\u201d Fortunately, I\u2019ve systematically dismantled and deliberately tarnished any semblance of any reputation I might have very deliberately so that I feel \u2013 [Crosstalk] Aisha Tyler: I wanna start interviewing you now. This is so interesting. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so that I don\u2019t feel I have any Stepford Wives, polished persona \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Yeah, any kind of perfection to maintain. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 to preserve. It\u2019s like \u2013 Aisha Tyler: That\u2019s so good. And that\u2019s so interesting to me. And it\u2019s different than just being a slob. What you\u2019re saying is, \u201cI refuse to create a box within which I will be kept by others.\u201d And I think that comes also from a curiosity about the world. I actually think that people who are trying to remain perfect all the time are fear-driven. That\u2019s not a position of strength. People think they\u2019re maintaining a position of strength when they\u2019re trying to maintain an appearance of perfection, but that is, by its very nature, a posture of fear which is, \u201cI cannot be seen to have imperfections. I cannot be seen to have flaws. There can be no chinks in my armor.\u201d And that\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m terrified of being judged.\u201d But there is something very liberating \u2013 and I think it comes from age as well and from experience. And I don\u2019t mean experience like a resume but just having experiences to realize how little you know and how the only way to learn is to constantly be skinning your knees and that that doesn\u2019t go away. The older you get, the more you know that you know very little and that you cannot learn if you are constantly trying to maintain a posture of perfection. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a total mess. Tim Ferriss: Well, if you don\u2019t practice skinning your knees \u2013 just to really bleed the metaphor for all its worth, if you don\u2019t practice skinning your knees, you\u2019re not gonna develop the callus for increasingly painful grades of sandpaper. This is really awkwardly overextended now. But the point being, if you operate from a place of fear and want to please this nebulous majority more than you want to please yourself \u2013 and that\u2019s not to say that I\u2019ve always viewed my entire life and all my decisions as a singular locust of control in the palm of my hand and I care what no one thinks. That\u2019s not true because that\u2019s not how humans have evolved. But if you are deferring to your perception of what others want on the small things, then it\u2019s gonna become harder on the medium things and then impossible. And then it\u2019s gonna become harder and impossible on the big things. And for that reason, I find it very valuable to deliberately expose yourself to different types and levels of discomfort so that you can actually stand up for the important stuff when it matters because if you don\u2019t practice on the smaller stuff \u2013 for instance, if I\u2019m so humiliated by the fact that I like gorgeous female asses, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God,\u201d and I put something up about \u2013 I put up this picture. So, this is what I do occasionally when I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know what? I think I\u2019m getting a little fat and happy and complacent. And maybe I have too much phomo or something like that. I remember at one point, I put up this photo of this gorgeous, Latin ass, female, and it said, \u201cNalgofilia.\u201d Anyway, I think it was nalgofilia. Anyway, Los nalgas is ass in Spanish. So, I put this up on Instagram. Aisha Tyler: So, it was Spanish for assman is what you\u2019re saying. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. It\u2019s famous for assman syndrome or assman disorder. And I put it up. And as to be expected, there is immediate outrage. There are plenty of people who think it\u2019s kind of funny. Plenty of people who are like, \u201cYeah, high-five.\u201d And then there are plenty of other people who are just completely outraged. Aisha Tyler: Disgusted with you. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Disgusted with this fact that I find attractive women attractive. Aisha Tyler: Yes. Outrageous contagious. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. But I left it up because I like to cull my audience, No. 1. Aisha Tyler: Yes. Yes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna be here, please. I invite you to unfollow.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah, exactly. Right. It\u2019s like the sourpuss in the front row. It\u2019s like, \u201cLet me give you a \u2013 you look like you\u2019re unhappy, but you\u2019re still here. And let me give you another reason to leave if I\u2019m not your thing because go find something that\u2019s your thing.\u201d Aisha Tyler: Yeah. People assume that their opinion is valuable to you. I think there\u2019s a freedom in saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need everybody to like me.\u201d You know what I mean? I think that there is something very meaningful in saying, \u201cThis is who I am. I\u2019ll defend it. But I\u2019m not here to be savaged by you. And honestly, we don\u2019t know each other. I don\u2019t care what you think anyway.\u201d Or maybe that person makes you think more critically about what you did, and then you take the big booty picture down. I don\u2019t know. But I think you put it up purposefully to see what you were gonna get back which was entertaining. Tim Ferriss: I totally did. Now there are cases \u2013 just so I don\u2019t sound like a complete dick. There are other cases where I put something up without really thinking about it. And I do get feedback and realize, \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s actually a really insensitive thing to put up. And I didn\u2019t think it through. Take it down.\u201d And there are cases when I do that. And people give you hopefully constructive feedback that isn\u2019t just spitting acid into my face. And I take it down. So, I do pay attention. At the same time, I try to keep in mind advice that I was given years ago. I don\u2019t remember who gave me this advice, but the advice was, \u201cIt\u2019s not about how many people don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s about how many people get it.\u201d So, as long as you have a certain critical mass, whatever that means to you \u2013 and there\u2019s an article called \u201c1,000 True Fans,\u201d by Kevin Kelly that everybody should read to this effect if you\u2019re creative. But as long as you have a critical mass \u2013 and it can be a very small number \u2013 of people who love your stuff, that\u2019s all that matters. That\u2019s a pass/fail. As long as you have that, pass. You\u2019re green. And instead of focusing on the vast majority who hate your shit, it\u2019s like, \u201cLook, there are millions of people who hate Christopher Nolan\u2019s stuff. There are millions of people who can\u2019t stand Wes Anderson.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cLook, some people just aren\u2019t going to fucking like Wes Anderson.\u201d Aisha Tyler: Exactly. Exactly. So, this is really interesting also because I think if you\u2019re an artist specifically, this is a really important conversation to have with yourself which is \u2013 when I first started, I did standup. This was the period when Def Comedy Jam was really popular. And for lack of a better way of articulating it, black comedy had a very specific look and feel and style and tempo. And I just wasn\u2019t doing that kind of comedy. And I wasn\u2019t ever going to be able to do that kind of comedy. It wasn\u2019t who I was. It wasn\u2019t experientially what I was doing. And I didn\u2019t wanna lie. And I knew there were comedians who were falling into that stylistic approach to comedy, and it was really very false. They\u2019d be one way off stage and then fall into this character on stage. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to connect with an audience. But I just didn\u2019t wanna copy other people to try to get people to like me. And for a long time, I really struggled. And then eventually, my tribe found me. But I was able to stay \u2013 oh, now I sound like a self-help book \u2013 but true to who I was because that was the only way forward. The only way forward as an artist is to be truthful. In the end, your work is not going to be interesting or meaningful if you are trying to emulate somebody else or trying to figure out what people want from you or what they like or what\u2019s popular. Meaningful art only lasts, it only connects if it\u2019s authentic and if it comes from your own personal experiences. And until you figure that out, what that is, it\u2019s never gonna be interesting. It\u2019s never going to be good. And I always tell people being funny is not really actually the most important part of comedy. Being truthful is because if someone sees a good show, they go, \u201cThat guy was really funny.\u201d But when you tell the truth about yourself, people go, \u201cOh, my God. Holy shit. That guy spoke to me or about me or was so vulnerable in that moment. That was amazing.\u201d And that\u2019s the difference between good comedy and great comedy or between good art and great art or writing or anything. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s truth. That\u2019s advice that I\u2019ve also heard for screenwriting and many other things. I\u2019m so glad you said that and reminded me of that. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. You have to please yourself. You just have to please yourself, period, because it might not go your way anyway. But the worst thing is creating some \u2013 [inaudible]\u00a0figure out what people want and then creating some piece of shit, some crass, glib, solicitous piece of shit, and people don\u2019t buy it anyway. Why not make something you love and then people don\u2019t buy it? At least it was something that you loved, and you\u2019re not embarrassed by it. Tim Ferriss: Right. And you said it may not work out. And if you\u2019re in the creative game, at least from what I\u2019ve seen, particularly in the beginning, most things are not going to work out. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Nothing ever goes your way. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, you might as well have one person who\u2019s happy about the process. Aisha Tyler: Exactly. Exactly. That was what I was saying about engagement. At least the experience was satisfying. Tim Ferriss: And I would also \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m talking too much, so I\u2019m gonna stop in a second. Aisha Tyler: No, no. [inaudible] Tim Ferriss: But the other thought I might underscore for folks that is practical, tactical from a competitive standpoint: If you\u2019re trying to play someone else\u2019s game by taking on a persona, someone who is actually \u2013 for instance, in the Def Comedy Jam example that you gave, if somebody\u2019s on stage, and they\u2019re playing their game, that is who they are, you are never going to be able to take on the cognitive load and the fatigue of pretending to be that type of person and beat someone who is good at that game. You\u2019re just not going to. Aisha Tyler: You\u2019re so right. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You\u2019re just not gonna win. So, you will not ultimately, in any field that is competitive which is effectively every field that people get paid for \u2013 if you wanna be the best, you have to harness your latent abilities, or you\u2019re fucked. You mentioned on the engineering front \u2013 there\u2019s so many places where \u2013 for instance, in writing, I could try to be John McPhee who writes for the New Yorker or one of these folks. But I can\u2019t be those people. I\u2019m not going to ever be the wordsmith that say, a Tolstoy was. But do I like teaching? Do I obsessively think about teaching and deconstructing things that are complex? I do. So, I can use books as a medium for teaching and think of it that way because if I try to be \u2013 if I try to out McPhee McPhee, I\u2019m gonna get my face ripped off. We\u2019re talking about creativity and creative pursuits which, by the way, almost everything is. If you meet people who are at the top of their game in accounting, the top of the game \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about shady money laundering shit. I\u2019m just saying in accounting, in technology, there\u2019s certainly an element of creativity, if you\u2019re looking at the people who are really at the top and innovating in any way doing exceptional work. You have done so many different things: acting, comedy, directing, writing, activism. You\u2019ve been a host. You\u2019ve done voiceover. You\u2019ve engaged in so many different acts of creation. I wanna talk about short films, films, and so on. I wanna talk about movies because as long-term listeners will know, I\u2019ve been teasing with the idea \u2013 which, by the way, just means procrastinating \u2013 of writing some short films. And I\u2019m still at step zero. And I\u2019m ashamed of that. But \u2013 Aisha Tyler: No shame. There\u2019s no shame in this \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, how did you decide to get into film? And why? Film is hard. Why do it? Aisha Tyler: It is hard. It is tough. Yeah. So, that\u2019s a really good question because I feel like there\u2019s that really humiliating clam about, \u201cWell, I\u2019m an actor. But what I really wanna do is direct.\u201d And it feels very clich\u00e9d. I feel like it was more organic for me because again, I wasn\u2019t someone who \u2013 I didn\u2019t go to film school. And I also don\u2019t think I had the hubris to think like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve done this for a couple years now. I can direct.\u201d I had written someth \u2013 I love movies. We were talking about earlier I was raised by a single dad. And I was one of those kids who I\u2019d go with my dad to see Die Hard or Road Warrior way too early in age. Super inappropriate. When I was in high school, I\u2019d seen the first Terminator something like 20 or 30 times. I just loved movies. I\u2019d go to the theater. I\u2019d buy a matinee ticket, and I\u2019d stay in the theater until 8:00 at night, and I would just watch movie after movie after movie. So, it just came out of a real end-user\u2019s love for film. I was just someone who was transported by movies. And then when I left Talk Soup, I had been writing on that show. And there was a void. And I wrote a script that I was developing with a company. And I just kept talking about how I thought it should look and how I thought it should feel. And it was just so much more specific than being a writer. And they were like, \u201cYou should direct. This is clearly a movie that you should direct.\u201d And I hadn\u2019t really thought about it. But I was just so intertwined with the material and what I wanted it to feel like because I know what movies that I love make me feel like that I wanted someone to create that experience for other people. And I just realized I didn\u2019t know what directing entailed. I didn\u2019t have any idea about what that was gonna be like. And I just went away and started trying to learn about directing. And so, I would call people that I knew that were directors. If I was working on something, I would ask to come back to set when I wasn\u2019t working so I could hang out and shadow which is where you just hang around behind a director and watch them work. And ended up shadowing with some really incredible people. I ended up spending several days on The Wire in its last season and just got to just be on the other side of a process that can be relatively opaque when you\u2019re an actor. You just show up and say your lines and leave. And then I started making shorts. And I guess this is gonna sound very glib, but \u2013 because I\u2019m sure I have the resources available to me that lots of people don\u2019t. But I do believe in \u2013 I just believe in personal aggression. I just believe in doing stuff. Tim Ferriss: You said personal aggression? Aisha Tyler: Personal aggression. I just believe that if you wanna make a movie, just start making a movie. And I don\u2019t mean go get a camera and start shooting it. But what I do mean is be hard on yourself. Learn, read, learn, watch, study, think critically, ask people questions, and then make a movie, and then let it be shitty. And then make another one. And let that one be shitty. And keep doing it until you get better at it. The first short film I made was \u2013 and it\u2019s an abomination. It will never see the light of day. I had no idea what I was doing. But that didn\u2019t make me not wanna be a director. It just made me realize I needed to learn more. And then I started to feel like I was more ready. And I was like, \u201cI need to make some stuff.\u201d So, first thing was I did a Comedy Central special, and I took the money that would have been my salary, and I used it to make a little short music video that opens the comedy special. It wasn\u2019t anything that was mandated by the network. I was like, \u201cI wanna do something different.\u201d So, I wrote the song, and I performed it. And I made a music video. And that was the first thing I directed. I just used the crew that was already working on the special and shot this video with them. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s really smart. So, I would imagine \u2013 not to interject \u2013 but you piggybacked on something that was in your main line of business, so to speak. Aisha Tyler: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And I imagine you saved a lot of costs by doing that, right? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. The crew was already gonna come up the day before and leave the day after to shoot the special. And we\u2019d already rented the cameras and everything like that. But I still had to pay them for the extra work. I just took my fee, and I used it to pay everybody else. And then because I didn\u2019t have any more money after that, I learned how to edit. And I edited it myself. And I delivered it to the network because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay for additional edit time. And then after that I thought, \u201cOkay. I wanna do more of this.\u201d So, then I rented a camera. I rented a can of 5D. And I had some friends who were in bands. And again, it sounds fancy, but everybody probably knows somebody who does something. Just because I had some friends who were in a famous band doesn\u2019t mean that people out there don\u2019t have friends who are in bands. So, I just called some buddies of mine that were in bands. And I said, \u201cHey, if you let me come on tour with you, I will make you a free music video. Just a piece of fan art. You can use it however you like. I\u2019m not gonna charge anybody any money for it. But I wanna make something, and I wanna make something for you.\u201d And so, I ended up going on the road with Silversun Pickups for a couple of dates and then spending a day with Clutch when they were performing in Anaheim. And then I just gave them \u2013 I just cut music videos and delivered it to them. And so, then I just started to have examples of what I could do. Tim Ferriss: Why music videos instead of something else? Aisha Tyler: It just felt like a way to get more people to see it. I had done that first music video for my Comedy Central special which was really a comedic video. But then I was like, \u201cOh, I really like working in this space.\u201d And a lot of directors come out of music video because you can be radically creative in that space. You don\u2019t need to have any narrative linearity. You can experiment. You can be radical. It could just be a series of images. And I also thought, \u201cWell, people who like this band \u2013 and I love this band \u2013 will wanna see something about them. And it\u2019ll be a great way for people to see something. And then hopefully, I can tell a story at the same time.\u201d And so, I did three of those. And then I did a little action short. I just kept making stuff. Every time I did it, I learned something. Or every time I did it, I took a bigger risk, creatively. Tim Ferriss: How long are these shorts? Aisha Tyler: Like three to five minutes. Tim Ferriss: Three to five minutes. Can you think of any particular lessons that you took away from any one of those? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. I think a lot of it was just skill building like, \u201cHow do you frame up? And how do you make choices? And how do you do coverage? And then how do you edit?\u201d A lot of it was just really practical \u2013 as you would say, practical, tactical.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. I have my pet phrases. This is also my weakness. Aisha Tyler: I remember I heard that. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna steal it. Stealing it from Tim.\u201d Tim Ferriss: My pet phrases. Oh, God. Aisha Tyler: And then a lot of it was just getting confident with my own ability and my ability to articulate what I wanted from other people. Just, \u201cHow do the other jobs on a set work? Who does what? What do I need? Oh, God. This didn\u2019t work. You know why it didn\u2019t work? Because I didn\u2019t have this kind of a person on set.\u201d I was shooting digitally. And then on one show, on one of my things that I shot, we didn\u2019t have a tech on set to help me make sure that it looked the way that I wanted it to look, that the levels were set properly. So, when I got home to edit it, I had some problems. But they weren\u2019t catastrophic problems because I wasn\u2019t making Star Wars. I was just able to be like, \u201cWell this is what it is. And I\u2019m gonna make this and move on. And then I was getting ready to do \u2013 I really wanted to do a feature. I had some material I\u2019d written, but it was gonna be an expensive movie. But I was still shadowing. So, I had a friend who had a show called Penny Dreadful, John Logan who created Penny Dreadful. I had met him at Comic Con. I had hosted the panel for that show. And he was like, \u201cHey, you love the show. You should come visit us in Ireland.\u201d And I remember thinking to myself, \u201cPeople always say that. Then you always say, \u2018Yeah,\u2019 then you never do it.\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna do it. I\u2019m fucking going to Ireland, man. I\u2019m gonna be cool. I\u2019m gonna be the cool kid for once in my life.\u201d And so, I ended up going over, visiting Penny Dreadful. And Vikings shot right up the road. So, I got them to let me visit that set. I just hung out and passed out sandwiches and lifted stuff and asked questions and watched them work. And then while I was over there, I met a bunch of Irish actors. And two of them actually \u2013 one was an actor, composer, and one was a screenwriter and an actor. And we ended up making a short film together in Ireland at the end of 2014. That was my first narrative short, my first story driven short. And it was just great. I was like, \u201cOh, this is totally who I am. This is what I wanna do with my life.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Where did you film in Ireland? Do you recall? Aisha Tyler: In Galway which is \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Beautiful town. Aisha Tyler: \u2013 coast. Yeah. Such a great place. Tim Ferriss: I lived there for a month in 2005. Aisha Tyler: Oh, did you? Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Aisha Tyler: Amazing. Oh, that\u2019s so cool. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. An incredible arts festival there. It\u2019s a really beautiful spot. Aisha Tyler: Yeah, it is. It\u2019s like the arts center of Ireland. They\u2019ve got a beautiful film festival in the summer. They\u2019ve got an arts festival with local theater. It was just a great experience. And things went wrong, and things went right. But we got it in the can in three days. And it was just super cool and personal. And then that same writer who had written that short had a feature he had already written. And he asked me if I wanted to take a look at it. And it was just a perfect first film. And that\u2019s the film that became AXIS. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, I want to dig into AXIS. But before we get to that, you\u2019re taking these trips, doing these music videos. During that period, did you save up for that period knowing that you would need to work out of your savings? Are you depending on royalties and other streams to pay your bills? How are you covering the necessities of life as you are handing out sandwiches and doing all these various things? Aisha Tyler: Well, it wasn\u2019t as prolonged of a period as it sounds like. I was on hiatus. So, I was working on The Talk at the time. And we get a month off every year. So, I went in that month. But I think if I was talking to a layperson who didn\u2019t work in television, I would say, \u201cIf what you want is to grow in whatever field you\u2019re interested in, just create a space for that. Make that your vacation.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like I was riding around in a limousine. I just flew over, and I hung around for a week and watched people work. And it wasn\u2019t any more or less burdensome than taking a vacation. But one thing I was more interested in doing as I got older \u2013 and we started with this in the beginning. You said it, and I think we went past it. But it\u2019s so interesting to me \u2013 was that I just really wanted more discomfort in my life. It\u2019s just very easy the older you get to be like, \u201cGet in car. Go to work. Eat bagged lunch. Get in car. Go to gym. Go home. Eat food. Watch TV. Go to bed.\u201d And then you just think, \u201cAm I growing? Is any of this interesting? I have one life, and I\u2019m just spending it in this torpor.\u201d And so, for that, I was going to a place where \u2013 I knew one guy at Penny Dreadful, but I didn\u2019t know anybody at this other show. And I just cold called them and said, \u201cCan I come visit?\u201d And they were super gracious. And \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Just to interrupt you yet again, what does that email say? Aisha Tyler: It says, \u201cHi.\u201d And again, I understand that maybe this is gonna feel a little rarified. \u201cHi. I\u2019m an American actress. I\u2019ve worked on these shows. I\u2019ve been shadowing to direct for a long time. I would be really grateful if I could come and visit your show for a few days and shadow. And I will be as unobtrusive and invisible as I possibly can. And I\u2019ll be here these days. And I understand if you can\u2019t accommodate me, but I\u2019d really be grateful.\u201d And I think it helped in my particular case because I had tweeted a lot about how much I loved Vikings. So, they knew that I was a big fan of the show. And I did some tweeting from set. I paid my way in flacking their show for them. But \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not over-caffeinated. I swear to God. You\u2019re making so many important points that I just want to pause and help \u2013 well, as much for myself as anyone else. Just people to reflect on. So, what you did in terms of tweeting, people might say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a verified account. And nobody\u2019s gonna pay attention to one tweet in the Twitter feed of 10,000 if it\u2019s a popular TV show.\u201d But I can tell you from personal experience that you could, for instance, write something for a medium or for fill-in-the-blank outlet that has a high Google \u2013 in other words, page rank, and that many of the producers, actors, and so on will have Google alerts or other alerts set that deliver to their inboxes relevant media that mentions say, the show or the actors. And you do not need to be a famous actress or an author or any of those things to do that. Aisha Tyler: All you need to do is work at the highest possible caliber of quality that you can. I think you also touched on this about the idea that people are more interested in being expeditious than they are in being good. I think that this holds very, very true for this business. A lot of people have made headway because they did something that nobody saw. But when people asked them what they did, the thing they were able to show was extraordinary. And I don\u2019t mean expensive extraordinary. I just mean unique and personal and crafted with care. And so, if that\u2019s something that you wrote or if it\u2019s something that you made \u2013 this is not the best example, but it\u2019s a good one. 20 years ago, there was this videotape going around Hollywood of these guys in an apartment. And it was a VHS tape. That\u2019s how long ago it was. And people were dubbing it and giving it to friends of these guys in an apartment. It was these three black guys where the one guy goes up and hits the little intercom and goes, \u201cWazza?\u201d And then the other guy goes, \u201cWazza?\u201d And the third guy \u2013 that was a short film that some guy made on a digital camera. None of them were famous. They were just some guys in New York. That ended up being that Budweiser campaign. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s crazy. I had no idea that was the origin. Aisha Tyler: It was a short film. And it was a two and a half minute short film that was just funny. We didn\u2019t know these guys. No one knew who they were. And they didn\u2019t have any connections. And I think it was just about doing something that felt original and personal. And I get it. It just comes back to don\u2019t try to figure out what people want. Just do what\u2019s interesting and important to you. And then keep doing it until you come up with something extraordinary. And that will be your calling card. It may not happen as fast as you want or as aggressively as you want or as expansively as you want. But in the meantime, you\u2019re doing cool shit which should be your primary goal in any event. When I made AXIS, honestly, I just wanted to make a movie to show people I could make a movie. I wanted to make the best movie I could. And I was very rigorous in leveraging the resources that I had to the best of my ability. But I don\u2019t know that I had a lot of expectation that a lot of people would see it. It\u2019s just because I made the best movie I could that it got all of this attention. But I don\u2019t think I was going in like, \u201cThis is gonna be a massive hit.\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make this little movie. And then to the next one, when people say, \u2018Well, what have you done?\u2019 I can be like, \u2018Look at this little thing I made.\u2019\u201d So, I think you have to always be focused on the thing and not the result because the result is directly tied to the quality of the thing. So, it\u2019s not about infamy. It\u2019s about fame. And fame is based on the quality of your work. So, just be doing excellent shit all the time. And eventually, one of those things will connect with other people. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Not to sound like a fortune cookie on top of all of that, but the only uncrowded market is great. There\u2019s always a fucking market for great. And \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Exactly. And \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Go ahead. Aisha Tyler: Radically too. Be radically great. Don\u2019t be like, \u201cI saw ten things like this. Let me do the 11th thing.\u201d Be brave enough to court failure. That\u2019s probably when you\u2019re going to do something great. Tim Ferriss: Absolutely. And if you are really in love with something \u2013 I\u2019ll give two examples. If you\u2019re really in love with, say, screenplays and film, or if you\u2019re really in love and passionate about \u2013 maybe is a better word \u2013 possessed by technology investing, early stage technology investing, two phenomena, two companies at this point, certainly that are worth looking at and just investigating the stories of demonstrate very clearly what you can do if you are just rejected by the establishment or if you want to not operate within the existing power structure. And so, the two examples are The Black List. Look up Franklin Leonard and The Black List. Aisha Tyler: Oh, God. Yeah. That\u2019s a terrific example. Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: And then the second is \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to get into both of these right now. The second is \u2013 just by coincidence also has the list at the end \u2013 but AngelList and Naval Ravikant. And people can look up the \u2013 well, \u201cThe Avenging Angel\u201d was the title of his interview in his alumni magazine at Dartmouth, in fact. But I get excited when I hear these types of stories. So, they should check them out. So, let\u2019s come back to AXIS. What is AXIS? And did you have anybody try to talk you out of doing AXIS? Aisha Tyler: Oh, that\u2019s such a good question. So, AXIS is a thriller about an ex-patriot Irish actor living in Los Angeles who has had a lot of success, explosive success in his youth and has really just used all of his resources to just wreck his life. He\u2019s a drunk, and he\u2019s a drug addict. And he\u2019s terrible at relationships. And he\u2019s a dick to everybody. And when we meet him, he\u2019s trying to turn his life around. And it\u2019s really about a guy who\u2019s not a bad person, but he\u2019s done some bad stuff, which I think almost every human being can relate to. We all have a little bit of a demon inside of us. And I think this is just a guy who\u2019s been \u2013 he\u2019s been frail in the past, but he\u2019s really trying to be a better version of himself. But slowly, over the course of an afternoon \u2013 and the movie takes place in real time as he\u2019s driving through Los Angeles, his life starts to unravel. And it\u2019s really about him trying to hold things together, trying to be a better person, trying to be a better person in his relationships with his family, with the people that he works with, just trying to be better. It\u2019s really dark. It\u2019s very funny. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get some letters about this. But I happen to find that addicts are really entertaining people. And I don\u2019t mean their funny like laugh at them. I find that typically people who have broken themselves down are just more honest than people who are trying to be perfect all the time. And so, he\u2019s a guy who\u2019s self-aware. He\u2019s aware of the mistakes he\u2019s made. So, it\u2019s a very darkly funny movie. And then it\u2019s very twisty. It\u2019s a thriller, so it\u2019s got a lot of secrets. And the most unique aspect of the movie is that the whole thing takes place in real time inside a car as he\u2019s driving through Los Angeles. So, the lead actor is the only actor on screen. And all the other actors are voice actors on the phone with him. Tim Ferriss: How would you describe your experience of being involved with this film? Aisha Tyler: It was so wonderful. You asked if people tried to dissuade me from doing it, and the short answer is in Hollywood, the way that people dissuade you from doing stuff is just by not helping you, by not engaging with you because you don\u2019t even get, \u201cNo.\u201d You just get silence. But this happened very quickly. So, I didn\u2019t have a traditional discouraging period of frustration with trying to put this movie together because I read it in August or September of 2015. And I was at peak engagement at that time in terms of work. I was on four shows. And I really only had a little bit of time off in 2016. And I realized if I didn\u2019t make the movie in this one single week in May of 2016 that I wasn\u2019t gonna be able to make it at all in that year and I\u2019d have to push to the next year. And so, then it just became about hitting that target like, \u201cHow can I hit this target?\u201d So, I never even went the traditional way of trying to find people to finance the movie and a studio because they were gonna say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know who this actor is. He\u2019s unknown. Can we put somebody famous in this role? Can it be Ryan Gosling? Can it not be with just him on camera? Can we have other actors in the movie? And then can we make it not in a car? Can we make it \u2013\u201d the whole concept of the film was gonna unravel. That\u2019s very typical in Hollywood where people are so risk-averse that they take all of the edge and singularity out of a project. So, very quickly I realized that I was gonna have to probably crowdfund the movie if I wanted to do it my way and on my timeframe. So, in March of 2016 I had my first exploratory conversation with the people around me and with Kickstarter. I was able to \u2013 they have people over there who are around to help you figure out how to put a project together. I built the campaign in three weeks. I launched it in April. And one of the rules about crowdfunding and Kickstarter, specifically \u2013 it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule. It\u2019s not a rule that they enforce. But it\u2019s just a rule of thumb \u2013 that if you raise half of your money in the first week, you\u2019ll probably fund fully. So, we had raised half of our money in that first week, and then I started hiring people on the film. And we did raise a lot of money for a feature. It was about $200,000.00 that we raised. And so, that was what we had to make the movie. So, originally, we were gonna make it nine days. But I realized if I made it faster, I\u2019d have more money available to me daily. My daily resource load would be higher. So, we cut the schedule from nine days to seven days which is incredibly aggressive for a feature. Whenever I tell people I made it in seven days they ask, \u201cIs it a short?\u201d So, we had to be really aggressive. We ended up doing it in this way that was so terrifying and so breakneck but so exhilarating which is that we shot the first 15 pages of the movie in the first day. And then we shot the next 65 pages of the movie. We shot about 17 pages on the first day and about 67 pages on day two through seven. And that meant that the actor had to do 67 pages of dialogue a day. For people that don\u2019t know, typically, on a movie you do between three and six pages of dialogue a day. So, he was essentially doing the entire movie all the way through every day locked in a hot car with no air conditioning in May, beginning of June, essentially in Los Angeles. And it was just so intense. But we shot three cameras. So, by day three, we essentially had the entire movie in the can because we were doing the whole thing all the way through from three angles. So, by day two, we had six angles. And we had the whole movie on \u2013 not on wax. On the digital version of wax. And so, then the next four days were just about creative play. And I think that what the result is is I made a movie in a week. It\u2019s experimental. It\u2019s unusual. It\u2019s transporting and strange. And going in, I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never make a movie this way again.\u201d But now I would make a movie that way again because I just didn\u2019t have any time to be afraid or feel doubt. There was no time to be anxious. I just had to go. It was wonderful. It was one of the seminal experiences of my life. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s definitely some magic in the ether when you have a hyper aggressive deadline. There\u2019s just something that happens to the spacetime continuum and what you can achieve when everything gets compressed that intensely. Aisha Tyler: Certain things just come to the surface. Certain things are thrown into relief. And it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t make mistakes, but I think you get a clarity sometimes because you can\u2019t dither. There\u2019s no time for paralysis by analysis. I am making this decision. I\u2019m making it definitively. It may be the wrong one, but I\u2019m gonna lean all the way into it, and we\u2019re gonna see what happens. And also because we shot the whole movie all the way through, if there were errors, I had the next day to recalibrate in a way that you don\u2019t get when you typically make a movie. For people, again, who don\u2019t know, on a \u2013 I\u2019m an actor as well. So, when I\u2019m on a TV show or I\u2019m doing a movie or whatever, I\u2019ll leave at the end of the day and go, \u201cOh, shit, man. I wish I\u2019d done this with that scene. I wish I\u2019d tried this.\u201d But every day, the next day, we got to wake up and go, \u201cYou know what? We have a whole new bite at this apple. We\u2019re gonna do it a whole different way today.\u201d And so, at the end, I really felt like we really, fully explored the material which we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do if we had been making a movie in seven days and not doing it with this volume approach that we had. Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019m looking at text in a book that you contributed to. Happens to be this \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Is it a book \u2013 Tribe of Men? Tim Ferriss: This fantastic book. Oh, let me see. Here it is. For those of you who get the \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: For those of you who get the What about Bob? reference, \u201cThere\u2019s this groundbreaking new book. Oh, yes. Here it is.\u201d And there\u2019s an entire shelf of the therapist\u2019s own book, Richard Dreyfuss. In any case, the question to what you would put on a gigantic billboard, metaphorically speaking to get a message to millions or billions of people, in this case, what you selected was a Jack Canfield quote. \u201cEverything you want is on the other side of fear.\u201d And many of the stories that you\u2019ve told so far illustrate that, certainly. What are you afraid of now? Or what fear are you hoping, say, in the next year to get on the other side of? Does anything come to mind? Aisha Tyler: That\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s interesting because I think the one that feels the most obvious is I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t get to make another film. But I\u2019m not really, legitimately afraid of that because I feel like I\u2019m just gonna put this next movie together and make it. I think now that I\u2019ve done one with no help and no assistance from anybody, the next one\u2019s gonna be cake. I had help. I had my team. But I didn\u2019t have the traditional Hollywood help where I had a team of agents making magic. It was really just a scrappy little group of filmmakers doing this film with me, the lead actor and screenwriter and my creative executives. It was a small group of people completely outside of the system. But what am I afraid of? God, that\u2019s a really good \u2013 and it\u2019s not that I\u2019m fearless. It may just be that the things that are interesting to me now don\u2019t engender fear the way that they used to. Tim Ferriss: I can also I think tackle this from a different angle which is what is one of your greatest struggles right now? What do you struggle with? Aisha Tyler: Oh, God. Tim Ferriss: If anything? Aisha Tyler: My main struggle is just always being as effective as I wanna be. You know what I mean? I\u2019m just super ambitious. I have highly developed \u2013 I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m good at it. I mean it\u2019s very far advanced workaholism. I have pathological workaholism. It\u2019s a sickness. And whenever I say I\u2019m a workaholic, people always laugh. And I go, \u201cLook, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to rest. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like to play. I do like play. But I don\u2019t think I have any time to rest. And I worry that it makes me \u2013 it could result in me not being an interesting artist because I think you need to play and to daydream and to rest and to experience things to be able to tell interesting stories. And no one wants to hear about your daily trek from your home to your office. It\u2019s just not compelling. Tim Ferriss: Well, I remember \u2013 I think it was Amanda Palmer who said this. I apologize to whoever said it if I\u2019m misattributing. But Amanda Palmer, creative musician extraordinaire. Oh, God. I think it was her who said, \u201cIn order to have \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Is she married to Neil Gaiman? Tim Ferriss: She is. Yeah. Aisha Tyler: Greatest author of all time? Okay. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Exactly. For those of you \u2013 [Crosstalk] Aisha Tyler: After you, Tim. After you and after me, then him. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. I will bow at the feet of Neil Gaiman as a writer. And everybody should listen to his audiobook of The Graveyard Book narrated by him. He has also the most soothing voice imaginable. But I digress. What the fuck was I saying? Aisha Tyler: Oh, so Amanda Palmer has a quote about \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Oh, yes. \u201cIf art imitates life, in order to create art, you have to have a life.\u201d Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: And I\u2019m paraphrasing. And it\u2019s butchered. But makes a point. Aisha Tyler: But like a radical one. I\u2019m sure there are other theories. There\u2019s a very famous French writer. It\u2019s not [inaudible]\u00a0but it\u2019s somebody anyway about have a bourgeois life and be radical in your work. But I actually don\u2019t think \u2013 and I actually think that you need to be fully engaged in your life in order to be an interesting artist because you need to be alive to be able to speak about the human condition. Tim Ferriss: So, if you have advanced early onset workaholism, you\u2019ve really turned this into a default mode, are you doing anything to try and manage that or create more slack in the system for the daydreaming and so on? Aisha Tyler: That\u2019s my daily practice. That\u2019s my one day at a time. It\u2019s just constantly trying to remind myself to rest. I engage socially a lot more than I used to. Tim Ferriss: And by socially, you mean out in the real world? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Out in the real world. I go out. And I try to not just be \u2013 I just had a period of life where I was just up, gym, work, sleep. I just remember one day I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna die. I\u2019m gonna die of boredom. I bore myself.\u201d You know what I mean? And so, I think I try to court danger in a safe way. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m jumping out of a plane with no parachute or bullfighting or bareknuckle brawling in an alley filled with needles. But I am trying to just not always have my head in my computer. But look, the reason that people are workaholics \u2013 well, there\u2019s lots of reasons I\u2019m sure. Social pressures. But for me, I just get this big serotonin release. Is it serotonin? What\u2019s the satisfaction drug? Is it serotonin? Tim Ferriss: I would say dopamine, perhaps. Aisha Tyler: Dopamine. That\u2019s it. Dopamine. Serotonin\u2019s sleepy time. Yeah. Dopamine. I get a dopamine release when I complete tasks. And I get higher and higher the more that I execute. I find executing in and of itself really enjoyable. So, I\u2019m just trying to apply that aggression to leisure like, \u201cCan I get the same satisfaction from \u2013 if I make a to-do list and one of the things is \u2018have fun,\u2019 will I get the same dopamine release if I have a lot of fun?\u201d Tim Ferriss: How can I turn fun into work most effectively? Aisha Tyler: Yeah, and then be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know about you guys, but I just fucking crushed my to do list. What?\u201d I realize that even though I can feel very harried, it\u2019s interesting to me to be feeling like a part of being on this planet is fully engaging and doing everything I can do and everything I\u2019m interested in because I don\u2019t wanna look back and be like, \u201cMan, I should have tried that.\u201d I\u2019m happy to look back and say, \u201cMan, I tried that, and it went terribly for me.\u201d That\u2019s a perfectly comfortable space for me to be like, \u201cMan, I tried that. And I completely shit the bed.\u201d But what I find very uncomfortable is the idea that I always wanted to do something and I never did it. And so, that\u2019s what I fear. What I fear is not trying, not experiencing all the things that I wanna experience. Tim Ferriss: How do you think you \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. How do you think your life \u2013 because you live so aggressively. You milk the most out of the hours that you have. How would you or your life be different if you didn\u2019t have exercise as an element do you think? Aisha Tyler: Well, it\u2019s interesting because I really love working out. But there\u2019s a constant battle for me between being effective with work and \u2013 I\u2019m the queen of getting up at 5:00 a.m. to work out, putting on my workout clothes and then being in front of my computer at 4:00 in the afternoon and I haven\u2019t moved. That\u2019s just a normal day. Didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t eat. Didn\u2019t do anything. Just been in front of the computer for 11 hours. But it\u2019s just such a great stress manager. And I also think that there\u2019s another thing there which is it just, again, puts you back in your body, this thing that\u2019s carrying your brain around and making you effective. I think that with everything, all of the stimuli that we experience nowadays, all of the pictures and the images of perfection that are coming in at a much faster and more voluminous pace, it\u2019s really easy to fall into an abusive relationship with exercise, either doing it so much that you\u2019re hurting yourself or not doing it and then engaging in that inner monologue about how you\u2019re worthless and you can\u2019t get your shit together. And I don\u2019t have either of those things. I just know I\u2019m happier and better when I work out. But I don\u2019t do \u2013 I\u2019ve finally dropped the monologue about I\u2019m not a good person if I don\u2019t crush a workout. I just try to do it every day because I know I\u2019m better mentally. And I also cheat completely. I have my phone. I took a hike today. I had my phone with me, and I stopped every ten minutes to write something down. So, I\u2019m not really fully in. I\u2019m not being in the moment when I\u2019m working out. A lot of times, I\u2019m stopping hundreds of times to make notes and remind myself of stuff I have to do or put stuff on my calendar. Tim Ferriss: Do you still use Concept2 or a rowing machine? Aisha Tyler: I still use my ergometer, my Concept2 ergometer. I have had it since 2000. It is 18 years old. I have never had to repair it or replace any parts. It\u2019s the single best piece of equipment that I have. I have my whole gym in my place. I have a TRX body weight system. I have to kettlebells, a 25 and a 35. I have my ergometer. I have battle ropes that are attached to my dining room table. And I have one big power step that I just use to do pistols and stuff like that. And I get everything done with those five things. Tim Ferriss: That is fantastic. So, pistols, for people who don\u2019t know, those are one-legged squats. And they can be very, very difficult depending on how you go about it. Aisha Tyler: Yes. But a bench or a step can help you because you can just do single leg stepdowns until you build up your quad and your glute strength to do pistols. Tim Ferriss: Could you describe for us a recent workout or what a prototypical of yours might look like? Aisha Tyler: Well, I hiked today. That was just a 90 minute hike which was just more about feeling groovy. But right now, I\u2019m obsessed with my ergometer. I go through periods of not rowing and then periods of rowing really aggressively. And this is gonna be right up your alley, Tim. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m ready. Aisha Tyler: This is like bullseye for you and your audience. I started going to a naturopath. So, I\u2019ve been supplementing differently. And I started taking glutathione. And I\u2019m rowing faster now than I did in my 20s. I just keep getting personal bests on my rower. It\u2019s confusing. I\u2019m a lot older than I was when I was rowing competitively. And I just keep knocking 30 seconds and then 45 seconds and then a minute and ten seconds off my rowing time. So, now I\u2019m just obsessed with hitting personal bests every time I row. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Let\u2019s dig into this. So, the glutathione, how is it \u2013 for those who aren\u2019t familiar, glutathione is thought of \u2013 a simple way to think of it or the way it\u2019s often described is as a master antioxidant of sorts. How are you having it administered? Is it being inj \u2013 Aisha Tyler: God. Oh, this is so inside baseball. Sometimes I get IVs. I get IVs if I\u2019m wrecked, if I traveled a lot or if I went to Coachella. Tim Ferriss: And is that pure \u2013 is that just glutathione? Or are you doing that at the \u2013 Aisha Tyler: No. I get B vitamins. I could do it at the end of my IV. I\u2019ll get B vitamins and just \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: And a glutathione push at the end or something? Aisha Tyler: Yeah, exactly. But you can get fat soluble glutathione that you just gulp down. It takes like axle grease. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Wait. What is this company? It\u2019s Lypo-Spheric. That\u2019s the name. Lypo-Spheric glutathione. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. It\u2019s the Lypo-Spheric glutathione. Yeah. And I\u2019m just contributing it to the glutathione because before the glutathione, I was rowing slow. And now I\u2019m just like a jackrabbit. So, it could be something else. But I\u2019m gonna say it\u2019s the glutathione. Tim Ferriss: I will warn people in advance. I had some of this Lypo-Spheric glutathione at one point. And I gave it to a friend of mine. And I think it might have been \u2013 for those who know my buddy Kevin Rose, since I like to mention him, even misattribute things to him just for fun. I think I gave him one, and he said something like, \u201cWhat is this? Horse semen?\u201d It does have a weird \u2013 it has a very weird consistency. Aisha Tyler: No, my father calls it axel grease. He\u2019s like, \u201cGive me this axel grease,\u201d because I gave it to my dad. I was like, \u201cI think this would really help you.\u201d And you\u2019re supposed to take it in liquid, but he\u2019s just been eating it on a spoon. He\u2019s a better man than I. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I just squeegee it out of the little packet with my \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Into your mouth? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, into my mouth. Aisha Tyler: I take it with about two ounces of kombucha in the morning so I don\u2019t have to think about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You\u2019re smarter. Aisha Tyler: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re like this. Or maybe after all of that experimentation on yourself, you just get up and have a bowl of Frosted Flakes in the morning, Tim. But it\u2019s like I do that. And then I have my bowl of supplements. And then I have my fish oil. And then I have my curcumin. And then I have my turmeric. And by the end of the morning, I\u2019ve supplemented a banquet. I don\u2019t even need to eat, I\u2019ve taken so many crappy tablets. Tim Ferriss: All right. Just to hit pause again. So, is the exercise before breakfast? Is it the first thing you do? What is the first \u2013 ideal morning, what\u2019s the first 60 to 90 minutes look like? Aisha Tyler: Espresso shot, glutathione, work out. Tim Ferriss: What time do you wake up? Aisha Tyler: It depends on the day. Between 6:00 and 7:00. I used to wake up a lot earlier, but I let one of my shows go, so I don\u2019t have to wake up at the crack of dawn every day anymore. So, it\u2019s between 6:00 and 7:00. But I have to work out in the morning or I won\u2019t work out at all. Tim Ferriss: So, you wake up. You have espresso shot, glutathione with \u2013 Aisha Tyler: I always have coffee before I work out without fail. Tim Ferriss: And then the glutathione with the kombucha. Any particular type of kombucha that\u2019s your preferred axel grease mixer? Aisha Tyler: I like Better Booch. And I like \u2013 what is it? LIFEAID I think is one of the other \u2013 I love kombucha. I\u2019m very slutty when it comes to kombucha. I\u2019ll drink any kombucha. I\u2019m a big kombucha fan. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, then you buckle down to work out. And this is gonna sound like I\u2019m just looking for opportunities to plug, which maybe I am. But you described one of your workouts, the Concept2 mid-distance 5k rows punctuated by short distance 2k hit sprints, high intensity interval training with a 10k long distance row once or twice a week. Would that be a current workout? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. That\u2019s typically my workouts. And then I\u2019ll do a set of five by 25 kettlebells. I\u2019ll get up in the morning and just do 125 kettleball swings in front of the television. And then sometimes I\u2019ll do a TRX workout because I didn\u2019t have really a way to simulate pullups. So, that was why I got the TRX so I could do \u2013 that was the one thing I didn\u2019t have in here was a pullup bar. Tim Ferriss: Is the TRX attached to a door? Is it \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Yeah. It\u2019s essentially like a railing. I have an upstairs railing, and it just hangs off of the railing. Tim Ferriss: Got it. And \u2013 Aisha Tyler: And that\u2019s it. I try to keep it relatively simple so that I\u2019ll do it. I don\u2019t really train with anybody because I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can manage the hour workout, but I can\u2019t manage the transit between my home and a \u2013 I don\u2019t have enough time to do that too. I\u2019ve got the hour. I don\u2019t have two hours. So, I don\u2019t go to a gym anymore because I just would be \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have the time for it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. The transit time. That \u2013 Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Transit time was what killed me. It was like, \u201cI have an hour to work out. But I don\u2019t have a half hour on either side of that to go to the gym. Tim Ferriss: Do you still watch shows when you row? Aisha Tyler: Totally. Totally. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Any recent favorites? Or what are you watching currently? Aisha Tyler: Just fantastic junk. Some good stuff. I watch The Walking Dead, Fear the Walking Dead. Those are always really good workout shows. Right now, I\u2019m watching The Magicians during my workouts. And then when I finish that, what will I watch after that? Sometimes I watch stuff that\u2019s on streaming services because I hate to have to \u2013 when I\u2019m rowing, I don\u2019t wanna have to watch commercials. And I can\u2019t stop to fast-forward because I\u2019m trying to beat my previous row time. So, I\u2019ll stream stuff on Hulu like X-Files or Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Or I just watched a show called Deutschland 83. That was pretty great. It has to be something that I can kind of watch which is why I\u2019ll typically watch something that\u2019s not too mentally demanding. So, I can\u2019t pay attention too closely to plot points. Tim Ferriss: Right. Do you make New Year\u2019s resolutions? Do you have any routines or rituals around New Year\u2019s? Just for people who may be listening to this at another time, we\u2019re chatting at the end of March. Aisha Tyler: Like, did I make any this year? Tim Ferriss: Right. Aisha Tyler: I make the same one every year which is to rest more. It\u2019s the same resolution every year. Rest. Rest. Rest. Tim Ferriss: So, how are you gonna do that this time? Aisha Tyler: I don\u2019t know. I should just give up. I should stop making resolutions. And then I won\u2019t have to not have not accomplished them. Look, maybe a part of success or success at being you, figuring out being you is understanding what your strengths and your weaknesses are. My strength is my aggressive work ethic. When I was a young comic, I would be like, \u201cOh, I should be writing every day. I should write. I should be like this guy.\u201d Well, that\u2019s just not how I operate. So, I think once you accept what your own methodology of what it is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: This is why you watched The Terminator 30 times. You\u2019re like, \u201cThis is my people.\u201d Right. Aisha Tyler: Yes. So, I definitely have OCD. I\u2019m definitely an obsessive personality. But once you accept, \u201cThese are my strengths. This is where I excel. This is how I excel \u2013\u201d rather than try to force yourself into someone else\u2019s workflow, figure out what yours is. As a writer \u2013 and you\u2019ve written lots of books. I\u2019ve only written two. But with both books, I had this huge lead time. And it wasn\u2019t that I was lazy or procrastinating. The book wasn\u2019t there yet. And then just one day, the book was there. And then I sat down, and I wrote the entire book in a few weeks. But it just needed to gel. It needed to synthesize. And if I had been trying to sit down and write a little bit every day, it would have just been this big agglomeration of glob. But just one day, I was like, \u201cOh, the book is in me now. The book is in me.\u201d And then I got it out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. I wish I had that experience. Man, I\u2019m so jelly. Aisha Tyler: Oh, but everybody\u2019s different. Do you know what I mean? For a long time, I would have wanted to be more like you, disciplined and sitting down because there\u2019s a panic that ensues when you are seven weeks from your deadline and you had nine months to write a book, and now you gotta write the whole thing. But for me, certain threads have to connect. And that requires rumination and time. And I just can\u2019t do it any other way. So, I don\u2019t. Tim Ferriss: I think my strength is every day trying to eat a wheelbarrow full of glass and shit out diamonds or something like that. Aisha Tyler: Oh, man. That\u2019s a good one. That should be a tattoo. Tim Ferriss: Well, speaking of eating glass, so I wanted \u2013 this might be predictable, but I\u2019m okay with predictable. I would like to start to wrap up with a handful of questions. And the first one I\u2019m gonna ask is \u2013 and you actually give people a heads up on this with the Self-Inflicted Wounds. So, you usually say, \u201cAt some point, I am going to ask you about X.\u201d But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had time to think about this. So, do you have any favorite stories of self-inflicted wounds of your own that you could share? Aisha Tyler: Well, obviously the book is just a collection, not even a comprehensive one but quite detailed of many, many mistakes that I\u2019ve made. I\u2019m trying to think of something that\u2019s happened recently. It\u2019s interesting. I see my mistakes differently now than I did when I was younger. They just feel like an aspect of being human versus some kind of tragic \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Flaw. Aisha Tyler: Yeah, flaw. Exactly. They just seem like an unavoidable aspect of being alive. And I\u2019m trying to think if there\u2019s one \u2013 and then I\u2019m thinking of ones recently that don\u2019t feel that cataclysmic so they\u2019re lame stories. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you could pick a classic also, like the greatest hits. Like, if you\u2019re watching TV 15 years ago, and it\u2019s like, \u201cHits from the \u201880s. Da-da-da.\u201d We could take one of those as well. Aisha Tyler: Just off of that. Oh, God. Just thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. It\u2019s interesting. I was talking about that short film that I made that was the one that will never be seen by any human being \u2013 actually, I think it\u2019s been destroyed \u2013 where it was just like I just thought that I could just charm my way through this short. And I had a bunch of friends show up. And it was such an odd idea. It didn\u2019t even make any sense. It was about a guy who flashed women. He flashed women, and I can\u2019t remember why he flashed women. But it was something to do with bravery. It was a metaphor for bravery that this guy would flash women. And also maybe hubris, like the idea that people were gonna be super excited to see this guy\u2019s penis. And he would try to use it as currency, and it would never go his way. But it just made no sense. It just ended up being a series of vignettes about a guy revealing his penis to strangers. And I just remember at the end literally thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to think people don\u2019t get me.\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t get myself. I don\u2019t [inaudible]\u00a0trying to accomplish here.\u201d And it just never, ever coalesced. But it was fine because it was like \u2013 I remember enjoying the process of making it and then being really surprised and delighted by what a piece of shit it was much like that set where nobody laughed. I thought, \u201cWell, man. That didn\u2019t work at all. Okay. I need to go back and figure out what to do next.\u201d And I think every artist \u2013 I think Quentin Tarantino has a famous story about his first film being unwatchable. I just think sometimes, if your personality is to be really aggressive and dive in, you\u2019re bound to make some spectacular failures. And you just have to have a high tolerance for that and not take it personally and keep moving forward. But yeah. I literally was like, \u201cI know you guys don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get it. I can\u2019t explain it to you. I have no idea what I was thinking. Thank you for putting yourselves in my hands. It was a terrible mistake on your part. But you\u2019re very gracious to have trusted me with your lives.\u201d Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the name of the short? Aisha Tyler: It was called The Whipper. Tim Ferriss: Conjures all sorts of images. Aisha Tyler: It makes no sense whatsoever. Tim Ferriss: When have you been extremely proud of yourself? Could be any point in your life. Can you think of a standout point where you\u2019re like, \u201cGoddamn. Good for me. Fucking A\u201d? Aisha Tyler: I hate to have it be about this because it sounds like it\u2019s super self-promotional. But I really am proud of this film for a variety of reasons I think because it was \u2013 Tim Ferriss: AXIS? Aisha Tyler: Yeah, AXIS because it was such a \u2013 I was lucky that I was brought a great script. And I had a really talented actor. But we put this movie together so quickly. And I had a vision for it but I also was, because we were moving so fast, feeling my way through the dark in some aspect. And I think one of the reasons why it came together the way that it did was because I both had a vision for the film but I was open to modulating. And I think that\u2019s really important in anything that you\u2019re doing no matter what field you\u2019re in is that you have to both \u2013 we prize vision and rigidity in this culture. But I think that being able to pivot and be nimble is way more important than being a rigid visionary. You have to be able to look at data and interpret it and then apply it to your situation, or you\u2019re just gonna keep banging your head against a wall. So, we made this movie. We got into the very second day of filming. We started really late. We lost our light. We had to pivot that day. Ended up having to throw all that footage away. Another day, we lost light and had to get back up at 5:00 in the morning to shoot dawn for dusk. But we just kept pivoting. Nothing was catastrophic. And I think that\u2019s something I got from my father. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. This isn\u2019t working. Okay. So, we\u2019re gonna do this. Okay. That\u2019s not working. We\u2019re gonna do this,\u201d rather than, \u201cOh, my God. This is the end of the world. What are we gonna do?\u201d And then in post, I had very little money for post and very little time to cut the movie together. And about four weeks in, the editor that I had cutting the movie \u2013 he was a great guy. Really talented \u2013 just wasn\u2019t connecting with the material. Wasn\u2019t able to assemble the movie. It was an unusual movie. It\u2019s one guy in a car. And I had to let him go. And then I had to learn Avid, the Avid system and start cutting the movie myself. But again, I wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWhat am I gonna do? I don\u2019t have an editor. I\u2019m gonna die.\u201d I just said, \u201cOkay. Well, the answer here is that I\u2019m gonna learn this skillset, and I\u2019m going to keep moving forward.\u201d And then I made this little film. It was strange and atmospheric and dreamlike. It didn\u2019t get into Sundance. And everybody always wants to get into Sundance. But then it got into eight other festivals and won two awards and got picked up for distribution. And the result has been much better than I ever could have anticipated. And I\u2019m really proud of it because I made it for what is typically the catering budget on a regular Hollywood movie. We made it for just no money and in no time. And I think it also says something. I think what I\u2019m also proud of is that the movie actually does have a strong point of view and a strong visual personality and a strong style that is my own. When I look at it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to emulate anybody. I feel like this is something that I made. It\u2019s my little lumpy ashtray from shop class. And I really love it. Tim Ferriss: Good for you. I think it\u2019s easy to \u2013 I\u2019m not saying you but for humans to look at the people who are showcased on the covers of magazines or on the front pages of popular websites and think, \u201cWow. They figured out all the secret sauce,\u201d or, \u201cThey have the keys to the kingdom. And they\u2019re able to show up and just hit homeruns every time they step to the plate.\u201d And when you look at the origin stories of some of these incredible creations that people are familiar with, whether it\u2019s Jaws or \u2013 the company Alibaba is one example. Jack Ma, the founder, I think he\u2019s the richest man in China, or certainly one of the top few at this point. And he said \u2013 I\u2019m paraphrasing but, \u201cWe had a huge advantage in the beginning. And that was we had no experience, no money, and no plan.\u201d And it forces you to really think outside of the box. And even if that project doesn\u2019t succeed by outside measures, the confidence that you develop in exploring areas outside of the box can then transfer to future projects. I remember there was this fantastic documentary. I\u2019m gonna butcher his name. Well, it\u2019s fantastic mostly for the message, not for all of the content, which I hope makes sense. But it\u2019s called Jodorowsky\u2019s Dune. And it\u2019s the story of this attempt to make a movie about Dune. And the thing is a complete, unmitigated disaster. Complete, unmitigated disaster. But the talent that was assembled went on to just do incredible things. And if that disaster hadn\u2019t happened, one could argue that if you had stepped on that butterfly, these other careers wouldn\u2019t have blossomed in the way that they did, and you wouldn\u2019t have the Giger design of the alien that people now know as the alien of Aliens and so on. So, I just love \u2013 Aisha Tyler: And no one ever learns from success. You can do a postmortem and say, \u201cOh, this stuff worked.\u201d But failure is where you have explosive growth, where you really have to reconsider all of your assumptions. And it\u2019s so much more powerful than success is at making you eventually successful. Tim Ferriss: So, be aggressive. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Be, be aggressive. Tim Ferriss: B-E aggressive. A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E. Aisha Tyler: Oh, totally. Yeah. So, that\u2019s my life philosophy, be aggressive. Tim Ferriss: Be aggressive. And we want you around for a long time. So, take your cat naps at the very least. Aisha Tyler: That\u2019s my goal. Tim Ferriss: And do you have anything you would like to say or ask of the audience? Suggestions you\u2019d like to make? Anything at all that you\u2019d like to say before we wrap up? Aisha Tyler: Other than watch my movie? Tim Ferriss: Other than watch your movie. Exactly. Aisha Tyler: God, that\u2019s interesting. I guess when I did my podcast, it thematically \u2013 the stuff that we talked about was always stuff that I talked about which is it doesn\u2019t matter what you wanna do. And again, it sounds very greeting card. But the barriers, they\u2019re imagined. You know what I mean? And maybe you\u2019re gonna have to start small, and maybe you\u2019re gonna have to start close to home. But the greater regret will always be not having started. And I\u2019m always trying to find a way to be more bold in my life and hopefully share the things that have helped me do that with other people. So, it is exciting to be having the conversation with you because I think that\u2019s a lot of what you\u2019ve done is you\u2019ve lived these experiences so that the things that you learn could be shared with other people. And just go out and do awesome shit. Tim Ferriss: Get your hands dirty. Aisha Tyler: Get them dirty. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. The rough drafts are not a clean business. Aisha Tyler: Absolutely not. Tim Ferriss: Well, Aisha, thank you so much for taking the time. Aisha Tyler: It was a pleasure. Tim Ferriss: So much fun. Aisha Tyler: It was great to speak with you. I know. Super fun. And now that I know where you are, I will track you down the next time I\u2019m in your neck of the woods. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Barbecue, music, whatever it might be in Austin, Texas. Come visit. And people can visit you. Is the best site aishatyler.com? Aisha Tyler: Yeah. aishatyler.com. But who spends time on a website anymore? Just follow me on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. All that stuff is just AishaTyler, one word. Tim Ferriss: A-I-S-H-A-T-Y-L-E-R. Aisha Tyler: Absolutely. Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: And to everyone \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. You were gonna say something. Aisha Tyler: I don\u2019t know when this is gonna post, but I post stuff about all the stuff I\u2019m doing. The movie\u2019s out on the 10th of April on Video on Demand, iTunes, all that stuff. And then Archer starts I think on the 24th of April. And all the other st \u2013 I don\u2019t know. TV, whatever. You can find me online. I don\u2019t know when you\u2019re gonna listen to this. But just come say hi to me on social. I\u2019ll be \u2013 Tim Ferriss: For days and weeks and months and years and millennia to come, hopefully. We\u2019ll see. Aisha Tyler: Yeah. Cockroaches will be listening to this on their tiny cockroach computers when the rest of us are dead. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s exactly right. Cockroaches will remember us fondly. And for you non-cockroaches \u2013 actually, if cockroaches are listening, you\u2019re welcome also to check out the show notes where I will provide links to everything that we\u2019ve talked about, including AXIS. And you can find all of those at tim.blog/podcast along with the show notes for every other episode. And Aisha, thank you so much one more time for being so goddamn entertaining and inspiring at the same time. It\u2019s a rare combo. So, I really appreciate the time. Aisha Tyler: It\u2019s always great to talk with you. Thanks, Tim. Tim Ferriss: Of course. And to everybody out there on the interwebs, be safe maybe. More important, be aggressive. Get out there. If you\u2019re dreaming of doing something, creating something someday, just get out a shitty first draft because guess what? All the first drafts are really fucking awful. It\u2019s very rare that someone just, as I was alluding to, shits out diamonds on a daily basis. It starts with putting something out there into the world. And hopefully, at least it makes a market of one happy. And that is you. So, I will close there. And thanks to everybody for listening. Hey, guys. This is Tim again.

homework, read about your dad\u2019s favorite saying or question that he would ask", "and i was hoping you could explain this or share this with people who are listening because i think it\u2019s amazing", "yeah", "well, i was raised \u2013 my parents divorced when i was ten", "and my parents, i always joke that it\u2019s only rich people that can afford to fight about custody", "you know what i mean", "poor people just do whatever they have to do to manage", "and my parents, neither of them could really afford two kids", "and also, neither of them could afford to pay child support", "so, each of them just took one of us", "and i was older, so i went with my father", "and he was like, \u201cwhich one can wash itself?\u201d and that was the one that he took", "it was me", "and my father is the king of the very terse and pointed motivational speech", "so, i would leave for school in the morning", "i grew up in san francisco", "and at one point, we lived upstairs in a victorian", "so, i\u2019d go down these very steep stairs", "and he\u2019d lean over the railing, and he\u2019d go, \u201cwhose day is it?\u201d and i\u2019d have to say, \u201cit\u2019s my day.\u201d and then he\u2019d say, \u201cwhat are you gonna do?\u201d and i\u2019d have to say, \u201cgrab it by the balls.\u201d then he\u2019d say, \u201cand then what are you gonna do?\u201d and i\u2019d have to say, \u201cand twist and twist,\u201d as i was going out the door", "but it was funny because my dad was just \u2013 he was such a great dad", "he was a really engaged guy", "but he was a single father and relatively young", "so, maybe there were a few boundaries of propriety that he danced along", "but he just encouraged me to be aggressive", "i think it\u2019s very hard for single parents", "period", "and i think it\u2019s very hard for fathers and daughters because i just think if you\u2019re a dad, the world just looks like a field of broken glass and potholes and molten lava", "and then you\u2019ve got this little kitten", "and you\u2019re just so terrified to put the kitten down", "so, either they grip very tightly, or in my father\u2019s case, they throw you up in the air and expect that they\u2019ve given you the skills to land", "and that was definitely his strategy", "now you mentioned the divorce which i have read was amicable", "and it ended up resulting in you going with your father", "and you have one sibling", "i have a younger sister", "and she stayed with \u2013 younger sister", "stayed with your mom", "was that hard", "or did it not even occur to you to be hard because it just is what it was", "or was that difficult", "and did you have constant contact", "or what was the dynamic like", "it\u2019s interesting because i think it was more the second for me", "it just was what was happening", "and i don\u2019t ever remember struggling in any grand way with the way that things were going", "and look, maybe that\u2019s my nature", "i know my parents worked very hard to be loving and available to both of us", "and i had lots of access to my mother", "and i talked to her all the time", "and i called her for advice", "and she got to be the fun mom or the advice mom", "she didn\u2019t have to discipline me", "she could just be the person who was there when i needed emotional support", "i do know that one of the things it resulted in, at least when we were younger, was my sister and i \u2013 we weren\u2019t super close, but lots of siblings aren\u2019t super close when they\u2019re kids, whether they\u2019re living in the same house or not", "they\u2019re fighting, and they\u2019re competitive", "but as we got older, i became wildly protective of my sister", "and my relationship with her is so intensely loving and affectionate now", "and i don\u2019t know", "maybe if we lived in the same house driving each other nuts all the time, we wouldn\u2019t be as close as we are now", "we spent the formative years of our lives living in different houses", "but we like the same stuff, and we care about the same things", "and our connection\u2019s really deep", "so, i don\u2019t ever remember sitting up at night feeling any kind of agony about the fact that my parents were divorcing", "i did watch them try very hard to stay together", "i do remember that when they got a divorce, i was like, \u201cthey really gave it a shot.\u201d i could see that they really \u2013 they would break up, and they\u2019d get back together", "and they\u2019d break up, and they\u2019d get back together", "and i remember i\u2019d walk in on them, and they\u2019d be making out on the couch", "i was like, \u201cthey are really giving this a go.\u201d so, when they decided it was over, i was like, \u201cokay", "yeah.\u201d i don\u2019t ever remember it being a point of agony", "things changed", "and maybe as a result, i tolerate change better than i would otherwise", "or maybe i even crave change", "i don\u2019t know", "has it been your demeanor to generally look at things through a positive lens like that where you would frame what other people might try to frame as a very difficult, agonizing experience into something that was or at least is framed as something positive that you benefited from", "or have you had more of the time a tendency to frame things negatively", "that\u2019s a really good question", "and i think about that a lot because i think that my attitude or my point of view about things is half biochemistry and half child-rearing", "my father is just a preternaturally optimistic person", "it\u2019s extraordinary", "i always make this joke that if my father\u2019s house was on fire, he would get a stick and marshmallows", "he just cannot be deterred", "or i\u2019ve never seen it", "he\u2019s just never down", "and so, i think that i inherited that", "and maybe it\u2019s attitudinal", "i think i just probably make up the chemicals in my brain that keep me typically upbeat", "you know what i mean", "and i think it\u2019s important because i think a lot of times when people are \u2013 if they have a hard time seeing the world positively or if they\u2019re struggling with depression, people are like, \u201cwell, you just need to look at it a different way.\u201d but i think that i probably just make more of the chemicals that enable me to be optimistic", "i\u2019ve never really been depressed", "but my father also was just a walk it off dad", "he just did not feel sorry for me", "and i was not allowed to feel sorry for myself", "and so, when things went wrong \u2013 and this has definitely sustained till i was an adult \u2013 i just get up and i keep going", "and that was because my father was raised \u2013 he lost his father when he was very, very young", "he was raised by a single mother and tumbled down pittsburgh with the very few opportunities for a black man at that time", "and he just never felt sorry for himself", "he was just like, \u201clook, i can complain about the situation, or i can just keep moving.\u201d so, i think i\u2019ve been nurtured in that way as well which is the world is unfair", "it\u2019s shot through with assholes", "i still have to get up in the morning and make a life for myself", "and so, it\u2019s probably a combination of those two things", "were you, would you say, good at following his advice of not only grabbing life by the balls but twisting, which is a whole new level", "those are two really \u2013 you can gently grab balls", "you can\u2019t really gently grab and twist balls", "of course", "the twisting is a \u2013 yes", "that\u2019s an elevated form of aggression", "yeah", "i don\u2019t know", "it\u2019s hard to say, \u201coh, i\u2019m nailing it.\u201d that\u2019s not how i feel", "but i do think that that attitude of just go \u2013 and i wrote a lot about it in my book, the idea that my parents raised me to be brave and in some ways, maybe too brave", "but the result has been a relentlessness and in the pursuit of the things that are important to me", "and that\u2019s not the same as, \u201ci\u2019m winning.\u201d i don\u2019t really think about things that way", "but if i wanna do something, then i do it", "and i don\u2019t really worry too much about whether it\u2019s gonna go my way, not because i expect it to go my way but because it doesn\u2019t matter if it goes my way because it\u2019s the engagement that\u2019s most meaningful to me", "it\u2019s the effort", "i got it", "so, by engagement, you mean the dogged persistence that you\u2019re developing", "the engagement in your personal goals", "if i wanna do something, whatever \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "let\u2019s pick something really innocuous", "if i wanna hike every day for a month, or if i wanna start meditating, if i don\u2019t dial it, it\u2019s not as important to me as not looking back and saying, \u201ci should have done it.\u201d it\u2019s the doing for me that is the reward", "and then sometimes things go my way, and sometimes they don\u2019t", "but the thing i find most upsetting is regret because that\u2019s something i have control over in the sense of if you didn\u2019t do it, you have nobody to blame but yourself", "right", "you can always attempt", "you can\u2019t predetermine \u2013 you can\u2019t \u2013 [crosstalk] \u2013 success", "yeah", "you can\u2019t predetermine the outcome", "but you can predetermine the effort because the effort is the only thing that you own", "you can\u2019t own results", "you can only own initiative", "and you mentioned your dad being a walk it off dad", "i wanna explore that a little bit", "do you remember any \u2013 while you were still under his watch or not \u2013 early disappointments or self-inflicted wounds and how your dad responded", "or mistakes", "yeah", "well, this isn\u2019t exactly a good example of a disappointment", "but it\u2019s a perfect example of his attitude", "i was going to camp", "i must have been about eight or nine", "i\u2019ll say nine", "and i was going to jiu-jitsu camp", "and this was still during the free-range parenting era where you just got up in the morning, and you left at home, and you came back later", "and that stuff was your responsibility", "so \u2013 wait", "did you say eight or nine and then jiu-jitsu camp", "yeah", "i was really into martial arts when i was a kid", "so \u2013 [crosstalk] oh, okay", "it was making me think of the movie, hanna where \u2013 [crosstalk] eric bana trains his daughter to be a super killer", "i\u2019m just \u2013 i wish i was that good at jiu-jitsu", "but unfortunately, that was not one of my stronger \u2013 but as i\u2019ve pointed out, it wasn\u2019t the result that was important", "it was just the effort", "so, i would ride my bike to camp every day and ride it home", "and it was a good ride", "it was a five-mile ride to camp", "and i fell one day coming down a hill", "this was no helmets", "this was a long time ago", "i\u2019m very old", "no helmets", "just willy-nilly your backpack on, and you\u2019re not signaling", "and i fell", "and i hurt my arm very badly", "and i think i went \u2013 i can\u2019t remember, but i contacted my dad", "and he\u2019s like, \u201ci\u2019m not gonna come get you", "i can\u2019t leave work", "you have to get home on your own.\u201d so, i rode my bike back from camp another three, four more miles", "and my arm was broken", "it was definitely broken", "i had broken my arm", "and i got home", "and my dad was like, \u201cyour arm\u2019s not broken", "you need to stop complaining", "it\u2019s just sore.\u201d and the next day, i woke up", "it was black and swollen", "and i had to lift it off the pillow", "and he finally took me to the doctor, and it was absolutely a compound fracture", "the bone hadn\u2019t come through the skin, but it was a multiple fracture", "i think at the time, it felt cruel", "but i think my dad\u2019s larger attitude was, \u201cno one is coming to save you", "you have to save yourself", "you have to find a way every single day to save yourself.\u201d and as a result, i think that as an adult, i just don\u2019t spend a lot of time anguishing over what\u2019s been done to me", "and i was fine", "i did ride my bike home", "and my arm was broken, but i still got home on my bike", "and then the next day, i got a super dope cast", "and i think we just raise these \u2013 i know i sound like everybody\u2019s mom, but i just feel like we\u2019re curating young people\u2019s experiences so aggressively nowadays that they just don\u2019t have any way to discover things about themselves", "they don\u2019t develop not just self-sufficiency but a curiosity about themselves and their abilities and what they can tolerate and what they can do if left alone because they\u2019re just never left alone", "i had a lot of time alone when i was a kid, and i still really like being alone as an adult", "right", "and also, it strikes me that if you\u2019re so protective of your child and your child\u2019s ego that you effectively disallow them to fail or engage with risk that the delta, the difference between their actual competencies and abilities for self-preservation and their overinflated sense of their capabilities is actually a huge disservice", "oh, absolutely", "and their sense of \u2013 you need to know what it feels like to fail and then what comes next because what comes next is, \u201cwhat did i learn", "how can i adjust", "how do i pivot", "how do i move forward?\u201d and just most people don\u2019t develop those mental skills", "they\u2019re crushed by failure", "and it\u2019s just an unavoidable element of life", "and there\u2019s so many people that i know whose \u2013 out of real, genuine love, parents like, \u201ci just don\u2019t wanna see my kid in pain.\u201d but how are you gonna \u2013 how do people move through the planet", "how do these people move through life without pain", "that\u2019s a false theory", "it can\u2019t be done", "it just cannot be done", "and so, people just become incapacitated the first minute they hit any kind of a speedbump in their lives", "and they just don\u2019t know how to navigate disappointment, whereas i was just deeply disappointed throughout my childhood, so i know exactly what it feels like", "i\u2019m just like, \u201cnext.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cthat didn\u2019t go my way", "moving on.\u201d well, yeah", "and it makes me conjure in my mind the image of this increasing amplitude of pain consequence over your life from childhood to adulthood where the consequences grow potentially greater and greater, where in the beginning, when you\u2019re a child, you\u2019re basically engaging with pain and \u2013 i shouldn\u2019t say pain but failure in many cases", "not all cases but many cases where you\u2019re effectively in one of those birthday party blowup sumo suits", "do you know what i\u2019m talking about", "yes", "yes", "and it\u2019s like, \u201call right.\u201d so, you can engage with failure that way", "and if you get knocked on your ass, there aren\u2019t really real consequences", "then you get to high school, college, and it\u2019s like, \u201cokay", "you\u2019re out of the sumo suit, but you\u2019ve got big, blowup boxing gloves on and a huge piece of headgear.\u201d then when you get out into some aspects of the real world, it\u2019s just a bareknuckle brawl", "and so, if you haven\u2019t had the chance \u2013 with permanent consequences and real \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah, exactly", "so, if you haven\u2019t had the chance to get wailed in the face with a sumo suit, you\u2019re not gonna be ready for the blowup boxing gloves and the headgear", "and certainly, if you don\u2019t get whacked in the face a few times doing that, you\u2019re just gonna be crippled when you get out into the real world and get dropkicked in the face by someone who doesn\u2019t follow the same rules", "yeah", "and crippled in that way that \u2013 and i know you\u2019ve interacted with people like this", "in that way where when something bad happens, their whole monologue is like, \u201cwhy me?\u201d like, \u201cwhy did this happen to me", "you don\u2019t understand what i\u2019m going through.\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cyou\u2019re not special", "everybody is experiencing the same thing", "everybody\u2019s heart is being broken", "everybody isn\u2019t getting the job they want", "everybody isn\u2019t gonna sleep with the hot person they want", "everybody is experiencing the same failures, these same injuries", "but you just don\u2019t know how to tolerate them", "you are not special.\u201d and that\u2019s not the same as saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t have the potential for being special.\u201d but there\u2019s nothing anybody\u2019s doing now that hasn\u2019t already been done or that won\u2019t be done in the future", "and those kinds of personalities drive me crazy because they\u2019re so stuck and boring", "what did you think you were going to be when you grew up when you were in high school or college", "oh, god", "in high school, it\u2019s so interesting because i was super academic", "and i think i thought i\u2019d be an attorney", "i was a big activist, and i organized and marched and did all that stuff", "and i was in the outing club", "and i rock climbed and all that stuff", "so, i thought i was gonna be an environmental lawyer", "either an environmental lawyer or an environmental engineer", "and then i got to \u2013 and i really wanted to go to a school that was really grounded in a relationship to nature", "so, i was applying to marlborough college and reed and bard, and these schools that were out in the woods", "and i ended up going to dartmouth which is in new hampshire and has this big land grant around it", "and i thought i would be an environmental engineer", "and i think i just took the first prerequisite math course for engineering", "i was like, \u201cyeah", "okay", "it\u2019s just not gonna be \u2013 just not right.\u201d and i always loved science, but i\u2019m just a person of letters, i guess", "and i didn\u2019t have the appetite for it", "it wasn\u2019t as glamorous as i thought", "i think when i took my first engineering \u2013 i think i\u2019d got through the math class", "i did fine", "i applied myself, and i got a good grade", "and then i went into my introduction to engineering three, and it was about building a fecal matter treatment plant", "and i was like, \u201cthis isn\u2019t feeling like hugging trees at all, man", "we\u2019re just talking about poop all day.\u201d i lost my appetite for that really quickly", "so, then what", "did you just have this great existential angst", "or did you shift to something else immediately following that", "i was always doing performing things on the side", "i went to a high school that had a performing arts magnet or a pocket school within the regular school called the j", "eugene mcateer school of the arts", "so, i was doing my regular classwork and then doing improv and stuff and sketch on the side", "and then i went to dartmouth, and i was just doing some of the same stuff", "i was in one of those infernal ivy leagues acapella groups that have been popularized since then by shows like glee", "so, i was always doing that as a hobby because it just never felt like a real job", "and i graduated", "and i was living in san francisco, and i was working for a conservation organization that was a killer", "i got my dream job", "it was a group that purchased blighted urban land and turned it into parks in underserved neighborhoods that didn\u2019t have any outdoor space for kids to play", "the mission was great because it wasn\u2019t just conservation for conservation\u2019s sake", "it was conservation focused on engaging underserved communities", "and it was the grooviest", "and i was just miserable", "and i just \u2013 why were you miserable", "i didn\u2019t know", "it was a really good question", "it was like, \u201cwhy, if i have my dream job in the city of my birth, why am i so unhappy?\u201d and i just did a lot of soul-searching", "and i realized it was because for the first time in my life, i wasn\u2019t doing anything creative", "i wasn\u2019t performing", "and so, i\u2019m a problem-solver", "i\u2019m a matrix builder", "i was like, \u201cwell, how can i solve this problem right now?\u201d and i looked at all the ways that i could get on stage", "and standup comedy was the only thing i didn\u2019t need to know anyone for or have an agent or a band or connections", "i could just do standup right away", "and so, i started studying it and watching the precursor to comedy central which was this network called ha!, a very short-lived network, and taking notes", "and then after a while, just screwed up the courage to go and do an open mic", "and then it was just transformational", "i was like, \u201coh, this is what i want to do with my life.\u201d was the thinking immediately on how to turn performance into a career", "or did you expect that you would continue doing your job and doing standup on the side", "was it a career move from when you first built the matrix and decided on standup", "or was it, \u201cyou know what", "this is gonna be great", "i\u2019ll continue doing this job, and i\u2019ll scratch my creative performance itch on the weekends with open mics\u201d", "yeah", "it\u2019s so funny because i don\u2019t think i even realized that standup comedy was a job", "i was a really bookish kid", "a lot of guys will have these stories about how they grew up with redd foxx on vinyl that they listened to hundreds of times or following lenny bruce or these idols or bill hicks", "i remember seeing live on the sunset strip when i was a kid", "but i just thought richard pryor was an alien", "you know what i mean", "like, a magical person who came down to do this thing", "the idea that that was a vocation was just not in my head", "so, i remember seeing standup at dartmouth when i was a sophomore and coming out of a show and being like, \u201cdo people know that you can go and have this feeling for an hour", "this is insanity.\u201d i just remembered everything hurt from laughing", "my face and my stomach", "and i just never experienced live comedy before", "so, it didn\u2019t dovetail into a job at first", "it was just something i was gonna do for fun", "i kept my day job 100 percent", "and i kept it for a long time", "i also didn\u2019t wanna be one of these miserable, sweating standups who were gripping their inky notebook and sleeping on their buddy\u2019s couch", "i was in a relationship", "and i had a job", "and it paid great", "and i could make flyers for my shows at work", "i was embezzling copy paper and pushpins as aggressively as i could", "so, i was and i still am of the opinion that you should absolutely keep your day job which i know is not in the most popular \u2013 [crosstalk] i\u2019m of the same opinion", "absolutely", "yeah", "yeah", "i think it gives you a freedom", "people think it traps them", "but i think it gives you this incredible freedom to just pursue art for art\u2019s sake and let a job pay for it and do it for so long that everything you do is just for joy", "and it changes the way that you approach your art", "i would get up, and i\u2019d go to work at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning", "and i work until 4:00", "and then i\u2019d jump in the car, and i\u2019d drive two hours to sacramento to do a set", "and i\u2019d come back at midnight", "i\u2019d do it all over again", "but i could do that", "and then it was just purely about the experience of performing and not about whether i was getting paid or not", "so, i did that for a long time before i finally quit my job", "now, for those people who don\u2019t know the geography of northern california where i lived for 17 years and \u2013 coincidentally, the high school that you went to, is that now the ruth asawa school on o\u2019shaugnessy", "yes", "it\u2019s on o\u2019shaugnessy", "yeah", "up there at the nexus of \u2013 [crosstalk] twin peaks/glen park canyon", "exactly", "so, i literally lived for five or six years about a quarter mile from that school", "it was right there", "it\u2019s not a big city even though i think when you live there, it feels like it", "but it\u2019s an intimate place", "it\u2019s an intimate place", "and given the density of san francisco and the fact that it i \u2013 well, i\u2019m not gonna go so f \u2013 i don\u2019t know if people would consider it a comedy town, but there are certainly clubs and so on", "oh, it\u2019s a comedy town", "it\u2019s a comedy town", "[crosstalk] yeah", "so, why would you go all the way to sacramento", "for those people who don\u2019t know the area, it\u2019s not a ten-minute drive away from san francis \u2013 no, it\u2019s far", "it\u2019s far", "san francisco\u2019s always had a reputation for being a comedy town", "the big comedy towns in the united states from the comedian\u2019s perspectives are san francisco, chicago, boston, and new york", "la is a company town, but it\u2019s not a comedy town", "and san francisco was always one of those places that people saw as a real crucible for original comedy", "it was where the alt comedy movement happened and where marc maron and janeane garofalo and these alternative comics, brian posehn came out of", "and it was a comedy town", "but when i started doing comedy, it was the beginning of the contraction of the comedy economy", "so, there was a period of time when there were just hundreds of comedy clubs everywhere", "and you could make a living doing standup", "you could go from place to place, and you could get a gig, and you could get paid", "and i started doing standup at the beginning of the end of the comedy bubble", "so, when i started doing standup, the club community was contracting", "and some of the big clubs in san francisco were closing", "i think at one point there were maybe five or six active clubs", "and then by the time i was working consistently, there were only two", "and there was just a lot of competition for stage time", "and to get good at comedy, you can\u2019t just do it once a weekend", "you need to be on stage every night", "it\u2019s like being a high diver", "or you know what", "it\u2019s literally like malcolm gladwell\u2019s 10,000 hours", "and you\u2019re not gonna get 10,000 hours of standup hanging out in san francisco", "you have to go everywhere and take every single opportunity to be on stage that you can get", "so, i would drive to sacramento", "i would drive to fresno", "i would do these terrible bar shows in menlo park and \u2013 oh, god", "i don\u2019t even remember some of the places", "cupertino and martinez", "you would just go anywhere that you could get six minutes on stage", "and there were 100 other people trying to get those same six minutes", "so, it was really competitive", "the culture i think was pretty supportive", "comedians were supportive of each other", "but there just wasn\u2019t enough stage time, so you would just do anything and go anywhere to get it", "i wanna ask about this comedy contraction", "we won\u2019t spend too much time on this because i don\u2019t wanna take us completely off the reservation, but what happened", "it was like beanie babies", "people were really into beanie babies, then it\u2019s like, \u201cno", "comedy isn\u2019t cool anymore.\u201d and then all the clubs closed", "was it just a macroeconomic downturn", "what happened", "i think there were three factors", "one factor was just there was just a glut", "live comedy, in some ways in the \u201870s and \u201880s, was a new thing", "and it\u2019s not like people hadn\u2019t been doing standup prior to that", "but the proliferation of standup comedians in the culture really started happening at that time", "and what that was fueled by, i honestly don\u2019t know", "why were there so many more comics doing standup in the \u201870s and \u201880s", "maybe because that was the period where there were these superstar comics that were \u2013 and i\u2019m trying to think of who would have been really popular besides bill hicks and \u2013 [crosstalk] i can see that though", "maybe it\u2019s analogous to celebrity chefs in the last 15 years", "yeah, exactly", "but part of the reason why there are so many more celebrity chefs is because there started to be celebrity chefs on television", "and so, if you think about that in terms of comedy, what you see is, \u201coh, that\u2019s a job", "i could make money at that,\u201d whereas people weren\u2019t really encountering live comedy if they didn\u2019t go to a live comedy show", "and so, you start to see these guys on tv, and you think \u2013 and honestly, when ha!, the precursor to comedy central started, they needed comics, and they needed opportunities", "they needed clubs", "they needed content", "it was a 24-hour network", "so, there were some good comedians on that station, and there were some really shitty ones", "really bad", "and so, a lot of people watching probably thought, \u201cwell, i can do that.\u201d i also think about guys like sam kinison and andrew dice clay", "there was a golden era in that time", "and we were seeing all those people on tv", "then we were seeing a lot of people that were really subpar", "and a lot of people were thinking, \u201cwell, if that guy can write five crappy minutes about an airplane, i can.\u201d then you couple that with this explosion in comedy clubs which were a relatively new phenomenon", "when joan rivers was doing standup, she was doing standup in strip clubs", "there were very few comedy clubs", "and comedy was part of a vaudeville approach", "so, you\u2019d hire a singer", "and then you\u2019d hire a comic", "but there weren\u2019t places dedicated to comedy", "so, these comedy clubs opened", "it was a really easy way to make money because comics weren\u2019t that expensive", "and you had a two-drink minimum", "people would come in", "they would get wasted", "you\u2019d have huge margins on your booze", "so, these comedy clubs started proliferating", "and then there was just peak clubs", "it would \u2013 it\u2019s saturation", "yeah", "it became unsustainable", "so, they started to contract because of market saturation", "the economy started to contract in the \u201880s", "and people could watch comedy on tv", "the proliferation of comedy on television affected people going out to see it in a club", "so, there were those three factors all intersecting", "and when it happened, it was really aggressive", "like i said, i think there were maybe five or six comedy clubs in san francisco when i was in high school", "and then by the time i was doing standup in my 20s, there were two", "and so, you would do \u2013 and they were attracting high-end, peak talent", "so, for example, this club is still there", "it\u2019s called the punchline", "punchline", "i\u2019ve been there a few times", "there was the punchline, and there was cobb\u2019s", "and those are still the only two clubs", "and maybe there\u2019s some minor clubs that have sprung up since then", "but they would book these big headliners", "so, the only time you could go up if you were an amateur, a young comic was on a sunday or a wednesday", "and there\u2019d be 20 other guys trying to get on as well", "and it would be wildly competitive", "and you wouldn\u2019t be getting paid", "and then you\u2019d be super anxious because you\u2019d be hoping, \u201cokay", "i need to go up, and i need to destroy because i want this club owner to hire me again", "so, i can\u2019t work out", "i can\u2019t fail in front of this guy because he won\u2019t see this \u2013\u201d you know when you watch an olympic skater during practice, and they\u2019re falling", "that\u2019s what practice is for", "practice is for finding your weak spots and reinforcing them", "but when you\u2019re up in front of a comedy club owner, and it\u2019s been six months that you\u2019ve been trying to get out in this club, and you finally get five minutes, it\u2019s gotta be a monster five minutes", "and so, there was just no way to improve", "you can\u2019t improve \u2013 yeah", "i was gonna say, how do you get in your rough drafts then", "how do you work on the material", "drive to martinez and \u2013 oh, i see", "i see", "so, you\u2019d work out the kinks with the crew at the such and such casino in god knows where, turlock", "and then \u2013 [crosstalk] \u2013 fubars or rooster t", "feathers or one of these other places that \u2013 yeah", "and there was this \u2013 it\u2019s different than being an author or an athlete or even a musician because there\u2019s an autonomy to comedy, absolutely", "but you need other people", "you can\u2019t do it \u2013 you can\u2019t just sit around your place practicing", "you know what i mean", "with music, you know if you\u2019re sharp or flat", "you know if you hit all the notes", "you know if the tempo\u2019s right", "but with comedy, the only way it works is in front of an audience", "and so, you\u2019re very dependent on stage time", "and it\u2019s everything when you\u2019re a young comic is stage time", "well, do you remember your early content", "what was your approach early on", "do you remember the first \u2013 and maybe a different way to approach this \u2013 you could answer it however you like", "do you remember the first time that you bombed", "or what is your first memory that comes to mind of bombing", "oh, god", "i bombed so many times", "it just all seeps together into an inky blackness", "any comic who tells you they never bombed is lying", "and again, the only way to get funny is to bomb", "no one ever gets funnier after they kill", "they just walk out like, \u201cfollow that, bitches.\u201d and they drop the mic", "you know what i mean", "and then they go off and do shots with their friends", "you really need to bomb and bomb hard to get funny", "i remember doing this one show \u2013 oh, god", "so, there was an open mic in a laundromat in south market, around the police station there", "so, maybe 8th and mission or something like that for people who know san francisco", "and i think it was called brainwash", "i think the place was called brainwash", "and they would have this open mic in the back of this laundromat", "and comics know with these local open mics that typically, there are no actual audience members in the audience", "it is just a room full of comedians waiting for you to be done so that they can try out their material, all of them looking at their notebooks, not listening, not laughing", "and you\u2019re just trying to gut it out and pause where you think the laughter might occur if you were in front of actual human beings", "and i just did a set where i did not get one laugh, not even a cursory titter", "and i remember just silence", "just a wall of silence", "and i got off", "even thinking about it right now, it\u2019s so funny to me", "i talked to a girlfriend afterwards and was like, \u201coh, my god", "i couldn\u2019t even call that a bad set", "i don\u2019t know what that was.\u201d but it was so funny to me that i didn\u2019t get a laugh", "there was this bulletproofness that i got from that set that just made me impervious to anything ever going wrong in my life or career again", "and even when i\u2019m talking about it now, there\u2019s a huge smile on my face because it was so funny how little i was able to elicit out of that audience", "but it just made me so mentally strong", "was that the immediate response that you had", "or were you in the middle of the set when you\u2019re in the back of your mind thinking, \u201cwow, no one is laughing,\u201d was there \u2013 did you go from pan \u2013 was it the reverse of the five stages of grief where like, \u201cwhat\u201d", "or did you just go straight to, \u201cyeah, motherfuckers", "this is great.\u201d just the acceptance", "just full acceptance", "\u201cthis is gonna make a great story however many years from now on tim ferriss\u2019 podcast.\u201d well, one thing comedians love is agony", "we dine out on it", "it\u2019s definitely our stock and trade", "so, a comedian very quickly transitions from, \u201coh, my god", "this is the worst night of my life,\u201d to, \u201coh, my god", "this is gonna make a great story.\u201d that happens almost instantaneously", "so, we have some armor in that regard because we could wake up naked and shivering on the side of the road with no money and no phone and not speak the local language, and you\u2019d be thinking, \u201cokay", "if i live, this is gonna make a killer story.\u201d so, i think in the moment, i just thought \u2013 i had watched a couple other people go up and not do very well either", "i was prepared for it not going my way", "and i just thought, \u201ci\u2019m just \u2013\u201d and i think also, there\u2019s a discipline to comedy that if you\u2019re not a comedian you can\u2019t understand which is that you\u2019ve got to get up and do your set", "you don\u2019t get to tap out", "tapping out is true failure", "if you went up and you had a bad set, well, you just need to write new jokes", "but if you go up and you give up, that\u2019s true failure for a comedian", "and there are some really famous examples of this online", "i don\u2019t know if you know the comedian bill burr, but \u2013 so, i interviewed bill burr about a year and a half ago, and i played the video which he had never seen, or he claimed to have never seen", "yes, because he had some real \u2013 he still has some psychic \u2013 he has some trauma", "he has some \u2013 so, for people who don\u2019t know the story, can you please describe it", "because it\u2019s amazing", "it\u2019s insane, right", "it\u2019s insane", "so, he was doing one of those radio station concerts like the jingle ball or whatever", "and i don\u2019t remember", "it was called the weenie roast", "i think it was the weenie roast", "so, it\u2019s one of the shows at some local sta \u2013 like, \u201ck-rock", "97.rock", "k-rock.\u201d like one of those shows", "and it\u2019s like \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "weezer\u2019s too cool of a band", "it would be nickelback and some other band that sounds like nickelback and then an opening band you\u2019ve never heard of", "i don\u2019t know why people still do this, but if you\u2019re a comic and somebody offers you money, you take it", "so, they would hire a comic to warm up the crowd early in the day", "and no one pays to see nickelback and then wants to sit through 15 minutes of standup", "everyone\u2019s drunk and on drugs", "and they\u2019re not even facing forward", "the only thing worse than performing in front of an outdoor audience is performing in front of people who are eating because \u2013 yeah", "this was like a tailgate at 11:00 a.m", "or 1:00 p.m", "or something", "yeah", "everybody busted out their marijuana brownie recipe for the year", "they\u2019re all completely looped", "one of their eyes is completely dilated, and the other one is falling out of their head", "nobody cares about your jokes about your mom and your family", "so, they could not muster compassion if they tried", "so, he starts doing standup, and he just immediately starts getting booed", "and it\u2019s just this tidal wave of disdain", "and he knows if he doesn\u2019t finish, he will not get paid", "but it\u2019s not like \u2013 silence, you can tolerate", "but people are screaming at him to get off stage", "and he makes it very clear to the audience \u2013 you have to watch it because i\u2019ll never be able to do it justice", "but he makes it very clear to the audience that he is not leaving the stage until he does his ten minutes, that he does not care how they feel about him", "and he\u2019s counting down the minutes as they \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah", "every minute he\u2019s like, \u201cnine minute, you fucking fucks.\u201d exactly", "he says something really outrageous like, \u201ci hope your mother gets cancer in the center of her asshole", "seven minutes.\u201d and it\u2019s just so \u2013 it\u2019s just a demonstration of tenacity", "later, he was embarrassed by it", "but every comedian understands this blood battle that you sometimes have with an audience where they\u2019re not gonna scare you, and they\u2019re not gonna drive you away", "you\u2019re going to deliver the material that you were hired to deliver", "you\u2019re going to make your money", "and then you\u2019re gonna go off and spend it on light beer and chicken wings", "but you will not be deterred", "so, i think because you understand that as a comedian very early on in your career, no matter what happens on stage, i will not be moved", "so, i had material to do", "and i did it", "and i remember thinking almost immediately, \u201cwell, okay", "i\u2019m not gonna get any laughs", "so, i\u2019m just gonna listen to this set and see what it feels like, see what the words feel like, see what might play in front of actual people.\u201d but it started to get really delicious", "and i think if you watch the bill burr video, you\u2019ll also see that he starts to really enjoy it", "it starts to be this savory masochism towards the end where he\u2019s so powerful in his lack of caring", "you know what i mean", "and you watch it, and it is to be studied because he goes from anguish to rage to this delightful detachment by the end of the set", "and i\u2019ve seen some other guys do similar stuff", "and it\u2019s always really fun to watch", "so, a couple of things that i want to use as teasers for people who should watch this video", "i think it was in phila \u2013 i\u2019m almost 100 percent positive it was in philadelphia", "philadelphia", "i think that\u2019s ri \u2013 either that or jersey", "but yeah", "it was \u2013 yeah", "i think it was philadelphia because he started ridiculing rocky", "and he said, \u201cyour hero is a fictional person,\u201d and just tearing into them", "and he basically, for half of his set, just decided to abandon his material and just attack these people in the town", "and \u2013 which, by the way, is a no-no, generally", "yeah, which is a no-no, generally", "yeah", "typically, if people hate you \u2013 there are these unwritten rules of comedy", "and one of them is you don\u2019t \u2013 if some of the people in the audience hate you, don\u2019t turn all of them against you", "this is just a sidebar, but don\u2019t forget what you were gonna say", "there\u2019s another very famous video, very famous", "and it happened at the punchline in san francisco where there\u2019s a guy playing \u2013 he\u2019s a guitar comic", "and a guy\u2019s heckling him", "and it\u2019s just combative back and forth but nothing too extreme", "but then the guy gets up, and he comes towards the stage, whatever, to defend himself or the girl he\u2019s with", "something like that", "and the guy just hauls off and hits him in the head with the guitar", "sorry", "sorry", "not funny", "it\u2019s tragic", "but jesus christ", "it\u2019s spectacular", "everybody lived", "but what happens is up until that beat, the whole audience has been on the comedian\u2019s side against this guy", "and it is a hairpin turn from them being like, \u201cyeah, shut up,\u201d because the comic\u2019s like, \u201chey, people can\u2019t enjoy the show because you\u2019re talking", "keep it down.\u201d and then he hits this guy, and the whole audience just turns on him, like instantaneous like frankenstein\u2019s monster mob", "just the pitchforks come flying out", "and so, one of the unwritten rules of comedy is that you wanna try to at all costs avoid turning everybody against you", "so, bill broke a bunch of rules, but he never gave up, which i think it becomes \u2013 it\u2019s like the rudy moment at the end of the movie like, \u201cman, that sucked", "but you sure stuck in there.\u201d and he got a standing ov \u2013 well, everybody was already standing, but he got massive applause from the audience at the end which is just \u2013 because they\u2019re just like, \u201cwhat the fuck?\u201d it didn\u2019t even fit into any mental heuristic of comedy that they could expect", "that was straight prison yard dynamics", "nobody can know you \u2013 there\u2019s a line from out of sight just like the yard", "\u201cnobody backing down", "nobody\u2019s backing down.\u201d i think there was probably 10,000 of them to one of him", "and he just did not back down", "so, he got the slow respect clap at the end of the show", "oh, my god", "so, i wasn\u2019t gonna go to heckling, but why not since we\u2019re already here", "do you have any memorable heckling stories", "or do you recall the first time you got heckled", "god, yeah", "i started doing standup 25 years ago, so at this point, all the sets have just blended", "and heckling can be lots of different things", "it doesn\u2019t always have to be the conventional, \u201cyou suck,\u201d heckle", "i had one time where this woman \u2013 and this dovetails perfectly with the old, \u201cdon\u2019t turn the audience against you,\u201d \u2013 where this woman was talking to me", "she was sitting in the front row, and she was talking to me the entire show just loud enough that i could hear her but not really loud enough so the audience could hear her except for the people right around her", "and it was driving me crazy", "it was like a bee in my ear", "and as a result, i just seemed insane because i kept stopping to yell at this person that no one could hear", "and it would look like i\u2019m having a breakdown", "it was a very effective heckle because she just completely derailed my show", "and i just seemed like a dick because i was like, \u201cshut up, lady,\u201d but no one could hear what she was saying", "so, like, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you", "this nice lady in the front trying to enjoy the night?\u201d i remember that i really went off the rails last night", "and i generally have a rule with hecklers that unless they\u2019re really disruptive to the entire room, i just never address them because what you do is you derail a show for 500 or 1,000 people to deal with one person", "and everyone\u2019s never gonna really understand what\u2019s going on unless that person\u2019s so loud that they\u2019ve effected everybody else\u2019s enjoyment of the night", "but sometimes the affectionate hecklers are the worse because they don\u2019t \u2013 typically, hecklers just wanna be a part of the show", "and so, they say something, you slam them a little bit, they shut up because they think they\u2019re helping you out", "the famous line is they\u2019ll come up and be like, \u201chey, you like how i helped you out?\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cbuddy, i came with jokes", "i don\u2019t need assistance.\u201d like, \u201ci don\u2019t have a box jumper in my act, all right", "i showed up ready to go.\u201d but when people are affectionate, you can\u2019t insult them", "and they\u2019re the most unmanageable kind of hecklers", "now by affectionate, you mean someone who\u2019s like, \u201ci love you", "i love you.\u201d yeah, exactly", "\u201ci love you.\u201d i had this one girl at one show in san francisco just so drunk, just cross-eyed", "and for the 90 minutes i was on stage goes, \u201ci love you", "i love you so much", "i love you.\u201d and i was just like, \u201clady, all you\u2019re doing is making me want to hit you in the head with this microphone stand", "your affection is not welcome here.\u201d and everybody else is staring at this woman", "but this is a genuine expression of emotion for this person that is destroying my joy completely", "so, i really have a habit of just not talking to hecklers", "what did you do in that case", "did you ignore her", "i think that i kept saying, \u201cthank you", "that\u2019s super sweet", "shut the fuck up.\u201d like, \u201cclearly, you weren\u2019t hugged enough as a child.\u201d i just eventually got mean because it was just like i couldn\u2019t get this woman to stop talking", "and i think the people around her got embarrassed, and they eventually shut her up which was nice", "and i\u2019m trying to think if there are any other really good hecklers that \u2013 oh, i had one guy", "and it\u2019s a mental discipline too because again, it\u2019s your show", "you have the microphone", "you\u2019re in control", "i think the audience thinks they\u2019re in control, but they\u2019re not", "the bill burr scenario is a perfect example", "the person with the microphone has all the power", "and as long as they cannot be moved, they will eventually win", "but i had this one guy who was sitting really close to the stage", "it was a group of 12 people", "and they were all laughing their asses off", "and then he was just arms crossed, just looked like he had just eaten a big scoop of fecal matter", "and he was all i could see", "the whole audience disappeared, and it was just straight vignette on this guy\u2019s sourpussed face", "it was just wrecking my whole night", "and i finally just said, \u201cif you don\u2019t wanna be here, just fucking go, man", "i\u2019ll give you your money back", "i cannot look at your face for one more minute.\u201d and i meant it", "it wasn\u2019t even a joke", "i was just like, \u201cget out, man", "you are harshing my mellow so hard.\u201d and he left", "and i didn\u2019t feel bad about it", "and then i went on with the show, and his girlfriend goes, \u201che had a bad day.\u201d i was like, \u201coh [inaudible] \u201d but what was great was nobody else at the table wanted to leave", "they were like, \u201cgood riddance to bad rubbish.\u201d and he went on, and the rest of the people enjoyed their night", "but again, that was me", "i should have been disciplined enough not to be distracted by old sourpuss", "but i\u2019m only human", "if the grinch is sitting in the front row, something must be done", "when you were just getting started, how did you get better at comedy", "and what i mean by that is you\u2019re very smart", "like you mentioned, matrix capable", "did you do any type of post-game analysis", "did you watch video of yourself", "did you watch video of other comics", "how did you hone your craft", "or maybe a better question is what helped the most in honing your craft", "right", "that\u2019s a good question", "it\u2019s interesting", "i think that there\u2019s a definite math to comedy", "and then there\u2019s also a secondary ineffability", "and i guess what i mean is you can learn how to be a better comic, but you can\u2019t learn how to be a comic", "or even a different way, i really wanted to be an engineer", "and i could have really suffered and struggled through the elevated math that i would need to become an engineer", "but it would never be effortless for me", "and i think with comedy, there are people who, very workmanlike, can learn how to do comedy", "and then there are some people who are just naturally comedic", "and they still have to work to be better at it", "usain bolt still has to train", "even though he was born with more fast [inaudible]\u00a0than everybody else, he still has to train to become a champion", "so, i feel like with comedy, people can be the class clown", "or they can be that guy who\u2019s naturally funny", "there\u2019s still a methodology, and there\u2019s still a mathematics to becoming a comic", "and then at the same time, if they have this ephemeral, ineffable understanding of the math of comedy, they\u2019re gonna be able to do something magical with those skills", "so, for me, i don\u2019t know that i thought i was a funny kid, but i was an observer", "and i was really nerdy and a little bit of a social pariah", "so, storytelling became a way to make friends", "to ingratiate myself, i would try to talk my way into situations or if i was in a social situation, talk really fast to try to keep myself engaging, not be rejected", "so, that was what i brought to it was that combination of being an outsider and an observer and then using those skills to try to connect with people", "but with comedy, i never took any classes", "i never read any books", "there are definitely people who can say there\u2019s a total methodology to comedy", "it\u2019s the rule of threes and stretching reality to the point of breaking but not past it", "there are some specific rules", "what\u2019s the rule of threes", "the rule of threes is that \u2013 [crosstalk] definitely maintain your train of thought", "but \u2013 right", "i probably won\u2019t even be able to articulate it properly", "it\u2019s just that if you\u2019re gonna do a series of jokes or a series of builds to a punchline, it needs to be three because \u2013 and also, if you\u2019re going to do any kind of a diversion, if you\u2019re gonna lead people in one direction, then snap around to a different absurdist result, you can\u2019t do that in two", "it has to be \u2013 the pace of it has to be three", "and then past three, you\u2019re starting to draw things out too long", "but two doesn\u2019t give people enough of a time to be lulled into a false sense of security before you pull the rug out from under them", "and as soon as you start explaining the math of comedy, none of it makes any sense", "it\u2019s those two things", "someone who\u2019s really gifted at physics, they know that there are rules, but still, they see things that other people can\u2019t see", "they see the world as numbers and data", "and the rest of us are just table, chair, water, stick", "so, i guess the way that i did it was that i \u2013 i\u2019m also really an undisciplined comedian", "and what i mean is \u2013 there\u2019s a documentary about garry shandling out right now which i haven\u2019t watched", "but i\u2019m sure that this is in there because he was very famous for being a really disciplined writer", "he would get up, and he would write every single day", "and sometimes it would be pages of material without fail", "other comics would be like, \u201chey, let\u2019s get a beer.\u201d he\u2019d be like, \u201cno", "i have to write.\u201d and every day he would write on this legal \u2013 this is probably true and apocryphal at the same time \u2013 on this legal lined notebook in this tiny handwriting", "and he would just write and write and write and write", "i do not do that", "i\u2019ve never worked that way", "i just get on stage", "i try a bunch of stuff", "i keep what works", "i know what works", "i already know right away what works", "i\u2019ll run off stage", "i\u2019ll write down the things that i knew hit", "i\u2019ll write down the things i know didn\u2019t hit", "and then i\u2019ll go back and try it again dropping the stuff that wasn\u2019t good and putting new stuff in", "i record my sets, but i never \u2013 i cannot listen to my own voice", "so, i have hours and hours of material on tape that i just have never listened to", "so, i don\u2019t know why i still engage in that behavior when it\u2019s clearly not useful to me", "but i think the more you do it, the more you intuitively understand, \u201cthis is a rich area", "people are connecting with this", "this other stuff\u2026\u201d there\u2019s also something you learn as you move through comedy which is it\u2019s not just important to get a laugh", "does this material say something specific and personal about me", "because when you\u2019re a baby comic, every joke is meaningful to you because you only have eight jokes, right", "and so, even if they\u2019re stupid or juvenile or unsophisticated or valueless or coreless, you\u2019ll still do them because that\u2019s all you have", "and then as you get older, you start to think, \u201cokay", "i wanna have a body of work here", "does this hang together", "does it have a strong point of view", "does it have an identity?\u201d and then those other jokes start to fall away", "and then the material really becomes about trying to tell some kind of a story about yourself and the way you perceive the world", "and then that\u2019s how you shape it", "so, sometimes things that are really funny go away", "things that are less funny stay because they\u2019re more impactful", "does that make sense", "yeah", "it does make sense", "absolutely", "i think that\u2019s true for musicians", "i think it\u2019s true many different artists", "yeah", "probably writers too", "probably for writers", "it\u2019s like, \u201ci\u2019m gonna find a space that really says something about my accumulated understanding and knowledge of the world", "and it\u2019s not just enough to say something", "i need to say something that\u2019s uniquely mine.\u201d and that\u2019s something you can only do by being prolific because you need to be able to let things go in order to figure out what should stay", "definitely", "yeah", "there\u2019s a certain volume to it or thinking of it almost as a funnel", "and i think and i certainly hope for the sake of our \u2013 not to sound like an old man, but i guess that\u2019s what i\u2019m turning into \u2013 for the sake of our \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re all \u2013 we\u2019re all turning into the \u2013 yeah", "society in general", "i would hope just seeing the number of hatchet jobs and the amount of yellow journalism and clickbaiting with pieces that have not been factchecked and so on and takedown pieces of folks who are otherwise doing actually a lot of good in the world but people feeling no compunction about running pieces that get a lot of clicks because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re focused on at some point go from, \u201cwhat can i write that will get the most clicks?\u201d to \u201cwhat can i write that i will be proud of that may or may not \u2013\u201d and i think you can figure out a way to make it a nonbinary decision", "in other words, you can figure out something you can be proud of that is simultaneously likely to find some type of sizable audience", "and i think in the beginning there\u2019s a temptation particularly if you have quit your job, and you\u2019re like, \u201cwhere\u2019s my next red check coming from?\u201d \u201chow can i appeal to the widest number of people possible?\u201d and that\u2019s a very precarious position or mindset to put yourself into if you\u2019re hoping to do anything creatively", "evergreen", "right", "right", "and also, it\u2019s interesting", "when i went to school, we had the honor system", "and you were just expected to hold yourself to a high standard because that was what was right", "it\u2019s just what you did", "you were gonna be called upon to stand behind your work", "and so, you tried to work very hard to make sure that you could defend it", "i don\u2019t think that it\u2019s like we\u2019re any less ethical than we\u2019ve ever been", "it\u2019s just, like you said, our metrics have changed", "and i think that people value fame for fame\u2019s sake rather than for the foundational reasons that people become famous", "and i think that\u2019s the problem", "and i don\u2019t think it just exists in journalism", "i think the people value infamy", "or they can\u2019t distinguish between fame and infamy", "and with a 24-hour news cycle, a bright burst is as meaningful as a slow burn", "and i don\u2019t really know \u2013 i actually don\u2019t really know what we do or what should be done or what should happen to counteract that other than people start to maybe get hip to it and start rejecting baseless journalism and \u2013 it\u2019s just so hard to distin \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "let me take that back", "i find it very easy to distinguish between things that seem like they\u2019ve been thoroughly vetted and things that are bullshit", "but i think that people are working very hard to make it harder for the rest of us to distinguish between the two", "so, without me sounding like a crazy person, there are nefarious forces at work trying to make it very hard for us to figure out what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real", "and i think we have to start to raise people who are just more critical thinkers", "but it\u2019s hard to be a critical thinker when you\u2019re just scrolling through your instagram feed looking at butts and cupcakes all day long", "have you been watching my feed", "are you looking over my shoulder", "are you one of the nefarious forces", "i\u2019m following you, and i know what you\u2019re into", "i see what you\u2019re into, tim", "oh, jesus", "oh, god", "oh, god", "i\u2019ll admit, there was a day \u2013 and you would think supposedly being a tech investor and all this stuff for ten years that i would figure this out", "there was a day when i was scrolling through cupcakes and thongs, and i looked up at my profile, and i was like, \u201cwait a minute", "people can see what i follow?\u201d and i was like, \u201coh, fuck.\u201d fortunately, i\u2019ve systematically dismantled and deliberately tarnished any semblance of any reputation i might have very deliberately so that i feel \u2013 [crosstalk] i wanna start interviewing you now", "this is so interesting", "yeah, so that i don\u2019t feel i have any stepford wives, polished persona \u2013 yeah, any kind of perfection to maintain", "\u2013 to preserve", "it\u2019s like \u2013 that\u2019s so good", "and that\u2019s so interesting to me", "and it\u2019s different than just being a slob", "what you\u2019re saying is, \u201ci refuse to create a box within which i will be kept by others.\u201d and i think that comes also from a curiosity about the world", "i actually think that people who are trying to remain perfect all the time are fear-driven", "that\u2019s not a position of strength", "people think they\u2019re maintaining a position of strength when they\u2019re trying to maintain an appearance of perfection, but that is, by its very nature, a posture of fear which is, \u201ci cannot be seen to have imperfections", "i cannot be seen to have flaws", "there can be no chinks in my armor.\u201d and that\u2019s, \u201ci\u2019m terrified of being judged.\u201d but there is something very liberating \u2013 and i think it comes from age as well and from experience", "and i don\u2019t mean experience like a resume but just having experiences to realize how little you know and how the only way to learn is to constantly be skinning your knees and that that doesn\u2019t go away", "the older you get, the more you know that you know very little and that you cannot learn if you are constantly trying to maintain a posture of perfection", "that\u2019s why i\u2019m a total mess", "well, if you don\u2019t practice skinning your knees \u2013 just to really bleed the metaphor for all its worth, if you don\u2019t practice skinning your knees, you\u2019re not gonna develop the callus for increasingly painful grades of sandpaper", "this is really awkwardly overextended now", "but the point being, if you operate from a place of fear and want to please this nebulous majority more than you want to please yourself \u2013 and that\u2019s not to say that i\u2019ve always viewed my entire life and all my decisions as a singular locust of control in the palm of my hand and i care what no one thinks", "that\u2019s not true because that\u2019s not how humans have evolved", "but if you are deferring to your perception of what others want on the small things, then it\u2019s gonna become harder on the medium things and then impossible", "and then it\u2019s gonna become harder and impossible on the big things", "and for that reason, i find it very valuable to deliberately expose yourself to different types and levels of discomfort so that you can actually stand up for the important stuff when it matters because if you don\u2019t practice on the smaller stuff \u2013 for instance, if i\u2019m so humiliated by the fact that i like gorgeous female asses, and i\u2019m like, \u201coh, my god,\u201d and i put something up about \u2013 i put up this picture", "so, this is what i do occasionally when i\u2019m like, \u201cyou know what", "i think i\u2019m getting a little fat and happy and complacent", "and maybe i have too much phomo or something like that", "i remember at one point, i put up this photo of this gorgeous, latin ass, female, and it said, \u201cnalgofilia.\u201d anyway, i think it was nalgofilia", "anyway, los nalgas is ass in spanish", "so, i put this up on instagram", "so, it was spanish for assman is what you\u2019re saying", "that\u2019s right", "it\u2019s famous for assman syndrome or assman disorder", "and i put it up", "and as to be expected, there is immediate outrage", "there are plenty of people who think it\u2019s kind of funny", "plenty of people who are like, \u201cyeah, high-five.\u201d and then there are plenty of other people who are just completely outraged", "disgusted with you", "yeah", "disgusted with this fact that i find attractive women attractive", "yes", "outrageous contagious", "yeah", "but i left it up because i like to cull my audience, no", "1", "yes", "yes", "\u201cif you don\u2019t wanna be here, please", "i invite you to unfollow.\u201d yeah, exactly", "right", "it\u2019s like the sourpuss in the front row", "it\u2019s like, \u201clet me give you a \u2013 you look like you\u2019re unhappy, but you\u2019re still here", "and let me give you another reason to leave if i\u2019m not your thing because go find something that\u2019s your thing.\u201d yeah", "people assume that their opinion is valuable to you", "i think there\u2019s a freedom in saying, \u201ci don\u2019t need everybody to like me.\u201d you know what i mean", "i think that there is something very meaningful in saying, \u201cthis is who i am", "i\u2019ll defend it", "but i\u2019m not here to be savaged by you", "and honestly, we don\u2019t know each other", "i don\u2019t care what you think anyway.\u201d or maybe that person makes you think more critically about what you did, and then you take the big booty picture down", "i don\u2019t know", "but i think you put it up purposefully to see what you were gonna get back which was entertaining", "i totally did", "now there are cases \u2013 just so i don\u2019t sound like a complete dick", "there are other cases where i put something up without really thinking about it", "and i do get feedback and realize, \u201cyou know what", "that\u2019s actually a really insensitive thing to put up", "and i didn\u2019t think it through", "take it down.\u201d and there are cases when i do that", "and people give you hopefully constructive feedback that isn\u2019t just spitting acid into my face", "and i take it down", "so, i do pay attention", "at the same time, i try to keep in mind advice that i was given years ago", "i don\u2019t remember who gave me this advice, but the advice was, \u201cit\u2019s not about how many people don\u2019t get it", "it\u2019s about how many people get it.\u201d so, as long as you have a certain critical mass, whatever that means to you \u2013 and there\u2019s an article called \u201c1,000 true fans,\u201d by kevin kelly that everybody should read to this effect if you\u2019re creative", "but as long as you have a critical mass \u2013 and it can be a very small number \u2013 of people who love your stuff, that\u2019s all that matters", "that\u2019s a pass/fail", "as long as you have that, pass", "you\u2019re green", "and instead of focusing on the vast majority who hate your shit, it\u2019s like, \u201clook, there are millions of people who hate christopher nolan\u2019s stuff", "there are millions of people who can\u2019t stand wes anderson.\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201clook, some people just aren\u2019t going to fucking like wes anderson.\u201d exactly", "exactly", "so, this is really interesting also because i think if you\u2019re an artist specifically, this is a really important conversation to have with yourself which is \u2013 when i first started, i did standup", "this was the period when def comedy jam was really popular", "and for lack of a better way of articulating it, black comedy had a very specific look and feel and style and tempo", "and i just wasn\u2019t doing that kind of comedy", "and i wasn\u2019t ever going to be able to do that kind of comedy", "it wasn\u2019t who i was", "it wasn\u2019t experientially what i was doing", "and i didn\u2019t wanna lie", "and i knew there were comedians who were falling into that stylistic approach to comedy, and it was really very false", "they\u2019d be one way off stage and then fall into this character on stage", "and there\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to connect with an audience", "but i just didn\u2019t wanna copy other people to try to get people to like me", "and for a long time, i really struggled", "and then eventually, my tribe found me", "but i was able to stay \u2013 oh, now i sound like a self-help book \u2013 but true to who i was because that was the only way forward", "the only way forward as an artist is to be truthful", "in the end, your work is not going to be interesting or meaningful if you are trying to emulate somebody else or trying to figure out what people want from you or what they like or what\u2019s popular", "meaningful art only lasts, it only connects if it\u2019s authentic and if it comes from your own personal experiences", "and until you figure that out, what that is, it\u2019s never gonna be interesting", "it\u2019s never going to be good", "and i always tell people being funny is not really actually the most important part of comedy", "being truthful is because if someone sees a good show, they go, \u201cthat guy was really funny.\u201d but when you tell the truth about yourself, people go, \u201coh, my god", "holy shit", "that guy spoke to me or about me or was so vulnerable in that moment", "that was amazing.\u201d and that\u2019s the difference between good comedy and great comedy or between good art and great art or writing or anything", "yeah, it\u2019s truth", "that\u2019s advice that i\u2019ve also heard for screenwriting and many other things", "i\u2019m so glad you said that and reminded me of that", "yeah", "you have to please yourself", "you just have to please yourself, period, because it might not go your way anyway", "but the worst thing is creating some \u2013 [inaudible]\u00a0figure out what people want and then creating some piece of shit, some crass, glib, solicitous piece of shit, and people don\u2019t buy it anyway", "why not make something you love and then people don\u2019t buy it", "at least it was something that you loved, and you\u2019re not embarrassed by it", "right", "and you said it may not work out", "and if you\u2019re in the creative game, at least from what i\u2019ve seen, particularly in the beginning, most things are not going to work out", "yeah", "nothing ever goes your way", "right", "so, you might as well have one person who\u2019s happy about the process", "exactly", "exactly", "that was what i was saying about engagement", "at least the experience was satisfying", "and i would also \u2013 i feel like i\u2019m talking too much, so i\u2019m gonna stop in a second", "no, no", "[inaudible] but the other thought i might underscore for folks that is practical, tactical from a competitive standpoint: if you\u2019re trying to play someone else\u2019s game by taking on a persona, someone who is actually \u2013 for instance, in the def comedy jam example that you gave, if somebody\u2019s on stage, and they\u2019re playing their game, that is who they are, you are never going to be able to take on the cognitive load and the fatigue of pretending to be that type of person and beat someone who is good at that game", "you\u2019re just not going to", "you\u2019re so right", "yeah", "you\u2019re just not gonna win", "so, you will not ultimately, in any field that is competitive which is effectively every field that people get paid for \u2013 if you wanna be the best, you have to harness your latent abilities, or you\u2019re fucked", "you mentioned on the engineering front \u2013 there\u2019s so many places where \u2013 for instance, in writing, i could try to be john mcphee who writes for the new yorker or one of these folks", "but i can\u2019t be those people", "i\u2019m not going to ever be the wordsmith that say, a tolstoy was", "but do i like teaching", "do i obsessively think about teaching and deconstructing things that are complex", "i do", "so, i can use books as a medium for teaching and think of it that way because if i try to be \u2013 if i try to out mcphee mcphee, i\u2019m gonna get my face ripped off", "we\u2019re talking about creativity and creative pursuits which, by the way, almost everything is", "if you meet people who are at the top of their game in accounting, the top of the game \u2013 and i\u2019m not talking about shady money laundering shit", "i\u2019m just saying in accounting, in technology, there\u2019s certainly an element of creativity, if you\u2019re looking at the people who are really at the top and innovating in any way doing exceptional work", "you have done so many different things: acting, comedy, directing, writing, activism", "you\u2019ve been a host", "you\u2019ve done voiceover", "you\u2019ve engaged in so many different acts of creation", "i wanna talk about short films, films, and so on", "i wanna talk about movies because as long-term listeners will know, i\u2019ve been teasing with the idea \u2013 which, by the way, just means procrastinating \u2013 of writing some short films", "and i\u2019m still at step zero", "and i\u2019m ashamed of that", "but \u2013 no shame", "there\u2019s no shame in this \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah", "so, how did you decide to get into film", "and why", "film is hard", "why do it", "it is hard", "it is tough", "yeah", "so, that\u2019s a really good question because i feel like there\u2019s that really humiliating clam about, \u201cwell, i\u2019m an actor", "but what i really wanna do is direct.\u201d and it feels very clich\u00e9d", "i feel like it was more organic for me because again, i wasn\u2019t someone who \u2013 i didn\u2019t go to film school", "and i also don\u2019t think i had the hubris to think like, \u201coh, i\u2019ve done this for a couple years now", "i can direct.\u201d i had written someth \u2013 i love movies", "we were talking about earlier i was raised by a single dad", "and i was one of those kids who i\u2019d go with my dad to see die hard or road warrior way too early in age", "super inappropriate", "when i was in high school, i\u2019d seen the first terminator something like 20 or 30 times", "i just loved movies", "i\u2019d go to the theater", "i\u2019d buy a matinee ticket, and i\u2019d stay in the theater until 8:00 at night, and i would just watch movie after movie after movie", "so, it just came out of a real end-user\u2019s love for film", "i was just someone who was transported by movies", "and then when i left talk soup, i had been writing on that show", "and there was a void", "and i wrote a script that i was developing with a company", "and i just kept talking about how i thought it should look and how i thought it should feel", "and it was just so much more specific than being a writer", "and they were like, \u201cyou should direct", "this is clearly a movie that you should direct.\u201d and i hadn\u2019t really thought about it", "but i was just so intertwined with the material and what i wanted it to feel like because i know what movies that i love make me feel like that i wanted someone to create that experience for other people", "and i just realized i didn\u2019t know what directing entailed", "i didn\u2019t have any idea about what that was gonna be like", "and i just went away and started trying to learn about directing", "and so, i would call people that i knew that were directors", "if i was working on something, i would ask to come back to set when i wasn\u2019t working so i could hang out and shadow which is where you just hang around behind a director and watch them work", "and ended up shadowing with some really incredible people", "i ended up spending several days on the wire in its last season and just got to just be on the other side of a process that can be relatively opaque when you\u2019re an actor", "you just show up and say your lines and leave", "and then i started making shorts", "and i guess this is gonna sound very glib, but \u2013 because i\u2019m sure i have the resources available to me that lots of people don\u2019t", "but i do believe in \u2013 i just believe in personal aggression", "i just believe in doing stuff", "you said personal aggression", "personal aggression", "i just believe that if you wanna make a movie, just start making a movie", "and i don\u2019t mean go get a camera and start shooting it", "but what i do mean is be hard on yourself", "learn, read, learn, watch, study, think critically, ask people questions, and then make a movie, and then let it be shitty", "and then make another one", "and let that one be shitty", "and keep doing it until you get better at it", "the first short film i made was \u2013 and it\u2019s an abomination", "it will never see the light of day", "i had no idea what i was doing", "but that didn\u2019t make me not wanna be a director", "it just made me realize i needed to learn more", "and then i started to feel like i was more ready", "and i was like, \u201ci need to make some stuff.\u201d so, first thing was i did a comedy central special, and i took the money that would have been my salary, and i used it to make a little short music video that opens the comedy special", "it wasn\u2019t anything that was mandated by the network", "i was like, \u201ci wanna do something different.\u201d so, i wrote the song, and i performed it", "and i made a music video", "and that was the first thing i directed", "i just used the crew that was already working on the special and shot this video with them", "that\u2019s really smart", "so, i would imagine \u2013 not to interject \u2013 but you piggybacked on something that was in your main line of business, so to speak", "exactly", "and i imagine you saved a lot of costs by doing that, right", "yeah", "the crew was already gonna come up the day before and leave the day after to shoot the special", "and we\u2019d already rented the cameras and everything like that", "but i still had to pay them for the extra work", "i just took my fee, and i used it to pay everybody else", "and then because i didn\u2019t have any more money after that, i learned how to edit", "and i edited it myself", "and i delivered it to the network because i couldn\u2019t afford to pay for additional edit time", "and then after that i thought, \u201cokay", "i wanna do more of this.\u201d so, then i rented a camera", "i rented a can of 5d", "and i had some friends who were in bands", "and again, it sounds fancy, but everybody probably knows somebody who does something", "just because i had some friends who were in a famous band doesn\u2019t mean that people out there don\u2019t have friends who are in bands", "so, i just called some buddies of mine that were in bands", "and i said, \u201chey, if you let me come on tour with you, i will make you a free music video", "just a piece of fan art", "you can use it however you like", "i\u2019m not gonna charge anybody any money for it", "but i wanna make something, and i wanna make something for you.\u201d and so, i ended up going on the road with silversun pickups for a couple of dates and then spending a day with clutch when they were performing in anaheim", "and then i just gave them \u2013 i just cut music videos and delivered it to them", "and so, then i just started to have examples of what i could do", "why music videos instead of something else", "it just felt like a way to get more people to see it", "i had done that first music video for my comedy central special which was really a comedic video", "but then i was like, \u201coh, i really like working in this space.\u201d and a lot of directors come out of music video because you can be radically creative in that space", "you don\u2019t need to have any narrative linearity", "you can experiment", "you can be radical", "it could just be a series of images", "and i also thought, \u201cwell, people who like this band \u2013 and i love this band \u2013 will wanna see something about them", "and it\u2019ll be a great way for people to see something", "and then hopefully, i can tell a story at the same time.\u201d and so, i did three of those", "and then i did a little action short", "i just kept making stuff", "every time i did it, i learned something", "or every time i did it, i took a bigger risk, creatively", "how long are these shorts", "like three to five minutes", "three to five minutes", "can you think of any particular lessons that you took away from any one of those", "yeah", "i think a lot of it was just skill building like, \u201chow do you frame up", "and how do you make choices", "and how do you do coverage", "and then how do you edit?\u201d a lot of it was just really practical \u2013 as you would say, practical, tactical.\u201d oh, god", "i have my pet phrases", "this is also my weakness", "i remember i heard that", "i\u2019m like, \u201ci\u2019m gonna steal it", "stealing it from tim.\u201d my pet phrases", "oh, god", "and then a lot of it was just getting confident with my own ability and my ability to articulate what i wanted from other people", "just, \u201chow do the other jobs on a set work", "who does what", "what do i need", "oh, god", "this didn\u2019t work", "you know why it didn\u2019t work", "because i didn\u2019t have this kind of a person on set.\u201d i was shooting digitally", "and then on one show, on one of my things that i shot, we didn\u2019t have a tech on set to help me make sure that it looked the way that i wanted it to look, that the levels were set properly", "so, when i got home to edit it, i had some problems", "but they weren\u2019t catastrophic problems because i wasn\u2019t making star wars", "i was just able to be like, \u201cwell this is what it is", "and i\u2019m gonna make this and move on", "and then i was getting ready to do \u2013 i really wanted to do a feature", "i had some material i\u2019d written, but it was gonna be an expensive movie", "but i was still shadowing", "so, i had a friend who had a show called penny dreadful, john logan who created penny dreadful", "i had met him at comic con", "i had hosted the panel for that show", "and he was like, \u201chey, you love the show", "you should come visit us in ireland.\u201d and i remember thinking to myself, \u201cpeople always say that", "then you always say, \u2018yeah,\u2019 then you never do it.\u201d i was like, \u201ci\u2019m gonna do it", "i\u2019m fucking going to ireland, man", "i\u2019m gonna be cool", "i\u2019m gonna be the cool kid for once in my life.\u201d and so, i ended up going over, visiting penny dreadful", "and vikings shot right up the road", "so, i got them to let me visit that set", "i just hung out and passed out sandwiches and lifted stuff and asked questions and watched them work", "and then while i was over there, i met a bunch of irish actors", "and two of them actually \u2013 one was an actor, composer, and one was a screenwriter and an actor", "and we ended up making a short film together in ireland at the end of 2014", "that was my first narrative short, my first story driven short", "and it was just great", "i was like, \u201coh, this is totally who i am", "this is what i wanna do with my life.\u201d where did you film in ireland", "do you recall", "in galway which is \u2013 [crosstalk] beautiful town", "\u2013 coast", "yeah", "such a great place", "i lived there for a month in 2005", "oh, did you", "oh, yeah", "amazing", "oh, that\u2019s so cool", "yeah", "an incredible arts festival there", "it\u2019s a really beautiful spot", "yeah, it is", "it\u2019s like the arts center of ireland", "they\u2019ve got a beautiful film festival in the summer", "they\u2019ve got an arts festival with local theater", "it was just a great experience", "and things went wrong, and things went right", "but we got it in the can in three days", "and it was just super cool and personal", "and then that same writer who had written that short had a feature he had already written", "and he asked me if i wanted to take a look at it", "and it was just a perfect first film", "and that\u2019s the film that became axis", "okay", "so, i want to dig into axis", "but before we get to that, you\u2019re taking these trips, doing these music videos", "during that period, did you save up for that period knowing that you would need to work out of your savings", "are you depending on royalties and other streams to pay your bills", "how are you covering the necessities of life as you are handing out sandwiches and doing all these various things", "well, it wasn\u2019t as prolonged of a period as it sounds like", "i was on hiatus", "so, i was working on the talk at the time", "and we get a month off every year", "so, i went in that month", "but i think if i was talking to a layperson who didn\u2019t work in television, i would say, \u201cif what you want is to grow in whatever field you\u2019re interested in, just create a space for that", "make that your vacation.\u201d it wasn\u2019t like i was riding around in a limousine", "i just flew over, and i hung around for a week and watched people work", "and it wasn\u2019t any more or less burdensome than taking a vacation", "but one thing i was more interested in doing as i got older \u2013 and we started with this in the beginning", "you said it, and i think we went past it", "but it\u2019s so interesting to me \u2013 was that i just really wanted more discomfort in my life", "it\u2019s just very easy the older you get to be like, \u201cget in car", "go to work", "eat bagged lunch", "get in car", "go to gym", "go home", "eat food", "watch tv", "go to bed.\u201d and then you just think, \u201cam i growing", "is any of this interesting", "i have one life, and i\u2019m just spending it in this torpor.\u201d and so, for that, i was going to a place where \u2013 i knew one guy at penny dreadful, but i didn\u2019t know anybody at this other show", "and i just cold called them and said, \u201ccan i come visit?\u201d and they were super gracious", "and \u2013 just to interrupt you yet again, what does that email say", "it says, \u201chi.\u201d and again, i understand that maybe this is gonna feel a little rarified", "\u201chi", "i\u2019m an american actress", "i\u2019ve worked on these shows", "i\u2019ve been shadowing to direct for a long time", "i would be really grateful if i could come and visit your show for a few days and shadow", "and i will be as unobtrusive and invisible as i possibly can", "and i\u2019ll be here these days", "and i understand if you can\u2019t accommodate me, but i\u2019d really be grateful.\u201d and i think it helped in my particular case because i had tweeted a lot about how much i loved vikings", "so, they knew that i was a big fan of the show", "and i did some tweeting from set", "i paid my way in flacking their show for them", "but \u2013 i\u2019m not over-caffeinated", "i swear to god", "you\u2019re making so many important points that i just want to pause and help \u2013 well, as much for myself as anyone else", "just people to reflect on", "so, what you did in terms of tweeting, people might say, \u201cwell, i don\u2019t have a verified account", "and nobody\u2019s gonna pay attention to one tweet in the twitter feed of 10,000 if it\u2019s a popular tv show.\u201d but i can tell you from personal experience that you could, for instance, write something for a medium or for fill-in-the-blank outlet that has a high google \u2013 in other words, page rank, and that many of the producers, actors, and so on will have google alerts or other alerts set that deliver to their inboxes relevant media that mentions say, the show or the actors", "and you do not need to be a famous actress or an author or any of those things to do that", "all you need to do is work at the highest possible caliber of quality that you can", "i think you also touched on this about the idea that people are more interested in being expeditious than they are in being good", "i think that this holds very, very true for this business", "a lot of people have made headway because they did something that nobody saw", "but when people asked them what they did, the thing they were able to show was extraordinary", "and i don\u2019t mean expensive extraordinary", "i just mean unique and personal and crafted with care", "and so, if that\u2019s something that you wrote or if it\u2019s something that you made \u2013 this is not the best example, but it\u2019s a good one", "20 years ago, there was this videotape going around hollywood of these guys in an apartment", "and it was a vhs tape", "that\u2019s how long ago it was", "and people were dubbing it and giving it to friends of these guys in an apartment", "it was these three black guys where the one guy goes up and hits the little intercom and goes, \u201cwazza?\u201d and then the other guy goes, \u201cwazza?\u201d and the third guy \u2013 that was a short film that some guy made on a digital camera", "none of them were famous", "they were just some guys in new york", "that ended up being that budweiser campaign", "that\u2019s crazy", "i had no idea that was the origin", "it was a short film", "and it was a two and a half minute short film that was just funny", "we didn\u2019t know these guys", "no one knew who they were", "and they didn\u2019t have any connections", "and i think it was just about doing something that felt original and personal", "and i get it", "it just comes back to don\u2019t try to figure out what people want", "just do what\u2019s interesting and important to you", "and then keep doing it until you come up with something extraordinary", "and that will be your calling card", "it may not happen as fast as you want or as aggressively as you want or as expansively as you want", "but in the meantime, you\u2019re doing cool shit which should be your primary goal in any event", "when i made axis, honestly, i just wanted to make a movie to show people i could make a movie", "i wanted to make the best movie i could", "and i was very rigorous in leveraging the resources that i had to the best of my ability", "but i don\u2019t know that i had a lot of expectation that a lot of people would see it", "it\u2019s just because i made the best movie i could that it got all of this attention", "but i don\u2019t think i was going in like, \u201cthis is gonna be a massive hit.\u201d i was like, \u201ci\u2019m gonna make this little movie", "and then to the next one, when people say, \u2018well, what have you done?\u2019 i can be like, \u2018look at this little thing i made.\u2019\u201d so, i think you have to always be focused on the thing and not the result because the result is directly tied to the quality of the thing", "so, it\u2019s not about infamy", "it\u2019s about fame", "and fame is based on the quality of your work", "so, just be doing excellent shit all the time", "and eventually, one of those things will connect with other people", "yeah", "not to sound like a fortune cookie on top of all of that, but the only uncrowded market is great", "there\u2019s always a fucking market for great", "and \u2013 exactly", "and \u2013 go ahead", "radically too", "be radically great", "don\u2019t be like, \u201ci saw ten things like this", "let me do the 11th thing.\u201d be brave enough to court failure", "that\u2019s probably when you\u2019re going to do something great", "absolutely", "and if you are really in love with something \u2013 i\u2019ll give two examples", "if you\u2019re really in love with, say, screenplays and film, or if you\u2019re really in love and passionate about \u2013 maybe is a better word \u2013 possessed by technology investing, early stage technology investing, two phenomena, two companies at this point, certainly that are worth looking at and just investigating the stories of demonstrate very clearly what you can do if you are just rejected by the establishment or if you want to not operate within the existing power structure", "and so, the two examples are the black list", "look up franklin leonard and the black list", "oh, god", "yeah", "that\u2019s a terrific example", "absolutely", "and then the second is \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to get into both of these right now", "the second is \u2013 just by coincidence also has the list at the end \u2013 but angellist and naval ravikant", "and people can look up the \u2013 well, \u201cthe avenging angel\u201d was the title of his interview in his alumni magazine at dartmouth, in fact", "but i get excited when i hear these types of stories", "so, they should check them out", "so, let\u2019s come back to axis", "what is axis", "and did you have anybody try to talk you out of doing axis", "oh, that\u2019s such a good question", "so, axis is a thriller about an ex-patriot irish actor living in los angeles who has had a lot of success, explosive success in his youth and has really just used all of his resources to just wreck his life", "he\u2019s a drunk, and he\u2019s a drug addict", "and he\u2019s terrible at relationships", "and he\u2019s a dick to everybody", "and when we meet him, he\u2019s trying to turn his life around", "and it\u2019s really about a guy who\u2019s not a bad person, but he\u2019s done some bad stuff, which i think almost every human being can relate to", "we all have a little bit of a demon inside of us", "and i think this is just a guy who\u2019s been \u2013 he\u2019s been frail in the past, but he\u2019s really trying to be a better version of himself", "but slowly, over the course of an afternoon \u2013 and the movie takes place in real time as he\u2019s driving through los angeles, his life starts to unravel", "and it\u2019s really about him trying to hold things together, trying to be a better person, trying to be a better person in his relationships with his family, with the people that he works with, just trying to be better", "it\u2019s really dark", "it\u2019s very funny", "i\u2019m sure i\u2019ll get some letters about this", "but i happen to find that addicts are really entertaining people", "and i don\u2019t mean their funny like laugh at them", "i find that typically people who have broken themselves down are just more honest than people who are trying to be perfect all the time", "and so, he\u2019s a guy who\u2019s self-aware", "he\u2019s aware of the mistakes he\u2019s made", "so, it\u2019s a very darkly funny movie", "and then it\u2019s very twisty", "it\u2019s a thriller, so it\u2019s got a lot of secrets", "and the most unique aspect of the movie is that the whole thing takes place in real time inside a car as he\u2019s driving through los angeles", "so, the lead actor is the only actor on screen", "and all the other actors are voice actors on the phone with him", "how would you describe your experience of being involved with this film", "it was so wonderful", "you asked if people tried to dissuade me from doing it, and the short answer is in hollywood, the way that people dissuade you from doing stuff is just by not helping you, by not engaging with you because you don\u2019t even get, \u201cno.\u201d you just get silence", "but this happened very quickly", "so, i didn\u2019t have a traditional discouraging period of frustration with trying to put this movie together because i read it in august or september of 2015", "and i was at peak engagement at that time in terms of work", "i was on four shows", "and i really only had a little bit of time off in 2016", "and i realized if i didn\u2019t make the movie in this one single week in may of 2016 that i wasn\u2019t gonna be able to make it at all in that year and i\u2019d have to push to the next year", "and so, then it just became about hitting that target like, \u201chow can i hit this target?\u201d so, i never even went the traditional way of trying to find people to finance the movie and a studio because they were gonna say, \u201cwe don\u2019t know who this actor is", "he\u2019s unknown", "can we put somebody famous in this role", "can it be ryan gosling", "can it not be with just him on camera", "can we have other actors in the movie", "and then can we make it not in a car", "can we make it \u2013\u201d the whole concept of the film was gonna unravel", "that\u2019s very typical in hollywood where people are so risk-averse that they take all of the edge and singularity out of a project", "so, very quickly i realized that i was gonna have to probably crowdfund the movie if i wanted to do it my way and on my timeframe", "so, in march of 2016 i had my first exploratory conversation with the people around me and with kickstarter", "i was able to \u2013 they have people over there who are around to help you figure out how to put a project together", "i built the campaign in three weeks", "i launched it in april", "and one of the rules about crowdfunding and kickstarter, specifically \u2013 it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule", "it\u2019s not a rule that they enforce", "but it\u2019s just a rule of thumb \u2013 that if you raise half of your money in the first week, you\u2019ll probably fund fully", "so, we had raised half of our money in that first week, and then i started hiring people on the film", "and we did raise a lot of money for a feature", "it was about $200,000.00 that we raised", "and so, that was what we had to make the movie", "so, originally, we were gonna make it nine days", "but i realized if i made it faster, i\u2019d have more money available to me daily", "my daily resource load would be higher", "so, we cut the schedule from nine days to seven days which is incredibly aggressive for a feature", "whenever i tell people i made it in seven days they ask, \u201cis it a short?\u201d so, we had to be really aggressive", "we ended up doing it in this way that was so terrifying and so breakneck but so exhilarating which is that we shot the first 15 pages of the movie in the first day", "and then we shot the next 65 pages of the movie", "we shot about 17 pages on the first day and about 67 pages on day two through seven", "and that meant that the actor had to do 67 pages of dialogue a day", "for people that don\u2019t know, typically, on a movie you do between three and six pages of dialogue a day", "so, he was essentially doing the entire movie all the way through every day locked in a hot car with no air conditioning in may, beginning of june, essentially in los angeles", "and it was just so intense", "but we shot three cameras", "so, by day three, we essentially had the entire movie in the can because we were doing the whole thing all the way through from three angles", "so, by day two, we had six angles", "and we had the whole movie on \u2013 not on wax", "on the digital version of wax", "and so, then the next four days were just about creative play", "and i think that what the result is is i made a movie in a week", "it\u2019s experimental", "it\u2019s unusual", "it\u2019s transporting and strange", "and going in, i thought, \u201ci\u2019ll never make a movie this way again.\u201d but now i would make a movie that way again because i just didn\u2019t have any time to be afraid or feel doubt", "there was no time to be anxious", "i just had to go", "it was wonderful", "it was one of the seminal experiences of my life", "there\u2019s definitely some magic in the ether when you have a hyper aggressive deadline", "there\u2019s just something that happens to the spacetime continuum and what you can achieve when everything gets compressed that intensely", "certain things just come to the surface", "certain things are thrown into relief", "and it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t make mistakes, but i think you get a clarity sometimes because you can\u2019t dither", "there\u2019s no time for paralysis by analysis", "i am making this decision", "i\u2019m making it definitively", "it may be the wrong one, but i\u2019m gonna lean all the way into it, and we\u2019re gonna see what happens", "and also because we shot the whole movie all the way through, if there were errors, i had the next day to recalibrate in a way that you don\u2019t get when you typically make a movie", "for people, again, who don\u2019t know, on a \u2013 i\u2019m an actor as well", "so, when i\u2019m on a tv show or i\u2019m doing a movie or whatever, i\u2019ll leave at the end of the day and go, \u201coh, shit, man", "i wish i\u2019d done this with that scene", "i wish i\u2019d tried this.\u201d but every day, the next day, we got to wake up and go, \u201cyou know what", "we have a whole new bite at this apple", "we\u2019re gonna do it a whole different way today.\u201d and so, at the end, i really felt like we really, fully explored the material which we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do if we had been making a movie in seven days and not doing it with this volume approach that we had", "so, i\u2019m looking at text in a book that you contributed to", "happens to be this \u2013 is it a book \u2013 tribe of men", "this fantastic book", "oh, let me see", "here it is", "for those of you who get the \u2013 [crosstalk] for those of you who get the what about bob", "reference, \u201cthere\u2019s this groundbreaking new book", "oh, yes", "here it is.\u201d and there\u2019s an entire shelf of the therapist\u2019s own book, richard dreyfuss", "in any case, the question to what you would put on a gigantic billboard, metaphorically speaking to get a message to millions or billions of people, in this case, what you selected was a jack canfield quote", "\u201ceverything you want is on the other side of fear.\u201d and many of the stories that you\u2019ve told so far illustrate that, certainly", "what are you afraid of now", "or what fear are you hoping, say, in the next year to get on the other side of", "does anything come to mind", "that\u2019s a good question", "it\u2019s interesting because i think the one that feels the most obvious is i\u2019m afraid i won\u2019t get to make another film", "but i\u2019m not really, legitimately afraid of that because i feel like i\u2019m just gonna put this next movie together and make it", "i think now that i\u2019ve done one with no help and no assistance from anybody, the next one\u2019s gonna be cake", "i had help", "i had my team", "but i didn\u2019t have the traditional hollywood help where i had a team of agents making magic", "it was really just a scrappy little group of filmmakers doing this film with me, the lead actor and screenwriter and my creative executives", "it was a small group of people completely outside of the system", "but what am i afraid of", "god, that\u2019s a really good \u2013 and it\u2019s not that i\u2019m fearless", "it may just be that the things that are interesting to me now don\u2019t engender fear the way that they used to", "i can also i think tackle this from a different angle which is what is one of your greatest struggles right now", "what do you struggle with", "oh, god", "if anything", "my main struggle is just always being as effective as i wanna be", "you know what i mean", "i\u2019m just super ambitious", "i have highly developed \u2013 i don\u2019t mean i\u2019m good at it", "i mean it\u2019s very far advanced workaholism", "i have pathological workaholism", "it\u2019s a sickness", "and whenever i say i\u2019m a workaholic, people always laugh", "and i go, \u201clook, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d i don\u2019t know how to rest", "it\u2019s not that i don\u2019t like to play", "i do like play", "but i don\u2019t think i have any time to rest", "and i worry that it makes me \u2013 it could result in me not being an interesting artist because i think you need to play and to daydream and to rest and to experience things to be able to tell interesting stories", "and no one wants to hear about your daily trek from your home to your office", "it\u2019s just not compelling", "well, i remember \u2013 i think it was amanda palmer who said this", "i apologize to whoever said it if i\u2019m misattributing", "but amanda palmer, creative musician extraordinaire", "oh, god", "i think it was her who said, \u201cin order to have \u2013 is she married to neil gaiman", "she is", "yeah", "greatest author of all time", "okay", "yeah", "exactly", "for those of you \u2013 [crosstalk] after you, tim", "after you and after me, then him", "yeah", "yeah", "i will bow at the feet of neil gaiman as a writer", "and everybody should listen to his audiobook of the graveyard book narrated by him", "he has also the most soothing voice imaginable", "but i digress", "what the fuck was i saying", "oh, so amanda palmer has a quote about \u2013 oh, yes", "\u201cif art imitates life, in order to create art, you have to have a life.\u201d yeah", "absolutely", "and i\u2019m paraphrasing", "and it\u2019s butchered", "but makes a point", "but like a radical one", "i\u2019m sure there are other theories", "there\u2019s a very famous french writer", "it\u2019s not [inaudible]\u00a0but it\u2019s somebody anyway about have a bourgeois life and be radical in your work", "but i actually don\u2019t think \u2013 and i actually think that you need to be fully engaged in your life in order to be an interesting artist because you need to be alive to be able to speak about the human condition", "so, if you have advanced early onset workaholism, you\u2019ve really turned this into a default mode, are you doing anything to try and manage that or create more slack in the system for the daydreaming and so on", "that\u2019s my daily practice", "that\u2019s my one day at a time", "it\u2019s just constantly trying to remind myself to rest", "i engage socially a lot more than i used to", "and by socially, you mean out in the real world", "yeah", "out in the real world", "i go out", "and i try to not just be \u2013 i just had a period of life where i was just up, gym, work, sleep", "i just remember one day i was like, \u201ci\u2019m gonna die", "i\u2019m gonna die of boredom", "i bore myself.\u201d you know what i mean", "and so, i think i try to court danger in a safe way", "it\u2019s not like i\u2019m jumping out of a plane with no parachute or bullfighting or bareknuckle brawling in an alley filled with needles", "but i am trying to just not always have my head in my computer", "but look, the reason that people are workaholics \u2013 well, there\u2019s lots of reasons i\u2019m sure", "social pressures", "but for me, i just get this big serotonin release", "is it serotonin", "what\u2019s the satisfaction drug", "is it serotonin", "i would say dopamine, perhaps", "dopamine", "that\u2019s it", "dopamine", "serotonin\u2019s sleepy time", "yeah", "dopamine", "i get a dopamine release when i complete tasks", "and i get higher and higher the more that i execute", "i find executing in and of itself really enjoyable", "so, i\u2019m just trying to apply that aggression to leisure like, \u201ccan i get the same satisfaction from \u2013 if i make a to-do list and one of the things is \u2018have fun,\u2019 will i get the same dopamine release if i have a lot of fun?\u201d how can i turn fun into work most effectively", "yeah, and then be like, \u201ci don\u2019t know about you guys, but i just fucking crushed my to do list", "what?\u201d i realize that even though i can feel very harried, it\u2019s interesting to me to be feeling like a part of being on this planet is fully engaging and doing everything i can do and everything i\u2019m interested in because i don\u2019t wanna look back and be like, \u201cman, i should have tried that.\u201d i\u2019m happy to look back and say, \u201cman, i tried that, and it went terribly for me.\u201d that\u2019s a perfectly comfortable space for me to be like, \u201cman, i tried that", "and i completely shit the bed.\u201d but what i find very uncomfortable is the idea that i always wanted to do something and i never did it", "and so, that\u2019s what i fear", "what i fear is not trying, not experiencing all the things that i wanna experience", "how do you think you \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah", "how do you think your life \u2013 because you live so aggressively", "you milk the most out of the hours that you have", "how would you or your life be different if you didn\u2019t have exercise as an element do you think", "well, it\u2019s interesting because i really love working out", "but there\u2019s a constant battle for me between being effective with work and \u2013 i\u2019m the queen of getting up at 5:00 a.m", "to work out, putting on my workout clothes and then being in front of my computer at 4:00 in the afternoon and i haven\u2019t moved",

with everything, all of the stimuli that we experience nowadays, all of the pictures and the images of perfection that are coming in at a much faster and more voluminous pace, it\u2019s really easy to fall into an abusive relationship with exercise, either doing it so much that you\u2019re hurting yourself or not doing it and then engaging in that inner monologue about how you\u2019re worthless and you can\u2019t get your shit together", "and i don\u2019t have either of those things", "i just know i\u2019m happier and better when i work out", "but i don\u2019t do \u2013 i\u2019ve finally dropped the monologue about i\u2019m not a good person if i don\u2019t crush a workout", "i just try to do it every day because i know i\u2019m better mentally", "and i also cheat completely", "i have my phone", "i took a hike today", "i had my phone with me, and i stopped every ten minutes to write something down", "so, i\u2019m not really fully in", "i\u2019m not being in the moment when i\u2019m working out", "a lot of times, i\u2019m stopping hundreds of times to make notes and remind myself of stuff i have to do or put stuff on my calendar", "do you still use concept2 or a rowing machine",

that i have", "i have my whole gym in my place", "i have a trx body weight system", "i have to kettlebells, a 25 and a 35", "i have my ergometer", "i have battle ropes that are attached to my dining room table", "and i have one big power step that i just use to do pistols and stuff like that", "and i get everything done with those five things", "that is fantastic", "so, pistols, for people who don\u2019t know, those are one-legged squats", "and they can be very, very difficult depending on how you go about it", "yes", "but a bench or a step can help you because you can just do single leg stepdowns until you build up your quad and your glute strength to do pistols", "could you describe for us a recent workout or what a prototypical of yours might look like", "well, i hiked today", "that was just a 90 minute hike which was just more about feeling groovy", "but right now, i\u2019m obsessed with my ergometer", "i go through periods of not rowing and then periods of rowing really aggressively", "and this is gonna be right up your alley, tim", "i\u2019m ready", "this is like bullseye for you and your audience", "i started going to a naturopath", "so, i\u2019ve been supplementing differently", "and i started taking glutathione", "and i\u2019m rowing faster now than i did in my 20s", "i just keep getting personal bests on my rower", "it\u2019s confusing", "i\u2019m a lot older than i was when i was rowing competitively", "and i just keep knocking 30 seconds and then 45 seconds and then a minute and ten seconds off my rowing time", "so, now i\u2019m just obsessed with hitting personal bests every time i row", "okay", "let\u2019s dig into this", "so, the glutathione, how is it \u2013 for those who aren\u2019t familiar, glutathione is thought of \u2013 a simple way to think of it or the way it\u2019s often described is as a master antioxidant of sorts", "how are you having it administered", "is it being inj \u2013 god", "oh, this is so inside baseball", "sometimes i get ivs", "i get ivs if i\u2019m wrecked, if i traveled a lot or if i went to coachella", "and is that pure \u2013 is that just glutathione", "or are you doing that at the \u2013 no", "i get b vitamins", "i could do it at the end of my iv", "i\u2019ll get b vitamins and just \u2013 [crosstalk] and a glutathione push at the end or something", "yeah, exactly", "but you can get fat soluble glutathione that you just gulp down", "it takes like axle grease", "[crosstalk] yeah", "wait", "what is this company", "it\u2019s lypo-spheric", "that\u2019s the name", "lypo-spheric glutathione", "yeah", "it\u2019s the lypo-spheric glutathione", "yeah", "and i\u2019m just contributing it to the glutathione because before the glutathione, i was rowing slow", "and now i\u2019m just like a jackrabbit", "so, it could be something else", "but i\u2019m gonna say it\u2019s the glutathione", "i will warn people in advance", "i had some of this lypo-spheric glutathione at one point", "and i gave it to a friend of mine", "and i think it might have been \u2013 for those who know my buddy kevin rose, since i like to mention him, even misattribute things to him just for fun", "i think i gave him one, and he said something like, \u201cwhat is this", "horse semen?\u201d it does have a weird \u2013 it has a very weird consistency", "no, my father calls it axel grease", "he\u2019s like, \u201cgive me this axel grease,\u201d because i gave it to my dad", "i was like, \u201ci think this would really help you.\u201d and you\u2019re supposed to take it in liquid, but he\u2019s just been eating it on a spoon", "he\u2019s a better man than i", "oh, i just squeegee it out of the little packet with my \u2013 into your mouth", "yeah, into my mouth", "i take it with about two ounces of kombucha in the morning so i don\u2019t have to think about it", "yeah", "you\u2019re smarter", "i\u2019m sure you\u2019re like this", "or maybe after all of that experimentation on yourself, you just get up and have a bowl of frosted flakes in the morning, tim", "but it\u2019s like i do that", "and then i have my bowl of supplements", "and then i have my fish oil", "and then i have my curcumin", "and then i have my turmeric", "and by the end of the morning, i\u2019ve supplemented a banquet", "i don\u2019t even need to eat, i\u2019ve taken so many crappy tablets", "all right", "just to hit pause again", "so, is the exercise before breakfast", "is it the first thing you do", "what is the first \u2013 ideal morning, what\u2019s the first 60 to 90 minutes look like", "espresso shot, glutathione, work out", "what time do you wake up", "it depends on the day", "between 6:00 and 7:00", "i used to wake up a lot earlier, but i let one of my shows go, so i don\u2019t have to wake up at the crack of dawn every day anymore", "so, it\u2019s between 6:00 and 7:00", "but i have to work out in the morning or i won\u2019t work out at all", "so, you wake up", "you have espresso shot, glutathione with \u2013 i always have coffee before i work out without fail", "and then the glutathione with the kombucha", "any particular type of kombucha that\u2019s your preferred axel grease mixer", "i like better booch", "and i like \u2013 what is it", "lifeaid i think is one of the other \u2013 i love kombucha", "i\u2019m very slutty when it comes to kombucha", "i\u2019ll drink any kombucha", "i\u2019m a big kombucha fan", "all right", "so, then you buckle down to work out", "and this is gonna sound like i\u2019m just looking for opportunities to plug, which maybe i am", "but you described one of your workouts, the concept2 mid-distance 5k rows punctuated by short distance 2k hit sprints, high intensity interval training with a 10k long distance row once or twice a week", "would that be a current workout", "yeah", "that\u2019s typically my workouts", "and then i\u2019ll do a set of five by 25 kettlebells", "i\u2019ll get up in the morning and just do 125 kettleball swings in front of the television", "and then sometimes i\u2019ll do a trx workout because i didn\u2019t have really a way to simulate pullups", "so, that was why i got the trx so i could do \u2013 that was the one thing i didn\u2019t have in here was a pullup bar", "is the trx attached to a door", "is it \u2013 yeah", "it\u2019s essentially like a railing", "i have an upstairs railing, and it just hangs off of the railing", "got it", "and \u2013 and that\u2019s it", "i try to keep it relatively simple so that i\u2019ll do it", "i don\u2019t really train with anybody because i just can\u2019t \u2013 i can manage the hour workout, but i can\u2019t manage the transit between my home and a \u2013 i don\u2019t have enough time to do that too", "i\u2019ve got the hour", "i don\u2019t have two hours", "so, i don\u2019t go to a gym anymore because i just would be \u2013 i wouldn\u2019t have the time for it", "oh, yeah", "the transit time", "that \u2013 yeah", "transit time was what killed me", "it was like, \u201ci have an hour to work out", "but i don\u2019t have a half hour on either side of that to go to the gym", "do you still watch shows when you row", "totally", "totally", "yeah", "any recent favorites", "or what are you watching currently", "just fantastic junk", "some good stuff", "i watch the walking dead, fear the walking dead", "those are always really good workout shows", "right now, i\u2019m watching the magicians during my workouts", "and then when i finish that, what will i watch after that", "sometimes i watch stuff that\u2019s on streaming services because i hate to have to \u2013 when i\u2019m rowing, i don\u2019t wanna have to watch commercials", "and i can\u2019t stop to fast-forward because i\u2019m trying to beat my previous row time", "so, i\u2019ll stream stuff on hulu like x-files or handmaid\u2019s tale", "or i just watched a show called deutschland 83", "that was pretty great", "it has to be something that i can kind of watch which is why i\u2019ll typically watch something that\u2019s not too mentally demanding", "so, i can\u2019t pay attention too closely to plot points", "right", "do you make new year\u2019s resolutions", "do you have any routines or rituals around new year\u2019s", "just for people who may be listening to this at another time, we\u2019re chatting at the end of march", "like, did i make any this year", "right", "i make the same one every year which is to rest more", "it\u2019s the same resolution every year", "rest", "rest", "rest", "so, how are you gonna do that this time", "i don\u2019t know", "i should just give up", "i should stop making resolutions", "and then i won\u2019t have to not have not accomplished them", "look, maybe a part of success or success at being you, figuring out being you is understanding what your strengths and your weaknesses are", "my strength is my aggressive work ethic", "when i was a young comic, i would be like, \u201coh, i should be writing every day", "i should write", "i should be like this guy.\u201d well, that\u2019s just not how i operate", "so, i think once you accept what your own methodology of what it is \u2013 this is why you watched the terminator 30 times", "you\u2019re like, \u201cthis is my people.\u201d right", "yes", "so, i definitely have ocd", "i\u2019m definitely an obsessive personality", "but once you accept, \u201cthese are my strengths", "this is where i excel", "this is how i excel \u2013\u201d rather than try to force yourself into someone else\u2019s workflow, figure out what yours is", "as a writer \u2013 and you\u2019ve written lots of books", "i\u2019ve only written two", "but with both books, i had this huge lead time", "and it wasn\u2019t that i was lazy or procrastinating", "the book wasn\u2019t there yet", "and then just one day, the book was there", "and then i sat down, and i wrote the entire book in a few weeks", "but it just needed to gel", "it needed to synthesize", "and if i had been trying to sit down and write a little bit every day, it would have just been this big agglomeration of glob", "but just one day, i was like, \u201coh, the book is in me now", "the book is in me.\u201d and then i got it out", "oh, god", "i wish i had that experience", "man, i\u2019m so jelly", "oh, but everybody\u2019s different", "do you know what i mean", "for a long time, i would have wanted to be more like you, disciplined and sitting down because there\u2019s a panic that ensues when you are seven weeks from your deadline and you had nine months to write a book, and now you gotta write the whole thing", "but for me, certain threads have to connect", "and that requires rumination and time", "and i just can\u2019t do it any other way", "so, i don\u2019t", "i think my strength is every day trying to eat a wheelbarrow full of glass and shit out diamonds or something like that", "oh, man", "that\u2019s a good one", "that should be a tattoo", "well, speaking of eating glass, so i wanted \u2013 this might be predictable, but i\u2019m okay with predictable", "i would like to start to wrap up with a handful of questions", "and the first one i\u2019m gonna ask is \u2013 and you actually give people a heads up on this with the self-inflicted wounds", "so, you usually say, \u201cat some point, i am going to ask you about x.\u201d but i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had time to think about this", "so, do you have any favorite stories of self-inflicted wounds of your own that you could share", "well, obviously the book is just a collection, not even a comprehensive one but quite detailed of many, many mistakes that i\u2019ve made", "i\u2019m trying to think of something that\u2019s happened recently", "it\u2019s interesting", "i see my mistakes differently now than i did when i was younger", "they just feel like an aspect of being human versus some kind of tragic \u2013 flaw", "yeah, flaw", "exactly", "they just seem like an unavoidable aspect of being alive", "and i\u2019m trying to think if there\u2019s one \u2013 and then i\u2019m thinking of ones recently that don\u2019t feel that cataclysmic so they\u2019re lame stories", "oh, you could pick a classic also, like the greatest hits", "like, if you\u2019re watching tv 15 years ago, and it\u2019s like, \u201chits from the \u201880s", "da-da-da.\u201d we could take one of those as well", "just off of that", "oh, god", "just thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking", "it\u2019s interesting", "i was talking about that short film that i made that was the one that will never be seen by any human being \u2013 actually, i think it\u2019s been destroyed \u2013 where it was just like i just thought that i could just charm my way through this short", "and i had a bunch of friends show up", "and it was such an odd idea", "it didn\u2019t even make any sense", "it was about a guy who flashed women", "he flashed women, and i can\u2019t remember why he flashed women", "but it was something to do with bravery", "it was a metaphor for bravery that this guy would flash women", "and also maybe hubris, like the idea that people were gonna be super excited to see this guy\u2019s penis", "and he would try to use it as currency, and it would never go his way", "but it just made no sense", "it just ended up being a series of vignettes about a guy revealing his penis to strangers", "and i just remember at the end literally thinking, \u201cit\u2019s one thing to think people don\u2019t get me.\u201d i was like, \u201ci don\u2019t get myself", "i don\u2019t [inaudible]\u00a0trying to accomplish here.\u201d and it just never, ever coalesced", "but it was fine because it was like \u2013 i remember enjoying the process of making it and then being really surprised and delighted by what a piece of shit it was much like that set where nobody laughed", "i thought, \u201cwell, man", "that didn\u2019t work at all", "okay", "i need to go back and figure out what to do next.\u201d and i think every artist \u2013 i think quentin tarantino has a famous story about his first film being unwatchable", "i just think sometimes, if your personality is to be really aggressive and dive in, you\u2019re bound to make some spectacular failures", "and you just have to have a high tolerance for that and not take it personally and keep moving forward", "but yeah", "i literally was like, \u201ci know you guys don\u2019t get it", "i don\u2019t get it", "i can\u2019t explain it to you", "i have no idea what i was thinking", "thank you for putting yourselves in my hands", "it was a terrible mistake on your part", "but you\u2019re very gracious to have trusted me with your lives.\u201d what\u2019s the name of the short", "it was called the whipper", "conjures all sorts of images", "it makes no sense whatsoever", "when have you been extremely proud of yourself", "could be any point in your life", "can you think of a standout point where you\u2019re like, \u201cgoddamn", "good for me", "fucking a\u201d", "i hate to have it be about this because it sounds like it\u2019s super self-promotional", "but i really am proud of this film for a variety of reasons i think because it was \u2013 axis", "yeah, axis because it was such a \u2013 i was lucky that i was brought a great script", "and i had a really talented actor", "but we put this movie together so quickly", "and i had a vision for it but i also was, because we were moving so fast, feeling my way through the dark in some aspect", "and i think one of the reasons why it came together the way that it did was because i both had a vision for the film but i was open to modulating", "and i think that\u2019s really important in anything that you\u2019re doing no matter what field you\u2019re in is that you have to both \u2013 we prize vision and rigidity in this culture", "but i think that being able to pivot and be nimble is way more important than being a rigid visionary", "you have to be able to look at data and interpret it and then apply it to your situation, or you\u2019re just gonna keep banging your head against a wall", "so, we made this movie", "we got into the very second day of filming", "we started really late", "we lost our light", "we had to pivot that day", "ended up having to throw all that footage away", "another day, we lost light and had to get back up at 5:00 in the morning to shoot dawn for dusk", "but we just kept pivoting", "nothing was catastrophic", "and i think that\u2019s something i got from my father", "it\u2019s like, \u201cokay", "this isn\u2019t working", "okay", "so, we\u2019re gonna do this", "okay", "that\u2019s not working", "we\u2019re gonna do this,\u201d rather than, \u201coh, my god", "this is the end of the world", "what are we gonna do?\u201d and then in post, i had very little money for post and very little time to cut the movie together", "and about four weeks in, the editor that i had cutting the movie \u2013 he was a great guy", "really talented \u2013 just wasn\u2019t connecting with the material", "wasn\u2019t able to assemble the movie", "it was an unusual movie", "it\u2019s one guy in a car", "and i had to let him go", "and then i had to learn avid, the avid system and start cutting the movie myself", "but again, i wasn\u2019t like, \u201cwhat am i gonna do", "i don\u2019t have an editor", "i\u2019m gonna die.\u201d i just said, \u201cokay", "well, the answer here is that i\u2019m gonna learn this skillset, and i\u2019m going to keep moving forward.\u201d and then i made this little film", "it was strange and atmospheric and dreamlike", "it didn\u2019t get into sundance", "and everybody always wants to get into sundance", "but then it got into eight other festivals and won two awards and got picked up for distribution", "and the result has been much better than i ever could have anticipated", "and i\u2019m really proud of it because i made it for what is typically the catering budget on a regular hollywood movie", "we made it for just no money and in no time", "and i think it also says something", "i think what i\u2019m also proud of is that the movie actually does have a strong point of view and a strong visual personality and a strong style that is my own", "when i look at it, i don\u2019t think i\u2019m trying to emulate anybody", "i feel like this is something that i made", "it\u2019s my little lumpy ashtray from shop class", "and i really love it", "good for you", "i think it\u2019s easy to \u2013 i\u2019m not saying you but for humans to look at the people who are showcased on the covers of magazines or on the front pages of popular websites and think, \u201cwow", "they figured out all the secret sauce,\u201d or, \u201cthey have the keys to the kingdom", "and they\u2019re able to show up and just hit homeruns every time they step to the plate.\u201d and when you look at the origin stories of some of these incredible creations that people are familiar with, whether it\u2019s jaws or \u2013 the company alibaba is one example", "jack ma, the founder, i think he\u2019s the richest man in china, or certainly one of the top few at this point", "and he said \u2013 i\u2019m paraphrasing but, \u201cwe had a huge advantage in the beginning", "and that was we had no experience, no money, and no plan.\u201d and it forces you to really think outside of the box", "and even if that project doesn\u2019t succeed by outside measures, the confidence that you develop in exploring areas outside of the box can then transfer to future projects", "i remember there was this fantastic documentary", "i\u2019m gonna butcher his name", "well, it\u2019s fantastic mostly for the message, not for all of the content, which i hope makes sense", "but it\u2019s called jodorowsky\u2019s dune", "and it\u2019s the story of this attempt to make a movie about dune", "and the thing is a complete, unmitigated disaster", "complete, unmitigated disaster", "but the talent that was assembled went on to just do incredible things", "and if that disaster hadn\u2019t happened, one could argue that if you had stepped on that butterfly, these other careers wouldn\u2019t have blossomed in the way that they did, and you wouldn\u2019t have the giger design of the alien that people now know as the alien of aliens and so on", "so, i just love \u2013 and no one ever learns from success", "you can do a postmortem and say, \u201coh, this stuff worked.\u201d but failure is where you have explosive growth, where you really have to reconsider all of your assumptions", "and it\u2019s so much more powerful than success is at making you eventually successful", "so, be aggressive", "yeah", "be, be aggressive", "b-e aggressive", "a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e", "oh, totally", "yeah", "so, that\u2019s my life philosophy, be aggressive", "be aggressive", "and we want you around for a long time", "so, take your cat naps at the very least", "that\u2019s my goal", "and do you have anything you would like to say or ask of the audience", "suggestions you\u2019d like to make", "anything at all that you\u2019d like to say before we wrap up", "other than watch my movie", "other than watch your movie", "exactly", "god, that\u2019s interesting", "i guess when i did my podcast, it thematically \u2013 the stuff that we talked about was always stuff that i talked about which is it doesn\u2019t matter what you wanna do", "and again, it sounds very greeting card", "but the barriers, they\u2019re imagined", "you know what i mean", "and maybe you\u2019re gonna have to start small, and maybe you\u2019re gonna have to start close to home", "but the greater regret will always be not having started", "and i\u2019m always trying to find a way to be more bold in my life and hopefully share the things that have helped me do that with other people", "so, it is exciting to be having the conversation with you because i think that\u2019s a lot of what you\u2019ve done is you\u2019ve lived these experiences so that the things that you learn could be shared with other people", "and just go out and do awesome shit", "get your hands dirty", "get them dirty", "yeah", "the rough drafts are not a clean business", "absolutely not", "well, aisha, thank you so much for taking the time", "it was a pleasure", "so much fun", "it was great to speak with you", "i know", "super fun", "and now that i know where you are, i will track you down the next time i\u2019m in your neck of the woods", "yeah", "barbecue, music, whatever it might be in austin, texas", "come visit", "and people can visit you", "is the best site aishatyler.com", "yeah", "aishatyler.com", "but who spends time on a website anymore", "just follow me on twitter, facebook, instagram", "all that stuff is just aishatyler, one word", "a-i-s-h-a-t-y-l-e-r", "absolutely", "absolutely", "and to everyone \u2013 i\u2019m sorry", "you were gonna say something", "i don\u2019t know when this is gonna post, but i post stuff about all the stuff i\u2019m doing", "the movie\u2019s out on the 10th of april on video on demand, itunes, all that stuff", "and then archer starts i think on the 24th of april", "and all the other st \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "tv, whatever", "you can find me online", "i don\u2019t know when you\u2019re gonna listen to this", "but just come say hi to me on social", "i\u2019ll be \u2013 for days and weeks and months and years and millennia to come, hopefully", "we\u2019ll see", "yeah", "cockroaches will be listening to this on their tiny cockroach computers when the rest of us are dead", "[crosstalk] that\u2019s exactly right", "cockroaches will remember us fondly", "and for you non-cockroaches \u2013 actually, if cockroaches are listening, you\u2019re welcome also to check out the show notes where i will provide links to everything that we\u2019ve talked about, including axis", "and you can find all of those at tim.blog/podcast along with the show notes for every other episode", "and aisha, thank you so much one more time for being so goddamn entertaining and inspiring at the same time", "it\u2019s a rare combo", "so, i really appreciate the time", "it\u2019s always great to talk with you", "thanks, tim", "of course", "and to everybody out there on the interwebs, be safe maybe", "more important, be aggressive", "get out there", "if you\u2019re dreaming of doing something, creating something someday, just get out a shitty first draft because guess what", "all the first drafts are really fucking awful", "it\u2019s very rare that someone just, as i was alluding to, shits out diamonds on a daily basis", "it starts with putting something out there into the world", "and hopefully, at least it makes a market of one happy", "and that is you", "so, i will close there", "and thanks to everybody for listening", "hey, guys", "this is tim again", "just a few more things before you take off", "no", "1, this is 5- bullet friday", "do you want to get a short email from me", "would you enjoy getting a short email from me every friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend", "and 5-bullet friday is a very short email where i share the coolest things i\u2019ve found or that i\u2019ve been pondering over the week", "that could include favorite new albums that i\u2019ve discovered", "it could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that i\u2019ve somehow dug up in the world of the esoteric, as i do", "it could include favorite articles that i have read and that i\u2019ve shared with my close friends, for instance", "and it\u2019s very short", "it\u2019s just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend", "so, if you want to receive that, check it out", "just go to fourhourworkweek.com, that\u2019s fourhourworkweek.com all spelled out, and just drop in your email, and you will get
