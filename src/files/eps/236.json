This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to interview world-class performers and tease out the habits, routines, tactics, etc. that you can use and apply immediately, inmediatamente, that\u2019s what we say in Espa\u00f1ol. S\u00ed, habla Espa\u00f1ol. Okay, moving on, why am I in the language vibe? Because I\u2019ve got a Japanese treat for you guys. This time, it\u2019s not military, it\u2019s not entertainment, it\u2019s not chess, it is not business per se. We have a master Japanese bladesmith. It is a very fascinating story. I have, since day one on this podcast, wanted to have the chance to have a long, in-depth conversation with a bladesmith. I love knives. I collect knives. Now we have Murray Carter on the podcast. I\u2019m not going to give you his full bio because it unfolds in the process of this conversation. But I had an absolute blast. If you want to get into knives, you want to get into Japan, you want to get into martial arts. If you have even a passing interest in someone with a high degree of \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say OCD, but attention to detail that nearly boggles the mind, someone who went from class clown to doing an 18-year stint in Japan, then this it he podcast for you. I really am so excited to provide this to you guys because it exceeded all of my expectations. Murray Carter is @cartercutlery on Facebook and Instagram. Definitely check out the Instagram. He was raised in Nova Scotia. That\u2019s in Canada, our fine neighbors to the north. He came in contact with Japanese culture when he attended a karate competition at the age of 15. I\u2019m going to save a lot of his story for the actual conversation, which leads to a chance encounter with a 16th generation bladesmith. Then 18 years in Japan. Then being declared an Alien of Extraordinary Ability. Those words are capitalized by the INS in the U.S., when he was granted immigration status to relocate. He\u2019s now in Portland, Oregon. For me, this is a really fun podcast to finally publish. It\u2019s one I have dreamt of having since the very first episode, even before recording the first episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. So without further ado, please enjoy \u2013 actually I\u2019m going to have some ado \u2013 but please enjoy this conversation with Murray Carter.

Murray Carter: Thanks for having me on, Tim. Tim Ferriss: I am very excited to connect for many reasons. No. 1, from the very outset, one of my fantasies for this podcast was at some point having on a master bladesmith. We can get into why that\u2019s the case, but I wanted that to be one of my objectives and fantasies realized in a sense. I\u2019m checking that box, No. 1. No 2 is that I felt like you were somehow brought to me, not to get too woo-woo. But just in the last few months, I\u2019ve had a close friend who\u2019s former special operations, tell me that I had to take a class of yours, at the very least, to make an Inek knife or some other type of knife, to try to learn the craft. I then also spent time last week with a well-known film director whose son has become a huge fan of yours and is studying the craft. On many levels, I think that this was, in some form, destined to be. I would love to start with just a little bit of background. I think maybe the easiest way to jump into it is to cover where you grew up and how Japan entered the picture. Murray Carter: Sure, I\u2019d be happy to share that story with you. I grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. At a very young age, I became very interested in martial arts and military history and kind of the outdoors. Watching movies like Jeremiah Johnson and so on gave me a great fascination for tools and knives and weapons and so on. When I was 15 years old, I was lucky to attend a regional karate competition as a guest, as an observer. That really piqued my interest. I actually enrolled in a karate dojo and did that for several years. That started my real fascination with Japan. Then, of course, I coupled that interest with reading books about the martial arts and ninjas and so on. Of course, samurais and samurai swords and the blades that they used. That\u2019s kind of where the fascination with Japan started. Tim Ferriss: When did that become, and how did that become, an opportunity to go to Japan? In terms of age, you were 15 or so at the time? Murray Carter: I started karate when I was 15. That would be in high school. I graduated when I was 17 and then turned 18 that summer. I worked for a full year \u2013 well, I worked for several months and then in the spring of the following year, while I was still 18, I did travel to Japan. The destination within Japan was pre-determined for me \u2013 that was the prefecture called Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu, the southernmost of the four main island in Japan \u2013 because that\u2019s where the karate dojo was located that I was going to attend to further and continue my studies in karate. Tim Ferriss: What type of karate was that? Murray Carter: It\u2019s called Chit\u014d-ry\u016b, it\u2019s spelled C-H-I-T-O, hyphen, R-Y-U. It\u2019s a version of Shit\u014d-ry\u016b, which is a little bit more well known. I guess it originates from Okinawa. One of the main features of Chit\u014d-ry\u016b was a higher, more mobile stance than a lot of the other traditional forms of karate like Sh\u014dt\u014dkan or Goj\u016b-ry\u016b, which have very low, very low center of gravity stances for solidity, but lacking maybe a little bit in mobility and flexibility. Tim Ferriss: When I first came across a few of the snippets of your bio, I thought to myself, okay, this is really a conversation that has to happen because one of the most life-changing events in my life was in 1992, I was in high school 15, and I had the opportunity to switch out of Spanish class because I\u2019d concluded I was bad at Spanish, into a different language. My friends were in Japanese class. I was always fascinated by martial arts, ninjas and so on. I went to Japanese class and six months later, had the opportunity to leave the U.S. on my first extended trip overseas to a sister school, which was in Tokyo. At 15, went to Tokyo and stayed there for a year in a Japanese school and with a Japanese family. This is not really a digression, because I feel like I want to share this with you, so there\u2019s a little bit of common ground. I remember the first time I went to a karate school in Japan to take a class. I went to a Seid\u014d-kai school. That was my first introduction to leg kicks. Mainly on the receiving end. I remember \u2013 Murray Carter: You were the punching bag. Tim Ferriss: I was the punching bag. I remember that I came in and they\u2019re like, oh, this former \u2013 or at the time, current wrestler, foreigner. I was the only one in the school. They\u2019re like okay, let\u2019s see how you move around. No head contact. So I\u2019m punching this guy in the chest and every time I punched him in the chest, he would kick me in the leg. I said, that\u2019s a great trade. I\u2019m just going to punch you in the chest all day and you can kick me in the leg as many times as you want. I couldn\u2019t go to school the next day. Murray Carter: Because your leg was all swollen. Tim Ferriss: Because my leg was ruined. How did you then go from \u2013 I guess two questions. No. 1 is, how did the opportunity come about for you to travel to Japan to further your studies? And then secondly, where did blades come into play? Murray Carter: When I was in high school, I really caught a travel bug that kind of fed into my fierce, independent spirit. Although it wasn\u2019t really popular at the time, I started hitchhiking when I was 14 years old and I found the wondrous joys of being able to hike out to a highway and stick my thumb out and get to places I wanted to get to without having to save up money to buy my own car or pay for the insurance or the gasoline. It was a wonderful experience. I traveled all over the province of Nova Scotia doing that. The more I did it, the more obsessed and compelled I felt to do that. By the time I was 16 years old, I actually traveled to Europe by myself over the school Christmas vacation. I spent three weeks in Europe visiting some acquaintances and also venturing to places I had never been by myself before. After high school, I was very keen to travel. Although I had this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that studies were awaiting and that there was an expectation, both self-incurred and through my family, to attend higher education, I couldn\u2019t ignore the overwhelming desire to travel. After high school, I started to put this trip together that really was supposed to be an around-the-world tour. When I was still in high school, one of the seniors who had graduated two years before me had done an around-the-world tour. At the time, I believe you could, through some different airlines, you could purchase a very special plane ticket where so long as you kept moving in the same direction around the globe, for one set fare, it was something like $6,000 at the time. You could continue to keep flying to different destinations as long as you kept moving in one direction so that eventually you would end up in the same place that you started from and then your ticket would expire. It was an around-the-world airfare, basically. When this senior came back from his world trip, his story was featured in the local newspaper. I read it in its entirety and became very inspired. I thought, wow, that\u2019s exactly what I want to do is emulate this around-the-world tour. I concocted a plan that would have me hitchhike across North America and then from the West Coast, depart to Japan and stay there for six months, where I would continue and further my education in karate and hopefully have some sort of cultural experience while I was there. But I didn\u2019t know what that was going to look like. From there, I was going to travel around the rest of Southeast Asia. I had planned to take a cargo ship, I think, from there to India and then another cargo ship from India to Africa and travel through Africa and up through Europe and back to Nova Scotia, my hometown. That was the plan. I had budgeted time for it. I had budgeted money for it. I was in the process of actively trying to establish connections and links and leads so that I would know people at some of these destinations I was hoping to get to. I probably had 30 or 40 percent of it figured out and the rest I was just going to wing as I went along. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good ratio. I think that\u2019s actually a very good ratio. Murray Carter: Well, just like your friends in certain communities, the high-speed, low-drag. There\u2019s a beauty to not being chained down with too many plans or promises. Tim Ferriss: As a friend of mine, Rolf Potts, who wrote a book that had a huge impact on me, called Vagabonding, who is a long-time, long-term traveler. Ultimately, the ability to improvise is more valuable than a lot of the planning you do on the front end, which you put differently. So you get to Japan. You have this 40 percent figured out, what happens? Murray Carter: As fate would have it, I immediately enrolled in the karate dojo, what they call a Hombu dojo, which is like the headquarters of our style of chit\u014d-ry\u016b karate. I just want to say, I want to put a plug in there that they were very kind to me and it was a great experience. I can\u2019t say enough kind things about the people that I met there addition the sensei who was there. I digress. I was very keen and every morning started at 6:00, where we would meet and go into a special tatami mat room, light incense, and give homage to the ancestors of the karate sensei\u2019s family, who started the whole thing, who had passed on. Then we would go to each corner of the room, each one of the participants, and sit in zazen. Basically, you sit on your knees with your feet tucked up underneath your buttocks, for 30 minutes. It was absolutely excruciating. Your feet would fall asleep and you were wondering why in the world you traveled across the globe to find yourself sitting in this excruciating position for 30 minutes every morning. After that, 6:30, the bell would ring, much to our relief. Then we would go off and we would meet in the karate dojo at 6:45. We had practices every morning like that and then we had practices three times \u2013 I think it was Monday, Wednesday, Friday, in the evenings. I was just in karate heaven. I was practicing with some guys who would progress on to be world champions. I really was amongst some great skill and talent and dedicated folks. But what happened, the connection to knives was this. Roughly around the fourth week of practicing, karate, it was one of those evening practices. We were doing, let\u2019s see if I can recall what it\u2019s called, a jumping, flying side kick. You would run up as if you were going to do the triple jump, and launch yourself into the air and do a side kick at some imaginary target. No one ever taught you that if you actually made contact in that position what you would do next. Mostly it was just flying through the air. I think we were very ill-prepared for actually kicking anything in that manner. You certainly wouldn\u2019t want to go running up and jump at a wall and try to kick it because I don\u2019t think the outcome would be very favorable. Anyway, when I was coming down to land from that position, I didn\u2019t quite have my feet and knees in front of me. I very much had one of my legs \u2013 I think it was my left leg. I was kicking with my right leg and my left leg, when I came down and landed, I dislocated my knee. Fortunately, it was kind of a mild dislocation. But it was a dislocation nonetheless. I had to go to the hospital and get a much of liquid removed from somewhere in the knee joint. The doctor there put a cast on my leg that basically went from my left ankle all the way up to the top of my thigh on my left leg. He said I had to keep it on for three weeks. That\u2019s the curse of being an 18-year-old; you think you\u2019re invincible. So of course, I convinced him to take it off after one week and I never ever fully recovered. In fact, it turns out I\u2019ve got a completely torn ACL and I\u2019ve been living with it and managing just fine for all these years ever since. Almost 30 years later; I\u2019m 47 now. Now I\u2019m immobile and I\u2019m the karate dojo in the barracks, we\u2019ll call it. Not really able to practice. The karate teacher comes in, Chit\u014dse-sensei was his name; a great man. He threw a Japanese language textbook at me. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was an aggressive throw or a kind toss, but either way, it really was an amazing gift. Up to that point, I had acquired no Japanese language ability. Here was a textbook that was a very well-written textbook. I started to read it and work through the problems and started to study the language. That changed everything. Tim Ferriss: What was the consequence of adding some Japanese speaking ability to your skillset at that point? Murray Carter: Well, I think you\u2019re aware because I could tell from the way you\u2019ve spoken some Japanese words that you\u2019ve acquired quite a level of proficiency in the language. It opened up a whole lot more doors to me. Of course it opened up conversation. It opened up friendships. It opened up the possibilities of travel, pursuing hobbies outside of karate. I thought that I had a very open mind when I went to Japan, but in hindsight, really I was just bonkers for karate and I really wasn\u2019t seeing much outside of that world. But once I started to learn the language and made some friends who were outside of the karate circle, that\u2019s when everything really opened up for me and a lot of doors opened. That\u2019s what opened up the possibility to start studying bladesmithing. Tim Ferriss: I had a very similar experience. Different domain, but not too dissimilar. I went to a school in Tokyo called Seikei Gakuen, which is in Kichijoji. For those people eager to visit Tokyo, the Inokashira Park is right next to or very close to where this school is located. As a student, I had to wear the uniform which looks sort of like a Chinese, mandarin-collared, odd-looking seifuku, as they call it. Murray Carter: I\u2019m glad they had your size. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they needed to do some special work to get a first-year high school student to fit this jacket. I was actually very fond of having a uniform. It simplified things dramatically. I had this uniform and as part of the school, it was very much Where\u2019s Waldo in the sense that I could easily be spotted as the only American in this school of 5,000 Japanese. Everyone had to do bukasa. Bukasa is \u2013 Murray Carter: After-school activities. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. You have to choose a club. It is mandatory or it was, at least, at Seikei. The clubs that were eager or interested in potentially having me were rugby. Because they\u2019re like all right, you\u2019re bigger than most first years, so that\u2019ll be an asset. Kendo, which I was interested in already and that\u2019s where I thought I was headed. And then judo approached me. I thought judo at the time was very much like Aikido where some guy comes at with this very exaggerated faux knife thrust and then you whip him around and Steven Segal him to the ground. I was like, well, that\u2019s not terribly interesting to me because from all the wrestling and so on that I\u2019ve done, I\u2019m more interested in a resisting opponent. The judo guys taught me or showed me very quickly that judo is very much full contact and really similar to wrestling. At the time, I couldn\u2019t read a single Kanji \u2013 for people listening, Chinese characters adopted by the Japanese. I had a basic grasp of the syllabaries of Japanese, so the Hirajana and Kanatana, but otherwise, was really at a \u201cWhere is the bathroom? Thank you. Good morning\u201d level of Japanese. It wasn\u2019t until I had the motivation to get better at judo and realized that the best textbooks were all in Japanese, at the time at least, and then had friends support me by pointing me to comic books that I could use to learn dialogue, that all the doors opened up, as you said. I just want to speak in defense of Japanese people for a second here, which is to say that a lot of non-Japanese who visit Japan and they\u2019re like, \u201cAh, the inscrutable Japanese. They\u2019re so xenophobic and they\u2019re so hard to connect with.\u201d I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually a fair assessment in most cases. The Japanese \u2013 this is a bit of a rant, so bear with me \u2013 but when the Gods of the Universe were handing out phoniums and sounds, the Japanese got a pretty short hand. They didn\u2019t get a lot of sounds, so Japanese are very insecure about their ability in other languages and have trouble, as most people know, distinguishing between L and R and so on. As a result, they have a very rote-driven approach to memorizing vocab, but they shy away from speaking or trying to speak English. I think that is, at least in my experience, the main barrier. As soon as you speak, even if you can hold a two-minute conversation or you have a dozen phrases memorized, they will literally clap their hands. You\u2019ve seen this. They\u2019ll go, [speaking Japanese]. Murray Carter: [Speaking Japanese]. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, exactly. The response that you get is so exaggerated, but wonderful. In Japan that as soon as you make the effort, all of the doors open. I\u2019m going to shut up now. But I hate to hear the Japanese described as so arms-distance and so on, from people who have not taken the time to learn even ten words in Japanese. So I get very excited and I feel like there\u2019s someone who\u2019s had a similar experience. How did the blades then come into the picture? Murray Carter: Just before I get into that, I wanted to comment on your experience in Japan. It\u2019s cool that we were in Japan at the same time, since I\u2019ve been there since 1988. So in \u201992, I was up to my eyeballs in bladesmithing and all sorts of other things. I just wanted to say that your astute observations about the Japanese culture and the way you picked up the language and the unique experience that you had, it\u2019s commendable really. Because I think you understand that all the 10,000 other people who\u2019ve had a similar experience to you, your understanding and appreciation and comprehension of what you actually underwent and the Japanese heart and the Japanese psyche, the [speaking Japanese], it\u2019s really commendable, your level of appreciation for what you underwent. Tim Ferriss: I appreciate that. It was a complete life-changer for me. It fundamentally changed my entire trajectory. I\u2019m still in touch with my host family. I had dinner with them about a month ago in Japanese, 25 years later. Murray Carter: Oh, wow, that\u2019s wonderful. I don\u2019t know if you know, the day after tomorrow, I\u2019m actually going to Japan. Tim Ferriss: I did not know that. Murray Carter: Yeah, I\u2019m going over for nine days. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s exciting. Murray Carter: I\u2019ve got an appointment to buy a new power hammer and I\u2019m going to visit with some steel manufacturers and then do the regular rounds of Osaka, Sakai, Kyoto, Fukui Prefecture, up to see my teacher, Mr. Yasuyuki Sakemoto in Nagano, and then back down to Tokyo. That\u2019s just around the corner for me. Tim Ferriss: So jealous. Murray Carter: This is a nice warm-up. Tim Ferriss: So you mentioned your teacher, your master. Your knee is taken out. You have a book kindly or aggressively tossed at you \u2013 not sure \u2013 but nonetheless, is the tinder for getting you to dip your toe in Japanese communication. Murray Carter: Sure. Well, I like the tinder example because it certainly ignited quite a passion in me. It certainly ignited that fuel. What happened was I think within the first day I was at the karate dojo, one of the fellow students there, [inaudible] I think his name was. He had a little scooter, of course the ubiquitous scooter all over the Japan, the little 50CC scooters. He was kind enough, since I had an international driver\u2019s license and was licensed to drive it, even though I didn\u2019t have much experience on two wheels, he let me borrow that scooter for a day in between karate in the morning and the evening karate class. I just bravely \u2013 it\u2019s kind of crazy because I have no sense of direction and it was prior to the days of GPS, but I just intrepidly took that scooter and started driving around. I was probably into the third or fourth hour of my adventure, wondering if I was ever going to make it back to the karate dojo, that I drove past a very intriguing and interesting building. I only caught it out of the corner of my eye because I was probably driving too fast. It inspired me to put on the brakes and think, what did I just see? I checked both ways and did a u-turn. I drove back to this building and it was kind of like a [speaking Japanese], a gate, an archway where there was a driveway entrance into an inner courtyard. Beside the gate was a display window with this huge, it\u2019s what they call a Kujira b\u014dch\u014d, a huge whale meat filleting knife. It was a display piece because of it\u2019s monstrous size. It was pretty clear to me that there must be some knives beyond this gate. I curiously went inside the courtyard and parked the little scooter. Then there were these glass doors into a building and I peered through the glass doors and I could see more knives on display shelves. I think I probably knocked. It was one of the squeaky doors on the rollers? Tim Ferriss: Oh, sure. Murray Carter: Yeah, of course they\u2019re all squeaky because [inaudible]. They say that the squeaky hinge gets the grease, but that\u2019s not true in Japan. They just leave it squeaky. I ventured in and I just became mesmerized by all these wonderful blades. In three directions, there were just knives everywhere and two or three shelves all the way up to the ceiling. There were sushi knives and deba b\u014dch\u014ds for breaking apart the fish. There were thin filleting knives and vegetable knives, paring knives, and then there were all sorts of agricultural tools. There were comma sickles and there were axes and different hatchets and different types of hoes for digging up the Jamaimo and all sorts of fascinating things; tools I\u2019d never even seen before and couldn\u2019t identify. I was there looking at all these blades and I don\u2019t even know how much time passed by. I\u2019m guessing it was probably only a few minutes, but it could\u2019ve been hours. I was so lost in thought and trying to absorb everything I was experiencing. A man came in from the other side of the building. He looked at me and saw I was a Gaijin and he said, \u201cHello.\u201d I guess we talked for a few minutes and I tried to communicate. Because at this point, I hadn\u2019t had the textbook tossed to me yet. This came before then. This was before I injured my knee. It was literally the second day I was in Kumamoto. We talked for a few minutes and his wife brought out a couple of glasses of cold Mugicha. Tim Ferriss: Oh, it\u2019s my favorite thing in the world. Murray Carter: Oh, you like Mugicha? I\u2019m not too fond of Mugicha. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m a huge fan, yeah. This was in the summer? Murray Carter: Buckwheat tea, because it was summer, so they serve it cold. This was literally in June, the late part of June; so it was very hot. After a few minutes of dialogue, because he could speak a word or two of English, I think I asked, \u201cHey, can I come back some time?\u201d I think he said, [speaking Japanese]. He said \u201cCome back whenever you want.\u201d That was one of my first impressions of Japan. Then I didn\u2019t visit him for many weeks. Then when the textbook was tossed to me, I think something must have clicked because I thought, that\u2019s the kind of person that if I could have deeper conversation with, I think it could be really rewarding. That was one of the, as I said before, it was the tinder that fueled this desire and passion to be a communicator. Of course, the irony is having grown up in Nova Scotia, Canada in the \u201870s, we were all spoon-fed the French language as Canada\u2019s second language, basically from Grade 1. I had developed quite a \u2013 what can I say \u2013 a complex about the French language because I never really learned much because I was the class clown and I was always standing out in the hallway while all the other kids were in the class actually learning something. I managed to get myself kicked out of so many French classes that I really didn\u2019t pick too much up. When I was headed to Japan and people said, Murray, you should really try to learn Japanese when you\u2019re over there because when you come back, you could get any job you want. Of course, that was in an era where everyone thought Japan Inc. was going to take over the world. Japan was the focus of all the movies. Of course, Die Hard \u2013 the Nakatomi building and the decadence and opulence of these rich, Japanese corporations where they had lifelong employment. It was really quite an enigma and the world was fascinated by Japan. Everyone thought that Japanese was going to be the \u2013 it was when everyone had a Sony Walkman, right? They thought that Japanese was going to be the trade language in the world. People said, you\u2019re going to Japan? Learn the Japanese language and you\u2019ll be set for life. I would agree with them, but it went in one ear and out the other because I\u2019m mumbling to myself under my breath like, yeah, right, I can\u2019t even speak a word of French and I\u2019ve been exposed to it for 12 years. You expect me to learn Japanese? That\u2019s such a foreign language with a different alphabet. Come on, get serious. I really didn\u2019t have any expectations of learning the language and that turned out to be the blessing in disguise, insomuch that I thought well, if I could just learn one word today, just one word, just how to say thank you or to say actually, no thank you. I remember when someone tried to feed me raw fish liver and I couldn\u2019t say no thank you, so I had to eat it. I thought, I\u2019m going home tonight, I\u2019m going to open up that textbook and find out where it says how to politely refuse raw fish liver. It was from a Fugu, nonetheless. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God, yeah. Blowfish. You\u2019ve got to be careful with the blowfish. Murray Carter: Because I didn\u2019t have any preconceived notion of what I should or shouldn\u2019t be able to achieve in the language, I just literally took it one word at a time and took great delight and great pleasure in the new word that I would learn each day. Tim Ferriss: Now flash forward, you have this textbook. When did you go back to visit the knife shop again? Or what happened when you went back? Murray Carter: It\u2019s a great question. Of course, I ended up spending a lot of time there, so that\u2019s a question I should be able to answer. I\u2019m just going to make it up because I can\u2019t remember exactly. I stayed in Japan that first stint for nine months. First it was with karate and then I met the Japanese bladesmith. Then I delved into a whole bunch of different things. Then I went back to North America and enrolled at advanced reading and writing Japanese at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. I took four years of study in 12 academic mods. Then I went back to Japan. That\u2019s when I immediately went to Mr. Sakemoto and said, \u201cI\u2019m back. I speak the language now and I really want to learn about bladesmithing.\u201d I may or may not have met him a couple of other times during that first nine-month stint, but honestly, I don\u2019t remember. Tim Ferriss: I want to hit pause to dig into one thing that you just said because it\u2019s fascinating. Did you just say you took four years of academic course load in 12 months? Murray Carter: Yes, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So former class clown \u2013 is that a super human feat? Did you just go to class all day every day? How did you go about \u2013 what were the keys to getting that done? Murray Carter: When I went for an interview with the Dean of the Japanese studies program, Mr. Hiro Soga at the time, who had actually written most of the textbooks in the day, I immediately took my interview with him in broken Japanese. I said, \u201cPlease, please, please, let me take the 200-level classes, both the reading and writing and the conversation.\u201d As I was trying to have a conversation with him, he was correcting every second word I said. He kept telling me, \u201cGrammar is everything.\u201d I said, \u201cCome on. You understand what I\u2019m saying.\u201d He says, \u201cYes, but there\u2019s a big difference between \u2018I want to eat\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ve eaten.\u2019 Tense is everything.\u201d He was very gracious and he said, \u201cListen, if you study through the first year or 100-level textbooks in the next month and bring me evidence that you\u2019ve done all the exercises and passed some verbal examinations, then I\u2019ll also let you enroll immediately in the second-year classes.\u201d So I immediately enrolled in 200-level classes while on the side I was also completing all the course material for the 100-level, or first-year, classes. If I enrolled in September, by the time the end of October came along in two months, I had finished all of those 100-level class workbooks and passed his expectations and I was getting A\u2019s in my 200-level classes. I took the reading and writing and then the conversation class from September until probably April, when the University academic year ends. Then I enrolled in the spring six weeks intensive 300-level classes. Then when they finished, I took the six-week, intensive 400-level classes, which was reading Japanese newspapers and conducting business in Japanese and honorifics and so on. That\u2019s how I managed to do all four year study in 12 calendar months. Tim Ferriss: So this was before you really took a deep dive with the bladesmithing? Murray Carter: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So what was driving that motivation to do so much and to really get after it? Was it the \u201cHey, Japan\u2019s going to take over the world?\u201d Was that an element of it? Was it an inexplicable having caught some type of idea virus that you just couldn\u2019t kick related to Japan? Did you know how you were going to use it? I know I\u2019m throwing out a lot here. But what was driving that studiousness? Because that isn\u2019t how it sounds like your academic career started. What was driving that? Murray Carter: I want to be cute and say that Japan had taken over my world. I wasn\u2019t so concerned about it taking over anybody else\u2019s. When I went to Japan, something very magical happened. You know the advice or the adage for youngsters for decades or even centuries has been go it on your own and find your own fame and fortune. While I certainly hadn\u2019t found fame nor fortune, what I did find in Japan was a part of me that I never knew existed. As I mentioned before, I had grown up with a tremendous complex when it came to languages. I had never really excelled at sports. I felt in many ways that I probably hadn\u2019t lived up to my own father\u2019s expectations as the only boy, because I wasn\u2019t doing baseball or soccer or any of the things that all the other boys were interested in. I spent most of my childhood inside watching TV and playing with Lego and just wanting to do things with my hands. I went to Japan and then found out I had this latent skill for languages and I made all sorts of new friends. Nobody was judging me based on what I had accomplished thus far in my life. It was all new, fresh relationships. I really was, in many ways, able to reinvent myself. It wasn\u2019t so much that I was reinventing myself as I was discovering parts of myself that I never knew existed. I think that for any young person, whether it\u2019s a musical instrument or a language, or a sport, or really anything that they dedicate themselves to and gain a certain proficiency in, that kind of skill can give a young person so much confidence and open up so many other doors for them, and really be one of the greatest stepping stones from which to launch the rest of your life; to step out into life on. As I was learning the Japanese language and getting tremendously positive feedback, as you mentioned, from Japanese people. This was in the \u201880s, before foreigners had really penetrated every corner of Japan. I was down in Kyushu and I remember if I saw a foreigner on the street, I\u2019d go [speaking Japanese] because I never saw them there. Now, you see foreigners everywhere. But back in those late \u201880s, it wasn\u2019t so common. I got tremendously positive feedback from the people around me. I started new friendships and they encouraged me in my language study. I think for the first time in my life, I remember having feelings like wow, I\u2019ve got some skills. I could really be somebody. This is great. I really want to see how far I can take this. It gave me drive and passion and dedication that I never knew I possessed before. In fact, I thought I was kind of a quitter growing up because that\u2019s what all the adult influences around me said. I was a quitter and that I\u2019d amount to nothing. I was quite delighted to find out that might not be true. Tim Ferriss: What a great story. I had the \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say the exact same \u2013 but a very parallel experience. I really shudder to think what my life would be like had I not had that year abroad, which is very uncommon, or I should say less common in the U.S. than many other places where a gap year is encouraged. I don\u2019t have kids, but I\u2019ve thought about if I would have any non-negotiables that I would insist on if I had kids, the only two that I\u2019ve really been able to come up with in terms of experiences are sports of some type and could be something that is thought of as unathletic, but let\u2019s just call it sports. Then a gap year or a year of traveling in a foreign environment. Because of everything that you just said. I think it\u2019s just such an incredible opportunity to find yourself and to find your own confidence. You mentioned honorifics. For people who don\u2019t know what that is, there are many different levels or many different ways to speak or write or communicate with a Japanese person depending on how old they are, depending on where they rank relative to you. Even in say a school environment, you would have sempai, like the upper classmen above you, and then the kohai below you and so on. It determines what type of grammar, in some cases, you use. I was going to ask you, I\u2019d love to hear when you then came back to Yoshimoto-san, some people have heard san before \u2013 S-A-N. Then above that, you would have, -sama, right? And then below that, let\u2019s say you\u2019re talking to a friend or a younger kid, you might say -kun or you could even use -chan, which is kind of similar to that. What is the proper suffix for a master bladesmith? Would you formally refer \u2013 is there a master suffix that you would use for Mr. Yoshimoto or is it simply Yoshimoto-san? Murray Carter: Well, most commonly, we just use the word \u201csensei.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Sensei. Okay, Yoshimoto-sensei. Murray Carter: That\u2019s right. So schoolteacher or politician or professor at university or master in the forge is \u201csensei.\u201d Tim Ferriss: For people who are language nerds, just because I don\u2019t get a chance to explore this very much on many of my podcasts, so sensei is a really interesting word to look at or suffix to look at literally because you have sen, which is before, and then sei, which is born, in effect. But in Chinese, it\u2019s totally different. It means Mister. You would say like [speaking Japanese], is Mister so you don\u2019t use it for a woman. In the same way oddly enough like tegami, which is kind of hand paper, means letter in Japanese, but in Chinese or in Mandarin, shojur is toilet paper. There are a lot of things that are the same in both and a lot of things that are very different. How did Mr. Yoshimoto-sensei, how did he re-enter the picture for you? Murray Carter: First of all, I want to clarify one thing. That I am 17th generation Yoshimoto bladesmith, but my teacher\u2019s name is Sakemoto. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. All right. Murray Carter: Just for your listeners\u2019 pleasure, if they\u2019re interested in the content of this podcast, they can go to YouTube and see the history of the Yoshimoto bladesmiths. On Carter Cutlery\u2019s channel. So can see how Yoshimoto became Sakemoto because that, in itself, is a very interesting story. But my teacher\u2019s name is Sakemoto-sensei. Tim Ferriss: I got it, okay. So Sakemoto-sensei within the umbrella, or later then becoming or how that became Yoshimoto. We might delve into that. So Sakemoto-sensei. Murray Carter: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Could you tell us more about when it clicked? What happened? How did you \u2013 because ultimately I don\u2019t want to give away the punchline. You\u2019re talking about, I want to say, let\u2019s see if I can get this part right, 18 years in Japan? Murray Carter: Yes, I was there 18 years. I apprenticed with Mr. Sakemoto for six years. Then basically I was asked by him to take over the family business. He had two daughters and no sons and no hopeful apprentices apart from myself. I guess I had demonstrated a certain attitude and aptitude for the family trade that he asked me to assume the position of 17th generation Yoshimoto bladesmith. He was, he is, because he\u2019s in Nagano. I\u2019m going to see him next week. He is a very extraordinary human being. He is very untraditional in the way we had a relationship of apprentice and sensei. He was not strict, as you would imagine. People think of The Karate Kid, wax on/wax off and standing there for hours on end. Doing menial tasks that the apprentice thinks must be meaningless and he\u2019s just being tested. He\u2019s just having to sweep the floor to do the grunt labor for the teacher and starting to feel unappreciated and abused and so on. That was not my story. Mr. Sakemoto was very gracious. He would share with me all of his skills up front. Of course, I could only comprehend so many, so I would go and practice things he showed me and then he would show me more things. But once we got to a certain point where he felt he had shared all of the essential bladesmithing and sharpening techniques with me that he regularly practiced, he did something out of the ordinary. He said, \u201cMurray, if you really want to learn about forge welding, I\u2019m going to arrange for you to go down to Kawashiri and spend some time down there because that\u2019s their area of expertise. So I would go down to Kawashiri and, in fact, I went off and on down to Kawashiri for a couple of years and mastered the technique of forge welding. I would always come back to Sakemoto\u2019s forge and use it as my home base. I would always apply and put into practice what I\u2019d learned there and elsewhere at the home forge. Then he would say, \u201cYou know, you really need to learn about the traditional Japanese fishmongers\u2019 knives, nakataha, the deba b\u014dch\u014d, and the sashimi knife and all those two-layer, special, chisel-ground blades. You should go to Osaka, a little, special place called Sakai, where they specialize in that skill.\u201d So off I went to Sakai for several weeks. I would be hooked up again, with some very gracious bladesmiths there. I would learn their trade and I\u2019d come back to Kumamoto to Sakemoto\u2019s shop and then light the fire and try to emulate or put into practice the things I\u2019d learned. I\u2019d show them to him and he\u2019d say, \u201cOkay, now you\u2019re getting somewhere. Now you need to learn a little bit about marketing and the overall financial aspect of running a business making knives. You need to go to Seki City, Japan, because those guys are really savvy businessmen when it comes to the cutlery industry up there.\u201d So off I would go to Seki City, Japan and learn what I could up there. And again, always come back to Mr. Sakemoto and then ply what I had learned. He taught me many important things, but he also coached me. He was a very gracious coach and never cool or strict or punitive, even when he probably should have been. A very kind and the most tolerant and understanding and patient sensei you could ever have asked for. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s such an amazing opportunity, just incredible. For people who are listening, and I\u2019ll be honest, I would say I\u2019m in this group as well, who don\u2019t know the steps involved with Japanese bladesmithing, who don\u2019t even know what forge welding is, which I would certainly raise my hand as it relates to that. Could you describe what makes Japanese bladesmithing? There\u2019s certainly a prized quality that goes along with Japanese knives. I wrote a book relating to cooking and learning some time ago, called The 4-Hour Chef. I spent a lot of time with high-end chefs around the United States, in San Francisco, New York City, and so on. Almost every single one has at least one Japanese knife that they treat like a Lamborghini. It\u2019s only taken out for special occasions. It\u2019s meticulously cared for. Could you describe the steps in making a knife in the Japanese style and what is unique about it? Murray Carter: Sure. There\u2019s so much to say on that topic. I\u2019ll just try to keep it concise and interesting for your listeners. First of all, there\u2019s a fundamental, philosophical difference between what I\u2019m just going to loosely term \u201cWestern cutlery\u201d and \u201cJapanese cutlery.\u201d Everybody knows from movies like Kill Bill and so on, just how revered the Samurai sword can be. People even know that often they were christened with their own names and considered by their owners to have legendary qualities. Some of the big, philosophical differences are that Western culture puts a high value on something being durable and strong and tough and robust. As a result, as that extends to cutlery, we end up with a lot of Western blades that are sharpened tools. They\u2019re robust and they\u2019re durable, and you can use them for a multitude of different things. But fine cutting implements, we would not call them. We would call them sharpened tools. By contrast, the Japanese blades, at least the best Japanese blades that come from Japan, are considered to be precision cutting implements. They are designed and built and forged and quenched and tempered with cutting performance utmost in mind at the cost of everything else. So because of that philosophical difference, there\u2019s a lot of mechanical differences in how the blades are made and the mindset of the bladesmith making them. From the materials that are chosen to forge the blades, from the fuels in the fire that\u2019s used to heat the steel to forge it, the manner in which it is forged, the medium in which it\u2019s quenched, the dimensions to which it\u2019s ground, the effort to which the final cutting or primary edge is honed, is all affected or influenced by this philosophical, ideological difference between what the blades are supposed to be able to do in the end. Tim Ferriss: Could you describe some of these steps? For instance, I don\u2019t actually really know what forging is or involves. Or quenching or tempering. I don\u2019t really know what that looks like. Could you describe the process from ground zero when you\u2019re considering making a knife? What does the process look like? Murray Carter: I\u2019ll try to share with you what I\u2019ve learned in having forged and completed over 24,000 blades in my career. A lot of the things that I\u2019ve realized have come about at certain times of my experience. I\u2019m sure by the time I\u2019ve made 50,000, I might have a slightly different outlook altogether. One of the primary differences between a Western blade and a Japanese high-performance blade is the use of laminates. Most Western blades are homogenous in construction, meaning they\u2019re either all carbon steel from the spine all the way down to the cutting edge of the blade, or they\u2019re all stainless steel. But throughout, they\u2019re the same kind of steel. They\u2019re all manufactured from one solid billet of homogenous steel. In contrast, the Japanese blades are almost always a combination of two or more different kinds of steel. You\u2019ve heard the expression, \u201chave your cake and eat it too,\u201d well if you combine a hard and a soft steel together in the same package or in the same blade, the hard steel can be really hard and contribute to superior cutting performance. The soft steel can be left soft so that it\u2019s super tough, shock absorbing, avoiding breakage, and also easy to sharpen. It\u2019s very difficult to get the qualities of soft steel and hard steel out of a homogenous blade, because it\u2019s all the same. Right away, we\u2019re starting with a different blade construction, and that\u2019s a laminate. The most common blade construction in Japanese cutlery is a three-layer blade construction, often referred to as a san mai, which means three-layer or three-sheet-style construction, where the center of the laminate is the hard steel that\u2019s going to become the sharpened cutting edge like the lead in a pencil. The outer laminates are softer, either mild steel or a soft stainless. They strengthen, toughen, cushion, and make the blade easy to sharpen and very much act like the wood on the outside of the lead inside of the pencil; they support it. That\u2019s the most common. There\u2019s two-layer construction. Then there\u2019s sword construction, where the hard steel wraps around a soft center core and then you can have Damascus-style construction where you\u2019ve got hundreds of different layers all in different kind of constructs for either visual effect or metallurgical effect. But the laminated blade does give you the best of both worlds. It does allow you to have your cake and eat it too because you can have a really high Rockwell, a hardness core that means it can take a razor-sharp edge and hold that edge for a long time, but avoid the pitfall of being brittle because the outer, softer laminates support it and keep the whole blade from fracturing. Tim Ferriss: Right. And how does one make such a knife? What are the steps involved? Murray Carter: You achieve a laminated blade through a process called forge welding. Everyone knows if you hear the word \u201cwelding,\u201d you think of a mig or a tig or an inner-gas welder and a big spark and bright light. But literally, there\u2019s lots of different types of welding. There\u2019s ultrasound welding, there\u2019s welding with explosives, welding through friction and so on. But forge welding is the oldest form of welding known to mankind. That\u2019s when you take two metals that have similar temperature ranges and you heat them up until the molecules on the surface of each metal start to liquify, then you press the two together and if you\u2019re at the right temperature and you have clean surfaces, you can actually get the molecules from each surface of the metal to intermingle and fuse together. In layman\u2019s terms, it\u2019s like taking two candles that are cold and hard. You would heat up each end over a flame source until the end of the candle just started liquify. Then if you touch the ends of both candles together at the same time, in an ideal situation, you would end up with one big long candle once it cooled down because the wax would intermingle and mix. Fusing is different than melting the metals together, where you would make the two dissimilar metals molten and mix them up in a pot like you would stir chocolate milk powder into a glass of chocolate milk. It\u2019s not that kind of mixing. It\u2019s fusing them together in such a way that each unique layer still maintains it\u2019s original characteristics. That\u2019s done in a forge. A forge is a source of heat. We have gas forges. We have electric forges. Then we have what I use, which is a solid fuel forge. Tim Ferriss: What does solid fuel mean? Murray Carter: I burn up coke in my forge. Spoonfuls at a time. Tim Ferriss: What is coke? Are we talking Coca-Cola? Cocaine? Something else? Murray Carter: I just purchased four tons of coke the other day. Coke is \u2013 all joking aside \u2013 it\u2019s coal as they dig it up from the ground and it\u2019s heated once in the absence of oxygen. It drives off all the impurities, namely phosphorous and sulfur, which are combustible gases that are very undesirable when it comes to heating steel to make knives. Coke is to coal what charcoal is to wood. Tim Ferriss: I see. Got it. Murray Carter: It\u2019s just purified carbon because all of the volatile gases have been driven off. Tim Ferriss: How is that spelled? Murray Carter: C-O-K-E. Tim Ferriss: Oh, it is? I was going to say, a couple of tons of coke \u2013 unless you have a very sophisticated drug-smuggling operation and a huge budget, it\u2019s probably something else. So that is solid fuel? Murray Carter: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s solid fuel forge. So you\u2019re fusing these different layers together and maintaining the integrity in the sense that the separation of these layers, so you can design a knife that allows you to have your cake and eat it too. What happens after that? Murray Carter: Once you\u2019ve successfully forge welded your different layers of steel together, then you need to forge that billet, which is what it\u2019s called, into a blade shape. Some blades are wide and short and some are narrow and long, like in the case of a slicing knife. Some are thicker and some are thinner. You can set out from your billet to forge any kind of blade you desire, providing you\u2019ve got enough material to make the blade you\u2019re setting out to make. It involves heating the steel to a plastic state, which is usually around 800\u00b0 C. Because I was in Japan and I was in Canada, for me, everything is Celsius. I don\u2019t translate to Fahrenheit very well, but I think it\u2019s something like 1350\u00b0 F. When you\u2019re at a campfire and you see the orange coals down at the very bottom and they\u2019re not bright yellow, they\u2019re just a really bright orange color, that\u2019s about 800\u00b0\u00a0C and that\u2019s the color we want the steel to be when we start hammering it. It\u2019s very pliable in that state. You don\u2019t want to heat the steel hotter than that because you can literally burn the steel and ruin it. You start hammering it. If you have enough force with the hammer, you can coax the steel into different shapes. Obviously, blacksmiths have been doing that for millennia. The difference is as a new bladesmith, one is overly focused on getting the right shape. Somewhere along the line, somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 blades, I realized that something more important was happening when I was forging the steel. That was grain refinement. As it turns out, if you heat your steel, your laminate, your billet of steel to that 800\u00b0 and then hammer the steel as it\u2019s cooling, you\u2019re actually refining the grain in this steel, which can result in a higher performing blade. So even if you start out making two different blades even out of the same steel, how you heat the steel and how you hammer it and how sequentially you heat the steel will result in two entirely different quality of blades. Tim Ferriss: When you say grain, I\u2019m thinking of cutting against the grain or with the grain in say, cutting steak. Is it a direction of fibers in the steel itself? What\u2019s the best way to think of refining grain? Murray Carter: If you\u2019ve ever fractured a piece of metal and looked at it, it\u2019s quite likely, even if it was aluminum or whatever, you look at the metal fractured surface and it looks like little grains of sand. It looks granular. Sometimes it looks finely granular and you have to look very closely to discern different bumps in the fractured surface. Sometimes, it\u2019s very coarse. Basically, steel has grain which you can think of like marbles or BBs or grains of sand. The finer they are and more evenly dispersed they are throughout the steel matrix or throughout the billet, the finer of a cutting implement will result. The reason is that it\u2019s not the grains themselves that make steel strong, but the grain boundary. Where one grain touches another grain, there\u2019s something about that boundary complexity that increases the strength of steel. The finer grain you can achieve in steel, the more grain boundary that results, and therefore a better end product. Tim Ferriss: You have, as you said, forged or produced somewhere along the line of 24,000 blades. You spent 18 years in Japan. And yet, this is another part of your story or life that really grabbed my attention, you hold classes or workshops where people can come in and over the course of a week or a few days, walk away with a blade. Is that fair to say? Murray Carter: Yeah. I\u2019ve been doing that for five or six years now. Tim Ferriss: After putting in the amount of time to master your craft that you\u2019ve put in, what does the curriculum look like for a two or three-day class? Because you\u2019ve clearly put so much thought into this. How do you teach this? I always think about sequencing. When you\u2019re learning a language, how you provide positive feedback but balance that with some kind of logical progression that is graspable. What does such a class look like when you\u2019re teaching it? Murray Carter: The way we\u2019ve talked about 24,000 blades in 18 years, it sounds daunting and impossible to learn anything important in such a short timeframe as one week. But fortunately, that\u2019s not true. Bladesmithing is not rocket science. A lot of the mystique and lore of bladesmithing is simply because a lot of the obvious things about blades are hidden in plain sight and not often revealed and not often taught. What I mean by that, let me quantity that, the main skill that I teach or confer in a short amount of time is I teach students how to use their eyes and how to see what\u2019s actually there. Obviously, we were talking earlier about grain and steel and so on. We don\u2019t actually get out microscopes and look at that. I teach them to see if blades are straight. I can teach them to see if the blades have the profiles that they\u2019re looking for as they grind the blades. I teach them to pinpoint troubles areas and then pinpoint the remedy for that. Like with grinders or a hammer or a file or whatnot. I teach them through repetition. I teach them to start to rely upon their eyes and to trust their eyes so that when they actually see something, they know what they\u2019re really looking at. In terms of the metallurgy after we forge, and anneal, and quench, and temper blades and then grind them, I teach them simple things like how to test to see if the edge of the blade or if the whole blade actually hardened by cutting into other metal objects. I teach them to do a rudimentary test to see if they\u2019ve got fine grain and if they quenched it at the right temperature and tempered it properly, when if they push a thin edge against an object like a brass rod, they should be able to see the edge flex and then when the pressure\u2019s removed, they should see that flexed portion spring back to a true edge again. Last but not lease, part of what we do is we place a lot of emphasis on hand sharpening of the knives on sharpening stones. I teach them to pay attention to how the blade that they forged and heat treated, how it feels on the stone when they\u2019re sharpening it. Between a sense of touch and feel and using one\u2019s eyesight, it\u2019s actually a remarkable testament to the human condition to report just how much the average student can learn in the space of a week. It\u2019s really remarkable. Tim Ferriss: If you were looking back at the students you\u2019ve taught, the people you\u2019ve encountered in the process of teaching and making knives certainly, if you were in charge of talent scouting \u2013 let\u2019s just treat it as the Oakland Athletics Moneyball type of approach. Your job is to put together, it\u2019s slightly different, but you\u2019re trying to put together a team of people who have the potential be great bladesmiths. What are the attributes that you\u2019re looking for to put together that team? How would you try to spot the potential for someone who can be great at this? What are the patterns you\u2019ve noticed or things you\u2019ve observed? Murray Carter: Well, that\u2019s a very timely question, Tim. Because we actually are actively growing Carter Cutlery and as we spent the last week hiring our tenth employee. So a very timely question. I look for two very specific things. I look for aptitude and attitude. The aptitude is somebody\u2019s ability to acquire new skills or to use the skills that they already have. I look for attitude, which is a willingness to learn; a willingness to be humble; a willingness to stick to something once you\u2019ve decided that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do, so sticktoitiveness; and a willingness to work in a team environment. Those two qualities specifically are what I\u2019m looking for. Tim Ferriss: On the aptitude side of things, the ability to learn, the ability to be humble, the ability to stick, the sticktoitiveness, and the teamwork, how do you test for that? In other words, how do you determine if someone has that or not? Murray Carter: The attitude. Tim Ferriss: Yes, exactly. Any of those things. In other words, if you\u2019re looking at it as a hiring process, so some people use interviews, some people use test projects for hiring for many different skills. How do you determine if someone has the capacity to learn, the ability to be humble, stick to something, and work in a team? Murray Carter: Unfortunately, I found that the only accurate way to make that assessment is to put the candidate in the actual work environment. Because two things can happen: people who claim to have great aptitude and attitude will reveal that they actually aren\u2019t that equipped for that position. And conversely, people who think they might be, once they get into that environment and are encouraged in the right way, and surrounded by the right kind of people, can actually develop a healthier mindset better than they even came into the interview with. That can be nurtured. I think the best solution is to get the applicant in the working environment and then just work with them as closely as possible and encourage them in every way you can and be in constant communication with them. I think usually within a week or two, you have a much better idea than simply an interview or viewing a portfolio or reading a resume alone can provide. Tim Ferriss: For sure. And for those people listening who would like to explore this aspect of business, meaning hiring or even more specifically, auditioning people, Matt Mullenweg, who\u2019s been on the podcast, CEO of Automattic, thought of as the lead developer of WordPress, has a very fascinating process for auditioning people, whether they are the entry-level customer support or a CFO. The process is remarkably similar. That\u2019s worth digging into. I have a couple of questions that are really not organized by any particular theme. I\u2019m just curious to know the answer. The first is, in many knives that are supposedly Japanese style that you can buy easily in the West, you find these dimples on the sides of the knives. Sometimes they\u2019re called Santoku, sometimes they\u2019re called something else. What are the functions of those dimples? Do they matter? Are they done well? How should someone think about those if they really have no familiarity with knives? Murray Carter: Well, I think what you might be referring to are kind of like a hammered texture into the upper surface of the blade. What you might be referring to is what\u2019s called a Granton edge, where the steel is actually scalloped out? Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. I looks like, I think it\u2019s concave, I think I\u2019m getting this right, say ellipse or semi-circular carve out. Murray Carter: Yeah, and Henckels is well known for that. They put out a kind of a Japanese-style Santoku-shaped blade that has a Granton edge where right behind the primary cutting edge of the blade are these scalloped out depressions in the blade. And the concept is that when you\u2019re cutting something that has a high moisture content like cucumbers or tomatoes or whatnot, rather than sticking to the blade and then being pushed up by subsequent slides to the top of the spine of the blade and then being bopped off the blade and rolling off the table and onto the floor, the idea is as you\u2019re cutting, the cut material will separate more easily from the secondary edge of the blade. In concept, it can work. I don\u2019t like it for several reasons. First of all, if you have a blade that is thick enough behind the cutting edge to grind in scalloped indentations, for me that means the blade is simply too thick. Because the thicker the blade, the more resistance there is to push the blade through things. Many people need to understand that when we think of the words \u201csharp\u201d and \u201cblade,\u201d there\u2019s actually two phenomena: there\u2019s the primary edge, which is the part of the blade that everyone thinks of when we think of sharp that initiates the cut. It\u2019s the part that goes into your finger first, before you see the blood. Then there\u2019s the secondary edge, which is the geometry of steel behind the primary edge. The secondary edge is what becomes consequential when you\u2019re actually trying to push the blade through things, whether it\u2019s an acorn squash or a big, thick rubber stall mat that you might be standing on in your shop to save wear and tear on your feet or thick shoe leather. If you try to push a blade through things, then what\u2019s going on in the secondary edge is absolutely important. As much, if not more important, than the sharpness of the primary edge. In cooking, we often need to push the blade all the way through things, whether it\u2019s cucumber, carrot, apple, potato or what not, so the thinner the blade, the better. If you\u2019ve got a blade that\u2019s got Granton edges on it, your blade is simply too thick. One of the first things we do to remedy that when blades like that come into our shop for sharpening, refurbishment or repair is we grind the blade down by a certain percentage and remove some of those Granton edges. But the resulting thinness of the blade greatly enhances the cutting performance. The other thing I don\u2019t like about those is they\u2019re not necessarily sanitary. That\u2019s an area where bacteria and food particles can hide out in. In an ideal world, a blade for culinary use is very clean on both the primary and secondary surfaces. Once you\u2019re finished using it, you simply put it in a cloth and with one swipe, you can get the blade completely clean. So it\u2019s very low effort to keep it clean and sanitary. Tim Ferriss: Makes perfect sense. Having spent so much time in Japan, I would love to know if you have any favorite Japanese sayings or mantras or anything that have really stuck with you? I\u2019ll give people just a few examples of proverbs, for instance. Like [speaking Japanese]. There are some great ones. In English, as well, of course, but you have [speaking Japanese]. Even a monkey falls from a tree, which means it doesn\u2019t really matter how good you get, you can still fall on your face. There are also other uses. But then you have something that is actually pretty similar to tall poppy syndrome in say New Zealand and Australia, where people who stick out too much can be pulled down. That\u2019s [speaking Japanese]. The stake that sticks up gets hammered down. So if you stand up, you could be criticized. One that is great that I really like also is [speaking Japanese]. Not knowing is Buddha, literally, but it\u2019s ignorance is bliss, basically. Or what you don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt you. Is there anything, are there any sayings in Japanese or principles that have really stuck with you? Murray Carter: You know, Tim, you and I are really two birds of a feather. We share so many similarities and [speaking Japanese] was one of my areas of \u2013 I was kind of considered a nerd during Japanese language study at University of British Columbia because I loved coming in with new [speaking Japanese] to share with everybody. One of my favorites is [speaking Japanese]. Meaning when you feel yourself in a great hurry and a kind of a panic to get things done, that\u2019s the time to take a moment and regroup and take a deep breath and to really get your footing to make sure that you\u2019re making good decisions. So I really like that one. I like [speaking Japanese]. Proceeding so cautiously as to tap with a stick every single stone in a stone bridge as you cross it, just to make sure the stone bridge isn\u2019t going to fall down when you\u2019re on it. It\u2019s used often to illustrate an extreme level of caution and prudence. Tim Ferriss: And do you apply that in your life to knife making? To other things? Where does come to mind for you most? Murray Carter: Making business decisions. Tim Ferriss: I got it. Okay, right. Definitely measure twice, cut once. Murray Carter: Exactly. Except this would be like measure ten times. Tim Ferriss: Right. Murray Carter: Sometimes it\u2019s used to sarcastically, for someone who\u2019s so cautious that they become petrified from doing anything. I also like [speaking Japanese]. It\u2019s \u2013 and this is a special one in the cutlery industry, which is don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t be in a rush, but get the job done! Tim Ferriss: What was the first one that you mentioned? When you \u2013 Murray Carter: [Speaking Japanese]. Tim Ferriss: [Speaking Japanese]. That\u2019s such a good one. Yeah, when you feel rushed, when you feel like you have to get everything done this instant, that is a great time to hit pause. Murray Carter: And lastly, sometimes when we\u2019re in the blade shop and just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all and done it all and suffered every single setback that there ever could be in the blade shop, sometimes we become [speaking Japanese]. Which is a different version of your [speaking Japanese]. Meaning that anybody can fall. And [speaking Japanese] is when you become kind of bereft by some kind of unexpected setback, such as being run off by your wife or something like that. So when something in the shop goes awry in such a way as no one ever saw it coming, we can be the [speaking Japanese]. Tim Ferriss: I love it. Well, I know that we are coming up on time shortly, so I\u2019m not going to ask too many more questions. We could talk for days and days and days, I am sure. So maybe we\u2019ll do a Round 2 at some point. Murray Carter: Maybe we\u2019ll actually get to talking about bladesmithing and knives. Tim Ferriss: Well, yeah, I think that the people who are with us at this point in this conversation are already converted and fascinated. They are more interested in knives now than they were when they turned this on. I think we could talk for days about many different aspects of knife making and the shared DNA that we have through Japan. Let me ask just a handful more. I\u2019m already happy with the conversation. I\u2019ll use this to round it out. What books have you gifted the most to other people or re-read the most yourself? Murray Carter: As a child, I was fascinated with the book Ivanhoe. I love the story of knights and their heroism and altruism and fighting for a great cause. I kind of have a romantic notion of right and wrong and good and evil. But in terms of the book I\u2019ve given away the most, of course that would be Bladesmithing with Murray Carter, of course the book that I first authored. It was the first of three books that I\u2019ve authored. It\u2019s a great instructional book on bladesmithing techniques in general, but more specifically the application of traditional Japanese bladesmithing techniques. Tim Ferriss: Besides your own books, which I also recommend people check out, for sure, any others that you\u2019ve gifted to people that come to mind? Murray Carter: I would say I\u2019m probably delinquent in the fact that I\u2019ve not given many books as presents in my lifetime. Thank you for the idea. I now have next year\u2019s Christmas presents figured out. Tim Ferriss: All right, well let\u2019s look at it differently. When you gift, are there any items that you routinely gift to people? If the answer is knives, what is your go-to gift knife? What type of knife? What characterizes it? Murray Carter: Probably the most noteworthy is the fact that I wear a knife daily, usually in the form of a neck knife. It\u2019s the kind of knife that we hang from our neck, inverted upside down, very securely, in a thermoplastic sheath called Kydex. It\u2019s a really handy blade to have. It\u2019s the alternative to a folding knife in the pocket. There\u2019s no mechanism to break, it\u2019s easy to sharpen, easy to maintain and very strong for its size, and has excellent cutting potential. I\u2019ve been carrying neck knives for my whole career as a bladesmith. I typically will meet some person who inspires me in some way. They might be a young child, it might be the son of a good friend. It might a housewife who I think could use some protection while walking in the park. But I have given more knives off of my own neck than I\u2019ve used for several weeks or months or years, that I know are really good high-performing, great cutting knives. I gifted a lot of those away. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a great answer. I love \u2013 neck knives. This is also something that I\u2019ve been somewhat obsessed with in the last few weeks. That\u2019s a to-be-continued. Murray Carter: So when are you going to come and take a class? Tim Ferriss: You know what? When we hit stop on this recording, I want to talk to you about that because it\u2019s something I would like to do ASAP, ideally before the time that this episode comes out, or at least get a reservation in. The last two questions: this is one, if you had a gigantic billboard \u2013 this is more of a metaphorical question, but you could put a short message on that billboard to get it out to millions of people, that is non-commercial, what would that or what might that message be? Murray Carter: Well, I could put something clich\u00e9 on there like \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up.\u201d I could put \u201cStick to the Plan.\u201d I had written on my walls over in my Japanese shop, \u201cStick to the Plan,\u201d and the other one under that was \u201cConcentrate on the Task at Hand.\u201d It\u2019s so easy to get distracted from new stimuli that focusing and concentrating on the task at hand is often, even though it\u2019s a simple concept, it\u2019s difficult to execute. Those are some truisms or sayings that I live by. Tim Ferriss: What does Stick to the Plan mean to you most often? Why is that one of the two that you chose? Murray Carter: Well, in quiet moments, we all sit down, either alone or with loved ones or people we trust and we plan. Humans plan. They say at first of these three things that probably need to happen, we should do this first, and then this second, and then lastly we\u2019ll achieve this. And as is so common in life, people sabotage their own plans. They get to a certain part of the plan and it becomes monotonous or tedious or difficult or challenging. All of a sudden, instead of sticking with the plan and seeing it through to completion, they think, what I need is a new plan. So you have people who habitually, chronically are in the process of making new plans and never actually execute a single one of their existing plans. Tim Ferriss: Is that something that you\u2019ve struggled with? Or is that \u2013 it sounds you have that pretty well handled. So I\u2019m wondering is it more of a reminder for your employees? How have you used that reminder in your life or for other people? Murray Carter: You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been lucky to have stuck to most of my plans and achieved the goals I\u2019ve set out for myself because I\u2019ve constantly reminded myself to stick to the plan. Tim Ferriss: Good answer. Very good answer. Do you have any parting \u2013 and I\u2019m also going to ask you before we wrap up where people can find out more about you and so on. I\u2019ll put those links in the show notes for everyone. Any parting comments, requests, thoughts for the people who are listening to this? Murray Carter: Well, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for listening. Of course, they can find out more about our knives at cartercutlery.com. We do strive to make the finest knives in the world. High-performance blades that are also very easy to maintain. We\u2019ve successfully encouraged and mentored tens of thousands of people to learn the very easily attainable skill of sharpening knives. We\u2019ve kind of revitalized that essential skill and given a lot of people the great feeling of a mastery and satisfactory over their cutlery in being able to maintain it and sharpen it and use it to their heart\u2019s content. Tim Ferriss: Could you give \u2013 just with that teaser \u2013 could you name one thing you wish more people did related to knife sharpening or one thing you wish people would stop doing? Murray Carter: I\u2019ll give a little freebie out there for everybody. That is when they get a new piece of cutlery, especially one for the kitchen, if they will just keep that cutting edge from touching anything other than food \u2013 meaning don\u2019t drop it in your kitchen sink, don\u2019t let it touch other plates and pans. Don\u2019t let it touch the other silverware in the drawer. That will preserve the cutting edge, the primary edge of that knife, far longer than they ever thought possible. It\u2019s the clanging around of the knives, the misplacement of the knives in the kitchen that really dulls them. That\u2019s a little freebie for everybody. Tim Ferriss: So they shouldn\u2019t use their kitchen knives for opening boxes from Amazon, in other words? Murray Carter: They can do that after they master sharpening. Then I don\u2019t care what they use their knife for because it\u2019s only a couple of minutes before they can refresh both primary and secondary edges of their knives. That\u2019s freedom. That\u2019s the real freedom. [Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: That is the freedom, when you can maintain and master your own tools. Everybody listening, you can also find Carter Cutlery on Facebook. Facebook.com/cartercutlery. Instagram \u2013 fantastic Instagram \u2013 also cartercutlery. I will put all links to everything we\u2019ve discussed in the show notes, as usual so everybody listening can find all of that, as well as more resources and so on, at tim.blog/podcast for this episode and every other episode. Carter \u2013 I always want to call you Carter. I have a good friend named Carter. Murray, thank you so much for taking the time. There\u2019s an expression in Japanese which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard before, which is [speaking Japanese]. So when you do something and you never want to do it again, that\u2019s [speaking Japanese]. I have the exact opposite feeling with this conversation. I hope we have many, many more. Thank you for taking the time4. Murray Carter: [Speaking Japanese]. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. [Speaking Japanese]. And as some of my Japanese friends said to me with this bewildered face in high school, they would say [speaking Japanese]. So I have that feeling with you, which is that you are secretly partly Japanese, which I mean as the highest compliment. To be continued. Thank you again. To everybody listening, as always, thank you and continue to do experiments, be nice, and be safe.

"1", "no 2 is that i felt like you were somehow brought to me, not to get too woo-woo", "but just in the last few months, i\u2019ve had a close friend who\u2019s former special operations, tell me that i had to take a class of yours, at the very least, to make an inek knife or some other type of knife, to try to learn the craft", "i then also spent time last week with a well-known film director whose son has become a huge fan of yours and is studying the craft", "on many levels, i think that this was, in some form, destined to be", "i would love to start with just a little bit of background", "i think maybe the easiest way to jump into it is to cover where you grew up and how japan entered the picture", "sure, i\u2019d be happy to share that story with you", "i grew up in halifax, nova scotia, canada", "at a very young age, i became very interested in martial arts and military history and kind of the outdoors", "watching movies like jeremiah johnson and so on gave me a great fascination for tools and knives and weapons and so on", "when i was 15 years old, i was lucky to attend a regional karate competition as a guest, as an observer", "that really piqued my interest", "i actually enrolled in a karate dojo and did that for several years", "that started my real fascination with japan", "then, of course, i coupled that interest with reading books about the martial arts and ninjas and so on", "of course, samurais and samurai swords and the blades that they used", "that\u2019s kind of where the fascination with japan started", "when did that become, and how did that become, an opportunity to go to japan", "in terms of age, you were 15 or so at the time", "i started karate when i was 15", "that would be in high school", "i graduated when i was 17 and then turned 18 that summer", "i worked for a full year \u2013 well, i worked for several months and then in the spring of the following year, while i was still 18, i did travel to japan", "the destination within japan was pre-determined for me \u2013 that was the prefecture called kumamoto prefecture on the island of kyushu, the southernmost of the four main island in japan \u2013 because that\u2019s where the karate dojo was located that i was going to attend to further and continue my studies in karate", "what type of karate was that", "it\u2019s called chit\u014d-ry\u016b, it\u2019s spelled c-h-i-t-o, hyphen, r-y-u", "it\u2019s a version of shit\u014d-ry\u016b, which is a little bit more well known", "i guess it originates from okinawa", "one of the main features of chit\u014d-ry\u016b was a higher, more mobile stance than a lot of the other traditional forms of karate like sh\u014dt\u014dkan or goj\u016b-ry\u016b, which have very low, very low center of gravity stances for solidity, but lacking maybe a little bit in mobility and flexibility", "when i first came across a few of the snippets of your bio, i thought to myself, okay, this is really a conversation that has to happen because one of the most life-changing events in my life was in 1992, i was in high school 15, and i had the opportunity to switch out of spanish class because i\u2019d concluded i was bad at spanish, into a different language", "my friends were in japanese class", "i was always fascinated by martial arts, ninjas and so on", "i went to japanese class and six months later, had the opportunity to leave the u.s", "on my first extended trip overseas to a sister school, which was in tokyo", "at 15, went to tokyo and stayed there for a year in a japanese school and with a japanese family", "this is not really a digression, because i feel like i want to share this with you, so there\u2019s a little bit of common ground", "i remember the first time i went to a karate school in japan to take a class", "i went to a seid\u014d-kai school", "that was my first introduction to leg kicks", "mainly on the receiving end", "i remember \u2013 you were the punching bag", "i was the punching bag", "i remember that i came in and they\u2019re like, oh, this former \u2013 or at the time, current wrestler, foreigner", "i was the only one in the school", "they\u2019re like okay, let\u2019s see how you move around", "no head contact", "so i\u2019m punching this guy in the chest and every time i punched him in the chest, he would kick me in the leg", "i said, that\u2019s a great trade", "i\u2019m just going to punch you in the chest all day and you can kick me in the leg as many times as you want", "i couldn\u2019t go to school the next day", "because your leg was all swollen", "because my leg was ruined", "how did you then go from \u2013 i guess two questions", "no", "1 is, how did the opportunity come about for you to travel to japan to further your studies", "and then secondly, where did blades come into play", "when i was in high school, i really caught a travel bug that kind of fed into my fierce, independent spirit", "although it wasn\u2019t really popular at the time, i started hitchhiking when i was 14 years old and i found the wondrous joys of being able to hike out to a highway and stick my thumb out and get to places i wanted to get to without having to save up money to buy my own car or pay for the insurance or the gasoline", "it was a wonderful experience", "i traveled all over the province of nova scotia doing that", "the more i did it, the more obsessed and compelled i felt to do that", "by the time i was 16 years old, i actually traveled to europe by myself over the school christmas vacation", "i spent three weeks in europe visiting some acquaintances and also venturing to places i had never been by myself before", "after high school, i was very keen to travel", "although i had this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that studies were awaiting and that there was an expectation, both self-incurred and through my family, to attend higher education, i couldn\u2019t ignore the overwhelming desire to travel", "after high school, i started to put this trip together that really was supposed to be an around-the-world tour", "when i was still in high school, one of the seniors who had graduated two years before me had done an around-the-world tour", "at the time, i believe you could, through some different airlines, you could purchase a very special plane ticket where so long as you kept moving in the same direction around the globe, for one set fare, it was something like $6,000 at the time", "you could continue to keep flying to different destinations as long as you kept moving in one direction so that eventually you would end up in the same place that you started from and then your ticket would expire", "it was an around-the-world airfare, basically", "when this senior came back from his world trip, his story was featured in the local newspaper", "i read it in its entirety and became very inspired", "i thought, wow, that\u2019s exactly what i want to do is emulate this around-the-world tour", "i concocted a plan that would have me hitchhike across north america and then from the west coast, depart to japan and stay there for six months, where i would continue and further my education in karate and hopefully have some sort of cultural experience while i was there", "but i didn\u2019t know what that was going to look like", "from there, i was going to travel around the rest of southeast asia", "i had planned to take a cargo ship, i think, from there to india and then another cargo ship from india to africa and travel through africa and up through europe and back to nova scotia, my hometown", "that was the plan", "i had budgeted time for it", "i had budgeted money for it", "i was in the process of actively trying to establish connections and links and leads so that i would know people at some of these destinations i was hoping to get to", "i probably had 30 or 40 percent of it figured out and the rest i was just going to wing as i went along", "that\u2019s a good ratio", "i think that\u2019s actually a very good ratio", "well, just like your friends in certain communities, the high-speed, low-drag", "there\u2019s a beauty to not being chained down with too many plans or promises", "as a friend of mine, rolf potts, who wrote a book that had a huge impact on me, called vagabonding, who is a long-time, long-term traveler", "ultimately, the ability to improvise is more valuable than a lot of the planning you do on the front end, which you put differently", "so you get to japan", "you have this 40 percent figured out, what happens", "as fate would have it, i immediately enrolled in the karate dojo, what they call a hombu dojo, which is like the headquarters of our style of chit\u014d-ry\u016b karate", "i just want to say, i want to put a plug in there that they were very kind to me and it was a great experience", "i can\u2019t say enough kind things about the people that i met there addition the sensei who was there", "i digress", "i was very keen and every morning started at 6:00, where we would meet and go into a special tatami mat room, light incense, and give homage to the ancestors of the karate sensei\u2019s family, who started the whole thing, who had passed on", "then we would go to each corner of the room, each one of the participants, and sit in zazen", "basically, you sit on your knees with your feet tucked up underneath your buttocks, for 30 minutes", "it was absolutely excruciating", "your feet would fall asleep and you were wondering why in the world you traveled across the globe to find yourself sitting in this excruciating position for 30 minutes every morning", "after that, 6:30, the bell would ring, much to our relief", "then we would go off and we would meet in the karate dojo at 6:45", "we had practices every morning like that and then we had practices three times \u2013 i think it was monday, wednesday, friday, in the evenings", "i was just in karate heaven", "i was practicing with some guys who would progress on to be world champions", "i really was amongst some great skill and talent and dedicated folks", "but what happened, the connection to knives was this", "roughly around the fourth week of practicing, karate, it was one of those evening practices", "we were doing, let\u2019s see if i can recall what it\u2019s called, a jumping, flying side kick", "you would run up as if you were going to do the triple jump, and launch yourself into the air and do a side kick at some imaginary target", "no one ever taught you that if you actually made contact in that position what you would do next", "mostly it was just flying through the air", "i think we were very ill-prepared for actually kicking anything in that manner", "you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to go running up and jump at a wall and try to kick it because i don\u2019t think the outcome would be very favorable", "anyway, when i was coming down to land from that position, i didn\u2019t quite have my feet and knees in front of me", "i very much had one of my legs \u2013 i think it was my left leg", "i was kicking with my right leg and my left leg, when i came down and landed, i dislocated my knee", "fortunately, it was kind of a mild dislocation", "but it was a dislocation nonetheless", "i had to go to the hospital and get a much of liquid removed from somewhere in the knee joint", "the doctor there put a cast on my leg that basically went from my left ankle all the way up to the top of my thigh on my left leg", "he said i had to keep it on for three weeks", "that\u2019s the curse of being an 18-year-old; you think you\u2019re invincible", "so of course, i convinced him to take it off after one week and i never ever fully recovered", "in fact, it turns out i\u2019ve got a completely torn acl and i\u2019ve been living with it and managing just fine for all these years ever since", "almost 30 years later; i\u2019m 47 now", "now i\u2019m immobile and i\u2019m the karate dojo in the barracks, we\u2019ll call it", "not really able to practice", "the karate teacher comes in, chit\u014dse-sensei was his name; a great man", "he threw a japanese language textbook at me", "i couldn\u2019t tell if it was an aggressive throw or a kind toss, but either way, it really was an amazing gift", "up to that point, i had acquired no japanese language ability", "here was a textbook that was a very well-written textbook", "i started to read it and work through the problems and started to study the language", "that changed everything", "what was the consequence of adding some japanese speaking ability to your skillset at that point", "well, i think you\u2019re aware because i could tell from the way you\u2019ve spoken some japanese words that you\u2019ve acquired quite a level of proficiency in the language", "it opened up a whole lot more doors to me", "of course it opened up conversation", "it opened up friendships", "it opened up the possibilities of travel, pursuing hobbies outside of karate", "i thought that i had a very open mind when i went to japan, but in hindsight, really i was just bonkers for karate and i really wasn\u2019t seeing much outside of that world", "but once i started to learn the language and made some friends who were outside of the karate circle, that\u2019s when everything really opened up for me and a lot of doors opened", "that\u2019s what opened up the possibility to start studying bladesmithing", "i had a very similar experience", "different domain, but not too dissimilar", "i went to a school in tokyo called seikei gakuen, which is in kichijoji", "for those people eager to visit tokyo, the inokashira park is right next to or very close to where this school is located", "as a student, i had to wear the uniform which looks sort of like a chinese, mandarin-collared, odd-looking seifuku, as they call it", "i\u2019m glad they had your size", "yeah, they needed to do some special work to get a first-year high school student to fit this jacket", "i was actually very fond of having a uniform", "it simplified things dramatically", "i had this uniform and as part of the school, it was very much where\u2019s waldo in the sense that i could easily be spotted as the only american in this school of 5,000 japanese", "everyone had to do bukasa", "bukasa is \u2013 after-school activities", "exactly", "you have to choose a club", "it is mandatory or it was, at least, at seikei", "the clubs that were eager or interested in potentially having me were rugby", "because they\u2019re like all right, you\u2019re bigger than most first years, so that\u2019ll be an asset", "kendo, which i was interested in already and that\u2019s where i thought i was headed", "and then judo approached me", "i thought judo at the time was very much like aikido where some guy comes at with this very exaggerated faux knife thrust and then you whip him around and steven segal him to the ground", "i was like, well, that\u2019s not terribly interesting to me because from all the wrestling and so on that i\u2019ve done, i\u2019m more interested in a resisting opponent", "the judo guys taught me or showed me very quickly that judo is very much full contact and really similar to wrestling", "at the time, i couldn\u2019t read a single kanji \u2013 for people listening, chinese characters adopted by the japanese", "i had a basic grasp of the syllabaries of japanese, so the hirajana and kanatana, but otherwise, was really at a \u201cwhere is the bathroom", "thank you", "good morning\u201d level of japanese", "it wasn\u2019t until i had the motivation to get better at judo and realized that the best textbooks were all in japanese, at the time at least, and then had friends support me by pointing me to comic books that i could use to learn dialogue, that all the doors opened up, as you said", "i just want to speak in defense of japanese people for a second here, which is to say that a lot of non-japanese who visit japan and they\u2019re like, \u201cah, the inscrutable japanese", "they\u2019re so xenophobic and they\u2019re so hard to connect with.\u201d i don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually a fair assessment in most cases", "the japanese \u2013 this is a bit of a rant, so bear with me \u2013 but when the gods of the universe were handing out phoniums and sounds, the japanese got a pretty short hand", "they didn\u2019t get a lot of sounds, so japanese are very insecure about their ability in other languages and have trouble, as most people know, distinguishing between l and r and so on", "as a result, they have a very rote-driven approach to memorizing vocab, but they shy away from speaking or trying to speak english", "i think that is, at least in my experience, the main barrier", "as soon as you speak, even if you can hold a two-minute conversation or you have a dozen phrases memorized, they will literally clap their hands", "you\u2019ve seen this", "they\u2019ll go, [speaking japanese]", "[speaking japanese]", "yeah, exactly", "the response that you get is so exaggerated, but wonderful", "in japan that as soon as you make the effort, all of the doors open", "i\u2019m going to shut up now", "but i hate to hear the japanese described as so arms-distance and so on, from people who have not taken the time to learn even ten words in japanese", "so i get very excited and i feel like there\u2019s someone who\u2019s had a similar experience", "how did the blades then come into the picture", "just before i get into that, i wanted to comment on your experience in japan", "it\u2019s cool that we were in japan at the same time, since i\u2019ve been there since 1988", "so in \u201992, i was up to my eyeballs in bladesmithing and all sorts of other things", "i just wanted to say that your astute observations about the japanese culture and the way you picked up the language and the unique experience that you had, it\u2019s commendable really", "because i think you understand that all the 10,000 other people who\u2019ve had a similar experience to you, your understanding and appreciation and comprehension of what you actually underwent and the japanese heart and the japanese psyche, the [speaking japanese], it\u2019s really commendable, your level of appreciation for what you underwent", "i appreciate that", "it was a complete life-changer for me", "it fundamentally changed my entire trajectory", "i\u2019m still in touch with my host family", "i had dinner with them about a month ago in japanese, 25 years later", "oh, wow, that\u2019s wonderful", "i don\u2019t know if you know, the day after tomorrow, i\u2019m actually going to japan", "i did not know that", "yeah, i\u2019m going over for nine days", "that\u2019s exciting", "i\u2019ve got an appointment to buy a new power hammer and i\u2019m going to visit with some steel manufacturers and then do the regular rounds of osaka, sakai, kyoto, fukui prefecture, up to see my teacher, mr", "yasuyuki sakemoto in nagano, and then back down to tokyo", "that\u2019s just around the corner for me", "so jealous", "this is a nice warm-up", "so you mentioned your teacher, your master", "your knee is taken out", "you have a book kindly or aggressively tossed at you \u2013 not sure \u2013 but nonetheless, is the tinder for getting you to dip your toe in japanese communication", "sure", "well, i like the tinder example because it certainly ignited quite a passion in me", "it certainly ignited that fuel", "what happened was i think within the first day i was at the karate dojo, one of the fellow students there, [inaudible] i think his name was", "he had a little scooter, of course the ubiquitous scooter all over the japan, the little 50cc scooters", "he was kind enough, since i had an international driver\u2019s license and was licensed to drive it, even though i didn\u2019t have much experience on two wheels, he let me borrow that scooter for a day in between karate in the morning and the evening karate class", "i just bravely \u2013 it\u2019s kind of crazy because i have no sense of direction and it was prior to the days of gps, but i just intrepidly took that scooter and started driving around", "i was probably into the third or fourth hour of my adventure, wondering if i was ever going to make it back to the karate dojo, that i drove past a very intriguing and interesting building", "i only caught it out of the corner of my eye because i was probably driving too fast", "it inspired me to put on the brakes and think, what did i just see", "i checked both ways and did a u-turn", "i drove back to this building and it was kind of like a [speaking japanese], a gate, an archway where there was a driveway entrance into an inner courtyard", "beside the gate was a display window with this huge, it\u2019s what they call a kujira b\u014dch\u014d, a huge whale meat filleting knife", "it was a display piece because of it\u2019s monstrous size", "it was pretty clear to me that there must be some knives beyond this gate", "i curiously went inside the courtyard and parked the little scooter", "then there were these glass doors into a building and i peered through the glass doors and i could see more knives on display shelves", "i think i probably knocked", "it was one of the squeaky doors on the rollers", "oh, sure", "yeah, of course they\u2019re all squeaky because [inaudible]", "they say that the squeaky hinge gets the grease, but that\u2019s not true in japan", "they just leave it squeaky", "i ventured in and i just became mesmerized by all these wonderful blades", "in three directions, there were just knives everywhere and two or three shelves all the way up to the ceiling", "there were sushi knives and deba b\u014dch\u014ds for breaking apart the fish", "there were thin filleting knives and vegetable knives, paring knives, and then there were all sorts of agricultural tools", "there were comma sickles and there were axes and different hatchets and different types of hoes for digging up the jamaimo and all sorts of fascinating things; tools i\u2019d never even seen before and couldn\u2019t identify", "i was there looking at all these blades and i don\u2019t even know how much time passed by", "i\u2019m guessing it was probably only a few minutes, but it could\u2019ve been hours", "i was so lost in thought and trying to absorb everything i was experiencing", "a man came in from the other side of the building", "he looked at me and saw i was a gaijin and he said, \u201chello.\u201d i guess we talked for a few minutes and i tried to communicate", "because at this point, i hadn\u2019t had the textbook tossed to me yet", "this came before then", "this was before i injured my knee", "it was literally the second day i was in kumamoto", "we talked for a few minutes and his wife brought out a couple of glasses of cold mugicha", "oh, it\u2019s my favorite thing in the world", "oh, you like mugicha", "i\u2019m not too fond of mugicha", "i\u2019m a huge fan, yeah", "this was in the summer", "buckwheat tea, because it was summer, so they serve it cold", "this was literally in june, the late part of june; so it was very hot", "after a few minutes of dialogue, because he could speak a word or two of english, i think i asked, \u201chey, can i come back some time?\u201d i think he said, [speaking japanese]", "he said \u201ccome back whenever you want.\u201d that was one of my first impressions of japan", "then i didn\u2019t visit him for many weeks", "then when the textbook was tossed to me, i think something must have clicked because i thought, that\u2019s the kind of person that if i could have deeper conversation with, i think it could be really rewarding", "that was one of the, as i said before, it was the tinder that fueled this desire and passion to be a communicator", "of course, the irony is having grown up in nova scotia, canada in the \u201870s, we were all spoon-fed the french language as canada\u2019s second language, basically from grade 1", "i had developed quite a \u2013 what can i say \u2013 a complex about the french language because i never really learned much because i was the class clown and i was always standing out in the hallway while all the other kids were in the class actually learning something", "i managed to get myself kicked out of so many french classes that i really didn\u2019t pick too much up", "when i was headed to japan and people said, murray, you should really try to learn japanese when you\u2019re over there because when you come back, you could get any job you want", "of course, that was in an era where everyone thought japan inc", "was going to take over the world", "japan was the focus of all the movies", "of course, die hard \u2013 the nakatomi building and the decadence and opulence of these rich, japanese corporations where they had lifelong employment", "it was really quite an enigma and the world was fascinated by japan", "everyone thought that japanese was going to be the \u2013 it was when everyone had a sony walkman, right", "they thought that japanese was going to be the trade language in the world", "people said, you\u2019re going to japan", "learn the japanese language and you\u2019ll be set for life", "i would agree with them, but it went in one ear and out the other because i\u2019m mumbling to myself under my breath like, yeah, right, i can\u2019t even speak a word of french and i\u2019ve been exposed to it for 12 years", "you expect me to learn japanese", "that\u2019s such a foreign language with a different alphabet", "come on, get serious", "i really didn\u2019t have any expectations of learning the language and that turned out to be the blessing in disguise, insomuch that i thought well, if i could just learn one word today, just one word, just how to say thank you or to say actually, no thank you", "i remember when someone tried to feed me raw fish liver and i couldn\u2019t say no thank you, so i had to eat it", "i thought, i\u2019m going home tonight, i\u2019m going to open up that textbook and find out where it says how to politely refuse raw fish liver", "it was from a fugu, nonetheless", "oh, god, yeah", "blowfish", "you\u2019ve got to be careful with the blowfish", "because i didn\u2019t have any preconceived notion of what i should or shouldn\u2019t be able to achieve in the language, i just literally took it one word at a time and took great delight and great pleasure in the new word that i would learn each day", "now flash forward, you have this textbook", "when did you go back to visit the knife shop again", "or what happened when you went back", "it\u2019s a great question", "of course, i ended up spending a lot of time there, so that\u2019s a question i should be able to answer", "i\u2019m just going to make it up because i can\u2019t remember exactly", "i stayed in japan that first stint for nine months", "first it was with karate and then i met the japanese bladesmith", "then i delved into a whole bunch of different things", "then i went back to north america and enrolled at advanced reading and writing japanese at the university of british columbia in vancouver, canada", "i took four years of study in 12 academic mods", "then i went back to japan", "that\u2019s when i immediately went to mr", "sakemoto and said, \u201ci\u2019m back", "i speak the language now and i really want to learn about bladesmithing.\u201d i may or may not have met him a couple of other times during that first nine-month stint, but honestly, i don\u2019t remember", "i want to hit pause to dig into one thing that you just said because it\u2019s fascinating", "did you just say you took four years of academic course load in 12 months", "yes, exactly", "okay", "so former class clown \u2013 is that a super human feat", "did you just go to class all day every day", "how did you go about \u2013 what were the keys to getting that done", "when i went for an interview with the dean of the japanese studies program, mr", "hiro soga at the time, who had actually written most of the textbooks in the day, i immediately took my interview with him in broken japanese", "i said, \u201cplease, please, please, let me take the 200-level classes, both the reading and writing and the conversation.\u201d as i was trying to have a conversation with him, he was correcting every second word i said", "he kept telling me, \u201cgrammar is everything.\u201d i said, \u201ccome on", "you understand what i\u2019m saying.\u201d he says, \u201cyes, but there\u2019s a big difference between \u2018i want to eat\u2019 and \u2018i\u2019ve eaten.\u2019 tense is everything.\u201d he was very gracious and he said, \u201clisten, if you study through the first year or 100-level textbooks in the next month and bring me evidence that you\u2019ve done all the exercises and passed some verbal examinations, then i\u2019ll also let you enroll immediately in the second-year classes.\u201d so i immediately enrolled in 200-level classes while on the side i was also completing all the course material for the 100-level, or first-year, classes", "if i enrolled in september, by the time the end of october came along in two months, i had finished all of those 100-level class workbooks and passed his expectations and i was getting a\u2019s in my 200-level classes", "i took the reading and writing and then the conversation class from september until probably april, when the university academic year ends", "then i enrolled in the spring six weeks intensive 300-level classes", "then when they finished, i took the six-week, intensive 400-level classes, which was reading japanese newspapers and conducting business in japanese and honorifics and so on", "that\u2019s how i managed to do all four year study in 12 calendar months", "so this was before you really took a deep dive with the bladesmithing", "exactly", "so what was driving that motivation to do so much and to really get after it", "was it the \u201chey, japan\u2019s going to take over the world?\u201d was that an element of it", "was it an inexplicable having caught some type of idea virus that you just couldn\u2019t kick related to japan", "did you know how you were going to use it", "i know i\u2019m throwing out a lot here", "but what was driving that studiousness", "because that isn\u2019t how it sounds like your academic career started", "what was driving that", "i want to be cute and say that japan had taken over my world", "i wasn\u2019t so concerned about it taking over anybody else\u2019s", "when i went to japan, something very magical happened", "you know the advice or the adage for youngsters for decades or even centuries has been go it on your own and find your own fame and fortune", "while i certainly hadn\u2019t found fame nor fortune, what i did find in japan was a part of me that i never knew existed", "as i mentioned before, i had grown up with a tremendous complex when it came to languages", "i had never really excelled at sports", "i felt in many ways that i probably hadn\u2019t lived up to my own father\u2019s expectations as the only boy, because i wasn\u2019t doing baseball or soccer or any of the things that all the other boys were interested in", "i spent most of my childhood inside watching tv and playing with lego and just wanting to do things with my hands", "i went to japan and then found out i had this latent skill for languages and i made all sorts of new friends", "nobody was judging me based on what i had accomplished thus far in my life", "it was all new, fresh relationships", "i really was, in many ways, able to reinvent myself", "it wasn\u2019t so much that i was reinventing myself as i was discovering parts of myself that i never knew existed", "i think that for any young person, whether it\u2019s a musical instrument or a language, or a sport, or really anything that they dedicate themselves to and gain a certain proficiency in, that kind of skill can give a young person so much confidence and open up so many other doors for them, and really be one of the greatest stepping stones from which to launch the rest of your life; to step out into life on", "as i was learning the japanese language and getting tremendously positive feedback, as you mentioned, from japanese people", "this was in the \u201880s, before foreigners had really penetrated every corner of japan", "i was down in kyushu and i remember if i saw a foreigner on the street, i\u2019d go [speaking japanese] because i never saw them there", "now, you see foreigners everywhere", "but back in those late \u201880s, it wasn\u2019t so common", "i got tremendously positive feedback from the people around me", "i started new friendships and they encouraged me in my language study", "i think for the first time in my life, i remember having feelings like wow, i\u2019ve got some skills", "i could really be somebody", "this is great", "i really want to see how far i can take this", "it gave me drive and passion and dedication that i never knew i possessed before", "in fact, i thought i was kind of a quitter growing up because that\u2019s what all the adult influences around me said", "i was a quitter and that i\u2019d amount to nothing", "i was quite delighted to find out that might not be true", "what a great story", "i had the \u2013 i\u2019m not going to say the exact same \u2013 but a very parallel experience", "i really shudder to think what my life would be like had i not had that year abroad, which is very uncommon, or i should say less common in the u.s", "than many other places where a gap year is encouraged", "i don\u2019t have kids, but i\u2019ve thought about if i would have any non-negotiables that i would insist on if i had kids, the only two that i\u2019ve really been able to come up with in terms of experiences are sports of some type and could be something that is thought of as unathletic, but let\u2019s just call it sports", "then a gap year or a year of traveling in a foreign environment", "because of everything that you just said", "i think it\u2019s just such an incredible opportunity to find yourself and to find your own confidence", "you mentioned honorifics", "for people who don\u2019t know what that is, there are many different levels or many different ways to speak or write or communicate with a japanese person depending on how old they are, depending on where they rank relative to you", "even in say a school environment, you would have sempai, like the upper classmen above you, and then the kohai below you and so on", "it determines what type of grammar, in some cases, you use", "i was going to ask you, i\u2019d love to hear when you then came back to yoshimoto-san, some people have heard san before \u2013 s-a-n", "then above that, you would have, -sama, right", "and then below that, let\u2019s say you\u2019re talking to a friend or a younger kid, you might say -kun or you could even use -chan, which is kind of similar to that", "what is the proper suffix for a master bladesmith", "would you formally refer \u2013 is there a master suffix that you would use for mr", "yoshimoto or is it simply yoshimoto-san", "well, most commonly, we just use the word \u201csensei.\u201d sensei", "okay, yoshimoto-sensei", "that\u2019s right", "so schoolteacher or politician or professor at university or master in the forge is \u201csensei.\u201d for people who are language nerds, just because i don\u2019t get a chance to explore this very much on many of my podcasts, so sensei is a really interesting word to look at or suffix to look at literally because you have sen, which is before, and then sei, which is born, in effect", "but in chinese, it\u2019s totally different", "it means mister", "you would say like [speaking japanese], is mister so you don\u2019t use it for a woman", "in the same way oddly enough like tegami, which is kind of hand paper, means letter in japanese, but in chinese or in mandarin, shojur is toilet paper", "there are a lot of things that are the same in both and a lot of things that are very different", "how did mr", "yoshimoto-sensei, how did he re-enter the picture for you", "first of all, i want to clarify one thing", "that i am 17th generation yoshimoto bladesmith, but my teacher\u2019s name is sakemoto", "okay, got it", "all right", "just for your listeners\u2019 pleasure, if they\u2019re interested in the content of this podcast, they can go to youtube and see the history of the yoshimoto bladesmiths", "on carter cutlery\u2019s channel", "so can see how yoshimoto became sakemoto because that, in itself, is a very interesting story", "but my teacher\u2019s name is sakemoto-sensei", "i got it, okay", "so sakemoto-sensei within the umbrella, or later then becoming or how that became yoshimoto", "we might delve into that", "so sakemoto-sensei", "yes", "could you tell us more about when it clicked", "what happened", "how did you \u2013 because ultimately i don\u2019t want to give away the punchline", "you\u2019re talking about, i want to say, let\u2019s see if i can get this part right, 18 years in japan", "yes, i was there 18 years", "i apprenticed with mr", "sakemoto for six years", "then basically i was asked by him to take over the family business", "he had two daughters and no sons and no hopeful apprentices apart from myself", "i guess i had demonstrated a certain attitude and aptitude for the family trade that he asked me to assume the position of 17th generation yoshimoto bladesmith", "he was, he is, because he\u2019s in nagano", "i\u2019m going to see him next week", "he is a very extraordinary human being", "he is very untraditional in the way we had a relationship of apprentice and sensei", "he was not strict, as you would imagine", "people think of the karate kid, wax on/wax off and standing there for hours on end", "doing menial tasks that the apprentice thinks must be meaningless and he\u2019s just being tested", "he\u2019s just having to sweep the floor to do the grunt labor for the teacher and starting to feel unappreciated and abused and so on", "that was not my story", "mr", "sakemoto was very gracious", "he would share with me all of his skills up front", "of course, i could only comprehend so many, so i would go and practice things he showed me and then he would show me more things", "but once we got to a certain point where he felt he had shared all of the essential bladesmithing and sharpening techniques with me that he regularly practiced, he did something out of the ordinary", "he said, \u201cmurray, if you really want to learn about forge welding, i\u2019m going to arrange for you to go down to kawashiri and spend some time down there because that\u2019s their area of expertise", "so i would go down to kawashiri and, in fact, i went off and on down to kawashiri for a couple of years and mastered the technique of forge welding", "i would always come back to sakemoto\u2019s forge and use it as my home base", "i would always apply and put into practice what i\u2019d learned there and elsewhere at the home forge", "then he would say, \u201cyou know, you really need to learn about the traditional japanese fishmongers\u2019 knives, nakataha, the deba b\u014dch\u014d, and the sashimi knife and all those two-layer, special, chisel-ground blades", "you should go to osaka, a little, special place called sakai, where they specialize in that skill.\u201d so off i went to sakai for several weeks", "i would be hooked up again, with some very gracious bladesmiths there", "i would learn their trade and i\u2019d come back to kumamoto to sakemoto\u2019s shop and then light the fire and try to emulate or put into practice the things i\u2019d learned", "i\u2019d show them to him and he\u2019d say, \u201cokay, now you\u2019re getting somewhere", "now you need to learn a little bit about marketing and the overall financial aspect of running a business making knives", "you need to go to seki city, japan, because those guys are really savvy businessmen when it comes to the cutlery industry up there.\u201d so off i would go to seki city, japan and learn what i could up there", "and again, always come back to mr", "sakemoto and then ply what i had learned", "he taught me many important things, but he also coached me", "he was a very gracious coach and never cool or strict or punitive, even when he probably should have been", "a very kind and the most tolerant and understanding and patient sensei you could ever have asked for", "that\u2019s such an amazing opportunity, just incredible", "for people who are listening, and i\u2019ll be honest, i would say i\u2019m in this group as well, who don\u2019t know the steps involved with japanese bladesmithing, who don\u2019t even know what forge welding is, which i would certainly raise my hand as it relates to that", "could you describe what makes japanese bladesmithing", "there\u2019s certainly a prized quality that goes along with japanese knives", "i wrote a book relating to cooking and learning some time ago, called the 4-hour chef", "i spent a lot of time with high-end chefs around the united states, in san francisco, new york city, and so on", "almost every single one has at least one japanese knife that they treat like a lamborghini", "it\u2019s only taken out for special occasions", "it\u2019s meticulously cared for", "could you describe the steps in making a knife in the japanese style and what is unique about it", "sure", "there\u2019s so much to say on that topic", "i\u2019ll just try to keep it concise and interesting for your listeners", "first of all, there\u2019s a fundamental, philosophical difference between what i\u2019m just going to loosely term \u201cwestern cutlery\u201d and \u201cjapanese cutlery.\u201d everybody knows from movies like kill bill and so on, just how revered the samurai sword can be", "people even know that often they were christened with their own names and considered by their owners to have legendary qualities", "some of the big, philosophical differences are that western culture puts a high value on something being durable and strong and tough and robust", "as a result, as that extends to cutlery, we end up with a lot of western blades that are sharpened tools", "they\u2019re robust and they\u2019re durable, and you can use them for a multitude of different things", "but fine cutting implements, we would not call them", "we would call them sharpened tools", "by contrast, the japanese blades, at least the best japanese blades that come from japan, are considered to be precision cutting implements", "they are designed and built and forged and quenched and tempered with cutting performance utmost in mind at the cost of everything else", "so because of that philosophical difference, there\u2019s a lot of mechanical differences in how the blades are made and the mindset of the bladesmith making them", "from the materials that are chosen to forge the blades, from the fuels in the fire that\u2019s used to heat the steel to forge it, the manner in which it is forged, the medium in which it\u2019s quenched, the dimensions to which it\u2019s ground, the effort to which the final cutting or primary edge is honed, is all affected or influenced by this philosophical, ideological difference between what the blades are supposed to be able to do in the end", "could you describe some of these steps", "for instance, i don\u2019t actually really know what forging is or involves", "or quenching or tempering", "i don\u2019t really know what that looks like", "could you describe the process from ground zero when you\u2019re considering making a knife", "what does the process look like", "i\u2019ll try to share with you what i\u2019ve learned in having forged and completed over 24,000 blades in my career", "a lot of the things that i\u2019ve realized have come about at certain times of my experience", "i\u2019m sure by the time i\u2019ve made 50,000, i might have a slightly different outlook altogether", "one of the primary differences between a western blade and a japanese high-performance blade is the use of laminates", "most western blades are homogenous in construction, meaning they\u2019re either all carbon steel from the spine all the way down to the cutting edge of the blade, or they\u2019re all stainless steel", "but throughout, they\u2019re the same kind of steel", "they\u2019re all manufactured from one solid billet of homogenous steel", "in contrast, the japanese blades are almost always a combination of two or more different kinds of steel", "you\u2019ve heard the expression, \u201chave your cake and eat it too,\u201d well if you combine a hard and a soft steel together in the same package or in the same blade, the hard steel can be really hard and contribute to superior cutting performance", "the soft steel can be left soft so that it\u2019s super tough, shock absorbing, avoiding breakage, and also easy to sharpen", "it\u2019s very difficult to get the qualities of soft steel and hard steel out of a homogenous blade, because it\u2019s all the same", "right away, we\u2019re starting with a different blade construction, and that\u2019s a laminate", "the most common blade construction in japanese cutlery is a three-layer blade construction, often referred to as a san mai, which means three-layer or three-sheet-style construction, where the center of the laminate is the hard steel that\u2019s going to become the sharpened cutting edge like the lead in a pencil", "the outer laminates are softer, either mild steel or a soft stainless", "they strengthen, toughen, cushion, and make the blade easy to sharpen and very much act like the wood on the outside of the lead inside of the pencil; they support it", "that\u2019s the most common", "there\u2019s two-layer construction", "then there\u2019s sword construction, where the hard steel wraps around a soft center core and then you can have damascus-style construction where you\u2019ve got hundreds of different layers all in different kind of constructs for either visual effect or metallurgical effect", "but the laminated blade does give you the best of both worlds", "it does allow you to have your cake and eat it too because you can have a really high rockwell, a hardness core that means it can take a razor-sharp edge and hold that edge for a long time, but avoid the pitfall of being brittle because the outer, softer laminates support it and keep the whole blade from fracturing", "right", "and how does one make such a knife", "what are the steps involved", "you achieve a laminated blade through a process called forge welding", "everyone knows if you hear the word \u201cwelding,\u201d you think of a mig or a tig or an inner-gas welder and a big spark and bright light", "but literally, there\u2019s lots of different types of welding", "there\u2019s ultrasound welding, there\u2019s welding with explosives, welding through friction and so on", "but forge welding is the oldest form of welding known to mankind", "that\u2019s when you take two metals that have similar temperature ranges and you heat them up until the molecules on the surface of each metal start to liquify, then you press the two together and if you\u2019re at the right temperature and you have clean surfaces, you can actually get the molecules from each surface of the metal to intermingle and fuse together", "in layman\u2019s terms, it\u2019s like taking two candles that are cold and hard", "you would heat up each end over a flame source until the end of the candle just started liquify", "then if you touch the ends of both candles together at the same time, in an ideal situation, you would end up with one big long candle once it cooled down because the wax would intermingle and mix", "fusing is different than melting the metals together, where you would make the two dissimilar metals molten and mix them up in a pot like you would stir chocolate milk powder into a glass of chocolate milk", "it\u2019s not that kind of mixing", "it\u2019s fusing them together in such a way that each unique layer still maintains it\u2019s original characteristics", "that\u2019s done in a forge", "a forge is a source of heat", "we have gas forges", "we have electric forges", "then we have what i use, which is a solid fuel forge", "what does solid fuel mean", "i burn up coke in my forge", "spoonfuls at a time", "what is coke", "are we talking coca-cola", "cocaine", "something else", "i just purchased four tons of coke the other day", "coke is \u2013 all joking aside \u2013 it\u2019s coal as they dig it up from the ground and it\u2019s heated once in the absence of oxygen", "it drives off all the impurities, namely phosphorous and sulfur, which are combustible gases that are very undesirable when it comes to heating steel to make knives", "coke is to coal what charcoal is to wood", "i see", "got it", "it\u2019s just purified carbon because all of the volatile gases have been driven off", "how is that spelled", "c-o-k-e", "oh, it is", "i was going to say, a couple of tons of coke \u2013 unless you have a very sophisticated drug-smuggling operation and a huge budget, it\u2019s probably something else", "so that is solid fuel", "that\u2019s right", "that\u2019s solid fuel forge", "so you\u2019re fusing these different layers together and maintaining the integrity in the sense that the separation of these layers, so you can design a knife that allows you to have your cake and eat it too", "what happens after that", "once you\u2019ve successfully forge welded your different layers of steel together, then you need to forge that billet, which is what it\u2019s called, into a blade shape", "some blades are wide and short and some are narrow and long, like in the case of a slicing knife", "some are thicker and some are thinner", "you can set out from your billet to forge any kind of blade you desire, providing you\u2019ve got enough material to make the blade you\u2019re setting out to make", "it involves heating the steel to a plastic state, which is usually around 800\u00b0 c", "because i was in japan and i was in canada, for me, everything is celsius", "i don\u2019t translate to fahrenheit very well, but i think it\u2019s something like 1350\u00b0 f", "when you\u2019re at a campfire and you see the orange coals down at the very bottom and they\u2019re not bright yellow, they\u2019re just a really bright orange color, that\u2019s about 800\u00b0\u00a0c and that\u2019s the color we want the steel to be when we start hammering it", "it\u2019s very pliable in that state", "you don\u2019t want to heat the steel hotter than that because you can literally burn the steel and ruin it", "you start hammering it", "if you have enough force with the hammer, you can coax the steel into different shapes", "obviously, blacksmiths have been doing that for millennia", "the difference is as a new bladesmith, one is overly focused on getting the right shape", "somewhere along the line, somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 blades, i realized that something more important was happening when i was forging the steel", "that was grain refinement", "as it turns out, if you heat your steel, your laminate, your billet of steel to that 800\u00b0 and then hammer the steel as it\u2019s cooling, you\u2019re actually refining the grain in this steel, which can result in a higher performing blade", "so even if you start out making two different blades even out of the same steel, how you heat the steel and how you hammer it and how sequentially you heat the steel will result in two entirely different quality of blades", "when you say grain, i\u2019m thinking of cutting against the grain or with the grain in say, cutting steak", "is it a direction of fibers in the steel itself", "what\u2019s the best way to think of refining grain", "if you\u2019ve ever fractured a piece of metal and looked at it, it\u2019s quite likely, even if it was aluminum or whatever, you look at the metal fractured surface and it looks like little grains of sand", "it looks granular", "sometimes it looks finely granular and you have to look very closely to discern different bumps in the fractured surface", "sometimes, it\u2019s very coarse", "basically, steel has grain which you can think of like marbles or bbs or grains of sand", "the finer they are and more evenly dispersed they are throughout the steel matrix or throughout the billet, the finer of a cutting implement will result", "the reason is that it\u2019s not the grains themselves that make steel strong, but the grain boundary", "where one grain touches another grain, there\u2019s something about that boundary complexity that increases the strength of steel", "the finer grain you can achieve in steel, the more grain boundary that results, and therefore a better end product", "you have, as you said, forged or produced somewhere along the line of 24,000 blades", "you spent 18 years in japan", "and yet, this is another part of your story or life that really grabbed my attention, you hold classes or workshops where people can come in and over the course of a week or a few days, walk away with a blade", "is that fair to say", "yeah", "i\u2019ve been doing that for five or six years now", "after putting in the amount of time to master your craft that you\u2019ve put in, what does the curriculum look like for a two or three-day class", "because you\u2019ve clearly put so much thought into this", "how do you teach this", "i always think about sequencing", "when you\u2019re learning a language, how you provide positive feedback but balance that with some kind of logical progression that is graspable", "what does such a class look like when you\u2019re teaching it", "the way we\u2019ve talked about 24,000 blades in 18 years, it sounds daunting and impossible to learn anything important in such a short timeframe as one week", "but fortunately, that\u2019s not true", "bladesmithing is not rocket science", "a lot of the mystique and lore of bladesmithing is simply because a lot of the obvious things about blades are hidden in plain sight and not often revealed and not often taught", "what i mean by that, let me quantity that, the main skill that i teach or confer in a short amount of time is i teach students how to use their eyes and how to see what\u2019s actually there", "obviously, we were talking earlier about grain and steel and so on", "we don\u2019t actually get out microscopes and look at that", "i teach them to see if blades are straight", "i can teach them to see if the blades have the profiles that they\u2019re looking for as they grind the blades", "i teach them to pinpoint troubles areas and then pinpoint the remedy for that", "like with grinders or a hammer or a file or whatnot", "i teach them through repetition", "i teach them to start to rely upon their eyes and to trust their eyes so that when they actually see something, they know what they\u2019re really looking at", "in terms of the metallurgy after we forge, and anneal, and quench, and temper blades and then grind them, i teach them simple things like how to test to see if the edge of the blade or if the whole blade actually hardened by cutting into other metal objects", "i teach them to do a rudimentary test to see if they\u2019ve got fine grain and if they quenched it at the right temperature and tempered it properly, when if they push a thin edge against an object like a brass rod, they should be able to see the edge flex and then when the pressure\u2019s removed, they should see that flexed portion spring back to a true edge again", "last but not lease, part of what we do is we place a lot of emphasis on hand sharpening of the knives on sharpening stones", "i teach them to pay attention to how the blade that they forged and heat treated, how it feels on the stone when they\u2019re sharpening it", "between a sense of touch and feel and using one\u2019s eyesight, it\u2019s actually a remarkable testament to the human condition to report just how much the average student can learn in the space of a week", "it\u2019s really remarkable", "if you were looking back at the students you\u2019ve taught, the people you\u2019ve encountered in the process of teaching and making knives certainly, if you were in charge of talent scouting \u2013 let\u2019s just treat it as the oakland athletics moneyball type of approach", "your job is to put together, it\u2019s slightly different, but you\u2019re trying to put together a team of people who have the potential be great bladesmiths", "what are the attributes that you\u2019re looking for to put together that team", "how would you try to spot the potential for someone who can be great at this", "what are the patterns you\u2019ve noticed or things you\u2019ve observed", "well, that\u2019s a very timely question, tim", "because we actually are actively growing carter cutlery and as we spent the last week hiring our tenth employee", "so a very timely question", "i look for two very specific things", "i look for aptitude and attitude", "the aptitude is somebody\u2019s ability to acquire new skills or to use the skills that they already have", "i look for attitude, which is a willingness to learn; a willingness to be humble; a willingness to stick to something once you\u2019ve decided that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do, so sticktoitiveness; and a willingness to work in a team environment", "those two qualities specifically are what i\u2019m looking for", "on the aptitude side of things, the ability to learn, the ability to be humble, the ability to stick, the sticktoitiveness, and the teamwork, how do you test for that", "in other words, how do you determine if someone has that or not", "the attitude", "yes, exactly", "any of those things", "in other words, if you\u2019re looking at it as a hiring process, so some people use interviews, some people use test projects for hiring for many different skills", "how do you determine if someone has the capacity to learn, the ability to be humble, stick to something, and work in a team", "unfortunately, i found that the only accurate way to make that assessment is to put the candidate in the actual work environment", "because two things can happen: people who claim to have great aptitude and attitude will reveal that they actually aren\u2019t that equipped for that position", "and conversely, people who think they might be, once they get into that environment and are encouraged in the right way, and surrounded by the right kind of people, can actually develop a healthier mindset better than they even came into the interview with", "that can be nurtured", "i think the best solution is to get the applicant in the working environment and then just work with them as closely as possible and encourage them in every way you can and be in constant communication with them", "i think usually within a week or two, you have a much better idea than simply an interview or viewing a portfolio or reading a resume alone can provide", "for sure", "and for those people listening who would like to explore this aspect of business, meaning hiring or even more specifically, auditioning people, matt mullenweg, who\u2019s been on the podcast, ceo of automattic, thought of as the lead developer of wordpress, has a very fascinating process for auditioning people, whether they are the entry-level customer support or a cfo", "the process is remarkably similar", "that\u2019s worth digging into", "i have a couple of questions that are really not organized by any particular theme", "i\u2019m just curious to know the answer", "the first is, in many knives that are supposedly japanese style that you can buy easily in the west, you find these dimples on the sides of the knives", "sometimes they\u2019re called santoku, sometimes they\u2019re called something else", "what are the functions of those dimples", "do they matter", "are they done well", "how should someone think about those if they really have no familiarity with knives", "well, i think what you might be referring to are kind of like a hammered texture into the upper surface of the blade", "what you might be referring to is what\u2019s called a granton edge, where the steel is actually scalloped out", "that\u2019s right", "i looks like, i think it\u2019s concave, i think i\u2019m getting this right, say ellipse or semi-circular carve out", "yeah, and henckels is well known for that", "they put out a kind of a japanese-style santoku-shaped blade that has a granton edge where right behind the primary cutting edge of the blade are these scalloped out depressions in the blade", "and the concept is that when you\u2019re cutting something that has a high moisture content like cucumbers or tomatoes or whatnot, rather than sticking to the blade and then being pushed up by subsequent slides to the top of the spine of the blade and then being bopped off the blade and rolling off the table and onto the floor, the idea is as you\u2019re cutting, the cut material will separate more easily from the secondary edge of the blade", "in concept, it can work", "i don\u2019t like it for several reasons", "first of all, if you have a blade that is thick enough behind the cutting edge to grind in scalloped indentations, for me that means the blade is simply too thick", "because the thicker the blade, the more resistance there is to push the blade through things", "many people need to understand that when we think of the words \u201csharp\u201d and \u201cblade,\u201d there\u2019s actually two phenomena: there\u2019s the primary edge, which is the part of the blade that everyone thinks of when we think of sharp that initiates the cut", "it\u2019s the part that goes into your finger first, before you see the blood", "then there\u2019s the secondary edge, which is the geometry of steel behind the primary edge", "the secondary edge is what becomes consequential when you\u2019re actually trying to push the blade through things, whether it\u2019s an acorn squash or a big, thick rubber stall mat that you might be standing on in your shop to save wear and tear on your feet or thick shoe leather", "if you try to push a blade through things, then what\u2019s going on in the secondary edge is absolutely important", "as much, if not more important, than the sharpness of the primary edge", "in cooking, we often need to push the blade all the way through things, whether it\u2019s cucumber, carrot, apple, potato or what not, so the thinner the blade, the better", "if you\u2019ve got a blade that\u2019s got granton edges on it, your blade is simply too thick", "one of the first things we do to remedy that when blades like that come into our shop for sharpening, refurbishment or repair is we grind the blade down by a certain percentage and remove some of those granton edges", "but the resulting thinness of the blade greatly enhances the cutting performance", "the other thing i don\u2019t like about those is they\u2019re not necessarily sanitary", "that\u2019s an area where bacteria and food particles can hide out in", "in an ideal world, a blade for culinary use is very clean on both the primary and secondary surfaces", "once you\u2019re finished using it, you simply put it in a cloth and with one swipe, you can get the blade completely clean", "so it\u2019s very low effort to keep it clean and sanitary", "makes perfect sense", "having spent so much time in japan, i would love to know if you have any favorite japanese sayings or mantras or anything that have really stuck with you", "i\u2019ll give people just a few examples of proverbs, for instance", "like [speaking japanese]", "there are some great ones", "in english, as well, of course, but you have [speaking japanese]", "even a monkey falls from a tree, which means it doesn\u2019t really matter how good you get, you can still fall on your face", "there are also other uses", "but then you have something that is actually pretty similar to tall poppy syndrome in say new zealand and australia, where people who stick out too much can be pulled down", "that\u2019s [speaking japanese]", "the stake that sticks up gets hammered down", "so if you stand up, you could be criticized", "one that is great that i really like also is [speaking japanese]", "not knowing is buddha, literally, but it\u2019s ignorance is bliss, basically", "or what you don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt you", "is there anything, are there any sayings in japanese or principles that have really stuck with you", "you know, tim, you and i are really two birds of a feather", "we share so many similarities and [speaking japanese] was one of my areas of \u2013 i was kind of considered a nerd during japanese language study at university of british columbia because i loved coming in with new [speaking japanese] to share with everybody", "one of my favorites is [speaking japanese]", "meaning when you feel yourself in a great hurry and a kind of a panic to get things done, that\u2019s the time to take a moment and regroup and take a deep breath and to really get your footing to make sure that you\u2019re making good decisions", "so i really like that one", "i like [speaking japanese]", "proceeding so cautiously as to tap with a stick every single stone in a stone bridge as you cross it, just to make sure the stone bridge isn\u2019t going to fall down when you\u2019re on it", "it\u2019s used often to illustrate an extreme level of caution and prudence", "and do you apply that in your life to knife making", "to other things", "where does come to mind for you most", "making business decisions", "i got it", "okay, right", "definitely measure twice, cut once", "exactly", "except this would be like measure ten times", "right", "sometimes it\u2019s used to sarcastically, for someone who\u2019s so cautious that they become petrified from doing anything", "i also like [speaking japanese]", "it\u2019s \u2013 and this is a special one in the cutlery industry, which is don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t be in a rush, but get the job done", "what was the first one that you mentioned", "when you \u2013 [speaking japanese]", "[speaking japanese]", "that\u2019s such a good one", "yeah, when you feel rushed, when you feel like you have to get everything done this instant, that is a great time to hit pause", "and lastly, sometimes when we\u2019re in the blade shop and just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all and done it all and suffered every single setback that there ever could be in the blade shop, sometimes we become [speaking japanese]", "which is a different version of your [speaking japanese]", "meaning that anybody can fall", "and [speaking japanese] is when you become kind of bereft by some kind of unexpected setback, such as being run off by your wife or something like that", "so when something in the shop goes awry in such a way as no one ever saw it coming, we can be the [speaking japanese]", "i love it", "well, i know that we are coming up on time shortly, so i\u2019m not going to ask too many more questions", "we could talk for days and days and days, i am sure", "so maybe we\u2019ll do a round 2 at some point", "maybe we\u2019ll actually get to talking about bladesmithing and knives", "well, yeah, i think that the people who are with us at this point in this conversation are already converted and fascinated", "they are more interested in knives now than they were when they turned this on", "i think we could talk for days about many different aspects of knife making and the shared dna that we have through japan", "let me ask just a handful more", "i\u2019m already happy with the conversation", "i\u2019ll use this to round it out", "what books have you gifted the most to other people or re-read the most yourself", "as a child, i was fascinated with the book ivanhoe", "i love the story of knights and their heroism and altruism and fighting for a great cause", "i kind of have a romantic notion of right and wrong and good and evil", "but in terms of the book i\u2019ve given away the most, of course that would be bladesmithing with murray carter, of course the book that i first authored", "it was the first of three books that i\u2019ve authored", "it\u2019s a great instructional book on bladesmithing techniques in general, but more specifically the application of traditional japanese bladesmithing techniques", "besides your own books, which i also recommend people check out, for sure, any others that you\u2019ve gifted to people that come to mind", "i would say i\u2019m probably delinquent in the fact that i\u2019ve not given many books as presents in my lifetime", "thank you for the idea", "i now have next year\u2019s christmas presents figured out", "all right, well let\u2019s look at it differently", "when you gift, are there any items that you routinely gift to people", "if the answer is knives, what is your go-to gift knife", "what type of knife", "what characterizes it", "probably the most noteworthy is the fact that i wear a knife daily, usually in the form of a neck knife", "it\u2019s the kind of knife that we hang from our neck, inverted upside down, very securely, in a thermoplastic sheath called kydex", "it\u2019s a really handy blade to have", "it\u2019s the alternative to a folding knife in the pocket", "there\u2019s no mechanism to break, it\u2019s easy to sharpen, easy to maintain and very strong for its size, and has excellent cutting potential", "i\u2019ve been carrying neck knives for my whole career as a bladesmith", "i typically will meet some person who inspires me in some way", "they might be a young child, it might be the son of a good friend", "it might a housewife who i think could use some protection while walking in the park", "but i have given more knives off of my own neck than i\u2019ve used for several weeks or months or years, that i know are really good high-performing, great cutting knives", "i gifted a lot of those away", "that\u2019s a great answer", "i love \u2013 neck knives", "this is also something that i\u2019ve been somewhat obsessed with in the last few weeks", "that\u2019s a to-be-continued", "so when are you going to come and take a class", "you know what", "when we hit stop on this recording, i want to talk to you about that because it\u2019s something i would like to do asap, ideally before the time that this episode comes out, or at least get a reservation in", "the last two questions: this is one, if you had a gigantic billboard \u2013 this is more of a metaphorical question, but you could put a short message on that billboard to get it out to millions of people, that is non-commercial, what would that or what might that message be", "well, i could put something clich\u00e9 on there like \u201cdon\u2019t give up.\u201d i could put \u201cstick to the plan.\u201d i had written on my walls over in my japanese shop, \u201cstick to the plan,\u201d and the other one under that was \u201cconcentrate on the task at hand.\u201d it\u2019s so easy to get distracted from new stimuli that focusing and concentrating on the task at hand is often, even though it\u2019s a simple concept, it\u2019s difficult to execute", "those are some truisms or sayings that i live by", "what does stick to the plan mean to you most often", "why is that one of the two that you chose", "well, in quiet moments, we all sit down, either alone or with loved ones or people we trust and we plan", "humans plan", "they say at first of these three things that probably need to happen, we should do this first, and then this second, and then lastly we\u2019ll achieve this", "and as is so common in life, people sabotage their own plans", "they get to a certain part of the plan and it becomes monotonous or tedious or difficult or challenging", "all of a sudden, instead of sticking with the plan and seeing it through to completion, they think, what i need is a new plan", "so you have people who habitually, chronically are in the process of making new plans and never actually execute a single one of their existing plans", "is that something that you\u2019ve struggled with", "or is that \u2013 it sounds you have that pretty well handled", "so i\u2019m wondering is it more of a reminder for your employees", "how have you used that reminder in your life or for other people", "you\u2019re right", "i\u2019ve been lucky to have stuck to most of my plans and achieved the goals i\u2019ve set out for myself because i\u2019ve constantly reminded myself to stick to the plan", "good answer", "very good answer", "do you have any parting \u2013 and i\u2019m also going to ask you before we wrap up where people can find out more about you and so on", "i\u2019ll put those links in the show notes for everyone", "any parting comments, requests, thoughts for the people who are listening to this", "well, i\u2019d like to thank everybody for listening", "of course, they can find out more about our knives at cartercutlery.com", "we do strive to make the finest knives in the world", "high-performance blades that are also very easy to maintain", "we\u2019ve successfully encouraged and mentored tens of thousands of people to learn the very easily attainable skill of sharpening knives", "we\u2019ve kind of revitalized that essential skill and given a lot of people the great feeling of a mastery and satisfactory over their cutlery in being able to maintain it and sharpen it and use it to their heart\u2019s content", "could you give \u2013 just with that teaser \u2013 could you name one thing you wish more people did related to knife sharpening or one thing you wish people would stop doing", "i\u2019ll give a little freebie out there for everybody", "that is when they get a new piece of cutlery, especially one for the kitchen, if they will just keep that cutting edge from touching anything other than food \u2013 meaning don\u2019t drop it in your kitchen sink, don\u2019t let it touch other plates and pans", "don\u2019t let it touch the other silverware in the drawer", "that will preserve the cutting edge, the primary edge of that knife, far longer than they ever thought possible", "it\u2019s the clanging around of the knives, the misplacement of the knives in the kitchen that really dulls them", "that\u2019s a little freebie for everybody", "so they shouldn\u2019t use their kitchen knives for opening boxes from amazon, in other words", "they can do that after they master sharpening", "then i don\u2019t care what they use their knife for because it\u2019s only a couple of minutes before they can refresh both primary and secondary edges of their knives", "that\u2019s freedom", "that\u2019s the real freedom", "[inaudible]", "that is the freedom, when you can maintain and master your own tools", "everybody listening, you can also find carter cutlery on facebook", "facebook.com/cartercutlery", "instagram \u2013 fantastic instagram \u2013 also cartercutlery", "i will put all links to everything we\u2019ve discussed in the show notes, as usual so everybody listening can find all of that, as well as more resources and so on, at tim.blog/podcast for this episode and every other episode", "carter \u2013 i always want to call you carter", "i have a good friend named carter", "murray, thank you so much for taking the time", "there\u2019s an expression in japanese which i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard before, which is [speaking japanese]", "so when you do something and you never want to do it again, that\u2019s [speaking japanese]", "i have the exact opposite feeling with this conversation", "i hope we have many, many more", "thank you for taking the time4", "[speaking japanese]", "exactly", "[speaking japanese]", "and as some of my japanese friends said to me with this bewildered face in high school, they would say [speaking japanese]", "so i have that feeling with you, which is that you are secretly partly japanese, which i mean as the highest compliment", "to be continued", "thank you again", "to everybody listening, as always, thank you and continue to do experiments, be nice, and be safe"]}
