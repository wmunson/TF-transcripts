This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show where it is, typically, my job to deconstruct world class performers of all different types, whether they comes from the world of chess, military, business, entertainment, sports, or otherwise. This time around, I\u2019m doing an experiment. And I want you to support a friend of mine. And there\u2019s not much involved. You just have to listen. Cal Fussman has been on this podcast, @calfussman on Twitter. He is a New York Times bestselling author and was the writer at large for Esquire Magazine where he was best known for being a primary writer of the what I learned featured. What does this mean? He has conducted interviews with icons who have shaped the last 50 to 100 years of world history. Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, the list goes on and on and on. He did his first long form interview as the interviewee on this podcast. I interviewed him twice. He is an incredible storyteller. And I have been trying to get Cal to do his own podcast since we first did that probably a year and a half or two years ago. So, this is what we did for this episode. I said, \u201cCal, let me take the pressure off. Rather than over thinking the podcast, why don\u2019t you interview a friend of yours who I would love to have on the podcast anyway, Larry King?\u201d All right. So, this episode is Cal Fussman interviewing his friend, Larry King. And if you like it, I would love for you to tell Cal. You can just hit him on Twitter @calfussman or on his website, calfussman.com. But hit him on Twitter and let him know what you think. Encourage him to do a podcast. My first podcast was a hell of a lot rougher than this one that he did with Larry. So, Larry King, if you don\u2019t know who he is is on Twitter @kingsthings or the website you can check out is aura.tv/larrykingnow. He has been dubbed \u201cthe most remarkable talk show host on TV ever\u201d by TV Guide and master of the mic by Time magazine. He has done more than 50,000, that\u2019s right, I think I\u2019ve done a lot with 260 or 270 guest interviews, he\u2019s done 50,000 interviews throughout his half century in broadcasting, including exclusive sit downs with every US president since Gerald Ford. Larry King Live debuted on CNN in 1985 and ran for 25 years. He\u2019s been described as the Muhammad Ali of the broadcast interview. And Larry has been inducted into five of the nation\u2019s leading broadcasting halls of fame and is the recipient of the Allen H. Neuharth Award for Excellence in Journalism, an Emmy, the George Foster Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting, 10 Cable Ace Awards, it goes on and on. He is also the author of several books, including his autobio, My Remarkable Journey. And I mentioned the link just a bit earlier. But he is, currently, the host of Larry King Now, which is produced on Aura TV. And you can find that at aura.tv/larrykingnow. So, without further ado, here is the conversation between Cal Fussman and Larry King. And if you think Cal should do his own podcast, then, tell him to not over think it and to get started. And you can hit him up on Twitter @calfussman. And you can also check out his website at calfussman.com. So, here you go. Enjoy Cal Fussman with Larry King. Cal Fussman: All right. Here we go. This is Cal Fussman on his first podcast. Larry King: The Fussman Factor. Cal Fussman: Can you believe that, Larry? Larry King: You should name this the Fussman Factor. I\u2019ll bet no one has a podcast with a factor because Bill O\u2019Reilly is out of work. Cal Fussman: As you can tell, my first guest is none other than Larry King. Larry King: In person. Cal Fussman: Sixty years. Larry King: Sixty years on the air. Could you believe it, Cal Fussman? Cal Fussman: That I can believe, 25 on CNN now or at dot TV. Larry King: In the sixth year now already. Cal Fussman: Interviewed more than, what, 60,000 people? Larry King: That\u2019s the best estimate in almost 61 years. It could be right because I worked radio and did five hours of radio a night, many times, having multiple guests. And that was five nights a week, five hours of television every week. Yeah, a lot. Radio, television, race track interviews. I did afternoon shows, remotes, 60,000 is about right. I had a full career of this. Cal Fussman: So, this is my first time behind the mic. Thank you, Tim Ferriss, for giving me the opportunity to guest host the podcast. Larry King: Oh, this is not your podcast. Cal Fussman: Well, it\u2019s my podcast, but Tim is being kind enough to set it off into the atmosphere. Larry King: So, this is kind of a Ferriss Wheel. Cal Fussman: Oh, man. Lar. Larry King: I love that. He wheeled it over to Fussman. Okay, I get it. Cal Fussman: Okay. This is my first. Let\u2019s immediately talk about your first time behind the mic. Larry King: There\u2019s a little back story. I was in love with radio. As a kid, even I remember 5 or 6 years old, I would listen to the radio, imitate radio announcers. There would be shows like a tale well calculated to keep you in suspense. And I would, at 5 years old, run into the bathroom and, a tale well calculated, the Shadow knows. And I was fascinated. My father died when I was 9.5. And that threw a roadblock into a lot of things. I couldn\u2019t go to college. I had to help support my mother. But, when I was a teenager, I\u2019d go into Manhattan, we called it the city. We lived in Brooklyn, and we called Manhattan they said going to the city. I would visit radio shows that had studio audiences. And I would watch announcers read off scripts and drop the paper down, look at microphones. And I said I want to do that. I really want to do that. I had a bunch of odd jobs after high school, one of which was for the Associated Merchandizing Corporation whose offices were at 1440 Broadway on the third floor. On the 20th floor was WOR Radio. Later, when I had a nationally syndicated show, WOR was my New York affiliate. But I would take the elevator up to the 20th floor, and there were elevator operators then. And I would say to the elevator operator, \u201cLobby please,\u201d pretending I was an announcer. I fantasized I was an announcer. I worked for United Parcel Service. I worked for Hearn\u2019s Department Store. And then, I \u2013 Cal Fussman: So, you knew this was your destiny? Larry King: Yeah. Well, I knew it was my destiny. I didn\u2019t know where I would start. I\u2019m 22 years old. My mother is now working. I had to help support her. My brother is in college. And I\u2019m walking down the street, and a friend, I don\u2019t know who it was even, introduced me to a guy named James Seramos who was director of announcers at CBS. And I said to him, \u201cI would love to be a radio announcer. What advice do you give me?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, are you single?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He said, \u201cTry Miami. It\u2019s a big market, a lot of stations, no union. And they might have older people on the way out and younger people on the way up. And it might be a shot.\u201d So, my uncle, my mother\u2019s sister had passed away, and my uncle who owned a tuxedo store in New York had retired down to Miami Beach. He had an apartment. And he said I could stay with him because I had no money. And I took a train down to Miami. And I think I had $11.00 or $12.00 in my pocket. And I went to stay with him. I arrived at the train station. The first thing I saw was a water fountain that said \u201cColored\u201d and \u201cWhite\u201d, two water fountains. I drank out of the colored fountain. I had never seen a thing like that growing up in New York. Couldn\u2019t believe it. I get on a bus to go over to Miami Beach. I\u2019m sitting in the back. The bus driver pulls over and asks me to please move up to the front. The back is for negroes, and the front is for whites. First day in Miami. So, I said, \u201cMy father is negro. I prefer to sit in the back.\u201d I mean, it just annoyed me so much. Anyway, I went over, and I went around the radio stations. And they wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I was 22 years old. Cal Fussman: So, you\u2019re just knocking on doors? Larry King: Yeah. No experience. Do you have any jobs open? I went to WIOD was one of the first stations I went to where I later worked for 19 years. So, I went to this small station on Miami Beach, WAHR, went in, very small station. General manager was Marshal Simmons, a nice guy. And he said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a voice test.\u201d And he put me into a little studio with a microphone like this. And he gave me a news analysis to read. And that\u2019s the first time I ever \u2013 and I read it. And he said, \u201cWell, you have a nice voice. And we have a lot of change over here. We\u2019re very small. We don\u2019t pay a lot. If you want to hang around and watch the announcers work and watch how they get the news, if an opening happens, we\u2019ll give you a shot.\u201d So, I hung around for maybe three or four weeks. I stayed there day and night. I watched the announcers. I watched them rip and read. I would go out with Sunny Hirsch when he did sports interviews. I just was taking it all in. And one day, a Friday, Marshal Simmons, the general manager, called me, and he says, \u201cWell, Tom Bayer is leaving.\u201d Tom Bayer was an unusual situation. He made $55.00 a week, and his alimony was $60.00 a week. He figured out once that he could not make it on this. He used to live off coconuts, coconuts from trees. So, he says, \u201cYou start Monday morning. You\u2019re on from 9:00 to 12:00 in the morning, and in the afternoon, you\u2019ll do news and sports.\u201d Cal Fussman: So, you got your whole weekend to prepare for this now. Larry King: I went crazy. The whole weekend I had. I went back home. I came back to the radio station Saturday morning, started picking out the music I\u2019m going to play, hung around there all Saturday. Sunday practiced, went into the little studio, good morning, good morning. This record, Les Elgart, Swinging Down the Lane. I\u2019m so excited. Now, it\u2019s Monday morning, May 1, 1957. I get there like 6:00. I go on at 9:00. My uncle hugs me and wishes me the best. It was a warm, muggy, sunny, Miami Beach morning, 840 First Street right opposite the police station. I would visit there last year, by the way. It\u2019s another station now. But, anyway, I walk in. There\u2019s a secretary that comes in at about 8:00. I say hello to the all night guy, stack up my records, I\u2019m ready to play. And then, Marshal Simmons says, \u201cCome into my office,\u201d at like 8:45. And I go in. And he goes, \u201cWell, this is your first day on the air. The best of luck to you.\u201d And I said, \u201cThank you.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat name are you going to use?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d And he goes, \u201cWell, Larry Zeiger,\u201d that was my name, \u201cain\u2019t going to work.\u201d Now, it would work. Now, any name would go. Engelbert Humperdinck, any name would go. So, he says, \u201cZeiger won\u2019t work. It\u2019s a little too ethnic, and people won\u2019t know how to spell it. And we got to change your name.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m going on the air in 12 minutes.\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and he had the Miami Herald open, and I would later write a column for them. All of these things are like miracles. And there was an ad for King\u2019s Wholesale Liquors on Washington Avenue. Cal Fussman: So, he looks down at that ad \u2013 Larry King: He looked, and he said, \u201cHow about Larry King?\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay, sounds good.\u201d A year later, we legally changed, and it\u2019s legally changed in AFTRA. So, if you\u2019re a broadcaster today at an AFTRA station, even if your name is Larry King, you can\u2019t use Larry King because it\u2019s a branded name. yeah, it\u2019s true. And then, it becomes where you become famous, no one can ever use it. No one could be Arthur Godfrey or Jackie Gleason, even if your name is Jackie Gleason. If you get a television show, you can\u2019t be Jackie Gleason on an AFTRA station. Anyway, so, now, I got a new name. Now, I go in. I\u2019m about to go on the air. At 9:00, I start the record [humming and singing]. I lower the record, put on the microphone, and nothing comes out. Cal Fussman: Nothing comes out of your mouth? Larry King: Nothing. I bring the record back up, lower it down, bring it back up, lower it down, and I am panicked. I am sweating. I\u2019m looking at the clock. And I literally said to myself I can\u2019t do it. I can do a lot of things, but I\u2019m nervous, and my whole career is done. And Marshal Simmons, God rest him, kicked open the door to the control room and said, \u201cThis is a communications business, damn it, communication.\u201d He closed the door. I turned down the record, put the mic on and said, \u201cGood morning. My name is Larry King. And that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said that because I\u2019ve just been given this name.\u201d \u201cAnd let me tell you, this is my first day ever on the air. And all of my life, I dreamed of this. When I was 5 years old, I would imitate announcers.\u201d The story I just told you, I told the radio audience that day. My father died, I had to \u2013 and I\u2019m nervous. I was very nervous here. So, please bear with me. I played the record and was never nervous again. And later in life, that story, I would tell it to Arthur Godfrey, Jackie Gleason, and others. And they said, \u201cWell, you learned the secret of this business, which is there\u2019s no secret. Be yourself.\u201d So, what I did that day, I wasn\u2019t brilliant, I wasn\u2019t conceiving this, carried through me for 60 years, which is be yourself. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask a question. Don\u2019t be afraid to sound stupid. Cal Fussman: What did that teach you about honesty? Larry King: And not just honesty. Yeah, it teaches you a lot about being open and honest on the air. But, of course, what you do when you do that is you bring the audience into your circumstance. And when you do that, if they like you, you win them. If they don\u2019t like you, they\u2019re not going to like you anyway. You can\u2019t make them like you. I asked Edward Bennett Williams, the great criminal defense lawyer, once what\u2019s the No. 1 role of a criminal defense lawyer. And he said, \u201cPut one juror in my client\u2019s shoes.\u201d Cal Fussman: How would that play out? Larry King: If you can put one client in your client\u2019s shoes, he\u2019ll never vote guilty because he would say I would have done that. All right. So, what I did that day was put the audience in my shoes. And I recommend that. I\u2019ve done a book, How to Talk to Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere. I do a course. If you\u2019re going to be \u2013 your first public speech. You\u2019re scared. Get up and tell them you\u2019re scared. They would understand because they\u2019d be scared, too. Bring them into your situation. I was on the air when we had the earthquake here. I was on television, CNN, there were cameras bouncing around. I\u2019m broadcasting the earthquake. We\u2019re having an earthquake. Desks are flying. I\u2019m over there, \u201cI hope we\u2019re still on. If we\u2019re still on,\u201d you know what I mean? I was in the station alone during a hurricane. And I broadcasted the hurricane. For example, we were out of money. It was a cigarette machine and a candy machine. It was just me and the engineer in the station alone. No one could get there. I broke the machine on the air. Cal Fussman: They heard you breaking into the machine? Larry King: Yeah. Of course, I told them my situation. I got no cigarettes, and I got no food. I said, \u201cYou want to hear what a hurricane sounds like?\u201d We were the only station in the city, WIOD, with a generator. An emergency generator, we were the only thing on the air. You had to tune to us. So, I would go outside, lean the microphone out the window, and say, \u201cHere\u2019s what it sounds like.\u201d And I broadcast the hurricane. I just ate it up, yeah. Cal Fussman: This is the power of storytelling what you\u2019re talking about. Larry King: Yeah. Well, the power is I was always good at that. When I was a kid, they called me Zeke like short for Larry Zeiger. I was Zeke the Creek the Mouthpiece because I would, as Herby said, I would go to a two hour baseball game and come back and tell the guys about it and take two hours. In other words, I was descriptive. I always had the ability. I thought I would be a baseball announcer. That was my goal to be a sports announcer because I knew I could describe things well in front of me. Cal Fussman: Do you think that\u2019s a learned skill?\u00a0Or is that something that you just had inside of you? Larry King: I have no idea. I think you can teach certain things. You can\u2019t teach a good voice. I never had a voice lesson. I had laryngitis maybe once in the 60 years. I\u2019ve worked sick. When I had a heart attack, I was only off the air 10 days. I think one of the reasons for my longevity is the love of what I do. In other words, I may have an unhappy day at home. Things may not go right. I can\u2019t control \u2013 but when that light goes on, I control my environment. And then, how many people get to control their environment? So, when I hosted a radio show every night or television show every day or wrote a column, I controlled the question I would ask. I controlled my environment. Cal Fussman: It\u2019s interesting you say that because when I was thinking of doing the podcast, one of the things that scared me was, as a writer all of those years, I had control of the content. And I can do an interview, but, afterwards, I could piece it together to create the story in the best way possible. When you\u2019re doing an interview, certainly, that\u2019s live, you don\u2019t have that. Larry King: Correct. Cal Fussman: And so, I was going to have to give that up in order to do this. Larry King: You\u2019ve got to trust yourself. If you trust yourself, if you say to yourself \u2013 I have never said to myself, \u201cCan I ask this?\u201d I asked it. I never doubted myself. I don\u2019t have it in social circumstances. I don\u2019t have it in life. I don\u2019t have command of situations. But I trusted myself because I loved it. If you love communicating \u2013 a lot of writers aren\u2019t good broadcasters. Cal Fussman: A lot of them are terrible broadcasters. Larry King: Yeah. Because they\u2019re used to the comfort of the control on the typewriter, and they write it. If they only said to themselves, you know, I control this, too, I control it, you do control it. You\u2019re controlling this podcast right now. Not me, you. Cal Fussman: You know, the interesting thing, and maybe we can set this story up together because it reminded me of a story that Al Pacino tells that goes back to the Godfather. And I know you\u2019re good friends with him, and you\u2019ve heard about his arc through that beginning where, in the very beginning \u2013 Larry King: They were going to throw him off. Cal Fussman: Yeah. Do you want to tell a little about that, and then, I\u2019ll take it up to a point where he knew that the Godfather was going to be great. And it speaks to this, what we\u2019re talking about. Larry King: I\u2019m trying to remember. I got so many memories. Cal Fussman: All right. So, Al started, and he wasn\u2019t I think the top draft choice of the studio brass. Larry King: They wanted Robert Redford. Cal Fussman: They went along with it. And then, in the beginning, he was having a hard time grasping the part. And then, I believe it was, at a point where they were thinking of getting rid of him, and he did that famous scene where he goes into the bathroom to get the gun \u2013 Larry King: Get the gun to kill the cop. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s right. Larry King: And he throws the gun away, which was his idea, and he had the confidence. And they kept him. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s exactly it. And so, later on, the movie is proceeding, and they\u2019re doing the scene where the Godfather is going to be buried. And everybody works through the scene all day. At 6:00, everybody is going home. They\u2019re all walking away. And Al is about to leave. And he looks over, and he sees Francis Ford Coppola sitting on a grave stone weeping. And he walks over. And Francis is balling, and he says, \u201cFrancis, Francis, what\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d And Coppola says to him, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t give me another set up, meaning the brass wasn\u2019t going to pay for him to be able to shoot it again.\u201d And Al knew this guy is going to make a movie here because, if you care that much, and you have that kind of passion \u2013 Larry King: See, now, I didn\u2019t know that story. So, you are telling me that story. I knew the story of they were going to throw him off until he finished that scene. I know Brando, I talked to Brando a lot about it. I know one of the great scenes in the Godfather was totally adlibbed by Brando. And that\u2019s the scene right before he dies. He\u2019s sitting with Michael, his son, Al, and he\u2019s an old man now. And the grandson is playing. That\u2019s where he dies. He falls over playing with the grandson. He\u2019s sitting, and the waiter comes by, and the scene was, \u201cDo you want anything else,\u201d and they say, \u201cNo,\u201d they both say no, and he dismisses the waiter. And they keep talking. The waiter comes by for the scene. And the waiter says, \u201cDo you want anything else?\u201d And Brando, out of nowhere says, \u201cI\u2019ll have some wine.\u201d And he looks at Al Pacino, and he says, \u201cLately, I drink a lot of wine.\u201d Cal Fussman: Oh, man. Larry King: But it so fit. He\u2019s old now. He\u2019s not the mafia don he once was. \u201cLately, I drink a lot of wine.\u201d Cal Fussman: And the passion that that must come from, whether you\u2019re Al seeing Coppola on the grave stone or whether you are in that moment and these words just come out of you, it just seems central to what makes people great. Larry King: Well, you hit a great word, moment. And what I\u2019ve tried to do the whole career is be in the moment. So, I\u2019m always in the moment. That is, if I\u2019ve interviewed Al Pacino yesterday and Barack Obama tomorrow, but I\u2019m interviewing you today, I\u2019m totally into you today. I\u2019m not thinking about yesterday. And once the show is over, I never think about it. I don\u2019t listen to it. I know what I did. I don\u2019t have to listen to it. I don\u2019t have to watch it. Cal Fussman: Wow. That\u2019s what I need. Larry King: You won\u2019t have to listen to this podcast. You\u2019ll remember it. You know what you did. What are you going to listen for, unless you want to judge it? I don\u2019t. I never have, in my life, listened to myself. Once I\u2019ve done it because I know I\u2019ve been in the moment, I trust \u2013 see, the word is trust. I don\u2019t trust myself off the air. And that\u2019s weird. I made so many mistakes, been in debt, many marriages. Life didn\u2019t always work out for me. I tried to be a good father, sometimes was, sometimes wasn\u2019t. But on the air, no one ever called me in in my whole career to say what did you say yesterday. Cal Fussman: Well, there was one great story from the first station in Miami. You got to tell this. It\u2019s my favorite Larry King story. Larry King: It\u2019s a great story. It\u2019s a true story. But management never really reamed me out. But what happened was I had just started in radio. I was on the air two months. I\u2019m working 9:00 to 12:00. I\u2019m on in the afternoons, and I\u2019m loving every second of it. I can\u2019t wait to get there. I can\u2019t wait to be on. God, I loved it. And the general manager, Marshal Simmons, called me in and said, \u201cAl Fox, the all night guy, is sick tonight. Would you do the all night show?\u201d And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be here alone.\u201d Very small station. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an engineer at night. You just record the meter readings, play music and talk, and you\u2019re on from midnight to 6:00. And then, you\u2019ll hang around, and you\u2019ll be on again at 9:00 and then, get some rest.\u201d \u201cOh, sure.\u201d Now, I\u2019m alone in the station. I\u2019m playing records, and I\u2019m talking to people. We talk about the time and the weather and what\u2019s going on in the world because I\u2019m living every minute of this. And the phone rings, and I pick it up, and I say, \u201cWAHR.\u201d And this woman, I could tell you the truth, Cal, I can almost hear it now. This sexy woman voice says, \u201cI want you.\u201d Remember, I\u2019m 22 years old. I think the pimples on my face are from Hershey bars. I am a Jew in heat. And this girl \u2013 no one has ever said to me I want you. And I suddenly said to myself, there are more than two benefits to being in this business. So, I said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She says, \u201cCome over. Come over my house.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m on the air. I get off at 6:00. I\u2019ll be over at 6:00.\u201d She says, \u201cI only live 10 blocks away. And I have to go to work at 6:00. So, it\u2019s now or never.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s my address. Try to come over.\u201d I got this moral dilemma now. My career, my radio, or no one has ever said I want you. So, here\u2019s what the radio audience heard. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019m just filling in tonight. So, I\u2019m going to give you a particularly good time here. I\u2019m going to play the entire Harry Belafonte at Carnegie Hall album uninterrupted.\u201d I had 23 minutes, which is all the time I needed, and which is still true to this day. Anyway, I put the record on. We didn\u2019t have tapes then. It was an actual record. Zoom out to the car, drive out to her house, there\u2019s the car she described it in the driveway. I pulled into the house, the light is on. Over to the door, I go in. There\u2019s a little, dark room, and there\u2019s this woman in a white negligee sitting on the couch. She opens her arms. I grab her. I pulled her around. My cheek is against her cheek. And she\u2019s got the radio on. And I\u2019m hearing Harry Belafonte and he says \u2013 he\u2019s singing Jamaica Farewell. And he sings, \u201cDown the way where the nights, where the nights, where the nights, where the nights,\u201d the record gets stuck. I place the girl back at the end of the couch, run out to my car. Jewish masochism. I keep the radio on all the way driving to the station. Where the nights, where the nights, where the nights, where the nights. I get in, all of the lights are going flashing from people calling in. I\u2019m totally embarrassed. I\u2019m picking up, I\u2019m apologizing to people. And the last caller was an older Jewish man. And I just said, \u201cWAHR, good morning.\u201d And all I hear was, \u201cWhere the nights, where the nights, where the nights. I\u2019m going crazy with where the nights.\u201d I said, \u201cGee, I\u2019m sorry. Why didn\u2019t you just change the station?\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m an invalid, and I\u2019m in bed. And a nurse takes care me. She leaves at night. She sets it to your station. The radio is up on the bureau. I can\u2019t reach it. I\u2019m stuck.\u201d And I said, \u201cGee, can I do anything for you?\u201d He says, \u201cYeah, play [inaudible].\u201d But I didn\u2019t get fired for that. Another thing that I almost got fired, and I don\u2019t know if you even know this story, Cal. I had to make a living, so, I was making like $60.00 a week from the radio station. And I was doing \u2013 when I first started on television, I was making $100.00 from that. And I was also the announcer at the dog track. There goes Rusty, Miami Beach Dog Track. It was right near Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs. I used to walk in, look into Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs window, and say, \u201cI wonder if I can ever eat there.\u201d Anyway, I was doing three jobs. And this was New Year\u2019s Eve. So, I taped the television show, did my radio show, and did the dog track. Now, the next morning, I\u2019m on. I think it was on that shift, I was on 8:00 to 12:00 or 8:00 to 11:00, whatever it was. So, I\u2019m dead tired. And it\u2019s New Year\u2019s morning. No one at the station. And it\u2019s a news station, WKAT. And there\u2019s big window doors leading in where you could look up and see the announcer in the station. And I\u2019m so tired. And I\u2019m just playing music and talking. And oh, my God, please. And 9:00, Don McNeil and the Breakfast Club goes on. That\u2019s a show from Chicago. It\u2019s an hour every day, syndicated. Good morning, breakfast lovers and howdy do ya. At the 9:30 point in that show, Don McNeil would say we\u2019ll be back in 30 seconds. This is the ABC Radio Network. And all I had to do was turn off that mic, turn on my mic and say this is WKAT, the big cat in Miami Beach, and switch that switch back on and go back to Chicago and turn mine off. Well, what I did was, he said, \u201cThis is the ABC Radio Network.\u201d And I turned him off, turned my mic on, and fell asleep. Cal Fussman: Oh, man. Larry King: No, I\u2019m the only one in the station, and I\u2019m snoring like this. Anyway, all people at home hear is [snoring]. So, they panic. Somebody called the Miami Beach Police Department, and the Fire Department comes. They look in the window, and they see a guy slumped against the microphone. And they figure I\u2019m dead. So, they take hatchets and break their way in through the window. And as they break all of the hatchets in, I wake up. And now, you\u2019re listening on the radio, and the firemen are going, \u201cAre you okay, sir.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell is going on.\u201d All of this is on the air. And I look up, and it\u2019s like 9:45. And I say, \u201cNow, back to the breakfast club with Don McNeil.\u201d And the general manager of the station, Frank Catzentine, called me in. Cal Fussman: Did you think you were going to get fired? Larry King: Think? All he said was, \u201cI know you\u2019re glib, and I know you\u2019re good. We like your work. But give me any reason why I shouldn\u2019t fire you. Any reason, if it\u2019s within reason, I\u2019ll accept it because I like you, but I got to fire you. By all rules of radio and ethics, I got to fire you.\u201d I said to him, \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s what I was doing. I was attempting to check the reaction of the Miami Beach Fire and Rescue Department. How quickly can they come to an emergency? They got there pretty fast. We could have a good report on this. I\u2019ll do a little special.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou son of a bitch. Get out of here.\u201d But I had to pay for the window. He took out $10.00 a week out of my salary until the window was paid for. But those occurrences, with the lady, nothing ever happened because management was asleep. I never got in trouble for something I said. I never cursed on the air. I never said something that would bring me into repute. I just was \u2013 I loved the radio. And then, now, I\u2019m on the internet. And people curse on the internet. I\u2019ve had guests say the F word. I still can\u2019t. I can\u2019t bring myself to do it because I\u2019m so cognizant of the microphone and the old rules. Cal Fussman: Well, first thing, are we hearing Biscuit the dog snoring? Larry King: That\u2019s fine. Cal Fussman: I\u2019m just taking Larry\u2019s advice here and just describing what\u2019s going on. Larry King: Biscuit snores. You can take him and put him in another room. He don\u2019t care. He\u2019s 8 years old now. He\u2019s just an old dog. That adds to the \u2013 see, here\u2019s the beauty of the podcast. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s right. Now, they know Biscuit. Larry King: Right. In the old days, you would have been signaling the guy to try to get him to take the \u2013 cut that, cut that, watch that, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t \u2013 what the hell? Biscuit was snoring, if you heard the sound. If you didn\u2019t hear it, okay, that\u2019s what he cut for. If you did hear it, it\u2019s cute. Cal Fussman: And Tim has got a dog, Molly, who he often has on his podcast and is always a great audience. One of the things about Tim\u2019s audience is they want to know how to be better in all aspects of life. What would you say \u2013 let\u2019s talk a little about curiosity, about speaking, listening, empathy. You are one of the most curious people I\u2019ve ever met. Is that something that is engrained? Or is it something that everybody has but somehow, you never lost? Larry King: Good question, Cal. That\u2019s why the Fussman Factor podcast will be a success. Truthfully, I don\u2019t know. I was always curious. I remember, as an 8-year-old or 9-year-old, I\u2019d get on the bus and ask the bus driver why do you want to drive a bus. My curiosity was endless. So, it lent me into a broadcast booth that worked for me. That worked for me. My curiosity worked for me. I never got good grades in school, except in things with oral projects like English where I could ask questions of the teacher. So, I always had that curiosity and managed to find a work place that brought it to me. I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I could give you rules. Cal Fussman: Sure, what are rules? Larry King: Listen. Listening is as important as what you\u2019re asking. So, don\u2019t worry about your next question. Now, that\u2019s risk taking, but don\u2019t worry about your next question. Cal Fussman: Often, you see, when people are in conversation, you can almost look at somebody carefully and see they\u2019re thinking about what they\u2019re going to say next. Larry King: Now, that is natural. I react. You can\u2019t tell someone just starting. So, someone just starting, if it\u2019s comfortable for you to make little notes to yourself so you have a bridge to fall back on, do it. You want to be good. But, eventually, get to be where you don\u2019t need those notes. Your curiosity works for you. And sometimes, the simplest question is the best. Like when we had the first \u2013 the war in Kuwait when we went into Iraq, we didn\u2019t go to Baghdad. Cal Fussman: Oh, Desert Storm, right. Larry King: We would have generals on every night and reporters. And I would hear people out of other stations, \u201cThis happened today and this happened.\u201d My first question was what happened today. Okay. Now, I\u2019m getting their perspective of what happened today. Now, based on their answer, I\u2019ll have to have another question, and I would. Whatever the answer was, even if it was today, the troops advanced 10 miles into the enemy territory. That\u2019s the answer. Cal Fussman: Okay. Larry King: Did that surprise you? Cal Fussman: There you go. Larry King: Here we go, go right with it. Why did they do that? Do you trust the information that your superiors give you? There\u2019s so many things like I watch interviews today, they\u2019re nuts. People are terrible, especially after sporting events. Cal Fussman: What\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve seen? Larry King: I see it every day. We have just seen a sporting event. A guy just got his first major league homerun to win the game. One stupid question I saw was this was your first major league game. It was the ninth inning. The count was 2 and 1, and you hit that homerun to right field. And they put the mic in front of them. What\u2019s the question? There\u2019s no question. Or the second dumbest question. You got a home run and you\u2019re first at bat. What does it feel like? He\u2019s going to answer, terrible. I didn\u2019t to hit a homerun. I wanted to strike out. I would go other areas like when you played little league, what were some of your baseball dreams. And he might say to play in my first game. Did you ever visualize hitting a homerun? What were you thinking when you were on deck?\u00a0Were your parents here? Cal Fussman: And not only are these unexpected questions, but they\u2019re easily answered. Yes, my parents were here or no, they weren\u2019t. Larry King: And then, feeling with them, talk to them. In other words, put yourself \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of how would you be in that situation, except you don\u2019t have to refer to yourself. You don\u2019t have to say I would have done. I don\u2019t use the word I. I ask questions because I\u2019m an observer. I\u2019m present at the creation. I like to be there. Again it\u2019s the moment. I like to be in the moment. Cal Fussman: Can what you do be used by anybody in their office? Larry King: I would guess so. I do a course based on the book How to Talk to Anyone Anytime, Anywhere. I\u2019ve had some successful people tell me that the book helped them in their life. It\u2019s still in print. I saw it in Norway. Yes, you can because, in a communicating world, now, the big difference today is, with modern technology, it\u2019s probably easier today to text. So, people text today, which is sad to me. So, you don\u2019t need the art of phrasing. You don\u2019t need to use your voice well. Cal Fussman: Do we lose something? You see people with their cell phones in their hands looking down. Larry King: Terrible. Cal Fussman: What do we lose when we no longer have eye contact with people? Larry King: Intimacy. That\u2019s what I want in every show I do, an intimate relationship with the guest. If I can establish that like Sinatra, I\u2019ve got a letter here Sinatra wrote to me after his last television interview. You make the camera disappear. Intimacy, trust. If the guest will trust you, you\u2019re home because they know you\u2019re sincerely interested in them. And, therefore, you could go anywhere. You can go anywhere. It depends how you phrase the question, how you feel. But if you could put yourself in their shoes and get their emotion, it\u2019s a good tip. Nobody thinks they\u2019re bad. Nobody. Hitler didn\u2019t comb his hair in the morning and say, \u201cI am an evil person. I am doing good for my country.\u201d So, if you\u2019re going to interview Hitler, the stupidest first question would be why did you invade Poland. The best kind of first question is, if I were interviewing Osama Bin Laden, the stupidest first question would be why did you kill 3,000 people on that September day in New York? I would have asked him, \u201cYou grew up in the richest family in Saudi Arabia. Why did you leave?\u201d Now, that gets him to think. But what he didn\u2019t think about why he left that day. But now \u2013 Cal Fussman: You\u2019ve made him curious about himself. Larry King: Right. But he also knows I\u2019m sincerely curious about him. I have made no judgment in that question. I don\u2019t bring an agenda. What do we want? We want to learn. All we want is information. We why to know the whys of Osama Bin Laden. Wouldn\u2019t that help you understand, when you\u2019re dealing with the Osama Bin Laden of the future, why do you want to know? All we want is \u2013 I remember once, I had this great guy on, Swami Satchidananda. I never forgot him, from India. And he was so calm about everything. And he was the kind of guy, I remember he said, \u201cWhen you wake up in the morning, when you open your eyes, did you deserve that day? Whether you believe in God or whatever, did Larry \u2013 did the Swami deserve this day?\u201d You woke up, it\u2019s a gift. You don\u2019t know where it came from. It\u2019s a gift, the gift of life. You woke up. So, what if it\u2019s raining? You\u2019ve got the gift of the day. So, what if the toast is burnt? Make more toast. You\u2019ve got the gift. I said to him, \u201cSwami, what if I told you I\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow at 3:00, take you to the airport, and I don\u2019t show? What would you do?\u201d \u201cI would call you and say, Larry, how are you? I know something terrible must have happened because you weren\u2019t there. The shoe is on your foot.\u201d Then, I asked him the world\u2019s greatest question. \u201cOkay, Swami,\u201d I was being cute, \u201cYou come home, walk up into your bedroom, and your wife is in bed with another guy.\u201d And he said to me, \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d And I said, \u201cI would scream and yell, and that\u2019s what everyone would do. Scream and yell. The guy would run out, and the woman would be screaming, and pandemonium.\u201d But what do you want in that situation? Cal Fussman: Information. Larry King: Information. How is the best way to get it? \u201cOkay, this is very embarrassing, you two. I\u2019m going to go down and make some tea. Why don\u2019t the both of you come down to breakfast then. Let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d Who owns that moment? Cal Fussman: You\u2019re in control. Larry King: Yeah. That\u2019s the hardest thing to do. But, basically, that\u2019s what I would do on the air. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing that? My curiosity would be there no matter what the situation. And, eventually, I would be asking Osama Bin Laden why did he send those people out that day in September. Cal Fussman: The more you\u2019re talking, the more I\u2019m seeing the power of control in questions. Larry King: It\u2019s all control. For most of my life in this great business, I have controlled my environment when working. And, for a lot of time, when I did my national radio show, I did the first national network show, I was on from midnight to 5:00. I was on CNN from 9:00 to 10:00. I wrote a weekly column in USA Today. When I was writing the column, when I was on the radio for five hours, and when I was on television for the hour, I control all of that. Cal Fussman: So, people could, actually, use what you were doing to gain a better control over their own lives, even if it\u2019s not in broadcasting, just the use of the questions, like the swami said. Larry King: Unfortunately, I don\u2019t do as well in the personal life. Everyone has their \u2013 a lot of comedians are very unhappy people. Cal Fussman: Right. Larry King: And they see things funny for an escape from their own reality. So, I do very well in this circumstance sitting here talking to you. But I couldn\u2019t hang a picture well. I\u2019d hit my thumb. I\u2019m not a \u2013 I try to be a good driver. I\u2019m not a great driver. In other words, no one is perfect. But in areas where you can, especially in the work environment, where you can control something, yeah, I could teach you how to do it. Cal Fussman: What about empathy? Because that seems to be a quality that you have. You can listen to anybody, and you\u2019re making them feel \u2013 Larry King: I\u2019m not judgmental. Cal Fussman: Right. Larry King: That I learned from broadcasting. What am I going to judge? I\u2019m there to learn. Let the audience \u2013 see, the audience makes up its own mind. I\u2019m a conduit from me to you. I learn, and through me, you learn. But I don\u2019t make a judgment call. In other words, I\u2019m not the kind of broadcaster who argues with the guest. It\u2019s just not my style. I am passionate politically, off the air. But I felt at best as a broadcaster that my role as a journalist was to give you \u2013 at the end of an hour, and you knew more the hour before. When there\u2019s arguing, you don\u2019t learn. I don\u2019t like broadcasts where the guy just stands on a soapbox and talks for an hour. Cal Fussman: Well, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any empathy on TV anymore. Larry King: That\u2019s gone. The day of the long form interview is kind of gone. It\u2019s sad. Cal Fussman: Actually, it seems like the podcast is one way of trying to \u2013 Larry King: That\u2019s the last venue of the long form interview. This could not occur on television today. What you\u2019re doing right now could not occur. For a radio station, it would be rare because, today, people want eat it up, speed it up, get it out. It\u2019s a spit it out business. Get it up, get it out. Can\u2019t get enough, get right through it. Today, the rules are you do an interview show today, the guest should be on tops 10 minutes. You don\u2019t want a half hour interview today. They\u2019re going to tune out because they\u2019ve got 500 channels. And you can\u2019t \u2013 and I think technology has added \u2013 Cal Fussman: What are we losing? Larry King: Knowledge. Cal Fussman: So, we\u2019re not getting the information. And when you look at everything that\u2019s going on politically, it seems like we\u2019re not getting any depth anymore. Larry King: That\u2019s why this New York Times that I have right here is my Bible. I learn more from it every day than I get from all of cable television. And they\u2019ve got cameras. New York Times doesn\u2019t. But they can write an in depth article that continues on Page 46. And I get more out of it. The sad thing is that newspapers are going away. That\u2019s all part of \u2013 technology brings improvements, and they bring bad things, too. When I spoke in Norway a couple of weeks ago, and someone was asking me about technology, here\u2019s the best and the worst thing about it. We know that somewhere in the world today, a guy is working on a cure for cancer, this brilliant scientist. Another guy is writing a great play. And another guy is inventing a new kind of airplane that will exceed the speed of sound. And another guy is planning how to build a nuclear weapon that you can hide in your hands and get on a plane. He\u2019s doing that, too. So, the guy who is curing cancer, he\u2019s going to succeed. But the guy with the bomb is going to succeed, too. So, this is what you face as we advance as a culture. We advance. Remember, the small grocer got overtaken. I liked the small grocer. I liked the guy who took the little pencil who added up on the paper bag and took the clipper and got the toilet paper down from the top of the rack. That\u2019s gone. Cal Fussman: The interesting thing to me though is that it seems like questions are becoming more important now because, in this age of technology, you can Google any answer. A 6-year-old can Google any answer to any question in 4 seconds. But the right question, no. That 6-year-old might not be able to come up with it. Larry King: Ask more. Go through a day, and see how many people ask questions rather than say things. My motto, my broadcast motto all of my life was I never learned anything when I was talking. Cal Fussman: And that\u2019s interesting because you see TV and the idea is just to talk over somebody to get your point \u2013 Larry King: Now, at times, you have to. For example, if I\u2019m speaking, if you speak, as you do, and I\u2019m making a comment in front of a group, of course. I\u2019m not learning anything. But I\u2019m entertaining. That\u2019s different. You can entertain. If I\u2019m telling a joke, I know the end of the joke. So, I\u2019m not learning anything, but I\u2019m providing entertainment. If I\u2019m making a speech, I\u2019m not learning anything, but I\u2019m providing knowledge. But if I\u2019m a questioner, I never learned anything when I was talking. If I\u2019m asking a question of you, it better be a question not a statement, not a history lesson. Ask the question. So many people, I want to yell sometimes is what\u2019s the question. Cal Fussman: I hear what you\u2019re saying. Is there advice that you would give young people to better ask questions? I\u2019ll sit down before an interview, and I\u2019ll write out maybe 200 questions I want to ask. Larry King: If that\u2019s what works for you. Never do what doesn\u2019t work for you. So, if Larry King says don\u2019t wrote out questions in advance that would be stupid for me to say. I don\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t tell you what to do. Whatever is your comfort zone. Cal Fussman: Is there something about the foundation of I did these speeches, change your questions, change your life, to look at questions a different way, to look at the power in them. Step aside from where you are. Look at yourself and see how a different question could change your position. Is this something that you have done? Or you\u2019re just constantly in the moment. Larry King: I never sat down and figured it out. I\u2019m just in the moment. I didn\u2019t do self analysis. I\u2019m in the moment. But I know that listening is as important as asking. Listening is as important as what you ask because follow up is. You have to be in the moment. Cal Fussman: Is there advice? Is there ways for people to improve their listening? Larry King: I guess. In this modern age of technology where you have instant information and where you can text people, listen is a weird word. Think about the word listen. What are you listening to today? You\u2019re reading stuff off your little iPhone. Cal Fussman: And often, people have their ears plugged to take in what they want to hear. So, they\u2019re pushing away the outside. Larry King: I\u2019ll tell you, often, how people don\u2019t listen. We can test it. I did this with Jim Bishop one day. In Miami, he did a column on this. When you see someone that you know and pass on the street, how you doing? Right? I say I\u2019ve got brain cancer. How is the wife? Because they don\u2019t listen. How are you doing? They don\u2019t want to know how you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t stop. How am I doing? I\u2019ll tell you how I\u2019m doing. The bank called me today. The second mortgage payment. You want to know how I\u2019m doing? Sit down, I\u2019ll tell you how I\u2019m doing. Cal Fussman: Is there a way to break through that sort of cocktail party banter that means nothing? Larry King: Now, this I don\u2019t know the answer to. I have always had people respond to me. And it\u2019s worked with women. Cal Fussman: So, you just get genuine, sincere responses. Larry King: Yeah. And as George Burns said, \u201cIf you can fake that, you got it made.\u201d But I have always known, in interview situations, I\u2019ve always known that I can get people to respond to me. So, I could use humor. I could use \u2013 but they know that I really want to know what they\u2019re thinking and why they did what they did. And people appreciate that. I don\u2019t know anybody that doesn\u2019t like to talk about what they did, except Brando who didn\u2019t like to talk about acting. Cal Fussman: But that can be useful to anybody in any situation, in the office \u2013 Larry King: Of course. Cal Fussman: Just by looking into somebody and being \u2013 Larry King: Being sincere and zeroing in. Cal Fussman: Right. Larry King: There\u2019s two questions you ask in the same quest. Why did you do that? Or why did you do that? You\u2019re going to get a better answer with the second. Cal Fussman: Right. I was doing some reading, and they say that, when you take in a question, 10 percent is only the words, 30 percent is the tone of voice, what you just illustrated. Larry King: Tone is very important, which you don\u2019t get with your iPhone. Cal Fussman: And 60 percent is the body language behind that question. Larry King: Which you don\u2019t get with your iPhone. Cal Fussman: Yeah. And so, I guess this is something people can work on, if they want to, to learn how to better communicate. Larry King: Yeah. Well, we\u2019re trying all of the time. How to Talk to Anyone Anytime, Anywhere. How to be better \u2013 we all want to do better. You\u2019re always learning. And you always accept the fact that you\u2019re still learning. Cal Fussman: If you\u2019re in sales, you got to connect with people. If you\u2019re a leader of a company, you got to connect with people. And, basically, they can use the same skills that you\u2019re using. Larry King: Or course. Anyone can use them. Presidents of countries can use them. Cal Fussman: I got some questions from Tim that he sent over. Larry King: Okay. This is the Ferriss wheel question. Cal Fussman: This is the Ferriss wheel question. Larry King: We\u2019ve been going a long time here, Cal. Cal Fussman: Okay. It didn\u2019t feel that way to me. Larry King: Well, we\u2019ve been over an hour. I don\u2019t want to break it to you, Cal, but you\u2019re starting to get annoying. And I want to tell you, listeners. This is going to be a great podcast. But there does hit a point with the Fussman Factor where he gets annoying. And we\u2019re very close to that point now. Yes, what questions does the Ferriss wheel want? Cal Fussman: This is from Tim. If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere, what would it say and why? Larry King: A gigantic billboard anywhere? Let me think. Good question, Tim. Slow down! Or ban all guns. Cal Fussman: There you go. I was thinking the John Wooden line when you said slow down. He said, \u201cBe quick, but don\u2019t hurry.\u201d That\u2019s pretty good. Larry King: That\u2019s good. Cal Fussman: What is the book, Tim asks, you\u2019ve given most as a gift and why? Larry King: I guess, through life, it\u2019s Catcher in the Rye. I love that book. I read it at four different times in my life. Teenager and later. Cal Fussman: Does it change? Larry King: Yeah. You get different meanings from it. I get different reactions. For example, my son, Chance, who is 18 hated Holden Caulfield, thought he was a pompous, spoiled brat. I never saw him that way, didn\u2019t find him funny. It\u2019s interesting the way kids \u2013 that perspective. That\u2019s good writing. If you can react hostilely to it. Cal Fussman: Yeah. And 50 years from now, he may have a very different look at it. Larry King: Right. For example, you read Dickens, I like Scrooge. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy, Scrooge. Look at it this way, Cratchit was a big complainer. He\u2019s a whiner. Come home, he\u2019s got a son, Tiny Tim. Take care of him. Stop with the crap. Do your work. Look at this dog. Cal Fussman: Biscuit. Can you name one to three books that have massively impacted your life? Larry King: Well, Catcher in the Rye would be one. A Quiet Hero, the Life of Lou Gehrig, and then, most of the books I\u2019m currently reaching. Richard Nixon\u2019s biography, it\u2019s terrific, by John Farrell. I\u2019m into the moment of what I\u2019m doing now. Cal Fussman: You read like six books at once. I\u2019ve been with you on airplanes. Larry King: What I try to do is a novel and nonfiction. And I can read those two at once. But I got three going now. Cal Fussman: What\u2019s the third? Larry King: I got the Richard Nixon book, and I got Alec Baldwin\u2019s memoir \u2013 Cal Fussman: Oh, you were reading the Franken \u2013 Larry King: I finished Al Franken\u2019s book. Fantastic. Funny, on the mark, funny. And then, I\u2019m reading Shattered, the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Cal Fussman: Pretty good title. In the last five years, what new belief or behavior has most improved your life? Do you have new beliefs in the last five years? Larry King: No, but the more I exist, the less I believe in something out there. I don\u2019t believe in God. I don\u2019t believe in life after death. Most people get older, and they find some belief. I get older and find less. I have no \u2013 this is it. Cal Fussman: You\u2019re just in the moment. Larry King: The thing I fear the most is death because I can\u2019t imagine not existing. That drives me bonkers. Cal Fussman: We were talking about this at breakfast that we\u2019re all energy. Larry King: Yeah. I don\u2019t know what you mean by that, we\u2019re all energy. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s what we are. We\u2019re energy. And so, you\u2019re still going to be floating around somehow. Larry King: Come on. I\u2019m floating around. Do I know where I am? Cal Fussman: Well, you\u2019re not going to know it. Well, I can\u2019t make any guarantees on that. But I have a feeling that you never go away. And, certainly, you will be around for all of us to remember you.\u00a0What about memories? Larry King: Yeah. Memory, you\u2019ll have tapes of me. I can exist. But I\u2019m not there, you understand, Fussman? I don\u2019t exist. Cal Fussman: I get it. Larry King: And that bugs me to not exist. For example, who is going to be the next president? Who is going to win the pennant? The why person fears death. Cal Fussman: Because they\u2019re not going to know the answers. Larry King: It\u2019s the one thing \u2013 I married into a family, they all believe. They\u2019re Mormons. They believe I\u2019m going somewhere else. And I say to them you can\u2019t lose. You\u2019re in a win/win. If you die and you go somewhere else, you were right. If you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t know it. They can\u2019t lose. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s good strategy. Larry King: It don\u2019t work for me because I can\u2019t accept the fact. There\u2019s no heaven. There\u2019s no other plain. I\u2019m not going to some planet. Cal Fussman: Stay here. What purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last 6 months or recent memory? Larry King: Where did he come up with that question? A $100.00 or less? Cal Fussman: I don\u2019t know. Tim, where did you come up with that question? Larry King: That\u2019s a Ferriss wheel. That\u2019s the kind of thing, if you\u2019re stuck on a Ferriss wheel, you think of stuff like that. Ferriss, if I\u2019m stuck at the top of a Ferriss wheel, first, I\u2019m panicked. I\u2019m Jewish. It\u2019s never going to start again, and I\u2019m stuck on the Ferriss wheel. Cal Fussman: So, less than $100.00. Larry King: What did I spend less than $100.00 on that did what? Cal Fussman: Had a positive impact on your life. Larry King: As a child, it was a yo-yo because I never could master the yo-yo, and it would drive me crazy. And the fact that I couldn\u2019t master it drove me crazy. So, I don\u2019t know why I just thought of that. Cal Fussman: Well, it would probably have been like a Dodger ticket when you were a kid. Larry King: Yeah. Cal Fussman: Now, they\u2019re more than $100.00. Larry King: When I was a kid, one of the biggest thrills of my life was a ticket to Ebbets Field. I\u2019d go down to Montague Street and buy reserved seats when you could afford them, $1.75, to hold those tickets and look at them. Now, there\u2019s a piece of paper. You put it in your phone. I don\u2019t do that. When I go to the airport, I want a boarding pass. And I\u2019d like it to be thick not paper. You can\u2019t get them. You can get pieces of paper. I\u2019m very pissed. You got me very angry, Fussman. Cal Fussman: First annoyed, now angry. How about what advice would you give to a college senior about to enter the real world? And what advice would you give a smart, aggressive 30-year-old? Larry King: Well, to a college senior, if you have goal, don\u2019t give up. If you want to do something in life, and someone can tell you you can\u2019t do it, and if you believe that, then, you can\u2019t do it. If you think you can do it, you can do it. If you think you can do it, you can do it. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s actually great advice. Larry King: And if you think you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it. And if you can do it, but you think you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t. Cal Fussman: You\u2019re cooked. Larry King: You\u2019ve got to think you can do it. Cal Fussman: What about a 30-year-old? Larry King: A 30-year-old is almost the same thing. A 30-year-old, you\u2019re at that bridge. That\u2019s why I love athletes. Athletes\u2019 lives, their careers end when most of ours begin. So, they face winning and losing. They face the final score. They face cheering that stops. We don\u2019t have it. No one else in life has that. Most of our careers kick off around 35, 40, and that\u2019s when they\u2019re done. And also, they\u2019re getting paid for something that they did when they were 7 years old and did it for more hours. Cal Fussman: How is it failure or apparent failure set you up for later success? Do you have a favorite failure? Larry King: Well, you learn from loss. You learn a lot more from losing than from winning. Cal Fussman: Well, probably the two stories you told about Jamaica Farewell and then falling asleep. Larry King: There were other failures, too. Failure in marriage. I wasn\u2019t good at it. That\u2019s because my job came first. See, again, my love for my broadcasting has hindered me in other areas because I\u2019m driven by that. CNN and Mutual Radio were the No. 1 things in my life, No. 1. Children were better, but I was a better worker than a father. I\u2019m a better father now. Old age has \u2013 see, but the weird thing about old age, Fussman, for the Fussman Factor, is I\u2019m 83. But I\u2019m 17. In other words, I know I\u2019m 83 from the pains and the little tribulations of life. But I\u2019m 17. For example, you know what keeps me going? I wonder what I want to do when I grow up. I like being called promising. In other words, when I get a call like you\u2019ve just been awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Emmy\u2019s, which I got six years ago, Lifetime Achievement \u2013 Cal Fussman: That probably made you mad. Larry King: Wonderful thrill, but, at the same time, is that it? You mean it\u2019s over? Over? And I look at my trophy room. I have a trophy room right next door to this room. And it\u2019s got all of the accolades over the years and the awards. I go in there. It\u2019s my ego room. But I sit in there. And I say to myself who the hell did this? Who the hell \u2013 I look around at pictures and people and me with people. Who the hell? How the hell did I do this? And it\u2019s just \u2013 you know, Bertrand Russell, the great philosopher and Nobel Prize winner, mathematician was 95 years old, and he had a dinner party. Someone said, \u201cDr. Russell, you\u2019re 95, a great mathematician, great writer, Nobel Prize. What do you know? What do you know?\u201d And he said, \u201cThe only thing I know is that I don\u2019t know.\u201d And if I had to sum up everything about human nature, about war, about life, about love, about the meaning of things, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve had a lifetime of discovery. I\u2019ve learned a lot of things. But on the basic things of life, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about women. I don\u2019t know about someone looking after me. I don\u2019t know about things up there. I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m an agnostic, but I just can\u2019t make that leap. I can\u2019t make the leap of faith. It\u2019s too big a leap. And when people have it, there\u2019s a sense of envy, but, at the same time, I don\u2019t mean to put them down, but a sense that they need a crutch. I don\u2019t have a crutch. Cal Fussman: I have a few more questions here from Tim. What are bad recommendations you hear in your area of expertise? Larry King: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to answer that. I\u2019ve never heard people give bad recommendations. A bad recommendation would be you don\u2019t need college. I think, today, you do. In my day, you didn\u2019t. Now, you do. The world is too competitive. Cal Fussman: What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? Larry King: Unusual habit? I have a habit of \u2013 thought habits. I try to total up words in a phrase or a sentence and then divide it to see if I get an even number. Like true love divided by two is four. There\u2019s four words in each things, four and four. Cal Fussman: Oh, the letters. I see what you\u2019re saying. Larry King: So, I don\u2019t want an odd number, I want an even number. I do that a lot in my head. Cal Fussman: You\u2019re doing it while you\u2019re asking questions? Larry King: No, no, no. I try not to get distracted. Cal Fussman: Okay. Yeah, that would be like having a calculator going off. Larry King: No, no, no. Cal Fussman: But that\u2019s okay. That is unusual. Larry King: Yeah. But everyone has little unusual things. For example, my pills, I take a lot of prescription pills and a lot of vitamins. They have to be in order in the closet. And when, I lay them out for the next day, I have to take them out in the same order. That\u2019s a rule. Cal Fussman: Well, that\u2019s control and organization. A lot of what we\u2019re talking about is about control. Larry King: I\u2019m very organized. And I hate \u2013 hate is a bad word. Disorganized people annoy me. I told my wife this morning, we\u2019re having dinner at Wolfgang\u2019s tonight. If you want to come over, come over. Greg is coming. I don\u2019t know who is coming. But we\u2019re having dinner at Wolfgang\u2019s tonight. Two hours later, I say to her we\u2019ll go at 7:30. Where are we going? Wolfgang\u2019s. She says I don\u2019t listen to details like that. You what? She doesn\u2019t know \u2013 Cal Fussman: You\u2019re in the moment. Larry King: She\u2019s not in any moment. She doesn\u2019t know \u2013 she\u2019s got a plane tomorrow. She has no idea what time the plane is going. Cal Fussman: I think there are a lot of people like that. Larry King: I know what time my plane is going a week from Friday. Cal Fussman: I got it. In the last five years, this is a good question, Tim, have you become better at saying no to distractions, invitations, etc? Larry King: No. Cal Fussman: No, he has not. Larry cannot say no. Larry King: It\u2019s the hardest word in the English language is no, and that\u2019s what people where people with texts can get away with it. Cal Fussman: Because it\u2019s easier to type N-O. Larry King: It\u2019s easier to type no. Cal Fussman: Why can\u2019t you say no? Larry King: I guess I don\u2019t like rejection and I, therefore, don\u2019t like to reject others. I know it\u2019s stupid because, eventually, it cancels something because you don\u2019t want to disappoint them initially. Cal Fussman: So, five people can ask you to go out to dinner on Wednesday night \u2013 Larry King: I\u2019m too much in the moment, so, I have to give a satisfactory answer to each, and it could drive you crazy. It works on the air. It doesn\u2019t work on the air. A lot of things that work professionally \u2013 Cal Fussman: Don\u2019t work off the air. Larry King: Don\u2019t work off the air. Cal Fussman: What is the best or most worthwhile investment you\u2019ve made? It could be in money, time, energy. Larry King: In my career. That paid off the most. The time I invested, the jobs I took, working radio, working the dog track, all of those little things. Cal Fussman: I\u2019m really getting also a sense of discipline. Larry King: Yeah. In work ethic not in life ethic. I never handle money well, I still don\u2019t. I don\u2019t handle my own money. I keep kind of a small checking account, but I have accountants in Boston that do everything. I have never seen a CNN check, never seen it. I don\u2019t know what it looks like or what TV checks look like. I keep a checking account, but I don\u2019t know what pay checks look like. When I get speeches, they go right to the Speakers\u2019 Bureau, and they send it to Boston. I don\u2019t know. It would be nice to see what a check looks like. Cal Fussman: Okay. The last question \u2013 Larry King: Finally with the Fussman Factor. We\u2019ll do an hour. Well, Fussman, we\u2019re at an hour and 35 minutes, Fussman. Cal Fussman: Okay. Well \u2013 Larry King: This is the world\u2019s longest podcast. Cal Fussman: Longest first podcast. Larry King: You\u2019re doing very well, Fussman. Cal Fussman: Well, thank you. When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or you\u2019ve lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? Maybe this goes back to the swami, you just look for information. Larry King: No, I get lost in sports. As we\u2019re doing this, I\u2019m watching a baseball game. And I could do this, and I know what\u2019s happening. So, sports is a great thrill to me. I feel sorry for people who aren\u2019t sports fans. Do you know why? When I get up in the morning, I have no idea who is going to win the games that day. None. So, I have wonderment every day. Who is going to win? What\u2019s going to happen? Cal Fussman: So, you\u2019re talking, and you\u2019re looking at the screen. And your curiosity is at play wondering, okay, what\u2019s happening. Larry King: Well, I can\u2019t see what this player is saying, but I know the Royals have come here with the hottest team. The Dodgers are the hottest team in baseball by far. And the Dodgers just keep winning, by amazement, they just keep winning. So, I love that. I\u2019m amazed at it. I\u2019m involved in it. And, by the way, I still remain emotionally involved in the teams I like. And so, I get a lot of rewards out of being a fan of games. Cal Fussman: You\u2019re still in the moment. Now, this is a bucket list request. Larry King: My bucket list? Cal Fussman: It\u2019s going to be my bucket list, but go ahead.\u00a0You tell me your bucket list. Larry King: Every Fussman Factor goes back to Fussman. By the way, you are listening to the longest podcast ever. Fussman out to break world records at all time. Fussman is trying to write War and Punishment. What was the longest book ever written? Cal Fussman: War and Peace. Larry King: War and Peace. Cal Fussman: And Crime and Punishment. Larry King: Yeah, I combined two books and got the world\u2019s biggest \u2013 Cal Fussman: There you go. Larry King: I would like to do a Broadway show, a Larry King on Broadway as himself. Like Larry King Tonight. And you come, and I tell my stories and take questions from the audience, an 8:00 curtain with the theater bill. It\u2019s the one thing \u2013 I\u2019ve done standup comedy. I did a comedy tour and everything. But to be on a Broadway stage as a theater group, that\u2019s something I would like to do. That\u2019s a bucket list. I\u2019m not big on travel. I don\u2019t have to see the Great Wall of China. I\u2019ve seen pictures. Like we have a home in Utah. I don\u2019t like Utah. It\u2019s boring to me. They\u2019re beautiful mountains. Okay. I saw the mountain. I don\u2019t have to see it again tomorrow. So, that kind of wonderment I don\u2019t have. I wonder about people, but I don\u2019t wonder a lot about places. If I\u2019ve seen pictures of Berlin, I don\u2019t have to walk down the street in Berlin. But you, Fussman \u2013 Cal Fussman: I\u2019ve got to walk down the street in Berlin. Larry King: You\u2019re the wonder lust guy. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s right. It\u2019s very interesting because you have given me a lot of bucket list stuff. Larry King: Really? That I can enhance your life is a great moment to me, Fussman. Cal Fussman: Because of you, I know speak. Do you remember how I was when I first came to the breakfast table to help you? Larry King: Shy, Fussman. Cal Fussman: Hardly ever spoke. Larry King: Fussman did not speak. And now, I want to warn you of something. Do not become a bore. Sometimes, Fussman, you can overdo it. Don\u2019t overdo it. You\u2019re not a bore, Fussman. You\u2019re a great man. Cal Fussman: I haven\u2019t overdone it yet, but it\u2019s the reason that I\u2019m now on stage speaking to companies is because of you. Because I was sitting at the breakfast table every day listening to you speak. And we\u2019d go to your show at night. You\u2019d put me off on the side of the camera, and nobody would see me. But I\u2019m taking it all in. And I go \u2013 Larry King: And you\u2019ve done very well. I have to say. I\u2019ve watched you. You\u2019re a great speaker. I\u2019m very proud that I played a part in it. And I know that, if I die, maybe I\u2019ll be the one that doesn\u2019t, why not? There has to be a first in everything. But if I die, I will carry on through you. That you will keep my name going and your children and my children. So, I will exist in some form. Cal Fussman: As long as I\u2019m here, that\u2019s for sure. So, let\u2019s do the last bucket list. Larry King: And that is? Cal Fussman: This is my bucket list. There was a time when you were a kid, and you were listening to a baseball announcer. And then, he moved on to Florida. You moved on to Florida. And then, you were both working together. Larry King: Same station. Red Barber. Cal Fussman: Red Barber. And at the end of his report, he said, \u201cOver to you, Larry.\u201d Larry King: That was one of the great thrills of my life. Still remains a thrill. Here\u2019s a guy I listened to from age 7 or 8 on up. The guy who taught Vince Scully how to announce. The best baseball broadcast I ever heard. He had a southern accent. He came from Tallahassee, Florida. And I could always hear his voice in my head as people who have grown up in Los Angeles have Scully\u2019s voice in their head. So, when he \u2013 I\u2019m sitting there and I did my interview portion, and he would do the sports news. And he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the latest in sports. Larry?\u201d And when he said Larry, my God, the thing that went through my head is here\u2019s this little, Jewish kid from Brooklyn with his 48 pound transistor radio walking around on this Emerson radio to Coney Island listening to Red Barber describe a scene. And to make that picture come alive, Red gave me the game. When I walked into my first game at Ebbets Field shortly after my father died, my uncle took me, Arlene\u2019s father, Bernie, took me to the Dodger game. And I walked onto that field. And I saw the grass and the dirt and the white lines. But I knew that field because Red gave me that field. Cal Fussman: And so, then \u2013 Larry King: To work with him and interview him and talk about Jackie Robinson coming into the league and what he meant to Red. Go, give me the bucket list already. Cal Fussman: Here\u2019s the bucket list. Over to you, Lar? No. If you will say, over to you, Cal. Larry King: Oh, you want to hear that? Cal Fussman: I want to hear over to you, Cal. Larry King: Over to you, Cal. Cal, take it. Cal, go ahead. It\u2019s your turn, Cal. Take the ball and run with it. Cal Fussman: Over to you, Tim. Larry King: Over to you, Ferriss Wheel. Hey, Tim.\u00a0There\u2019s another guy coming that\u2019s going to have his own podcast, Sal Rollercoaster. Cal Fussman: Oh, no. Larry King: I think that\u2019s funny.

didn\u2019t know where i would start", "i\u2019m 22 years old", "my mother is now working", "i had to help support her", "my brother is in college", "and i\u2019m walking down the street, and a friend, i don\u2019t know who it was even, introduced me to a guy named james seramos who was director of announcers at cbs", "and i said to him, \u201ci would love to be a radio announcer", "what advice do you give me?\u201d and he said, \u201cwell, are you single?\u201d i said, \u201cyeah.\u201d he said, \u201ctry miami", "it\u2019s a big market, a lot of stations, no union", "and they might have older people on the way out and younger people on the way up", "and it might be a shot.\u201d so, my uncle, my mother\u2019s sister had passed away, and my uncle who owned a tuxedo store in new york had retired down to miami beach", "he had an apartment", "and he said i could stay with him because i had no money", "and i took a train down to miami", "and i think i had $11.00 or $12.00 in my pocket", "and i went to stay with him", "i arrived at the train station", "the first thing i saw was a water fountain that said \u201ccolored\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d, two water fountains", "i drank out of the colored fountain", "i had never seen a thing like that growing up in new york", "couldn\u2019t believe it", "i get on a bus to go over to miami beach", "i\u2019m sitting in the back", "the bus driver pulls over and asks me to please move up to the front", "the back is for negroes, and the front is for whites", "first day in miami", "so, i said, \u201cmy father is negro", "i prefer to sit in the back.\u201d i mean, it just annoyed me so much", "anyway, i went over, and i went around the radio stations", "and they wouldn\u2019t listen to me", "i was 22 years old", "so, you\u2019re just knocking on doors", "yeah", "no experience", "do you have any jobs open", "i went to wiod was one of the first stations i went to where i later worked for 19 years", "so, i went to this small station on miami beach, wahr, went in, very small station", "general manager was marshal simmons, a nice guy", "and he said, \u201ci\u2019ll give you a voice test.\u201d and he put me into a little studio with a microphone like this", "and he gave me a news analysis to read", "and that\u2019s the first time i ever \u2013 and i read it", "and he said, \u201cwell, you have a nice voice", "and we have a lot of change over here", "we\u2019re very small", "we don\u2019t pay a lot", "if you want to hang around and watch the announcers work and watch how they get the news, if an opening happens, we\u2019ll give you a shot.\u201d so, i hung around for maybe three or four weeks", "i stayed there day and night", "i watched the announcers", "i watched them rip and read", "i would go out with sunny hirsch when he did sports interviews", "i just was taking it all in", "and one day, a friday, marshal simmons, the general manager, called me, and he says, \u201cwell, tom bayer is leaving.\u201d tom bayer was an unusual situation", "he made $55.00 a week, and his alimony was $60.00 a week", "he figured out once that he could not make it on this", "he used to live off coconuts, coconuts from trees", "so, he says, \u201cyou start monday morning", "you\u2019re on from 9:00 to 12:00 in the morning, and in the afternoon, you\u2019ll do news and sports.\u201d so, you got your whole weekend to prepare for this now", "i went crazy", "the whole weekend i had", "i went back home", "i came back to the radio station saturday morning, started picking out the music i\u2019m going to play, hung around there all saturday", "sunday practiced, went into the little studio, good morning, good morning", "this record, les elgart, swinging down the lane", "i\u2019m so excited", "now, it\u2019s monday morning, may 1, 1957", "i get there like 6:00", "i go on at 9:00", "my uncle hugs me and wishes me the best", "it was a warm, muggy, sunny, miami beach morning, 840 first street right opposite the police station", "i would visit there last year, by the way", "it\u2019s another station now", "but, anyway, i walk in", "there\u2019s a secretary that comes in at about 8:00", "i say hello to the all night guy, stack up my records, i\u2019m ready to play", "and then, marshal simmons says, \u201ccome into my office,\u201d at like 8:45", "and i go in", "and he goes, \u201cwell, this is your first day on the air", "the best of luck to you.\u201d and i said, \u201cthank you.\u201d and he said, \u201cwhat name are you going to use?\u201d i said, \u201cwhat are you talking about?\u201d and he goes, \u201cwell, larry zeiger,\u201d that was my name, \u201cain\u2019t going to work.\u201d now, it would work", "now, any name would go", "engelbert humperdinck, any name would go", "so, he says, \u201czeiger won\u2019t work", "it\u2019s a little too ethnic, and people won\u2019t know how to spell it", "and we got to change your name.\u201d and i said, \u201ci\u2019m going on the air in 12 minutes.\u201d and he said, \u201cyeah,\u201d and he had the miami herald open, and i would later write a column for them", "all of these things are like miracles", "and there was an ad for king\u2019s wholesale liquors on washington avenue", "so, he looks down at that ad \u2013 he looked, and he said, \u201chow about larry king?\u201d and i said, \u201cokay, sounds good.\u201d a year later, we legally changed, and it\u2019s legally changed in aftra", "so, if you\u2019re a broadcaster today at an aftra station, even if your name is larry king, you can\u2019t use larry king because it\u2019s a branded name", "yeah, it\u2019s true", "and then, it becomes where you become famous, no one can ever use it", "no one could be arthur godfrey or jackie gleason, even if your name is jackie gleason", "if you get a television show, you can\u2019t be jackie gleason on an aftra station", "anyway, so, now, i got a new name", "now, i go in", "i\u2019m about to go on the air", "at 9:00, i start the record [humming and singing]", "i lower the record, put on the microphone, and nothing comes out", "nothing comes out of your mouth", "nothing", "i bring the record back up, lower it down, bring it back up, lower it down, and i am panicked", "i am sweating", "i\u2019m looking at the clock", "and i literally said to myself i can\u2019t do it", "i can do a lot of things, but i\u2019m nervous, and my whole career is done", "and marshal simmons, god rest him, kicked open the door to the control room and said, \u201cthis is a communications business, damn it, communication.\u201d he closed the door", "i turned down the record, put the mic on and said, \u201cgood morning", "my name is larry king", "and that\u2019s the first time i\u2019ve ever said that because i\u2019ve just been given this name.\u201d \u201cand let me tell you, this is my first day ever on the air", "and all of my life, i dreamed of this", "when i was 5 years old, i would imitate announcers.\u201d the story i just told you, i told the radio audience that day", "my father died, i had to \u2013 and i\u2019m nervous", "i was very nervous here", "so, please bear with me", "i played the record and was never nervous again", "and later in life, that story, i would tell it to arthur godfrey, jackie gleason, and others", "and they said, \u201cwell, you learned the secret of this business, which is there\u2019s no secret", "be yourself.\u201d so, what i did that day, i wasn\u2019t brilliant, i wasn\u2019t conceiving this, carried through me for 60 years, which is be yourself", "don\u2019t be afraid to ask a question", "don\u2019t be afraid to sound stupid", "what did that teach you about honesty", "and not just honesty", "yeah, it teaches you a lot about being open and honest on the air", "but, of course, what you do when you do that is you bring the audience into your circumstance", "and when you do that, if they like you, you win them", "if they don\u2019t like you, they\u2019re not going to like you anyway", "you can\u2019t make them like you", "i asked edward bennett williams, the great criminal defense lawyer, once what\u2019s the no", "1 role of a criminal defense lawyer", "and he said, \u201cput one juror in my client\u2019s shoes.\u201d how would that play out", "if you can put one client in your client\u2019s shoes, he\u2019ll never vote guilty because he would say i would have done that", "all right", "so, what i did that day was put the audience in my shoes", "and i recommend that", "i\u2019ve done a book, how to talk to anyone, anytime, anywhere", "i do a course", "if you\u2019re going to be \u2013 your first public speech", "you\u2019re scared", "get up and tell them you\u2019re scared", "they would understand because they\u2019d be scared, too", "bring them into your situation", "i was on the air when we had the earthquake here", "i was on television, cnn, there were cameras bouncing around", "i\u2019m broadcasting the earthquake", "we\u2019re having an earthquake", "desks are flying", "i\u2019m over there, \u201ci hope we\u2019re still on", "if we\u2019re still on,\u201d you know what i mean", "i was in the station alone during a hurricane", "and i broadcasted the hurricane", "for example, we were out of money", "it was a cigarette machine and a candy machine", "it was just me and the engineer in the station alone", "no one could get there", "i broke the machine on the air", "they heard you breaking into the machine", "yeah", "of course, i told them my situation", "i got no cigarettes, and i got no food", "i said, \u201cyou want to hear what a hurricane sounds like?\u201d we were the only station in the city, wiod, with a generator", "an emergency generator, we were the only thing on the air", "you had to tune to us", "so, i would go outside, lean the microphone out the window, and say, \u201chere\u2019s what it sounds like.\u201d and i broadcast the hurricane", "i just ate it up, yeah", "this is the power of storytelling what you\u2019re talking about", "yeah", "well, the power is i was always good at that", "when i was a kid, they called me zeke like short for larry zeiger", "i was zeke the creek the mouthpiece because i would, as herby said, i would go to a two hour baseball game and come back and tell the guys about it and take two hours", "in other words, i was descriptive", "i always had the ability", "i thought i would be a baseball announcer", "that was my goal to be a sports announcer because i knew i could describe things well in front of me", "do you think that\u2019s a learned skill?\u00a0or is that something that you just had inside of you", "i have no idea", "i think you can teach certain things", "you can\u2019t teach a good voice", "i never had a voice lesson", "i had laryngitis maybe once in the 60 years", "i\u2019ve worked sick", "when i had a heart attack, i was only off the air 10 days", "i think one of the reasons for my longevity is the love of what i do", "in other words, i may have an unhappy day at home", "things may not go right", "i can\u2019t control \u2013 but when that light goes on, i control my environment", "and then, how many people get to control their environment", "so, when i hosted a radio show every night or television show every day or wrote a column, i controlled the question i would ask", "i controlled my environment", "it\u2019s interesting you say that because when i was thinking of doing the podcast, one of the things that scared me was, as a writer all of those years, i had control of the content", "and i can do an interview, but, afterwards, i could piece it together to create the story in the best way possible", "when you\u2019re doing an interview, certainly, that\u2019s live, you don\u2019t have that", "correct", "and so, i was going to have to give that up in order to do this", "you\u2019ve got to trust yourself", "if you trust yourself, if you say to yourself \u2013 i have never said to myself, \u201ccan i ask this?\u201d i asked it", "i never doubted myself", "i don\u2019t have it in social circumstances", "i don\u2019t have it in life", "i don\u2019t have command of situations", "but i trusted myself because i loved it", "if you love communicating \u2013 a lot of writers aren\u2019t good broadcasters", "a lot of them are terrible broadcasters", "yeah", "because they\u2019re used to the comfort of the control on the typewriter, and they write it", "if they only said to themselves, you know, i control this, too, i control it, you do control it", "you\u2019re controlling this podcast right now", "not me, you", "you know, the interesting thing, and maybe we can set this story up together because it reminded me of a story that al pacino tells that goes back to the godfather", "and i know you\u2019re good friends with him, and you\u2019ve heard about his arc through that beginning where, in the very beginning \u2013 they were going to throw him off", "yeah", "do you want to tell a little about that, and then, i\u2019ll take it up to a point where he knew that the godfather was going to be great", "and it speaks to this, what we\u2019re talking about", "i\u2019m trying to remember", "i got so many memories", "all right", "so, al started, and he wasn\u2019t i think the top draft choice of the studio brass", "they wanted robert redford", "they went along with it", "and then, in the beginning, he was having a hard time grasping the part", "and then, i believe it was, at a point where they were thinking of getting rid of him, and he did that famous scene where he goes into the bathroom to get the gun \u2013 get the gun to kill the cop", "that\u2019s right", "and he throws the gun away, which was his idea, and he had the confidence", "and they kept him", "that\u2019s exactly it", "and so, later on, the movie is proceeding, and they\u2019re doing the scene where the godfather is going to be buried", "and everybody works through the scene all day", "at 6:00, everybody is going home", "they\u2019re all walking away", "and al is about to leave", "and he looks over, and he sees francis ford coppola sitting on a grave stone weeping", "and he walks over", "and francis is balling, and he says, \u201cfrancis, francis, what\u2019s wrong", "are you okay?\u201d and coppola says to him, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t give me another set up, meaning the brass wasn\u2019t going to pay for him to be able to shoot it again.\u201d and al knew this guy is going to make a movie here because, if you care that much, and you have that kind of passion \u2013 see, now, i didn\u2019t know that story", "so, you are telling me that story", "i knew the story of they were going to throw him off until he finished that scene", "i know brando, i talked to brando a lot about it", "i know one of the great scenes in the godfather was totally adlibbed by brando", "and that\u2019s the scene right before he dies", "he\u2019s sitting with michael, his son, al, and he\u2019s an old man now", "and the grandson is playing", "that\u2019s where he dies", "he falls over playing with the grandson", "he\u2019s sitting, and the waiter comes by, and the scene was, \u201cdo you want anything else,\u201d and they say, \u201cno,\u201d they both say no, and he dismisses the waiter", "and they keep talking", "the waiter comes by for the scene", "and the waiter says, \u201cdo you want anything else?\u201d and brando, out of nowhere says, \u201ci\u2019ll have some wine.\u201d and he looks at al pacino, and he says, \u201clately, i drink a lot of wine.\u201d oh, man", "but it so fit", "he\u2019s old now", "he\u2019s not the mafia don he once was", "\u201clately, i drink a lot of wine.\u201d and the passion that that must come from, whether you\u2019re al seeing coppola on the grave stone or whether you are in that moment and these words just come out of you, it just seems central to what makes people great", "well, you hit a great word, moment", "and what i\u2019ve tried to do the whole career is be in the moment", "so, i\u2019m always in the moment", "that is, if i\u2019ve interviewed al pacino yesterday and barack obama tomorrow, but i\u2019m interviewing you today, i\u2019m totally into you today", "i\u2019m not thinking about yesterday", "and once the show is over, i never think about it", "i don\u2019t listen to it", "i know what i did", "i don\u2019t have to listen to it", "i don\u2019t have to watch it", "wow", "that\u2019s what i need", "you won\u2019t have to listen to this podcast", "you\u2019ll remember it", "you know what you did", "what are you going to listen for, unless you want to judge it", "i don\u2019t", "i never have, in my life, listened to myself", "once i\u2019ve done it because i know i\u2019ve been in the moment, i trust \u2013 see, the word is trust", "i don\u2019t trust myself off the air", "and that\u2019s weird", "i made so many mistakes, been in debt, many marriages", "life didn\u2019t always work out for me", "i tried to be a good father, sometimes was, sometimes wasn\u2019t", "but on the air, no one ever called me in in my whole career to say what did you say yesterday", "well, there was one great story from the first station in miami", "you got to tell this", "it\u2019s my favorite larry king story", "it\u2019s a great story", "it\u2019s a true story", "but management never really reamed me out", "but what happened was i had just started in radio", "i was on the air two months", "i\u2019m working 9:00 to 12:00", "i\u2019m on in the afternoons, and i\u2019m loving every second of it", "i can\u2019t wait to get there", "i can\u2019t wait to be on", "god, i loved it", "and the general manager, marshal simmons, called me in and said, \u201cal fox, the all night guy, is sick tonight", "would you do the all night show?\u201d and i said, \u201csure.\u201d he said, \u201cwell, you\u2019ll be here alone.\u201d very small station", "\u201cwe don\u2019t have an engineer at night", "you just record the meter readings, play music and talk, and you\u2019re on from midnight to 6:00", "and then, you\u2019ll hang around, and you\u2019ll be on again at 9:00 and then, get some rest.\u201d \u201coh, sure.\u201d now, i\u2019m alone in the station", "i\u2019m playing records, and i\u2019m talking to people", "we talk about the time and the weather and what\u2019s going on in the world because i\u2019m living every minute of this", "and the phone rings, and i pick it up, and i say, \u201cwahr.\u201d and this woman, i could tell you the truth, cal, i can almost hear it now", "this sexy woman voice says, \u201ci want you.\u201d remember, i\u2019m 22 years old", "i think the pimples on my face are from hershey bars", "i am a jew in heat", "and this girl \u2013 no one has ever said to me i want you", "and i suddenly said to myself, there are more than two benefits to being in this business", "so, i said, \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d she says, \u201ccome over", "come over my house.\u201d i said, \u201ci\u2019m on the air", "i get off at 6:00", "i\u2019ll be over at 6:00.\u201d she says, \u201ci only live 10 blocks away", "and i have to go to work at 6:00", "so, it\u2019s now or never.\u201d \u201chere\u2019s my address", "try to come over.\u201d i got this moral dilemma now", "my career, my radio, or no one has ever said i want you", "so, here\u2019s what the radio audience heard", "\u201cladies and gentlemen, i\u2019m just filling in tonight", "so, i\u2019m going to give you a particularly good time here", "i\u2019m going to play the entire harry belafonte at carnegie hall album uninterrupted.\u201d i had 23 minutes, which is all the time i needed, and which is still true to this day", "anyway, i put the record on", "we didn\u2019t have tapes then", "it was an actual record", "zoom out to the car, drive out to her house, there\u2019s the car she described it in the driveway", "i pulled into the house, the light is on", "over to the door, i go in", "there\u2019s a little, dark room, and there\u2019s this woman in a white negligee sitting on the couch", "she opens her arms", "i grab her", "i pulled her around", "my cheek is against her cheek", "and she\u2019s got the radio on", "and i\u2019m hearing harry belafonte and he says \u2013 he\u2019s singing jamaica farewell", "and he sings,

people calling in", "i\u2019m totally embarrassed", "i\u2019m picking up, i\u2019m apologizing to people", "and the last caller was an older jewish man", "and i just said, \u201cwahr, good morning.\u201d and all i hear was, \u201cwhere the nights, where the nights, where the nights", "i\u2019m going crazy with where the nights.\u201d i said, \u201cgee, i\u2019m sorry", "why didn\u2019t you just change the station?\u201d and he said, \u201ci\u2019m an invalid, and i\u2019m in bed", "and a nurse takes care me", "she leaves at night", "she sets it to your station", "the radio is up on the bureau", "i can\u2019t reach it", "i\u2019m stuck.\u201d and i said, \u201cgee, can i do anything for you?\u201d he says, \u201cyeah, play [inaudible].\u201d but i didn\u2019t get fired for that", "another thing that i almost got fired, and i don\u2019t know if you even know this story, cal", "i had to make a living, so, i was making like $60.00 a week from the radio station", "and i was doing \u2013 when i first started on television, i was making $100.00 from that", "and i was also the announcer at the dog track", "there goes rusty, miami beach dog track", "it was right near joe\u2019s stone crabs", "i used to walk in, look into joe\u2019s stone crabs window, and say, \u201ci wonder if i can ever eat there.\u201d anyway, i was doing three jobs", "and this was new year\u2019s eve", "so, i taped the television show, did my radio show, and did the dog track", "now, the next morning, i\u2019m on", "i think it was on that shift, i was on 8:00 to 12:00 or 8:00 to 11:00, whatever it was", "so, i\u2019m dead tired", "and it\u2019s new year\u2019s morning", "no one at the station", "and it\u2019s a news station, wkat", "and there\u2019s big window doors leading in where you could look up and see the announcer in the station", "and i\u2019m so tired", "and i\u2019m just playing music and talking", "and oh, my god, please", "and 9:00, don mcneil and the breakfast club goes on", "that\u2019s a show from chicago", "it\u2019s an hour every day, syndicated", "good morning, breakfast lovers and howdy do ya", "at the 9:30 point in that show, don mcneil would say we\u2019ll be back in 30 seconds", "this is the abc radio network", "and all i had to do was turn off that mic, turn on my mic and say this is wkat, the big cat in miami beach, and switch that switch back on and go back to chicago and turn mine off", "well, what i did was, he said, \u201cthis is the abc radio network.\u201d and i turned him off, turned my mic on, and fell asleep", "oh, man", "no, i\u2019m the only one in the station, and i\u2019m snoring like this", "anyway, all people at home hear is [snoring]", "so, they panic", "somebody called the miami beach police department, and the fire department comes", "they look in the window, and they see a guy slumped against the microphone", "and they figure i\u2019m dead", "so, they take hatchets and break their way in through the window", "and as they

on the air", "and i look up, and it\u2019s like 9:45", "and i say, \u201cnow, back to the breakfast club with don mcneil.\u201d and the general manager of the station, frank catzentine, called me in",

said", "i never cursed on the air", "i never said something that would bring me into repute", "i just was \u2013 i loved the radio", "and then, now, i\u2019m on the internet", "and people curse on the internet", "i\u2019ve had guests say the f word", "i still can\u2019t", "i can\u2019t bring myself to do it because i\u2019m so cognizant of the microphone and the old rules", "well, first thing, are we hearing biscuit the dog snoring", "that\u2019s fine", "i\u2019m just taking larry\u2019s advice here and just describing what\u2019s going on", "biscuit snores", "you can take him and put him in another room", "he don\u2019t care", "he\u2019s 8 years old now", "he\u2019s just an old dog", "that adds to the \u2013 see, here\u2019s the beauty of the podcast", "that\u2019s right", "now, they know biscuit", "right", "in the old days, you would have been signaling the guy to try to get him to take the \u2013 cut that, cut that, watch that, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t \u2013 what the hell", "biscuit was snoring, if you heard the sound", "if you didn\u2019t hear it, okay, that\u2019s what he cut for", "if you did hear it, it\u2019s cute", "and tim has got a dog, molly, who he often

talk a little about curiosity, about speaking, listening, empathy", "you are one of the most curious people i\u2019ve ever met", "is that something that is engrained", "or is it something that everybody has but somehow, you never lost", "good question, cal", "that\u2019s why the fussman factor podcast will be a success", "truthfully, i don\u2019t know", "i was always curious", "i remember, as an 8-year-old or 9-year-old, i\u2019d get on the bus and ask the bus driver why do you want to drive a bus", "my curiosity was endless", "so, it lent me into a broadcast booth that worked for me", "that worked for me", "my curiosity worked for me", "i never got good grades in school, except in things with oral projects like english where i could ask questions of the teacher", "so, i always had that curiosity and managed to find a work place that brought it to me", "i don\u2019t know the answer to that, but i could give you rules", "sure, what are rules", "listen", "listening is as important as what you\u2019re asking", "so, don\u2019t worry about your next question", "now, that\u2019s risk taking, but don\u2019t worry about your next question", "often, you see, when people are in conversation, you can almost look at somebody carefully and see they\u2019re thinking about what they\u2019re going to say next", "now, that is natural", "i react", "you can\u2019t tell someone just starting", "so, someone just starting, if it\u2019s comfortable for you to make little notes to yourself so you have a bridge to fall back on, do it", "you want to be good", "but, eventually, get to be where you don\u2019t need those notes", "your curiosity works for you", "and sometimes, the simplest question is the best", "like when we had the first \u2013 the war in kuwait when we went into iraq, we didn\u2019t go to baghdad", "oh, desert storm, right", "we would have generals on every night and reporters", "and i would hear people out of other stations, \u201cthis happened today and this happened.\u201d my first question was what happened today", "okay", "now, i\u2019m getting their perspective of what happened today", "now, based on their answer, i\u2019ll have to have another question, and i would", "whatever the answer was, even if it was today, the troops advanced 10 miles into the enemy territory", "that\u2019s the answer", "okay", "did that surprise you", "there you go", "here we go, go right with it", "why did they do that", "do you trust the information that your superiors give you", "there\u2019s so many things like i watch interviews today, they\u2019re nuts", "people are terrible, especially after sporting events", "what\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve seen", "i see it every day", "we have just seen a sporting event", "a guy just got his first major league homerun to win the game", "one stupid question i saw was this was your first major league game", "it was the ninth inning", "the count was 2 and 1, and you hit that homerun to right field", "and they put the mic in front of them", "what\u2019s the question", "there\u2019s no question", "or the second dumbest question", "you got a home run and you\u2019re first at bat", "what does it feel like", "he\u2019s going to answer, terrible", "i didn\u2019t to hit a homerun", "i wanted to strike out", "i would go other areas like when you played little league, what were some of your baseball dreams", "and he might say to play in my first game", "did you ever visualize hitting a homerun", "what were you thinking when you were on deck?\u00a0were your parents here", "and not only are these unexpected questions, but they\u2019re easily answered", "yes, my parents were here or no, they weren\u2019t", "and then, feeling with them, talk to them", "in other words, put yourself \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of how would you be in that situation, except you don\u2019t have to refer to yourself", "you don\u2019t have to say i would have done", "i don\u2019t use the word i", "i ask questions because i\u2019m an observer", "i\u2019m present at the creation", "i like to be there", "again it\u2019s the moment", "i like to be in the moment", "can what you do be used by anybody in their office", "i would guess so", "i do a course based on the book how to talk to anyone anytime, anywhere", "i\u2019ve had some successful people tell me that the book helped them in their life", "it\u2019s still in print", "i saw it in norway", "yes, you can because, in a communicating world, now, the big difference today is, with modern technology, it\u2019s probably easier today to text",

in their hands looking down", "terrible", "what do we lose when we no longer have eye contact with people", "intimacy", "that\u2019s what i want in every show i do, an intimate relationship with the guest", "if i can establish that like sinatra, i\u2019ve got a letter here sinatra wrote to me after his last television interview", "you make the camera disappear", "intimacy, trust", "if the guest will trust you, you\u2019re home because they know you\u2019re sincerely interested in them", "and, therefore, you could go anywhere", "you can go anywhere", "it depends how you phrase the question, how you feel", "but if you could put yourself in their shoes and get their emotion, it\u2019s a good tip", "nobody thinks they\u2019re bad", "nobody", "hitler didn\u2019t comb his hair in the morning

kind of first question is, if i were interviewing osama bin laden, the stupidest first question would be why did you kill 3,000 people on that september day in new york", "i would have asked him, \u201cyou grew up in the richest family in saudi arabia", "why did you leave?\u201d now, that gets him to think", "but what he didn\u2019t think about why he left that day", "but now \u2013 you\u2019ve made him curious about himself", "right", "but he also knows i\u2019m sincerely curious about him", "i have made no judgment in that question", "i don\u2019t bring an agenda", "what do we want", "we want to learn", "all we want is information", "we why to know the whys of osama bin laden", "wouldn\u2019t that help you understand, when you\u2019re dealing with the osama bin laden of the future, why do you want to know", "all we want is \u2013 i remember once, i had this great guy on, swami satchidananda", "i never forgot him, from india", "and he was so calm about everything", "and he was the kind of guy, i remember he said, \u201cwhen you wake up in the morning, when you open your eyes, did you deserve that day", "whether you believe in god or whatever, did larry \u2013 did the swami deserve this day?\u201d you woke up, it\u2019s a gift", "you don\u2019t know where it came from", "it\u2019s a gift, the gift of life", "you woke up", "so, what if it\u2019s raining", "you\u2019ve got the gift of the day", "so, what if the toast is burnt", "make more toast", "you\u2019ve got the gift", "i said to him, \u201cswami, what if i told you i\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow at 3:00, take you to the airport, and i don\u2019t show", "what would you do?\u201d \u201ci would call you and say, larry, how are you", "i know something terrible must have happened because you weren\u2019t there", "the shoe is on your foot.\u201d then, i asked him the world\u2019s greatest question", "\u201cokay, swami,\u201d i was being cute, \u201cyou come home, walk up into your bedroom, and your wife is in bed with another guy.\u201d and he said to me, \u201cwhat would you do?\u201d and i said, \u201ci would scream and yell, and that\u2019s what everyone would do", "scream and yell",

this is very embarrassing, you two", "i\u2019m going to go down and make some tea", "why don\u2019t the both of you come down to breakfast then", "let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d who owns that moment", "you\u2019re in control", "yeah", "that\u2019s the hardest thing to do", "but, basically, that\u2019s what i would do on the air", "why are you doing this", "why are you doing that", "my curiosity would be there no matter what the situation", "and, eventually, i would be asking osama bin laden why did he send those people out that day in september", "the more you\u2019re talking, the more i\u2019m seeing the power of control in questions", "it\u2019s all control", "for most of my life in this great business, i have controlled my environment when working", "and, for a lot of time, when i did my national radio show, i did the first national network show, i was on from midnight to 5:00", "i was on cnn from 9:00 to 10:00", "i wrote a weekly column in usa today", "when i was writing the column, when i was on the radio for five hours, and when i was on television for the hour, i control all of that", "so, people could, actually, use what you were doing to gain a better control over their own lives, even if it\u2019s not in broadcasting, just the use of the questions, like the swami said", "unfortunately, i don\u2019t do as well in the personal life", "everyone has their \u2013 a lot of comedians are very unhappy people", "right", "and they see things funny for an escape from their own reality", "so, i do very well in this circumstance sitting here talking to you", "but i couldn\u2019t hang a picture well", "i\u2019d hit my thumb", "i\u2019m not a \u2013 i try to be a good driver", "i\u2019m not a great driver", "in other words, no one is perfect", "but in areas where you can, especially in the work environment, where you can control something, yeah, i could teach you how to do it", "what about empathy", "because that seems to be a quality that you have", "you can listen to anybody, and you\u2019re making them feel \u2013 i\u2019m not judgmental", "right", "that i learned from broadcasting", "what am i going to judge", "i\u2019m there to learn", "let the audience \u2013 see, the audience makes up its own mind", "i\u2019m a conduit from me to you", "i learn, and through me, you learn", "but i don\u2019t make a judgment call", "in other words, i\u2019m not the kind of broadcaster who argues with the guest", "it\u2019s just not my style", "i am passionate politically, off the air", "but i felt at best as a broadcaster that my role as a journalist was to give you \u2013 at the end of an hour, and you knew more the hour before", "when there\u2019s arguing, you don\u2019t learn", "i don\u2019t like broadcasts where the guy just stands on a soapbox and talks for an hour", "well, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any empathy on tv anymore", "that\u2019s gone", "the day of the long form interview is kind of gone", "it\u2019s sad", "actually, it seems like the podcast is one way of trying to \u2013 that\u2019s the last venue of the long form interview", "this could not occur on television today", "what you\u2019re doing right now could not occur", "for a radio station, it would be rare because, today, people want eat it up, speed it up, get it out", "it\u2019s a spit it out business", "get it up, get it out", "can\u2019t get enough, get right through it", "today, the rules are you do an interview show today, the guest should be on tops 10 minutes", "you don\u2019t want a half hour interview today", "they\u2019re going to tune out because they\u2019ve got 500 channels", "and you can\u2019t \u2013 and i think technology has added \u2013 what are we losing", "knowledge", "so, we\u2019re not getting the information",

learn more from it every day than i get from all of cable television", "and they\u2019ve got cameras", "new york times doesn\u2019t", "but they can write an in depth article that continues on page 46", "and i get more out of it", "the sad thing is that newspapers are going away", "that\u2019s all part of \u2013 technology brings improvements, and they bring bad things, too", "when i spoke in

cancer, this brilliant scientist", "another guy is writing a great play", "and another guy is inventing a new kind of airplane that will exceed the speed of sound", "and another guy is planning how to build a nuclear weapon that you can hide in your hands and get on a plane", "he\u2019s doing that, too", "so, the guy who is curing cancer, he\u2019s going to succeed", "but the guy with the bomb is going to succeed, too", "so, this is what you face as we advance as a culture", "we advance", "remember, the small grocer got overtaken", "i liked the small grocer", "i liked the guy who took the little pencil who added up on the paper bag and took the clipper and got the toilet paper down from the top of the rack", "that\u2019s gone", "the interesting thing to me though is that it seems like questions are becoming more important now because, in this age of technology, you can google any answer", "a 6-year-old can google any answer to any question in 4 seconds", "but the right question, no", "that 6-year-old might not be able to come up with it", "ask more", "go through a day, and see how many people ask questions rather than say things", "my motto, my broadcast motto all of my life was i never learned anything when i was talking", "and that\u2019s interesting because you see tv and the idea is just to talk over somebody to get your point \u2013 now, at times, you have to", "for example, if i\u2019m speaking, if you speak, as you do, and i\u2019m making a comment in front of a group, of course", "i\u2019m not learning anything", "but i\u2019m entertaining", "that\u2019s different", "you can entertain", "if i\u2019m telling a joke, i know the end of the joke", "so, i\u2019m not learning anything, but i\u2019m providing entertainment", "if i\u2019m making a speech, i\u2019m not learning anything, but i\u2019m providing knowledge", "but if i\u2019m a questioner, i never learned anything when i was talking", "if i\u2019m asking a question of you, it better be a question not a statement, not a history lesson", "ask the question", "so many people, i want to yell sometimes is what\u2019s the question", "i hear what you\u2019re saying", "is there advice that you would give young people to better ask questions", "i\u2019ll sit down before an interview, and i\u2019ll write out maybe 200 questions i want to ask", "if that\u2019s what works for you", "never do what doesn\u2019t work for you", "so, if larry king says don\u2019t wrote out questions in advance that would be stupid for me to say", "i don\u2019t do it", "i can\u2019t tell you what to do", "whatever is your comfort zone", "is there something about the foundation of i did these speeches, change your questions, change your life, to look at questions a different way, to look at the power in them", "step aside from where you are", "look at yourself and see how a different question could change your position", "is this something that you have done", "or you\u2019re just constantly in the moment", "i never sat down and figured it out", "i\u2019m just in the moment", "i didn\u2019t do self analysis", "i\u2019m in the moment", "but i know that listening is as important as asking", "listening is as important as what you ask because follow up is", "you have to be in the moment", "is there advice", "is there ways for people to improve their listening", "i guess", "in this modern age of technology where you have instant information and where you can text people, listen is a weird word", "think about the word listen", "what are you listening to today", "you\u2019re reading stuff off your little iphone", "and often, people have their ears plugged to take in what they want to hear", "so, they\u2019re pushing away the outside", "i\u2019ll tell you, often, how people don\u2019t listen", "we can test it", "i did this with jim bishop one day", "in miami, he did a column on this", "when you see someone that you know and pass on the street, how you doing", "right", "i say i\u2019ve got brain cancer", "how is the wife", "because they don\u2019t listen", "how are you doing", "they don\u2019t want to know how you\u2019re doing", "don\u2019t stop", "how am i doing",

a way to break through that sort of cocktail party banter that means nothing", "now, this i don\u2019t know the answer to", "i have always had people respond to me", "and it\u2019s worked with women", "so, you just get genuine, sincere responses", "yeah", "and as george burns said, \u201cif you can fake that, you got it made.\u201d but i have always known, in interview situations, i\u2019ve always known that i can get people to respond to me", "so, i could use humor", "i could use \u2013 but they know that i really want to know what they\u2019re thinking and why they did what they did", "and people appreciate that", "i don\u2019t know anybody that doesn\u2019t like to talk about what they did, except brando who didn\u2019t like to talk about acting", "but that can be useful to anybody in any situation, in the office \u2013 of course", "just by looking into somebody and being \u2013 being sincere and zeroing in", "right", "there\u2019s two questions you ask in the same quest", "why did you do that", "or why did you do that", "you\u2019re going to get a better answer with the second", "right", "i was doing some reading, and they say that, when you take in a question, 10 percent is only the words, 30 percent is the tone of voice, what you just illustrated", "tone is very important, which you don\u2019t get with your iphone", "and 60 percent is the body language behind that question", "which you don\u2019t get with your iphone", "yeah", "and so, i guess this is something people can work on, if they want to, to learn how to better communicate", "yeah", "well, we\u2019re trying all of the time", "how to talk to anyone anytime, anywhere", "how to be better \u2013 we all want to do better", "you\u2019re always learning", "and you always accept the fact that you\u2019re still learning", "if you\u2019re in sales, you got to connect with people", "if you\u2019re a leader of a company, you got to connect with people", "and, basically, they can use the same skills that

is the ferriss wheel question", "we\u2019ve been going a long time here, cal", "okay", "it didn\u2019t feel that way to me", "well, we\u2019ve been over an hour", "i don\u2019t want to break it to you, cal, but you\u2019re starting to get annoying", "and i want to tell you, listeners", "this is going to be a great podcast", "but there does hit a point with the fussman factor where he gets annoying", "and we\u2019re very close to that point now", "yes, what questions does the ferriss wheel want", "this is from tim", "if you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere, what would it say and

reactions", "for example, my son, chance, who is 18 hated holden caulfield, thought he was a pompous, spoiled brat", "i never saw him that way, didn\u2019t find him funny", "it\u2019s interesting the way kids \u2013 that perspective", "that\u2019s good writing", "if you can react hostilely to it", "yeah", "and 50 years from now, he may have a very different look at it", "right", "for example, you
