I\u2019m at home for the holidays and in this episode, like every episode, it is my job to try to tease out the habits, routines, and specifics from world-class performers so that you can test them and apply them in your own lives. This is a special edition because the audio is coming from a live performance \u2013 although I\u2019m not sure you would call it performance \u2013 a conversation collection of grab-assing and insightful, hopefully, answers from my guests at the 92Y, 92nd Street Y, in New York City. It was my first live podcast event on the east coast and we had a blast. The guests are three-fold: we have two favorites that you guys have loved in the past. One of those is Josh Waitzkin, best known as the inspiration and the basis for Searching for Bobby Fisher. He\u2019s thought of as a chess prodigy but he has a framework and approach that he has applied to several different fields to become world champion in push-hands among other things. He now works with a lot of the top people in the finance world. We have Ramit Sethi. And Josh can be found at joshwaitzkin.com. He very rarely crawls out of his cave but he joined us on this occasion. Ramit Sethi, @Ramit on both the Twitters and Instagram, he is the, I suppose you can call him, personal finance guru who has built a huge company out of his blog which started way back in the day and he is the best spelling author of I Will Teach You to Be Rich and also has a site by the same name. And then we have a new guest who is Adam Robinson. He\u2019s very close friends with Josh Waitzkin. And where should we begin? Well, you can learn about him at robinsonglobalstrategies.com but, check this out: look at this bio. Alright, so Adam has made a lifelong study of outflanking the competition. It began with acting as the co-founder \u2013 one of the two cofounders \u2013 of The Princeton Review. So he developed a revolutionary approach to taking standardized tests and his book became the first ever based on test prep to be reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and become a New York Times Best Seller. After selling his interest in that company, he turned his attention to the then-emerging field of artificial intelligence \u2013 this was in the early \u201990s \u2013 and he developed a program that could analyze text and provide human-like commentary. He was later invited to join a well-known quant fund \u2013 this is in world investing \u2013 to develop statistical trading models. And then, following that and currently, he is an independent global macro adviser to the chief investment officers of a select group of the world\u2019s largest hedge funds as well as family offices. And he has a degree from Wharton, he has a Master\u2019s degree from Oxford University, and, not only that, he is a rated chessmaster who was awarded a life title by the United States Chess Federation and, as a teenager, he was personally mentored by Bobby Fisher in the 18 months leading up to his winning the world championships. So it seems like it\u2019s too incredible to be non-fiction but that is Adam and he is hilarious. So I think you guys will really enjoy those three guests. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and I must mention that the live event was helped by MeUndies and XO Protein. They provided all sorts of goodies to the attendees. So check out some of my favorite underwear and lounge pants \u2013 I\u2019m wearing them right now, in fact \u2013 at meundies.com/tim. And you can check out XO Protein. These are the only bars that I eat these days and I like them so much that I ended up becoming an investor and an advisor to the company. No soy, no dairy, no gluten but Paleo, 10 grams of protein, and real food \u2013 you can check it out. It is based on cricket protein of all things which is about as pure and unadulterated as you can get with full-spectrum protein. So check it out at xoexoprotein.com. And, without further ado, please enjoy this conversation with Josh, Ramit, and Adam. [Intro music] So you guys may be familiar with the esteemed Mr. Waitzkin. I\u2019ll give a little bit of context for those who might not know him and then I\u2019ll let him correct me. Well, many people think of him as a chess prodigy. If you\u2019ve read or seen Searching for Bobby Fisher, it\u2019s very much based on his life. Although I don\u2019t think the word prodigy applies to Josh insomuch as he really has an extremely methodical and conscious approach to learning and mastery. And he\u2019s applied that to Tai Chi Push Hands in which he is a world champion. He\u2019s applied it to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu \u2013 first black belt right, under Marcelo Garcia who is the phenom, probably the most successful grappler who\u2019s ever lived. And I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. He works with a lot of top performers and we\u2019ll get into that, I\u2019m sure. Ramit, where should we begin? It starts a long time ago with the long walks on the beach \u2013 both of us \u2013 and turned a blog, way back in the day, into one of the most successful destinations and resources for personal finance and very much more than that. He has a hugely successful company and has been featured in, was it, Fortune in a spread right alongside to Warren Buffett \u2013 that\u2019s pretty good company. And, Adam, I think I\u2019m going to leave the introduction for Adam, our mystery guest, to Josh to give just a little bit of context on who Adam is. Josh Waitzkin: Okay. Timbo, it\u2019s great to be here with you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Thanks for coming. Josh Waitzkin: And Adam is a dear friend of mine. My 5-year-old son, Jack, would say he\u2019s a closer friend with him which\u2026 He\u2019s a beautiful human being. Adam, back in the day in the 1960\u2019s, was a chessmaster. He\u2019s still a chessmaster but that was when he was really actively playing chess. Adam Robinson: A little after that. Josh Waitzkin: After that? And then he was close friends with Bobby Fisher, for better or worse, in the \u201960s, \u201970s so really in the center of the chess world back then. Then Adam founded The Princeton Review so he\u2019s one of the most fascinating educational minds. He\u2019s written ten educational books and I\u2019ve watched Adam just work with my little boy and with so many people in education. He\u2019s a brilliant mind around the learning process. And then Adam took his kind of unique versatile mind and applied it to macroeconomics and that\u2019s the world in which he and I met a number of years ago. And Adam is a consultant with some of the \u2013 I can\u2019t say their names because confidentiality\u2019s a huge part of what Adam does \u2013 but some of the most brilliant and well-known names in the finance industry. He\u2019s an incredibly brilliant thinker in a lot of fields. And I love the guy \u2013 he\u2019s a really beautiful human. Tim Ferriss: He will charm all of you with his charisma. He just captures the room. He tried to pinch Ramit\u2019s nipples earlier. [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: Wait a second. Wait a second. It\u2019s not the way it sounds. [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: That\u2019s a welcome approach. [00:10:03] Tim Ferriss: No, this is a common greeting where he\u2019s from as I\u2019ve been told. [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: He and I have safety words so\u2026 Ramit Sethi: Yeah, we do have safety words. Tim Ferriss: And we\u2019re going to get into all sorts of nonsense because that\u2019s kind of my style. But we have a very smart crew here and I thought I would just begin by dumbing it all down. Josh, can you tell us\u2026? Josh game me a warning before we got started. It was a tooth caveat. What\u2019s happening with the tooth? Josh Waitzkin: Be very careful in the things you say to Tim right before he pulls you onto his podcast. I\u2019ve learned that several times. I forgot it this time around. A number of years ago, I was spearfishing \u2013 freediving is something I love. I was spearfishing and it was actually an interesting moment because I had just speared a couple mutton snappers for lunch with my family down in an uninhabited island in the Southern Bahamas. And I was just taking target practice with this kind Hawaiian sling \u2013 it\u2019s like a bow and arrow \u2013 and I was shooting these little shells, 20, 25 feet away, just stroking it. And I reached this realization that, if you barely touch the spear, barely grip it, as you know from bow and arrow, I was just missing by a quarter inch versus longer. And I was in this beautiful zone and then my sister screamed, \u201cJosh!\u201d and there was a big barracuda swimming with her and I thought she was in trouble so I released the wrong side of it. It exploded into my tooth and so I have this wonderful snaggletooth. And I just told Tim right before that it came loose right before now. So I could very easily have a snaggle tooth with a screw hanging out within about 5, 10 minutes of the beginning of this discussion which will add to the flavor of it. I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re talking about that, but there it is. Tim Ferriss: So, for those of you listening on audio only, this is what you miss when you don\u2019t come to a live Tim Ferriss Show. I thought we\u2019d begin \u2013 and, maybe, Adam, we\u2019ll start with you \u2013 we are recording this towards, say, the tail end of a year. How do you think about the transition from one year to the next? Do you have New Year\u2019s resolutions or do you have any particular routines or approaches as you close out a year? Adam Robinson: I try to take stock of what I\u2019ve learned the past year. And I\u2019ve learned three things this year \u2013 and two of which, you exemplify \u2013 and I wish I had known them when I was younger. And I\u2019d like to share them because I think they\u2019re the keys to success and, again, you exemplify them. The first is the importance of enthusiasm with everything that you do \u2013 absolutely everything. The second is the importance of connecting to people. I live in the world of ideas and it\u2019s only this year that I\u2019ve learned the importance of connecting with brothers like you guys. And, the third, this is best illustrated with a metaphor. About 20 years ago, I met the dog who was in The Mask. Do you remember the Jim Carrey movie, The Mask? So \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Was that just a personals ad or\u2026? This was the\u2026? [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: No, I met the dog and his trainer. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, okay. Oh, I got it. Got it. Adam Robinson: Right? Okay, so I met the dog and his trainer and we were walking down the street in New York. And the dog \u2013 so this is a star dog, right, a Hollywood star dog, a little Jack Russell terrier \u2013 and so he was walking down the street and, every time someone passed by, he went like this. And we walked a little further and then\u2026 And I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s so perfect. He expects magic in every encounter.\u201d And I think that\u2019s one of the key things that I\u2019ve learned \u2013 that, if you expect magic in every encounter, you find it like this. I\u2019m really excited for you guys because I know the magic that\u2019s going to happen here with this crew. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned this year. So that\u2019s what I do with my New Year\u2019s. Tim Ferriss: Now, is that something that you ruminate on as an internal dialogue? Is it something you write down? How do you\u2026? Are there any ways in which you attempt to ensure that you continue to pay attention to those things in your\u2026? Adam Robinson: I just try to live it. There\u2019s no\u2026 Expecting magic, again, I picture that little dog, walking down the street, and I lean into every moment expecting magic the way that dog leaned into the person and\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Well, I think we saw that in the green room just before we got\u2026? Right? We\u2019re not going to name names but, to everybody in the room \u2013 even people he hadn\u2019t met \u2013 if he heard their name from far away, he would go, \u201cJack!\u201d and just walk straight up. And the person would be like, \u201cHi,\u201d and then big hug and then thick as thieves right from the get-go. Ramit, what about you? How do you think about the end of years, the beginning of new years? Ramit Sethi: I think about relationships. I think, in the past, it was, \u201cI\u2019m 23, or I\u2019m 25, or I\u2019m 28 \u2013 where am I supposed to be?\u201d And I think, at a certain point, that sort of loses its\u2026 You realize there\u2019s no real roadmap. Right? You\u2019re going to carve out your own path. The thing that became more important for me is, \u201cWho am I meeting? What\u2019s the quality of those relationships?\u201d And so, if it was up to me, I\u2019ll basically sit in my house and work all day long. And that\u2019s just like I love it, that\u2019s what I want to do, and I would just do that for ever. And that\u2019s probably not the healthiest approach to life so I try to force myself to go out, not only maintain the relationships I have, but build new ones, and I think the end of the year is a really good time to take stock. So I actually have a list of every single person I met the whole year \u2013 I have it in a Google doc \u2013 and I just look at it and say, first of all, is this the right level that I want to be doing? If I\u2019ve met five people, that\u2019s not good for me. And, also, is it just making a list or it actually making new friends? Like I said, it would be easy for me to just sit around and just work all day \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So are you then\u2026? Let\u2019s say that you come home, you\u2019ve had a number of meetings that day or that week, and, on a weekly basis, you\u2019re inputting these names? Ramit Sethi: No, I just write it down. I just write down their names \u2013 that\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss: I see. Ramit Sethi: Just so I can go back and look and say, \u201cHey, these are amazing people that I\u2019ve met and now I\u2019m remembering \u2013 I look at it every week \u2013 \u201cOkay, wow. I found this interesting article. I want to send it over.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m going out to the museum. Let me text this person to come hang out.\u201d And it\u2019s just a good reminder for me that the business is the business \u2013 it\u2019s going to grow, this and that \u2013 but the one thing that I want to fight for to make time for is to build those relationships. Tim Ferriss: What would you like to improve upon most \u2013 personally or from a business standpoint \u2013 next year? Ramit Sethi: Oh my god, easy \u2013 easy by a factor of 1,000. It\u2019s becoming a better leader and manager. I feel like, in my business, we get the human psychology part of what we do \u2013 that\u2019s what we do \u2013 but management and leadership is so infinitely complex that I think I could spend the next 20 years just getting good, not even great. Tim Ferriss: How do you think about\u2026? And this might be one that we get to as a group. But management, I think, is relatively easy to grasp. People can envision what that means. What is a good leader? How would you define a good leader or what are the characteristics that distinguish them from someone who is merely a good manager of, say, a team of 50 people or 100 people? Ramit Sethi: Well, first of all, I\u2019m a student so I\u2019m trying to learn that myself but the leaders that I\u2019ve seen, first off, I think they know when to speak up and when not to speak up. It\u2019s almost like a good parent. A good parent knows when to get in there and, \u201cOh, okay, you\u2019re about to fall off a cliff, let me save you but, if you\u2019re just going to fall down on the grass, let me let you make that mistake.\u201d And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m trying to learn which doesn\u2019t come naturally to me. If it were up to me, I want to get in there every minute and that\u2019s not a healthy way, I think, to be a leader. So that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been working on. My team\u2019s been telling me and I have to listen to that. Other leaders, I think, create a vision for where they want to go and it\u2019s more than money and that\u2019s something that I\u2019d like to get better at as well. Tim Ferriss: Well, I want to underscore something you just said because it\u2019s also something I\u2019m trying to get better at \u2013 this letting people fall on the grass. And I don\u2019t recall the exact person this came up with but it was someone who\u2019s in the \u201cB Club\u201d \u2013 billionaire of some type \u2013 and they explained\u2026 Actually, I do remember exactly who it was and it was not somebody, necessarily \u2013 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the \u201cB Club\u201d but he\u2019s certainly very, very successful \u2013 Astro Teller. So he\u2019s the head of X, formerly GoogleX. This is Google\u2019s Moonshot Factory \u2013 I guess now Alphabet\u2019s Moonshot Factory \u2013 where they are working on things like Loon, and contact lenses that can act as glucometers, and all these really incredible bets on the future. And he was describing how, in his organization, people would come to him for conflict resolution and he would make a point of insisting \u2013 even though it would take a lot more time \u2013 that they figure out how to solve it, themselves, because he said, \u201cIf I step in and I solve your conflict, I\u2019m the parent you come to for the quick and easy path \u2013 you will always come to me \u2013 and I need to train you to actually develop the skillset of handling this dispute, this type of conflict, on your own.\u201d What about you, Josh? You\u2019re an introspective guy. You\u2019re very good a blocking out time for deep work \u2013 I think something that I try to emulate to the extent possible when I\u2019m not running around scattershot 24/7. What do the last days of a year and first few days of a year look like or mean to you? Josh Waitzkin: I think that\u2019s a particularly intense question for me right now because I, first of all, just turned 40 a few days ago and I took off for Costa Rica and surfed some big waves on my 40th and I was reflecting on the year quite a bit. And I came extremely close to dying a year ago, as we\u2019ve discussed. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I thought you were going to say again. I was\u2026 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: I was\u2026 No. Just \u2013 [Crosstalk] Ramit Sethi: No. Like there\u2019s a pattern here? Just can I just pause for a second \u2013 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: Although, on the one-wheel, I came really close a couple weeks ago, too, but nothing like this. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: The shallow water blackout? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. And I think most of you have heard me speak about it with Tim on the podcast last time he pulled me onto it but, long story short, I was doing this breath-hold work and cold water immersion work and I made the mistake of doing it in the water. I\u2019ve been a lifetime freediver but not doing hypoxic breath work. And I didn\u2019t know, even though I\u2019d been freediving my whole life, that it is actually carbon dioxide that gave me the urge to breathe because I\u2019d never done breathwork that would actually wipe all the carbon dioxide out of my system. And so I went from this ecstatic state to passing out, blacking out, underwater \u2013 shallow water blackout. And I was in the bottom of the pool for three and a half minutes plus after blacking out before someone pulled me out and all the doctors said 45 to 60 seconds, I should be braindead or dead. So I\u2019ve been reflecting on this year through the lens of that experience and it\u2019s been\u2026 So, as I mentioned to you before, I\u2019ve had this year of just waves of love, gratitude, and beauty flowing through me and I\u2019ve never felt a more powerful dedication to every moment in life and to living life as fully as I can possibly live it. And a core lesson \u2013 you asked about lesson \u2013 for me, that I think about it broadly and across disciplines is how insanely important it is to be focused on the most important question and to know what it is. And, in this situation, I had a technical oversight. I wasn\u2019t present to the most important question which is carbon dioxide is what gives you the urge to breathe. But, when you work with brilliant investors, for example, there\u2019s no better way to train someone than developing their ability to focus on the most important question. It\u2019s the same thing with chess players \u2013 know where to look \u2013 or martial artists \u2013 know where to focus on. The great ones aren\u2019t the ones who focus on more \u2013 they focus on less, actually, and better. And so that lesson for me, which I\u2019ve applied to intellectual and physical disciplines my whole life, I blew it on in this critical moment of my life and so it feels much more potent to me. Tim Ferriss: The most important question in \u201cX\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a project, or challenge, or problem, whatever it might be \u2013 I know that you have a very consistent journaling practice so do you keep that question present so that you don\u2019t make, for instance, mistakes like that? Using journaling or how do you go about ensuring that you don\u2019t miss that most critical thing when you need it most? Josh Waitzkin: Well, as you know, my journaling system is based around studying complexity, reducing the complexity down to \u201cWhat is the most important question?\u201d sleeping on it, and then waking up in the morning, first thing, and pre-input brainstorming on it. So I\u2019m feeding my unconscious material to work on, releasing it completely, and then opening up my mind and riffing on it. And then\u2026 You were going to say something. Tim Ferriss: I was. Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You saw me pursing my lips like a goldfish so here we go. The question that I had was could you give somebody an example of the type of thing you would drop into your mind so that you can digest it overnight? Could you give us an example or examples of the types of things that you might use? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah, I actually, at this point \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this for 27 years, personally \u2013 and now I use question somewhat metaphorically. So, often, studying complexity, if I\u2019m going to be working with someone, I\u2019ll study a 20-page psychological diagnostic that someone\u2019s responded to and then I will just release it completely and that whole thing will be the question. And then I\u2019ll wake up and sit with it, or I\u2019ll do a workout and sit with it, and I\u2019ll just see what arises \u2013 what core patterns, what core themes, what core blockages did I pick up in all of that? Right? Because the unconscious is so much more powerful at studying complexity than the conscious mind. Tim Ferriss: And are you then just jotting these observations or emergent thoughts down on paper? Do you capture them in that way? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Oh, and I actually use Evernote. Tim Ferriss: You do? Josh Waitzkin: God, I\u2019m riffing on Evernote. No, but there\u2019s often a question as well. I find that most great thinkers are slicing through complexity like a knife through butter and then they arrive in an area of stuckness and they\u2019ll spend a long time on that stuckness. And they can spend, consciously at that point, days, weeks, and months, at that stuck point. But they can also study everything involved with that stuck point, sleep on it, wake up, and just slice right through it. So, for me, the question is usually that area of stuckness after I\u2019ve studied all the complexity, and that rhythm between consciously integrating technical information into my being, and then releasing it, and then seeing what arises is a huge part of how I approach creativity. Tim Ferriss: And, for those people who haven\u2019t heard my conversation with Reid Hoffman \u2013 founder or at least co-founder of LinkedIn who\u2019s called \u201cThe Oracle of Silicon Valley,\u201d oftentimes, by A players in Silicon Valley \u2013 he has a nearly identical process. But he, I believe, he does it, effectively right before bed \u2013 you do not? Am I right? [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: No. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Could you explain your rationale for when you sort of infuse your mind with, say, some particular problem \u2013 data set challenge, whatever it might be \u2013 and let it go? What time do you do that and why? Josh Waitzkin: In my experience \u2013 and Reid Hoffman\u2019s awesome and I\u2019m sure what he has is just crushing it for him \u2013 but, for me and for people that I\u2019ve worked with, I\u2019ve seen the pattern that, if they\u2019re thinking about it right before bed, they\u2019re actually thinking about it consciously and they\u2019re not releasing the conscious mind which is a huge part of that. Right? So, if you think about Hemingway\u2019s core principle that you were speaking about in that podcast you did about our best tips \u2013 or whatever you called it \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Josh Waitzkin Distilled? That was my headline. Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. It\u2019s just the core Hemingway principle of writing and then finishing his workday leaving something left to write. Right? As opposed to tapping the well, finishing it all up, which most people who are externally driven in what they\u2019re doing or thinking about how they\u2019re looking, or move by guilt as opposed to something more intrinsic, they feel guilty if they don\u2019t do everything that they have to do versus Hemingway\u2019s principle about doing just that. It\u2019s very interesting but he would always speak about \u2013 and I read this when I was 11 years old which is a big part of my foundation, I think, in this habit \u2013 he\u2019d speak about the importance of stopping your thinking at that point. Then he would relax, he would drink wine, he would release the day. Tim Ferriss: He drank a lot of wine. Josh Waitzkin: And, also, for me, as a chess player, I found that, if I study chess openings up until bed, I was thinking chess positions. If I studied it earlier and then released it, then I was able to dream about the insight. Tim Ferriss: So, for you now, earlier, goes that generally mean end of workday, pre-dinner? Josh Waitzkin: End of workday, pre-dinner, yeah. And I usually have a workout post-workday \u2013 like, right immediately at the end of my workday, I have some kind of exercise to do to flush my physiology \u2013 so it\u2019s before that workout. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We\u2019re going to come back to the workout but I want to rotate. I could spend seven hours with each of these guys. And we have spent seven hours together, certainly. Adam, what I\u2019d love to know \u2013 and I\u2019ve wanted to actually ask you this for quite a while \u2013 is, in your calendar, say, your weekly calendar, do you have any particular things blocked out or that occur on a weekly basis that are particularly important to you? I know that\u2019s super specific so if nothing jumps to mind\u2026 Adam Robinson: Well, nothing jumps to mind. I advise clients, very large hedge funds, on all global asset classes \u2013 so equities, currencies, bonds, commodities \u2013 and it\u2019s 24/7. And, by the way, it starts Sunday night which is when markets open up in China. So there\u2019s a brief window in the sense that, what Josh does about consciously turning off his mind, I do that about 3:00 on Friday and, for the next 24 hours, I make a point of not thinking about global markets. And then, already, come Sunday morning, I have to get ready to hit the ground running. And so that\u2019s usually when I get my ideas is Sunday because I\u2019ve given the week over on Saturday to just unconscious dreaming and then I have to hit the ground running. Tim Ferriss: What do the first few hours of Sunday look like? Do you have any particular morning routines or anything \u2013 boot-up sequences that you use for yourself? Adam Robinson: Work out, meditate \u2013 Josh introduced me to heartrate variability training which is outstanding. I\u2019m the kind of person who can\u2019t sit still for normal meditating. Tim Ferriss: So what does your meditation look like? Adam Robinson: It\u2019s just heartrate variability training. I just watch my heartrate for 20 minutes and do it a couple times a day. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Adam Robinson: So I start off the day with that. Tim Ferriss: So it\u2019s like the cardiac equivalent of biofeedback or neurofeedback? [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: Yes. Tim Ferriss: And the workout \u2013 what is the workout? Adam Robinson: Weights \u2013 very intense, get it over with \u2013 and then sometimes cycling. And then I start to write down what I expect to happen. I think the key to, certainly, investing is to have expectations and then wait to be surprised. And one of the key things with investing \u2013 I don\u2019t know how many of you invest but I think this is a life truism \u2013 is to be aware when you hear a voice in your head that says \u2013 and you\u2019ll usually squint your eyes or you\u2019ll hear someone say the following words \u2013 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d and it\u2019s always a sign of something really powerful. So, if somebody says to me, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense why gold keeps going lower,\u201d I know that it\u2019s got a lot lower to go because what that person just said, in saying it doesn\u2019t make sense, is this person has a dozen logical reasons why gold ought to be going higher and it\u2019s going lower and he says that doesn\u2019t make sense but the world always makes sense \u2013 what doesn\u2019t make sense is his model. And this also applies in life. In June, about a year ago, Donald Trump announced his candidacy and I think his first thing was, \u201cWe\u2019re putting up a wall and they\u2019re going to pay for it,\u201d and his numbers shot up in the polls. And somebody said to me \u2013 and I heard pundits on TV saying \u2013 \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d And I thought, \u201cOh my god. Wait.\u201d But that\u2019s precisely it \u2013 it means it\u2019s going higher. If a stock goes up and there\u2019s no rational reason, it means that there\u2019s some X factor that you haven\u2019t considered because it makes total sense now, in retrospect, but then it didn\u2019t. So, whenever you hear someone say something doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 I was talking to Sam Zell, a great real estate investor and all he does is he reads the newspaper and all he\u2019s looking for are things that don\u2019t make sense. So I said, \u201cGive me an example, Sam,\u201d and he says, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m reading the newspaper and I see that there\u2019s a Starbucks that\u2019s just opened up,\u201d \u2013 this is 15, 20 years ago \u2013 \u201cin Mongolia.\u201d Right? And he thinks to himself, \u201cMongolia? I thought they drank tea. What\u2019s with that?\u201d He\u2019s so curious about this because it makes no sense that he takes his private jet, flies to Mongolia, and he discovers that they\u2019ve started mining. This was the beginning of the big China infrastructure build and the only reason he knew about it is it didn\u2019t make any sense. So I\u2019m telling that\u2019s the key thing. People stumble on these ideas and then they dismiss them because they go, \u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d and I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s where the goldmine is, things that don\u2019t make sense. Tim Ferriss: I love it. Adam Robinson: That\u2019s all I pay attention to now. Tim Ferriss: And, on Sundays, when you\u2019re trying to come up with expectations or, I suppose educated or just hunch \u2013 [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: And I\u2019m looking for things that don\u2019t make sense. Tim Ferriss: No, understood. There are so many things in my life that don\u2019t make sense but this isn\u2019t a therapy session yet. Wait until the tequila comes out. What is the timeline? Are you looking for things that day or are you looking at things that might occur over a longer time horizon? Adam Robinson: Sometimes, I\u2019ve set expectations weeks or months prior and then I wait to see that things unfold as I expected. And, if not, you have to revise your hypothesis. Tim Ferriss: And so one of the reasons I wanted Adam to be onstage is because we hadn\u2019t had a real chance to catch up in a while and I was like, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we just do it in front of 900 people?\u201d So the question that I know we\u2019ve chatted about just a little bit but you have such an eclectic background \u2013 so you have The Princeton Review, you have the chess, and now global markets \u2013 what makes you good those different fields? You\u2019re a very humble guy but, if we were talking to your closest friends and we asked them, \u201cWhat is his superpower or what are the unique abilities or combination of abilities that have made him good in these very seemingly unrelated fields?\u201d what would they say or what would you say? Adam Robinson: Well\u2026 Hmm. Tim Ferriss: I might have to pull in Josh for this. [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: I can help with that. [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: I\u2019m a heretic so I always approach things to disrupt the order and I start with looking for things that no one else will spot. And there are two places that I know people don\u2019t prospect and I\u2019ve already told you the first \u2013 things that don\u2019t make sense \u2013 and the second is things that are really obvious. If it\u2019s obvious, no one bothers to examine it. And so, in global markets, I start from the premise that understanding is an illusion and that explanation is impossible. The world is simply too complex to understand so I don\u2019t bother trying. And all I do is I watch investors attempt to make sense of the world and they form views. So they\u2019re looking at the world trying to predict what\u2019s going to happen and all I\u2019m doing is studying them because they\u2019re the ones who are going to make buy and sell decisions and affect asset prices. So they study the world, I\u2019m behind them \u2013 it\u2019s like playing poker in \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I was going to say, \u201cDon\u2019t play the hand. Play the person across from you\u201d? Adam Robinson: Exactly. And so I see the hands that global investors are playing so I don\u2019t try to understand the world \u2013 I just try to get into their heads the same way I did with chess, right, getting into the head or the position of the other player, and in the SAT, getting into the head of the test. This is worth sharing. It\u2019ll take about 30 seconds. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ve got plenty of time. Adam Robinson: I went to Wharton undergrad and I got a law degree at Oxford. I came back to New York and I thought that what I wanted to do was write screenplays. So I go to a friend of my father\u2019s and he said, \u201cSo what are you going to do now, kid?\u201d and, all expectation, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be a writer.\u201d Just like that \u2013 full of expectation, a recent grad. And this guy was one of the top producers on Broadway ever, of all time, and he looks at me for about a minute, doesn\u2019t say a thing, and then he says, \u201cWell, then, if you\u2019re going to be a writer, I guess you better have something to say.\u201d And I, \u201cOh, shit. What do I know? I\u2019m 25. I have nothing to say.\u201d And I thought, \u201cOkay, well, I have to support myself somehow and, while I\u2019m writing\u2026\u201d I knew, if I went to Wall Street or worked at a law firm, I would never find the time to write and so I thought, \u201cI know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll tutor kids.\u201d And I thought, \u201cWell, what could I tutor them in?\u201d and I go, \u201cOh, I know \u2013 the SAT.\u201d Now, you don\u2019t this but, back then, nobody was getting tutored. And I wrote to every private high school in New York \u2013 and I remember there were 31 at the time because I had to type 31 letters, the same letter 31 times. It\u2019s like \u201cDear Dalton,\u201d or \u201cDear Spence, I just graduated. If you have any students who want to prepare for the SATs, send them my way.\u201d And, out of that mass mailing, I got one student \u2013 just a single student. And so I gave her a practice test. I said, \u201cYou do this and we\u2019ll go over it,\u201d and what was fascinating was that she got all the easy questions right and all the medium questions right but she missed every single hard question \u2013 every single one. And, just closing your eyes and guessing, you get one in five \u2013 she was batting zero and she was really smart. I said, \u201cOh, Joanne, what are you\u2026?\u201d \u2013 I still remember her name, Joanne \u2013 and I said, \u201cJoanne, could you just tell me your thinking process?\u201d And what was fascinating is she crossed off, let\u2019s say, Choices A, B, and C, got it down to D and E, and whichever one she chose, the answer was the other one. And I said, \u201cJoanne, could you just explain the logic?\u201d \u2013 again, trying to get into her head, always about getting into the head. It\u2019s all about appearances, it\u2019s all about thinking \u2013 there is no reality. Plato would have made a lousy investor. Anyway, to get back to Joanne \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Short Plato. Adam Robinson: Short Plato, exactly. So she says, \u201cWell, I cross off the ones that I know are wrong.\u201d I said, \u201cGood, good. Then what do you do?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, I pick the one that I think is right.\u201d So I blurted out, \u201cWell, you got to pick the one you think is wrong,\u201d and then I realized, \u201cOh, right. I just cracked the SAT. The only reason a hard question is hard is because whatever seems plausible can\u2019t be right. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a hard question,\u201d and that was my first insight. And then her score shoots up, she tells a bunch of friends, and their scores shoot up \u2013 10 students, 100, 200. Then I teamed with a guy and then we started The Princeton Review \u2013 John Katzman. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So who was \u2013 and I really apologize if I\u2019m misattributing this \u2013 but was there a sort of fictional character that you used to typify\u2026? Adam Robinson: Yeah. So I said \u2013 because I didn\u2019t want to hurt\u2026 So you get schizophrenic\u2026 Because then she would think, \u201cOkay, well, I think that\u2019s right, therefore, it\u2019s wrong. But, wait a second.\u201d She\u2019d get into a feedback loop. Right? Tim Ferriss: This is like every day of my life. Ramit Sethi: Your brain would explode. Adam Robinson: So, when I was at Oxford, my don always referred to blogs as \u201cthe man on the street.\u201d So I thought I would Americanize them. So I said, \u201cOh, okay. Ask yourself, \u2018What would Joe Bloggs do?\u2019 and, whatever he would do on a hard question, you do the opposite.\u201d And, by the way, if you\u2019re stuck on an easy question \u2013 the ones at the beginning \u2013 you follow whatever Joe Bloggs would do. And, by the way, the test, because of these techniques, they had to change the SAT because of the stuff I was doing. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re doing something right, I suppose. Adam Robinson: Eh. But it\u2019s very different now so you can\u2019t use those techniques. They\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Did you ever cause irreparable harm to someone who actually had the last name Bloggs? Adam Robinson: I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Alright. Adam Robinson: I hope not. Tim Ferriss: Just wondering. Josh Waitzkin: Do you mind if I throw in one question to dig in on Adam a little? Tim Ferriss: Sure. Then I have a whole slew for our silent partner here. Josh Waitzkin: So one of the things that\u2019s so amazing about Adam is how prolific he is and how high quality it all is. And he\u2019s in this realm of economics in which maybe one of the first principles is, \u201cDon\u2019t speak publicly about one of your views because then you\u2019ll get locked into it and the world will change your mind,\u201d and yet he\u2019s able to. And so one of the things I think might be really interesting to hear you talk about is how do you avoid falling into constructs yourself when you\u2019re giving advice so consistently? Adam Robinson: Ah, because I never have views on the market. I\u2019m always agnostic so all I\u2019m doing is reporting how the market is positioned to respond. So, for example, 13 months ago, early November, U.S. interest rates \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this will make any sense to you but \u2013 were 2.32 percent on the U.S. 10 Year and Janet Yellen was due to raise interest rates five weeks later. This was, again, about a year ago. And I sent out an alert to my clients saying that interest rates were about to plunge to multi-year lows and they said, \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d And I said, \u201cPrecisely,\u201d but I gave them the logic and they understood the logic. It\u2019s because one group of traders in the world has never been wrong about predicting interest rates and it\u2019s now who you would think \u2013 well, I\u2019ll tell you: it\u2019s metals traders. They\u2019re always right about interest rates. Anyway, so, once a client asked me\u2026 I said, \u201cRates are going lower,\u201d and he said, \u201cWell, what would you need to see to change your view?\u201d Tim Ferriss: Oh, that\u2019s a good question. Adam Robinson: It\u2019s the best question ever. Right? It\u2019s the scientific method. If you can\u2019t falsify your hypothesis, you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true. If you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re wrong, you certainly don\u2019t know when you\u2019re right. So I said, \u201cOh, well, if we see copper versus gold rally sharply, then rates will rally. But, if copper/gold is going lower, then interest rates are going to go lower,\u201d and they plunged. She raised rates in December and, by July; they were at all-time lows which made no sense, certainly, to Janet Yellen. She was expecting them to go higher and they went lower. So, always, that\u2019s the key thing with anything. And, probably, you could apply that question to relationships like, \u201cThis is what I think. Well, what would I need to see to set that up?\u201d \u2013 you set up that marker ahead of time because, otherwise, confirmation bias will come in and you\u2019ll start to rationalize. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, well, you\u2019ll not only have confirmation bias, but then you might even have \u2013 depending on the position you take \u2013 some type of sunk cost fallacy and just start layering problem upon problem. [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: Right. Tim Ferriss: And it\u2019s also, by the way just as a side note, a great way to avoid debates or arguments that will go absolutely nowhere, if you ask someone \u2013 slightly different but \u2013 \u201cIs there anything I could say that would lead you to change your mind about X?\u201d if that\u2019s what they want to have a debate about. If they say no, then you\u2019re like, \u201cGreat. I\u2019m going to go get a burrito. You can argue with this empty chair because it\u2019s a pointless exercise to begin with.\u201d It\u2019s such an important question. Ramit, you\u2019ve really intelligently run, from my perspective, the company you\u2019ve built and set policies in place, and really made a study of management. And I\u2019ve watched you refine it over time where you\u2019ve not only become more successful as a company and organization but you\u2019ve become more relaxed and you seem like you have as much bandwidth as you\u2019d care to have even though your default is just jamming, jamming, jamming. What are some of the most important decisions or different decisions you wish you had made in the early days when you were hiring the very first people, let\u2019s say? Ramit Sethi: Oh, the first things first, I wish that I had understood it\u2019s okay to let people make their own mistakes and the idea that I don\u2019t have to be instrumental in every single decision. Now, we have a much bigger idea and a much more refined concept of big wins. Focus on the big things in life like, for example, the thing that a lot of people might have heard me say is, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about lattes.\u201d Right? This is a classic thing in personal finance. Everyone says, \u201cOh my god. Don\u2019t spent $3.00 on lattes,\u201d which is the worst possible advice you can ever listen to because we have limited cognition \u2013 limited willpower \u2013 and we don\u2019t want to waste that precious resource on a $3.00 purchase. Right? Get the big things right in life and you don\u2019t need to worry about that. I wish I would have applied that earlier on in the business to the people that I started working with. That was sort of unconventional. The other thing that was very conventional was hire great people, fire fast \u2013 the things you sort of hear thrown around. Everybody hears it, everybody nods, and everybody ignores it until it happens to them. So every one of my friends who runs a business, we get together behind closed doors and everyone talks about the mistakes they made where they should have listened to typical advice. And I think one of the problems if you get any level of success is that you start to think those basic rules don\u2019t apply to you when, in reality, they apply to you more than ever. So it\u2019s very important to just remember just get the basics right. And, if you get the basics right in life, you don\u2019t have to worry about often optimizing at the margins. Life works pretty well if you have a good job, if you have good relationships, if you have a solid roof over your head \u2013 things are pretty good and that\u2019s a good basic thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, not majoring in minor things and this is a lesson I had to learn for myself \u2013 well, I\u2019ve had to learn for myself repeatedly \u2013 letting the small bad things happen to get the \u2013 [Crosstalk] Ramit Sethi: Yeah. It\u2019s got to happen. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 huge good things done. On the front of hiring, are there any particular books or resources\u2026? I know there\u2019s a book called Who that a lot of the startup CEOs that I know have found very helpful which is sort of a distilled version of Topgrading. Were there any particular resources or bits of advice\u2026? I know you\u2019ve done quite a bit with Jay Abraham but maybe not on the hiring front. What were the resources \u2013 books or otherwise \u2013 that you found most helpful, if any? Ramit Sethi: I wish I could recommend one but\u2026 And this is something that I hear from a lot of friends who are starting to hire and build their teams \u2013 they have 10, 15, 20 people and they\u2019re starting to realize, \u201cHey, this is actually pretty important.\u201d And they come to me and they go, \u201cI want to hire a project manager. How do I hire the best project manager?\u201d And I say, \u201cBasically, get ready to eat shit for the next two years because it\u2019s really hard and there\u2019s no great book that\u2019s going to lay it out because it is inherently complex and messy. And the fact of the matter is the first hire you make is going to be not good. The second\u2019s not good. The fifth\u2026 But, eventually, you\u2019re going to learn what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d And, by the way, it would be different from my company than another company. We did a partnership with this other company and they start their meetings off by doing a cheer and they sing songs and our company does not do that. Okay? Tim Ferriss: Ramit\u2019s company starts with ritual \u2013 [Crosstalk] Ramit Sethi: Yeah. We sing \u201cKumbaya.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Ramit Sethi: And that\u2019s great. Their company is awesome and our company is awesome in our own way. So nothing I could say would help them except the best advice I could give them is, \u201cYou have to go through the fire. You\u2019ve got to do it. You\u2019re going to make mistakes so just kind of accept that.\u201d Tim Ferriss: It reminds me of this story that the director/writer/musician/polymath Robert Rodriguez told me where he goes to these film festivals and he\u2019s had all these huge blockbusters now and film students or would-be filmmakers come up to him and they go, \u201cYeah, I want to do this but this happened and then we didn\u2019t have enough money for that. And, well, you know you can\u2019t do A, B, and C because this happened,\u201d and he said what they don\u2019t realize is that\u2019s the job of a filmmaker \u2013 nothing is going to work and it\u2019s up to you. That is the starting point \u2013 literally, the job description begins with, \u201cNothing is going to work, and then you have to figure it out.\u201d Now, I want to talk to you a little bit about something we were chatting about in the green room which I think you\u2019re particularly good at and that is interacting with haters and belligerent people on the internet. So \u2013 Ramit Sethi: What? I\u2019ve never had anyone send me an email like that in my life. Tim Ferriss: So some people like golf, some people like boxing, some people, I don\u2019t know, badminton \u2013 you like interacting with belligerent people on the internet. Ramit Sethi: Love it. I do it with every single one. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So can you describe for us the rules of engagement and sort of best practices for this sport? Ramit Sethi: Okay. Let me break it down for you. Everybody, listen up because you\u2019re going to get one of these people in your life, I\u2019ll tell you that right now. First of all \u2013 [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: This is so twisted. Ramit Sethi: It is very, very sadistic. Okay, when do you get the chance to talk to somebody who runs up to you in the street and says like, \u201cF you\u201d? Never. It never happens because people don\u2019t do that in the street. Right? But, online, they do it all the time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Ramit Sethi: And then I think about how I don\u2019t really feel much at risk because, if I went to a comedy show \u2013 if I go to Comedy Cellar \u2013 I would never dream of heckling the comedian because that\u2019s their job. They\u2019re always going to win. So I sit there politely, and I listen, and I laugh, and then I leave. When somebody comes in and sends you a message but you see 50 or 100 of them a day, there\u2019s no chance of them winning. And, actually, so I love it because I get the chance to interact with someone I normally would never interact with. If you play it right, you can get to see inside their mind and actually learn something pretty interesting. Sometimes, they might leave it at just, \u201cF you,\u201d but, over time, I\u2019ve come to realize it\u2019s very mathematical. Of 100 people that email me, they\u2019ll say something like, \u201cF you,\u201d or whatever, just very directly \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Just to translate, that\u2019s Burmese. It\u2019s \u201cFuck you.\u201d Ramit Sethi: And I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cWhy?\u201d Because what you need to do at this point is you need to bring it down. You need to tone it down. Okay? [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Ramit Sethi: Or I\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you having a bad hair day?\u201d and then it\u2019s very fascinating what happens next. So 50 percent of people never respond. You guys find that interesting? They sent you this email; you respond back, they don\u2019t respond at all so what\u2019s up with that? And, if you really wanted to find out, you could re-reply a day later and track that. Josh Waitzkin: So what is up with that? Ramit Sethi: Okay, I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s\u2026 Okay, so 25 percent of people are going to double down and get really, really angry, in which case, you double down and put a picture of someone with a really bad hair day and now they don\u2019t know what to do. 25 percent \u2013 and this is why it was all worth it \u2013 they go, \u201cOh my god, I didn\u2019t know you were actually going to read this,\u201d and now you have a discussion. Right? Now you can find out why they sent that. And this happens to me all the time \u2013 I cannot even tell you how often \u2013 and it is so fascinating to get the chance to talk to someone who\u2019s been on my email list for, say, four years and never have written me. They\u2019ve literally gotten tens of thousands of pages of material we\u2019ve sent them for free and the first thing they wrote was \u201cF you.\u201d I go, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Why\u2019d you say that?\u201d and some random joke I made on Page 3 of this email really set them off and they just had to write back. They had to write back and, most of them, they still say, \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would actually read it.\u201d I find it so fascinating that, in the world where we are so connected to other people, there\u2019s so many people that feel that no one is actually listening that they would sent an email knowing that no one\u2019s going to read it \u2013 that\u2019s what they believe \u2013 they would send it with all this emotionally loaded language and they would just send it out there. But, when someone actually listens, they\u2019re struck and that\u2019s when you can start engaging with them. I find it totally fascinating. Tim Ferriss: So another technique, another judo move, that I\u2019ve seen you do on Twitter, specifically, which I admire \u2013 and Chris Sacca is also very good at this, you should check out his technique \u2013 is when someone will be like, \u201cHey, fuck you, scam artist. What the fuck? Ah, get rich, LOLZ,\u201d and you\u2019ll respond with something like, \u201cInteresting. I\u2019m intrigued. Tell me more.\u201d And then they don\u2019t know what to do because they\u2019re expecting you to either respond with some anger or respond with something trying to be clever but, instead, you\u2019re like, \u201cInteresting.\u201d Ramit Sethi: Okay. So here\u2019s the thing: people are pattern matching. Right? If you read Cialdini\u2019s book, Influence, he talks about \u201cClick, Whirr.\u201d You do something and people are going to respond \u2013 very programmatic. Tim Ferriss: Wait, whirr? Ramit Sethi: It\u2019s like he\u2019s written \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, I got it, whirr. Ramit Sethi: Yeah. People are programmatic so, if you write someone an angry email, they\u2019re almost always going to write back really angry. But, for me, there\u2019s no\u2026 I\u2019m not angry at them. Right? I haven\u2019t done anything. All they did was send me an email which I\u2019ve seen a thousand other people send. And I know it\u2019s not me. I know that because that email that they\u2019re reading got sent out to a million other people and they all loved it so it\u2019s probably not me, \u2013 it\u2019s probably something going on with them, and I want to know. So, when you sort of respond in a way that\u2019s not the obvious, then, all of a sudden, you shift the entire conversation. Now, if I wrote back and said, \u201cF you,\u201d now that\u2019s what they expected and they feed on that but, when you change the whole dynamic, I think that\u2019s when you can have a really interesting discussion. Same thing for business, by the way. If you\u2019re looking at markets where, for example, if you were trying to create another Princeton Review today or you\u2019re trying to write another personal finance book, you probably don\u2019t want to go with the same \u201cClick, Whirr\u201d programmatic strategy. You want to try to analyze what is missing in the market, how are people not being taken care of or responded to instead of going with the same thing that everyone else is doing. Tim Ferriss: So, Josh, I want to ask you a question. Are you famous on the internet for handling haters well? Josh Waitzkin: I don\u2019t even\u2026 I barely know what the internet is but this is actually a really great fight principle. Now, I don\u2019t have any experience interacting with haters on the internet but I do have quite a bit of experience interacting with people who essentially say that in person. Tim Ferriss: Wait\u2026 what? Wait. So you opt not to be on Facebook but then you go out and find people who are going to say, \u201cFuck you,\u201d in person? What do you\u2026? Where do you\u2026? [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: No, I\u2019m talking about competing in martial arts. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, I see. Alright. [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: And so it\u2019s amazing\u2026 I spent years training at how to deal with fighting dirty opponents \u2013 so people who, in some kind of martial arts exchange, after the bell, will target your eyes \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Or chess? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Chess is like kicking you under the table or cheating with talking to a coach in the chess world but, in martial arts, it\u2019s a little bit less subtle. They\u2019ll actually try to kick you in the balls or take out your knees in between rounds \u2013 it gets pretty wild \u2013 or targeting your eyes, neck. And, initially, it will throw you off but I trained for years \u2013 because I had to win national world championships \u2013 you knew you had to deal with these guys and be at your best when they\u2019re at their worst. And so I spent a lot of years bringing in the dirtiest players you could find and learning how to play with them in the gym. And then I remember this time in the 2002 World Championships in Taiwan, I was fighting this Austrian guy and he was just the textbook dirty player. He was trying to bust my knees up after the bell, he hit me too solid \u2013 like straight up groin shots which were well-placed \u2013 but I\u2019d done all this training at this and so I was focusing very purely and I was smiling at him which is kind of your move. And he was so used to people responding to his dirty play with anger that, when I didn\u2019t give it to him and I smiled at him, he got desperate and he kept on doing more and more outrageous things. And, when I responded with no emotion, at the end of the fight, he was basically throwing himself on the floor. He was completely destroying himself because he needed my response like a leg \u2013 that was a leg he was used to leaning on. And so I think your principle is brilliant and I practice the in-person version of it. Ramit Sethi: It\u2019s a lot\u2026 It\u2019s interesting how much they apply. And, also, I noticed something you just off-handedly said is that you trained with dirtier players and that\u2019s something you\u2019ll find true of a lot of people who are at the top of their game \u2013 they find something that is interesting that is helping them develop and then they will actively seek it out. Like what person in their right mind would seek out dirty players and fight against them? Only someone who wants to be the best. Josh Waitzkin: Well, it\u2019s a very interesting thing that happens in different forms of competition which is that, if somebody plays outside the rules, the typical response is righteous indignation. Right? Because that person isn\u2019t playing by these rules which are arbitrary rules, anyway. So the weakness of almost any martial artist is the dogma of his sport. Right? And we could go through different martial arts like judo guys, for example, are incredible fighters but the rules of judo is that you can\u2019t lie on your back and so they\u2019ll turn themselves and land on their stomach in the middle of a throw which, as you know, exposes their back to being choked out in a real fight. Right? Or jiu jitsu guys might have a bias against footlocks, right, or might not be such good strikers. Or, like in Chinese martial arts, people believe it\u2019s not honorable to fight on the ground. So you build all this \u2013 you kind of make a cult of your inhibitions and you \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Make a cult of your inhibitions? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah, I think that actually comes from\u2026 I think my dad used that line in one of his books. I think it\u2019s a great term because people basically have some kind of insecurity or some kind of inhibition and they build a cult out of it and they protect it instead of taking it on and sort of finding the dirty player to go at your neck and your eyes. And so, for example, as a fighter, the way that this manifests is that, if someone starts targeting your Adam\u2019s apple and your eyeballs and you don\u2019t know how to deal with it, you\u2019re going to be furious because you don\u2019t know technically how to deal with it but, if you\u2019re trained with how to deal with it, then you\u2019re not going to have that emotional reaction. Tim Ferriss: So we\u2019ve talked about fighting Austrians. I want to talk about dancing bears. This is going somewhere, bear with me. I\u2019m not on LSD. Ramit Sethi: Yet. Tim Ferriss: No, that\u2019s a joke. Don\u2019t try this at home, kids. We\u2019re trained professionals on a closed course. So Josh is a recluse \u2013 is that fair? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Just go with it. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So Josh, when he\u2019s not fighting dirty Austrians, he prefers to be left alone for the most part. Occasionally, I\u2019ll drag him out to do something like this, in part because he will most certainly text me the next day and go, \u201cYou fucking fuck. You fucking fuck,\u201d which I find endearing. But he does not engage on the internet, does zero media, and I admire that because you\u2019re able to get a lot of deep work done and it\u2019s a challenge for me. I\u2019m able to do it but it takes a lot more effort because I\u2019ve exposed myself, not in a criminal way but in a public way. And could you explain\u2026? So we will sometimes joke when we\u2019re forced \u2013 or volunteer, in my case \u2013 to do something in front of a lot of people or to do something like a speaking engagement like, \u201cDance, baby, dance,\u201d and we\u2019ll talk about the bear. So could you give us some context on where this came from? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. So I have some history with this theme because, when I was 11 years old, my dad\u2019s book, Searching for Bobby Fisher, came out and then, when I was 15 years old, the movie came out and it was a big deal and so I was thrust into this mainstream media spotlight without asking to be. And that was in the middle of my chess career so I had this deep love for this art and I was so passionate about it, but I had so much attention on me that I found myself getting pulled into this externalized relationship with my first love and it was heartbreaking and I didn\u2019t have the internal tools to resist that pull. And I\u2019ve had several times in my life where I\u2019ve kind of had to do some\u2026 So I used to develop this computer chess program called \u201cChessmaster\u201d and I had to do press things for that and I wrote The Art of Learning and I had to do this big\u2026 what you\u2019re all doing now and which you\u2019re awesome at. And, during that time, I got pulled in with a public speaking tour quite a bit because everyone wanted to\u2026 The thing is that nothing really calcifies the growth process, in my opinion, like people who are on the speaking tour because they\u2019re being asked to speak about the same ideas that they spoke about the year before, and the year before, and wrote about three years ago, and as opposed to breaking new ground. And I\u2019m personally allergic to anything that will calcify or slow down my growth process because I love learning more than I love anything and so I have this ingrained allergy to anything that externalizes my relationship to the game. So the last public keynote address that I ever gave was a lot of years ago. Some speaking agency convinced me to work with them and I was doing some talks. And I was conflicted about it and I had all these ethical constraints on them, and they talked me to going to this event in Florida. Tim Ferriss: What were the ethical constraints? Josh Waitzkin: Just that I would only work with beautiful companies that were helping the world and were awesome. Tim Ferriss: They were like, \u201cOh, one of these guys.\u201d Josh Waitzkin: \u201cOne of these guys.\u201d So they just completely bullshit me about what I was going to go do and I went out to Florida thinking I was working with this group they told me was donating all these medical supplies to countries in Africa and I thought it was awesome and beautiful. It turns out I was going to the national sales convention of this big group and I just was literally the follow-up act to a monkey on stage. And I was speaking \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: A literal monkey? [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: It was actually a monkey. There was a monkey on stage that was doing, \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Monkey?\u201d or something. And I live my life in the realm that authenticity is the most important thing to me and I was going to speak about my pain, and my ideas from chess and martial arts, and stuff that I love and then I was just feeling this wild hilarity of being the follow-up act to a monkey and being just\u2026 That was where the dancing bear thing came from. So that was the last keynote address I ever gave. And so now, I only do public things, frankly, with you. I think, for the last many, many years, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve done. And then, if I give a talk, it\u2019s always a Q&A which is a dynamic dialogue where I actually can feel like I can learn from because you\u2019re speaking to a small group or a big group of really brilliant people who are all in in their training process and it\u2019s an exploration that I can learn from their questions. And so that\u2019s where the dancing bear comes from \u2013 the follow-up act to a monkey. Tim Ferriss: A real monkey. \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Monkey?\u201d That\u2019s coming up next, folks, so stand by. What book, or writer, or it could be thinker has most influenced each of you in the last, say, year? Or someone who\u2019s really just influenced you? Adam, do you have any thoughts on whom or what that might be? Adam Robinson: Well, I\u2019m always foraging for ideas so, for example, Cialdini\u2019s book, Influence, but I read far afield because the ideas in investing come from outside the domain. If you want to have an insight in whatever your field is, it helps to look outside your field. So I read constantly. And I read poetry \u2013 I like Rumi. So, actually, I\u2019m going to say Rumi because he\u2019s gotten me in touch with the mystical, and the mysterious, and the magical in life. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Do you gift many books? Adam Robinson: I\u2019m sorry? Tim Ferriss: Do you gift books to other people? Adam Robinson: I gift all the time. Tim Ferriss: If so, what are your \u2013 [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: I\u2019m a world champion gift giver. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: What are your\u2026? Adam Robinson: It\u2019s really\u2026 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: So that\u2019s your domain? [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: It\u2019s true. Adam gives so many books, gifts \u2013 it\u2019s amazing \u2013 to me and my son, Jack. He is a world-champion gift giver. I think that\u2019s absolutely true. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: This is going to be a digression, which is kind of my thing. So I remember once reading a bedtime story to Jack \u2013 long story \u2013 and the book was Giraffes Can\u2019t Dance. Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And this book, for two weeks, has been just decapitating me on Amazon. This book is a juggernaut. It is just \u2013 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: Seriously. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: It is just killing the Top Ten List on Amazon. Every Christmas, Giraffes Can\u2019t Dance will kick your ass. Josh Waitzkin: And you just blew it up on your podcast. Tim Ferriss: I did. Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: I think that\u2019s hadakidi \u2013 I think that\u2019s what that\u2019s called. Josh Waitzkin: Jack loves that book. Tim Ferriss: I will have to delay the publication of this esteemed podcast featuring Giraffes Can\u2019t Dance. First one\u2019s on me, guys. Come sponsor my podcast. Where the hell was I? Oh, yes. So you\u2019ve given a lot of books as gifts. What books have you gifted most often to other people? Is there a short list or just those that come to mind that you\u2019ve gifted more than once? Adam Robinson: No, it\u2019s really unique to each person so there\u2019s no one book because each gift reflects something I want to share with that person. Tim Ferriss: But I would imagine there have to be some generally applicable books that you\u2019ve enjoyed that you\u2019ve given to more than one person? Or is that not the case? Adam Robinson: Oh, I\u2019d have to think about that. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We\u2019ll come back. Adam Robinson: Okay. Yeah, come back to that. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ll come back. [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: Because that\u2019s a tough question. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: We got room in between Giraffes Can\u2019t Dance. Adam Robinson: By the way, I can\u2019t let Ramit\u2019s \u201cFuck you\u201d thing go. If any of you want to get in touch with him, you know how to get his attention. [Crosstalk] Ramit Sethi: Oh god, what have I done? Adam Robinson: So, wait, if you have business opportunities, anything\u2026 And I believe this works well with everyone so\u2026 [Crosstalk] Ramit Sethi: Thanks so much. Tim Ferriss: And, if you want Josh to do a speaking engagement, you have to practice your dirty fighting skills and figure out how to throw a good \u2013 [Crosstalk] Adam Robinson: Kick him in the groin. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Groin kicks. Adam Robinson: That\u2019ll get his attention. Tim Ferriss: And for all the people who have been asking me to introduce them to Josh to do media, he\u2019s not going to do it. He would rather be fighting, and cooking turkeys, and riding his one-wheel around. Josh Waitzkin: Surfing. Tim Ferriss: And surfing which is a big thing. So, Ramit, what about you in terms of thinkers, or books, or anything, really, that\u2019s influenced your thinking a lot in the last year? Ramit Sethi: I read a lot of military books. I think that the military is amazing at building training programs and identifying people who are good and then making them great. So, especially at the Special Operations level and, having met some of those folks and doing some work with them, it\u2019s pretty outstanding the way that they can cultivate mastery. So that\u2019s great. Books I\u2019ve gifted: Gift of Fear is an amazing book, particularly for women, but I actually think everybody. Learning to trust your intuition \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Gavin de Becker? Ramit Sethi: Yeah, Gavin de Becker. And he talks about \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Who, by the way, not to interrupt, but he has a company that does very high-end security details for high profile folks. Ramit Sethi: Exactly. Trusting your intuition, knowing when the little antenna at the back of your head goes up, and you can\u2019t see anything, and we so often say, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m going to walk down that alley or I\u2019m going to just go into my house like normal,\u201d but listen and learn to trust your intuition because we have it but it kind of gets suppressed because we don\u2019t want to be that weird person. So that\u2019s a great gift. I can\u2019t recommend it enough. The two books I wish I could gift more: Charlie Munger\u2019s\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanac? Ramit Sethi: Yeah, Poor Charlie\u2026 It\u2019s an amazing book on mental models, super dense, and nobody wants to get that book as a gift. It\u2019s a gift you have to buy, not get gifted. That one and also Breakthrough Advertising which I think is one of the most sophisticated books on marketing every written. It\u2019s super dense. I read it every year and I learn something new. Tim Ferriss: Who\u2019s the author? Ramit Sethi: Eugene Schwartz. Tim Ferriss: Eugene Schwarz? Ramit Sethi: And it\u2019s an amazing, amazing book on copywriting and, really, human psychology but, again, nobody wants to get that as a gift. Look it up and buy it if you want it, but it\u2019s fantastic. Tim Ferriss: What about you, Josh? And I\u2019ll give you two options here: it could be someone or something that has really changed or informed your thinking in the last year or it could be something you\u2019re really looking into, subject matter-wise, or a particular thinker you\u2019re diving into in the coming year. Josh Waitzkin: Well, you and I have talked about books a lot, right, so we\u2019re just going to set that\u2026 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Well, we don\u2019t have to\u2026 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. We\u2019ve done a lot of best books. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: We don\u2019t have to just set the record on the platter and play the same track. Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But subject matter-wise? Josh Waitzkin: So my foundation of books which we\u2019ve discussed \u2013 Laozi, Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Robert Pirsig \u2013 these are books that were really important to me recently and we\u2019ve discussed all these so we\u2019re not going to\u2026 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah, but I have a question for you about one of them. Josh Waitzkin: Which one? Tim Ferriss: Can we jump in? [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: Yeah, let\u2019s do it. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So the Tao Te Ching? Josh Waitzkin: Tao Te Ching, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So this has come up a lot in the podcast. A lot of people like it \u2013 Rick Rubin, yourself \u2013 but, if I recommend that book to, say, ten people, of those ten, two may seem to enjoy it, and eight are like, \u201cWhat is this? I can\u2019t make any sense out of it. It\u2019s just like a book of fortune cookies. What\u2026?\u201d Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. It\u2019s so ambiguous. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u201cWhat is this? \u2018There\u2019s no there there.\u2019 What the hell is this?\u201d So what are they missing or how should they read it? Josh Waitzkin: My favorite definition of wisdom comes from the glossary of Robert Thurman\u2019s translation of the Vimalakirti\u00a0Sutra and it\u2019s tolerance of cognitive dissonance and that\u2019s what Laozi is about. Right? So, if you read the Tao Te Ching\u2026 First of all, I think it depends on what translation you read. You need to read, in my opinion, the Gia Fu-Feng and Jane English version. Tim Ferriss: Say that one more time? Josh Waitzkin: Gia Fu-Feng and Jane English translation of the Tao Te Ching, I think is the most true that I\u2019ve run into and I think I\u2019ve read them all. I don\u2019t read ancient Chinese so I\u2019ve had to kind of circle it. And a lot of these \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re so lazy, man. [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: I almost took up learning ancient Chinese years ago for that one purpose but the reason a lot of these translations are sort of thesis statements which take away the ambiguity and I think a lot of people don\u2019t want to tolerate cognitive dissonance. Laozi doesn\u2019t tell you what to do. It\u2019s \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Okay. So is it the lack of specific prescription that is kind of almost a Warshak test of sense? You\u2019re looking at the tea leaves and what you see tells you? How you interpret it tells you what you need to know as opposed to\u2026? [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: Well, this principle that Ramit was speaking about \u2013 the response to aggression with empty space, with non-violence \u2013 this is at the essence of Laozi. For me, it was very important during the period where I was transitioning, where I was dealing with this existential crisis of my chess career where I\u2019d been working with a coach for several years who was urging me to study the opposite style from what was natural to me. I was being pulled in this externalized relationship to things and it was kind of the entrance into my philosophical exploration of self-expression, of authenticity, of a deeply intrinsic relationship to my search for truth as opposed to being driven by the external \u2013 competing from the inside out as opposed to the outside in. So it was a big part of my foundation in self-development. So maybe that\u2019s\u2026 And all those authors that I just mentioned were a huge part of that. In the last year, I have to tell you, this is a brilliant book. Sam sent me an advanced copy. This Tools of Titans is\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2026 Tim and I are dear friends \u2013 I love the guy \u2013 but I give him so much shit. Trust me; I\u2019m not saying this if it isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s a goldmine. Your podcast is brilliant and I believe it\u2019s your calling in a lot of ways, at least in this period of your life, because you\u2019ve taken the art of deconstruction \u2013 which I think is your finest art \u2013 and you\u2019ve developed this medium with which you can study people and get to the essence of them so quickly. And I\u2019m stunned by how you can have so many conversations that are deeply meaningful and then you can really get to the essence of someone by studying them for a few days or a week. I couldn\u2019t fucking do that. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to see. Then you\u2019re bringing it to the world. You\u2019re gifting the best ideas of a lot of who you consider brilliant people through this podcast but then you have to listen to two, three hour talks \u2013 which is awesome but a lot of people don\u2019t have the patience \u2013 and this is a way of just shortcutting your way in. And so I think this is actually a goldmine. I\u2019ve been reading it and loving it myself. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, Josh. Josh Waitzkin: I really mean that. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, man. Josh Waitzkin: It\u2019s true, dude. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, man. Josh Waitzkin: I wouldn\u2019t say it if it wasn\u2019t true. Tim Ferriss: I didn\u2019t slip him a twenty. He\u2019s an expensive date. [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Thank you, Josh. Josh Waitzkin: Another book which I think is really important right now is a buddy of mine who you had on, Sebastian Junger, his book, Tribe. Tim Ferriss: Yes. 100 percent agreed. Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. I thought your interview with him was beautiful. You guys really\u2026 The introduction of these two guys was hilarious. The text exchange to get them to loosen their shit up with one another was really funny but, finally, they did and I thought that was a\u2026 Sebastian\u2019s been studying evolutionary psychology and\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Yes. So Josh introduced us \u2013 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: It was ridiculous. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and we were up doing this, \u201cVery nice to meet you, sir.\u201d \u201cYes, good day, sir.\u201d This very kind of weirdly sort of formal exchange \u2013 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: \u201cHave your publicist talk to my publicist.\u201d [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and so Josh jumped in a few levels down. He\u2019s like, \u201cGuys, loosen the fuck up.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay. Alright.\u201d Tribe, I highly, highly recommend. It\u2019s a great short read. So I\u2019ve asked people oftentimes \u2013 and we are going to do some Q&A in about 12 minutes so hold your horses but we\u2019ll definitely get there shortly \u2013 the question I\u2019ve asked often, and there are many, but is what advice would you give your 30-year-old self or your 20-year-old self? It tends to produce one or two of the same answers: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say anything because I wouldn\u2019t want to change where I am,\u201d or, \u201cEnjoy it,\u201d is very common. The question, though, that I\u2019d like to pose is a bit different and it is what advice do you think the happiest version of your 80-year-old self would give you now? So anyone who wants to tackle that is welcome to give it a shot. Ramit Sethi: Well, let me riff off of something that Josh said about \u2013 you were talking about the book where two people love it and eight people are like, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \u2013 and I think that, in this day and age, we are given so much advice. And, as someone who is in the advice industry, I see it and I have a healthy disdain for a lot of advice. And, if you follow the advice that people give you, you\u2019ve got to wake up and, by 3:00 a.m., you\u2019ve got to be hustling, and you need to be doing all this stuff until\u2026 And it\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t do all this stuff and feasibly be a normal human being. I had books that people told me I need to read and I opened them up and I\u2019m like, \u201cThis book is shit. Who the hell\u2026?\u201d but 20 people I like told me to read it. And then \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Give me an example. Can you think of one? Ramit Sethi: Yes, because I ended up loving it. So here\u2019s a classic simple example \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: The Four-Hour Workweek? No. Ramit Sethi: When I was in my early 20s, I read 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing \u2013 or Branding \u2013 and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d and I just\u2026 And then I picked it up again when I was 30 and I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d I wasn\u2019t ready for it and I\u2019m glad that I gave it another chance because I didn\u2019t have the context. And I\u2019m willing to bet\u2026 And I\u2019m not saying that I got better \u2013 things just changed and, by the time I was 30, I was ready for it. I guarantee this book, maybe some of the people just don\u2019t like it and that\u2019s fine, but maybe some of them don\u2019t have the context, or they\u2019re not ready, or it\u2019s just not integral right now. Everybody \u2013 including in the book, which I love \u2013 meditation\u2019s a classic thing and I don\u2019t meditate. And I try not to feel guilty about it because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right time in my life. I have a very calm mind and I have the ways that I like to enjoy, and all that stuff. It just doesn\u2019t involve meditation but I\u2019m sure\u2026 Because I believe that most of us are basically the same in most parts of life and, if we embrace that, then we can optimize it and we can free up that 2 percent that we\u2019re different and get really unique and special. I bet you that, as I get a little bit older, I will become more spiritual, I will probably meditate \u2013 these are classic things that happen. I think if I were 80 years old, I would look back and say, \u201cListen to the advice and hear what people are telling you to do but, if it doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s okay to say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to put that aside, come back to it in a year or five years, and maybe, at that point, the book will be great or I will be ready to meditate but I just don\u2019t have interest in it right now. It just doesn\u2019t feel right and that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t need to do what everybody else says. I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right for me, be a great version of myself, improve, but be really judicious about who you\u2019re listening to and what you\u2019re applying.'\u201d Tim Ferriss: I think, also, you mentioned intuition and The Gift of Fear. This is something I\u2019ve really tried hard to resurrect for myself in the last few years because I\u2019ve been driven by pro and con lists, and spreadsheets, and this, that, and the other thing and using my left side of the brain that\u2019s simplistic, obviously, and just trying to use an analytical framework for everything and took a lot of wrong turns. I\u2019d be like, \u201cThis deal is great,\u201d and I remember at one point ages ago, this girlfriend said to me, \u201cWait, do you trust this guy at all?\u201d I was like, \u201cNot really,\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d And then I did the deal and, of course, it was a disaster. So I think the intuition is also really important to develop an ear for when you\u2019re making those types of decisions to put things aside. Adam? What would your 80-year-old self tell you now? Adam Robinson: Well, one of my favorite quotes was by one of my heroes, Juan Belmonte and Juan Belmonte was sort of the Rocky of bullfighting in the early part of the century. He fought pre-antibiotics, so even a scratch of a bull\u2019s horn, you could die from that. They used to call him \u201cThe Flying Matador\u201d because he was so bad the bulls would just keep tossing him the air but he was really \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I did not see that coming. Adam Robinson: And there\u2019s a quote in there that I love and, actually, one I\u2019d really like to share because it\u2019s germane to everything we do because we hear about achieving, and performing, and being our best selves. Mind you, this is a bullfighter who rose from poverty to be the best bullfighter of all time and with no aptitude for the sport, really. And, if you\u2019re bad at martial arts, or surfing \u2013 whatever \u2013 but, if you\u2019re bad at bullfighting, you die. Anyways, so he said the following, he said, \u201cNo life worthy of the name consists of anything more than the continual series of struggles to develop one\u2019s character through the medium of whatever one has chosen as a career.\u201d Which that\u2019s fascinating because, now, your career becomes reframed as merely something with which you\u2019re going to develop your character. And so I think that\u2019s what my 80-year-old self would say, to just remind me of that \u2013 \u201cKeep working on your character. It really doesn\u2019t matter what you do.\u201d Tim Ferriss: What aspect of your character are you most trying to develop in your current primary\u2026? Adam Robinson: Fearlessness. Tim Ferriss: What was that? Adam Robinson: Fearlessness. Tim Ferriss: Fearlessness? Adam Robinson: Yeah. Josh, that\u2019s a tough act to follow. Josh Waitzkin: That was beautiful, man. Tim Ferriss: I have trouble remembering four-word quotes. That was amazing. I\u2019m like, \u201c\u2018To be or not to\u2026\u2019 how\u2026.?\u201d Alright, Josh, how about your 80-year-old self? Josh Waitzkin: Well, I\u2019m in the midst of this transition from being a fighter, a competitor, and then literally a fighter, to being a nurturer, primarily. And my relationship with this sport that I\u2019m taking on now with paddle surfing, which is my fourth big mountain in terms of my own training, is much more about receptivity, and feeling the ocean, and entering that sweet spot of enormous power of something that\u2019s traveled thousands of miles. And so a big reason that I\u2019ve gone that way is because I feel that the art of receptivity is just a never-ending pool I intuit from here. And so receptivity and love is a huge part of what I intuit is where I\u2019ll be focused for the next 10, 20, 30 years and so I would say from here that, from my perspective now, that\u2019s what I think my 80-year-old self would be telling me to focus on is deep listening to humans, and nature, and what\u2019s moving most elementally inside of myself. I\u2019m a completely devoted dad and I can\u2019t imagine my 80-year-old self saying anything but, \u201cSeize every moment you can with these little dudes and give them every ounce of love you can.\u201d And I also feel in myself now a commitment to living life \u2013 every last drop as fully as I can ever live it. And, honestly, I live in New York now and this is putting that into question because I\u2019m so passionate about the\u2026 I love New York. I\u2019m a New Yorker. I love the city but I\u2019m yearning for nature right now. I feel, in some ways, that living in the water is what\u2019s needed for this next surge of me living life as fully as possible in my own development. And so I think that that\u2019s the direction my 80-year-old self would be giving me a kick in the ass but he\u2019ll be a lot wiser than I am so\u2026 Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s so many questions I want to ask \u2013 we\u2019ll have to continue this \u2013 but let\u2019s start with one which is what is some of the worst advice that you hear given out in your world? And you can choose world however you want to define it. That could be past career, current career, it could be circle of friends, it could be anything like that. Or a terrible piece of advice \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be the worst \u2013 but a common piece of advice? And I\u2019ll buy some time here. For me, I remember applying to colleges and having my guidance counselor in high school tell me to lower all my standards because I wanted\u2026 I had my reach schools, my A list, I had my \u201cI think I can get into\u201d B list schools, and then my safety schools, and he said, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d He laughed. He said, \u201cOh, Tim. Silly, silly boy. You need to take your safety schools and make those your reach schools. You\u2019re five paragraphs too high here.\u201d And, not realizing at the time \u2013 I realized this soon thereafter \u2013 that his incentive was to be able to say, \u201cX percentage of my students got into their first-choice college.\u201d The easiest way to do that is to make everyone lower their standards. So that was a terrible piece of advice that I received and a terrible piece of advice that I hear a lot. So the antithesis of that would be, \u201cHold the standard,\u201d which is the advice, for instance, at The Fat Duck which was, at the time, the No. 1 ranked restaurant in the world. Heston Blumenthal said that to someone I\u2019ve had on this podcast, Chris Young, is like, \u201cHold the standard,\u201d because he tried to pass something off that was 99 percent perfect, but not 100 percent. So anyone want to take a stab at that? Josh Waitzkin: \u201cDo it the way that that guy did that.\u201d Tim Ferriss: \u201cDo it the way that guy did it?\u201d Josh Waitzkin: Yeah, people give advice all the time that you should follow this prescriptive path to success. Tim Ferriss: Yup. Josh Waitzkin: And I think that excellence is all about self-expression. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Josh Waitzkin: And so people look outside and try to replicate the path of somebody else but then, when the shit hits the fan as it always does \u2013 when the pressure\u2019s on \u2013 it\u2019s not coming from inside of you. Tim Ferriss: How much of self, let\u2019s just say \u2013 Tim, Josh, and so on \u2013 is discovery versus creation, in your mind? In other words, do you \u2013 [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: That\u2019s a great question. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 start with the raw materials of everything that Josh represents and then it\u2019s a process of pulling back the layers of the onion and discovering these different pieces? Or is it really just tabula rasa\u2026? [Crosstalk] Josh Waitzkin: I think you\u2019re entangled. Tim Ferriss: Yeah? Josh Waitzkin: I think that, as we\u2019re discovering ourselves, we\u2019re creating ourselves. I think about this in the context of someone taking on an art. They have to understand who they are. I think people should do what they love and they should do it in a way that they love but that evolves and so it\u2019s not stuck. It\u2019s not static. It\u2019s dynamic. It\u2019s dynamic quality versus static quality and so there\u2019s the act of creation in the discovery process. And I\u2019ve experienced that the biggest losses that I\u2019ve had and the biggest disappointments that I\u2019ve had have led to the biggest wins of my life. In many ways, that\u2019s because I created myself based on the response to that experience. And I think that\u2019s actually really an important part of this principle of unobstructed self-expression \u2013 doing it from what\u2019s inside out. That\u2019s always changing and you have to be attuned to it. So the way I would respond to that would be that, intuitively, they\u2019re fundamentally entangled and navigating that entanglement is a big part of the genius and the growth curve. Agree? Tim Ferriss: I do agree. Well, I agree that that is an interesting viewpoint to have on it. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m\u2026 That sounds like a dick-ish way of saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand a thing that you just said,\u201d but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t have a firm position on it. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m exploring for myself and thinking through myself. So that\u2019s why I hang out with these guys is to get something to chew on. So I have to chew on that. I don\u2019t know if I agree with it. Josh Waitzkin: I don\u2019t know either. You just asked a question and I thought it up. That\u2019s what I think. Tim Ferriss: Ramit? Ramit Sethi: I heard the most interesting pieces of advice recently and it blew up something I\u2019d believed my whole life. So my friend, Nick Ray, runs a company on museums and he takes people in museums and he gives them tours that are really cool. And he was talking about how he goes to a museum himself and he said, \u201cIf I go to a museum, I\u2019m spending 90 minutes, max, and the first 30 minutes are in the caf\u00e9 planning where I\u2019m going to go.\u201d And I\u2019m sitting there saying, \u201cWait, what?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The way I was raised, we would go to a museum maybe once every five years \u2013 maybe \u2013 as kids. We\u2019d save up our money to go there and we would spend seven hours going every level because we knew we were never going to go back. And what Nick was saying, in so many words, was have the abundance to know that you can go back and don\u2019t think that it\u2019s once and done. And also know that leave at the peak \u2013 there\u2019s power in leaving at the peak.\u201d And it blew my mind to think that, my whole life, at that point at 34, that I had just thought, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go through every single thing and check the box.\u201d But, really, he\u2019s talking about curation \u2013 he\u2019s talking about abundance \u2013 all in a simple one-sentence example. Tim Ferriss: I love it. It also reminds me of \u2013 we won\u2019t dig into it right now but we\u2019ve talked about it before \u2013 the ending on a good rep, ending on quality. They\u2019re really closely related for both achievement, in that case, and skill development but also just for appreciation and quality of life. Adam, what about you? Adam Robinson: Which question are we talking about here? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what are your thoughts on the last ten minutes of conversation? What\u2019s bad advice that you\u2019ve received, or heard, or that you want to give? Adam Robinson: I remember I had sold my interest in The Princeton Review, and I was wondering what to do next with my life, and I was speaking at the time with two older, very successful, mega successful, businessmen \u2013 this was about 20 years ago \u2013 and one of them said I should go into ball bearings. He thought for a second and he said, \u201cAdam, ball bearings.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s great. I love that. Adam Robinson: Right. And he said, \u201cOkay, stay with me here.\u201d He said, \u201cAll the smart talent from universities, they\u2019ve gone to Wall Street and they\u2019ve exhausted whatever there is to be found there. You\u2019re crazy smart but you\u2019re competing with other people who are crazy smart and why do that?\u201d And, by the way, I thought he was\u2026 So he said there were no more possibilities there which that also was wrong. But the second part was interesting: he said, \u201cBall bearings.\u201d He said \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Ball bearings. Adam Robinson: Right. No, but you\u2019ll see the relevance in a second. He said, \u201cBall bearings have not had its Edison. Right? No one\u2019s gone into ball bearings so it\u2019s\u2026 No one\u2019s ever thought about ball bearings.\u201d [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s fertile ground. Adam Robinson: They\u2019re little round things in different shapes \u2013 I mean, sorry, different sizes. So he said it was a metaphor. Right? The metaphor was, \u2018go with something that no one else has ever looked at.\u2019 And then you look at Uber \u2013 who thought about taxis \u2013 you look at Airbnb, you look at the most successful companies, and they\u2019re pursuing the ball bearings philosophy, right? And so the first part, that opportunities on Wall Street had been exhausted, that part was wrong but the ball bearings part was right. And I was talking to a friend who was wondering what she should do with her career and I said, \u201cOh, ball bearings. Find something that\u2026\u201d And there was a pencil on the table, a No. 2 pencil, and I said, \u201cThere. Why don\u2019t you reinvent the pencil? Who thinks about pencils? I don\u2019t, which means there\u2019s an opportunity there.\u201d And the wonderful thing about the world is, today, you can find any niche and there are enough people in the world that you can make a fortune on No. 2 pencils. So, if any of you are wondering what to do with your lives, they\u2019re there \u2013 No. 2 pencils, or ball bearings, really, cups. It doesn\u2019t matter. Find something that \u2013 tables \u2013 find something no one thinks about and think about it. Tim Ferriss: No, it\u2019s great advice and it actually reminds me of a trip I had recently. I went to Utah and we went to this\u2026 it\u2019s not even fair to call it an estate. It was just a state. The guy, this single individual, but he owned a state. It was this gigantic property: he had his own air strip, he had tons of buildings, and he had his own fishing pond, ludicrously wealthy. And I asked what he did to make all this money. And they go, \u201cOh, yeah, you know those little parts of the wing that flip up vertically? He figured those out like ten years ago.\u201d It\u2019s something you barely notice in the aviation world. It\u2019s probably the equivalent of wheels on luggage. It was like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anybody think of that earlier?\u201d And now he just prints money but it was because he took something very unsexy and was willing to dive into it. Well, I want to let these gents have a shot at cavorting and causing trouble in the back. Ladies and gentlemen, let\u2019s give a hand for Josh Waitzkin, Ramit Sethi, and Adam Robinson. Josh Waitzkin: Thanks, guys. Ramit Sethi: Thanks a lot.

spearfishing \u2013 freediving is something i love", "i was spearfishing and it was actually an interesting moment because i had just speared a couple mutton snappers for lunch with my family down in

wrong side of it", "it exploded into my tooth and so i have this wonderful snaggletooth", "and i just told tim right before that it came loose right before now", "so i could very easily have a snaggle tooth with a screw hanging out within about 5, 10 minutes of the beginning of this discussion which will add to the flavor of it", "i\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re talking about that, but there it is", "so, for those of you listening on audio only, this is what you miss when you don\u2019t come to a live tim ferriss show", "i thought we\u2019d begin \u2013 and, maybe, adam, we\u2019ll start with you \u2013 we are recording this towards, say, the tail end of a year", "how do you think about the transition from one year to the next", "do you have new year\u2019s resolutions or do you have any particular routines or approaches as you close out a year", "i try to take stock of what i\u2019ve learned the past year", "and i\u2019ve learned three things this year \u2013 and two of which, you exemplify \u2013 and i wish i had known them when i was younger", "and i\u2019d like to share them because i think they\u2019re the keys to success and, again, you exemplify them", "the first is the importance of enthusiasm with everything that you do \u2013 absolutely everything", "the second is the importance of connecting to people", "i live in the world of ideas and it\u2019s only this year that i\u2019ve learned the importance of connecting with brothers like you guys", "and, the third, this is best illustrated with a metaphor", "about 20 years ago, i met the dog who was in the mask", "do you remember the jim carrey movie, the mask", "so \u2013 [crosstalk] was that just a personals ad or\u2026", "this was the\u2026", "[crosstalk] no, i met the dog and his trainer", "[crosstalk] oh, okay", "oh, i got it", "got it", "right", "okay, so i met the dog and his trainer and we were walking down the street in new york", "and the dog \u2013 so this is a star dog, right, a hollywood star dog, a little jack russell terrier \u2013 and so he was walking down the street and, every time someone passed by, he went like this", "and we walked a little further and then\u2026 and i thought, \u201cthat\u2019s so perfect", "he expects magic in every encounter.\u201d and i think that\u2019s one of the key things that i\u2019ve learned \u2013 that, if you expect magic in every encounter, you find it like this", "i\u2019m really excited for you guys because i know the magic that\u2019s going to happen here with this crew", "so that\u2019s what i\u2019ve learned this year", "so that\u2019s what i do with my new year\u2019s", "now, is that something that you ruminate on as an internal dialogue", "is it something you write down", "how do you\u2026", "are there any ways in which you attempt to ensure that you continue to pay attention to those things in your\u2026", "i just try to live it", "there\u2019s no\u2026 expecting magic, again, i picture that little dog, walking down the street, and i lean into every moment expecting magic the way that dog leaned into the person and\u2026 well, i think we saw that in the green room just before we got\u2026", "right", "we\u2019re not going to name names but, to everybody in the room \u2013 even people he hadn\u2019t met \u2013 if he heard their name from far away, he would go, \u201cjack!\u201d and just walk straight up", "and the person would be like, \u201chi,\u201d and then big hug and then thick as thieves right from the get-go", "ramit, what about you", "how do you think about the end of years, the beginning of new years", "i think about relationships", "i think, in the past, it was, \u201ci\u2019m 23, or i\u2019m 25, or i\u2019m 28 \u2013 where am i supposed to be?\u201d and i think, at a certain point, that sort of loses its\u2026 you realize there\u2019s no real roadmap", "right", "you\u2019re going to carve out your own path", "the thing that became more important for me is, \u201cwho am i meeting", "what\u2019s the quality of those relationships?\u201d and so, if it was up to me, i\u2019ll basically sit in my house and work all day long", "and that\u2019s just like i love it, that\u2019s what i want to do, and i would just do that for ever", "and that\u2019s probably not the healthiest approach to life so i try to force myself to go out, not only maintain the relationships i have, but build new ones, and i think the end of the year is a really good time to take stock", "so i actually have a list of every single person i met the whole year \u2013 i have it in a google doc \u2013 and i just look at it and say, first of all, is this the right level that i want to be doing", "if i\u2019ve met five people, that\u2019s not good for me", "and, also, is it just making a list or it actually making new friends", "like i said, it would be easy for me to just sit around and just work all day \u2013 [crosstalk] so are you then\u2026", "let\u2019s say that you come home, you\u2019ve had a number of meetings that day or that week, and, on a weekly basis, you\u2019re inputting these names", "no, i just write it down", "i just write down their names \u2013 that\u2019s it", "i see", "just so i can go back and look and say, \u201chey, these are amazing people that i\u2019ve met and now i\u2019m remembering \u2013 i look at it every week \u2013 \u201cokay, wow", "i found this interesting article", "i want to send it over.\u201d \u201coh, i\u2019m going out to the museum", "let me text this person to come hang out.\u201d and it\u2019s just a good reminder for me that the business is the business \u2013 it\u2019s going to grow, this and that \u2013 but the one thing that i want to fight for to make time for is to build those relationships", "what would you like to improve upon most \u2013 personally or from a business standpoint \u2013 next year", "oh my god, easy \u2013 easy by a factor of 1,000", "it\u2019s becoming a better leader and manager", "i feel like, in my business, we get the human psychology part of what we do \u2013 that\u2019s what we do \u2013 but management and leadership is so infinitely complex that i think i could spend the next 20 years just getting good, not even great", "how do you think about\u2026", "and this might be one that we get to as a group", "but management, i think, is relatively easy to grasp", "people can envision what that means", "what is a good leader", "how would you define a good leader or what are the characteristics that distinguish them from someone who is merely a good manager of, say, a team of 50 people or 100 people", "well, first of all, i\u2019m a student so i\u2019m trying to learn that myself but the leaders that i\u2019ve seen, first off, i think they know when to speak up and when not to speak up", "it\u2019s almost like a good parent", "a good parent knows when to get in there and, \u201coh, okay, you\u2019re about to fall off a cliff, let me save you but, if you\u2019re just going to fall down on the grass, let me let you make that mistake.\u201d and that\u2019s something that i\u2019m trying to learn which doesn\u2019t come naturally to me", "if it were up to me, i want to get in there every minute and that\u2019s not a healthy way, i think, to be a leader", "so that\u2019s something that i\u2019ve been working on", "my team\u2019s been telling me and i have to listen to that", "other leaders, i think, create a vision for where they want to go and it\u2019s more than money and that\u2019s something that i\u2019d like to get better at as well", "well, i want to underscore something you just said because it\u2019s also something i\u2019m trying to get better at \u2013 this letting people fall on the grass", "and i don\u2019t recall the exact person this came up with but it was someone who\u2019s in the \u201cb club\u201d \u2013 billionaire of some type \u2013 and they explained\u2026 actually, i do remember exactly who it was and it was not somebody, necessarily \u2013 i don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the \u201cb club\u201d but he\u2019s certainly very, very successful \u2013 astro teller", "so he\u2019s the head of x, formerly googlex", "this is google\u2019s moonshot factory \u2013 i guess now alphabet\u2019s moonshot factory \u2013 where they are working on things like loon, and contact lenses that can act as glucometers, and all these really incredible bets on the future", "and he was describing how, in his organization, people would come to him for conflict resolution and he would make a point of insisting \u2013 even though it would take a lot more time \u2013 that they figure out how to solve it, themselves, because he said, \u201cif i step in and i solve your conflict, i\u2019m the parent you come to for the quick and easy path \u2013 you will always come to me \u2013 and i need to train you to actually develop the skillset of handling this dispute, this type of conflict, on your own.\u201d what about you, josh", "you\u2019re an introspective guy", "you\u2019re very good a blocking out time for deep work \u2013 i think something that i try to emulate to the extent possible when i\u2019m not running around scattershot 24/7", "what do the last days of a year and first few days of a year look like or mean to you", "i think that\u2019s a particularly intense question for me right now because i, first of all, just turned 40 a few days ago and i took off for costa rica and surfed some big waves on my 40th and i was reflecting on the year quite a bit", "and i came extremely close to dying a year ago, as we\u2019ve discussed", "[crosstalk] i thought you were going to say again", "i was\u2026 [crosstalk] i was\u2026 no", "just \u2013 [crosstalk] no", "like there\u2019s a pattern here", "just can i just pause for a second \u2013 [crosstalk] although, on the one-wheel, i came really close a couple weeks ago, too, but nothing like this", "yeah", "the shallow water blackout", "yeah", "and i think most of you have heard me speak about it with tim on the podcast last time he pulled me onto it but, long story short, i was doing this breath-hold work and cold water immersion work and i made the mistake of doing it in the water", "i\u2019ve been a lifetime freediver but not doing hypoxic breath work", "and i didn\u2019t know, even though i\u2019d been freediving my whole life, that it is actually carbon dioxide that gave me the urge to breathe because i\u2019d never done breathwork that would actually wipe all the carbon dioxide out of my system", "and so i went from this ecstatic state to passing out, blacking out, underwater \u2013 shallow water blackout", "and i was in the bottom of the pool for three and a half minutes plus after blacking out before someone pulled me out and all the doctors said 45 to 60 seconds, i should be braindead or dead", "so i\u2019ve been reflecting on this year through the lens of that experience and it\u2019s been\u2026 so, as i mentioned to you before, i\u2019ve had this year of just waves of love, gratitude, and beauty flowing through me and i\u2019ve never felt a more powerful dedication to every moment in life and to living life as fully as i can possibly live it", "and a core lesson \u2013 you asked about lesson \u2013 for me, that i think about it broadly and across disciplines is how insanely important it is to be focused on the most important question and to know what it is", "and, in this situation, i had a technical oversight", "i wasn\u2019t present to the most important question which is carbon dioxide is what gives you the urge to breathe", "but, when you work with brilliant investors, for example, there\u2019s no better way to train someone than developing their ability to focus on the most important question", "it\u2019s the same thing with chess players \u2013 know where to look \u2013 or martial artists \u2013 know where to focus on", "the great ones aren\u2019t the ones who focus on more \u2013 they focus on less, actually, and better", "and so that lesson for me, which i\u2019ve applied to intellectual and physical disciplines my whole life, i blew it on in this critical moment of my life and so it feels much more potent to me", "the most important question in \u201cx\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a project, or challenge, or problem, whatever it might be \u2013 i know that you have a very consistent journaling practice so do you keep that question present so that you don\u2019t make, for instance, mistakes like that", "using journaling or how do you go about ensuring that you don\u2019t miss that most critical thing when you need it most", "well, as you know, my journaling system is based around studying complexity, reducing the complexity down to \u201cwhat is the most important question?\u201d sleeping on it, and then waking up in the morning, first thing, and pre-input brainstorming on it", "so i\u2019m feeding my unconscious material to work on, releasing it completely, and then opening up my mind and riffing on it", "and then\u2026 you were going to say something", "i was", "yeah", "you saw me pursing my lips like a goldfish so here we go", "the question that i had was could you give somebody an example of the type of thing you would drop into your mind so that you can digest it overnight", "could you give us an example or examples of the types of things that you might use", "yeah, i actually, at this point \u2013 i\u2019ve been doing this for 27 years, personally \u2013 and now i use question somewhat metaphorically", "so, often, studying complexity, if i\u2019m going to be working with someone, i\u2019ll study a 20-page psychological diagnostic that someone\u2019s responded to and then i will just release it completely and that whole thing will be the question", "and then i\u2019ll wake up and sit with it, or i\u2019ll do a workout and sit with it, and i\u2019ll just see what arises \u2013 what core patterns, what core themes, what core blockages did i pick up in all of that", "right", "because the unconscious is so much more powerful at studying complexity than the conscious mind", "and are you then just jotting these observations or emergent thoughts down on paper", "do you capture them in that way", "yeah", "oh, and i actually use evernote", "you do", "god, i\u2019m riffing on evernote", "no, but there\u2019s often a question as well", "i find that most great thinkers are slicing through complexity like a knife through butter and then they arrive in an area of stuckness and they\u2019ll spend a long time on that stuckness", "and they can spend, consciously at that point, days, weeks, and months, at that stuck point", "but they can also study everything involved with that stuck point, sleep on it, wake up, and just slice right through it", "so, for me, the question is usually that area of stuckness after i\u2019ve studied all the complexity, and that rhythm between consciously integrating technical information into my being, and then releasing it, and then seeing what arises is a huge part of how i approach creativity", "and, for those people who haven\u2019t heard my conversation with reid hoffman \u2013 founder or at least co-founder of linkedin who\u2019s called \u201cthe oracle of silicon valley,\u201d oftentimes, by a players in silicon valley \u2013 he has a nearly identical process", "but he, i believe, he does it, effectively right before bed \u2013 you do not", "am i right", "[crosstalk] no", "okay", "could you explain your rationale for when you sort of infuse your mind with, say, some particular problem \u2013 data set challenge, whatever it might be \u2013 and let it go", "what time do you do that and why", "in my experience \u2013 and reid hoffman\u2019s awesome and i\u2019m sure what he has is just crushing it for him \u2013 but, for me and for people that i\u2019ve worked with, i\u2019ve seen the pattern that, if they\u2019re thinking about it right before bed, they\u2019re actually thinking about it consciously and they\u2019re not releasing the conscious mind which is a huge part of that", "right", "so, if you think about hemingway\u2019s core principle that you were speaking about in that podcast you did about our best tips \u2013 or whatever you called it \u2013 josh waitzkin distilled", "that was my headline", "yeah", "it\u2019s just the core hemingway principle of writing and then finishing his workday leaving something left to write", "right", "as opposed to tapping the well, finishing it all up, which most people who are externally driven in what they\u2019re doing or thinking about how they\u2019re looking, or move by guilt as opposed to something more intrinsic, they feel guilty if they don\u2019t do everything that they have to do versus hemingway\u2019s principle about doing just that", "it\u2019s very interesting but he would always speak about \u2013 and i read this when i was 11 years old which is a big part of my foundation, i think, in this habit \u2013 he\u2019d speak about the importance of stopping your thinking at that point", "then he would relax, he would drink wine, he would release the day", "he drank a lot of wine", "and, also, for me, as a chess player, i found that, if i study chess openings up until bed, i was thinking chess positions", "if i studied it earlier and then released it, then i was able to dream about the insight", "so, for you now, earlier, goes that generally mean end of workday, pre-dinner", "end of workday, pre-dinner, yeah", "and i usually have a workout post-workday \u2013 like, right immediately at the end of my workday, i have some kind of exercise to do to flush my physiology \u2013 so it\u2019s before that workout", "okay", "we\u2019re going to come back to the workout but i want to rotate", "i could spend seven hours with each of these guys", "and we have spent seven hours together, certainly", "adam, what i\u2019d love to know \u2013 and i\u2019ve wanted to actually ask you this for quite a while \u2013 is, in your calendar, say, your weekly calendar, do you have any particular things blocked out or that occur on a weekly basis that are particularly important to you", "i know that\u2019s super specific so if nothing jumps to mind\u2026 well, nothing jumps to mind", "i advise clients, very large hedge funds, on all global asset classes \u2013 so equities, currencies, bonds, commodities \u2013 and it\u2019s 24/7", "and, by the way, it starts sunday night which is when markets open up in china", "so there\u2019s a brief window in the sense that, what josh does about consciously turning off his mind, i do that about 3:00 on friday and, for the next 24 hours, i make a point of not thinking about global markets", "and then, already, come sunday morning, i have to get ready to hit the ground running", "and so that\u2019s usually when i get my ideas is sunday because i\u2019ve given the week over on saturday to just unconscious dreaming and then i have to hit the ground running", "what do the first few hours of sunday look like", "do you have any particular morning routines or anything \u2013 boot-up sequences that you use for yourself", "work out, meditate \u2013 josh introduced me to heartrate variability training which is outstanding", "i\u2019m the kind of person who can\u2019t sit still for normal meditating", "so what does your meditation look like", "it\u2019s just heartrate variability training", "i just watch my heartrate for 20 minutes and do it a couple times a day", "got it", "so i start off the day with that", "so it\u2019s like the cardiac equivalent of biofeedback or neurofeedback", "[crosstalk] yes", "and the workout \u2013 what is the workout", "weights \u2013 very intense, get it over with \u2013 and then sometimes cycling", "and then i start to write down what i expect to happen", "i think the key to, certainly, investing is to have expectations and then wait to be surprised", "and one of the key things with investing \u2013 i don\u2019t know how many of you invest but i think this is a life truism \u2013 is to be aware when you hear a voice in your head that says \u2013 and you\u2019ll usually squint your eyes or you\u2019ll hear someone say the following words \u2013 \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d and it\u2019s always a sign of something really powerful", "so, if somebody says to me, \u201cit doesn\u2019t make any sense why gold keeps going lower,\u201d i know that it\u2019s got a lot lower to go because what that person just said, in saying it doesn\u2019t make sense, is this person has a dozen logical reasons why gold ought to be going higher and it\u2019s going lower and he says that doesn\u2019t make sense but the world always makes sense \u2013 what doesn\u2019t make sense is his model", "and this also applies in life", "in june, about a year ago, donald trump announced his candidacy and i think his first thing was, \u201cwe\u2019re putting up a wall and they\u2019re going to pay for it,\u201d and his numbers shot up in the polls", "and somebody said to me \u2013 and i heard pundits on tv saying \u2013 \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d and i thought, \u201coh my god", "wait.\u201d but that\u2019s precisely it \u2013 it means it\u2019s going higher", "if a stock goes up and there\u2019s no rational reason, it means that there\u2019s some x factor that you haven\u2019t considered because it makes total sense now, in retrospect, but then it didn\u2019t", "so, whenever you hear someone say something doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 i was talking to sam zell, a great real estate investor and all he does is he reads the newspaper and all he\u2019s looking for are things that don\u2019t make sense", "so i said, \u201cgive me an example, sam,\u201d and he says, \u201cokay", "i\u2019m reading the newspaper and i see that there\u2019s a starbucks that\u2019s just opened up,\u201d \u2013 this is 15, 20 years ago \u2013 \u201cin mongolia.\u201d right", "and he thinks to himself, \u201cmongolia", "i thought they drank tea", "what\u2019s with that?\u201d he\u2019s so curious about this because it makes no sense that he takes his private jet, flies to mongolia, and he discovers that they\u2019ve started mining", "this was the beginning of the big china infrastructure build and the only reason he knew about it is it didn\u2019t make any sense", "so i\u2019m telling that\u2019s the key thing", "people stumble on these ideas and then they dismiss them because they go, \u201coh, it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d and i\u2019m telling you that\u2019s where the goldmine is, things that don\u2019t make sense", "i love it", "that\u2019s all i pay attention to now", "and, on sundays, when you\u2019re trying to come up with expectations or, i suppose educated or just hunch \u2013 [crosstalk] and i\u2019m looking for things that don\u2019t make sense", "no, understood", "there are so many things in my life that don\u2019t make sense but this isn\u2019t a therapy session yet", "wait until the tequila comes out", "what is the timeline", "are you looking for things that day or are you looking at things that might occur over a longer time horizon", "sometimes, i\u2019ve set expectations weeks or months prior and then i wait to see that things unfold as i expected", "and, if not, you have to revise your hypothesis", "and so one of the reasons i wanted adam to be onstage is because we hadn\u2019t had a real chance to catch up in a while and i was like, \u201cwell, why don\u2019t we just do it in front of 900 people?\u201d so the question that i know we\u2019ve chatted about just a little bit but you have such an eclectic background \u2013 so you have the princeton review, you have the chess, and now global markets \u2013 what makes you good those different fields", "you\u2019re a very humble guy but, if we were talking to your closest friends and we asked them, \u201cwhat is his superpower or what are the unique abilities or combination of abilities that have made him good in these very seemingly unrelated fields?\u201d what would they say or what would you say", "well\u2026 hmm", "i might have to pull in josh for this", "[crosstalk] i can help with that", "[crosstalk] i\u2019m a heretic so i always approach things to disrupt the order and i start with looking for things that no one else will spot", "and there are two places that i know people don\u2019t prospect and i\u2019ve already told you the first \u2013 things that don\u2019t make sense \u2013 and the second is things that are really obvious", "if it\u2019s obvious, no one bothers to examine it", "and so, in global markets, i start from the premise that understanding is an illusion and that explanation is impossible", "the world is simply too complex to understand so i don\u2019t bother trying", "and all i do is i watch investors attempt to make sense of the world and they form views", "so they\u2019re looking at the world trying to predict what\u2019s going to happen and all i\u2019m doing is studying them because they\u2019re the ones who are going to make buy and sell decisions and affect asset prices", "so they study the world, i\u2019m behind them \u2013 it\u2019s like playing poker in \u2013 [crosstalk] i was going to say, \u201cdon\u2019t play the hand", "play the person across from you\u201d", "exactly", "and so i see the hands that global investors are playing so i don\u2019t try to understand the world \u2013 i just try to get into their heads the same way i did with chess, right, getting into the head or the position of the other player, and in the sat, getting into the head of the test", "this is worth sharing", "it\u2019ll take about 30 seconds", "we\u2019ve got plenty of time", "i went to wharton undergrad and i got a law degree at oxford", "i came back to new york and i thought that what i wanted to do was write screenplays", "so i go to a friend of my father\u2019s and he said, \u201cso what are you going to do now, kid?\u201d and, all expectation, i said, \u201ci\u2019m going to be a writer.\u201d just like that \u2013 full of expectation, a recent grad", "and this guy was one of the top producers on broadway ever, of all time, and he looks at me for about a minute, doesn\u2019t say a thing, and then he says, \u201cwell, then, if you\u2019re going to be a writer, i guess you better have something to say.\u201d and i, \u201coh, shit", "what do i know", "i\u2019m 25", "i have nothing to say.\u201d and i thought, \u201cokay, well, i have to support myself somehow and, while i\u2019m writing\u2026\u201d i knew, if i went to wall street or worked at a law firm, i would never find the time to write and so i thought, \u201ci know what i\u2019ll do", "i\u2019ll tutor kids.\u201d and i thought, \u201cwell, what could i tutor them in?\u201d and i go, \u201coh, i know \u2013 the sat.\u201d now, you don\u2019t this but, back then, nobody was getting tutored", "and i wrote to every private high school in new york \u2013 and i remember there were 31 at the time because i had to type 31 letters, the same letter 31 times", "it\u2019s like \u201cdear dalton,\u201d or \u201cdear spence, i just graduated", "if you have any students who want to prepare for the sats, send them my way.\u201d and, out of that mass mailing, i got one student \u2013 just a single student", "and so i gave her a practice test", "i said, \u201cyou do this and we\u2019ll go over it,\u201d and what was fascinating was that she got all the easy questions right and all the medium questions right but she missed every single hard question \u2013 every single one", "and, just closing your eyes and guessing, you get one in five \u2013 she was batting zero and she was really smart", "i said, \u201coh, joanne, what are you\u2026?\u201d \u2013 i still remember her name, joanne \u2013 and i said, \u201cjoanne, could you just tell me your thinking process?\u201d and what was fascinating is she crossed off, let\u2019s say, choices a, b, and c, got it down to d and e, and whichever one she chose, the answer was the other one", "and i said, \u201cjoanne, could you just explain the logic?\u201d \u2013 again, trying to get into her head, always about getting into the head", "it\u2019s all about appearances, it\u2019s all about thinking \u2013 there is no reality", "plato would have made a lousy investor", "anyway, to get back to joanne \u2013 [crosstalk] short plato", "short plato, exactly", "so she says, \u201cwell, i cross off the ones that i know are wrong.\u201d i said, \u201cgood, good", "then what do you do?\u201d she said, \u201cwell, i pick the one that i think is right.\u201d so i blurted out, \u201cwell, you got to pick the one you think is wrong,\u201d and then i realized, \u201coh, right", "i just cracked the sat", "the only reason a hard question is hard is because whatever seems plausible can\u2019t be right", "that\u2019s why it\u2019s a hard question,\u201d and that was my first insight", "and then her score shoots up, she tells a bunch of friends, and their scores shoot up \u2013 10 students, 100, 200", "then i teamed with a guy and then we started the princeton review \u2013 john katzman", "[crosstalk] so who was \u2013 and i really apologize if i\u2019m misattributing this \u2013 but was there a sort of fictional character that you used to typify\u2026", "yeah", "so i said \u2013 because i didn\u2019t want to hurt\u2026 so you get schizophrenic\u2026 because then she would think, \u201cokay, well, i think that\u2019s right, therefore, it\u2019s wrong", "but, wait a second.\u201d she\u2019d get into a feedback loop", "right", "this is like every day of my life", "your brain would explode", "so, when i was at oxford, my don always referred to blogs as \u201cthe man on the street.\u201d so i thought i would americanize them", "so i said, \u201coh, okay", "ask yourself, \u2018what would joe bloggs do?\u2019 and, whatever he would do on a hard question, you do the opposite.\u201d and, by the way, if you\u2019re stuck on an easy question \u2013 the ones at the beginning \u2013 you follow whatever joe bloggs would do", "and, by the way, the test, because of these techniques, they had to change the sat because of the stuff i was doing", "that\u2019s how you know you\u2019re doing something right, i suppose", "eh", "but it\u2019s very different now so you can\u2019t use those techniques", "they\u2026 did you ever cause irreparable harm to someone who actually had the last name bloggs", "i don\u2019t know", "okay", "alright", "i hope not", "just wondering", "do you mind if i throw in one question to dig in on adam a little", "sure", "then i have a whole slew for our silent partner here", "so one of the things that\u2019s so amazing about adam is how prolific he is and how high quality it all is", "and he\u2019s in this realm of economics in which maybe one of the first principles is, \u201cdon\u2019t speak publicly about one of your views because then you\u2019ll get locked into it and the world will change your mind,\u201d and yet he\u2019s able to", "and so one of the things i think might be really interesting to hear you talk about is how do you avoid falling into constructs yourself when you\u2019re giving advice so consistently", "ah, because i never have views on the market", "i\u2019m always agnostic so all i\u2019m doing is reporting how the market is positioned to respond", "so, for example, 13 months ago, early november, u.s", "interest rates \u2013 i don\u2019t know if this will make any sense to you but \u2013 were 2.32 percent on the u.s", "10 year and janet yellen was due to raise interest rates five weeks later", "this was, again, about a year ago", "and i sent out an alert to my clients saying that interest rates were about to plunge to multi-year lows and they said, \u201cthat makes no sense.\u201d and i said, \u201cprecisely,\u201d but i gave them the logic and they understood the logic", "it\u2019s because one group of traders in the world has never been wrong about predicting interest rates and it\u2019s now who you would think \u2013 well, i\u2019ll tell you: it\u2019s metals traders", "they\u2019re always right about interest rates", "anyway, so, once a client asked me\u2026 i said, \u201crates are going lower,\u201d and he said, \u201cwell, what would you need to see to change your view?\u201d oh, that\u2019s a good question", "it\u2019s the best question ever", "right", "it\u2019s the scientific method", "if you can\u2019t falsify your hypothesis, you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true", "if you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re wrong, you certainly don\u2019t know when you\u2019re right", "so i said, \u201coh, well, if we see copper versus gold rally sharply, then rates will rally", "but, if copper/gold is going lower, then interest rates are going to go lower,\u201d and they plunged", "she raised rates in december and, by july; they were at all-time lows which made no sense, certainly, to janet yellen", "she was expecting them to go higher and they went lower", "so, always, that\u2019s the key thing with anything", "and, probably, you could apply that question to relationships like, \u201cthis is what i think", "well, what would i need to see to set that up?\u201d \u2013 you set up that marker ahead of time because, otherwise, confirmation bias will come in and you\u2019ll start to rationalize", "yeah, well, you\u2019ll not only have confirmation bias, but then you might even have \u2013 depending on the position you take \u2013 some type of sunk cost fallacy and just start layering problem upon problem", "[crosstalk] right", "and it\u2019s also, by the way just as a side note, a great way to avoid debates or arguments that will go absolutely nowhere, if you ask someone \u2013 slightly different but \u2013 \u201cis there anything i could say that would lead you to change your mind about x?\u201d if that\u2019s what they want to have a debate about", "if they say no, then you\u2019re like, \u201cgreat", "i\u2019m going to go get a burrito", "you can argue with this empty chair because it\u2019s a pointless exercise to begin with.\u201d it\u2019s such an important question", "ramit, you\u2019ve really intelligently run, from my perspective, the company you\u2019ve built and set policies in place, and really made a study of management", "and i\u2019ve watched you refine it over time where you\u2019ve not only become more successful as a company and organization but you\u2019ve become more relaxed and you seem like you have as much bandwidth as you\u2019d care to have even though your default is just jamming, jamming, jamming", "what are some of the most important decisions or different decisions you wish you had made in the early days when you were hiring the very first people, let\u2019s say", "oh, the first things first, i wish that i had understood it\u2019s okay to let people make their own mistakes and the idea that i don\u2019t have to be instrumental in every single decision", "now, we have a much bigger idea and a much more refined concept of big wins", "focus on the big things in life like, for example, the thing that a lot of people might have heard me say is, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about lattes.\u201d right", "this is a classic thing in personal finance", "everyone says, \u201coh my god", "don\u2019t spent $3.00 on lattes,\u201d which is the worst possible advice you can ever listen to because we have limited cognition \u2013 limited willpower \u2013 and we don\u2019t want to waste that precious resource on a $3.00 purchase", "right", "get the big things right in life and you don\u2019t need to worry about that", "i wish i would have applied that earlier on in the business to the people that i started working with", "that was sort of unconventional", "the other thing that was very conventional was hire great people, fire fast \u2013 the things you sort of hear thrown around", "everybody hears it, everybody nods, and everybody ignores it until it happens to them", "so every one of my friends who runs a business, we get together behind closed doors and everyone talks about the mistakes they made where they should have listened to typical advice", "and i think one of the problems if you get any level of success is that you start to think those basic rules don\u2019t apply to you when, in reality, they apply to you more than ever", "so it\u2019s very important to just remember just get the basics right", "and, if you get the basics right in life, you don\u2019t have to worry about often optimizing at the margins", "life works pretty well if you have a good job, if you have good relationships, if you have a solid roof over your head \u2013 things are pretty good and that\u2019s a good basic thing", "yeah, not majoring in minor things and this is a lesson i had to learn for myself \u2013 well, i\u2019ve had to learn for myself repeatedly \u2013 letting the small bad things happen to get the \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah", "it\u2019s got to happen", "[crosstalk] \u2013 huge good things done", "on the front of hiring, are there any particular books or resources\u2026", "i know there\u2019s a book called who that a lot of the startup ceos that i know have found very helpful which is sort of a distilled version of topgrading", "were there any particular resources or bits of advice\u2026", "i know you\u2019ve done quite a bit with jay abraham but maybe not on the hiring front", "what were the resources \u2013 books or otherwise \u2013 that you found most helpful, if any", "i wish i could recommend one but\u2026 and this is something that i hear from a lot of friends who are starting to hire and build their teams \u2013 they have 10, 15, 20 people and they\u2019re starting to realize, \u201chey, this is actually pretty important.\u201d and they come to me and they go, \u201ci want to hire a project manager", "how do i hire the best project manager?\u201d and i say, \u201cbasically, get ready to eat shit for the next two years because it\u2019s really hard and there\u2019s no great book that\u2019s going to lay it out because it is inherently complex and messy", "and the fact of the matter is the first hire you make is going to be not good", "the second\u2019s not good", "the fifth\u2026 but, eventually, you\u2019re going to learn what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d and, by the way, it would be different from my company than another company", "we did a partnership with this other company and they start their meetings off by doing a cheer and they sing songs and our company does not do that", "okay", "ramit\u2019s company starts with ritual \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah", "we sing \u201ckumbaya.\u201d yeah", "and that\u2019s great", "their company is awesome and our company is awesome in our own way", "so nothing i could say would help them except the best advice i could give them is, \u201cyou have to go through the fire", "you\u2019ve got to do it", "you\u2019re going to make mistakes so just kind of accept that.\u201d it reminds me of this story that the director/writer/musician/polymath robert rodriguez told me where he goes to these film festivals and he\u2019s had all these huge blockbusters now and film students or would-be filmmakers come up to him and they go, \u201cyeah, i want to do this but this happened and then we didn\u2019t have enough money for that", "and, well, you know you can\u2019t do a, b, and c because this happened,\u201d and he said what they don\u2019t realize is that\u2019s the job of a filmmaker \u2013 nothing is going to work and it\u2019s up to you", "that is the starting point \u2013 literally, the job description begins with, \u201cnothing is going to work, and then you have to figure it out.\u201d now, i want to talk to you a little bit about something we were chatting about in the green room which i think you\u2019re particularly good at and that is interacting with haters and belligerent people on the internet", "so \u2013 what", "i\u2019ve never had anyone send me an email like that in my life", "so some people like golf, some people like boxing, some people, i don\u2019t know, badminton \u2013 you like interacting with belligerent people on the internet", "love it", "i do it with every single one", "[crosstalk] so can you describe for us the rules of engagement and sort of best practices for this sport", "okay", "let me break it down for you", "everybody, listen up because you\u2019re going to get one of these people in your life, i\u2019ll tell you that right now", "first of all \u2013 [crosstalk] this is so twisted", "it is very, very sadistic", "okay, when do you get the chance to talk to somebody who runs up to you in the street and says like, \u201cf you\u201d", "never", "it never happens because people don\u2019t do that in the street", "right", "but, online, they do it all the time", "yeah", "and then i think about how i don\u2019t really feel much at risk because, if i went to a comedy show \u2013 if i go to comedy cellar \u2013 i would never dream of heckling the comedian because that\u2019s their job", "they\u2019re always going to win", "so i sit there politely, and i listen, and i laugh, and then i leave", "when somebody comes in and sends you a message but you see 50 or 100 of them a day, there\u2019s no chance of them winning", "and, actually, so i love it because i get the chance to interact with someone i normally would never interact with", "if you play it right, you can get to see inside their mind and actually learn something pretty interesting", "sometimes, they might leave it at just, \u201cf you,\u201d but, over time, i\u2019ve come to realize it\u2019s very mathematical", "of 100 people that email me, they\u2019ll say something like, \u201cf you,\u201d or whatever, just very directly \u2013 [crosstalk] just to translate, that\u2019s burmese", "it\u2019s \u201cfuck you.\u201d and i\u2019ll say something like, \u201cwhy?\u201d because what you need to do at this point is you need to bring it down", "you need to tone it down", "okay", "[crosstalk] yeah", "or i\u2019ll say, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong", "are you having a bad hair day?\u201d and then it\u2019s very fascinating what happens next", "so 50 percent of people never respond", "you guys find that interesting", "they sent you this email; you respond back, they don\u2019t respond at all so what\u2019s up with that", "and, if you really wanted to find out, you could re-reply a day later and track that", "so what is up with that", "okay, i\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s\u2026 okay, so 25 percent of people are going to double down and get really, really angry, in which case, you double down and put a picture of someone with a really bad hair day and now they don\u2019t know what to do", "25 percent \u2013 and this is why it was all worth it \u2013 they go, \u201coh my god, i didn\u2019t know you were actually going to read this,\u201d and now you have a discussion", "right", "now you can find out why they sent that", "and this happens to me all the time \u2013 i cannot even tell you how often \u2013 and it is so fascinating to get the chance to talk to someone who\u2019s been on my email list for, say, four years and never have written me", "they\u2019ve literally gotten tens of thousands of pages of material we\u2019ve sent them for free and the first thing they wrote was \u201cf you.\u201d i go, \u201cwhat\u2019s up", "why\u2019d you say that?\u201d and some random joke i made on page 3 of this email really set them off and they just had to write back", "they had to write back and, most of them, they still say, \u201ci didn\u2019t think anyone would actually read it.\u201d i find it so fascinating that, in the world where we are so connected to other people, there\u2019s so many people that feel that no one is actually listening that they would sent an email knowing that no one\u2019s going to read it \u2013 that\u2019s what they believe \u2013 they would send it with all this emotionally loaded language and they would just send it out there", "but, when someone actually listens, they\u2019re struck and that\u2019s when you can start engaging with them", "i find it totally fascinating", "so another technique, another judo move, that i\u2019ve seen you do on twitter, specifically, which i admire \u2013 and chris sacca is also very good at this, you should check out his technique \u2013 is when someone will be like, \u201chey, fuck you, scam artist", "what the fuck", "ah, get rich, lolz,\u201d and you\u2019ll respond with something like, \u201cinteresting", "i\u2019m intrigued", "tell me more.\u201d and then they don\u2019t know what to do because they\u2019re expecting you to either respond with some anger or respond with something trying to be clever but, instead, you\u2019re like, \u201cinteresting.\u201d okay", "so here\u2019s the thing: people are pattern matching", "right", "if you read cialdini\u2019s book, influence, he talks about \u201cclick, whirr.\u201d you do something and people are going to respond \u2013 very programmatic", "wait, whirr", "it\u2019s like he\u2019s written \u2013 [crosstalk] oh, i got it, whirr", "yeah", "people are programmatic so, if you write someone an angry email, they\u2019re almost always going to write back really angry", "but, for me, there\u2019s no\u2026 i\u2019m not angry at them", "right", "i haven\u2019t done anything", "all they did was send me an email which i\u2019ve seen a thousand other people send", "and i know it\u2019s not me", "i know that because that email that they\u2019re reading got sent out to a million other people and they all loved it so it\u2019s probably not me, \u2013 it\u2019s probably something going on with them, and i want to know", "so, when you sort of respond in a way that\u2019s not the obvious, then, all of a sudden, you shift the entire conversation", "now, if i wrote back and said, \u201cf you,\u201d now that\u2019s what they expected and they feed on that but, when you change the whole dynamic, i think that\u2019s when you can have a really interesting discussion", "same thing for business, by the way", "if you\u2019re looking at markets where, for example, if you were trying to create another princeton review today or you\u2019re trying to write another personal finance book, you probably don\u2019t want to go with the same \u201cclick, whirr\u201d programmatic strategy", "you want to try to analyze what is missing in the market, how are people not being taken care of or responded to instead of going with the same thing that everyone else is doing", "so, josh, i want to ask you a question", "are you famous on the internet for handling haters well", "i don\u2019t even\u2026 i barely know what the internet is but this is actually a really great fight principle", "now, i don\u2019t have any experience interacting with haters on the internet but i do have quite a bit of experience interacting with people who essentially say that in person", "wait\u2026 what", "wait", "so you opt not to be on facebook but then you go out and find people who are going to say, \u201cfuck you,\u201d in person", "what do you\u2026", "where do you\u2026", "[crosstalk] no, i\u2019m talking about competing in martial arts", "[crosstalk] oh, i see", "alright", "[crosstalk] and so it\u2019s amazing\u2026 i spent years training at how to deal with fighting dirty opponents \u2013 so people who, in some kind of martial arts exchange, after the bell, will target your eyes \u2013 [crosstalk] or chess", "yeah", "chess is like kicking you under the table or cheating with talking to a coach in the chess world but, in martial arts, it\u2019s a little bit less subtle", "they\u2019ll actually try to kick you in the balls or take out your knees in between rounds \u2013 it gets pretty wild \u2013 or targeting your eyes, neck", "and, initially, it will throw you off but i trained for years \u2013 because i had to win national world championships \u2013 you knew you had to deal with these guys and be at your best when they\u2019re at their worst", "and so i spent a lot of years bringing in the dirtiest players you could find and learning how to play with them in the gym", "and then i remember this time in the 2002 world championships in taiwan, i was fighting this austrian guy and he was just the textbook dirty player", "he was trying to bust my knees up after the bell, he hit me too solid \u2013 like straight up groin shots which were well-placed \u2013 but i\u2019d done all this training at this and so i was focusing very purely and i was smiling at him which is kind of your move", "and he was so used to people responding to his dirty play with anger that, when i didn\u2019t give it to him and i smiled at him, he got desperate and he kept on doing more and more outrageous things", "and, when i responded with no emotion, at the end of the fight, he was basically throwing himself on the floor", "he was completely destroying himself because he needed my response like a leg \u2013 that was a leg he was used to leaning on", "and so i think your principle is brilliant and i practice the in-person version of it", "it\u2019s a lot\u2026 it\u2019s interesting how much they apply", "and, also, i noticed something you just off-handedly said is that you trained with dirtier players and that\u2019s something you\u2019ll find true of a lot of people who are at the top of their game \u2013 they find something that is interesting that is helping them develop and then they will actively seek it out", "like what person in their right mind would seek out dirty players and fight against them", "only someone who wants to be the best", "well, it\u2019s a very interesting thing that happens in different forms of competition which is that, if somebody plays outside the rules, the typical response is righteous indignation", "right", "because that person isn\u2019t playing by these rules which are arbitrary rules, anyway", "so the weakness of almost any martial artist is the dogma of his sport", "right", "and we could go through different martial arts like judo guys, for example, are incredible fighters but the rules of judo is that you can\u2019t lie on your back and so they\u2019ll turn themselves and land on their stomach in the middle of a throw which, as you know, exposes their back to being choked out in a real fight", "right", "or jiu jitsu guys might have a bias against footlocks, right, or might not be such good strikers", "or, like in chinese martial arts, people believe it\u2019s not honorable to fight on the ground", "so you build all this \u2013 you kind of make a cult of your inhibitions and you \u2013 [crosstalk] make a cult of your inhibitions", "yeah, i think that actually comes from\u2026 i think my dad used that line in one of his books", "i think it\u2019s a great term because people basically have some kind of insecurity or some kind of inhibition and they build a cult out of it and they protect it instead of taking it on and sort of finding the dirty player to go at your neck and your eyes", "and so, for example, as a fighter, the way that this manifests is that, if someone starts targeting your adam\u2019s apple and your eyeballs and you don\u2019t know how to deal with it, you\u2019re going to be furious because you don\u2019t know technically how to deal with it but, if you\u2019re trained with how to deal with it, then you\u2019re not going to have that emotional reaction", "so we\u2019ve talked about fighting austrians", "i want to talk about dancing bears", "this is going somewhere, bear with me", "i\u2019m not on lsd", "yet", "no, that\u2019s a joke", "don\u2019t try this at home, kids", "we\u2019re trained professionals on a closed course", "so josh is a recluse \u2013 is that fair", "yeah", "just go with it", "[crosstalk] so josh, when he\u2019s not fighting dirty austrians, he prefers to be left alone for the most part", "occasionally, i\u2019ll drag him out to do something like this, in part because he will most certainly text me the next day and go, \u201cyou fucking fuck", "you fucking fuck,\u201d which i find endearing", "but he does not engage on the internet, does zero media, and i admire that because you\u2019re able to get a lot of deep work done and it\u2019s a challenge for me", "i\u2019m able to do it but it takes a lot more effort because i\u2019ve exposed myself, not in a criminal way but in a public way", "and could you explain\u2026", "so we will sometimes joke when we\u2019re forced \u2013 or volunteer, in my case \u2013 to do something in front of a lot of people or to do something like a speaking engagement like, \u201cdance, baby, dance,\u201d and we\u2019ll talk about the bear", "so could you give us some context on where this came from", "yeah", "so i have some history with this theme because, when i was 11 years old, my dad\u2019s book, searching for bobby fisher, came out and then, when i was 15 years old, the movie came out and it was a big deal and so i was thrust into this mainstream media spotlight without asking to be", "and that was in the middle of my chess career so i had this deep love for this art and i was so passionate about it, but i had so much attention on me that i found myself getting pulled into this externalized relationship with my first love and it was heartbreaking and i didn\u2019t have the internal tools to resist that pull", "and i\u2019ve had several times in my life where i\u2019ve kind of had to do some\u2026 so i used to develop this computer chess program called \u201cchessmaster\u201d and i had to do press things for that and i wrote the art of learning and i had to do this big\u2026 what you\u2019re all doing now and which you\u2019re awesome at", "and, during that time, i got pulled in with a public speaking tour quite a bit because everyone wanted to\u2026 the thing is that nothing really calcifies the growth process, in my opinion, like people who are on the speaking tour because they\u2019re being asked to speak about the same ideas that they spoke about the year before, and the year before, and wrote about three years ago, and as opposed to breaking new ground", "and i\u2019m personally allergic to anything that will calcify or slow down my growth process because i love learning more than i love anything and so i have this ingrained allergy to anything that externalizes my relationship to the game", "so the last public keynote address that i ever gave was a lot of years ago", "some speaking agency convinced me to work with them and i was doing some talks", "and i was conflicted about it and i had all these ethical constraints on them, and they talked me to going to this event in florida", "what were the ethical constraints", "just that i would only work with beautiful companies that were helping the world and were awesome", "they were like, \u201coh, one of these guys.\u201d \u201cone of these guys.\u201d so they just completely bullshit me about what i was going to go do and i went out to florida thinking i was working with this group they told me was donating all these medical supplies to countries in africa and i thought it was awesome and beautiful", "it turns out i was going to the national sales convention of this big group and i just was literally the follow-up act to a monkey on stage", "and i was speaking \u2013 [crosstalk] a literal monkey", "[crosstalk] it was actually a monkey", "there was a monkey on stage that was doing, \u201care you smarter than a monkey?\u201d or something", "and i live my life in the realm that authenticity is the most important thing to me and i was going to speak about my pain, and my ideas from chess and martial arts, and stuff that i love and then i was just feeling this wild hilarity of being the follow-up act to a monkey and being just\u2026 that was where the dancing bear thing came from", "so that was the last keynote address i ever gave", "and so now, i only do public things, frankly, with you", "i think, for the last many, many years, that\u2019s all i\u2019ve done", "and then, if i give a talk, it\u2019s always a q&a which is a dynamic dialogue where i actually can feel like i can learn from because you\u2019re speaking to a small group or a big group of really brilliant people who are all in in their training process and it\u2019s an exploration that i can learn from their questions", "and so that\u2019s where the dancing bear comes from \u2013 the follow-up act to a monkey", "a real monkey", "\u201care you smarter than a monkey?\u201d that\u2019s coming up next, folks, so stand by", "what book, or writer, or it could be thinker has most influenced each of you in the last, say, year", "or someone who\u2019s really just influenced you", "adam, do you have any thoughts on whom or what that might be", "well, i\u2019m always foraging for ideas so, for example, cialdini\u2019s book, influence, but i read far afield because the ideas in investing come from outside the domain", "if you want to have an insight in whatever your field is, it helps to look outside your field", "so i read constantly", "and i read poetry \u2013 i like rumi", "so, actually, i\u2019m going to say rumi because he\u2019s gotten me in touch with the mystical, and the mysterious, and the magical in life", "[crosstalk] do you gift many books", "i\u2019m sorry", "do you gift books to other people", "i gift all the time", "if so, what are your \u2013 [crosstalk] i\u2019m a world champion gift giver", "[crosstalk] what are your\u2026", "it\u2019s really\u2026 [crosstalk] so that\u2019s your domain", "[crosstalk] it\u2019s true", "adam gives so many books, gifts \u2013 it\u2019s amazing \u2013 to me and my son, jack", "he is a world-champion gift giver", "i think that\u2019s absolutely true", "[crosstalk] this is going to be a digression, which is kind of my thing", "so i remember once reading a bedtime story to jack \u2013 long story \u2013 and the book was giraffes can\u2019t dance", "yeah", "and this book, for two weeks, has been just decapitating me on amazon", "this book is a juggernaut", "it is just \u2013 [crosstalk] seriously", "[crosstalk] it is just killing the top ten list on amazon", "every christmas, giraffes can\u2019t dance will kick your ass", "and you just blew it up on your podcast", "i did", "yeah", "i think that\u2019s hadakidi \u2013 i think that\u2019s what that\u2019s called", "jack loves that book", "i will have to delay the publication of this esteemed podcast featuring giraffes can\u2019t dance", "first one\u2019s on me, guys", "come sponsor my podcast", "where the hell was i", "oh, yes", "so you\u2019ve given a lot of books as gifts", "what books have you gifted most often to other people", "is there a short list or just those that come to mind that you\u2019ve gifted more than once", "no, it\u2019s really unique to each person so there\u2019s no one book because each gift reflects something i want to share with that person", "but i would imagine there have to be some generally applicable books that you\u2019ve enjoyed that you\u2019ve given to more than one person", "or is that not the case", "oh, i\u2019d have to think about that", "okay", "we\u2019ll come back", "okay", "yeah, come back to that", "we\u2019ll come back", "[crosstalk] because that\u2019s a tough question", "[crosstalk] we got room in between giraffes can\u2019t dance", "by the way, i can\u2019t let ramit\u2019s \u201cfuck you\u201d thing go", "if any of you want to get in touch with him, you know how to get his attention", "[crosstalk] oh god, what have i done", "so, wait, if you have business opportunities, anything\u2026 and i believe this works well with everyone so\u2026 [crosstalk] thanks so much", "and, if you want josh to do a speaking engagement, you have to practice your dirty fighting skills and figure out how to throw a good \u2013 [crosstalk] kick him in the groin", "yeah", "groin kicks", "that\u2019ll get his attention", "and for all the people who have been asking me to introduce them to josh to do media, he\u2019s not going to do it", "he would rather be fighting, and cooking turkeys, and riding his one-wheel around", "surfing", "and surfing which is a big thing", "so, ramit, what about you in terms of thinkers, or books, or anything, really, that\u2019s influenced your thinking a lot in the last year", "i read a lot of military books", "i think that the military is amazing at building training programs and identifying people who are good and then making them great", "so, especially at the special operations level and, having met some of those folks and doing some work with them, it\u2019s pretty outstanding the way that they can cultivate mastery", "so that\u2019s great", "books i\u2019ve gifted: gift of fear is an amazing book, particularly for women, but i actually think everybody", "learning to trust your intuition \u2013 [crosstalk] gavin de becker", "yeah, gavin de becker", "and he talks about \u2013 [crosstalk] who, by the way, not to interrupt, but he has a company that does very high-end security details for high profile folks", "exactly", "trusting your intuition, knowing when the little antenna at the back of your head goes up, and you can\u2019t see anything, and we so often say, \u201cit\u2019s nothing", "i\u2019m going to walk down that alley or i\u2019m going to just go into my house like normal,\u201d but listen and learn to trust your intuition because we have it but it kind of gets suppressed because we don\u2019t want to be that weird person", "so that\u2019s a great gift", "i can\u2019t recommend it enough", "the two books i wish i could gift more: charlie munger\u2019s\u2026 poor charlie\u2019s almanac", "yeah, poor charlie\u2026 it\u2019s an amazing book on mental models, super dense, and nobody wants to get that book as a gift", "it\u2019s a gift you have to buy, not get gifted", "that one and also breakthrough advertising which i think is one of the most sophisticated books on marketing every written", "it\u2019s super dense", "i read it every year and i learn something new", "who\u2019s the author", "eugene schwartz", "eugene schwarz", "and it\u2019s an amazing, amazing book on copywriting and, really, human psychology but, again, nobody wants to get that as a gift", "look it up and buy it if you want it, but it\u2019s fantastic", "what about you, josh", "and i\u2019ll give you two options here: it could be someone or something that has really changed or informed your thinking in the last year or it could be something you\u2019re really looking into, subject matter-wise, or a particular thinker you\u2019re diving into in the coming year", "well, you and i have talked about books a lot, right, so we\u2019re just going to set that\u2026 [crosstalk] well, we don\u2019t have to\u2026 [crosstalk] yeah", "we\u2019ve done a lot of best books", "[crosstalk] we don\u2019t have to just set the record on the platter and play the same track", "yeah", "but subject matter-wise", "so my foundation of books which we\u2019ve discussed \u2013 laozi, hemingway, jack kerouac, robert pirsig \u2013 these are books that were really important to me recently and we\u2019ve discussed all these so we\u2019re not going to\u2026 [crosstalk] yeah, but i have a question for you about one of them", "which one", "can we jump in", "[crosstalk] yeah, let\u2019s do it", "[crosstalk] so the tao te ching", "tao te ching, yeah", "okay", "so this has come up a lot in the podcast", "a lot of people like it \u2013 rick rubin, yourself \u2013 but, if i recommend that book to, say, ten people, of those ten, two may seem to enjoy it, and eight are like, \u201cwhat is this", "i can\u2019t make any sense out of it", "it\u2019s just like a book of fortune cookies", "what\u2026?\u201d yeah", "it\u2019s so ambiguous", "[crosstalk] \u201cwhat is this", "\u2018there\u2019s no there there.\u2019 what the hell is this?\u201d so what are they missing or how should they read it", "my favorite definition of wisdom comes from the glossary of robert thurman\u2019s translation of the vimalakirti\u00a0sutra and it\u2019s tolerance of cognitive dissonance and that\u2019s what laozi is about", "right", "so, if you read the tao te ching\u2026 first of all, i think it depends on what translation you read", "you need to read, in my opinion, the gia fu-feng and jane english version", "say that one more time", "gia fu-feng and jane english translation of the tao te ching, i think is the most true that i\u2019ve run into and i think i\u2019ve read them all", "i don\u2019t read ancient chinese so i\u2019ve had to kind of circle it", "and a lot of these \u2013 [crosstalk] you\u2019re so lazy, man", "[crosstalk] i almost took up learning ancient chinese years ago for that one purpose but the reason a lot of these translations are sort of thesis statements which take away the ambiguity and i think a lot of people don\u2019t want to tolerate cognitive dissonance", "laozi doesn\u2019t tell you what to do", "it\u2019s \u2013 [crosstalk] okay", "so is it the lack of specific prescription that is kind of almost a warshak test of sense", "you\u2019re looking at the tea leaves and what you see tells you", "how you interpret it tells you what you need to know as opposed to\u2026", "[crosstalk] well, this principle that ramit was speaking about \u2013 the response to aggression with empty space, with non-violence \u2013 this is at the essence of laozi", "for me, it was very important during the period where i was transitioning, where i was dealing with this existential crisis of my chess career where i\u2019d been working with a coach for several years who was urging me to study the opposite style from what was natural to me", "i was being pulled in this externalized relationship to things and it was kind of the entrance into my philosophical exploration of self-expression, of authenticity, of a deeply intrinsic relationship to my search for truth as opposed to being driven by the external \u2013 competing from the inside out as opposed to the outside in", "so it was a big part of my foundation in self-development", "so maybe that\u2019s\u2026 and all those authors that i just mentioned were a huge part of that", "in the last year, i have to tell you, this is a brilliant book", "sam sent me an advanced copy", "this tools of titans is\u2026 i\u2019m not\u2026 tim and i are dear friends \u2013 i love the guy \u2013 but i give him so much shit", "trust me; i\u2019m not saying this if it isn\u2019t true", "it\u2019s a goldmine", "your podcast is brilliant and i believe it\u2019s your calling in a lot of ways, at least in this period of your life, because you\u2019ve taken the art of deconstruction \u2013 which i think is your finest art \u2013 and you\u2019ve developed this medium with which you can study people and get to the essence of them so quickly", "and i\u2019m stunned by how you can have so many conversations that are deeply meaningful and then you can really get to the essence of someone by studying them for a few days or a week", "i couldn\u2019t fucking do that", "it\u2019s a beautiful thing to see", "then you\u2019re bringing it to the world", "you\u2019re gifting the best ideas of a lot of who you consider brilliant people through this podcast but then you have to listen to two, three hour talks \u2013 which is awesome but a lot of people don\u2019t have the patience \u2013 and this is a way of just shortcutting your way in", "and so i think this is actually a goldmine", "i\u2019ve been reading it and loving it myself", "thanks, josh", "i really mean that", "thanks, man", "it\u2019s true, dude", "thanks, man", "i wouldn\u2019t say it if it wasn\u2019t true", "i didn\u2019t slip him a twenty", "he\u2019s an expensive date", "[crosstalk] yeah", "thank you, josh", "another book which i think is really important right now is a buddy of mine who you had on, sebastian junger, his book, tribe", "yes", "100 percent agreed", "yeah", "i thought your interview with him was beautiful", "you guys really\u2026 the introduction of these two guys was hilarious", "the text exchange to get them to loosen their shit up with one another was really funny but, finally, they did and i thought that was a\u2026 sebastian\u2019s been studying evolutionary psychology and\u2026 yes", "so josh introduced us \u2013 [crosstalk] it was ridiculous", "[crosstalk] \u2013 and we were up doing this, \u201cvery nice to meet you, sir.\u201d \u201cyes, good day, sir.\u201d this very kind of weirdly sort of formal exchange \u2013 [crosstalk] \u201chave your publicist talk to my publicist.\u201d [crosstalk] \u2013 and so josh jumped in a few levels down", "he\u2019s like, \u201cguys, loosen the fuck up.\u201d i was like, \u201cokay", "alright.\u201d tribe, i highly, highly recommend", "it\u2019s a great short read", "so i\u2019ve asked people oftentimes \u2013 and we are going to do some q&a in about 12 minutes so hold your horses but we\u2019ll definitely get there shortly \u2013 the question i\u2019ve asked often, and there are many, but is what advice would you give your 30-year-old self or your 20-year-old self", "it tends to produce one or two of the same answers: \u201ci wouldn\u2019t say anything because i wouldn\u2019t want to change where i am,\u201d or, \u201cenjoy it,\u201d is very common", "the question, though, that i\u2019d like to pose is a bit different and it is what advice do you think the happiest version of your 80-year-old self would give you now", "so anyone who wants to tackle that is welcome to give it a shot", "well, let me riff off of something that josh said about \u2013 you were talking about the book where two people love it and eight people are like, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d \u2013 and i think that, in this day and age, we are given so much advice", "and, as someone who is in the advice industry, i see it and i have a healthy disdain for a lot of advice", "and, if you follow the advice that people give you, you\u2019ve got to wake up and, by 3:00 a.m., you\u2019ve got to be hustling, and you need to be doing all this stuff until\u2026 and it\u2019s crazy", "you can\u2019t do all this stuff and feasibly be a normal human being", "i had books that people told me i need to read and i opened them up and i\u2019m like, \u201cthis book is shit", "who the hell\u2026?\u201d but 20 people i like told me to read it", "and then \u2013 [crosstalk] give me an example", "can you think of one", "yes, because i ended up loving it", "so here\u2019s a classic simple example \u2013 [crosstalk] the four-hour workweek", "no", "when i was in my early 20s, i read 22 immutable laws of marketing \u2013 or branding \u2013 and i\u2019m like, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d and i just\u2026 and then i picked it up again when i was 30 and i\u2019m like, \u201cthis is awesome.\u201d i wasn\u2019t ready for it and i\u2019m glad that i gave it another chance because i didn\u2019t have the context", "and i\u2019m willing to bet\u2026 and i\u2019m not saying that i got better \u2013 things just changed and, by the time i was 30, i was ready for it", "i guarantee this book, maybe some of the people just don\u2019t like it and that\u2019s fine, but maybe some of them don\u2019t have the context, or they\u2019re not ready, or it\u2019s just not integral right now", "everybody \u2013 including in the book, which i love \u2013 meditation\u2019s a classic thing and i don\u2019t meditate", "and i try not to feel guilty about it because i don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right time in my life", "i have a very calm mind and i have the ways that i like to enjoy, and all that stuff", "it just doesn\u2019t involve meditation but i\u2019m sure\u2026 because i believe that most of us are basically the same in most parts of life and, if we embrace that, then we can optimize it and we can free up that 2 percent that we\u2019re different and get really unique and special", "i bet you that, as i get a little bit older, i will become more spiritual, i will probably meditate \u2013 these are classic things that happen", "i think if i were 80 years old, i would look back and say, \u201clisten to the advice and hear what people are telling you to do but, if it doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s okay to say, \u2018you know what", "i\u2019m going to put that aside, come back to it in a year or five years, and maybe, at that point, the book will be great or i will be ready to meditate but i just don\u2019t have interest in it right now", "it just doesn\u2019t feel right and that\u2019s okay", "i don\u2019t need to do what everybody else says", "i\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right for me, be a great version of myself, improve, but be really judicious about who you\u2019re listening to and what you\u2019re applying.'\u201d i think, also, you mentioned intuition and the gift of fear", "this is something i\u2019ve really tried hard to resurrect for myself in the last few years because i\u2019ve been driven by pro and con lists, and spreadsheets, and this, that, and the other thing and using my left side of the brain that\u2019s simplistic, obviously, and just trying to use an analytical framework for everything and took a lot of wrong turns", "i\u2019d be like, \u201cthis deal is great,\u201d and i remember at one point ages ago, this girlfriend said to me, \u201cwait, do you trust this guy at all?\u201d i was like, \u201cnot really,\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201coh, jesus.\u201d and then i did the deal and, of course, it was a disaster", "so i think the intuition is also really important to develop an ear for when you\u2019re making those types of decisions to put things aside", "adam", "what would your 80-year-old self tell you now", "well, one of my favorite quotes was by one of my heroes, juan belmonte and juan belmonte was sort of the rocky of bullfighting in the early part of the century", "he fought pre-antibiotics, so even a scratch of a bull\u2019s horn, you could die from that", "they used to call him \u201cthe flying matador\u201d because he was so bad the bulls would just keep tossing him the air but he was really \u2013 [crosstalk] i did not see that coming", "and there\u2019s a quote in there that i love and, actually, one i\u2019d really like to share because it\u2019s germane to everything we do because we hear about achieving, and performing, and being our best selves", "mind you, this is a bullfighter who rose from poverty to be the best bullfighter of all time and with no aptitude for the sport, really", "and, if you\u2019re bad at martial arts, or surfing \u2013 whatever \u2013 but, if you\u2019re bad at bullfighting, you die", "anyways, so he said the following, he said, \u201cno life worthy of the name consists of anything more than the continual series of struggles to develop one\u2019s character through the medium of whatever one has chosen as a career.\u201d which that\u2019s fascinating because, now, your career becomes reframed as merely something with which you\u2019re going to develop your character", "and so i think that\u2019s what my 80-year-old self would say, to just remind me of that \u2013 \u201ckeep working on your character", "it really doesn\u2019t matter what you do.\u201d what aspect of your character are you most trying to develop in your current primary\u2026", "fearlessness", "what was that", "fearlessness", "fearlessness", "yeah", "josh, that\u2019s a tough act to follow", "that was beautiful, man", "i have trouble remembering four-word quotes", "that was amazing", "i\u2019m like, \u201c\u2018to be or not to\u2026\u2019 how\u2026.?\u201d alright, josh, how about your 80-year-old self", "well, i\u2019m in the midst of this transition from being a fighter, a competitor, and then literally a fighter, to being a nurturer, primarily", "and my relationship with this sport that i\u2019m taking on now with paddle surfing, which is my fourth big mountain in terms of my own training, is much more about receptivity, and feeling the ocean, and entering that sweet spot of enormous power of something that\u2019s traveled thousands of miles", "and so a big reason that i\u2019ve gone that way is because i feel that the art of receptivity is just a never-ending pool i intuit from here", "and so receptivity and love is a huge part of what i intuit is where i\u2019ll be focused for the next 10, 20, 30 years and so i would say from here that, from my perspective now, that\u2019s what i think my 80-year-old self would be telling me to focus on is deep listening to humans, and nature, and what\u2019s moving most elementally inside of myself", "i\u2019m a completely devoted dad and i can\u2019t imagine my 80-year-old self saying anything but, \u201cseize every moment you can with these little dudes and give them every ounce of love you can.\u201d and i also feel in myself now a commitment to living life \u2013 every last drop as fully as i can ever live it", "and, honestly, i live in new york now and this is putting that into question because i\u2019m so passionate about the\u2026 i love new york", "i\u2019m a new yorker", "i love the city but i\u2019m yearning for nature right now", "i feel, in some ways, that living in the water is what\u2019s needed for this next surge of me living life as fully as possible in my own development", "and so i think that that\u2019s the direction my 80-year-old self would be giving me a kick in the ass but he\u2019ll be a lot wiser than i am so\u2026 there\u2019s so many questions i want to ask \u2013 we\u2019ll have to continue this \u2013 but let\u2019s start with one which is what is some of the worst advice that you hear given out in your world", "and you can choose world however you want to define it", "that could be past career, current career, it could be circle of friends, it could be anything like that", "or a terrible piece of advice \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be the worst \u2013 but a common piece of advice", "and i\u2019ll buy some time here", "for me, i remember applying to colleges and having my guidance counselor in high school tell me to lower all my standards because i wanted\u2026 i had my reach schools, my a list, i had my \u201ci think i can get into\u201d b list schools, and then my safety schools, and he said, \u201cno, no, no.\u201d he laughed", "he said, \u201coh, tim", "silly, silly boy", "you need to take your safety schools and make those your reach schools", "you\u2019re five paragraphs too high here.\u201d and, not realizing at the time \u2013 i realized this soon thereafter \u2013 that his incentive was to be able to say, \u201cx percentage of my students got into their first-choice college.\u201d the easiest way to do that is to make everyone lower their standards", "so that was a terrible piece of advice that i received and a terrible piece of advice that i hear a lot", "so the antithesis of that would be, \u201chold the standard,\u201d which is the advice, for instance, at the fat duck which was, at the time, the no", "1 ranked restaurant in the world", "heston blumenthal said that to someone i\u2019ve had on this podcast, chris young, is like, \u201chold the standard,\u201d because he tried to pass something off that was 99 percent perfect, but not 100 percent", "so anyone want to take a stab at that", "\u201cdo it the way that that guy did that.\u201d \u201cdo it the way that guy did it?\u201d yeah, people give advice all the time that you should follow this prescriptive path to success", "yup", "and i think that excellence is all about self-expression", "mm-hmm", "and so people look outside and try to replicate the path of somebody else but then, when the shit hits the fan as it always does \u2013 when the pressure\u2019s on \u2013 it\u2019s not coming from inside of you", "how much of self, let\u2019s just say \u2013 tim, josh, and so on \u2013 is discovery versus creation, in your mind", "in other words, do you \u2013 [crosstalk] that\u2019s a great question", "[crosstalk] \u2013 start with the raw materials of everything that josh represents and then it\u2019s a process of pulling back the layers of the onion and discovering these different pieces", "or is it really just tabula rasa\u2026", "[crosstalk] i think you\u2019re entangled", "yeah", "i think that, as we\u2019re discovering ourselves, we\u2019re creating ourselves", "i think about this in the context of someone taking on an art", "they have to understand who they are", "i think people should do what they love and they should do it in a way that they love but that evolves and so it\u2019s not stuck", "it\u2019s not static", "it\u2019s dynamic", "it\u2019s dynamic quality versus static quality and so there\u2019s the act of creation in the discovery process", "and i\u2019ve experienced that the biggest losses that i\u2019ve had and the biggest disappointments that i\u2019ve had have led to the biggest wins of my life", "in many ways, that\u2019s because i created myself based on the response to that experience", "and i think that\u2019s actually really an important part of this principle of unobstructed self-expression \u2013 doing it from what\u2019s inside out", "that\u2019s always changing and you have to be attuned to it", "so the way i would respond to that would be that, intuitively, they\u2019re fundamentally entangled and navigating that entanglement is a big part of the genius and the growth curve", "agree", "i do agree", "well, i agree that that is an interesting viewpoint to have on it", "it\u2019s something that i\u2019m\u2026 that sounds like a dick-ish way of saying, \u201ci didn\u2019t understand a thing that you just said,\u201d but it\u2019s not", "it\u2019s just that i don\u2019t have a firm position on it", "it\u2019s something that i\u2019m exploring for myself and thinking through myself", "so that\u2019s why i hang out with these guys is to get something to chew on", "so i have to chew on that", "i don\u2019t know if i agree with it", "i don\u2019t know either", "you just asked a question and i thought it up", "that\u2019s what i think", "ramit", "i heard the most interesting pieces of advice recently and it blew up something i\u2019d believed my whole life", "so my friend, nick ray, runs a company on museums and he takes people in museums and he gives them tours that are really cool", "and he was talking about how he goes to a museum himself and he said, \u201cif i go to a museum, i\u2019m spending 90 minutes, max, and the first 30 minutes are in the caf\u00e9 planning where i\u2019m going to go.\u201d and i\u2019m sitting there saying, \u201cwait, what?\u201d and i said, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d the way i was raised, we would go to a museum maybe once every five years \u2013 maybe \u2013 as kids", "we\u2019d save up our money to go there and we would spend seven hours going every level because we knew we were never going to go back", "and what nick was saying, in so many words, was have the abundance to know that you can go back and don\u2019t think that it\u2019s once and done", "and also know that leave at the peak \u2013 there\u2019s power in leaving at the peak.\u201d and it blew my mind to think that, my whole life, at that point at 34, that i had just thought, \u201ci\u2019ve got to go through every single thing and check the box.\u201d but, really, he\u2019s talking about curation \u2013 he\u2019s talking about abundance \u2013 all in a simple one-sentence example", "i love it", "it also reminds me of \u2013 we won\u2019t dig into it right now but we\u2019ve talked about it before \u2013 the ending on a good rep, ending on quality", "they\u2019re really closely related for both achievement, in that case, and skill development but also just for appreciation and quality of life", "adam, what about you", "which question are we talking about here", "yeah, what are your thoughts on the last ten minutes of conversation", "what\u2019s bad advice that you\u2019ve received, or heard, or that you want to give", "i remember i had sold my interest in the princeton review, and i was wondering what to do next with my life, and i was speaking at the time with two older, very successful, mega successful, businessmen \u2013 this was about 20 years ago \u2013 and one of them said i should go into ball bearings", "he thought for a second and he said, \u201cadam, ball bearings.\u201d that\u2019s great", "i love that", "right", "and he said, \u201cokay, stay with me here.\u201d he said, \u201call the smart talent from universities, they\u2019ve gone to wall street and they\u2019ve exhausted whatever there is to be found there", "you\u2019re crazy smart but you\u2019re competing with other people who are crazy smart and why do that?\u201d and, by the way, i thought he was\u2026 so he said there were no more possibilities there which that also was wrong", "but the second part was interesting: he said, \u201cball bearings.\u201d he said \u2013 [crosstalk] ball bearings", "right", "no, but you\u2019ll see the relevance in a second", "he said, \u201cball bearings have not had its edison", "right", "no one\u2019s gone into ball bearings so it\u2019s\u2026 no one\u2019s ever thought about ball bearings.\u201d [crosstalk] it\u2019s fertile ground", "they\u2019re little round things in different shapes \u2013 i mean, sorry, different sizes", "so he said it was a metaphor", "right", "the metaphor was, \u2018go with something that no one else has ever looked at.\u2019 and then you look at uber \u2013 who thought about taxis \u2013 you look at airbnb, you look at the most successful companies, and they\u2019re pursuing the ball bearings philosophy, right", "and so the first part, that opportunities on wall street had been exhausted, that part was wrong but the ball bearings part was right", "and i was talking to a friend who was
