This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show.\u00a0 [Foreign language] my beautiful, little [foreign language]. This show, as some of you may know, is about deconstructing world class performers, teasing out the habits, routines, life lessons, thought processes, frameworks, and so on from people in many different industries, many different areas of expertise that you can hopefully apply to your own lives. And my guest today is Steve Jurvetson, who really has his hand in many, many different worlds. You can say hello to him on Twitter @dfjsteve. He is a venture capitalist, but a lot more than that focused on founder led, mission driven companies at the cutting edge of disruptive technology. Now, you might think to yourself that\u2019s what I might hear many venture capitalists say. But he was recommended to me by a past guest as a guest, Matt Mullenweg who, I trust very implicitly. If you don\u2019t know D Wave, you will very shortly. He has been the founding venture capital investor in four public companies and many rapidly growing companies like Planet, Memphis Meats, Mythic, and Nervana, N-E-R-V, Nervana. He also led investments in startups that were later collectively acquired for $12 billion, probably much more, at this point. Before co-founding the firm DFJ, Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson, Steve was an RND engineer at Hewlett Packard, worked in product marketing at Apple. And next, many, many stories about his mentors there. And then, spent a short stint in management consulting at Bain. He completed his electrical engineering degree at Stanford in 2.5 years, think about that for a second, graduating No. 1 in his class and went on to earn all sorts of degrees, MSEE, MBA, etc. In 2016, President Barack Obama appointed Steve as a presidential ambassador for global entrepreneurship. Steve was also chosen as one of \u201ctechs best venture investors\u201d by Forbes and as the venture capitalist of the year by Deloitte. Steve will be launching a brand new venture fund sometime later this year. And you can read about it at future.ventures. So, not future.com, but future.ventures. That\u2019s how you would spell it out. Not surprisingly, he will be focusing on passionate founders who are on a mission to make the world a better place with penchant for unique ideas and disruptive technologies. And disruptive may be an overused term, but Steve really understands what that means. And we dig into some very, very, very specific examples that might make your mind explode. So, without further ado, please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Steve Jurvetson. Steve, welcome to the show. Steve Jurvetson: Thank you. Happy to be here. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I am looking here at all my notes, and you were kind enough to send links to various resources, interviews, discussions. And I have to tell you, I feel a little overwhelmed because, usually, if I have someone on the show, it\u2019s like okay, we have Person A, they\u2019re really good at rock climbing. I think we\u2019ll start with rock climbing. And in this case, we are not even going to cover 10 percent of the notes that I have in front of me, and they\u2019ve already been winnowed down. But there is, I think, one story that I came upon that I\u2019d love for you to describe for people just as a starting point. And it\u2019s a quote, and then, you can give the background from Professor David Deutsch out of Oxford. And it begins with, and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the only way this computer could be as powerful as it is \u2026 What is this quote? Steve Jurvetson: Sure. And I may be paraphrasing because stuff you wrote back in 2002, 2001, at least I read the book of Fabric of Reality in 2002, and he\u2019s talking about the power of quantum mechanics and the potential for quantum computers. And in so doing, he and Richard Feynman both realized that a quantum computer would be fundamentally unlike anything we have in this world today. And the way that quote roughly ends is that the only way to explain the power of these computers is to invoke the notion that it is sort of engaging the resources across parallel universes. That if you just use the resources of one universe, there\u2019s so much you can do. But in this case, you actually are, in the most poetic sense, harnessing almost refractive echoes across parallel universes to do computation in a fundamentally different way. And that usually bends the mind of most scientists and even physicists to the point of breaking or looking the other way. And the common response to this is I don\u2019t understand one bit of that. And it had me captivated. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, I want to jump into a number of areas that I know nothing about or very little about, even though I might use the words occasionally, as people who spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley are wont to do. But for people who don\u2019t have the background, I want to highlight a few things about you or, actually, one just as we\u2019re delving into some of the science. Steve Jurvetson: Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, your background or a lot of your background is engineering. So, electrical engineering? Steve Jurvetson: That\u2019s right. I did a bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, started a PhD. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And you were able to do so much of that partially because you finished your undergrad in 2.5 years? Steve Jurvetson: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. The point I wanted to make with that, and we\u2019re going to come back to that because I don\u2019t know how that even happens, is that you have technical literacy. Steve Jurvetson: Some. I\u2019m also learning like a child. Tim Ferriss: So, could you walk us through one of the terms I was hoping to understand for myself, and that is quantum computing? What is a quantum computer? Steve Jurvetson: Right. A quantum computer is a device. It\u2019s usually something that is either cooled down to almost absolute zero or has some other phenomenon that it takes advantage of that is at the edge of what is the known universe. Meaning, when you cool something to zero, behavior of materials changes dramatically. If you have a super conductor, the way it works is dramatically different from normal conductors. And so, what people have found is that rather than look at quantum mechanics as something that is spooky and bizarre, the way Albert Einstein even described it, the spooky action at a distance, this ability to entangle things, to have their fates intermingled can be not just sued for things like really unbreakable cryptography and data transmission. It can also be used in a very bizarre way to build a computer. And this computer looks something like a row of let\u2019s say rings that either magnetically in one direction or the other. You think of it in a traditional computer, it\u2019s a one or a zero. But, actually, it could be everything in between simultaneously much like when you dive into how an atom actually works. There isn\u2019t an electron at any given point. It\u2019s a cloud, it\u2019s a probability function around the atom. Well, that cloud is something we\u2019re not used to in the real world. We\u2019re used to the statistical aggregation of many atoms, just like there\u2019s a table, it\u2019s hard. I can\u2019t put my hand through the table. It\u2019s not sometimes here and sometimes over there. But the farther down you look, the closer and closer to let\u2019s say the atomic scale, you notice the behavior of physics becomes quantum physics. And rather than being something spooky, you can actually harness this to compute in a very peculiar way. In a way that \u2013 in a very simple \u2013 well, we could say it\u2019s as if all of your memory bank, in a computer, was a one and a zero simultaneously. So, you instantly jump or tunnel to the answer you\u2019re looking for to a particular problem. So, rather than exhaustively searching millions or billions or trillions of possibilities to find let\u2019s say the key that unlocks the digital lock, you just jump to the answer. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s seemingly science fiction, but these computers do exist. Steve Jurvetson: Yes. And even within scientific communities, there is some back biting that says, wait, do they really exist? Is this one an example, or is that just a fast analog computer? So, it is at the edge of A) what people believe is possible, and I think actually, literally, at this period of history where these computers are starting to come out. I\u2019ve been on the board of directors of one for over 15 years now. So, it was a little early for thinking when this is ready for prime time. It\u2019s now at the point where, for example, Google says that their quantum computer that they bought from a company called D Wave outperforms their entire data center on certain computational tasks that are important to what they do. And in other tasks that are meant to really show how fast is it, they found 100 millionfold speed up over the best computer they could buy from anyone else. Tim Ferriss: How big is such a quantum computer? Steve Jurvetson: They\u2019re almost all about the same size, not because the computer is big but because the cooling apparatus and the shielding from magnetic flux is high. So, think about a refrigerator size, slightly bigger, like two refrigerators. The actual computer is just on a little silicon chip that is just as small as any other silicon chip. It\u2019s just cooled to literally 500 times colder than the most remote part of outer space. Like a few millikelvin above absolute zero, which is really cold. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, to put the speed or power in perspective, could you please describe a graph that I\u2019ve seen you present, which I believe might start with is it 2002? Steve Jurvetson: Right. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And it looks like it progresses up to the right almost at a 45 degree angle, not that the angle is that important. It depends on what\u2019s on the axes. But could you describe what these different points represent? Steve Jurvetson: It\u2019s something I have affectionately called Rose\u2019s Law, with a sort of homage to Moore\u2019s Law because Moore\u2019s Law is actually named by Carver Meade. It wasn\u2019t Gordon Moore himself who labeled his law Moore\u2019s Law, nor did Jordie Rose the founder of D Wave. But when I was first speaking with him in 2002, having just read David Deutsch\u2019s book, he had produced a single qbit. They\u2019re called qbits for quantum bits. So, I\u2019ll just use the acronym qbit. He had manufactured one of these and tested and characterized it and had sent to the manufacturing facility \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now, is the qbit the entire computer? Steve Jurvetson: Think of it as, by loose analogy, like a memory array. It would be like a 1 bit memory array. But that\u2019s a really powerful memory array. So, when you go from one to two, you\u2019re now able to explore all possibilities of two to the second power, so four memory states. If you have three qbits, you could simultaneously explore eight possible memory states, if you have four, sixteen and so forth. It\u2019s a doubling. So, as you add a single qbit, you\u2019ve roughly, with some hand waving, doubled the power of your computer, roughly speaking, on the order of a two to the end phenomenon. So, if you were to add one new qbit every year, which he just stated, so coming to where did this graph come from, he just stated in 2002, I think we\u2019re going to double the number of qbits in a functional quantum computer every year in perpetuity. And so, I had to ask is that just because Gordon Moore said something that sounds kind of similar? And we had a conversation. I don\u2019t remember being particularly persuaded other than it\u2019s a semi conductive process. It takes roughly a year to digest the prior generation. Yeah, why shouldn\u2019t we be able to do this? And sure enough, that\u2019s held until today. So, it\u2019s been 16 years of doublings. The way the graph gets interesting though is, as with Moore\u2019s Law, it comes out of nowhere. So, Moore\u2019s Law you could actually trace back hundreds of years, arguably, that our capacity to compute as a species has been doubling roughly every year since we started to compute, since we had any kind of abacus. It\u2019s kind of weird how this has been growing. And the semiconductor industry is just the modern version of that. On a quantum computer, that doubling starts to reach thresholds where you could do things that you could do with any computer on earth. So, on this graph, if you look forward, and here\u2019s where there\u2019s been a little bit of a time delay, by the way, just full disclosure, where the power of some of these computers, there\u2019s been a bit of overhead. There\u2019s been a bit of set up and read out times. There\u2019s been a bit of noise and other things that have made the power of it not \u2013 it still scales like the original curve. Like that 45 degree angle you were painting in people\u2019s minds. But the power that the represents is \u2013 imagine you have to go two or four times bigger to hit some of these thresholds. But unless something falls off the rails, we will soon, in the next couple of years, have computers that can out perform any computer on earth. Then, you give it another couple of years. And it would out perform all computers that could ever be built on earth, even if you use the entire matter of the earth to build them. And then, this is where David Deutsch started to run this thought process out, give it another couple of years. You would outperform all computers that could possibly be built, if you use the entire matter of the universe at your disposal to build, in the best possible computer any human could ever design, and you gave it the length of the universe in time to work on a problem, it still couldn\u2019t solve these problems, and the quantum computer could in due course, in less than an hour. That\u2019s when, if your head hasn\u2019t already drilled out of your ears, it just really explodes like pulp. There are places where nature gives you a peek into its wonders. And as a scientist or engineer, we get these, in almost any field of exploration, whether it\u2019s inner space of quantum physics or outer space in the frontiers of the unknown. And here\u2019s one of those examples that just opens your eyes to how little we know in that you\u2019ll sometimes see this, and maybe in an experiment. I\u2019ll give you an example of one that David Deutsch also likes that some people might remember from their high school physics. If you have two slits, two very narrow slits, and you shine light through them, you get this diffraction pattern on the screen, on the following side of the table. And that\u2019s always been something we learned at the bulk statistical physics of a lot of photons, a lot of light going and interfering with each other because of the interference patterns. Well, what\u2019s fascinating is if you show single photons at a time, they will shoot through. And if you just tally up the statistics, they\u2019ll end up creating a distribution pattern just as if it were many photons interacting. So, the whole explanation of the wave theory of light is that waves interact with each other. And that\u2019s what creates this pattern, this ripple pattern on the other side. But there\u2019s no interaction when you\u2019re a single photon at a time. It\u2019s not interacting with anything, other than its sister photon in a parallel universe. And David Deutsch is like that\u2019s obviously the explanation that makes all of this work other than it bends people\u2019s minds. And so, the two schools of thought are that\u2019s the answer or I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Tim Ferriss: What is David\u2019s background? Is he \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: He\u2019s a physicist. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Just to make sure. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah, he knows a lot of what he\u2019s talking about, way more than me. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. He\u2019s not a charlatan. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do you even make sense of that, in terms of considering the implications? Because we\u2019re not talking about thousands of years away, potentially. This is in the relatively near term future. What are the implications of that? Steve Jurvetson: So, the key to answering that question is what are these computers good for? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right. Steve Jurvetson: And either good news or bad news, depending on your point of view, is they\u2019re very hard to program at least historically speaking. Years would go by between major advances in the software, if you will, the algorithms that one can run on a quantum computer and do anything useful. There was something called Shore\u2019s Algorithm that came out a few years back that said you can actually factor integers, meaning break the number 15 into its prime factors of 3 times 5 is 15. So, if I give you 15, tell me what the prime factors are. If the number is small, we can kind of work our way randomly through it through either exhaustive search or some [inaudible]. But we don\u2019t really have a mathematical way to get the answer. And a quantum computer now can just give you the answer, which it turns out would break most of cryptography. Any of these mathematical symmetries are at the core of public crypto. So, that\u2019s kind of worrisome. What it\u2019s useful for beyond something that spooks should be interested in is we literally are also in the renaissance of software discovery. So, things that really seem to be coming to the top of near term opportunities or quantum chemistry and deep learning or machine learning, both of which are very interesting. The quantum chemistry is quite simply predicting accurately what a small molecule will do. It turns out, if you use a normal computer, and you try to solve [inaudible] equations and do what\u2019s called the bottoms up [inaudible] model like what does a water molecule do, what does aspirin do, how does it behave, you can\u2019t actually model this. It just computationally grinds to a halt. Quantum computer could do this almost on a one to one mapping. So, a quantum computer of about the same complexity as H2O and all of its electrons is about the size of computer you\u2019d need to model it perfectly. Like when does it freeze? What [inaudible] transitions. All of these weird properties of water that we take for granted that really don\u2019t come from the physics. We learn this in chemistry, but you don\u2019t learn it in physics because the math. It\u2019s computationally too complex. More interesting to me, personally \u2013 by the way, I first invested in quantum computing for quantum chemistry. That was the reason I got excited about this is we would be able to design drugs more quickly. I\u2019ll give you an example. Let\u2019s say you have some new H1N1 virus, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how can I design a molecule that would dock to this virus at a particular place.\u00a0 Like if I could only attack there chemically, I could kill it. Well, that\u2019s very hard to do, very easy to state, very hard to solve. So, you can test a drug, but you can\u2019t ab initio just design it out of scratch. And that\u2019s what these hopefully will be able to do soon. They rapidly accelerate drug design. The other are that has enormously wide applicability is in deep learning. And we can talk more about that field later. But, generally speaking, building little brains that can learn something very quickly. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s pattern recognition or image recognition for any number of applications and do that much better. So, that\u2019s why, perhaps, it\u2019s not surprising, Google has been the primary customer of quantum computers for the last 10 years is they use deep learning everywhere. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, we\u2019re going to, I\u2019m sure, get to deep learning. I shouldn\u2019t be so confident. I have 75 pages of notes. I will do my best to come back to deep learning, folks. I\u2019m not yet a deep learner, clearly, with all of the notes that I have. Steve Jurvetson: Or neural networks. That\u2019s the same thing, basically. If you want to come back to that, we can. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Great. So, I\u2019ll put those on my mysterious pad here. But a question that is tangentially related, but since you mentioned entanglement, this is something that\u2019s become very interesting to me as a non-physicist, of course, my ability to dig into it is limited. But I heard I believe it was Radio Lab, I could be making that up, but an episode of Radio Lab where they talked about some of the experimental design and results of using lasers to impact entangled I\u2019d suppose it would be atoms, does that sound right, or I\u2019m not sure, maybe sub atomic particles Steve Jurvetson: In some cases, they can create what\u2019s called the Bose Einstein condensate with lasers, in a sense trapping light and making it stop or doing really bizarre things. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, they were looking at entanglement across not just distances within a room but \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: I think they sent it in a loop at [inaudible]\u00a0or in Europe. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, 60, 70, 80 miles. And so, I started wondering to myself, again, as a professional amateur that\u2019s not terribly good at any one thing. It\u2019s like wait a second. If you were to ask David Deutsch, he might just laugh this off as a ridiculous question. But if the big bang happened, as many people imagine it to have happened or think of it to have happened, is it possible that everything that we can see, hear, feel, touch is entangled? Is there the possibility that everything is entangled? Anyway, that\u2019s a question that I think about, but I\u2019ve never asked a physicist. Steve Jurvetson: I\u2019m not sure. My gut is not in the powerful way that the quantum computer takes advantage of it. But there is the possibility of \u2013 first off, for those who don\u2019t know the experiment that you\u2019re referring to, they sent two entangled photons down sort of opposing fiber optic rings. And then, when they were far apart from each other, miles apart from each other, they would observe one and notice that the other resolved its state instantaneously at the same time. So, in other words, this notion of quantum indeterminacy that you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a one or a zero or somewhere in between until you look at it. But the moment you look at it, it changes the state. It\u2019s this really both strange and provocative notion of the quantum physics. And literally, we look at one of them over, let\u2019s say, on the left field, miles away, it will instantaneously resolve the other one as well, as if they were a single unit. And, in fact, you can\u2019t imagine information passing between them because it\u2019s faster than the speed of light that this is at the exact same moment that these things resolve. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to get out of my depth on so many of these subjects. Steve Jurvetson: I think the main takeaway that fascinated me and maybe hopefully every listener is we are just beginning to scratch the surface of understanding what these phenomena are about and taking advantage of them in any useful way. So, usually, quantum physicists, literally, since the beginning of the field have been more theoretical than experimental, more theoretical than useful. And I think the potential crashing of this onto business shores is potentially upon us where, again, when we talk about, let\u2019s say, the power of deep learning, if you could build an artificial intelligence, broadly defined, of any kind, a simple one that plays games or a simple one that recognizes cancer in pathology slides or recognizes anything in an x-ray in medical imaging sense, if you can do that better than anyone else on earth, that\u2019s a business opportunity. And that capability might start to lend itself to those who have the cutting edge of computation. And in the past, anyone could buy a computer and catch up with someone who has another computer. It was a commodity. I\u2019ll just go buy some more computers myself. But what if the practitioners of this sort of field are so esoteric and limited that there\u2019s only a handful of companies that know how to do powerful computing? That\u2019s kind of a worrisome future, potentially. Tim Ferriss: So, not to dedicate too much time to worrisome futures, but what do you see as the most likely existential or greatest existential risks to humans, animals, people, things on this plant? Steve Jurvetson: I think it would be very for humans, animals, and things. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Let\u2019s talk about humans. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Because I think there are all kinds of things we can do to hurt ourselves that nature won\u2019t have any problem with. It will march right along. The cockroaches will still be out there for many years. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Since my cockroach audience is still very small, we\u2019ll go with humans. Steve Jurvetson: They\u2019re incredible creatures. They\u2019re going to last through a lot. So, I worry about the way in which cultural evolution is, while it\u2019s progressing, it\u2019s not progressing fast enough. And we, as a society, are going through more rapid and gut wrenching change of various sorts that we may or may not be prepared to handle. So, for example, we may be in the midst, I would argue, of an ever accelerating rich/poor gap that politicians and policy makers just don\u2019t have their head around and could lead to a future of abundance, as Peter Diamandis writes about where everything is great because physical things are so inexpensive that even the poorest of the poor could live like kings of just a few years prior. But I think the cultural, in a sense, set up for this is not necessarily right, which is we don\u2019t have a lot of people thinking about it. Whether it\u2019s how we\u2019ll, let\u2019s say 10 years from now, 20 years from now, will we provide for basic human needs globally? Is it going to be normal capitalism in a democracy? Is that going to work just fine for everyone? Or will there be some that are horribly left behind? And I think social unrest is something that worries me more and more, I guess, in a succinct way. There are other things. I\u2019ve been involved with a nonprofit looking for asteroid defense. That\u2019s an existential threat of another kind that\u2019s easily addressed. For less than $400 million, you could take that one off the table. So, hopefully, that will happen. Pandemic flu or bioterrorism \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Just to pause for a second. So, take it off the table by building or destroying the \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: No, the key is just detecting them long before they hit earth. So, unlike the movies Armageddon or Deep Impact, you don\u2019t want to wait until final approach to try to do anything about it because breaking it apart turns a bullet into a shotgun shell. It\u2019s way too late. What you want to do, and this is what\u2019s so interesting is, for the first time ever, we can put satellites up that have these infrared sensors that can detect these objects at great distances and track them. And we have enough computational power, from three observation points, model out the end body problem of what will the next 100 years of this object\u2019s orbit look like, and will it hit earth at any point, in the next 100 years? So, that is a computationally complex thing we can do today. So, putting up one of those satellites in a near Venus orbit looking out to capture all of the threats to earth we could do today with less budget than some museums have. And the key then is, when you see something that will hit earth let\u2019s say 50 years from now or 30 years from now, you just bump it. All you have to do is give it the slightest little [inaudible] today, and all of its orbits around the sun, by the time it eventually intersects with earth, it\u2019s in a totally different place. And we can computationally know, yeah, just rear end it by a tiny bit, or hit it head on by a tiny bit, and then, you\u2019re done. Problem solved. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Wow. Steve Jurvetson: But you need time on your side. It takes years for that tiny nudge to accumulate enough distance delta that you miss something as big as earth. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, I interrupted, I think, your segue to bioterrorism. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Bioterrorism worried me a lot post 9/11 because I realized, looking into it, and from investments I had made, that it\u2019s increasingly becoming the case that a small number of people, in fact, an individual with let\u2019s say a college education in this field could build weapons of mass destruction. It used to take armies. It used to take despots and fascists leaders of countries and resources of countries to wield a weapon of mass destruction, to build one. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Using CRISPR gene editing, things like that. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. So, synthesizing small pox, weaponizing it, doing something like injecting and looking for a gene, which makes it incredibly deadly and mouse pox. Pox viruses affect all organisms that get to a certain concentration level on the planet. So, ants, deer, anything that live in dense areas, chicken pox develop a unique pox virus, so that it\u2019s kind of nature\u2019s way of telling you there\u2019s way too many of you people on this planet. You need to thin the herd. They can be bioengineered like crazy. And this worried me because, when I spoke to people in various government agencies who spend their time modeling and doing red team simulations of bioterrorism outbreaks, their only answer, at the time, was well, we hope they wouldn\u2019t do this. Like just kind of like a leap of faith that this is such a horrible thing to wield that people would stop short. And, at the time, that gave me no comfort. And as time passes, I actually think there is an element of truth to that. It\u2019s not the kind of thing the typical terrorist cell can get someone fired up about. There is a weird thing, even within the worst, what everyone put in quote marks, \u201cworst\u201d parts of societal trouble makers, if you will, on the planet where this isn\u2019t a place they tend to go. Flying a plane in a building is a more natural vector of getting attention for your mission and getting someone to volunteer for the duty than saying I\u2019m going to go kill a bunch of innocent people with a contagious agent. It\u2019s a kind of weird cross product of threats. Tim Ferriss: How did you convince yourself of that? Steve Jurvetson: Oh, I haven\u2019t. I worry about it, too. Yeah. It\u2019s on my top three list of worries. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What are the others? Steve Jurvetson: So, inequality/unrest, bioterrorism, what is my other one?\u00a0 Oh, climate change, of course. Oh, my God, climate change. So, the thing about climate change that worries me is the things I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ll give one example. Last week, I learned of a new thing that I really didn\u2019t learn to worry about until last week, which is, of all places, out of NASA Aims, the former director was telling me they had been doing these interesting studies trying to figure out how can we induce hibernation in mammals, which, for interstellar travel, would be great. In the movies, the humans somehow all go into hibernation mode in all of the movies we see. And they were doing studies with rats. And they could actually get rats to hibernate for two days, at a time, by exposing them to hydrogen sulfite. And that immediately led me to ask why is that adaptive? Why would we have this sort of latent pathway that really doesn\u2019t seem useful for anything that puts rats to sleep for two days at a time, and they would die, if it was longer than that. And it turned out, back at one of the major extinction events, and I\u2019ll try to be more concise here than I might otherwise be, there was a major volcanic outburst. It led to major climate change. And the polar ice caps melted. And the greenhouse effect. And the problems with the ice caps melting wasn\u2019t the sea levels rose. That just affects Bangladesh and Miami, but it doesn\u2019t take out humanity, if sea levels rise. The thing that could take out humanity is if the ocean currents stop going. And part of that was driven by fresh water melt off the poles. So, potentially, long before the poles are completely gone or perhaps completely unrelated to temperature change, if the ocean stopped circulating, you get this complete dead zone where organisms depend on the circulation of nutrients to survive. And, basically, purple and brown bacteria took over. And they are these hydrogen sulfite bacteria. You\u2019d have these waves usually coupled up to two days at a time of just, literally, lethal gases sweeping across the landscape that the survivors learned how to hibernate through. So, in a long winded way, the thing that both was most interesting, and maybe here\u2019s a hint of how we can induce hibernation in mammals like humans, but also reminder that we\u2019ve had climate change many times on this planet, and really bad things can happen that have nothing to do with carbon or methane or all of the things we\u2019re focused on. It could be the hydrogen sulfite gas that kills us, which is the rotten smell of eggs. It\u2019s nasty stuff. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0On the social unrest piece, just because I know there are many people out listening who will be wondering this, what do you see as the preventative steps, if any, that can be taken to mitigate that risk? Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. So, first, I was looking at like does it feel like it\u2019s self-correcting? Is it self rectifying? Is there something that\u2019s a natural governing feedback loop, a negative feedback loop that says the rich get richer. Is there something that naturally makes that not continue further? And, unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of \u201cpositive\u201d feedback loops, not in the normative sense but in the regulatory sense of it just is a runaway thing like runaway climate change. And that is you can get \u2013 first off, every business becomes an information business over time. What I mean by that is, if the basis of competition, why is Company A winning over Company B, is it the way they process information? Is it a software layer to their business? That I think is rippling through every part of industry, whether it\u2019s the aerospace industry, the automotive industry, agriculture. It\u2019s not oh, he worked harder. He was an artisan in his field, that\u2019s why he or she is a better farmer. It\u2019s oh, he\u2019s got better gene scripts from [inaudible]\u00a0or whoever. And the basis of competition in agriculture has moved to information tech. As every industry goes that way, those industries will start to look more like where you see Google and Facebook, a winner take all kind of dynamic where between firms, you have very few winners. And within firms, you have very few winners. So, every fractal scale, it\u2019s kind of like a winner take all. There\u2019s a few people within these firms that garner most of the wealth. And there are a few companies that garner most of the wealth in each industry. Now, that\u2019s perhaps \u2013 so, that trend is somewhat negative, and that technology takes over more and more, innervates more and more of the economy. It subsumes or eats the world, if you will. I think that would be a side effect. One other side effect that\u2019s negative is people sometimes reject modernity when they can\u2019t keep up. You sometimes subscribe to a different belief system, not science and math as the progress vector of humanity.\u00a0 It\u2019s like I\u2019m going to reject science. I\u2019m going to reject math. And there are entire countries that are taking this stance, which is scary because they\u2019ll fall farther and farther behind, perhaps, with an inability to catch up to modernity when and if they choose to. So, that worries me. The only current \u201cnegative\u201d feedback loop, the thing that prevents wealth from going completely crazy, is that, luckily, and I think maybe understandably, the wealthiest tech entrepreneurs tend not to live like rock stars or rap stars in LA. They tend to give back. And a simple explanation for me having seen many of these people before they made billions of dollars and after is that, if you\u2019ve made billions of dollars in let\u2019s say under five years, you don\u2019t tend to ascribe that to your incredible hard work and superior intelligence. It is a farce to hold onto the belief that I am better than others, that\u2019s why I\u2019m a billionaire. So, they give back in droves. Incredible acts of philanthropy. And so, right now, the philanthropy governor is the one thing I see that\u2019s at least a positive that says maybe this actually will allow people like Gates and others to take on multiyear quests like eradicate malaria or polio. Well, right now, polio and next malaria, in a way the governments can\u2019t even take on. You have projects that exceed the budget and the GDP of nations. You have projects that exceed the lifespan of any politician. And luckily, this is what these people are choosing to do rather than just show off. And so, I\u2019m really happy about that. And I\u2019m trying to live my life that way as well. So, the question of going forward is there are a lot of debates about basic income, universal basic income and experiments that are trying to get funded to see if it works the way people think it might. I think there could be all kinds of experiments in almost corporate health plans, at large. So, right now, most companies who have more than 1,000 employees will manage the health plan of their employees. So, it\u2019s cheaper than going to a third party. I will actually pay for your healthcare because paying some third party, they\u2019re just making money off of that. And I\u2019ve got enough critical mass with 1,000 employees that that makes sense. Well, imagine food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare are all equally cheap. Meaning everything costs $1.00 a pound in the world that\u2019s a physical thing. That\u2019s where we\u2019re heading in the end point. All physical things should be the same cost. Bag of potatoes, $1.00 a pound. Bag of chips, $1.00 a pound. A car \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why is that? Steve Jurvetson: Because and then, what you\u2019ll pay for is the software, the intellectual property, the thing that, in certain places, could lock up. Yeah, maybe that Ferrari costs more because it\u2019s the design, not the materials. But it\u2019s just manufacturing methods are all converging, whether you think of it as additive manufacturing or just traditional manufacturing that stuff is not the rare commodity. You pay for intellectual content like entertainment and software. That\u2019s what all future economies will be based on. And physical stuff is all about the same. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What are the means of manufacture? Steve Jurvetson: Well, we\u2019re going to grow things, I think, increasingly, in the future. I think we\u2019re going to grow with algae and other things, chemicals. So, I think about sheer metric tons of stuff. Liquid chemicals is a big part of it. And we get almost all of that, 90 plus percent from oil today and the petrol chemical economy. It\u2019s all going to shift to renewables. And so, that sort of manufacturing stuff like the stuff that goes into plastics, which is more and more of the physical world that we\u2019re in. Obviously, metals will still come from, unfortunately, metal sources. But I think it will shift to carbon and other kinds of materials increasingly for structural stuff. This is, potentially, in the nano tech/carbon economy of the future that building things out of carbon nano tube like structures and meshes is just much lighter materials, effective, and just efficient way of doing things. So, we could look to nature. How does a spider\u2019s silk thread outperform almost any other modern material? And there are startups that are building synthetic silk now with these little nano machines that reproduce what the spinnerets does on a spider. So, across \u2013 but coming back to just this inequality point and the corporate path potentially there, or it could be a Peace Corps equivalent that says, if you work for X number of years, you get healthcare, in theory, for a longer period of time. And why couldn\u2019t that start to subsume, the way some companies already provide lunch for free, why couldn\u2019t, in a sense, basic food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare be provided for free? And the healthcare part, by the way, right now, is a huge part of the economy, but it shouldn\u2019t be. I think we\u2019re also, and this is something I want to invest in, we\u2019re going to find a way to make the information search of health free, so we don\u2019t have to pay for the diagnosis. And I can\u2019t imagine a future where knowing what I need to do to make myself healthy would be something I\u2019d pay for. The actual doing, if it involved surgery, maybe. The pills, they should all be $1.00 a pound, the physical thing. And that future, I think, will be incredibly enabling for changing a society to a stable one where you don\u2019t fear for the health of your children or their ability to live. Then, you could have almost like a renaissance where you pursue the things that are meaningful to you, whether it\u2019s poetry or science or what have you, meaningful work online. People do this all of the time. We spend a ridiculous amount of our time on things that aren\u2019t paid but are meaningful to us. And that, I think, increasingly is what the world will look like in the future. Meaningful work and contributions, not a job, in the traditional sense. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If the pills are $1.00 a pound, how do you maintain the ability to develop and innovate those drugs? Is it just because the computational power becomes so inexpensive that you have then competitors to the current incumbents who are, of course, highly incentivized to protect their \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. It\u2019s the long run because you could imagine any current phase or even long term, whether you call it transition phase or this is how the new ones come on the market, you have to reward, of course, that effort to the extent that effort is still as expensive as it is today. You need to recoup it. And that would be an intellectual property question. It\u2019s almost, again, like the software of it. The generic manufacturers know how to make the drug. It\u2019s but for law around intellectual property that it costs more. So, the physical manufacturing is still going to be a $1.00 a pound. Now, the question is is it priced as such? And so, in my model of this, you\u2019d start with the generics and have this massive distribution channel. If you want to reach a billion people, you could sign onto this platform for the poorest of the poor and reach a billion people at some sort of reasonable cost position for a generic. But I think the cost of discovery will also come down back to the computational and quantum chemistry side, so that it doesn\u2019t need to take so long and be so expensive. And right now, you have an FDA regulatory system that\u2019s a bit archaic, in that regard, where they aren\u2019t quite set up yet. And they\u2019re trying to transition, but they\u2019re slow at this, into a world where you have personalized medicine and a world where my medicine is different than yours. And, therefore, the clinical trial concept really changes. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, we\u2019ve been talking mostly current or I\u2019ll say present and future tense. I want to go back to that 2.5 years undergrad. How does such a thing happen? How is that possible? Steve Jurvetson: It\u2019s interesting. I took it as a challenge. When I started at college, I was going to Stanford, and I realized it was expensive. And my folks are immigrants from Estonia. And I kind of found it difficult. And we were middle class people, at the time, so I didn\u2019t get financial aid. And I was looking at this. And I was like this costs a lot. I just felt guilt. So, I looked at the various rules for graduation, and it felt like a simple system of equations. Like this plus that has to equal this. Like I actually boil it down to, oh, I see, they\u2019re just trying to get four years of tuition out of you. So, where can I explore the corner cases? And so, I came in with the maximum number of AP credits. So, it actually goes back to my high school, St. Marks in Dallas, that incredibly well prepared me for college. So, I took the maximum number of AP units that I could. But, of course, universities limit, not surprisingly, how much of that applies. I also took a couple of summer classes that I could transfer in from another school. They have a certain number you could do. I maxed that out one summer, while I was doing summer jobs at HPS. I took night classes. But, most of all, I learned a trick from the grad students. This is the key answer, actually. By the time you get to be a grad student, you realize that you\u2019re limited to something like nine units a quarter. And that\u2019s kind of limiting, if you take five unit classes, shoot, you can take a class and a half. So, what they realized is you can sign up for a class for less units than it\u2019s listed, just not more. So, the check sum on the computer algorithm was not did you say it was a five unit class or say it\u2019s six, and it\u2019s only five. It\u2019s is it that or less. So, you can just say it\u2019s even a zero unit class or one. You just make it whatever you want. So, you\u2019re not taking more than 20 units a quarter, so you meet that algorithm, yet, you\u2019ve got all of the pre-requisite classes you needed for the next one. You have to map this out early on. You have to start freshman year to make this work. Oh, and I had to get a physics teacher to let me take a class and a double E teacher sort of against the pre-requisites saying like I really can do this. Let me try to take your class a year earlier than I should, so that I can get the pre-req chain going. All of these simultaneous equations you have to solve. But the signing up for more classes was the key. There was like one winter quarter where I took the equivalent of eight classes where you would normally take a load of four that made that possible. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, when did, if it did, when did the budgeting stop being a concern? Because you then went on to continue your schooling. Steve Jurvetson: Right. It all flipped completely like total mode shift, when I started my master\u2019s program, and I became a research assistant because that paid for school Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, this is at HP? Steve Jurvetson: Well, it was working summer at HP, but I started a master in electrical engineering. So, it\u2019s still at Stanford. I was a research assistant for Professor Hennessey who went on to do amazing things there and was an entrepreneur himself, at one point. And I shifted gears. I didn\u2019t want to leave school. Going through 2.5 years, the problem is wow, I kind of missed out on a lot of social life and living. And so, I, basically, at that point, stretched it out and tried to stay as long as I could. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Got a balloon payment of recreation. Steve Jurvetson: It\u2019s kind of funny how it suddenly changes. Now, I want to stay. I don\u2019t want to leave. And I found a way to be in the freshman dorms as a grad student, which was awesome. I was the computer coordinator there, which meant that I kept the computers running and kept the paper in the printers. But it meant I could have freshman dorm life all over again as a grad student. And it was fun. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, if we look then at your master\u2019s, and I suppose it would have been \u2013 maybe it was simultaneous or after, you could tell us, the MBA \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Oh, that came later. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That came later. So, the MBA, why did you decide to get an MBA? And would you do it again, why or why not? Steve Jurvetson: A lot of folks who I knew and know are asking that same question. And I think it\u2019s a challenge that a lot of higher ed is facing, which is is this a vocational thing, is this \u2013 and one unusual thing about business school, it\u2019s the only educational program I know of where everyone comes in with prior work experience. Even law school and med school and what have you, you just go straight in from undergrad. And so, it\u2019s got a very different kind of feel to it that way. And people might ask, especially when there\u2019s something like a dot com boom going on in the \u201890s, do I want to step out for a couple of years from the economy and miss maybe that window, that opportunity that might be so ripe? So, the main reason I went is networking really to expand the \u2013 and to learn, frankly. But the networking came first in mind. To meet a bunch of people who come from all kinds of different backgrounds that I could learn from, not only at school but throughout my life. And one of the sub points on that is, for example, pretty basic questions like what do I want to do in my life. I had bounced around from engineering to management consulting, prior to business school and thought well, from what I know today, maybe I want to go to product marketing. I thought that\u2019s what I wanted to do. But I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anyone who has done that. And well, if I go to business school, no matter where I look, there\u2019s going to be plenty of students who have done that in the past, and they\u2019re looking to do something new. And so, you have all of the consultants trying to leave consulting. And you have all of the I bankers trying to leave I banking and learn about something new. What better place? Tim Ferriss: Especially when your employer hoping to leave is paying for it. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. So, that\u2019s exactly right. In fact, that was exactly what happened to me. I was financed by my former employer. So, I had that sort of safety net. And then, I decided not to go back, I had to pay for all of my tuition in one check. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I was wondering how that worked out. Steve Jurvetson: That was a tough decision. Tim Ferriss: They don\u2019t let that one go. Steve Jurvetson: No, they don\u2019t let it go. It\u2019s a loan. And rightly so. I didn\u2019t expect to get a free ride and not go back. But it did raise a barrier to leaving. The other thing is learning. Business was not what I went to learn per se. I knew there would be some classes about business that I thought would be helpful. But I\u2019d done so much at Bain that I kind of had a small business degree already. And I had taken classes back when I was an undergrad and a grad student prior in accounting and finance. So, I had already taken a lot of, again, the core courses. I placed out of every core course at business school, too, and went right into the electives and the more interesting classes. But I also knew that it was an opportunity to take classes in other departments, to brush up on actually molecular simulation of all things. And one of the classes I took was on modeling quantum mechanical properties of materials. You normally don\u2019t take a class like that. And that really all played out. So, did it to what I expected? In a way, it did. I didn\u2019t know venture capital existed. When I grew up in Texas, I had heard the term. I never met a venture capitalist. Never knew anything about them, wouldn\u2019t know how to reach one, no idea. When I grew up, there wasn\u2019t there internet. So, I literally would not know how to reach one. They\u2019re not in the phone book. There\u2019s no way to find them. They really aren\u2019t putting up billboards or advertising in any way. So, the entire transition of the venture occurred because of people I met there. And I learned a lot. Tim Ferriss: I should point out good location for it, too. Steve Jurvetson: That\u2019s true, in the middle of Silicon Valley, that\u2019s true, yeah. And that\u2019s the only school I applied to, by the way. If you think about do you want to go to business school, I did not apply to any other school because there was no other school that would have met that goal. Also, I learned a lot. And back to the network, almost every investment I made, I think it was almost for the first year or two out of business school, and there was a lot because it was the middle of the dot com boom for me, had some business school connection. It was, literally, the entrepreneurs were from business school, or it was sent to me by a professor from that business school. For the first year, that\u2019s how I jump started everything I did. Tim Ferriss: So, my madness/method is usually not chronological. So, we\u2019re going to zoom out a little bit. What mistakes do you see otherwise very smart venture capitalists making? Are there any patterns? Are there any particular types of mistakes? It could be investors, broadly speaking. Steve Jurvetson: Oh, my God, tons. All over the place. And to be fair, I\u2019ll try to drop in and mention, when I made those same mistakes, by no means am I trying to judge, as if I know better, but two that jump to mind, one is way too many seem to be loss avoidant or fearful. And I\u2019ll elaborate that in a moment. And then, but the other one that jumps to mind equally is they think they\u2019ve hit upon the formula for success. And yeah, that has \u2013 at many different levels at which that\u2019s worrisome. So, the first one, this notion of being fear driven. I\u2019ve come across so many investor who will say something like we have a strategy to try not to lose any company, as if that\u2019s like we\u2019re in the trenches. Every company will succeed. And if you\u2019ve just been at this game for a few decades, you\u2019ll realize that\u2019s just folly. The earlier you go, the higher your death rate is going to be as a startup. So, the majority will fail. Just give them time. And that sad reality took a while to sink in for some. But until it does, you\u2019re going to be very timid in your investing. So, most investors I see just let all of the biggest home runs pass them by. Almost every term sheet I\u2019ve written to a company that\u2019s turned out to be a spectacular home run, I had no competition, at the time of the series. Nobody else would invest in the company. Tim Ferriss: What were the reasons for not investing? Steve Jurvetson: It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s way too early. It\u2019s a science project. Tim Ferriss: No traction. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. There\u2019s no product. So, first off, almost everything I\u2019m doing, there\u2019s no product, no customer yet. It\u2019s an idea. It\u2019s in prototype stage of development, or there\u2019s not even a prototype yet. Or they just don\u2019t agree that the world is going to change in this way. So, and, in often cases, conventional wisdom would support their point of view. Like let\u2019s not invest in any automotive company because every investment since Henry Ford has failed like 100 percent of them. They\u2019re just road kill scattered on the highway. And by the way, many, many start ups funded well over $10 million. So, decades ago, that\u2019s a lot of money, in the automotive sector, all of which have failed. Many in batteries, many in solar, just scores. Maybe hundreds of companies have failed. So, when you\u2019ve, let\u2019s say, lost four times in a row, you just give up on the category. So, sometimes, it\u2019s the more experience grizzled investor that\u2019s like that whole sector, I\u2019m just going to steer clear of it because I have too many scar tissues there. But that\u2019s not really the thing I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about new entrance to the venture business, people who you would think would take a strategy of differentiating myself from my peers, having a basic strategy, let\u2019s say, to say why would an entrepreneur want to work with me versus all of the other firms. And if it\u2019s like well, I\u2019m investing in the hot sector. Pick whatever it is du jour. Consumer internet or social this or block chain that. It\u2019s like it\u2019s the hot thing. Yeah, but there are also 100 other people who have the exact same idea you just did. It\u2019s the hot thing. Why are you different? And there\u2019s no answer. So, this lack of strategic thinking and also lack of thinking of a long term strategy. Like okay, whatever you\u2019re doing today, is that going to work 10 years from now, whatever that strategy is? And I don\u2019t hear strategy from anyone. Like okay, here\u2019s how I\u2019m going to stand out over a sustained period of time. Here\u2019s how I will \u2013 and it can be simple things. I\u2019ll have a niche. I\u2019ll only do XYZ, and I\u2019ll be known for my niche or my specialty. Tim Ferriss: What worked for you, in the early days, when you were just getting started? Steve Jurvetson: First, it was a stroke of great luck, which is the dot com boom, as we now call it, was just starting to happen. And I was ready for that and open minded enough. So, I didn\u2019t have the scar tissue, which is, by the way, scar tissue for traditional investors was, if you invested in anything, it was like entertainment or media or shrink wrap software, as they called it, which is low priced software for consumers. That would be the consumer software segment. That was just a horrible place, games, history of business. It still is a horrible segment. It is to do non internet consumer price point stuff. It\u2019s a death zone. So, they thought the internet was that. They didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s an entirely different business model. What we now know around cloud computing, around subscription services, around viral marketing, it\u2019s potential, none of this was known, at the beginning. And if you put it into a prior bucket, it would be those are bad sectors. So, unbelievably, one of the biggest investment opportunities probably the venture industry has ever seen was largely avoided by most venture capital firms. And when I started in 1995, we did about a third of all internet investing industry wide. The entire venture industry. And that quickly changed in \u201996 and \u201997. And when Netscape had its IPO, boom, everything changed because, now, there was an example of a winner. This pattern will come again in space investing and everything. As soon as you have a single winner, then, the sheep phenomenon and the herd mentality kicks in. So, you have scores of people investing in a sector, after it\u2019s had its first win. So, to your question, being under the tutelage of Tim Draper to say actually, let\u2019s try to think big. I credit him for being my mentor into the industry to say not let\u2019s think about it the way bankers do. Let\u2019s not be fearful. Let\u2019s ask the entrepreneur how they\u2019re underestimating their market size. To think how much bigger might this opportunity be than even the people pitching it are imagining. And that\u2019s a thought experiment I often like to go through. And there will be times when, occasional, not often, where I\u2019ll be like, wow, you are so underselling your opportunities. Normally, an entrepreneur is trying to sell, to the maximum extent possible, to predict the largest possible addressable market to think well, Phase 1 of my business, I do this. And Phase 2, I take over the world in some way. And then, to actually try to push them further, and then, want to invest in them, is an interesting adjunct because then, you\u2019re on the same page. So, I credit Tim Draper. I credit the internet. And then, most importantly, is there was a simple rule I started implementing, and I don\u2019t remember when it started. It just seemed like the natural thing to do around early stage investing. So, when I thought about this, I was like, okay, most of the things fail. If they win, they\u2019ve got to be huge. Okay. I checked. They should change the world. They should be disruptive. Those are words people use. Well, how would I know if something really is big and disruptive? Well, every entrepreneur claims it. It could be doing a payment processing thing for back in whatever payroll system. It\u2019s like we\u2019re going to change the world of payroll. Okay. What really is going to make an enormous opportunity is it seemed to me that A) they\u2019re describing an enormous market. But B) here\u2019s the killer, no one else has done it before. And so, the simple rule I\u2019ve used throughout my entire career investing is I want to invest in things that are unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. And there are all kinds of [inaudible] that come out of that. The first is, yeah, you\u2019re investing in some unusual things like D Wave back in 2002. There were no other quantum computer startups, zero, on the planet earth. There was not a single company claiming to build quantum computers, big or small. Actually, for five years afterwards as well. So, that one is the most extreme. Maybe for good reasons, no one was doing it back then. When Hotmail first came, there was nothing like it that we\u2019d seen. When I first invested in Skype, there wasn\u2019t anything quite like that. The way that it did peer to peer voice over IP. And, similarly, with Tesla and electric vehicles. And I can get into why that one maybe is the most corner case of wait, there are a lot of electric car startups. Why is that one special? We can talk about it. But, certainly, Space X would qualify as well. And it\u2019s the unique ideas, at the time, in the start up domain. And but the benefit from my career was it has me perpetually, searching for the next great technology wave. So, just when the dot com boom was getting to its fevered pitch, I wasn\u2019t smart enough. I was not smart enough to predict a crash, and I know that I wasn\u2019t because I was contributing in writings and other things, at that time, saying oh, it\u2019s just the boom is just starting. It\u2019s going to go up, up, up, up, right. I believe that because I just wanted to that it\u2019s going to keep going and we wouldn\u2019t have a correction. But, on the other hand, I was not finding anything unique. I saw four business plans for selling pantyhose on the web. Like well, we\u2019re going to do [inaudible]. Like three others like really? Four business plans to sell pantyhose or just balls.com? I\u2019m like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What does just balls do? Steve Jurvetson: Just Balls, ventured backed, just sells balls. The name was awesome. We got justballs.com. What do you sell? Balls. You want a bat? No. You want a glove? No. We got balls. Balls of all kinds, small balls, big balls, golf balls, tennis balls. Tim Ferriss: Wait a second. Were you a founder? Steve Jurvetson: No. Tim Ferriss: Okay, just making sure. Steve Jurvetson: But this shows you how absurd it got to say take the economy and the internet changes everything. We\u2019re going to divide up the economy in weird ways it hasn\u2019t been divided up before and make that a business. So, that\u2019s when I knew this is crazy, and I started investing in nano technology\u00a0 Total left field shift. And there\u2019s a reason I picked that particular sector, but the important point is I didn\u2019t keep investing in the internet companies long past their prime, not because I was smart on when the correction would come, but it was because they weren\u2019t unique anymore. It\u2019s like every viral marketing idea, at the time, that I could find had come. Now, to my \u2013 so, I avoided a lot of pain. If you add up every internet \u2013 remember, we did so many of them? If you add up every internet company we invested in that lost money, add them all up, it was less than single deals lost from other firms. Like buy.com lost more money than everything we\u2019ve ever done combined because we didn\u2019t load up the boat, sort of drink our own Kool Aid too deep in any one of them. And every one of them was unique. So, there wasn\u2019t like this sector risk. So, you get diversification for free. By definition, you\u2019re diversified in your portfolio. And it has me, throughout my career, always on the look out to learn something new knowing that I\u2019m going to have to hop to a new sector. Not saying I\u2019m going to spend my whole life as a semiconductor investor or as a consumer software investor because that is so limiting. That might have a good 10 year run.\u00a0 But if you\u2019re not continually learning something new at the edges, pivoting from the edges of what you already know to something slightly different, you\u2019re going to become obsolete. Tim Ferriss: Why did you choose nano technology? Steve Jurvetson: That was a bit of a mistake. But it was a mistake in retrospect. But the only thing I felt I differentially knew better than others, it was harkening back to \u2013 which, fortunately, wasn\u2019t that many years prior that I had been studying some really hard technologies like molecular modeling and chip design. I did some chip design at Hewlett Packard. So, I had enough, as I looked at the venture landscape, differential knowledge there to say well, there\u2019s something I could harken back to that\u2019s not the internet because the internet, anyone could do, at this point. And the angel investors are flooding in. And every banker or consultant is flooding in. It\u2019s like the landscape is littered with capital and people investing in that sector. Well, there\u2019s nothing going on in nano tech. I had been exploring at the Forsythe Institute and a number of other sort of think tank like conferences that the radical potential this had to revolutionize a bunch of things. And the one part that I think was indicative of what\u2019s to come later in my career, it was not really , in any way, an industry.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t a sector. It doesn\u2019t describe a company. There\u2019s no such thing as a nano tech company, unless you\u2019re building tools to service tth industry in a weird way, manufacturing equipment maybe, but not in the attractive sectors. It more was a set of science and technology capabilities that would stretch across many industries. So, even today, there will be companies that we\u2019ll meet with and things that were unique from that era will play out like the value of simulation on any molecular system. Like how good is your simulation on any physical thing you\u2019re building, in general. These questions are process questions. Like how do you do innovation? How do you do entrepreneurship? That carries through. But that platform technology, which let me just tell you what I mean by this. Nano tech was like a platform applied in [inaudible] new ways of doing material science, if you will. Then, there\u2019s this whole field of synthetic biology. If you can manipulate DNA with CRISPR or other technologies, what are all of the things you can do with that capability? And it\u2019s very broad. It\u2019s not just health and food. And then, more recently, deep learning, neural networks, what we might describe as narrow AI. That whole field is widely applicable. I think every company will use it eventually. So, again, we can come to that later. But that\u2019s like a platform that\u2019s not \u2013 sure, today, there are some \u201cmachine learning\u201d companies. All they do is stuff related to machine learning. But much more interesting is all of the industries that will be changed by the use of machine learning, the vertical industries. And so, to put a cap on it, nano tech, if you look back at it today, no, there isn\u2019t any nano tech industry. It would be like saying it\u2019s the thermo dynamics industry. Well, shit, there isn\u2019t one, but there sort of is. Thermo dynamics as a concept, there was a time when, actually, companies named themselves Thermo Lectron and Thermetics. There are all of these ones that it\u2019s just now subsumed into the fabric of science and engineering. So, as a geek, I\u2019ve always been fascinated. Are there seed changes in, basically, how we do science and engineering? Maybe that\u2019s the simplest way of saying it. And I think, today, deep learning is the best example of that. It\u2019s a fundamentally different way of doing engineering. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Say that one more time, the last part. Steve Jurvetson: So, I think deep learning or let me just call it machine learning, broadly, because there are a bunch of sub branches of this. It\u2019s everything from generative design and sort of the auto desk, CAD [inaudible]. It\u2019s studying [inaudible] the way Steve Wolfram does. It\u2019s genetic program \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What are [Inaudible]? Steve Jurvetson: These are simple, little mathematical construct that just says, if you\u2019re going to draw \u2013 oh, my God. You\u2019re probably going to want to edit it out of the final thing because it may not relate to anything other than it created this book, a new kind of science, and really a series of epiphanies from Wolfram and others that the world is really interesting when you look at iterative algorithms applied millions and billions of times. So, [inaudible] is just imagine you started with a random dot or two. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Automata like automaton but with \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. And it sort of unveils. So, you have this little, simple, almost like a turning machine that says I\u2019m just going to go left to right and look at the dots above me. And if the dot above me \u2013 I\u2019ll look at the three dots above me. One directly above me, left, and to the right. And based on all possibilities of those three dots, which is two to the third power possibilities, I\u2019ll have either a dot or not a dot here. And so, you would think that such a simple rule that just says look at the three dots, and there are literally only sixteen possible conditions that I could be seeing up there. I\u2019ll have some other \u2013 I\u2019ll do something. And, in most cases, it\u2019s very boring. It\u2019s just like the whole thing is black, or it\u2019s got a nice pattern of triangles. But in a few case, like Rule 31, it unpacks into this incredible complexity that is not repeating. And there\u2019s no way to jump to let\u2019s say the 40th or the 50th or the 100th layer of this unfolding. You have to run the experiment. And the reason I find this so philosophically interesting is this is the same thing in evolution. It\u2019s the same thing in neural networks. It\u2019s the same thing in all of these new engineering modalities where you can\u2019t mathematically get a short cut to the answer. You actually have to just run this little algorithm over and over and over again. So, you can\u2019t, for example, reverse evolve. You can\u2019t figure out where did we come from in any direct way. It\u2019s sort of lost. You can run the tape forward, but you can\u2019t run it backwards. You can\u2019t do mathematical short cut across it. And so, an example of why this is a thought experiment is important is, whenever you\u2019re developing these neural networks, whenever you\u2019re training these little AIs, and I think this is the path to AI, in general, so it\u2019s important, this is how it works. You can\u2019t understand the thing you\u2019ve made, nor can you predict, as you train them further and further, what you\u2019re going to get. There\u2019s a bit of discovery, emergence, if you will. It\u2019s kind of like raising a teenager or parenting more than it is programming. You can learn about the process of creation like I know how to make a teenager, but I can\u2019t tell you exactly how it all works. And I certainly can\u2019t go in there after I\u2019m done and tweak a few neurons to make them smarter or French speaking or whatever. It\u2019s like that\u2019s a really weird artifact that works really powerfully. But it\u2019s not purposeful design. It doesn\u2019t do what I tell it to do exactly. It can learn to do what I train it to do, but with some edge cases. It\u2019s a little out of control. And that\u2019s what I think the AIs of the future will look like. So, I can come back to it if you want to talk about AI and deep learning. But I just \u2013 you asked about [inaudible], and the process learning \u2013 the question you started with was engineering, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Steve Jurvetson: So, the thing that I wanted to say is I think deep learning/machine intelligence is the biggest advance in how we can do engineering. So, specifically, engineering since the scientific method itself. So, way back when, engineering may have been random like I think astrology is true or I think this is true. And then, you have the scientific method. You release the method of compounding knowledge over time. This is a different way of, in a sense, growing solutions to problems instead of purposely designing them. You can build things that exceed human understanding. We\u2019re doing this all over the place in molecular engineering, in software design, in a variety of fields. We have sort of reached the limit, in many cases, of what a human, any human or even group of humans, can put their heads together and design. And now, we can push way past that and build things beyond our own understanding, which is pretty powerful. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Could you define \u2013 just revisit, you might have already done it indirectly, but the deep learning and neural networks? I guess I have sort of an approximate equal sign here. I\u2019m not sure if they are the same. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. They\u2019re synonymous. In the \u201880s, they were called neural networks and deep learning. There is a reason the word deep came in. Well, first, you want a new name. when something kind of came and went and is pass\u00e9 a couple of decades ago, because I studied neural networks back in the \u201880s, you have to give it a new moniker. But there is a reason. Deep in the sense of more layers. So, what do they have in common? And, in fact, neural networks, I think, could be a more generic term for all of this. It\u2019s inspired by the brain. It\u2019s a way of simulating a brain like subset. So, now the whole brain. But imagine you were to take a little, tiny chunk of your brain, a cortical column or some area and say what\u2019s really going on. Well, you have cells that connect to a bunch of others. And our brain is hugely a fan out of a thousand or so to ten thousand connections from each one. So, a huge fan out. Each cell connects to a bunch of others. And when one fires, it sort of goes down the dendrite, and the little synapse fires, and it triggers another one. We all have some vague sense of neurons are in our brain, and they\u2019re wired together, and they fire together. So, if you want to simulate one of those in a very simplistic way, in a way that you imagine the programmers back in the \u201880s, and they had pretty not very powerful computers. Well, how can you make a computer like brain? Well, we don\u2019t need all of that complexity. We don\u2019t need all of the details of ion channels and synapses and all of the neuro transmitter chemicals that are an artifact of our biology. What really is the essence of what\u2019s going on here? And the essence is something activates. It fires. It\u2019s connected in a network to some others. And if there\u2019s enough inputs that are firing beyond a threshold, then, downstream neuron will fire, too. So, the simple idea is, to recap, neurons fire. They\u2019re wired to other ones. You sum up all of your inputs. Everything is connected on the input, there\u2019s like thousands of inputs. And if it crosses some threshold, then, you fire. That\u2019s it. and then, you just layer on tons of these. And so, the deep learning is having more and more of these layers. Instead of one or two or three layers, having scores of these layers. And a variety of other algorithmic advances. But really, the biggest breakthrough has been that we have a lot of data today that we didn\u2019t have back in the \u201880s from the internet, from mechanical turk, you name it, all kinds of data sets to train on. If you wanted pictures of cats with the label that\u2019s a cat, that\u2019s a dog, that\u2019s obvious today. We take it for granted. Of course, you want a million of those, do you want a billion? How many pictures of cats do you want? In the \u201880s, good luck. You could spend your whole career trying to get a good data set to train digital networks with. Plus, we didn\u2019t have digital cameras. It\u2019s crazy, if you think of how little data we had in the \u201880s. Okay. So, data is the first. The other is GPUs from Nvidia. They started about 10 years ago as a side project in scientific computing realizing \u2013 Tim Ferriss: GPUs? Steve Jurvetson: Graphic processing units. So, any gamer would be like I want the latest to play my video games to do all of these polygon renderings offloaded from your main computing chip, the Intel chip, usually, off on the side what used to be a peripheral processor or co-processor, an afterthought, if you will, that only gamers cared about. If you were a business computing user, in the old days, in the \u201890s, you didn\u2019t care about your GPU. The only thing you cared about was your CPU, the thing that computes your Excel spreadsheet or whatever, your database. But the GPU people were pushing a whole different kind of computational math forward, which was a lot of math. A lot of polygons. The more polygons, the more sort of resolution you have in your game. And so, in a very interesting way, with a different objective function, not do a program that a human wrote faster and faster, but take the same damn simple math of, basically, it turned out to be what\u2019s called matrix multiply and add. Multiply a whole bunch of numbers together and add them up. Multiply, add them up. It\u2019s like that core mathematical operation, the more you could do, the better your graphics were. And so, they had an economic incentive to really push the envelope where, if you asked let\u2019s say, in the \u201880s or \u201890s, what else could that be used for, the answer was nothing. That\u00a0 just does graphics. It\u2019s like totally optimized for rendering graphics. But somewhere along the way, people realized, wait a second, there are other areas in the scientific computing world, and by this, I mean, let\u2019s say modeling the weather, modeling nuclear explosions occur in government labs where they\u2019re like we do a lot of that matrix multiplying and add, too. Can we try to see if we could use it? And so, it was like the skunk works project. Management had no resources against this. I knew, actually, one of the first four customers working in this RND area of all things to model how neurons fire scientifically. Tim Ferriss: To model? Steve Jurvetson: To model how a neuron actually \u2013 the actual biology of a neuron down to as much detail as possible. A company called Evolved Machines. And they were using GPUs. And I remember years ago saying you just bought, for $2,000.00, at the local Frye\u2019s Electronics Store, you just bought more power than any super computer of just two years ago for $2,000.00 because of this domain. So, this incredible computer resource was pushed to the limits from gaming. And I think almost poetically, when you think about rendering three dimensional worlds and making them photo realistic, you\u2019re doing something our brain does exquisitely well. We get an avalanche of information on our retina and our cortex. And we down scale that to image recognition building over there your face, the symmetry or your eyes. And much like a neural network, when you train them, it recapitulates our biology. It builds edge detector, and then, symmetry detectors, and then, eye/face things because you can probe what\u2019s been built a little bit and get a sense of oh, my God, it just recapitulated the sensory cortex in an artificial system. That\u2019s when the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Recapitulated meaning effectively \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Recreated from scratch. It\u2019s an analog because you\u2019re just training it like a baby. It gets born, opens its eyes, starts learning. That\u2019s the same general thing I have with these neural networks. The fact that it has similar layers in its visual system as our babies do, it\u2019s just that\u2019s when people like me are like oh, my God, this is incredible. So, back to the GPU thing, what I think is poetic is that something that, in a sense, is meant to be as realistic as possible to our vision system has the kind of computational systems we need to, in fact, do vision systems in let\u2019s recognize cats on the internet, or let\u2019s recognize cancer in a pathology slide. Those general constructs occur because our brain has evolved to do data reduction and pattern recognition in the world in a way that is optimal for what we do, so that when we build thee neural networks, what are they really good at? All of the same stuff. And so, all of the applications today are in speech processing, visual processing, which is the simple stuff, the edge of our cortex, and then, naturally, it\u2019s going to start moving into emotional systems and the frontal lobe and the rest of our cortical systems. And so, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s the obvious path to AI in the broadest sense. Tim Ferriss: So many questions. I love that story or that story/explanation for a number of reasons. One is how careful one should be with dismissing certain fields. Or even if they seem trivial or to be a waste of time, like gaming. If you look at the byproduct of the incentives that drove that, and then, the off label uses of GPUs, are GPUs, am I mistaken in thinking that they also have a role in cryptocurrency mining? Steve Jurvetson: Oh, absolutely. So, that\u2019s a very computationally intense task. And so, it moved definitely from into CPUs to GPUs, but then, it even went further. Then, it went to these field programmable gateways and then, to custom chips designed from scratch. Sort of it quickly went down that path. And deep learning chips will as well. That was one of my investment themes over the last three years is that deep learning is doing the exact same thing to custom chips. Tim Ferriss: So, you mentioned something much earlier \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Oh, one last thing on this. Nvidia summarized something amazing, and also Google did a paper. The majority of code at Google now is built by a computer not by a human because that\u2019s one weird way of summarizing this is when you train a neural network, you\u2019re not coding if, then, else. You\u2019re setting up the same thing you set up every time. It\u2019s a very [inaudible]\u00a0\u00a0skill set, by the way. And you train it, and the computer is generating its own executable, at the end of the day. The majority of programming is that way now by a factor of 10. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s so wild. Steve Jurvetson: And every product that Google embodies it from search to you name it, it\u2019s like that is the key technological thing stretching across every Google product. Tim Ferriss: So, you\u2019re so excited by the science, by the engineering. You mentioned product manager a while back. And you did, in fact, do that for a period of time, right? Steve Jurvetson: Summer jobs, yeah. Tim Ferriss: What I\u2019ve observed, not always, but very often, at least when I lived in Silicon Valley certainly, a lot of engineers have a severe distain, or at the very least a distaste, for all things \u2013 most things marketing related. Steve Jurvetson: Right. I remember that at HP, yeah. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s just a bunch of hand waving. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. On so many levels. Tim Ferriss: So, why did you, with the background you have, set your sights on product managing? Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. So, I remember exactly how this happened. I was at Hewlett Packard \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Wait, am I getting that right? Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Product marketing, product management, different \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Product marketing. That\u2019s actually the word I was looking for, sorry.\u00a0 Steve Jurvetson: And different firms use the terms differently. But I was open to both. In some cases, it\u2019s more engineering rich. In other cases, it\u2019s what have you. So, when I was at HP, I was doing chip design. And marketing was in a different building, as it often is. And I, basically, was getting frustrated, even though I was not there very long, on what I saw all around me, at least at HP, which was a promote from within culture. Over 20 years, you\u2019ll become an engineering manager. And it\u2019s like most people were lifers, as we call them. And that seemed kind of long. I was like do I really want to dedicate the rest of my life to that career path? And then, I was like how could I accelerate this? And that\u2019s when the first idea came along. I somewhat got into marketing, and it seemed like the boss has more than just one narrow functional domain. Maybe I should get some experience over there, and then, I\u2019d be more of an engineering manager if I could know just more than my narrow area of engineering. I thought being an engineering manager was the end goal and learning a bit about marketing and product marketing because it tells the mystery. How are all of these decisions that seem to sort of impact our product development cycles and products getting canceled, things succeeding or failing in the market? That seemed important around what I was doing and not just did I make a breakthrough. So, I guess you could say I wasn\u2019t a scientist in my profession of oh, I\u2019m just doing it to learn the best way to do something. I was engineering through and through, which is I want to have an impact. I don\u2019t want to design a widget that\u2019s going to sit in a room and never get used just because I like to design widgets. It\u2019s like I really would love to have something be meaningful in the world. And so, that\u2019s why I thought about that. And, yes, there was a big distain for marketing amongst the engineers that I worked with. And I did finally get a chance at \u2013 because I wanted to work with Steve Jobs as well, so I got a chance to work at Apple and the software was called Next is when they were moving out of the hardware business into the software only. So, but Next, as it was called. And that wasn\u2019t for me either though. I just didn\u2019t \u2013 something just didn\u2019t click about \u2013 I think it may have been my short attention span and my interest in diverse things that hunkering down to any one thing and committing to do it for five years seemed anathema to my course. That\u2019s why I left the PhD program after two quarters. I\u2019m like I\u2019m not going to write a thesis. That\u2019s like spend four years on one little, narrow area of actually neural networks would have been my thesis area, specifically neural networks applied to parallel processing in computers was what I was starting on. I would have been fascinated by that, but it would have been 20 years too early. Anyway, same thing in any operating job. It\u2019s like I would be either job hopping, the way some people do who have this problem I have, or I\u2019d have to be unhappy, I think, in my job because just the pace change and learning would stagnate so quickly. I would see these patterns over months, not years, that I\u2019m not learning as much anymore. And I\u2019m just executing the same thing over and over again. And so, management consulting was an interesting way to play to that and like all kinds of different client engagements. It just didn\u2019t have the same agency of making it meaningful. In fact, you could point to very vicarious, very diffuse and ambiguous whether you\u2019ve accomplished anything. And so, that\u2019s why all of the management consulting firms say we\u2019re adding value, always talking about measuring how much value we added. All of these things are being said because everyone knows, in their hear, I can\u2019t tell them anything. How do I know if it was me or them? It\u2019s usually them. We can\u2019t really sing our own praises that much. So, I love the diversity of management consulting. I didn\u2019t like the life balance, nor the agency. And so, finally, I discovered venture capital and learned what it was about. It was like the perfect combination for me. Tim Ferriss: Well, your investment, or at least that facet of things you haven\u2019t \u2013 the lens of looking for things you haven\u2019t seen before also suits your programming, so to speak. Steve Jurvetson: Right. And maybe that\u2019s the origin. I hadn\u2019t connected those dots, but it seems obvious now, as I say this to you that that desire to seek something new may have been the driver of that simple rule that I\u2019ve been living my life by, which is invest in something that you haven\u2019t seen before. Tim Ferriss: So, when you\u2019re looking at companies, and I am going to come back to Steve Jobs, I have some questions about Steve and Elon. I know you\u2019ve spent a good amount of time with both. When you\u2019re looking at these companies that have no product that are in the idea stage, there may be some white papers or publications from think tanks or conference panels that discuss these subjects. How do you evaluate deals? Or how do you vet deals? Because I\u2019ve seen a lot of people attempt to go as early as you do but have just gotten their faces ripped off routinely. So, there are \u2013 and, particularly, if you\u2019re trying to be bold. So, not just invest at the early stage, but also go for things that are however many times out of 10 going to fail. How do you avoid running out of bankroll? I\u2019d love to just hear a little bit about what you look for, in a situation like that, at that embryonic stage. What are the check boxes that help you to risk mitigate, if that\u2019s even a consideration? Steve Jurvetson: It is. So, risk mitigate \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Maybe not the right expression. Steve Jurvetson: So, the last one \u2013 but part of the luck I had in starting in the best economic boom for venture you could imagine, the dot com boom, small amounts of capital allowed companies to scale incredibly rapidly. There wasn\u2019t really historical precedents for something that good for venture capital. So, chock part of this up to luck, but the side effect then lasted is that I didn\u2019t have that fearful moment. I didn\u2019t slog through 10 years of just banging my head against the wall of failure, failure, failure, failure. It just was like shooting fish in a barrel to start. So, that I think helped me A) build enough track record that people would give me a bit more slack to pursue something within my partnership, for example, to pursue ideas. I can\u2019t imagine what life would be like if I was stuck in a partnership that wouldn\u2019t give me credibility or let me run with some ideas. And they certainly would push back, believe me. Space X and a bunch of companies like really, you\u2019re going to invest in rockets? Are you kidding me? So, I\u2019d have to defend some of these, but I didn\u2019t get the no, no, no, you can\u2019t do this. So, if I hadn\u2019t had that capacity, in other words, to avoid the inner voice of doubt and the overt critic, both internal and external, I don\u2019t think I could have done what I did in the subsequent years. So, fast forward to midway through my career or into the present day, in other words, the startup phase is a little different than the steady state. So, now that we\u2019re in the steady state, I can realize there will be some failures. That\u2019s fine. And what I then look for is a combination of some personal attributes, market attributes and weirdly of late, sort of process technology attributes. So, I would have, in the past, said technology breakthrough. Of course, there has to be people, huge market, and something disruptive in the technology domain that nano technology or something that we couldn\u2019t have done this five years ago. Oh, that\u2019s another question I always ask every entrepreneur either explicitly or implicitly, if I know the answer, I don\u2019t need to ask it, which is could you have started his business five years ago. And if the answer is yes, then, I don\u2019t want to invest. Tim Ferriss: What are other questions you ask? Steve Jurvetson: Another one I love to ask is so, what does this business look like at 10 years and 20 years out. And what is mind boggling is, unfortunately, how this weeds out the charlatans and the arbitrage seeking opportunists like nothing else. They\u2019re just like deer in the headlights. They never thought 10 or 20 years out. they don\u2019t have any idea. And it\u2019s not because things change so rapidly that you can\u2019t predict 10 or 20 years out. It\u2019s that they don\u2019t have a mission. They don\u2019t have a purpose for why they\u2019re starting their business. If you ask Elon Musk that, he knows right away. If you ask [inaudible] , he knows right away. If you ask Zuckerberg, he knows right away. You ask Larry Page and Sergey\u00a0Brin, they know right away what their business looks like in 10 and 20 years. And they have a mission statement that they hold to their entire life. And it galvanizes the team. It motivates them. That\u2019s why they\u2019re in business. Other people that are I call them arbitrage seekers, when people flock from some industry because there\u2019s gold in the hills, you want to weed that out. This is a great way to weed that way. People don\u2019t tend to have long term visions, if they don\u2019t really have a purpose for what they\u2019re doing. So, on the people side, I increasingly have become enamored with purpose driven businesses, as I was mentioning, or mission driven businesses where making money is not the prime objective. It\u2019s the byproduct of the way they intend to change the world to usher in the transition to sustainable transport and clean energy, to colonize Mars as a couple of easily understood examples. Those are both unique. There aren\u2019t any other start ups at the time proposing to colonize Mars, nor is it something that you get done in a short period of time. It\u2019s like the star on the horizon that galvanizes so much action. Do you want me to loop back to the overall categories, the process stuff, and the other elements? Tim Ferriss: I would love to hear about some of the attributes, yeah. Steve Jurvetson: Sure. So, on the market sides, I think a lot of venture investors, in the early stage, would have the following common answer to your question. I invest in good people pursuing big ideas in enormous markets. But sometimes, they actually won\u2019t execute on that because enormous markets usually means that it\u2019s something really radical that\u2019s changing. There\u2019s a lot of unpredictability. So, if you\u2019re investing in ride sharing, as you did, before it was obviously a good idea, it was not obviously a good idea. And mostly, people probably thought it was a really bad idea. Tim Ferriss: Well, there was an email that Naval Ravikant put up not too long ago, which was the email that was sent out through Angel Lists, which was ignored by something like 297 people out of 300. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: It was not clearly a great idea to everyone. Steve Jurvetson: I would say, when I first invested in Hotmail, I felt this. I felt it when we first invested in Skype. Tim Ferriss: Side note really quickly just because I\u2019m cheating a little bit here. I didn\u2019t know this. Where did the name come from, Hotmail? Steve Jurvetson: It was spelled with a capital HTML, so it was oh, we\u2019re going to do web based email over HTML. It was that dorky. And that was it. And even more interesting, because they were offering free email, they put a lot of effort into the free aspect of this. So, they located in Freemont, California on Liberty Avenue. They launched on the Fourth of July, which is a national holiday, so they got no news pick up. So, it\u2019s all free, baby. So, anyway, those companies were widely regarded as bad ideas. [Inaudible]\u00a0of Hotmail famously was turned down by 21 venture capitalists before he found us. And I would say, without a doubt because I\u2019ve met a number of these venture people at the time the Series A was happening for eBay and Google, the vast majority of venture capitalists would not invest in the Series A. In fact, after the Series A of Google, the two primary investors demanded to get their money back. They wanted to be redeemed, at cost because of a little spat they were having with the founders not getting a new CEO. Not a well known fact. Or one of the major venture investors in Apple sold their entire stake pre IPO. He\u2019s still bragging about being an investor in Apple, of course, but people lose faith in the greatest companies they ever invested in. Tim Ferriss: And I know we\u2019re bouncing around a lot, but that is what I like to do. So, I was doing a bit of homework, and you were very helpful in sending me links to a few things. One was an interview with Jason Calacanis. Steve Jurvetson: Oh, yeah. I love that guy. Tim Ferriss: And you had created a very nifty index of subjects on your Flicker account. And one of the bullets was why I never sell shares of our companies. And biggest misses also. But could you explain what you mean by that? Steve Jurvetson: Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is never sell? Steve Jurvetson: Never. Never sell. It\u2019s a wonderfully liberating stance. And at first, people are like yeah, I can see your face. That doesn\u2019t make sense. Buy low, sell high is kind of our mantra. Yeah, no, I\u2019ve never sold a share. Now, let me add the caveats. When I have control. So, the vast majority of the time, in our business, this would apply, which is we invest in a startup. It either has an IPO or it gets acquired. Those are the two outcomes where it has a \u201cliquidity event\u201d. And IPO, some point after the IPO, years later or at least 180 days later, a venture firm will distribute those shares to its investors. So, I, as a general partner, would get shares. So, I get shares of Tesla. I get shares of you name it. Now, what I choose to do with that is my own personal decision. And from that point on, I have never sold a share. Now, what I do is give them to charity over time. And some might argue that\u2019s kind of a sales decision, but not entirely, partially because it\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to time the market. I\u2019m betting on them in perpetuity. And I\u2019ll give you another answer to why I do this in a moment. But let me flush this one out a little bit more. This has been wonderfully goal aligning with entrepreneurs because, if I\u2019m thinking when is the time to punch out, it\u2019s kind of a corrosive thought process. When they\u2019re thinking, the ones I like, what does the next 20 years look like for this business, how can we make the most out of this next phase of growth because the best companies are like these sort of power laws of compounding potential. Would you want to be punching out? And you wouldn\u2019t of Facebook, at Google 10 years ago. God, that would have been really a bad mistake. And actually, let me jump to the point No. 2. So, the very first advice I got when I was entering this field was from someone who had spent their entire career at the Rockefeller Group, I forget which, the foundation or something. His name is Peter Crisp, and I remember him vividly because I think my first week on the job, it was our first pitch to people who give us money. And here, I met someone who has just come off a long career, sort of winding down slowly, off a long, illustrious career of investing in some of the best companies you can imagine. And his two comments to me were, wow, first, I\u2019m super envious. This young group of people. Starting your career right now, it was like you\u2019re going to love this. I wish I was your age doing this again, this whole second wave. So, here I am changing careers, as we mentioned earlier, not sure which career was made for me. And then, to hear something like that. And the second thing is, looking back over his whole career, he wished he had never sold anything. And I had a similar reaction. What do you mean? He goes, well, I tried to time the market. And if I had just held onto my Apple shares, and who cares what would have happened to everything else. The as if held value today, it would have trumped everything else. I would be a much richer man. I would have avoided all of that anxiety. And that echoed in the back of my mind, to this day. So, in my \u2013 and I won\u2019t share the specifics, but in my personal portfolio, there is a [inaudible] . There is a single company that\u2019s worth more than everything else combined because I have never sold a share. And then, if I look at No. 2, I should go back and do the math. No. 2 plus No. 3 probably, if I think about it long tail, exceeds everything else combined. So, it\u2019s like a traditional power log. And that is pretty amazing. So, I just \u2013 when I made this decision, and also, around the same time, to give it all to charity that was another thing. I created a living trust to give everything but a small, fixed dollar amount to the kids. Everything else is going to go to charity. Then, when you have major crashes, it\u2019s not like, I know this is going to sound weird, I don\u2019t stress that I just lost 90 percent of my net worth because that happened once. It\u2019s like oh, the charity just lost 90 percent of its net worth. And so, I was able to ride it through, and I came right back because I didn\u2019t panic and sell when I literally lost 90 percent of my net worth. Tim Ferriss: I recall seeing, I don\u2019t remember who it was, but one of the \u2013 and there aren\u2019t that many, as you know, but A tier venture capital firms looked at their return on something \u2013 their return to limited partners of the let\u2019s just call it 10 companies that had reached IPO. And that they, subsequently, distributed. And they compared that with the amount made by someone who would have invested the amount in the companies at first opportunity at IPO and ridden it out something like five years. And they would have made just as much money in most of the cases. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. There was a fund called Technology Crossover Ventures I think formed with that insight in mind that says, if you can pick some winners still private and have a judgment from seeing the track record, the passion of the entrepreneur, over a number of years, and then, load up the boat either just pre IPO or at IPO, you could put a large amount of capital work in that. But the key was it was those prior years of exposure that really gave you confidence. So, like my years with Elon allowed me to look at him in a very different way than other entrepreneurs. And if you just, literally, had no prior data, and he just walked in off the street, how would you really know? Tim Ferriss: So, you mentioned Elon. So, you\u2019ve spent time with Jobs, Elon, many other impressive folks. But what are the commonalities you\u2019ve observed, biggest commonalities, biggest differences between those two? Steve Jurvetson: Sure. Well, let me start with differences because I think it\u2019s tempting to draw an analogy. And I\u2019ve been tempted, trust me. But I think it\u2019s really important to keep in mind, so I\u2019ll start there, there\u2019s pretty big differences. Jobs was a marketing centric individual with very weak engineering chops. Elon is more of a physicist turned engineer/computer scientist, basically, deep engineering chops, thinks of everything from first principles of what can be done from the physics and then, scales up to the product vision. Jobs, it\u2019s much more of almost Zen Buddhist approach to parsimonious design and the visceral agitation of imperfection in design space. The famous calligraphy font thing and getting rid of all of the buttons from the phone. There are all of these maniacal missions he had where, at no point, did he clearly lay out here\u2019s the business strategy. You get rid of the buttons, everything moves to the cloud. You have software services there. You can iterate more quickly. This is going to be an awesome business opportunity, if we can get rid of all of the buttons. No, buttons are ugly. Get rid of them. That\u2019s shit. That design is shit, he would say. But he wouldn\u2019t really give this oh, I get it, that\u2019s the master plan. Whereas Elon is like master plan Part 1, master plan Part 2. He lays it all out, and he\u2019s basically executing according to the master plan. There\u2019s actually a really well thought out series of steps to get from here to colonizing Mars. A series of steps to get rid of the petrochemical economy, which is pretty amazing. And it\u2019s all there for anyone to read. That\u2019s like night and day difference. Now, similarities, simple. When CEO of two companies, I think that\u2019s interesting structurally. Not too many people have the chutzpah to do that. And I think, by the way, in both cases, it allows you to focus, interestingly, in a way that you couldn\u2019t otherwise. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I see what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve heard that sentence \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: A CEO of two companies. Tim Ferriss: Each of them independently, CEOs of two companies at a time. Steve Jurvetson: You have Tesla and SpaceX, you\u2019ve got Pixar and either Next or Apple, depending on timeframe. To be fair, Jobs was really not quite the CEO at Pixar, but he was by title. In any case, what you can do though is avoid meetings. Imagine it\u2019s the company holiday party, and you just don\u2019t want to go. No one is going to double guess \u2013 if you\u2019re a normal CEO at a normal company, and you avoid your own holiday party, what better things do you have to do? But this is awesome. You can, basically, avoid time wasting meetings. And you have to delegate more. And so, in both cases, it is an intriguing thought experiment that being CEO of more than one company has some interesting benefits for both companies. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I never thought of it that way. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. The similarity, I think, there is one area in design where the maniacal attention to detail, I described it as this visceral agitation almost painful to Steve Jobs to see things that were not right. There\u2019s a bit of that in Elon as well. I interviewed him once about design, and it sounded so spookily similar in that regard. But in a completely different wrapper, meaning you wouldn\u2019t really know or see it as a similar vector of \u2013 both think it\u2019s just easy. And maybe it\u2019s the sign of brilliance that there are certain parts of this whole space that are intuitive. And they do naturally. And I wish I knew how to A) do it myself, and B) spot it in others. So, everyone also wants to ask how can I raise my kid to be like Elon, or how can I find entrepreneurs that are like him. And if you think about it, just one element of that and how miraculous it is to be able to go into a number of industries, commercial banking, arguably Pay Pal, the aerospace industry with Space X, the automotive sector, the energy competing with utilities with the solar city idea really left field. Now, it\u2019s part of Tesla. But when it started, it was really a left field sector. It wasn\u2019t one industry. That was like that\u2019s energy generation. That\u2019s like competing with regulated facilities. Without any prior business experience in those sectors to become the dominant company in all of them, to have failed at none of them, to be the most important company in all of those fields is kind of mind boggling. It is mind boggling. And the thing that I look for in companies that say we\u2019ve got this mission, as I was mentioning, but we\u2019re going to get this through incremental steps and engaging with customers all along the way. We\u2019re not just going to hunker down for 20 years and then, pop out with colonizing Mars on the other end. To actually paint the picture of how we get from here to there, that\u2019s even more miraculous in some ways. It\u2019s like everyone can have a big dream. Like thousands of people could have the dreams that Elon has. Almost none of them could paint a compelling picture of how to get there. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s where the what\u2019s your 10 year vision, what\u2019s your 20 year vision comes into play. So, Elon has this mythical status for so many people. Just this kind of super who has got everything figured out.\u00a0 I found this article on Business Insider that was talking a little bit about your relationship with him. And there are two things. Actually, two questions I want to ask. So, the first is you called him the most risk immune person I\u2019ve ever met. And then, I have a follow up to that. But what does that \u2013 what\u2019s an example of him being risk immune? And is it because he feels differently in the face of the same risk? Or is it because he defines risk differently or something like that? Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. That\u2019s a great question because I think it\u2019s passed through the filter of the observer. We perceive risk, incredible risk, in some of the things he\u2019s done. I don\u2019t know that we have perfect vision on, and how could we, on really does he perceive the risk the same way we do as external observers. And so, I think part of the answer, and his brother made a somewhat similar statement once, so I feel comfortable at least talking about this, not as if I\u2019m speaking out of school, that here\u2019s one way I could say it externally. I\u2019ve never seen an entrepreneur go all in for his companies, and I say plural, as Elon. Some entrepreneurs will take risks. They\u2019ll quit a job. They\u2019ll spend their entire life savings on some idea. They\u2019ll do whatever. The personal commitment, personal sacrifice. I\u2019ve never seen anything like Elon. And I think this story came out, I was referring back to December 2008, and the darkest period for Tesla. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Musk thought it would take $50 million to get his first trip to Mars, and then, next sentence, he was $200 million in and had \u201cspent all of his money between that and Tesla,\u201d and he went into personal debt by 2008. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. So, 2008, for those that might remember, the financial crisis was happening. For context. At that time, Tesla had just gotten rid of a CEO. Elon had not been the CEO up until then. And it was tough. A large investment bank, one of the most prestigious, had just failed to do a fund raise. This is where you hire them, pay them lots of money, go out and get us the money. You expect it to come in, at the end of this process. They\u2019re like, sorry, we have nothing for you. And the company was rapidly running out of money. In fact, it was heading towards December 2008, and they couldn\u2019t even make payroll. So, Elon wrote a check personally for $3 million, just so they could make the December Christmas time payroll of the employees. But January is going to be just as bad, and there\u2019s no money anywhere. And, by the way, for context, there was no government program. There was no Daimler investment at this point. It was just a company that had a roadster that was negative gross margin. Meaning every car you sell, you lose more money. It was a surprise discovery how bad the proposition was, which is why the CEO was let go. It was like oh, my God, contrary to our belief, we\u2019re actually losing money on every car. And that\u2019s not easy to fix, by the way. Sell more cars does not solve this problem readily. And you had your largest inside investor, this is a term of art in the venture community. There\u2019s a lot of symbolism when your largest investor is or is not supportive of what you\u2019re doing. It doesn\u2019t mean they actually have a lever they can pull to kill you, but the symbolism is bad because they\u2019re in the trenches with you. And if they\u2019re refusing to write a check, that\u2019s a really hard fund raising environment. And the largest investor was as hostile as I\u2019ve ever seen an investor. They did not want Elon as CEO. They did not want anything to do with the company. They wanted to pivot to a different business strategy that seemed a little too cozy that it would support one of their limited partners. And it felt really icky. And they were openly hostile. And he was going through a divorce. And Space X rockets was blowing up, by the way. And he spent every penny he had. So, what does he do? He borrowed $20 million, and he said okay, our lead investor is not here. This large investment bank has failed. I\u2019m going to invest the $40 million that\u2019s needed. He didn\u2019t have $40 million. He said I\u2019m going to invest the $40 million that\u2019s needed. To hell with all of you. Here are the terms. Not to hell with \u2013 but I\u2019m doing it. Train is leaving the station. And it flipped the zeitgeist of you all from fear to greed. And this is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Meaning everyone is thinking what does he see that I don\u2019t see? Steve Jurvetson: And to be fair, there is a dynamic, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen, which is you can have a bunch of people around the table like we were, DFJ was very enthusiastic and wanted to invest, but we can\u2019t do the full $40 million, and we need somebody to be a lead investor, and we\u2019ll do our full share. We, actually, did more than our full share. But somebody has got to step in front of this missing nut, when your largest insider won\u2019t \u2013 and you don\u2019t have any outside money. Someone has got to step up. So, he stepped up and said I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll do the whole thing, if need be. Who is with me? And we took as much as we could. We brought our growth fund in for the first time. And it is an easier decision to say will I write a check let\u2019s say for $2 million, let\u2019s say you\u2019re just one of the random investors there, as part of $40 million, knowing that at least there\u2019s $40 million. At least we\u2019re going to get through this roadster cost problem and be able to turn some cards, if you will. See does the government come through. Does the Daimler relationship actually happen because there are verbal conversations going on? We\u2019ll get resolution at least of those major things. And so, there will be hope to get to the next phase of actually building the Model S car, if all of that falls in our favor. Let\u2019s be part of it. So, our $2 million check leverages the $40 million check. I\u2019m just saying $2 million arbitrarily. So, if all you can do is write $2 million checks, you would never just write a $2 million check. That\u2019s a pier. It\u2019s not a bridge to something. And that\u2019s what A) Elon was willing to do in December, all by himself. And then, B) he was willing to do another one all by himself. I have never seen anything like it. So, he, in retrospect, was perfectly right. Everything went exactly according to plan. This is going to change the world. It\u2019s going to be an enormously valuable company. This was an incredibly good investment to make, at the time, in retrospect. At the time, it seemed like the riskiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve never seen an entrepreneur fund their own company, first when no one else would; second, go net negative by $20 million. Unbelievable. Tim Ferriss: Have you asked him what he was thinking at the time? Steve Jurvetson: Not directly. I didn\u2019t want to \u2013 I liked it. Like this is great. It just felt like the right thing because like I could see the fear going to greed. By the way, in tough times, you sometimes also learn who is going to stand by you and who won\u2019t. And so, that lead investor, and then, also, maybe I won\u2019t mention the names. There\u2019s at least one board member who was like oh, my gosh, they showed their stripes. And there\u2019s nothing like a crisis to know if you\u2019re in the trench with the right person. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Who your fair-weather friends are. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So, to that point, it\u2019s mentioned in this piece that Elon called you around the darkest times, so during some of these really tough periods. And of course, keeping it whatever private should be private, but what does someone like Elon \u2013 you\u2019ve interacted with a number of these people who have incredible capacity to do big things. What does someone like that say to a friend during their dark times? Why do they call friends? Steve Jurvetson: So, I\u2019m not going to relay any specifics, but I could try to get to the gist of the question. I won\u2019t relay any specifics of the phone call. And, to be fair, I don\u2019t even really remember the specifics because there have been so many calls over so many times. So, with the caveat of \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Because if you look at the list of difficulties he was going through, any one of those would \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Would be soul crushing. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Soul crushing. It would completely paralyze and send millions of people into a downward spiral. Steve Jurvetson: So, he has said some things because I don\u2019t want to speak out of school. But there is something I can share that might be helpful. He has spoken himself, and it was like eating glass. That this was a really terrible time. So, he\u2019s made some comments personally, and I\u2019ll just let him speak for what it felt like for him. But I would say that what I\u2019ve observed in that crisis and other crises that we generalize is that he goes into a battle mode of focus that is really remarkable. In this battle mode, it allows him I think to ignore distraction and to have a laser focus on what needs to get done. So, it will sometimes be \u2013 I\u2019ll observe it as these sort of thoughtful, deep moments of like wow, you see it on his face. And you want to give him space to think because I think there\u2019s like, for people, there could be times when you\u2019re generative and thoughtful and brain storming and thinking about all possibilities and the wonder of the world. And there are other times when like you\u2019ve got to solve a problem and focus in. And in those modes, he can avoid distraction like no one else I\u2019ve seen. So, a lot of the smart CEOs and entrepreneurs I\u2019ve worked with are some of them share attributes that I have in spades, which is I\u2019m interested in many things. I\u2019m easily distracted by something. And sometimes, I\u2019d rather avoid the tough crisis and thinking about it, when there\u2019s something more fun to spend time on. And so, I\u2019m almost the opposite of this, just to give credit to how valuable this is. When, let\u2019s say, Tesla has faced various manufacturing challenges, these sort of production hell times that he\u2019s described, he physically sets up his office on the production floor in a very visible area with no walls, so everyone can see that he\u2019s there through the weekend. The vice presidents see that, and that ripples out. When he\u2019s calling a supplier, let\u2019s say he was off because of problems, and he\u2019s like I\u2019m here in the factory, where are you. Why aren\u2019t you here solving this for us? It has a lot of impact. That personal attention to, right now, everything else needs to be gone. I have to solve this problem. I witnessed this, for example, in a more subtle way more recently when I was setting up or trying to set up rather a very interesting phone call between the Mars exploration program for NASA. Craig Vander who is a pioneer in synthetic biology and gene sequencing and gene synthesis. And I wanted to just get Elon on a half hour call because the sort of idea had occurred amongst us that we could do a much cheaper Mars return mission, in other words, if there\u2019s any life on Mars, either archaic or currently living, the best way to explore it would be not to send it back from Mars, which is very difficult, but send a gene sequencer to Mars, sequence it locally, beam the data back, and create the living organism on earth. That actually is doable. And I thought Elon should certainly be interested in this because the next phase of Mars exploration, terraforming, finding out what organisms do live on Mars or not, if they mutate on Mars and actually start thriving, send the data back, create a version on earth to study it here, and more rapidly terraform Mars. He\u2019s like that\u2019s great. He said I can\u2019t take that \u2013 only a half hour phone call. One day, that will be important. Right now, I\u2019ve got to get [inaudible] to fly or there won\u2019t be that need for me to do that. So, I\u2019m like I would love this half hour phone call amongst the three of them. He\u2019s like that can wait a few years, and it can. And that remarkable ability to push aside all of these interesting things when there is I\u2019ve got to get XYZ to ship or fix the problem. And so, fixing the gross margin problem back in 2008, getting a CEO, which turned out to be himself, in place, and solving all of the myriad of problems that were in place was battle mode. And he would also lean on confidants and friends. So, to be fair, there were others like Antonio Gracias and others who really rolled up their sleeves, got on the factory floor \u2013 Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s a close friend. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. He\u2019s amazing. So, folks like that really come and prove that they\u2019re some of the most valuable investors out there. Tim Ferriss: Antonio is happy to fight to support his friends, too. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. I\u2019ll just say it. He\u2019s my favorite investor that I ever met in my entire life. Tim Ferriss: No kidding. We\u2019ll catch up more over a bottle of wine about this. But Antonio and I were in the Henry Crown Fellowship Program together at the Aspen Institute. So, we\u2019ve had a chance to spend a lot of time together. Great guy, absolutely great guy. So, two things come to mind. The first is, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to butcher this, but it\u2019s a quote attributed to Steve Jobs. I feel like there are a lot of misattributed quotes. I\u2019m pretty sure this is accurate. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an Abe Lincoln situation on the internet. But that innovation is saying no to a thousand things. That the \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: I haven\u2019t heard that. Tim Ferriss: In any case, the other was \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: He\u2019s also, by the way \u2013 Jobs was very proud of, when asked what his greatest contribution to the world, his greatest invention, his greatest thing, on his death bed, it was Apple, the organization. And it was really the process learning coming back to something I was starting to talk about earlier. He was focused on the physical space design, keeping the engineers and the marketing people, thinking about where the bathrooms are at Pixar, so you have to walk by certain areas to get to them. He was maniacal about architecting the way people communicate, kicking people out of meetings, if they\u2019re too big. So, he had an intuitive sense about team size long before I did. Tim Ferriss: If the people are over a certain weight class? Steve Jurvetson: No, no, no. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No, I\u2019m kidding. Steve Jurvetson: You don\u2019t want more than seven people on anything productive. No development team. Actually, five is the ideal number. Five plus or minus two. Boards of directors, development teams, creative groups. That\u2019s one of the secret advantages of small companies is they have less people. And they get shit done. When it\u2019s a big company that has hundreds of people and [inaudible] layers of management, they\u2019ve lost the small team dynamic. Tim Ferriss: So, I always like to ask about, and I asked about it with Elon, some of the tougher times or challenges because it\u2019s easy, I think, and I explore this with lots of \u2013 everybody who is on the show, I try to. I ask them about how they try to deal with overwhelm, or if they feel scattered, what do they do. And we talked a little bit about Elon. I\u2019d love to ask you because you recently had an experience that a lot of people have, in the sense that I and many others get their turn as kind of the punching bag. If you\u2019re public facing, you\u2019re going to run into things. And you had an experience recently that I\u2019d love for you to describe, if you\u2019re open to it. And then, I have some follow up questions just about how you then reacted to it. Self talk and things like that. So, maybe, if I could just leave it open. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Maybe it\u2019s an elephant in the room. But in the last couple of months, I have faced the most surreal experience of my career, which is 23 years of venture capital and many before that, all positive press experiences. And then, I faced a bizarre almost autocatalytic, self-generating theme that I hosted a sex party with my fianc\u00e9 in Silicon Valley. And, at first, I laughed. I thought this was hilarious. An ex-geek growing up my whole life with glasses and braces and what have, the notion \u2013 I mean, my first date was in college. And I really thought that was hilarious at first. And then, it got a little more serious. And I\u2019m like wait, this is ridiculous. And the thing that\u2019s even more \u2013 it derived from a book that came out in February where there\u2019s no such claim that we hosted a sex party, but it\u2019s in a chapter about sex parties that other people had. And we just happened to be the only party that anyone mentioned by name. And then, if I try to put a simplistic spin on this or try to make sense of it, it looks like people just didn\u2019t read the chapter very carefully, and they made blog posts or other very sort of nonprofessional postings online that oh, my gosh, the sex party was at Steve\u2019s house. And I\u2019m like what? Not only did the book not say that, it wasn\u2019t true. And by the way, there are 150 people that attended this thing that know it\u2019s not true. And 10 of them go publicly on \u2013 which is kind of a risky thing to do and saying I was at this party, and there was no sex. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Including Elon. Steve Jurvetson: And Musk was like this is irresponsible journalism or something to that effect. And he condemned the writer. And it\u2019s kind of bizarre because I know this author. I\u2019ve been on her Bloomberg television program many times. She knows my email. She knows my cell phone. She never called me for a fact check, which I didn\u2019t realized in book publishing today, in what\u2019s ostensibly a nonfiction category that the publishers do no fact checking. That\u2019s just a fact now. It\u2019s transformed from decades ago. And they leave it up to the writer. And the writer just didn\u2019t even try to see if it was true. And more disturbingly would retweet, even though she never said we had a sex party, she would retweet other people who did. So, some other publication in Europe would say the orgy. So, it starts to grow. The orgy at our house. And she retweets it. And I\u2019m like, really? You know this isn\u2019t true, and I know she knows it isn\u2019t true. But she keeps retweeting it because it sells more books. And I know executives, for example, who have been pressured by their PR people to say positive things about the book because of her ongoing role as a Bloomberg reporter. She had this weird conflict of interest when you want to sell books, and salacious stories sell, to propagate something that\u2019s not true, even if you didn\u2019t say it yourself. And then, turn around and use your leverage and your bully pulpit on Twitter and elsewhere to gain support for your book because you know people want to continue working with you. And you\u2019re going to be \u2013 you\u2019re the journalist of record in the tech industry at one of the biggest news organizations. It\u2019s kind of unfair. So, it feels really horrible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I was going to ask you, how did it feel, and what was your self talk, maybe in the short term. And then, I ask a lot of people about self talk, which I\u2019m fascinated by. So, the day of, let\u2019s just say, when it ceases to be funny, and then, maybe, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m making this up in terms of timeline, but a few days later, when you\u2019ve had a chance to maybe gather your thoughts a bit. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. So, despite the initial burst, almost like a defensive a-ha this is funny, and then, when I really allowed it to sink in, it probably took some number of hours. I\u2019m like wait a minute, for example, there\u2019s 150 \u2013 probably more, in total, but 150 that really knew there was nothing there, and they were there the whole time. They had to explain to their spouses and others like no, I really wasn\u2019t at a sex party. It\u2019s really embarrassing. Those poor people totally innocent. Anyway, and, again, not to condemn a sex party. I\u2019ve never been invited to one. I\u2019ve never held one. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a terrible thing, but let\u2019s just say I haven\u2019t been to one, I don\u2019t want to be accused of one. Tim Ferriss: Just to inject some levity real quickly, so I just moved to San Francisco, this was a long time ago, and one of my neighbors said, \u201cWelcome to the neighborhood. You should come over Saturday. We\u2019re having a party.\u201d And I was like, \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d So, I ended up having a late dinner. And I was like is it too late? No, it\u2019s not too late. Come on over. So, I walk in, and I\u2019m like what is happening here. People in various states of undress and just in time to realize oh, my God, I\u2019m actually at a sex party. There was food served. But I\u2019m like fully clothed with a beanie and a hoodie on. And then, they go everybody sit down. We\u2019re going to do a round of introductions. And so, I sit down, and I\u2019m like how do I get out of this because there are like 40 or 50 people there. And I did manage to scurry out and then say to my neighbor, I won\u2019t name by name, but I was just like, please, in the future let me know. Give me a heads up. And I have nothing against it, but it\u2019s like let me know what\u2019s going on. In any case, it\u2019s like you\u2019re in the Bay Area, so it\u2019s like \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: I\u2019m sure these things happen, I just literally have never been invited to one. It\u2019s not my thing. So, I don\u2019t want to sound too preachy, but it\u2019s just not my thing. And it does feel weird to have a room full of tech executives and some of our closest business colleagues, scores of them aligned in this indirect way. So, the way I felt though is I felt really betrayed. And it wasn\u2019t just the single journalist that I\u2019ve highlighted like wow, what happened to professional journalistic ethics. Like just fact checking and caring about the truth. That\u2019s one branch of disappointment. The other was a little more invisible. I\u2019ll keep this anonymous. But there were a number of people I noticed who would immediately lend support to this idea online. Like either simple things like retweeting something without checking with me. People who ostensibly know me. That was really disappointing. So, I felt betrayed by luckily only a handful. A remarkably small number of people who just \u2013 and, frankly, they were some of my least well known contacts, so these aren\u2019t close personal friends.\u00a0 They\u2019re like let\u2019s say other venture capitalists, just as a category. On the other side, I was blown away by the outpouring of support by people who do know me. So, a couple of co-workers, of ex-employees that I used to work with came out with blog posts. And in every case, it was after they published that I even knew they were putting something together coming in my defense. And like female entrepreneurs of all types were like no, it was anything but this happened at this event. And I\u2019ll be eternally grateful for when times are really tough, you find out a bit more about people\u2019s character, and you find out who is really someone who knows you because someone who knows me knows this is not true. And what\u2019s weird is that I thought it would be obvious to a larger set, but at least the ones that really know me, they don\u2019t even need to ask about it. Oh, my God, dude, what\u2019s going on? This is crazy. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What prevented you \u2013 you had the outpouring of support. You also had a few people show their true colors. Some people, when they get hit with something like that, anything \u2013 I mean, I\u2019ve had periods where it\u2019s like I remember this kind of hit piece came out on me. \u00a0And I\u2019m not saying these are the same thing, but a hit piece came out on me, and it came out on my birthday, at one point, where I have this annual gathering of my closest friends. And it was through a credible, a very well-known publication that had not only \u2013 they had contacted me for fact checking via phone. I had corrected a bunch of misquotes, and then, they ran it as is without making any of the changes. And it really bummed me out. I was considering not doing any interviews ever in the future. Maybe I\u2019ll have to make a number of changes to my life, so that I\u2019m not exposed. And I think that there are certain ways\u00a0 you can mitigate like always doing fact checking, email responses, as opposed to \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Right. Because then, they can\u2019t deny you did it. Tim Ferriss: You always direct it to email. There are a number of different ways that you can risk mitigate there. But was there anything that you said to yourself or that other people said to you that was particularly helpful, at the time? Steve Jurvetson: Let me think about that for a second. Well, the thing that jumps to mind is how supportive my fianc\u00e9, Genevieve, was throughout this. She\u2019s a fighter. And she was at my side throughout. In some ways, it was incredible. And I\u2019m incredibly thankful for her support throughout this. At the beginning of what you were saying, the part that was going through my mind, as you were asking the questions, is that one of the toughest things, and it relates to advice other people gave me, was the advice to not say anything. The advice to be just mum. I got advice from people who focus on PR. I got advice from people who have been through similar situations or worse. Have been accused of crazy things or crimes, falsely accused of crimes, which, luckily, I\u2019ve never been accused of. And in every single case, with zero crack of there\u2019s another side to this point of view, it\u2019s like you say nothing. You do not point out the obvious flaws in these false accusations. \u00a0And the research supporting this is disturbing but true that anything you say, even definitively proving your innocence, will only worsen people\u2019s perception of you at large. Just the mere recanting or resurfacing of that topic to then say it has been decidedly proven false will make people think worse of you on average. Now, from the media perspective. So, in private conversations, that is not the case. And I\u2019ve asked psychologists about this. They\u2019re like no, all of the studies, real clinical/science driven studies show that you do not want to say anything, even to prove your own innocence. So, that\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s like that\u2019s where you\u2019re torn up with all of the virtual conversations you\u2019d like to have with the people who have done you wrong, with the media. It\u2019s because you know you can set the record straight. It\u2019s like I wrote pages of stuff that I never used. Let\u2019s just set the record straight. And my mind played, for months, it would play through here\u2019s what I would say that would just either A) clear it all up, or B) get back at the person who I know is being dishonest to prove they\u2019re being dishonest. \u00a0Say like fess up. How about you won this one? So, that is the most difficult. I really had a hard time with that because, in every other aspect of my life, I don\u2019t have to do that. You can speak openly about like I disagree with you. Well, that didn\u2019t really happen. Or that\u2019s a science based fact or something. As an ex-scientist, I hate that. Tim Ferriss: And so, it seems like this \u2013 you were able to withstand the flack very well. If you think back on it could be at any point in your life, but has there ever been a particularly difficult period for you that you\u2019ve \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: No. Tim Ferriss: No? Steve Jurvetson: I mean, my whole high school. But that was a long, retroactive series of pain of just feeling insecure and like I was a late bloomer. I can tell you about tough times, but there wasn\u2019t like a shock to the system. I mean, I was deeply hurt when my dad died. That was tough. But it was something that\u2019s life. It was a natural cause. Tim Ferriss: That qualifies, too. Steve Jurvetson: But it was tough, yeah. Remorse and \u2013 so, yeah, I\u2019ve gone through some through things, but nothing that was quite like this, which is wow, that really \u2013 someone did me wrong. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, for sure. Steve Jurvetson: I\u2019ve been betrayed as opposed to life has its cycles, and I can feel sad about the passing of a dear loved one. But it\u2019s a different category, I think. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Totally different categories. But I\u2019m interested still in the coping mechanisms or the thinking that goes with this. So, when your dad died, and I\u2019m sorry for your loss, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine, but what was most helpful during the period of grieving or recovering from that? Steve Jurvetson: It wasn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t have a play book of what to do. And what seemed most natural, and it may have been a habit of mine, was to focus on my\u00a0 mom and helping her who survived him, who was there at his side when he passed of a heart attack. \u00a0It\u2019s just one of those things that we\u2019re like why are you trying to revive him, you\u2019re trying to call 9-1-1. My heart went out so much to her and how her situation was worse than mine, in a way, that that consumed almost all of my thoughts for some period of time dealing with I\u2019m the only child in that family, dealing with what needs to be dealt with. I went into sort of almost non emotional operations mode. And it\u00a0 may have been sometime late that night or the next day that I finally allowed myself to cry and really face what I had lost. Part of what gave me incredible solace is perhaps some wisdom I could pass on to others who worry about parents who go. And I know Tim Urban and others have written some wonderful pieces about thinking about your parents, when you\u2019re our parents\u2019 generation, like how many days to you have left with them. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. The Tail End. Everybody should read it. And it was recommended to me, just as a quick side note, by Matt Mullenweg, a mutual friend, wonderful person who also lost his father not too long ago. And he recommended it to me before it happened. \u00a0Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. So, maybe the thing that I took solace in, and I\u2019ll share it for others, is it\u2019s not what you do in the weeks before someone passes that really defines your relationship. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve done over your life. And so, I had been going to the Ted conference. I brought him with me. It was one of the greatest joys of his life for years prior. The fact that we had all of those weeks together, sort of these one on one times, of intellectual pursuits. And a way almost to welcome him into my world, like take dad to work day, in a sense, in this sort of virtual world of ideas and science, technology. When he went through a pancreatic surgery procedure, and just around Thanksgiving, and he came out of it. And I was told by the nurse who first saw him, when he came out of it was that \u2013 because there was a chance he wouldn\u2019t make it even through the procedure. He said, \u201cOh, I get to go to Ted again.\u201d It was like oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s amazing. Steve Jurvetson: So, hearing that, and then, he had complications a few weeks later that he passed from. But just knowing how much that meant to him and how much time I did get to spend with him purposely was it really took the edge off. If we were estranged, if I was at odds with him, then, I\u2019d really, I think, be torn up with guilt of having not come to closure. And we had nothing. He\u2019s my hero. I\u2019ve only had positive thoughts about him throughout my life, so that made it easier, ironically, to lose the guy that I had the best relationship with. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is, as you said, part of the cycle. I\u2019m certainly not looking forward to it. People ask me what do you fear or what are you afraid of. And there are certainly things. Not as many as one might expect. I mean, I don\u2019t want to be eaten by sharks or anything. But I don\u2019t spend a lot of time dwelling on the fear of that happening. Steve Jurvetson: Statistically unlikely. Tim Ferriss: But watching my parents get older and, ultimately, pass away is something that I think qualifies definitely as something that occupies my mind. And I owe Matt a huge debt of gratitude because he led me to The Tail End. I read The Tail End, and that led me a number of years ago to start taking extended trips with my parents twice a year. \u00a0So, at six month intervals, we have not just a trip, which is usually let\u2019s just call it two to three weeks where I usually take them somewhere they haven\u2019t been, but also, the entire period in between during which we can look forward to the trip and plan the trip and talk about the trip. And that anticipation, I feel like, is sort of 70 or 80 percent of the enjoyment of it. So, I owe Matt a huge thank you. And he recommended a book to me I haven\u2019t yet read, but I\u2019m hoping to soon, which I believe is on grief and grieving. And he\u2019s been on the podcast. People look up his last name and grief and grieving, I\u2019m sure the correct title, if that isn\u2019t it, will pop up. But he recommended that everyone read it, even before passing of loves ones. So, we talked about Matt Mullenweg. I pinged him to ask him what subjects or questions might be interesting to explore. And one of them was parenting. So, it\u2019s a good segue. How do you think about parenting or maybe doing it differently is too awkward a question to answer? \u00a0But what are some of the things that you think are important in parenting? Steve Jurvetson: Well, we don\u2019t really get manuals on how to do it. People, young parents, first time parents are just sort of thrust into it. And you find your own way. The only thing I did to prepare for being a parent was to read Scientists in the Crib by Alison Gopnik. It\u2019s not a parenting book. It\u2019s, basically, about the neuroscience of infants through 2 and 3 years old that made it fascinating to study, literally, this incredible creature when they were pre-verbal. It sort of created a bond that some dads lack, I think, when they don\u2019t have that physical connection in nursing or what have you that a mom might have. And yet, to marvel at this creation that is in front of you. Things like how they pick up language, how the [inaudible] system develops. I\u2019m going down a strange rat hole here, but it gave me strange experiments to run like pushing the bassinet on the first day of life under a light overhead that was an L shape, and the baby\u2019s eyes would open immediately every time it went under there because you could actually see it through the closed eye. \u00a0And any edge detection just fires up the brain. So, it\u2019s like if you have visitors, watch this, pop the eyes open. And then, during [inaudible] development, meaning learning language, practicing B and P sounds because it\u2019s like sort of \u2013 we take it for granted, but we learn how to speak by watching others like what are you doing with your lips to make that sound. So, it made young childhood development easy. Then, I got into my groove, which is like my power ally, which is playing with kids, getting down at their level, whether it\u2019s Legos or blocks or whatever and just exploration and fun. So, what I loved about being a parent, in the early years, was an excuse to rediscover [inaudible] or just Legos, in general, and then, [inaudible], which got so much better. The toys have gotten so much better with drones and everything. So, when the kids are older, basically, playing with kids, to me, is super invigorating. And metaphorically, I think a lot of engineers, scientists, and people close to that field like even venture capitalists would do well to try to be creative like a child. \u00a0To engage like a child does with the world in that childlike wonder. Tim Ferriss: yeah. Not to interrupt, but this brings to mind, and just for long time listeners, the reason that I\u2019m not going to ask a lot of my rapid fire questions that I normally do is because Steve, you were kind enough to answer a good number of them in my last book, Tribe of Mentors. But in that, I asked you what you would put on a billboard, and you said celebrate the childlike mind. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: I mean, I didn\u2019t want to interrupt the discussion on parenting, but \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Right. It\u2019s almost like a mantra that came out of parenting, which is I could see how \u2013 and this is something, by the way, that harkens back, indirectly, to this book, Scientists in the Crib, that babies are like scientists. They form conjectures and hypotheses. They test the world. They\u2019re putting things in their mouth. They\u2019re playing with everything. Sometimes, it frustrates the parent. But when you see them as scientists doing experiments and learning how the world works from a sort of boot up phase, it\u2019s metaphorical for what we lose often times after many years of traditional education. They kind of beat the creativity out of you. And I think the best engineers and the best scientists have that kind of childlike mind. You can see it in the writings of Feinman and even Einstein and Newton and others. Newton, I think, once famously said, \u201cI felt like nothing but a child playing on the seashore.\u201d That there\u2019s something deeply resonant about seeing the connectivity in things as a child would and avoiding the strictures and mental ruts that academic disciplines foster and job tracks \u2013 think about discipline, track, those are both two things I don\u2019t like. I\u2019d rather have less discipline and less tracks. I\u2019d rather be exploratory and creative. And so, I found children to be a wonderful opportunity. And it\u2019s such a win/win. You\u2019re connecting with them. You\u2019re mindful. You\u2019re present. And that later rolls into reading with them. I spent a lot of time, and try to, whenever I\u2019m with them, do what they like to do. Engage with them in the kinds of toys and things that they like, and then, push that a little further with all kinds of, how should I put it, tech infused adjuncts to what they might normally be playing with. \u00a0Tim Ferriss:\u00a0We probably don\u2019t have time to go into it right now, in this conversation, but where can people learn about your rockets, your rocket building? Steve Jurvetson: So, I did a short Ted talk on the Joys of Rocketry, I think it was called the Joys of Rocketry. So, ever since my son turned 3, we started launching model rockets. In the story, there was I just went to a local toy store back when they had them, a physical place, and saw these rocket kits ready to fly. And I\u2019m like, wow, I sort of remember rockets when I was little. I wasn\u2019t that into them. I built a couple. And so, we did this. And to make a long story short, I found a mentor that could teach me like you could get really bigger engines and bigger rockets to the present day. I\u2019ve probably launched thousands of rockets. I 3D print these designs. My son and I have been working on this. We go out to the Black Rock Desert every year and launch really big things going well past super sonic speeds, routinely. Launching large rockets, rockets he could fit inside as a hobby. \u00a0That\u2019s probably where I first met Planet Labs was out in the desert launching rockets, as an aside. So, occasionally, good business comes out of it, too. But most of all, it\u2019s this incredible hobby of making science real.\u00a0 Like when something fails to launch or explodes on the pad or comes back in because the parachute didn\u2019t deploy properly, it is just viscerally exciting. I can\u2019t really put my finger on why it\u2019s not universally exciting. To me, it just feels like something everyone should do a little bit of. Tim Ferriss: So, talking about making science real, there were a few tidbits that I pulled from one of your indices on various talks. And they were just seemed like fantastic, attention grabbing headlines, at the very least. Not intended to be that, but I\u2019d be interested in hearing the answer or just a little bit of elaboration on this. One was drones and how to eliminate the TSA. So, what\u2019s the shortish, it doesn\u2019t have to be super short, but explanation of what that means? Steve Jurvetson: Sure. And so, the drones thing is peripheral. But how to eliminate the TSA is an epiphany I had back I think it was around 2005 or maybe earlier, maybe 2003. Post 9/11, TSA is in full effect doing all kinds of crazy things. I think they just implemented the shoe thing for the first time. And I\u2019m at this sort of brain storming effort with them where they gave us the challenge how can we rapidly erratically streamline airport security operations to get on the plane sooner. And this was, at the time, looking at 18 years. I don\u2019t know why 18 years. Maybe it was 2002, and this would be 2020. Maybe it was 2002. And so, I came to that. I think I was the only tech guy there. And I\u2019m thinking 18 years, that\u2019s a long time to predict things. We\u2019d invested, by the way, in some airport security technology stuff, but I didn\u2019t really talk about any of that. I was like 18 years, that\u2019s going to be perhaps 18 doublings of Moore\u2019s Law, which would be 256,000 X compute power. \u00a0What might someone do then that they couldn\u2019t do now? Well, autonomous flight. But it was long before autonomous driving or autonomous flight or drones was a thing. Those words didn\u2019t exist, at least not in the vernacular of products. And I said there\u2019s no question that we could have autonomous flight by then, 18 years in the future, by the year 2020, autonomous planes because already can today, by the way. Air Bus and Boeing, every one of those planes can land better than the pilot could and take off. everything but taxiing is easy compared to autonomous driving. In any case, no one else was on that page. And I said do you realize what would happen if there\u2019s no cockpit? You can make that a really nice first class lounge. The plane can\u2019t be used as a weapon. So, why have any security gateway? So, what you could do instead is go in with some biometrics where you know who is on the plane. Have video surveillance on the plane as the tradeoff. And bring whatever weapon you want on the plane. This would be a really bad place to go kill 200 people because you\u2019re going to get caught. If you\u2019re a terrorist cell, you\u2019re going to get caught. If you can\u2019t use it as a terrorist weapon, then, why have the TSA at all? \u00a0And then, there was the wait, will it really work. And it will if you have autonomous flight, and we should be doing it today with today\u2019s technology, no doubt about it. And you could telematically operate at each airport for the taxi part, if that\u2019s really so hard. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s that hard. And then, you get to go a step further and say what about bombs, maybe the plane falls out of the sky. Your luggage could fly separately in an autonomous thing from the plane itself. You\u2019d have a smaller luggage only plane for the actual cargo part. You could have smaller planes. The whole design space starts to change, in terms of what the optimal design is, if you\u2019re not amortizing a pilot anymore in terms of that operational cost. And you could have multiple flights where there was a single one before, now there\u2019s even less people per plane and more flexibility in your roots. All of this unpacks. And I asked them have you even calculated the economic impact of the shoe policy. And they didn\u2019t know what I meant. I was like you could just take how much time did that just add to the cue of the average traveler times the average salary of the average American and just the economic dead weight loss. And part of what I tried to show them is that the immune response of a system is often worse and what kills you not the pathogen. \u00a0So, it\u2019s often our own immune system that kills us, literally, as the method of death. And I said how long until someone puts a battery on fire? Are you going to keep the laptops and cell phones off of the plane? Do you realize the economic impact of that? And they didn\u2019t want to hear it. And I\u2019m glad that hasn\u2019t happened quite yet. But I\u2019m like that\u2019s what the terrorist cell should be doing to cause the most harm. Have one yahoo make a half assed attempt to light a battery on fire on a plane, and now, look what it would do. Tim Ferriss: I was in a flight from I want to say it was \u2013 I mean, I was on a far flung place, but I think it was Uzbekistan to Istanbul or Istanbul to London. It was one of the two, and we actually had to surrender all of our laptops. And it created the amount of confusion and congestion and craziness that that created was just unbelievable. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, the end of the TSA. Steve Jurvetson: That\u2019s right. Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do you budget, as a technology investor, for regulatory or political opposition from incumbents? And you could look at many different examples of this, whether it\u2019s lobbyists or extremely powerful unions of various types that would be strongly, strongly, strongly incentivized to not allow something like the TSA to go. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. No, with pilot unions. Some people would point out the usual well, you\u2019ve got a bit of an issue here. So, in the past, in the \u201890s especially, when the internet was like you could just do internet for a while, and that was fine, we had the mantra to never invest in a regulated sector. And still, to this day, I try not to invest in anything that requires any law to get passed in order to be in business. And the one exception is we went all in on autonomous driving when the product is currently illegal, but we know it\u2019s going to become legal. Fully Level 5 autonomous driving. With that exception, recently, and the old school, we\u2019d not only try to avoid regulatory environments, we try to avoid if you had to deal with, in any way, as a customer, partner, with utilities or the government or in any of that sector. But I think, frankly, that left a lot of large sectors just \u2013 a lot of entrepreneurs were avoiding them like the plague. So, when Elon opened our eyes and says you can actually take on what might be perceived to be the most non market, if you will, or non-market factors, not like the best product doesn\u2019t necessarily win in the ultra-industrial complex. If you could take that on head on and just win with a better product. And similarly, going up against the regulated utilities with Solar City, so to distribute a solar solution. And yes, they\u2019re fighting with every dirty trick you can imagine. They\u2019re trying every angle. But, sometimes, there\u2019s just such a compelling advantage because there\u2019s been no new interest for 25 years. They haven\u2019t faced a competitive threat in their institutional lifetime, they really don\u2019t know how to behave in response. So, you have, on one hand, yes, they\u2019ll try to do dastardly things. And I don\u2019t know what to say other than you just kind of hope that enough of normal democracy will flourish that you can overcome that and not have critical wounds. \u00a0We\u2019ll see. But on the other side, you don\u2019t usually \u2013 when I was in software investing, as a primary focus, you don\u2019t usually find opportunities to make 100 fold or 1,000 fold cost advantage in a product. But you do, in some of these areas, because they literally have faced no competitive threat for so long, they don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s like to compete. Take like the aerospace industry. There\u2019s a number of Chinese ministers who, early on, when Space X gave the pricing for the Falcon 9, they said those prices are not real. We could not compete at those price points, even if we had all western technology. It\u2019s game over. And other US competitors said we, basically, have to shut down our product lines. Imagine if some competitive Oracle or Microsoft said we\u2019re going to come out with something. And you\u2019re like yeah, you\u2019re right, we better stop selling Windows. Or we\u2019re just going to not do databases anymore because that\u2019s better. No company responds with we\u2019re shutting down our entire product line. And we were the monopolist prior. We were the thing. \u00a0And the only caveat is they say that we\u2019re shutting down our product lines. But government, you\u2019ve got to have another company. So, give us $4 billion, we\u2019ll build a better one. We can do it. We can built it. Get us $4 billion. We forgot to innovate for 25 years, but now, give us a pile of money, and we\u2019ll start. It\u2019s wild. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Tim Ferriss: So, one thing that we chatted a little bit about before recording that I wanted to ask you about is printed organs and synthetic meat. Steve Jurvetson: Hopefully not in the same dish. Tim Ferriss: Hopefully not in the same dish, although you never know. It could be the whole nose to tail. But, in this case, you would have to, I suppose, imagine the exterior would be a figment of your imagination in the case of synthetic meat. But can you \u2013 where are things, currently, with synthetic meat, and where will they be in the relatively near term? And why is it important, for that matter? Steve Jurvetson: I think that\u2019s a great question. [Inaudible]. I think it\u2019s one of the major tech themes or factors that will affect a lot of people\u2019s lives over the next 10 to 20 years. \u00a0And not everyone is fully aware of it yet. And it\u2019s an inevitability. So, back when we were talking about these inevitable futures like all cars will be electric, all vehicles will be autonomous. This is one of those. We will not slaughter animals to get meat. And the question is is that 50 years out? Is that 500 years out? But just like we won\u2019t burn oil and gas 500 years out, there\u2019s no way we would do that 500 years out, especially not in small, internal combustion engines that we won\u2019t slaughter a cow to get a steak. And so, the insight occurs when you realize, first, it\u2019s a much cheaper and efficient way to grow the product you need without the whole cow. The hide. You don\u2019t need the methane production. You don\u2019t need all of the inefficiency that was an artifact of biological evolution. You don\u2019t need the land use, the water use, the energy use. You can cut all of that somewhere between 10 and 100 X, all of those factors, which, by the way, for the listeners that don\u2019t know this, about one-third of all useable land on earth goes to meat production. So, this is the grain that gets fed to cows and pigs and chickens. And the land that those animals live on. So, one-third of all useable land. It\u2019s astounding. It\u2019s one of the biggest water problems, the biggest methane gas, which is one of the most serious greenhouse gas problems. It\u2019s sort of on par with the whole petrochemical economy. Or on the other hand, if you can say I will get rid of oil and gas forever, or I\u2019ll get rid of meat product, you\u2019d be better getting rid of meat production, in the short term, in terms of green house gases and the environment. So, pretty big deal. So, why is this possible? There are two major branches of companies that are trying to solve this. One branch is to replace meat with something that\u2019s not meat. And I applaud those efforts. It\u2019s a little bit more of an engineering challenge to get it past the consumer. And each product has its own engineer. Each and every product is challenging. You make the duck taste like duck, make the chicken taste like chicken. And have it not just be like sausages and hot dogs but actually fillet, if you want to take on the whole corner of the market. So, that will make a meaningful impact and be important. It\u2019s just going to be slow moving because of how hard it is to do each product and to make it anything passable is challenging. Tim Ferriss: Extremely hard. I\u2019ve tried a lot of those products. Steve Jurvetson: People have been trying every which way to do a veggie burger. There are big breakthroughs recently by using heme and plant based heme. Tim Ferriss: Just for those of you who are impossible, that means you get a veggie burger that bleeds, basically. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. They found a root of soy plant that has a molecular cage that holds an iron atom in the center that\u2019s called a porphyrin that\u2019s the same molecule kind of structures that we have in hemoglobin that makes your blood red, that makes it turn color when it gets out of your body, that makes your steak turn red, that makes it taste the way it does, that makes it barbeque the way it does, the way it browns. All of those things you put in a plant. You can also put it, by the way, you can make chicken a red meat. It\u2019s kind of fun. But, anyway, that\u2019s the plant based approach. A lot of engineering, a lot of effort, a lot of money per product. The other [inaudible] we invested in called Memphis Meats and others like that says let\u2019s just make steak. Let\u2019s make chicken. Let\u2019s make any of these products in like not just a substitute, make the exact same thing, but don\u2019t grow it in a cow. So, it\u2019s more of changing the manufacturing method, quite simply. Do you have the cow making the steak, or do you have it in a lab? \u00a0How do you make it in the lab? Well, the team came from cardiology and other medical backgrounds. They have people that have done work in stem cell biology, and people that have worked in the whole synthetic biology area. And it\u2019s pretty straight forward to grow cells. You take stem cells. You can induce them to be [inaudible] or induce them to be immortal, basically, and you can just grow an infinite number of these cells that could become anything. They could become skeletal muscle. They could become nerves. They could become skin. And the way you differentiate them into skeletal muscle, which is like our muscles in our arms, is you put them on a scaffold that causes them to differentiate into that kind of thing. A scaffold that is an edible gelatin like thing. Kind of it\u2019s basically some other food product. Like we have collagen and other stuff. You have this scaffold of things, this [inaudible]. The cells differentiate, and they merge together into these long fibers just like our muscle cells. So, what were formerly discrete, standalone cells form into one long, multinucleated cell. It twitches. It does everything like a normal muscle. It is a muscle cell of that species where I\u2019ve tasted the duck most recently. \u00a0So, it\u2019s duck muscle. And over time, you can add the irregularities of sinew and all of this. But right now, it\u2019s just like a perfect cut of duck muscle. The mouth feel, everything. It\u2019s just the same thing. Tim Ferriss: Everything is a filet mignon. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. And, by the way, in the future, you can make it healthier. You can make it all omega 3 rich oils. You could tune things. But let\u2019s just start with the simple don\u2019t confuse the market with \u2013 it\u2019s not turducken. It\u2019s turkey or it\u2019s duck. It\u2019s not a blend. But you imagine blending is like a simple thing. There\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t do infinite blending like blending a wine to make it just the right mouth feel, just the right whatever. So, but in the near term, let\u2019s not jump ahead of ourselves. It\u2019s just a substitute. And you can do this in small like a Chinese shipping container kind of thing. So, you could put this near the point of consumption. You could have this in urban areas, so you\u2019re not shipping meat all around the country. You\u2019re growing the steak to order. The end cost point should be much, much lower. To me, this had one of those sort of lightning bolt moments of this is the inevitable future. There\u2019s no technical risk that says this couldn\u2019t happen. \u00a0There isn\u2019t like we have to invent something that hasn\u2019t been \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of system engineering to optimize it, the feed stocks, whatever. It\u2019s building the right reactor size. It\u2019s going to take some engineering, but it\u2019s not going to take breakthrough science. It\u2019s the same epiphany that when I first rode in an electric car, when I first had an autonomous ride early on with the Google ones, the old Prius that they had automated, it\u2019s like this is the future. You could just see it like a clarion bell ringing in your head. And then, a few implications started to hit like wow, this will transform the world in a lot of ways. The amount of land and resources and real estate plays that relate to meat production today. Not to mention mad cow disease, influenza, H1N1, all of these other things that those collateral damages of the food industry. We haven\u2019t gotten to that. You can see how we\u2019ll get from here to there, the buyers, the largest buyers of meat would absolutely like to diversify their supply chain, so they\u2019re not vulnerable to influenza or mad cow or any other disruption of the supply chain. You can see how they\u2019re going to want to feather that in. By the way, Tyson and Cargill, two of the largest meat companies in America invested in this company as well in the Series A with us. And but then, I realized something about myself. I realized, for the first time, something where my future self-will condemn my present self as immoral. So, I know that 50 years from now, once I\u2019m eating the bacon and steak that has not killed an animal in its production, will I be able to visit a slaughter house for the first time? I won\u2019t do that today. I like eating meat so much that I refuse to go visit a slaughter house. In fact, of the USDA meat inspectors, 99 percent of them become vegetarian. They don\u2019t start that way. If you see how it\u2019s made, you wouldn\u2019t eat it. And yeah, I won\u2019t do that. And when I say moral, I think humanities circle of empathy expands over time. First, it was family unit. Then, the tribe, the nation state, then, maybe global citizens. Now, I think the interspecies, if you will, empathy is inevitable trajectory where I would welcome that where it would just be more thoughtful about other sentient organisms and their wellbeing that we just look right past today. \u00a0It\u2019s kind of like being a slave owner in America back in the 1700\u2019s. The economy depends on it. I don\u2019t want to ask questions about how those slave ships \u2013 I\u2019m sure slave owners didn\u2019t visit slave ships, and the few that did were like oh, my God, we\u2019ve got to change this. You just don\u2019t want to look. And once you have the economic alternative that doesn\u2019t have any compromises, it\u2019s not like oh, it\u2019s not really bacon, or it\u2019s not really steak, it\u2019s the same thing just no animal died, then, you\u2019ll have the moral shift I think profoundly. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is the current state? What products do they have that \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: They\u2019re still in development because of the cost side at scale. So, this company \u2013 so, when I mentioned the challenge of the plant based substitutes is engineering something that people won\u2019t mistake and that tastes as good. That\u2019s the engineering challenge. Here, the whole thing is just cost because you can make something that\u2019s indistinguishable. It just costs too much right now. And there\u2019s three vectors of making it cheaper. Two are total give mes, and the one is engineering. \u00a0The give mes are just making a bigger plant. So, say you brew beer, if you just have a 1 liter facility on your desk top at home, and you amortize the cost of your home to make 1 liter of beer at a time, it\u2019s going to be an expensive liter of beer, even if the formula is the same as a huge production plant. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0For sure. Steve Jurvetson: So, scale. The second is cheaper feed stocks. Just feed it something other than the very expensive serum they\u2019re using now in RND purposes to minimize variables. They\u2019re using pharmaceutical grade inputs, so to feed the cells, if you will. Tim Ferriss: What do they feed them? Is it like a glucose mixture with amino acids? Steve Jurvetson: It\u2019s like a serum, a blood serum. It\u2019s kind of like what you\u2019d find in your blood to make your blood cells live. So, it\u2019s a variety of substances used for research purposes. But there\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t be \u2013 but the reason it doesn\u2019t exist is there\u2019s no market for food grade plant based feed stocks that cells can grow off of. And now, we have a good reason to do that. And then, the third is just various engineering optimizations on the cells and the mixtures and what combinations of cells. Do you want to try to boost the fat content of each cell or have separate muscle and fat? \u00a0Do you want to have it all be like one bite does all, or do you want to have two different types? Tim Ferriss: Well, a few thoughts occurred to me, as you were describing this. The first is would this company ever utilize the technology to produce human tissue for regenerative medicine or other purposes? And then, I thought to myself, wow, you could also become a moral cannibal, if you wanted. You could produce, not that you would want to produce human burgers and eat them, but you could, ostensibly, do that. But that was just more of a thought. I was like wow, that\u2019s \u2013 Steve Jurvetson: Well, you could also \u2013 a small donor to revive and restore, which is trying to bring back the mammoth and these species. So, you could go back to have the mammoth. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. Steve Jurvetson: Without growing the mammoth. It would probably be gamey. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. The [inaudible] burger. But is that maybe just a distraction? I don\u2019t know the technology well enough to think of it from human medical perspective. \u00a0Steve Jurvetson: No, it is a good question. In fact, the first sort of clean meat or alternative meat company that I came across was using, ironically, the reverse sequence, which is it spun out of a company that was doing organs. They printed bladders. There\u2019s a kid I met who is 18 years old. He\u2019s lived with a grown bladder for many years now. And but that was more like a 3D printer. So, when you\u2019re growing a specific organ that needs to be functional, it\u2019s super important to get a lot of the details right. A chunk of skeletal muscle, if you just take it from the center piece versus the end with sinew. There\u2019s variation if you want to make it function like a muscle. And the connection to your sinews and what have you \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If you\u2019re making ground beef from scratch. Steve Jurvetson: Right. But if you\u2019re getting just a chunk of meat out of the middle, it\u2019s just a chunk of meat. So, you have much bigger challenges with the printed organs that lent itself naturally to a 3D printer kind of approach. And it works wonderfully for some organs. They\u2019ve been growing kidneys and some of the connective tissue stuff around reconstructive surgery for the face and what have you. \u00a0But it\u2019s slow. And it\u2019s also a great example of personalized one to one marketing like you want to grow cells that are compatible with your body, so they would source your stem cells to grow your organ for you. And it\u2019s kind of a different approach, in a number of ways, intuitively from what you want to mass produce for consumption where you could just have who cares what the cow \u2013 it could all be the same cow clone that you\u2019re growing the beef from. Whereas every human implant wants to be immune compatible with what you\u2019ve got. So, the spin out didn\u2019t make as much sense to me to say let\u2019s try to produce metric tons of meat using that 3D printer. In any sense of a 3D printer, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to figure out some way to scale that up. But it just felt like, to me, there was a definite technology risk there to just \u2013 I couldn\u2019t see the hand waving or anything that says why is that going to get 1,000 times better. It could, but I don\u2019t see why it has to. It might not. Whereas this other thing, growing cells in a vat inherently scales. It\u2019s like just have a bigger vat. It\u2019s like it\u2019s 3D to start with. It\u2019s not a 2D layering. There\u2019s something about the manufacturing method that is born out in things like brewing beer and a variety of fermentation tasks where you kind of understand how to generate metric tons of stuff with a fermentation process. \u00a0Tim Ferriss: For people listening, like myself, who are not particularly, I\u2019m being generous, not technically trained, I\u2019m certainly not an engineer by any stretch, who want to make themselves more scientifically literate, are there any books or resources or approaches that you would recommend? Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. There are two things that jump to mind. One is a general purpose overview of what\u2019s important, almost like a survey level, where if you\u2019re just a business executive, and you want to make sure you\u2019re not blindsided by some development that may be relevant but not be a practitioner, and then, there could be a question of is there something that say you\u2019re a former autonomous vehicle driver, and now, you\u2019re looking for the next thing. What might you want to study to engage in the economy as a practitioner? And there\u2019s some areas that are more I think easily approached than others. So, first, on the overall survey, I think there are some writers who do a good job bringing you, with a sort of overview mentality to like what\u2019s really going on in the world. People like Kevin Kelly and maybe Matt Ridley and maybe \u2013 and a few others like this going back with [inaudible]. There\u2019s been a variety. But I might highlight, let\u2019s say, Kevin Kelly because the single book that\u2019s had the most influence on me my entire life is one of his earlier ones called Out of Control. And really, it started my life long fascination of the biological metaphors in technology. Everything from all of that stuff we were talking about earlier about [inaudible] and iterative algorithms and evolution is itself an iterative algorithm. The power of evolution, the power of genetic engineering, all of this stuff. So, he was ahead of his time. He wrote this book in the last century. And it recently got translated to Mandarin. And it\u2019s just in the current day, it\u2019s probably one of the most popular books in China today, even though he wrote it decades ago because it\u2019s actually very relevant today. So, that would be a good starting point, I think. It segues into the technology that either as a practitioner or just you can read about this, if you just direct yourself. \u00a0These are simple Google searches, or I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a particular book I\u2019d point out. Just to learn about deep learning. Learning about neural networks. The reason I say that is I\u2019ve never seen a greater demand for a technology and a scarcity of supply. Like these salaries being afforded to engineers in this area are out of control. A half million dollars for beginners. Tim Ferriss: Who are some of the more credible thinkers or practitioners who talk publicly about deep learning? Steve Jurvetson: Let me think. I\u2019m trying to think if there\u2019s a good overview. The places \u2013 well, I know that Coursera and some of these places are trying \u2013 and Sebastian [inaudible] are trying to do deep learning courses and such. And I haven\u2019t taken those. I don\u2019t know how good they are. Tim Ferriss: I would imagine even some of the very technical people have given non-technical talks, whether it\u2019s at Google or elsewhere. I would imagine some of the thinkers that might be in their day to day work way too technical or specialized have probably given \u2013 \u00a0Steve Jurvetson: This is a tough one. Maybe for your show notes, I can try to come up with something. So, part of the challenge I had is because I started a PhD in this, I didn\u2019t seek the generic books. And I\u2019ve been reading ones that, in the back of my mind, was that too technical. But I bet you I can dig some up. And it may sound self-serving, but I\u2019ve tried to give some of those talks, and when I go to conferences, a number of times, there\u2019s a real dearth of other people doing that same summarization. But I would say that the group out of Canada, so everything from Hinton to Joshua Benjo to Andrew Ng, coming back to the US, in his case, they are both leading edge of RND and such. And they give really good talks. It\u2019s just not all of them. Some of them are deeply technical. Some of them are overviews. So, I\u2019ll try to find, for you, some examples of talks they gave that are for the average person. Tim Ferriss: Perfect. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do then. Steve Jurvetson: Another thing I wanted to say about if someone actually wants to get into it, it\u2019s actually remarkably easy to learn. When I said it\u2019s weird labor market, arbitrage is, I don\u2019t think it takes more than six to eight months to become a real domain expert in this. \u00a0And you don\u2019t have to be spectacularly good at computer science before. The background is just so different from normal computer science that, arguably, a new entrant has a great opportunity to just learn how these things are trained. And forget about normal computer science. Tim Ferriss: And I can say a few things, in response to that. The first is to recommend people check out, so we talked about Tim Urban a little earlier and The Tail End and so on. So, I had Tim Urban on this podcast, and I asked him how he got up to speed on topics. And he went through his exact process. Steve Jurvetson: He just talks to Elon. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Steve Jurvetson: Elon lays it out to him. Tim Ferriss: He just calls Elon. So, for those people interested, if they just search Tim Ferriss Show Tim Urban, that will pop right up. And he spends about 20 minutes talking about exactly this, getting up to speed, which would be, I think, helpful for a lot of folks. And when we chat, after this show, we\u2019ll text or email. And then, in the show notes at Tim.blog/podcast, you can just find this, and we\u2019ll have some additional resources for people who want to, including myself, dig into this and learn more. Have you ever given a \u2013 this will be maybe the last question or second to last question. Have you ever given a commencement speech? Steve Jurvetson: Funny you should ask. Once for my high school, and it was the most terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever done. I love public speaking. I did debate back in high school. And when I\u2019m speaking to an audience that\u2019s somewhat similar to the audiences I\u2019ve spoken to before, check. If it\u2019s on subject that I\u2019ve spoken on before, check. If it\u2019s my [inaudible], I don\u2019t mind that. Oh, my God, trying to be relevant to a bunch of 18-year-olds, wow, that was tough. It was back in Dallas. But I did that a few years back. Tim Ferriss: What did you talk about? And maybe, if it\u2019s broad, what did people respond most strongly to of what you told them? Steve Jurvetson: Oh, I can actually give you show notes. I managed to keep a copy, and someone even translated it in Spanish. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Great. Steve Jurvetson: So, I\u2019m trying to remember what it was. Well, here was the advice I got that really helped was think about when you were their age. And the more time I spent thinking about what life was like for me as a senior, because I went to that same school, it all sort of clicked into place. The what do I want to do with my life, what\u2019s going on in the world, and sort of weaving what I was learning from venture capital and all of the amazing entrepreneurs that I was seeing to convey to them you are entering the most exciting period in human history. And I shared a little bit about things we spoke about on this podcast around things going on in synthetic biology, things going on in AI, and what have you. Each of these areas is so rich with opportunity. And I gave them some general advice about just thinking about your career as a pursuit of passion. Thinking about what you\u2019re uniquely good at that no one else in your random walk through life may have done. And to keep that in mind as you hopefully infuse with a bit of technical open mindedness and creativity and childlike mind in exploration of what you want to do that it\u2019s just like there\u2019s no better time to be entering the world and trying to make a difference. I tried to encourage them all to think entrepreneurially, to think about being change agents for the world, that everything that history books will be written about is some new entrant entering a field they didn\u2019t know much about prior. And then, encouraging them that this is what increasingly defines the world we live in. Tim Ferriss: One question that somebody posed to me, when I was considering the question or considering unique strengths, I was like I don\u2019t know if I have any unique strengths. I do a lot of things kind of well, but I\u2019m not sure. Maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe it\u2019s the pattern I\u2019m imagining across those. And the question that they asked me was what do you find easy that a lot of your friends find hard. And I was like huh. And that actually ended up being a very helpful question for somewhat indirectly landing on the strengths because I had a lot of trouble with that. So, maybe folks will find that helpful. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Because everyone does have some element to that question. \u00a0And they also have something they\u2019ve done that, back to that early question, when I was entering venture capital, how am I different from every other venture capitalist who is trying to do this job. There\u2019s something about your personal background. It could be a language skill. It could be wow, you had to take care of an aging grandmother in your youth, and so you have the sympathy and empathy for what the aged are going through that others lack. That actually could be super hero strength, if you want to be an entrepreneur for this aging demographic of baby boomers. Not everyone, in fact, very few entrepreneurs think about the aged, for example. Tim Ferriss: And your unique strength can also be an unusual combination of two strengths, right? I\u2019ve heard Mark Andreesson talk about layering public speaking on top of anything else and separating yourself. Warren Buffet would say something very similar. Scott Adams of Dilbert fame has talked about this. Let\u2019s say you have an unusual combination. So, maybe you have double the degree, and then, you have an MBA. And then, you know how to debate. You don\u2019t have to be the best in the world at any of those things. Steve Jurvetson: There\u2019s a lot of wisdom there because it\u2019s that pairing. That\u2019s I think why most scientific breakthroughs are interdisciplinary. They\u2019re someone outside of the field of chemistry working with someone maybe in the field to come with a breakthrough, not someone at the core of, again, an academic discipline. And this is why universities are such areas of innovation is because they have all of the disciplines in one physical campus. But if you just had a chemistry department or just a chemistry college, it wouldn\u2019t make world breaking changes. People who figured out the structure of DNA were like an ornithologist and a physicist, not chemists. [Inaudible]. Well, actually Rosalyn Parks needs to get credit. Let\u2019s give a shout out to her. So, she\u2019s the traditionalist in that regard. But more and more people think about Elon not domain expert entering a new domain. It\u2019s the cross pollination by bringing let\u2019s say software design modalities to the aerospace industry. Tim Ferriss: Or calligraphy into personal computers. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. And so, that pairing I think harkens back to one other thought that might bring this whole thing full circle, which is every great idea is a re-combination of prior ideas. This is a really powerful and simple idea that was popularized in three different books at the same time, which I think is meta ironic that their argument, at the same time, is every good idea happens around the same time. \u00a0And the reason that\u2019s interesting is you can think in history, Edison and Tesla and Mark [inaudible], it\u2019s like the time was right given the breakthroughs that had just happened in electricity and magnetism to think about AC induction motors and radio and everything else that got invented by all of those same people are all within months of each other. Today, at large, we have many more ideas. We have the internet allowing us to cross pollinate ideas like never before. These two things that are unique that you pollinate together, the calligraphy and the computer design for Jobs or what have you, the number of possible pairings is growing combinatorial. And I think that\u2019s why we have accelerating change in technology. That\u2019s why Moore\u2019s Law exists over such a long timeframe. It\u2019s not because of the semiconductor industry. It\u2019s because the number of idea pairings is growing as to the end factor, it\u2019s called Reed\u2019s Law, with the number of ideas on the planet. And once you break down the barriers between formally disputed academic disciplines and strip all of that vernacular away, there are independent ways of communicating with each other that are so isolating. And you see the common patterns. It\u2019s like wait a second, that\u2019s just like an information theory I saw there on the microbial design fronts. \u00a0And that same problem \u2013 all of these rich array of new ideas is a sort of meta reason why you can\u2019t really quantify how strong it has to be. We\u2019ll probably see more innovation than ever before. And it\u2019s not just because we go we\u2019ll see more innovation than ever before. It\u2019s because of this combinatorial explosion of idea pairings is happening globally. And oh, by the way, it\u2019s about to explode when the next 4 billon people come online, and we go from 2 to 6 billion people online because of satellite broadband that Space X and others are developing. And that\u2019s all coming in the next five years. Like holy shit, we\u2019re going to have just an explosion of idea possibilities and innovation across the planet. Tim Ferriss: Exciting time to be alive. Steve Jurvetson: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Especially when you have quantum computers accessing potentially parallel universes. Steve Jurvetson: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: Where does it end? It doesn\u2019t. Well, Steve, thank you so much for taking the time. This was really fun. And as meandering as the path I forged, hopefully, you had fun as well. And to be continued. Hopefully, we have many more conversations. And I have so many more questions for you. Steve Jurvetson: Looking forward to it. Tim Ferriss: So, for another time. But where can people find you online to say hello, see what you\u2019re up to? Steve Jurvetson: Sure. So, on Facebook, I\u2019m just user name Jurvetson. On Flicker, user name Jurvetson. That\u2019s the ones that \u2013 most of my old writings are like the old stuff going back to 2004. It\u2019s mostly on Flicker. And then, my social network addiction du jour is Facebook. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And what is next for you? Steve Jurvetson: What\u2019s next? I\u2019m going to start a new venture fund at some point this year. I haven\u2019t picked the name yet, but I\u2019m bouncing some ideas around to focus entirely on purpose driven businesses with really long timeframes where we never sell a share, at least I don\u2019t. And we\u2019ll be investing in the kinds of things we talked about today. Companies that hopefully history books will be written about. Companies whose founders have a purpose greater than their own life on this planet and a purpose greater than certainly making a quick buck. And there are more opportunities and more industry sectors than I\u2019ve ever seen. Like in the \u201890s, it was like software, semiconductors, and life sciences. That was it. I never imagined I would invest \u2013 \u00a0Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And justballs.com. Steve Jurvetson: Yeah. Man, it really went horribly wrong for a while. Just balls and [inaudible] being the pinnacle or the nadir of intellectual curiosity. But now, it\u2019s just a flourishing coral reef of innovation everywhere. And it\u2019s incredibly interesting time to be investing in startups. Tim Ferriss: Can\u2019t wait to see what you do next. Steve Jurvetson: Thank you. Tim Ferriss: And to everybody listening, there will be plenty of links in the show notes, including things we promised, resources to deep learning and much more. And you can check that out at Tim.blog/podcast. And, as always, thank you for listening.

show.\u00a0 [foreign language] my beautiful, little [foreign language]", "this show, as some of you may know, is about deconstructing world class performers, teasing out the habits, routines, life lessons, thought processes, frameworks, and so on from people in many different industries, many different areas of expertise that you can hopefully apply to your own lives", "and my guest today is steve jurvetson, who really has his hand in many, many different worlds", "you can say hello to him on twitter @dfjsteve", "he is a venture capitalist, but a lot more than that focused on founder led, mission driven companies at the cutting edge of disruptive technology", "now, you might think to yourself that\u2019s what i might hear many venture capitalists say", "but he was recommended to me by a past guest as a guest, matt mullenweg who, i trust very implicitly", "if you don\u2019t know d wave, you will very shortly", "he has been the founding venture capital investor in four public companies and many rapidly growing companies like planet, memphis meats, mythic, and nervana, n-e-r-v, nervana", "he also led investments in startups that were later collectively acquired for $12 billion, probably much more, at this point", "before co-founding the firm dfj, draper, fisher, jurvetson, steve was an rnd engineer at hewlett packard, worked in product marketing at apple", "and next, many, many stories about his mentors there", "and then, spent a short stint in management consulting at bain", "he completed his electrical engineering degree at stanford in 2.5 years, think about that for a second, graduating no", "1 in his class and went on to earn all sorts of degrees, msee, mba, etc", "in 2016, president barack obama appointed steve as a presidential ambassador for global entrepreneurship", "steve was also chosen as one of \u201ctechs best venture investors\u201d by forbes and as the venture capitalist of the year by deloitte", "steve will be launching a brand new venture fund sometime later this year", "and you can read about it at future.ventures", "so, not future.com, but future.ventures", "that\u2019s how you would spell it out", "not surprisingly, he will be focusing on passionate founders who are on a mission to make the world a better place with penchant for unique ideas and disruptive technologies", "and disruptive may be an overused term, but steve really understands what that means", "and we dig into some very, very, very specific examples that might make your mind explode", "so, without further ado, please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with steve jurvetson", "steve, welcome to the show", "thank you", "happy to be here", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i am looking here at all my notes, and you were kind enough to send links to various resources, interviews, discussions", "and i have to tell you, i feel a little overwhelmed because, usually, if i have someone on the show, it\u2019s like okay, we have person a, they\u2019re really good at rock climbing", "i think we\u2019ll start with rock climbing", "and in this case, we are not even going to cover 10 percent of the notes that i have in front of me, and they\u2019ve already been winnowed down", "but there is, i think, one story that i came upon that i\u2019d love for you to describe for people just as a starting point", "and it\u2019s a quote, and then, you can give the background from professor david deutsch out of oxford", "and it begins with, and please correct me if i\u2019m wrong, the only way this computer could be as powerful as it is \u2026 what is this quote", "sure", "and i may be paraphrasing because stuff you wrote back in 2002, 2001, at least i read the book of fabric of reality in 2002, and he\u2019s talking about the power of quantum mechanics and the potential for quantum computers", "and in so doing, he and richard feynman both realized that a quantum computer would be fundamentally unlike anything we have in this world today", "and the way that quote roughly ends is that the only way to explain the power of these computers is to invoke the notion that it is sort of engaging the resources across parallel universes", "that if you just use the resources of one universe, there\u2019s so much you can do", "but in this case, you actually are, in the most poetic sense, harnessing almost refractive echoes across parallel universes to do computation in a fundamentally different way", "and that usually bends the mind of most scientists and even physicists to the point of breaking or looking the other way", "and the common response to this is i don\u2019t understand one bit of that", "and it had me captivated", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, i want to jump into a number of areas that i know nothing about or very little about, even though i might use the words occasionally, as people who spend a lot of time in silicon valley are wont to do", "but for people who don\u2019t have the background, i want to highlight a few things about you or, actually, one just as we\u2019re delving into some of the science", "sure", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, your background or a lot of your background is engineering", "so, electrical engineering", "that\u2019s right", "i did a bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, started a phd", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and you were able to do so much of that partially because you finished your undergrad in 2.5 years", "that\u2019s right", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "the point i wanted to make with that, and we\u2019re going to come back to that because i don\u2019t know how that even happens, is that you have technical literacy", "some", "i\u2019m also learning like a child", "so, could you walk us through one of the terms i was hoping to understand for myself, and that is quantum computing", "what is a quantum computer", "right", "a quantum computer is a device", "it\u2019s usually something that is either cooled down to almost absolute zero or has some other phenomenon that it takes advantage of that is at the edge of what is the known universe", "meaning, when you cool something to zero, behavior of materials changes dramatically", "if you have a super conductor, the way it works is dramatically different from normal conductors", "and so, what people have found is that rather than look at quantum mechanics as something that is spooky and bizarre, the way albert einstein even described it, the spooky action at a distance, this ability to entangle things, to have their fates intermingled can be not just sued for things like really unbreakable cryptography and data transmission", "it can also be used in a very bizarre way to build a computer", "and this computer looks something like a row of let\u2019s say rings that either magnetically in one direction or the other", "you think of it in a traditional computer, it\u2019s a one or a zero", "but, actually, it could be everything in between simultaneously much like when you dive into how an atom actually works", "there isn\u2019t an electron at any given point", "it\u2019s a cloud, it\u2019s a probability function around the atom", "well, that cloud is something we\u2019re not used to in the real world", "we\u2019re used to the statistical aggregation of many atoms, just like there\u2019s a table, it\u2019s hard", "i can\u2019t put my hand through the table", "it\u2019s not sometimes here and sometimes over there", "but the farther down you look, the closer and closer to let\u2019s say the atomic scale, you notice the behavior of physics becomes quantum physics", "and rather than being something spooky, you can actually harness this to compute in a very peculiar way", "in a way that \u2013 in a very simple \u2013 well, we could say it\u2019s as if all of your memory bank, in a computer, was a one and a zero simultaneously", "so, you instantly jump or tunnel to the answer you\u2019re looking for to a particular problem", "so, rather than exhaustively searching millions or billions or trillions of possibilities to find let\u2019s say the key that unlocks the digital lock, you just jump to the answer", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s seemingly science fiction, but these computers do exist", "yes", "and even within scientific communities, there is some back biting that says, wait, do they really exist", "is this one an example, or is that just a fast analog computer", "so, it is at the edge of a) what people believe is possible, and i think actually, literally, at this period of history where these computers are starting to come out", "i\u2019ve been on the board of directors of one for over 15 years now", "so, it was a little early for thinking when this is ready for prime time", "it\u2019s now at the point where, for example, google says that their quantum computer that they bought from a company called d wave outperforms their entire data center on certain computational tasks that are important to what they do", "and in other tasks that are meant to really show how fast is it, they found 100 millionfold speed up over the best computer they could buy from anyone else", "how big is such a quantum computer", "they\u2019re almost all about the same size, not because the computer is big but because the cooling apparatus and the shielding from magnetic flux is high", "so, think about a refrigerator size, slightly bigger, like two refrigerators", "the actual computer is just on a little silicon chip that is just as small as any other silicon chip", "it\u2019s just cooled to literally 500 times colder than the most remote part of outer space", "like a few millikelvin above absolute zero, which is really cold", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, to put the speed or power in perspective, could you please describe a graph that i\u2019ve seen you present, which i believe might start with is it 2002", "right", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and it looks like it progresses up to the right almost at a 45 degree angle, not that the angle is that important", "it depends on what\u2019s on the axes", "but could you describe what these different points represent", "it\u2019s something i have affectionately called rose\u2019s law, with a sort of homage to moore\u2019s law because moore\u2019s law is actually named by carver meade", "it wasn\u2019t gordon moore himself who labeled his law moore\u2019s law, nor did jordie rose the founder of d wave", "but when i was first speaking with him in 2002, having just read david deutsch\u2019s book, he had produced a single qbit", "they\u2019re called qbits for quantum bits", "so, i\u2019ll just use the acronym qbit", "he had manufactured one of these and tested and characterized it and had sent to the manufacturing facility \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0now, is the qbit the entire computer", "think of it as, by loose analogy, like a memory array", "it would be like a 1 bit memory array", "but that\u2019s a really powerful memory array", "so, when you go from one to two, you\u2019re now able to explore all possibilities of two to the second power, so four memory states", "if you have three qbits, you could simultaneously explore eight possible memory states, if you have four, sixteen and so forth", "it\u2019s a doubling", "so, as you add a single qbit, you\u2019ve roughly, with some hand waving, doubled the power of your computer, roughly speaking, on the order of a two to the end phenomenon", "so, if you were to add one new qbit every year, which he just stated, so coming to where did this graph come from, he just stated in 2002, i think we\u2019re going to double the number of qbits in a functional quantum computer every year in perpetuity", "and so, i had to ask is that just because gordon moore said something that sounds kind of similar", "and we had a conversation", "i don\u2019t remember being particularly persuaded other than it\u2019s a semi conductive process", "it takes roughly a year to digest the prior generation", "yeah, why shouldn\u2019t we be able to do this", "and sure enough, that\u2019s held until today", "so, it\u2019s been 16 years of doublings", "the way the graph gets interesting though is, as with moore\u2019s law, it comes out of nowhere", "so, moore\u2019s law you could actually trace back hundreds of years, arguably, that our capacity to compute as a species has been doubling roughly every year since we started to compute, since we had any kind of abacus", "it\u2019s kind of weird how this has been growing", "and the semiconductor industry is just the modern version of that", "on a quantum computer, that doubling starts to reach thresholds where you could do things that you could do with any computer on earth", "so, on this graph, if you look forward, and here\u2019s where there\u2019s been a little bit of a time delay, by the way, just full disclosure, where the power of some of these computers, there\u2019s been a bit of overhead", "there\u2019s been a bit of set up and read out times", "there\u2019s been a bit of noise and other things that have made the power of it not \u2013 it still scales like the original curve", "like that 45 degree angle you were painting in people\u2019s minds", "but the power that the represents is \u2013 imagine you have to go two or four times bigger to hit some of these thresholds", "but unless something falls off the rails, we will soon, in the next couple of years, have computers that can out perform any computer on earth", "then, you give it another couple of years", "and it would out perform all computers that could ever be built on earth, even if you use the entire matter of the earth to build them", "and then, this is where david deutsch started to run this thought process out, give it another couple of years", "you would outperform all computers that could possibly be built, if you use the entire matter of the universe at your disposal to build, in the best possible computer any human could ever design, and you gave it the length of the universe in time to work on a problem, it still couldn\u2019t solve these problems, and the quantum computer could in due course, in less than an hour", "that\u2019s when, if your head hasn\u2019t already drilled out of your ears, it just really explodes like pulp", "there are places where nature gives you a peek into its wonders", "and as a scientist or engineer, we get these, in almost any field of exploration, whether it\u2019s inner space of quantum physics or outer space in the frontiers of the unknown", "and here\u2019s one of those examples that just opens your eyes to how little we know in that you\u2019ll sometimes see this, and maybe in an experiment", "i\u2019ll give you an example of one that david deutsch also likes that some people might remember from their high school physics", "if you have two slits, two very narrow slits, and you shine light through them, you get this diffraction pattern on the screen, on the following side of the table", "and that\u2019s always been something we learned at the bulk statistical physics of a lot of photons, a lot of light going and interfering with each other because of the interference patterns", "well, what\u2019s fascinating is if you show single photons at a time, they will shoot through", "and if you just tally up the statistics, they\u2019ll end up creating a distribution pattern just as if it were many photons interacting", "so, the whole explanation of the wave theory of light is that waves interact with each other", "and that\u2019s what creates this pattern, this ripple pattern on the other side", "but there\u2019s no interaction when you\u2019re a single photon at a time", "it\u2019s not interacting with anything, other than its sister photon in a parallel universe", "and david deutsch is like that\u2019s obviously the explanation that makes all of this work other than it bends people\u2019s minds", "and so, the two schools of thought are that\u2019s the answer or i don\u2019t want to talk about it", "what is david\u2019s background", "is he \u2013 he\u2019s a physicist", "tim ferriss:\u00a0just to make sure", "yeah, he knows a lot of what he\u2019s talking about, way more than me", "okay", "yeah", "he\u2019s not a charlatan", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how do you even make sense of that, in terms of considering the implications", "because we\u2019re not talking about thousands of years away, potentially", "this is in the relatively near term future", "what are the implications of that", "so, the key to answering that question is what are these computers good for", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right", "and either good news or bad news, depending on your point of view, is they\u2019re very hard to program at least historically speaking", "years would go by between major advances in the software, if you will, the algorithms that one can run on a quantum computer and do anything useful", "there was something called shore\u2019s algorithm that came out a few years back that said you can actually factor integers, meaning break the number 15 into its prime factors of 3 times 5 is 15", "so, if i give you 15, tell me what the prime factors are", "if the number is small, we can kind of work our way randomly through it through either exhaustive search or some [inaudible]", "but we don\u2019t really have a mathematical way to get the answer", "and a quantum computer now can just give you the answer, which it turns out would break most of cryptography", "any of these mathematical symmetries are at the core of public crypto", "so, that\u2019s kind of worrisome", "what it\u2019s useful for beyond something that spooks should be interested in is we literally are also in the renaissance of software discovery", "so, things that really seem to be coming to the top of near term opportunities or quantum chemistry and deep learning or machine learning, both of which are very interesting", "the quantum chemistry is quite simply predicting accurately what a small molecule will do", "it turns out, if you use a normal computer, and you try to solve [inaudible] equations and do what\u2019s called the bottoms up [inaudible] model like what does a water molecule do, what does aspirin do, how does it behave, you can\u2019t actually model this", "it just computationally grinds to a halt", "quantum computer could do this almost on a one to one mapping", "so, a quantum computer of about the same complexity as h2o and all of its electrons is about the size of computer you\u2019d need to model it perfectly", "like when does it freeze", "what [inaudible] transitions", "all of these weird properties of water that we take for granted that really don\u2019t come from the physics", "we learn this in chemistry, but you don\u2019t learn it in physics because the math", "it\u2019s computationally too complex", "more interesting to me, personally \u2013 by the way, i first invested in quantum computing for quantum chemistry", "that was the reason i got excited about this is we would be able to design drugs more quickly", "i\u2019ll give you an example", "let\u2019s say you have some new h1n1 virus, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how can i design a molecule that would dock to this virus at a particular place.\u00a0 like if i could only attack there chemically, i could kill it", "well, that\u2019s very hard to do, very easy to state, very hard to solve", "so, you can test a drug, but you can\u2019t ab initio just design it out of scratch", "and that\u2019s what these hopefully will be able to do soon", "they rapidly accelerate drug design", "the other are that has enormously wide applicability is in deep learning", "and we can talk more about that field later", "but, generally speaking, building little brains that can learn something very quickly", "let\u2019s say it\u2019s pattern recognition or image recognition for any number of applications and do that much better", "so, that\u2019s why, perhaps, it\u2019s not surprising, google has been the primary customer of quantum computers for the last 10 years is they use deep learning everywhere", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, we\u2019re going to, i\u2019m sure, get to deep learning", "i shouldn\u2019t be so confident", "i have 75 pages of notes", "i will do my best to come back to deep learning, folks", "i\u2019m not yet a deep learner, clearly, with all of the notes that i have", "or neural networks", "that\u2019s the same thing, basically", "if you want to come back to that, we can", "tim ferriss:\u00a0great", "so, i\u2019ll put those on my mysterious pad here", "but a question that is tangentially related, but since you mentioned entanglement, this is something that\u2019s become very interesting to me as a non-physicist, of course, my ability to dig into it is limited", "but i heard i believe it was radio lab, i could be making that up, but an episode of radio lab where they talked about some of the experimental design and results of using lasers to impact entangled i\u2019d suppose it would be atoms, does that sound right, or i\u2019m not sure, maybe sub atomic particles in some cases, they can create what\u2019s called the bose einstein condensate with lasers, in a sense trapping light and making it stop or doing really bizarre things", "yeah", "so, they were looking at entanglement across not just distances within a room but \u2013 i think they sent it in a loop at [inaudible]\u00a0or in europe", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, 60, 70, 80 miles", "and so, i started wondering to myself, again, as a professional amateur that\u2019s not terribly good at any one thing", "it\u2019s like wait a second", "if you were to ask david deutsch, he might just laugh this off as a ridiculous question", "but if the big bang happened, as many people imagine it to have happened or think of it to have happened, is it possible that everything that we can see, hear, feel, touch is entangled", "is there the possibility that everything is entangled", "anyway, that\u2019s a question that i think about, but i\u2019ve never asked a physicist", "i\u2019m not sure", "my gut is not in the powerful way that the quantum computer takes advantage of it", "but there is the possibility of \u2013 first off, for those who don\u2019t know the experiment that you\u2019re referring to, they sent two entangled photons down sort of opposing fiber optic rings", "and then, when they were far apart from each other, miles apart from each other, they would observe one and notice that the other resolved its state instantaneously at the same time", "so, in other words, this notion of quantum indeterminacy that you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a one or a zero or somewhere in between until you look at it", "but the moment you look at it, it changes the state", "it\u2019s this really both strange and provocative notion of the quantum physics", "and literally, we look at one of them over, let\u2019s say, on the left field, miles away, it will instantaneously resolve the other one as well, as if they were a single unit", "and, in fact, you can\u2019t imagine information passing between them because it\u2019s faster than the speed of light that this is at the exact same moment that these things resolve", "i\u2019m going to get out of my depth on so many of these subjects", "i think the main takeaway that fascinated me and maybe hopefully every listener is we are just beginning to scratch the surface of understanding what these phenomena are about and taking advantage of them in any useful way", "so, usually, quantum physicists, literally, since the beginning of the field have been more theoretical than experimental, more theoretical than useful", "and i think the potential crashing of this onto business shores is potentially upon us where, again, when we talk about, let\u2019s say, the power of deep learning, if you could build an artificial intelligence, broadly defined, of any kind, a simple one that plays games or a simple one that recognizes cancer in pathology slides or recognizes anything in an x-ray in medical imaging sense, if you can do that better than anyone else on earth, that\u2019s a business opportunity", "and that capability might start to lend itself to those who have the cutting edge of computation", "and in the past, anyone could buy a computer and catch up with someone who has another computer", "it was a commodity", "i\u2019ll just go buy some more computers myself", "but what if the practitioners of this sort of field are so esoteric and limited that there\u2019s only a handful of companies that know how to do powerful computing", "that\u2019s kind of a worrisome future, potentially", "so, not to dedicate too much time to worrisome futures, but what do you see as the most likely existential or greatest existential risks to humans, animals, people, things on this plant", "i think it would be very for humans, animals, and things", "tim ferriss:\u00a0let\u2019s talk about humans", "yeah", "because i think there are all kinds of things we can do to hurt ourselves that nature won\u2019t have any problem with", "it will march right along", "the cockroaches will still be out there for many years", "tim ferriss:\u00a0since my cockroach audience is still very small, we\u2019ll go with humans", "they\u2019re incredible creatures", "they\u2019re going to last through a lot", "so, i worry about the way in which cultural evolution is, while it\u2019s progressing, it\u2019s not progressing fast enough", "and we, as a society, are going through more rapid and gut wrenching change of various sorts that we may or may not be prepared to handle", "so, for example, we may be in the midst, i would argue, of an ever accelerating rich/poor gap that politicians and policy makers just don\u2019t have their head around and could lead to a future of abundance, as peter diamandis writes about where everything is great because physical things are so inexpensive that even the poorest of the poor could live like kings of just a few years prior", "but i think the cultural, in a sense, set up for this is not necessarily right, which is we don\u2019t have a lot of people thinking about it", "whether it\u2019s how we\u2019ll, let\u2019s say 10 years from now, 20 years from now, will we provide for basic human needs globally", "is it going to be normal capitalism in a democracy", "is that going to work just fine for everyone", "or will there be some that are horribly left behind", "and i think social unrest is something that worries me more and more, i guess, in a succinct way", "there are other things", "i\u2019ve been involved with a nonprofit looking for asteroid defense", "that\u2019s an existential threat of another kind that\u2019s easily addressed", "for less than $400 million, you could take that one off the table", "so, hopefully, that will happen", "pandemic flu or bioterrorism \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0just to pause for a second", "so, take it off the table by building or destroying the \u2013 no, the key is just detecting them long before they hit earth", "so, unlike the movies armageddon or deep impact, you don\u2019t want to wait until final approach to try to do anything about it because breaking it apart turns a bullet into a shotgun shell", "it\u2019s way too late", "what you want to do, and this is what\u2019s so interesting is, for the first time ever, we can put satellites up that have these infrared sensors that can detect these objects at great distances and track them", "and we have enough computational power, from three observation points, model out the end body problem of what will the next 100 years of this object\u2019s orbit look like, and will it hit earth at any point, in the next 100 years", "so, that is a computationally complex thing we can do today", "so, putting up one of those satellites in a near venus orbit looking out to capture all of the threats to earth we could do today with less budget than some museums have", "and the key then is, when you see something that will hit earth let\u2019s say 50 years from now or 30 years from now, you just bump it", "all you have to do is give it the slightest little [inaudible] today, and all of its orbits around the sun, by the time it eventually intersects with earth, it\u2019s in a totally different place", "and we can computationally know, yeah, just rear end it by a tiny bit, or hit it head on by a tiny bit, and then, you\u2019re done", "problem solved", "tim ferriss:\u00a0wow", "but you need time on your side", "it takes years for that tiny nudge to accumulate enough distance delta that you miss something as big as earth", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, i interrupted, i think, your segue to bioterrorism", "yeah", "bioterrorism worried me a lot post 9/11 because i realized, looking into it, and from investments i had made, that it\u2019s increasingly becoming the case that a small number of people, in fact, an individual with let\u2019s say a college education in this field could build weapons of mass destruction", "it used to take armies", "it used to take despots and fascists leaders of countries and resources of countries to wield a weapon of mass destruction, to build one", "tim ferriss:\u00a0using crispr gene editing, things like that", "exactly", "so, synthesizing small pox, weaponizing it, doing something like injecting and looking for a gene, which makes it incredibly deadly and mouse pox", "pox viruses affect all organisms that get to a certain concentration level on the planet", "so, ants, deer, anything that live in dense areas, chicken pox develop a unique pox virus, so that it\u2019s kind of nature\u2019s way of telling you there\u2019s way too many of you people on this planet", "you need to thin the herd", "they can be bioengineered like crazy", "and this worried me because, when i spoke to people in various government agencies who spend their time modeling and doing red team simulations of bioterrorism outbreaks, their only answer, at the time, was well, we hope they wouldn\u2019t do this", "like just kind of like a leap of faith that this is such a horrible thing to wield that people would stop short", "and, at the time, that gave me no comfort", "and as time passes, i actually think there is an element of truth to that", "it\u2019s not the kind of thing the typical terrorist cell can get someone fired up about", "there is a weird thing, even within the worst, what everyone put in quote marks, \u201cworst\u201d parts of societal trouble makers, if you will, on the planet where this isn\u2019t a place they tend to go", "flying a plane in a building is a more natural vector of getting attention for your mission and getting someone to volunteer for the duty than saying i\u2019m going to go kill a bunch of innocent people with a contagious agent", "it\u2019s a kind of weird cross product of threats", "how did you convince yourself of that", "oh, i haven\u2019t", "i worry about it, too", "yeah", "it\u2019s on my top three list of worries", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what are the others", "so, inequality/unrest, bioterrorism, what is my other one?\u00a0 oh, climate change, of course", "oh, my god, climate change", "so, the thing about climate change that worries me is the things i didn\u2019t know", "i\u2019ll give one example", "last week, i learned of a new thing that i really didn\u2019t learn to worry about until last week, which is, of all places, out of nasa aims, the former director was telling me they had been doing these interesting studies trying to figure out how can we induce hibernation in mammals, which, for interstellar travel, would be great", "in the movies, the humans somehow all go into hibernation mode in all of the movies we see", "and they were doing studies with rats", "and they could actually get rats to hibernate for two days, at a time, by exposing them to hydrogen sulfite", "and that immediately led me to ask why is that adaptive", "why would we have this sort of latent pathway that really doesn\u2019t seem useful for anything that puts rats to sleep for two days at a time, and they would die, if it was longer than that", "and it turned out, back at one of the major extinction events, and i\u2019ll try to be more concise here than i might otherwise be, there was a major volcanic outburst", "it led to major climate change", "and the polar ice caps melted", "and the greenhouse effect", "and the problems with the ice caps melting wasn\u2019t the sea levels rose", "that just affects bangladesh and miami, but it doesn\u2019t take out humanity, if sea levels rise", "the thing that could take out humanity is if the ocean currents stop going", "and part of that was driven by fresh water melt off the poles", "so, potentially, long before the poles are completely gone or perhaps completely unrelated to temperature change, if the ocean stopped circulating, you get this complete dead zone where organisms depend on the circulation of nutrients to survive", "and, basically, purple and brown bacteria took over", "and they are these hydrogen sulfite bacteria", "you\u2019d have these waves usually coupled up to two days at a time of just, literally, lethal gases sweeping across the landscape that the survivors learned how to hibernate through", "so, in a long winded way, the thing that both was most interesting, and maybe here\u2019s a hint of how we can induce hibernation in mammals like humans, but also reminder that we\u2019ve had climate change many times on this planet, and really bad things can happen that have nothing to do with carbon or methane or all of the things we\u2019re focused on", "it could be the hydrogen sulfite gas that kills us, which is the rotten smell of eggs", "it\u2019s nasty stuff", "tim ferriss:\u00a0on the social unrest piece, just because i know there are many people out listening who will be wondering this, what do you see as the preventative steps, if any, that can be taken to mitigate that risk", "yeah", "so, first, i was looking at like does it feel like it\u2019s self-correcting", "is it self rectifying", "is there something that\u2019s a natural governing feedback loop, a negative feedback loop that says the rich get richer", "is there something that naturally makes that not continue further", "and, unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of \u201cpositive\u201d feedback loops, not in the normative sense but in the regulatory sense of it just is a runaway thing like runaway climate change", "and that is you can get \u2013 first off, every business becomes an information business over time", "what i mean by that is, if the basis of competition, why is company a winning over company b, is it the way they process information", "is it a software layer to their business", "that i think is rippling through every part of industry, whether it\u2019s the aerospace industry, the automotive industry, agriculture", "it\u2019s not oh, he worked harder", "he was an artisan in his field, that\u2019s why he or she is a better farmer", "it\u2019s oh, he\u2019s got better gene scripts from [inaudible]\u00a0or whoever", "and the basis of competition in agriculture has moved to information tech", "as every industry goes that way, those industries will start to look more like where you see google and facebook, a winner take all kind of dynamic where between firms, you have very few winners", "and within firms, you have very few winners", "so, every fractal scale, it\u2019s kind of like a winner take all", "there\u2019s a few people within these firms that garner most of the wealth", "and there are a few companies that garner most of the wealth in each industry", "now, that\u2019s perhaps \u2013 so, that trend is somewhat negative, and that technology takes over more and more, innervates more and more of the economy", "it subsumes or eats the world, if you will", "i think that would be a side effect", "one other side effect that\u2019s negative is people sometimes reject modernity when they can\u2019t keep up", "you sometimes subscribe to a different belief system, not science and math as the progress vector of humanity.\u00a0 it\u2019s like i\u2019m going to reject science", "i\u2019m going to reject math", "and there are entire countries that are taking this stance, which is scary because they\u2019ll fall farther and farther behind, perhaps, with an inability to catch up to modernity when and if they choose to", "so, that worries me", "the only current \u201cnegative\u201d feedback loop, the thing that prevents wealth from going completely crazy, is that, luckily, and i think maybe understandably, the wealthiest tech entrepreneurs tend not to live like rock stars or rap stars in la", "they tend to give back", "and a simple explanation for me having seen many of these people before they made billions of dollars and after is that, if you\u2019ve made billions of dollars in let\u2019s say under five years, you don\u2019t tend to ascribe that to your incredible hard work and superior intelligence", "it is a farce to hold onto the belief that i am better than others, that\u2019s why i\u2019m a billionaire", "so, they give back in droves", "incredible acts of philanthropy", "and so, right now, the philanthropy governor is the one thing i see that\u2019s at least a positive that says maybe this actually will allow people like gates and others to take on multiyear quests like eradicate malaria or polio", "well, right now, polio and next malaria, in a way the governments can\u2019t even take on", "you have projects that exceed the budget and the gdp of nations", "you have projects that exceed the lifespan of any politician", "and luckily, this is what these people are choosing to do rather than just show off", "and so, i\u2019m really happy about that", "and i\u2019m trying to live my life that way as well", "so, the question of going forward is there are a lot of debates about basic income, universal basic income and experiments that are trying to get funded to see if it works the way people think it might", "i think there could be all kinds of experiments in almost corporate health plans, at large", "so, right now, most companies who have more than 1,000 employees will manage the health plan of their employees", "so, it\u2019s cheaper than going to a third party", "i will actually pay for your healthcare because paying some third party, they\u2019re just making money off of that", "and i\u2019ve got enough critical mass with 1,000 employees that that makes sense", "well, imagine food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare are all equally cheap", "meaning everything costs $1.00 a pound in the world that\u2019s a physical thing", "that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading in the end point", "all physical things should be the same cost", "bag of potatoes, $1.00 a pound", "bag of chips, $1.00 a pound", "a car \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0why is that", "because and then, what you\u2019ll pay for is the software, the intellectual property, the thing that, in certain places, could lock up", "yeah, maybe that ferrari costs more because it\u2019s the design, not the materials", "but it\u2019s just manufacturing methods are all converging, whether you think of it as additive manufacturing or just traditional manufacturing that stuff is not the rare commodity", "you pay for intellectual content like entertainment and software", "that\u2019s what all future economies will be based on", "and physical stuff is all about the same", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what are the means of manufacture", "well, we\u2019re going to grow things, i think, increasingly, in the future", "i think we\u2019re going to grow with algae and other things, chemicals", "so, i think about sheer metric tons of stuff", "liquid chemicals is a big part of it", "and we get almost all of that, 90 plus percent from oil today and the petrol chemical economy", "it\u2019s all going to shift to renewables", "and so, that sort of manufacturing stuff like the stuff that goes into plastics, which is more and more of the physical world that we\u2019re in", "obviously, metals will still come from, unfortunately, metal sources", "but i think it will shift to carbon and other kinds of materials increasingly for structural stuff", "this is, potentially, in the nano tech/carbon economy of the future that building things out of carbon nano tube like structures and meshes is just much lighter materials, effective, and just efficient way of doing things", "so, we could look to nature", "how does a spider\u2019s silk thread outperform almost any other modern material", "and there are startups that are building synthetic silk now with these little nano machines that reproduce what the spinnerets does on a spider", "so, across \u2013 but coming back to just this inequality point and the corporate path potentially there, or it could be a peace corps equivalent that says, if you work for x number of years, you get healthcare, in theory, for a longer period of time", "and why couldn\u2019t that start to subsume, the way some companies already provide lunch for free, why couldn\u2019t, in a sense, basic food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare be provided for free", "and the healthcare part, by the way, right now, is a huge part of the economy, but it shouldn\u2019t be", "i think we\u2019re also, and this is something i want to invest in, we\u2019re going to find a way to make the information search of health free, so we don\u2019t have to pay for the diagnosis", "and i can\u2019t imagine a future where knowing what i need to do to make myself healthy would be something i\u2019d pay for", "the actual doing, if it involved surgery, maybe", "the pills, they should all be $1.00 a pound, the physical thing", "and that future, i think, will be incredibly enabling for changing a society to a stable one where you don\u2019t fear for the health of your children or their ability to live", "then, you could have almost like a renaissance where you pursue the things that are meaningful to you, whether it\u2019s poetry or science or what have you, meaningful work online", "people do this all of the time", "we spend a ridiculous amount of our time on things that aren\u2019t paid but are meaningful to us", "and that, i think, increasingly is what the world will look like in the future", "meaningful work and contributions, not a job, in the traditional sense", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if the pills are $1.00 a pound, how do you maintain the ability to develop and innovate those drugs", "is it just because the computational power becomes so inexpensive that you have then competitors to the current incumbents who are, of course, highly incentivized to protect their \u2013 exactly", "it\u2019s the long run because you could imagine any current phase or even long term, whether you call it transition phase or this is how the new ones come on the market, you have to reward, of course, that effort to the extent that effort is still as expensive as it is today", "you need to recoup it", "and that would be an intellectual property question", "it\u2019s almost, again, like the software of it", "the generic manufacturers know how to make the drug", "it\u2019s but for law around intellectual property that it costs more", "so, the physical manufacturing is still going to be a $1.00 a pound", "now, the question is is it priced as such", "and so, in my model of this, you\u2019d start with the generics and have this massive distribution channel", "if you want to reach a billion people, you could sign onto this platform for the poorest of the poor and reach a billion people at some sort of reasonable cost position for a generic", "but i think the cost of discovery will also come down back to the computational and quantum chemistry side, so that it doesn\u2019t need to take so long and be so expensive", "and right now, you have an fda regulatory system that\u2019s a bit archaic, in that regard, where they aren\u2019t quite set up yet", "and they\u2019re trying to transition, but they\u2019re slow at this, into a world where you have personalized medicine and a world where my medicine is different than yours", "and, therefore, the clinical trial concept really changes", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, we\u2019ve been talking mostly current or i\u2019ll say present and future tense", "i want to go back to that 2.5 years undergrad", "how does such a thing happen", "how is that possible", "it\u2019s interesting", "i took it as a challenge", "when i started at college, i was going to stanford, and i realized it was expensive", "and my folks are immigrants from estonia", "and i kind of found it difficult", "and we were middle class people, at the time, so i didn\u2019t get financial aid", "and i was looking at this", "and i was like this costs a lot", "i just felt guilt", "so, i looked at the various rules for graduation, and it felt like a simple system of equations", "like this plus that has to equal this", "like i actually boil it down to, oh, i see, they\u2019re just trying to get four years of tuition out of you", "so, where can i explore the corner cases", "and so, i came in with the maximum number of ap credits", "so, it actually goes back to my high school, st", "marks in dallas, that incredibly well prepared me for college", "so, i took the maximum number of ap units that i could", "but, of course, universities limit, not surprisingly, how much of that applies", "i also took a couple of summer classes that i could transfer in from another school", "they have a certain number you could do", "i maxed that out one summer, while i was doing summer jobs at hps", "i took night classes", "but, most of all, i learned a trick from the grad students", "this is the key answer, actually", "by the time you get to be a grad student, you realize that you\u2019re limited to something like nine units a quarter", "and that\u2019s kind of limiting, if you take five unit classes, shoot, you can take a class and a half", "so, what they realized is you can sign up for a class for less units than it\u2019s listed, just not more", "so, the check sum on the computer algorithm was not did you say it was a five unit class or say it\u2019s six, and it\u2019s only five", "it\u2019s is it that or less", "so, you can just say it\u2019s even a zero unit class or one", "you just make it whatever you want", "so, you\u2019re not taking more than 20 units a quarter, so you meet that algorithm, yet, you\u2019ve got all of the pre-requisite classes you needed for the next one", "you have to map this out early on", "you have to start freshman year to make this work", "oh, and i had to get a physics teacher to let me take a class and a double e teacher sort of against the pre-requisites saying like i really can do this", "let me try to take your class a year earlier than i should, so that i can get the pre-req chain going", "all of these simultaneous equations you have to solve", "but the signing up for more classes was the key", "there was like one winter quarter where i took the equivalent of eight classes where you would normally take a load of four that made that possible", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, when did, if it did, when did the budgeting stop being a concern", "because you then went on to continue your schooling", "right", "it all flipped completely like total mode shift, when i started my master\u2019s program, and i became a research assistant because that paid for school tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, this is at hp", "well, it was working summer at hp, but i started a master in electrical engineering", "so, it\u2019s still at stanford", "i was a research assistant for professor hennessey who went on to do amazing things there and was an entrepreneur himself, at one point", "and i shifted gears", "i didn\u2019t want to leave school", "going through 2.5 years, the problem is wow, i kind of missed out on a lot of social life and living", "and so, i, basically, at that point, stretched it out and tried to stay as long as i could", "tim ferriss:\u00a0got a balloon payment of recreation", "it\u2019s kind of funny how it suddenly changes", "now, i want to stay", "i don\u2019t want to leave", "and i found a way to be in the freshman dorms as a grad student, which was awesome", "i was the computer coordinator there, which meant that i kept the computers running and kept the paper in the printers", "but it meant i could have freshman dorm life all over again as a grad student", "and it was fun", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, if we look then at your master\u2019s, and i suppose it would have been \u2013 maybe it was simultaneous or after, you could tell us, the mba \u2013 oh, that came later", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that came later", "so, the mba, why did you decide to get an mba", "and would you do it again, why or why not", "a lot of folks who i knew and know are asking that same question", "and i think it\u2019s a challenge that a lot of higher ed is facing, which is is this a vocational thing, is this \u2013 and one unusual thing about business school, it\u2019s the only educational program i know of where everyone comes in with prior work experience", "even law school and med school and what have you, you just go straight in from undergrad", "and so, it\u2019s got a very different kind of feel to it that way", "and people might ask, especially when there\u2019s something like a dot com boom going on in the \u201890s, do i want to step out for a couple of years from the economy and miss maybe that window, that opportunity that might be so ripe", "so, the main reason i went is networking really to expand the \u2013 and to learn, frankly", "but the networking came first in mind", "to meet a bunch of people who come from all kinds of different backgrounds that i could learn from, not only at school but throughout my life", "and one of the sub points on that is, for example, pretty basic questions like what do i want to do in my life", "i had bounced around from engineering to management consulting, prior to business school and thought well, from what i know today, maybe i want to go to product marketing", "i thought that\u2019s what i wanted to do", "but i don\u2019t know", "i don\u2019t know anyone who has done that", "and well, if i go to business school, no matter where i look, there\u2019s going to be plenty of students who have done that in the past, and they\u2019re looking to do something new", "and so, you have all of the consultants trying to leave consulting", "and you have all of the i bankers trying to leave i banking and learn about something new", "what better place", "especially when your employer hoping to leave is paying for it", "exactly", "so, that\u2019s exactly right", "in fact, that was exactly what happened to me", "i was financed by my former employer", "so, i had that sort of safety net", "and then, i decided not to go back, i had to pay for all of my tuition in one check", "yeah, i was wondering how that worked out", "that was a tough decision", "they don\u2019t let that one go", "no, they don\u2019t let it go", "it\u2019s a loan", "and rightly so", "i didn\u2019t expect to get a free ride and not go back", "but it did raise a barrier to leaving", "the other thing is learning", "business was not what i went to learn per se", "i knew there would be some classes about business that i thought would be helpful", "but i\u2019d done so much at bain that i kind of had a small business degree already", "and i had taken classes back when i was an undergrad and a grad student prior in accounting and finance", "so, i had already taken a lot of, again, the core courses", "i placed out of every core course at business school, too, and went right into the electives and the more interesting classes", "but i also knew that it was an opportunity to take classes in other departments, to brush up on actually molecular simulation of all things", "and one of the classes i took was on modeling quantum mechanical properties of materials", "you normally don\u2019t take a class like that", "and that really all played out", "so, did it to what i expected", "in a way, it did", "i didn\u2019t know venture capital existed", "when i grew up in texas, i had heard the term", "i never met a venture capitalist", "never knew anything about them, wouldn\u2019t know how to reach one, no idea", "when i grew up, there wasn\u2019t there internet", "so, i literally would not know how to reach one", "they\u2019re not in the phone book", "there\u2019s no way to find them", "they really aren\u2019t putting up billboards or advertising in any way", "so, the entire transition of the venture occurred because of people i met there", "and i learned a lot", "i should point out good location for it, too", "that\u2019s true, in the middle of silicon valley, that\u2019s true, yeah", "and that\u2019s the only school i applied to, by the way", "if you think about do you want to go to business school, i did not apply to any other school because there was no other school that would have met that goal", "also, i learned a lot", "and back to the network, almost every investment i made, i think it was almost for the first year or two out of business school, and there was a lot because it was the middle of the dot com boom for me, had some business school connection", "it was, literally, the entrepreneurs were from business school, or it was sent to me by a professor from that business school", "for the first year, that\u2019s how i jump started everything i did", "so, my madness/method is usually not chronological", "so, we\u2019re going to zoom out a little bit", "what mistakes do you see otherwise very smart venture capitalists making", "are there any patterns", "are there any particular types of mistakes", "it could be investors, broadly speaking", "oh, my god, tons", "all over the place", "and to be fair, i\u2019ll try to drop in and mention, when i made those same mistakes, by no means am i trying to judge, as if i know better, but two that jump to mind, one is way too many seem to be loss avoidant or fearful", "and i\u2019ll elaborate that in a moment", "and then, but the other one that jumps to mind equally is they think they\u2019ve hit upon the formula for success", "and yeah, that has \u2013 at many different levels at which that\u2019s worrisome", "so, the first one, this notion of being fear driven", "i\u2019ve come across so many investor who will say something like we have a strategy to try not to lose any company, as if that\u2019s like we\u2019re in the trenches", "every company will succeed", "and if you\u2019ve just been at this game for a few decades, you\u2019ll realize that\u2019s just folly", "the earlier you go, the higher your death rate is going to be as a startup", "so, the majority will fail", "just give them time", "and that sad reality took a while to sink in for some", "but until it does, you\u2019re going to be very timid in your investing", "so, most investors i see just let all of the biggest home runs pass them by", "almost every term sheet i\u2019ve written to a company that\u2019s turned out to be a spectacular home run, i had no competition, at the time of the series", "nobody else would invest in the company", "what were the reasons for not investing", "it\u2019s crazy", "it\u2019s way too early", "it\u2019s a science project", "no traction", "yeah", "there\u2019s no product", "so, first off, almost everything i\u2019m doing, there\u2019s no product, no customer yet", "it\u2019s an idea", "it\u2019s in prototype stage of development, or there\u2019s not even a prototype yet", "or they just don\u2019t agree that the world is going to change in this way", "so, and, in often cases, conventional wisdom would support their point of view", "like let\u2019s not invest in any automotive company because every investment since henry ford has failed like 100 percent of them", "they\u2019re just road kill scattered on the highway", "and by the way, many, many start ups funded well over $10 million", "so, decades ago, that\u2019s a lot of money, in the automotive sector, all of which have failed", "many in batteries, many in solar, just scores", "maybe hundreds of companies have failed", "so, when you\u2019ve, let\u2019s say, lost four times in a row, you just give up on the category", "so, sometimes, it\u2019s the more experience grizzled investor that\u2019s like that whole sector, i\u2019m just going to steer clear of it because i have too many scar tissues there", "but that\u2019s not really the thing i\u2019m talking about", "i\u2019m talking about new entrance to the venture business, people who you would think would take a strategy of differentiating myself from my peers, having a basic strategy, let\u2019s say, to say why would an entrepreneur want to work with me versus all of the other firms", "and if it\u2019s like well, i\u2019m investing in the hot sector", "pick whatever it is du jour", "consumer internet or social this or block chain that", "it\u2019s like it\u2019s the hot thing", "yeah, but there are also 100 other people who have the exact same idea you just did", "it\u2019s the hot thing", "why are you different", "and there\u2019s no answer", "so, this lack of strategic thinking and also lack of thinking of a long term strategy", "like okay, whatever you\u2019re doing today, is that going to work 10 years from now, whatever that strategy is", "and i don\u2019t hear strategy from anyone", "like okay, here\u2019s how i\u2019m going to stand out over a sustained period of time", "here\u2019s how i will \u2013 and it can be simple things", "i\u2019ll have a niche", "i\u2019ll only do xyz, and i\u2019ll be known for my niche or my specialty", "what worked for you, in the early days, when you were just getting started", "first, it was a stroke of great luck, which is the dot com boom, as we now call it, was just starting to happen", "and i was ready for that and open minded enough", "so, i didn\u2019t have the scar tissue, which is, by the way, scar tissue for traditional investors was, if you invested in anything, it was like entertainment or media or shrink wrap software, as they called it, which is low priced software for consumers", "that would be the consumer software segment", "that was just a horrible place, games, history of business", "it still is a horrible segment", "it is to do non internet consumer price point stuff", "it\u2019s a death zone", "so, they thought the internet was that", "they didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s an entirely different business model", "what we now know around cloud computing, around subscription services, around viral marketing, it\u2019s potential, none of this was known, at the beginning", "and if you put it into a prior bucket, it would be those are bad sectors", "so, unbelievably, one of the biggest investment opportunities probably the venture industry has ever seen was largely avoided by most venture capital firms", "and when i started in 1995, we did about a third of all internet investing industry wide", "the entire venture industry", "and that quickly changed in \u201996 and \u201997", "and when netscape had its ipo, boom, everything changed because, now, there was an example of a winner", "this pattern will come again in space investing and everything", "as soon as you have a single winner, then, the sheep phenomenon and the herd mentality kicks in", "so, you have scores of people investing in a sector, after it\u2019s had its first win", "so, to your question, being under the tutelage of tim draper to say actually, let\u2019s try to think big", "i credit him for being my mentor into the industry to say not let\u2019s think about it the way bankers do", "let\u2019s not be fearful", "let\u2019s ask the entrepreneur how they\u2019re underestimating their market size", "to think how much bigger might this opportunity be than even the people pitching it are imagining", "and that\u2019s a thought experiment i often like to go through", "and there will be times when, occasional, not often, where i\u2019ll be like, wow, you are so underselling your opportunities", "normally, an entrepreneur is trying to sell, to the maximum extent possible, to predict the largest possible addressable market to think well, phase 1 of my business, i do this", "and phase 2, i take over the world in some way", "and then, to actually try to push them further, and then, want to invest in them, is an interesting adjunct because then, you\u2019re on the same page", "so, i credit tim draper", "i credit the internet", "and then, most importantly, is there was a simple rule i started implementing, and i don\u2019t remember when it started", "it just seemed like the natural thing to do around early stage investing", "so, when i thought about this, i was like, okay, most of the things fail", "if they win, they\u2019ve got to be huge", "okay", "i checked", "they should change the world", "they should be disruptive", "those are words people use", "well, how would i know if something really is big and disruptive", "well, every entrepreneur claims it", "it could be doing a payment processing thing for back in whatever payroll system", "it\u2019s like we\u2019re going to change the world of payroll", "okay", "what really is going to make an enormous opportunity is it seemed to me that a) they\u2019re describing an enormous market", "but b) here\u2019s the killer, no one else has done it before", "and so, the simple rule i\u2019ve used throughout my entire career investing is i want to invest in things that are unlike anything i\u2019ve seen before", "and there are all kinds of [inaudible] that come out of that", "the first is, yeah, you\u2019re investing in some unusual things like d wave back in 2002", "there were no other quantum computer startups, zero, on the planet earth", "there was not a single company claiming to build quantum computers, big or small", "actually, for five years afterwards as well", "so, that one is the most extreme", "maybe for good reasons, no one was doing it back then", "when hotmail first came, there was nothing like it that we\u2019d seen", "when i first invested in skype, there wasn\u2019t anything quite like that", "the way that it did peer to peer voice over ip", "and, similarly, with tesla and electric vehicles", "and i can get into why that one maybe is the most corner case of wait, there are a lot of electric car startups", "why is that one special", "we can talk about it", "but, certainly, space x would qualify as well", "and it\u2019s the unique ideas, at the time, in the start up domain", "and but the benefit from my career was it has me perpetually, searching for the next great technology wave", "so, just when the dot com boom was getting to its fevered pitch, i wasn\u2019t smart enough", "i was not smart enough to predict a crash, and i know that i wasn\u2019t because i was contributing in writings and other things, at that time, saying oh, it\u2019s just the boom is just starting", "it\u2019s going to go up, up, up, up, right", "i believe that because i just wanted to that it\u2019s going to keep going and we wouldn\u2019t have a correction", "but, on the other hand, i was not finding anything unique", "i saw four business plans for selling pantyhose on the web", "like well, we\u2019re going to do [inaudible]", "like three others like really", "four business plans to sell pantyhose or just balls.com", "i\u2019m like \u2013 what does just balls do", "just balls, ventured backed, just sells balls", "the name was awesome", "we got justballs.com", "what do you sell", "balls", "you want a bat", "no", "you want a glove", "no", "we got balls", "balls of all kinds, small balls, big balls, golf balls, tennis balls", "wait a second", "were you a founder", "no", "okay, just making sure", "but this shows you how absurd it got to say take the economy and the internet changes everything", "we\u2019re going to divide up the economy in weird ways it hasn\u2019t been divided up before and make that a business", "so, that\u2019s when i knew this is crazy, and i started investing in nano technology\u00a0 total left field shift", "and there\u2019s a reason i picked that particular sector, but the important point is i didn\u2019t keep investing in the internet companies long past their prime, not because i was smart on when the correction would come, but it was because they weren\u2019t unique anymore", "it\u2019s like every viral marketing idea, at the time, that i could find had come", "now, to my \u2013 so, i avoided a lot of pain", "if you add up every internet \u2013 remember, we did so many of them", "if you add up every internet company we invested in that lost money, add them all up, it was less than single deals lost from other firms", "like buy.com lost more money than everything we\u2019ve ever done combined because we didn\u2019t load up the boat, sort of drink our own kool aid too deep in any one of them", "and every one of them was unique", "so, there wasn\u2019t like this sector risk", "so, you get diversification for free", "by definition, you\u2019re diversified in your portfolio", "and it has me, throughout my career, always on the look out to learn something new knowing that i\u2019m going to have to hop to a new sector", "not saying i\u2019m going to spend my whole life as a semiconductor investor or as a consumer software investor because that is so limiting", "that might have a good 10 year run.\u00a0 but if you\u2019re not continually learning something new at the edges, pivoting from the edges of what you already know to something slightly different, you\u2019re going to become obsolete", "why did you choose nano technology", "that was a bit of a mistake", "but it was a mistake in retrospect", "but the only thing i felt i differentially knew better than others, it was harkening back to \u2013 which, fortunately, wasn\u2019t that many years prior that i had been studying some really hard technologies like molecular modeling and chip design", "i did some chip design at hewlett packard", "so, i had enough, as i looked at the venture landscape, differential knowledge there to say well, there\u2019s something i could harken back to that\u2019s not the internet because the internet, anyone could do, at this point", "and the angel investors are flooding in", "and every banker or consultant is flooding in", "it\u2019s like the landscape is littered with capital and people investing in that sector", "well, there\u2019s nothing going on in nano tech", "i had been exploring at the forsythe institute and a number of other sort of think tank like conferences that the radical potential this had to revolutionize a bunch of things", "and the one part that i think was indicative of what\u2019s to come later in my career, it was not really , in any way, an industry.\u00a0 it isn\u2019t a sector", "it doesn\u2019t describe a company", "there\u2019s no such thing as a nano tech company, unless you\u2019re building tools to service tth industry in a weird way, manufacturing equipment maybe, but not in the attractive sectors", "it more was a set of science and technology capabilities that would stretch across many industries", "so, even today, there will be companies that we\u2019ll meet with and things that were unique from that era will play out like the value of simulation on any molecular system", "like how good is your simulation on any physical thing you\u2019re building, in general", "these questions are process questions", "like how do you do innovation", "how do you do entrepreneurship", "that carries through", "but that platform technology, which let me just tell you what i mean by this", "nano tech was like a platform applied in [inaudible] new ways of doing material science, if you will", "then, there\u2019s this whole field of synthetic biology", "if you can manipulate dna with crispr or other technologies, what are all of the things you can do with that capability", "and it\u2019s very broad", "it\u2019s not just health and food", "and then, more recently, deep learning, neural networks, what we might describe as narrow ai", "that whole field is widely applicable", "i think every company will use it eventually", "so, again, we can come to that later", "but that\u2019s like a platform that\u2019s not \u2013 sure, today, there are some \u201cmachine learning\u201d companies", "all they do is stuff related to machine learning", "but much more interesting is all of the industries that will be changed by the use of machine learning, the vertical industries", "and so, to put a cap on it, nano tech, if you look back at it today, no, there isn\u2019t any nano tech industry", "it would be like saying it\u2019s the thermo dynamics industry", "well, shit, there isn\u2019t one, but there sort of is", "thermo dynamics as a concept, there was a time when, actually, companies named themselves thermo lectron and thermetics", "there are all of these ones that it\u2019s just now subsumed into the fabric of science and engineering", "so, as a geek, i\u2019ve always been fascinated", "are there seed changes in, basically, how we do science and engineering", "maybe that\u2019s the simplest way of saying it", "and i think, today, deep learning is the best example of that", "it\u2019s a fundamentally different way of doing engineering", "tim ferriss:\u00a0say that one more time, the last part", "so, i think deep learning or let me just call it machine learning, broadly, because there are a bunch of sub branches of this", "it\u2019s everything from generative design and sort of the auto desk, cad [inaudible]", "it\u2019s studying [inaudible] the way steve wolfram does", "it\u2019s genetic program \u2013 what are [inaudible]", "these are simple, little mathematical construct that just says, if you\u2019re going to draw \u2013 oh, my god", "you\u2019re probably going to want to edit it out of the final thing because it may not relate to anything other than it created this book, a new kind of science, and really a series of epiphanies from wolfram and others that the world is really interesting when you look at iterative algorithms applied millions and billions of times", "so, [inaudible] is just imagine you started with a random dot or two", "tim ferriss:\u00a0automata like automaton but with \u2013 yeah", "and it sort of unveils", "so, you have this little, simple, almost like a turning machine that says i\u2019m just going to go left to right and look at the dots above me", "and if the dot above me \u2013 i\u2019ll look at the three dots above me", "one directly above me, left, and to the right", "and based on all possibilities of those three dots, which is two to the third power possibilities, i\u2019ll have either a dot or not a dot here", "and so, you would think that such a simple rule that just says look at the three dots, and there are literally only sixteen possible conditions that i could be seeing up there", "i\u2019ll have some other \u2013 i\u2019ll do something", "and, in most cases, it\u2019s very boring", "it\u2019s just like the whole thing is black, or it\u2019s got a nice pattern of triangles", "but in a few case, like rule 31, it unpacks into this incredible complexity that is not repeating", "and there\u2019s no way to jump to let\u2019s say the 40th or the 50th or the 100th layer of this unfolding", "you have to run the experiment", "and the reason i find this so philosophically interesting is this is the same thing in evolution", "it\u2019s the same thing in neural networks", "it\u2019s the same thing in all of these new engineering modalities where you can\u2019t mathematically get a short cut to the answer", "you actually have to just run this little algorithm over and over and over again", "so, you can\u2019t, for example, reverse evolve", "you can\u2019t figure out where did we come from in any direct way", "it\u2019s sort of lost", "you can run the tape forward, but you can\u2019t run it backwards", "you can\u2019t do mathematical short cut across it", "and so, an example of why this is a thought experiment is important is, whenever you\u2019re developing these neural networks, whenever you\u2019re training these little ais, and i think this is the path to ai, in general, so it\u2019s important, this is how it works", "you can\u2019t understand the thing you\u2019ve made, nor can you predict, as you train them further and further, what you\u2019re going to get", "there\u2019s a bit of discovery, emergence, if you will", "it\u2019s kind of like raising a teenager or parenting more than it is programming", "you can learn about the process of creation like i know how to make a teenager, but i can\u2019t tell you exactly how it all works", "and i certainly can\u2019t go in there after i\u2019m done and tweak a few neurons to make them smarter or french speaking or whatever", "it\u2019s like that\u2019s a really weird artifact that works really powerfully", "but it\u2019s not purposeful design", "it doesn\u2019t do what i tell it to do exactly", "it can learn to do what i train it to do, but with some edge cases", "it\u2019s a little out of control", "and that\u2019s what i think the ais of the future will look like", "so, i can come back to it if you want to talk about ai and deep learning", "but i just \u2013 you asked about [inaudible], and the process learning \u2013 the question you started with was engineering, right", "yeah", "so, the thing that i wanted to say is i think deep learning/machine intelligence is the biggest advance in how we can do engineering", "so, specifically, engineering since the scientific method itself", "so, way back when, engineering may have been random like i think astrology is true or i think this is true", "and then, you have the scientific method", "you release the method of compounding knowledge over time", "this is a different way of, in a sense, growing solutions to problems instead of purposely designing them", "you can build things that exceed human understanding", "we\u2019re doing this all over the place in molecular engineering, in software design, in a variety of fields", "we have sort of reached the limit, in many cases, of what a human, any human or even group of humans, can put their heads together and design", "and now, we can push way past that and build things beyond our own understanding, which is pretty powerful", "yeah", "could you define \u2013 just revisit, you might have already done it indirectly, but the deep learning and neural networks", "i guess i have sort of an approximate equal sign here", "i\u2019m not sure if they are the same", "yeah", "they\u2019re synonymous", "in the \u201880s, they were called neural networks and deep learning", "there is a reason the word deep came in", "well, first, you want a new name", "when something kind of came and went and is pass\u00e9 a couple of decades ago, because i studied neural networks back in the \u201880s, you have to give it a new moniker", "but there is a reason", "deep in the sense of more layers", "so, what do they have in common", "and, in fact, neural networks, i think, could be a more generic term for all of this", "it\u2019s inspired by the brain", "it\u2019s a way of simulating a brain like subset", "so, now the whole brain", "but imagine you were to take a little, tiny chunk of your brain, a cortical column or some area and say what\u2019s really going on", "well, you have cells that connect to a bunch of others", "and our brain is hugely a fan out of a thousand or so to ten thousand connections from each one", "so, a huge fan out", "each cell connects to a bunch of others", "and when one fires, it sort of goes down the dendrite, and the little synapse fires, and it triggers another one", "we all have some vague sense of neurons are in our brain, and they\u2019re wired together, and they fire together", "so, if you want to simulate one of those in a very simplistic way, in a way that you imagine the programmers back in the \u201880s, and they had pretty not very powerful computers", "well, how can you make a computer like brain", "well, we don\u2019t need all of that complexity", "we don\u2019t need all of the details of ion channels and synapses and all of the neuro transmitter chemicals that are an artifact of our biology", "what really is the essence of what\u2019s going on here", "and the essence is something activates", "it fires", "it\u2019s connected in a network to some others", "and if there\u2019s enough inputs that are firing beyond a threshold, then, downstream neuron will fire, too", "so, the simple idea is, to recap, neurons fire", "they\u2019re wired to other ones", "you sum up all of your inputs", "everything is connected on the input, there\u2019s like thousands of inputs", "and if it crosses some threshold, then, you fire", "that\u2019s it", "and then, you just layer on tons of these", "and so, the deep learning is having more and more of these layers", "instead of one or two or three layers, having scores of these layers", "and a variety of other algorithmic advances", "but really, the biggest breakthrough has been that we have a lot of data today that we didn\u2019t have back in the \u201880s from the internet, from mechanical turk, you name it, all kinds of data sets to train on", "if you wanted pictures of cats with the label that\u2019s a cat, that\u2019s a dog, that\u2019s obvious today", "we take it for granted", "of course, you want a million of those, do you want a billion", "how many pictures of cats do you want", "in the \u201880s, good luck", "you could spend your whole career trying to get a good data set to train digital networks with", "plus, we didn\u2019t have digital cameras", "it\u2019s crazy, if you think of how little data we had in the \u201880s", "okay", "so, data is the first", "the other is gpus from nvidia", "they started about 10 years ago as a side project in scientific computing realizing \u2013 gpus", "graphic processing units", "so, any gamer would be like i want the latest to play my video games to do all of these polygon renderings offloaded from your main computing chip, the intel chip, usually, off on the side what used to be a peripheral processor or co-processor, an afterthought, if you will, that only gamers cared about", "if you were a business computing user, in the old days, in the \u201890s, you didn\u2019t care about your gpu", "the only thing you cared about was your cpu, the thing that computes your excel spreadsheet or whatever, your database", "but the gpu people were pushing a whole different kind of computational math forward, which was a lot of math", "a lot of polygons", "the more polygons, the more sort of resolution you have in your game", "and so, in a very interesting way, with a different objective function, not do a program that a human wrote faster and faster, but take the same damn simple math of, basically, it turned out to be what\u2019s called matrix multiply and add", "multiply a whole bunch of numbers together and add them up", "multiply, add them up", "it\u2019s like that core mathematical operation, the more you could do, the better your graphics were", "and so, they had an economic incentive to really push the envelope where, if you asked let\u2019s say, in the \u201880s or \u201890s, what else could that be used for, the answer was nothing", "that\u00a0 just does graphics", "it\u2019s like totally optimized for rendering graphics", "but somewhere along the way, people realized, wait a second, there are other areas in the scientific computing world, and by this, i mean, let\u2019s say modeling the weather, modeling nuclear explosions occur in government labs where they\u2019re like we do a lot of that matrix multiplying and add, too", "can we try to see if we could use it", "and so, it was like the skunk works project", "management had no resources against this", "i knew, actually, one of the first four customers working in this rnd area of all things to model how neurons fire scientifically", "to model", "to model how a neuron actually \u2013 the actual biology of a neuron down to as much detail as possible", "a company called evolved machines", "and they were using gpus", "and i remember years ago saying you just bought, for $2,000.00, at the local frye\u2019s electronics store, you just bought more power than any super computer of just two years ago for $2,000.00 because of this domain", "so, this incredible computer resource was pushed to the limits from gaming", "and i think almost poetically, when you think about rendering three dimensional worlds and making them photo realistic, you\u2019re doing something our brain does exquisitely well", "we get an avalanche of information on our retina and our cortex", "and we down scale that to image recognition building over there your face, the symmetry or your eyes", "and much like a neural network, when you train them, it recapitulates our biology", "it builds edge detector, and then, symmetry detectors, and then, eye/face things because you can probe what\u2019s been built a little bit and get a sense of oh, my god, it just recapitulated the sensory cortex in an artificial system", "that\u2019s when the \u2013 recapitulated meaning effectively \u2013 recreated from scratch", "it\u2019s an analog because you\u2019re just training it like a baby", "it gets born, opens its eyes, starts learning", "that\u2019s the same general thing i have with these neural networks", "the fact that it has similar layers in its visual system as our babies do, it\u2019s just that\u2019s when people like me are like oh, my god, this is incredible", "so, back to the gpu thing, what i think is poetic is that something that, in a sense, is meant to be as realistic as possible to our vision system has the kind of computational systems we need to, in fact, do vision systems in let\u2019s recognize cats on the internet, or let\u2019s recognize cancer in a pathology slide", "those general constructs occur because our brain has evolved to do data reduction and pattern recognition in the world in a way that is optimal for what we do, so that when we build thee neural networks, what are they really good at", "all of the same stuff", "and so, all of the applications today are in speech processing, visual processing, which is the simple stuff, the edge of our cortex, and then, naturally, it\u2019s going to start moving into emotional systems and the frontal lobe and the rest of our cortical systems", "and so, that\u2019s why i think it\u2019s the obvious path to ai in the broadest sense", "so many questions", "i love that story or that story/explanation for a number of reasons", "one is how careful one should be with dismissing certain fields", "or even if they seem trivial or to be a waste of time, like gaming", "if you look at the byproduct of the incentives that drove that, and then, the off label uses of gpus, are gpus, am i mistaken in thinking that they also have a role in cryptocurrency mining", "oh, absolutely", "so, that\u2019s a very computationally intense task", "and so, it moved definitely from into cpus to gpus, but then, it even went further", "then, it went to these field programmable gateways and then, to custom chips designed from scratch", "sort of it quickly went down that path", "and deep learning chips will as well", "that was one of my investment themes over the last three years is that deep learning is doing the exact same thing to custom chips", "so, you mentioned something much earlier \u2013 oh, one last thing on this", "nvidia summarized something amazing, and also google did a paper", "the majority of code at google now is built by a computer not by a human because that\u2019s one weird way of summarizing this is when you train a neural network, you\u2019re not coding if, then, else", "you\u2019re setting up the same thing you set up every time", "it\u2019s a very [inaudible]\u00a0\u00a0skill set, by the way", "and you train it, and the computer is generating its own executable, at the end of the day", "the majority of programming is that way now by a factor of 10", "that\u2019s so wild", "and every product that google embodies it from search to you name it, it\u2019s like that is the key technological thing stretching across every google product", "so, you\u2019re so excited by the science, by the engineering", "you mentioned product manager a while back", "and you did, in fact, do that for a period of time, right", "summer jobs, yeah", "what i\u2019ve observed, not always, but very often, at least when i lived in silicon valley certainly, a lot of engineers have a severe distain, or at the very least a distaste, for all things \u2013 most things marketing related", "right", "i remember that at hp, yeah", "it\u2019s just a bunch of hand waving", "yeah", "on so many levels", "so, why did you, with the background you have, set your sights on product managing", "yeah", "so, i remember exactly how this happened", "i was at hewlett packard \u2013 wait, am i getting that right", "yeah", "product marketing, product management, different \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0product marketing", "that\u2019s actually the word i was looking for, sorry.\u00a0 and different firms use the terms differently", "but i was open to both", "in some cases, it\u2019s more engineering rich", "in other cases, it\u2019s what have you", "so, when i was at hp, i was doing chip design", "and marketing was in a different building, as it often is", "and i, basically, was getting frustrated, even though i was not there very long, on what i saw all around me, at least at hp, which was a promote from within culture", "over 20 years, you\u2019ll become an engineering manager", "and it\u2019s like most people were lifers, as we call them", "and that seemed kind of long", "i was like do i really want to dedicate the rest of my life to that career path", "and then, i was like how could i accelerate this", "and that\u2019s when the first idea came along", "i somewhat got into marketing, and it seemed like the boss has more than just one narrow functional domain", "maybe i should get some experience over there, and then, i\u2019d be more of an engineering manager if i could know just more than my narrow area of engineering", "i thought being an engineering manager was the end goal and learning a bit about marketing and product marketing because it tells the mystery", "how are all of these decisions that seem to sort of impact our product development cycles and products getting canceled, things succeeding or failing in the market", "that seemed important around what i was doing and not just did i make a breakthrough", "so, i guess you could say i wasn\u2019t a scientist in my profession of oh, i\u2019m just doing it to learn the best way to do something", "i was engineering through and through, which is i want to have an impact", "i don\u2019t want to design a widget that\u2019s going to sit in a room and never get used just because i like to design widgets", "it\u2019s like i really would love to have something be meaningful in the world", "and so, that\u2019s why i thought about that", "and, yes, there was a big distain for marketing amongst the engineers that i worked with", "and i did finally get a chance at \u2013 because i wanted to work with steve jobs as well, so i got a chance to work at apple and the software was called next is when they were moving out of the hardware business into the software only", "so, but next, as it was called", "and that wasn\u2019t for me either though", "i just didn\u2019t \u2013 something just didn\u2019t click about \u2013 i think it may have been my short attention span and my interest in diverse things that hunkering down to any one thing and committing to do it for five years seemed anathema to my course", "that\u2019s why i left the phd program after two quarters", "i\u2019m like i\u2019m not going to write a thesis", "that\u2019s like spend four years on one little, narrow area of actually neural networks would have been my thesis area, specifically neural networks applied to parallel processing in computers was what i was starting on", "i would have been fascinated by that, but it would have been 20 years too early", "anyway, same thing in any operating job", "it\u2019s like i would be either job hopping, the way some people do who have this problem i have, or i\u2019d have to be unhappy, i think, in my job because just the pace change and learning would stagnate so quickly", "i would see these patterns over months, not years, that i\u2019m not learning as much anymore", "and i\u2019m just executing the same thing over and over again", "and so, management consulting was an interesting way to play to that and like all kinds of different client engagements", "it just didn\u2019t have the same agency of making it meaningful", "in fact, you could point to very vicarious, very diffuse and ambiguous whether you\u2019ve accomplished anything", "and so, that\u2019s why all of the management consulting firms say we\u2019re adding value, always talking about measuring how much value we added", "all of these things are being said because everyone knows, in their hear, i can\u2019t tell them anything", "how do i know if it was me or them", "it\u2019s usually them", "we can\u2019t really sing our own praises that much", "so, i love the diversity of management consulting", "i didn\u2019t like the life balance, nor the agency", "and so, finally, i discovered venture capital and learned what it was about", "it was like the perfect combination for me", "well, your investment, or at least that facet of things you haven\u2019t \u2013 the lens of looking for things you haven\u2019t seen before also suits your programming, so to speak", "right", "and maybe that\u2019s the origin", "i hadn\u2019t connected those dots, but it seems obvious now, as i say this to you that that desire to seek something new may have been the driver of that simple rule that i\u2019ve been living my life by, which is invest in something that you haven\u2019t seen before", "so, when you\u2019re looking at companies, and i am going to come back to steve jobs, i have some questions about steve and elon", "i know you\u2019ve spent a good amount of time with both", "when you\u2019re looking at these companies that have no product that are in the idea stage, there may be some white papers or publications from think tanks or conference panels that discuss these subjects", "how do you evaluate deals", "or how do you vet deals", "because i\u2019ve seen a lot of people attempt to go as early as you do but have just gotten their faces ripped off routinely", "so, there are \u2013 and, particularly, if you\u2019re trying to be bold", "so, not just invest at the early stage, but also go for things that are however many times out of 10 going to fail", "how do you avoid running out of bankroll", "i\u2019d love to just hear a little bit about what you look for, in a situation like that, at that embryonic stage", "what are the check boxes that help you to risk mitigate, if that\u2019s even a consideration", "it is", "so, risk mitigate \u2013 maybe not the right expression", "so, the last one \u2013 but part of the luck i had in starting in the best economic boom for venture you could imagine, the dot com boom, small amounts of capital allowed companies to scale incredibly rapidly", "there wasn\u2019t really historical precedents for something that good for venture capital", "so, chock part of this up to luck, but the side effect then lasted is that i didn\u2019t have that fearful moment", "i didn\u2019t slog through 10 years of just banging my head against the wall of failure, failure, failure, failure", "it just was like shooting fish in a barrel to start", "so, that i think helped me a) build enough track record that people would give me a bit more slack to pursue something within my partnership, for example, to pursue ideas", "i can\u2019t imagine what life would be like if i was stuck in a partnership that wouldn\u2019t give me credibility or let me run with some ideas", "and they certainly would push back, believe me", "space x and a bunch of companies like really, you\u2019re going to invest in rockets", "are you kidding me", "so, i\u2019d have to defend some of these, but i didn\u2019t get the no, no, no, you can\u2019t do this", "so, if i hadn\u2019t had that capacity, in other words, to avoid the inner voice of doubt and the overt critic, both internal and external, i don\u2019t think i could have done what i did in the subsequent years", "so, fast forward to midway through my career or into the present day, in other words, the startup phase is a little different than the steady state", "so, now that we\u2019re in the steady state, i can realize there will be some failures", "that\u2019s fine", "and what i then look for is a combination of some personal attributes, market attributes and weirdly of late, sort of process technology attributes", "so, i would have, in the past, said technology breakthrough", "of course, there has to be people, huge market, and something disruptive in the technology domain that nano technology or something that we couldn\u2019t have done this five years ago", "oh, that\u2019s another question i always ask every entrepreneur either explicitly or implicitly, if i know the answer, i don\u2019t need to ask it, which is could you have started his business five years ago", "and if the answer is yes, then, i don\u2019t want to invest", "what are other questions you ask", "another one i love to ask is so, what does this business look like at 10 years and 20 years out", "and what is mind boggling is, unfortunately, how this weeds out the charlatans and the arbitrage seeking opportunists like nothing else", "they\u2019re just like deer in the headlights", "they never thought 10 or 20 years out", "they don\u2019t have any idea", "and it\u2019s not because things change so rapidly that you can\u2019t predict 10 or 20 years out", "it\u2019s that they don\u2019t have a mission", "they don\u2019t have a purpose for why they\u2019re starting their business", "if you ask elon musk that, he knows right away", "if you ask [inaudible] , he knows right away", "if you ask zuckerberg, he knows right away", "you ask larry page and sergey\u00a0brin, they know right away what their business looks like in 10 and 20 years", "and they have a mission statement that they hold to their entire life", "and it galvanizes the team", "it motivates them", "that\u2019s why they\u2019re in business", "other people that are i call them arbitrage seekers, when people flock from some industry because there\u2019s gold in the hills, you want to weed that out", "this is a great way to weed that way", "people don\u2019t tend to have long term visions, if they don\u2019t really have a purpose for what they\u2019re doing", "so, on the people side, i increasingly have become enamored with purpose driven businesses, as i was mentioning, or mission driven businesses where making money is not the prime objective", "it\u2019s the byproduct of the way they intend to change the world to usher in the transition to sustainable transport and clean energy, to colonize mars as a couple of easily understood examples", "those are both unique", "there aren\u2019t any other start ups at the time proposing to colonize mars, nor is it something that you get done in a short period of time", "it\u2019s like the star on the horizon that galvanizes so much action", "do you want me to loop back to the overall categories, the process stuff, and the other elements", "i would love to hear about some of the attributes, yeah", "sure", "so, on the market sides, i think a lot of venture investors, in the early stage, would have the following common answer to your question", "i invest in good people pursuing big ideas in enormous markets", "but sometimes, they actually won\u2019t execute on that because enormous markets usually means that it\u2019s something really radical that\u2019s changing", "there\u2019s a lot of unpredictability", "so, if you\u2019re investing in ride sharing, as you did, before it was obviously a good idea, it was not obviously a good idea", "and mostly, people probably thought it was a really bad idea", "well, there was an email that naval ravikant put up not too long ago, which was the email that was sent out through angel lists, which was ignored by something like 297 people out of 300", "exactly", "it was not clearly a great idea to everyone", "i would say, when i first invested in hotmail, i felt this", "i felt it when we first invested in skype", "side note really quickly just because i\u2019m cheating a little bit here", "i didn\u2019t know this", "where did the name come from, hotmail", "it was spelled with a capital html, so it was oh, we\u2019re going to do web based email over html", "it was that dorky", "and that was it", "and even more interesting, because they were offering free email, they put a lot of effort into the free aspect of this", "so, they located in freemont, california on liberty avenue", "they launched on the fourth of july, which is a national holiday, so they got no news pick up", "so, it\u2019s all free, baby", "so, anyway, those companies were widely regarded as bad ideas", "[inaudible]\u00a0of hotmail famously was turned down by 21 venture capitalists before he found us", "and i would say, without a doubt because i\u2019ve met a number of these venture people at the time the series a was happening for ebay and google, the vast majority of venture capitalists would not invest in the series a", "in fact, after the series a of google, the two primary investors demanded to get their money back", "they wanted to be redeemed, at cost because of a little spat they were having with the founders not getting a new ceo", "not a well known fact", "or one of the major venture investors in apple sold their entire stake pre ipo", "he\u2019s still bragging about being an investor in apple, of course, but people lose faith in the greatest companies they ever invested in", "and i know we\u2019re bouncing around a lot, but that is what i like to do", "so, i was doing a bit of homework, and you were very helpful in sending me links to a few things", "one was an interview with jason calacanis", "oh, yeah", "i love that guy", "and you had created a very nifty index of subjects on your flicker account", "and one of the bullets was why i never sell shares of our companies", "and biggest misses also", "but could you explain what you mean by that", "sure", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what is never sell", "never", "never sell", "it\u2019s a wonderfully liberating stance", "and at first, people are like yeah, i can see your face", "that doesn\u2019t make sense", "buy low, sell high is kind of our mantra", "yeah, no, i\u2019ve never sold a share", "now, let me add the caveats", "when i have control", "so, the vast majority of the time, in our business, this would apply, which is we invest in a startup", "it either has an ipo or it gets acquired", "those are the two outcomes where it has a \u201cliquidity event\u201d", "and ipo, some point after the ipo, years later or at least 180 days later, a venture firm will distribute those shares to its investors", "so, i, as a general partner, would get shares", "so, i get shares of tesla", "i get shares of you name it", "now, what i choose to do with that is my own personal decision", "and from that point on, i have never sold a share", "now, what i do is give them to charity over time", "and some might argue that\u2019s kind of a sales decision, but not entirely, partially because it\u2019s not like i\u2019m trying to time the market", "i\u2019m betting on them in perpetuity", "and i\u2019ll give you another answer to why i do this in a moment", "but let me flush this one out a little bit more", "this has been wonderfully goal aligning with entrepreneurs because, if i\u2019m thinking when is the time to punch out, it\u2019s kind of a corrosive thought process", "when they\u2019re thinking, the ones i like, what does the next 20 years look like for this business, how can we make the most out of this next phase of growth because the best companies are like these sort of power laws of compounding potential", "would you want to be punching out", "and you wouldn\u2019t of facebook, at google 10 years ago", "god, that would have been really a bad mistake", "and actually, let me jump to the point no", "2", "so, the very first advice i got when i was entering this field was from someone who had spent their entire career at the rockefeller group, i forget which, the foundation or something", "his name is peter crisp, and i remember him vividly because i think my first week on the job, it was our first pitch to people who give us money", "and here, i met someone who has just come off a long career, sort of winding down slowly, off a long, illustrious career of investing in some of the best companies you can imagine", "and his two comments to me were, wow, first, i\u2019m super envious", "this young group of people", "starting your career right now, it was like you\u2019re going to love this", "i wish i was your age doing this again, this whole second wave", "so, here i am changing careers, as we mentioned earlier, not sure which career was made for me", "and then, to hear something like that", "and the second thing is, looking back over his whole career, he wished he had never sold anything", "and i had a similar reaction", "what do you mean", "he goes, well, i tried to time the market", "and if i had just held onto my apple shares, and who cares what would have happened to everything else", "the as if held value today, it would have trumped everything else", "i would be a much richer man", "i would have avoided all of that anxiety", "and that echoed in the back of my mind, to this day", "so, in my \u2013 and i won\u2019t share the specifics, but in my personal portfolio, there is a [inaudible] ", "there is a single company that\u2019s worth more than everything else combined because i have never sold a share", "and then, if i look at no", "2, i should go back and do the math", "no", "2 plus no", "3 probably, if i think about it long tail, exceeds everything else combined", "so, it\u2019s like a traditional power log", "and that is pretty amazing", "so, i just \u2013 when i made this decision, and also, around the same time, to give it all to charity that was another thing", "i created a living trust to give everything but a small, fixed dollar amount to the kids", "everything else is going to go to charity", "then, when you have major crashes, it\u2019s not like, i know this is going to sound weird, i don\u2019t stress that i just lost 90 percent of my net worth because that happened once", "it\u2019s like oh, the charity just lost 90 percent of its net worth", "and so, i was able to ride it through, and i came right back because i didn\u2019t panic and sell when i literally lost 90 percent of my net worth", "i recall seeing, i don\u2019t remember who it was, but one of the \u2013 and there aren\u2019t that many, as you know, but a tier venture capital firms looked at their return on something \u2013 their return to limited partners of the let\u2019s just call it 10 companies that had reached ipo", "and that they, subsequently, distributed", "and they compared that with the amount made by someone who would have invested the amount in the companies at first opportunity at ipo and ridden it out something like five years", "and they would have made just as much money in most of the cases", "yeah", "there was a fund called technology crossover ventures i think formed with that insight in mind that says, if you can pick some winners still private and have a judgment from seeing the track record, the passion of the entrepreneur, over a number of years, and then, load up the boat either just pre ipo or at ipo, you could put a large amount of capital work in that", "but the key was it was those prior years of exposure that really gave you confidence", "so, like my years with elon allowed me to look at him in a very different way than other entrepreneurs", "and if you just, literally, had no prior data, and he just walked in off the street, how would you really know", "so, you mentioned elon", "so, you\u2019ve spent time with jobs, elon, many other impressive folks", "but what are the commonalities you\u2019ve observed, biggest commonalities, biggest differences between those two", "sure", "well, let me start with differences because i think it\u2019s tempting to draw an analogy", "and i\u2019ve been tempted, trust me", "but i think it\u2019s really important to keep in mind, so i\u2019ll start there, there\u2019s pretty big differences", "jobs was a marketing centric individual with very weak engineering chops", "elon is more of a physicist turned engineer/computer scientist, basically, deep engineering chops, thinks of everything from first principles of what can be done from the physics and then, scales up to the product vision", "jobs, it\u2019s much more of almost zen buddhist approach to parsimonious design and the visceral agitation of imperfection in design space", "the famous calligraphy font thing and getting rid of all of the buttons from the phone", "there are all of these maniacal missions he had where, at no point, did he clearly lay out here\u2019s the business strategy", "you get rid of the buttons, everything moves to the cloud", "you have software services there", "you can iterate more quickly", "this is going to be an awesome business opportunity, if we can get rid of all of the buttons", "no, buttons are ugly", "get rid of them", "that\u2019s shit", "that design is shit, he would say", "but he wouldn\u2019t really give this oh, i get it, that\u2019s the master plan", "whereas elon is like master plan part 1, master plan part 2", "he lays it all out, and he\u2019s basically executing according to the master plan", "there\u2019s actually a really well thought out series of steps to get from here to colonizing mars", "a series of steps to get rid of the petrochemical economy, which is pretty amazing", "and it\u2019s all there for anyone to read", "that\u2019s like night and day difference", "now, similarities, simple", "when ceo of two companies, i think that\u2019s interesting structurally", "not too many people have the chutzpah to do that", "and i think, by the way, in both cases, it allows you to focus, interestingly, in a way that you couldn\u2019t otherwise", "oh, i see what you\u2019re saying", "i\u2019ve heard that sentence \u2013 a ceo of two companies", "each of them independently, ceos of two companies at a time", "you have tesla and spacex, you\u2019ve got pixar and either next or apple, depending on timeframe", "to be fair, jobs was really not quite the ceo at pixar, but he was by title", "in any case, what you can do though is avoid meetings", "imagine it\u2019s the company holiday party, and you just don\u2019t want to go", "no one is going to double guess \u2013 if you\u2019re a normal ceo at a normal company, and you avoid your own holiday party, what better things do you have to do", "but this is awesome", "you can, basically, avoid time wasting meetings", "and you have to delegate more", "and so, in both cases, it is an intriguing thought experiment that being ceo of more than one company has some interesting benefits for both companies", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i never thought of it that way", "yeah", "the similarity, i think, there is one area in design where the maniacal attention to detail, i described it as this visceral agitation almost painful to steve jobs to see things that were not right", "there\u2019s a bit of that in elon as well", "i interviewed him once about design, and it sounded so spookily similar in that regard", "but in a completely different wrapper, meaning you wouldn\u2019t really know or see it as a similar vector of \u2013 both think it\u2019s just easy", "and maybe it\u2019s the sign of brilliance that there are certain parts of this whole space that are intuitive", "and they do naturally", "and i wish i knew how to a) do it myself, and b) spot it in others", "so, everyone also wants to ask how can i raise my kid to be like elon, or how can i find entrepreneurs that are like him", "and if you think about it, just one element of that and how miraculous it is to be able to go into a number of industries, commercial banking, arguably pay pal, the aerospace industry with space x, the automotive sector, the energy competing with utilities with the solar city idea really left field", "now, it\u2019s part of tesla", "but when it started, it was really a left field sector", "it wasn\u2019t one industry", "that was like that\u2019s energy generation", "that\u2019s like competing with regulated facilities", "without any prior business experience in those sectors to become the dominant company in all of them, to have failed at none of them, to be the most important company in all of those fields is kind of mind boggling", "it is mind boggling", "and the thing that i look for in companies that say we\u2019ve got this mission, as i was mentioning, but we\u2019re going to get this through incremental steps and engaging with customers all along the way", "we\u2019re not just going to hunker down for 20 years and then, pop out with colonizing mars on the other end", "to actually paint the picture of how we get from here to there, that\u2019s even more miraculous in some ways", "it\u2019s like everyone can have a big dream", "like thousands of people could have the dreams that elon has", "almost none of them could paint a compelling picture of how to get there", "that\u2019s where the what\u2019s your 10 year vision, what\u2019s your 20 year vision comes into play", "so, elon has this mythical status for so many people", "just this kind of super who has got everything figured out.\u00a0 i found this article on business insider that was talking a little bit about your relationship with him", "and there are two things", "actually, two questions i want to ask", "so, the first is you called him the most risk immune person i\u2019ve ever met", "and then, i have a follow up to that", "but what does that \u2013 what\u2019s an example of him being risk immune", "and is it because he feels differently in the face of the same risk", "or is it because he defines risk differently or something like that", "yeah", "that\u2019s a great question because i think it\u2019s passed through the filter of the observer", "we perceive risk, incredible risk, in some of the things he\u2019s done", "i don\u2019t know that we have perfect vision on, and how could we, on really does he perceive the risk the same way we do as external observers", "and so, i think part of the answer, and his brother made a somewhat similar statement once, so i feel comfortable at least talking about this, not as if i\u2019m speaking out of school, that here\u2019s one way i could say it externally", "i\u2019ve never seen an entrepreneur go all in for his companies, and i say plural, as elon", "some entrepreneurs will take risks", "they\u2019ll quit a job", "they\u2019ll spend their entire life savings on some idea", "they\u2019ll do whatever", "the personal commitment, personal sacrifice", "i\u2019ve never seen anything like elon", "and i think this story came out, i was referring back to december 2008, and the darkest period for tesla", "yeah", "musk thought it would take $50 million to get his first trip to mars, and then, next sentence, he was $200 million in and had \u201cspent all of his money between that and tesla,\u201d and he went into personal debt by 2008", "exactly", "so, 2008, for those that might remember, the financial crisis was happening", "for context", "at that time, tesla had just gotten rid of a ceo", "elon had not been the ceo up until then", "and it was tough", "a large investment bank, one of the most prestigious, had just failed to do a fund raise", "this is where you hire them, pay them lots of money, go out and get us the money", "you expect it to come in, at the end of this process", "they\u2019re like, sorry, we have nothing for you", "and the company was rapidly running out of money", "in fact, it was heading towards december 2008, and they couldn\u2019t even make payroll", "so, elon wrote a check personally for $3 million, just so they could make the december christmas time payroll of the employees", "but january is going to be just as bad, and there\u2019s no money anywhere", "and, by the way, for context, there was no government program", "there was no daimler investment at this point", "it was just a company that had a roadster that was negative gross margin", "meaning every car you sell, you lose more money", "it was a surprise discovery how bad the proposition was, which is why the ceo was let go", "it was like oh, my god, contrary to our belief, we\u2019re actually losing money on every car", "and that\u2019s not easy to fix, by the way", "sell more cars does not solve this problem readily", "and you had your largest inside investor, this is a term of art in the venture community", "there\u2019s a lot of symbolism when your largest investor is or is not supportive of what you\u2019re doing", "it doesn\u2019t mean they actually have a lever they can pull to kill you, but the symbolism is bad because they\u2019re in the trenches with you", "and if they\u2019re refusing to write a check, that\u2019s a really hard fund raising environment", "and the largest investor was as hostile as i\u2019ve ever seen an investor", "they did not want elon as ceo", "they did not want anything to do with the company", "they wanted to pivot to a different business strategy that seemed a little too cozy that it would support one of their limited partners", "and it felt really icky", "and they were openly hostile", "and he was going through a divorce", "and space x rockets was blowing up, by the way", "and he spent every penny he had", "so, what does he do", "he borrowed $20 million, and he said okay, our lead investor is not here", "this large investment bank has failed", "i\u2019m going to invest the $40 million that\u2019s needed", "he didn\u2019t have $40 million", "he said i\u2019m going to invest the $40 million that\u2019s needed", "to hell with all of you", "here are the terms", "not to hell with \u2013 but i\u2019m doing it", "train is leaving the station", "and it flipped the zeitgeist of you all from fear to greed", "and this is \u2013 meaning everyone is thinking what does he see that i don\u2019t see", "and to be fair, there is a dynamic, which i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen, which is you can have a bunch of people around the table like we were, dfj was very enthusiastic and wanted to invest, but we can\u2019t do the full $40 million, and we need somebody to be a lead investor, and we\u2019ll do our full share", "we, actually, did more than our full share", "but somebody has got to step in front of this missing nut, when your largest insider won\u2019t \u2013 and you don\u2019t have any outside money", "someone has got to step up", "so, he stepped up and said i don\u2019t care", "i\u2019ll do the whole thing, if need be", "who is with me", "and we took as much as we could", "we brought our growth fund in for the first time", "and it is an easier decision to say will i write a check let\u2019s say for $2 million, let\u2019s say you\u2019re just one of the random investors there, as part of $40 million, knowing that at least there\u2019s $40 million", "at least we\u2019re going to get through this roadster cost problem and be able to turn some cards, if you will", "see does the government come through", "does the daimler relationship actually happen because there are verbal conversations going on", "we\u2019ll get resolution at least of those major things", "and so, there will be hope to get to the next phase of actually building the model s car, if all of that falls in our favor", "let\u2019s be part of it", "so, our $2 million check leverages the $40 million check", "i\u2019m just saying $2 million arbitrarily", "so, if all you can do is write $2 million checks, you would never just write a $2 million check", "that\u2019s a pier", "it\u2019s not a bridge to something", "and that\u2019s what a) elon was willing to do in december, all by himself", "and then, b) he was willing to do another one all by himself", "i have never seen anything like it", "so, he, in retrospect, was perfectly right", "everything went exactly according to plan", "this is going to change the world", "it\u2019s going to be an enormously valuable company", "this was an incredibly good investment to make, at the time, in retrospect", "at the time, it seemed like the riskiest thing i\u2019ve ever seen", "i\u2019ve never seen an entrepreneur fund their own company, first when no one else would; second, go net negative by $20 million", "unbelievable", "have you asked him what he was thinking at the time", "not directly", "i didn\u2019t want to \u2013 i liked it", "like this is great", "it just felt like the right thing because like i could see the fear going to greed", "by the way, in tough times, you sometimes also learn who is going to stand by you and who won\u2019t", "and so, that lead investor, and then, also, maybe i won\u2019t mention the names", "there\u2019s at least one board member who was like oh, my gosh, they showed their stripes", "and there\u2019s nothing like a crisis to know if you\u2019re in the trench with the right person", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "who your fair-weather friends are", "exactly", "so, to that point, it\u2019s mentioned in this piece that elon called you around the darkest times, so during some of these really tough periods", "and of course, keeping it whatever private should be private, but what does someone like elon \u2013 you\u2019ve interacted with a number of these people who have incredible capacity to do big things", "what does someone like that say to a friend during their dark times", "why do they call friends", "so, i\u2019m not going to relay any specifics, but i could try to get to the gist of the question", "i won\u2019t relay any specifics of the phone call", "and, to be fair, i don\u2019t even really remember the specifics because there have been so many calls over so many times", "so, with the caveat of \u2013 because if you look at the list of difficulties he was going through, any one of those would \u2013 would be soul crushing", "tim ferriss:\u00a0soul crushing", "it would completely paralyze and send millions of people into a downward spiral", "so, he has said some things because i don\u2019t want to speak out of school", "but there is something i can share that might be helpful", "he has spoken himself, and it was like eating glass", "that this was a really terrible time", "so, he\u2019s made some comments personally, and i\u2019ll just let him speak for what it felt like for him", "but i would say that what i\u2019ve observed in that crisis and other crises that we generalize is that he goes into a battle mode of focus that is really remarkable", "in this battle mode, it allows him i think to ignore distraction and to have a laser focus on what needs to get done", "so, it will sometimes be \u2013 i\u2019ll observe it as these sort of thoughtful, deep moments of like wow, you see it on his face", "and you want to give him space to think because i think there\u2019s like, for people, there could be times when you\u2019re generative and thoughtful and brain storming and thinking about all possibilities and the wonder of the world", "and there are other times when like you\u2019ve got to solve a problem and focus in", "and in those modes, he can avoid distraction like no one else i\u2019ve seen", "so, a lot of the smart ceos and entrepreneurs i\u2019ve worked with are some of them share attributes that i have in spades, which is i\u2019m interested in many things", "i\u2019m easily distracted by something", "and sometimes, i\u2019d rather avoid the tough crisis and thinking about it, when there\u2019s something more fun to spend time on", "and so, i\u2019m almost the opposite of this, just to give credit to how valuable this is", "when, let\u2019s say, tesla has faced various manufacturing challenges, these sort of production hell times that he\u2019s described, he physically sets up his office on the production floor in a very visible area with no walls, so everyone can see that he\u2019s there through the weekend", "the vice presidents see that, and that ripples out", "when he\u2019s calling a supplier, let\u2019s say he was off because of problems, and he\u2019s like i\u2019m here in the factory, where are you", "why aren\u2019t you here solving this for us", "it has a lot of impact", "that personal attention to, right now, everything else needs to be gone", "i have to solve this problem", "i witnessed this, for example, in a more subtle way more recently when i was setting up or trying to set up rather a very interesting phone call between the mars exploration program for nasa", "craig vander who is a pioneer in synthetic biology and gene sequencing and gene synthesis", "and i wanted to just get elon on a half hour call because the sort of idea had occurred amongst us that we could do a much cheaper mars return mission, in other words, if there\u2019s any life on mars, either archaic or currently living, the best way to explore it would be not to send it back from mars, which is very difficult, but send a gene sequencer to mars, sequence it locally, beam the data back, and create the living organism on earth", "that actually is doable", "and i thought elon should certainly be interested in this because the next phase of mars exploration, terraforming, finding out what organisms do live on mars or not, if they mutate on mars and actually start thriving, send the data back, create a version on earth to study it here, and more rapidly terraform mars", "he\u2019s like that\u2019s great", "he said i can\u2019t take that \u2013 only a half hour phone call", "one day, that will be important", "right now, i\u2019ve got to get [inaudible] to fly or there won\u2019t be that need for me to do that", "so, i\u2019m like i would love this half hour phone call amongst the three of them", "he\u2019s like that can wait a few years, and it can", "and that remarkable ability to push aside all of these interesting things when there is i\u2019ve got to get xyz to ship or fix the problem", "and so, fixing the gross margin problem back in 2008, getting a ceo, which turned out to be himself, in place, and solving all of the myriad of problems that were in place was battle mode", "and he would also lean on confidants and friends", "so, to be fair, there were others like antonio gracias and others who really rolled up their sleeves, got on the factory floor \u2013 he\u2019s a close friend", "yeah", "he\u2019s amazing", "so, folks like that really come and prove that they\u2019re some of the most valuable investors out there", "antonio is happy to fight to support his friends, too", "exactly", "i\u2019ll just say it", "he\u2019s my favorite investor that i ever met in my entire life", "no kidding", "we\u2019ll catch up more over a bottle of wine about this", "but antonio and i were in the henry crown fellowship program together at the aspen institute", "so, we\u2019ve had a chance to spend a lot of time together", "great guy, absolutely great guy", "so, two things come to mind", "the first is, and i\u2019m sure i\u2019m going to butcher this, but it\u2019s a quote attributed to steve jobs", "i feel like there are a lot of misattributed quotes", "i\u2019m pretty sure this is accurate", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s an abe lincoln situation on the internet", "but that innovation is saying no to a thousand things", "that the \u2013 i haven\u2019t heard that", "in any case, the other was \u2013 he\u2019s also, by the way \u2013 jobs was very proud of, when asked what his greatest contribution to the world, his greatest invention, his greatest thing, on his death bed, it was apple, the organization", "and it was really the process learning coming back to something i was starting to talk about earlier", "he was focused on the physical space design, keeping the engineers and the marketing people, thinking about where the bathrooms are at pixar, so you have to walk by certain areas to get to them", "he was maniacal about architecting the way people communicate, kicking people out of meetings, if they\u2019re too big", "so, he had an intuitive sense about team size long before i did", "if the people are over a certain weight class", "no, no, no", "tim ferriss:\u00a0no, i\u2019m kidding", "you don\u2019t want more than seven people on anything productive", "no development team", "actually, five is the ideal number", "five plus or minus two", "boards of directors, development teams, creative groups", "that\u2019s one of the secret advantages of small companies is they have less people", "and they get shit done", "when it\u2019s a big company that has hundreds of people and [inaudible] layers of management, they\u2019ve lost the small team dynamic", "so, i always like to ask about, and i asked about it with elon, some of the tougher times or challenges because it\u2019s easy, i think, and i explore this with lots of \u2013 everybody who is on the show, i try to", "i ask them about how they try to deal with overwhelm, or if they feel scattered, what do they do", "and we talked a little bit about elon", "i\u2019d love to ask you because you recently had an experience that a lot of people have, in the sense that i and many others get their turn as kind of the punching bag", "if you\u2019re public facing, you\u2019re going to run into things", "and you had an experience recently that i\u2019d love for you to describe, if you\u2019re open to it", "and then, i have some follow up questions just about how you then reacted to it", "self talk and things like that", "so, maybe, if i could just leave it open", "yeah", "maybe it\u2019s an elephant in the room", "but in the last couple of months, i have faced the most surreal experience of my career, which is 23 years of venture capital and many before that, all positive press experiences", "and then, i faced a bizarre almost autocatalytic, self-generating theme that i hosted a sex party with my fianc\u00e9 in silicon valley", "and, at first, i laughed", "i thought this was hilarious", "an ex-geek growing up my whole life with glasses and braces and what have, the notion \u2013 i mean, my first date was in college", "and i really thought that was hilarious at first", "and then, it got a little more serious", "and i\u2019m like wait, this is ridiculous", "and the thing that\u2019s even more \u2013 it derived from a book that came out in february where there\u2019s no such claim that we hosted a sex party, but it\u2019s in a chapter about sex parties that other people had", "and we just happened to be the only party that anyone mentioned by name", "and then, if i try to put a simplistic spin on this or try to make sense of it, it looks like people just didn\u2019t read the chapter very carefully, and they made blog posts or other very sort of nonprofessional postings online that oh, my gosh, the sex party was at steve\u2019s house", "and i\u2019m like what", "not only did the book not say that, it wasn\u2019t true", "and by the way, there are 150 people that attended this thing that know it\u2019s not true", "and 10 of them go publicly on \u2013 which is kind of a risky thing to do and saying i was at this party, and there was no sex", "tim ferriss:\u00a0including elon", "and musk was like this is irresponsible journalism or something to that effect", "and he condemned the writer", "and it\u2019s kind of bizarre because i know this author", "i\u2019ve been on her bloomberg television program many times", "she knows my email", "she knows my cell phone", "she never called me for a fact check, which i didn\u2019t realized in book publishing today, in what\u2019s ostensibly a nonfiction category that the publishers do no fact checking", "that\u2019s just a fact now", "it\u2019s transformed from decades ago", "and they leave it up to the writer", "and the writer just didn\u2019t even try to see if it was true", "and more disturbingly would retweet, even though she never said we had a sex party, she would retweet other people who did", "so, some other publication in europe would say the orgy", "so, it starts to grow", "the orgy at our house", "and she retweets it", "and i\u2019m like, really", "you know this isn\u2019t true, and i know she knows it isn\u2019t true", "but she keeps retweeting it because it sells more books", "and i know executives, for example, who have been pressured by their pr people to say positive things about the book because of her ongoing role as a bloomberg reporter", "she had this weird conflict of interest when you want to sell books, and salacious stories sell, to propagate something that\u2019s not true, even if you didn\u2019t say it yourself", "and then, turn around and use your leverage and your bully pulpit on twitter and elsewhere to gain support for your book because you know people want to continue working with you", "and you\u2019re going to be \u2013 you\u2019re the journalist of record in the tech industry at one of the biggest news organizations", "it\u2019s kind of unfair", "so, it feels really horrible", "yeah", "i was going to ask you, how did it feel, and what was your self talk, maybe in the short term", "and then, i ask a lot of people about self talk, which i\u2019m fascinated by", "so, the day of, let\u2019s just say, when it ceases to be funny, and then, maybe, i don\u2019t know, i\u2019m making this up in terms of timeline, but a few days later, when you\u2019ve had a chance to maybe gather your thoughts a bit", "yeah", "so, despite the initial burst, almost like a defensive a-ha this is funny, and then, when i really allowed it to sink in, it probably took some number of hours", "i\u2019m like wait a minute, for example, there\u2019s 150 \u2013 probably more, in total, but 150 that really knew there was nothing there, and they were there the whole time", "they had to explain to their spouses and others like no, i really wasn\u2019t at a sex party", "it\u2019s really embarrassing", "those poor people totally innocent", "anyway, and, again, not to condemn a sex party", "i\u2019ve never been invited to one", "i\u2019ve never held one", "i don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a terrible thing, but let\u2019s just say i haven\u2019t been to one, i don\u2019t want to be accused of one", "just to inject some levity real quickly, so i just moved to san francisco, this was a long time ago, and one of my neighbors said, \u201cwelcome to the neighborhood", "you should come over saturday", "we\u2019re having a party.\u201d and i was like, \u201csure, no problem.\u201d so, i ended up having a late dinner", "and i was like is it too late", "no, it\u2019s not too late", "come on over", "so, i walk in, and i\u2019m like what is happening here", "people in various states of undress and just in time to realize oh, my god, i\u2019m actually at a sex party", "there was food served", "but i\u2019m like fully clothed with a beanie and a hoodie on", "and then, they go everybody sit down", "we\u2019re going to do a round of introductions", "and so, i sit down, and i\u2019m like how do i get out of this because there are like 40 or 50 people there", "and i did manage to scurry out and then say to my neighbor, i won\u2019t name by name, but i was just like, please, in the future let me know", "give me a heads up", "and i have nothing against it, but it\u2019s like let me know what\u2019s going on", "in any case, it\u2019s like you\u2019re in the bay area, so it\u2019s like \u2013 i\u2019m sure these things happen, i just literally have never been invited to one", "it\u2019s not my thing", "so, i don\u2019t want to sound too preachy, but it\u2019s just not my thing", "and it does feel weird to have a room full of tech executives and some of our closest business colleagues, scores of them aligned in this indirect way", "so, the way i felt though is i felt really betrayed", "and it wasn\u2019t just the single journalist that i\u2019ve highlighted like wow, what happened to professional journalistic ethics", "like just fact checking and caring about the truth", "that\u2019s one branch of disappointment", "the other was a little more invisible", "i\u2019ll keep this anonymous", "but there were a number of people i noticed who would immediately lend support to this idea online", "like either simple things like retweeting something without checking with me", "people who ostensibly know me", "that was really disappointing", "so, i felt betrayed by luckily only a handful", "a remarkably small number of people who just \u2013 and, frankly, they were some of my least well known contacts, so these aren\u2019t close personal friends.\u00a0 they\u2019re like let\u2019s say other venture capitalists, just as a category", "on the other side, i was blown away by the outpouring of support by people who do know me", "so, a couple of co-workers, of ex-employees that i used to work with came out with blog posts", "and in every case, it was after they published that i even knew they were putting something together coming in my defense", "and like female entrepreneurs of all types were like no, it was anything but this happened at this event", "and i\u2019ll be eternally grateful for when times are really tough, you find out a bit more about people\u2019s character, and you find out who is really someone who knows you because someone who knows me knows this is not true", "and what\u2019s weird is that i thought it would be obvious to a larger set, but at least the ones that really know me, they don\u2019t even need to ask about it", "oh, my god, dude, what\u2019s going on", "this is crazy", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what prevented you \u2013 you had the outpouring of support", "you also had a few people show their true colors", "some people, when they get hit with something like that, anything \u2013 i mean, i\u2019ve had periods where it\u2019s like i remember this kind of hit piece came out on me", "\u00a0and i\u2019m not saying these are the same thing, but a hit piece came out on me, and it came out on my birthday, at one point, where i have this annual gathering of my closest friends", "and it was through a credible, a very well-known publication that had not only \u2013 they had contacted me for fact checking via phone", "i had corrected a bunch of misquotes, and then, they ran it as is without making any of the changes", "and it really bummed me out", "i was considering not doing any interviews ever in the future", "maybe i\u2019ll have to make a number of changes to my life, so that i\u2019m not exposed", "and i think that there are certain ways\u00a0 you can mitigate like always doing fact checking, email responses, as opposed to \u2013 right", "because then, they can\u2019t deny you did it", "you always direct it to email", "there are a number of different ways that you can risk mitigate there", "but was there anything that you said to yourself or that other people said to you that was particularly helpful, at the time", "let me think about that for a second", "well, the thing that jumps to mind is how supportive my fianc\u00e9, genevieve, was throughout this", "she\u2019s a fighter", "and she was at my side throughout", "in some ways, it was incredible", "and i\u2019m incredibly thankful for her support throughout this", "at the beginning of what you were saying, the part that was going through my mind, as you were asking the questions, is that one of the toughest things, and it relates to advice other people gave me, was the advice to not say anything", "the advice to be just mum", "i got advice from people who focus on pr", "i got advice from people who have been through similar situations or worse", "have been accused of crazy things or crimes, falsely accused of crimes, which, luckily, i\u2019ve never been accused of", "and in every single case, with zero crack of there\u2019s another side to this point of view, it\u2019s like you say nothing", "you do not point out the obvious flaws in these false accusations", "\u00a0and the research supporting this is disturbing but true that anything you say, even definitively proving your innocence, will only worsen people\u2019s perception of you at large", "just the mere recanting or resurfacing of that topic to then say it has been decidedly proven false will make people think worse of you on average", "now, from the media perspective", "so, in private conversations, that is not the case", "and i\u2019ve asked psychologists about this", "they\u2019re like no, all of the studies, real clinical/science driven studies show that you do not want to say anything, even to prove your own innocence", "so, that\u2019s horrible", "it\u2019s like that\u2019s where you\u2019re torn up with all of the virtual conversations you\u2019d like to have with the people who have done you wrong, with the media", "it\u2019s because you know you can set the record straight", "it\u2019s like i wrote pages of stuff that i never used", "let\u2019s just set the record straight", "and my mind played, for months, it would play through here\u2019s what i would say that would just either a) clear it all up, or b) get back at the person who i know is being dishonest to prove they\u2019re being dishonest", "\u00a0say like fess up", "how about you won this one", "so, that is the most difficult", "i really had a hard time with that because, in every other aspect of my life, i don\u2019t have to do that", "you can speak openly about like i disagree with you", "well, that didn\u2019t really happen", "or that\u2019s a science based fact or something", "as an ex-scientist, i hate that", "and so, it seems like this \u2013 you were able to withstand the flack very well", "if you think back on it could be at any point in your life, but has there ever been a particularly difficult period for you that you\u2019ve \u2013 no", "no", "i mean, my whole high school", "but that was a long, retroactive series of pain of just feeling insecure and like i was a late bloomer", "i can tell you about tough times, but there wasn\u2019t like a shock to the system", "i mean, i was deeply hurt when my dad died", "that was tough", "but it was something that\u2019s life", "it was a natural cause", "that qualifies, too", "but it was tough, yeah", "remorse and \u2013 so, yeah, i\u2019ve gone through some through things, but nothing that was quite like this, which is wow, that really \u2013 someone did me wrong", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, for sure", "i\u2019ve been betrayed as opposed to life has its cycles, and i can feel sad about the passing of a dear loved one", "but it\u2019s a different category, i think", "yeah", "totally different categories", "but i\u2019m interested still in the coping mechanisms or the thinking that goes with this", "so, when your dad died, and i\u2019m sorry for your loss, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine, but what was most helpful during the period of grieving or recovering from that", "it wasn\u2019t \u2013 i didn\u2019t have a play book of what to do", "and what seemed most natural, and it may have been a habit of mine, was to focus on my\u00a0 mom and helping her who survived him, who was there at his side when he passed of a heart attack", "\u00a0it\u2019s just one of those things that we\u2019re like why are you trying to revive him, you\u2019re trying to call 9-1-1", "my heart went out so much to her and how her situation was worse than mine, in a way, that that consumed almost all of my thoughts for some period of time dealing with i\u2019m the only child in that family, dealing with what needs to be dealt with", "i went into sort of almost non emotional operations mode", "and it\u00a0 may have been sometime late that night or the next day that i finally allowed myself to cry and really face what i had lost", "part of what gave me incredible solace is perhaps some wisdom i could pass on to others who worry about parents who go", "and i know tim urban and others have written some wonderful pieces about thinking about your parents, when you\u2019re our parents\u2019 generation, like how many days to you have left with them", "yeah", "the tail end", "everybody should read it", "and it was recommended to me, just as a quick side note, by matt mullenweg, a mutual friend, wonderful person who also lost his father not too long ago", "and he recommended it to me before it happened", "\u00a0exactly", "so, maybe the thing that i took solace in, and i\u2019ll share it for others, is it\u2019s not what you do in the weeks before someone passes that really defines your relationship", "it\u2019s what you\u2019ve done over your life", "and so, i had been going to the ted conference", "i brought him with me", "it was one of the greatest joys of his life for years prior", "the fact that we had all of those weeks together, sort of these one on one times, of intellectual pursuits", "and a way almost to welcome him into my world, like take dad to work day, in a sense, in this sort of virtual world of ideas and science, technology", "when he went through a pancreatic surgery procedure, and just around thanksgiving, and he came out of it", "and i was told by the nurse who first saw him, when he came out of it was that \u2013 because there was a chance he wouldn\u2019t make it even through the procedure", "he said, \u201coh, i get to go to ted again.\u201d it was like oh, my god", "that\u2019s amazing", "so, hearing that, and then, he had complications a few weeks later that he passed from", "but just knowing how much that meant to him and how much time i did get to spend with him purposely was it really took the edge off", "if we were estranged, if i was at odds with him, then, i\u2019d really, i think, be torn up with guilt of having not come to closure", "and we had nothing", "he\u2019s my hero", "i\u2019ve only had positive thoughts about him throughout my life, so that made it easier, ironically, to lose the guy that i had the best relationship with", "yeah", "this is, as you said, part of the cycle", "i\u2019m certainly not looking forward to it", "people ask me what do you fear or what are you afraid of", "and there are certainly things", "not as many as one might expect", "i mean, i don\u2019t want to be eaten by sharks or anything", "but i don\u2019t spend a lot of time dwelling on the fear of that happening", "statistically unlikely", "but watching my parents get older and, ultimately, pass away is something that i think qualifies definitely as something that occupies my mind", "and i owe matt a huge debt of gratitude because he led me to the tail end", "i read the tail end, and that led me a number of years ago to start taking extended trips with my parents twice a year", "\u00a0so, at six month intervals, we have not just a trip, which is usually let\u2019s just call it two to three weeks where i usually take them somewhere they haven\u2019t been, but also, the entire period in between during which we can look forward to the trip and plan the trip and talk about the trip", "and that anticipation, i feel like, is sort of 70 or 80 percent of the enjoyment of it", "so, i owe matt a huge thank you", "and he recommended a book to me i haven\u2019t yet read, but i\u2019m hoping to soon, which i believe is on grief and grieving", "and he\u2019s been on the podcast", "people look up his last name and grief and grieving, i\u2019m sure the correct title, if that isn\u2019t it, will pop up", "but he recommended that everyone read it, even before passing of loves ones", "so, we talked about matt mullenweg", "i pinged him to ask him what subjects or questions might be interesting to explore", "and one of them was parenting", "so, it\u2019s a good segue", "how do you think about parenting or maybe doing it differently is too awkward a question to answer", "\u00a0but what are some of the things that you think are important in parenting", "well, we don\u2019t really get manuals on how to do it", "people, young parents, first time parents are just sort of thrust into it", "and you find your own way", "the only thing i did to prepare for being a parent was to read scientists in the crib by alison gopnik", "it\u2019s not a parenting book", "it\u2019s, basically, about the neuroscience of infants through 2 and 3 years old that made it fascinating to study, literally, this incredible creature when they were pre-verbal", "it sort of created a bond that some dads lack, i think, when they don\u2019t have that physical connection in nursing or what have you that a mom might have", "and yet, to marvel at this creation that is in front of you", "things like how they pick up language, how the [inaudible] system develops", "i\u2019m going down a strange rat hole here, but it gave me strange experiments to run like pushing the bassinet on the first day of life under a light overhead that was an l shape, and the baby\u2019s eyes would open immediately every time it went under there because you could actually see it through the closed eye", "\u00a0and any edge detection just fires up the brain", "so, it\u2019s like if you have visitors, watch this, pop the eyes open", "and then, during [inaudible] development, meaning learning language, practicing b and p sounds because it\u2019s like sort of \u2013 we take it for granted, but we learn how to speak by watching others like what are you doing with your lips to make that sound", "so, it made young childhood development easy", "then, i got into my groove, which is like my power ally, which is playing with kids, getting down at their level, whether it\u2019s legos or blocks or whatever and just exploration and fun", "so, what i loved about being a parent, in the early years, was an excuse to rediscover [inaudible] or just legos, in general, and then, [inaudible], which got so much better", "the toys have gotten so much better with drones and everything", "so, when the kids are older, basically, playing with kids, to me, is super invigorating", "and metaphorically, i think a lot of engineers, scientists, and people close to that field like even venture capitalists would do well to try to be creative like a child", "\u00a0to engage like a child does with the world in that childlike wonder", "yeah", "not to interrupt, but this brings to mind, and just for long time listeners, the reason that i\u2019m not going to ask a lot of my rapid fire questions that i normally do is because steve, you were kind enough to answer a good number of them in my last book, tribe of mentors", "but in that, i asked you what you would put on a billboard, and you said celebrate the childlike mind", "yeah", "i mean, i didn\u2019t want to interrupt the discussion on parenting, but \u2013 right", "it\u2019s almost like a mantra that came out of parenting, which is i could see how \u2013 and this is something, by the way, that harkens back, indirectly, to this book, scientists in the crib, that babies are like scientists", "they form conjectures and hypotheses", "they test the world", "they\u2019re putting things in their mouth", "they\u2019re playing with everything", "sometimes, it frustrates the parent", "but when you see them as scientists doing experiments and learning how the world works from a sort of boot up phase, it\u2019s metaphorical for what we lose often times after many years of traditional education", "they kind of beat the creativity out of you", "and i think the best engineers and the best scientists have that kind of childlike mind", "you can see it in the writings of feinman and even einstein and newton and others", "newton, i think, once famously said, \u201ci felt like nothing but a child playing on the seashore.\u201d that there\u2019s something deeply resonant about seeing the connectivity in things as a child would and avoiding the strictures and mental ruts that academic disciplines foster and job tracks \u2013 think about discipline, track, those are both two things i don\u2019t like", "i\u2019d rather have less discipline and less tracks", "i\u2019d rather be exploratory and creative", "and so, i found children to be a wonderful opportunity", "and it\u2019s such a win/win", "you\u2019re connecting with them", "you\u2019re mindful", "you\u2019re present", "and that later rolls into reading with them", "i spent a lot of time, and try to, whenever i\u2019m with them, do what they like to do", "engage with them in the kinds of toys and things that they like, and then, push that a little further with all kinds of, how should i put it, tech infused adjuncts to what they might normally be playing with", "\u00a0tim ferriss:\u00a0we probably don\u2019t have time to go into it right now, in this conversation, but where can people learn about your rockets, your rocket building", "so, i did a short ted talk on the joys of rocketry, i think it was called the joys of rocketry", "so, ever since my son turned 3, we started launching model rockets", "in the story, there was i just went to a local toy store back when they had them, a physical place, and saw these rocket kits ready to fly", "and i\u2019m like, wow, i sort of remember rockets when i was little", "i wasn\u2019t that into them", "i built a couple", "and so, we did this", "and to make a long story short, i found a mentor that could teach me like you could get really bigger engines and bigger rockets to the present day", "i\u2019ve probably launched thousands of rockets", "i 3d print these designs", "my son and i have been working on this", "we go out to the black rock desert every year and launch really big things going well past super sonic speeds, routinely", "launching large rockets, rockets he could fit inside as a hobby", "\u00a0that\u2019s probably where i first met planet labs was out in the desert launching rockets, as an aside", "so, occasionally, good business comes out of it, too", "but most of all, it\u2019s this incredible hobby of making science real.\u00a0 like when something fails to launch or explodes on the pad or comes back in because the parachute didn\u2019t deploy properly, it is just viscerally exciting", "i can\u2019t really put my finger on why it\u2019s not universally exciting", "to me, it just feels like something everyone should do a little bit of", "so, talking about making science real, there were a few tidbits that i pulled from one of your indices on various talks", "and they were just seemed like fantastic, attention grabbing headlines, at the very least", "not intended to be that, but i\u2019d be interested in hearing the answer or just a little bit of elaboration on this", "one was drones and how to eliminate the tsa", "so, what\u2019s the shortish, it doesn\u2019t have to be super short, but explanation of what that means", "sure", "and so, the drones thing is peripheral", "but how to eliminate the tsa is an epiphany i had back i think it was around 2005 or maybe earlier, maybe 2003", "post 9/11, tsa is in full effect doing all kinds of crazy things", "i think they just implemented the shoe thing for the first time", "and i\u2019m at this sort of brain storming effort with them where they gave us the challenge how can we rapidly erratically streamline airport security operations to get on the plane sooner", "and this was, at the time, looking at 18 years", "i don\u2019t know why 18 years", "maybe it was 2002, and this would be 2020", "maybe it was 2002", "and so, i came to that", "i think i was the only tech guy there", "and i\u2019m thinking 18 years, that\u2019s a long time to predict things", "we\u2019d invested, by the way, in some airport security technology stuff, but i didn\u2019t really talk about any of that", "i was like 18 years, that\u2019s going to be perhaps 18 doublings of moore\u2019s law, which would be 256,000 x compute power", "\u00a0what might someone do then that they couldn\u2019t do now", "well, autonomous flight", "but it was long before autonomous driving or autonomous flight or drones was a thing", "those words didn\u2019t exist, at least not in the vernacular of products", "and i said there\u2019s no question that we could have autonomous flight by then, 18 years in the future, by the year 2020, autonomous planes because already can today, by the way", "air bus and boeing, every one of those planes can land better than the pilot could and take off", "everything but taxiing is easy compared to autonomous driving", "in any case, no one else was on that page", "and i said do you realize what would happen if there\u2019s no cockpit", "you can make that a really nice first class lounge", "the plane can\u2019t be used as a weapon", "so, why have any security gateway", "so, what you could do instead is go in with some biometrics where you know who is on the plane", "have video surveillance on the plane as the tradeoff", "and bring whatever weapon you want on the plane", "this would be a really bad place to go kill 200 people because you\u2019re going to get caught", "if you\u2019re a terrorist cell, you\u2019re going to get caught", "if you can\u2019t use it as a terrorist weapon, then, why have the tsa at all", "\u00a0and then, there was the wait, will it really work", "and it will if you have autonomous flight, and we should be doing it today with today\u2019s technology, no doubt about it", "and you could telematically operate at each airport for the taxi part, if that\u2019s really so hard", "but i don\u2019t think that\u2019s that hard", "and then, you get to go a step further and say what about bombs, maybe the plane falls out of the sky", "your luggage could fly separately in an autonomous thing from the plane itself", "you\u2019d have a smaller luggage only plane for the actual cargo part", "you could have smaller planes", "the whole design space starts to change, in terms of what the optimal design is, if you\u2019re not amortizing a pilot anymore in terms of that operational cost", "and you could have multiple flights where there was a single one before, now there\u2019s even less people per plane and more flexibility in your roots", "all of this unpacks", "and i asked them have you even calculated the economic impact of the shoe policy", "and they didn\u2019t know what i meant", "i was like you could just take how much time did that just add to the cue of the average traveler times the average salary of the average american and just the economic dead weight loss", "and part of what i tried to show them is that the immune response of a system is often worse and what kills you not the pathogen", "\u00a0so, it\u2019s often our own immune system that kills us, literally, as the method of death", "and i said how long until someone puts a battery on fire", "are you going to keep the laptops and cell phones off of the plane", "do you realize the economic impact of that", "and they didn\u2019t want to hear it", "and i\u2019m glad that hasn\u2019t happened quite yet", "but i\u2019m like that\u2019s what the terrorist cell should be doing to cause the most harm", "have one yahoo make a half assed attempt to light a battery on fire on a plane, and now, look what it would do", "i was in a flight from i want to say it was \u2013 i mean, i was on a far flung place, but i think it was uzbekistan to istanbul or istanbul to london", "it was one of the two, and we actually had to surrender all of our laptops", "and it created the amount of confusion and congestion and craziness that that created was just unbelievable", "yeah", "so, the end of the tsa", "that\u2019s right", "wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how do you budget, as a technology investor, for regulatory or political opposition from incumbents", "and you could look at many different examples of this, whether it\u2019s lobbyists or extremely powerful unions of various types that would be strongly, strongly, strongly incentivized to not allow something like the tsa to go", "yeah", "no, with pilot unions", "some people would point out the usual well, you\u2019ve got a bit of an issue here", "so, in the past, in the \u201890s especially, when the internet was like you could just do internet for a while, and that was fine, we had the mantra to never invest in a regulated sector", "and still, to this day, i try not to invest in anything that requires any law to get passed in order to be in business", "and the one exception is we went all in on autonomous driving when the product is currently illegal, but we know it\u2019s going to become legal", "fully level 5 autonomous driving", "with that exception, recently, and the old school, we\u2019d not only try to avoid regulatory environments, we try to avoid if you had to deal with, in any way, as a customer, partner, with utilities or the government or in any of that sector", "but i think, frankly, that left a lot of large sectors just \u2013 a lot of entrepreneurs were avoiding them like the plague", "so, when elon opened our eyes and says you can actually take on what might be perceived to be the most non market, if you will, or non-market factors, not like the best product doesn\u2019t necessarily win in the ultra-industrial complex", "if you could take that on head on and just win with a better product", "and similarly, going up against the regulated utilities with solar city, so to distribute a solar solution", "and yes, they\u2019re fighting with every dirty trick you can imagine", "they\u2019re trying every angle", "but, sometimes, there\u2019s just such a compelling advantage because there\u2019s been no new interest for 25 years", "they haven\u2019t faced a competitive threat in their institutional lifetime, they really don\u2019t know how to behave in response", "so, you have, on one hand, yes, they\u2019ll try to do dastardly things", "and i don\u2019t know what to say other than you just kind of hope that enough of normal democracy will flourish that you can overcome that and not have critical wounds", "\u00a0we\u2019ll see", "but on the other side, you don\u2019t usually \u2013 when i was in software investing, as a primary focus, you don\u2019t usually find opportunities to make 100 fold or 1,000 fold cost advantage in a product", "but you do, in some of these areas, because they literally have faced no competitive threat for so long, they don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s like to compete", "take like the aerospace industry", "there\u2019s a number of chinese ministers who, early on, when space x gave the pricing for the falcon 9, they said those prices are not real", "we could not compete at those price points, even if we had all western technology", "it\u2019s game over", "and other us competitors said we, basically, have to shut down our product lines", "imagine if some competitive oracle or microsoft said we\u2019re going to come out with something", "and you\u2019re like yeah, you\u2019re right, we better stop selling windows", "or we\u2019re just going to not do databases anymore because that\u2019s better", "no company responds with we\u2019re shutting down our entire product line", "and we were the monopolist prior", "we were the thing", "\u00a0and the only caveat is they say that we\u2019re shutting down our product lines", "but government, you\u2019ve got to have another company", "so, give us $4 billion, we\u2019ll build a better one", "we can do it", "we can built it", "get us $4 billion", "we forgot to innovate for 25 years, but now, give us a pile of money, and we\u2019ll start", "it\u2019s wild", "i\u2019ve never seen anything like it", "so, one thing that we chatted a little bit about before recording that i wanted to ask you about is printed organs and synthetic meat", "hopefully not in the same dish", "hopefully not in the same dish, although you never know", "it could be the whole nose to tail", "but, in this case, you would have to, i suppose, imagine the exterior would be a figment of your imagination in the case of synthetic meat", "but can you \u2013 where are things, currently, with synthetic meat, and where will they be in the relatively near term", "and why is it important, for that matter", "i think that\u2019s a great question", "[inaudible]", "i think it\u2019s one of the major tech themes or factors that will affect a lot of people\u2019s lives over the next 10 to 20 years", "\u00a0and not everyone is fully aware of it yet", "and it\u2019s an inevitability", "so, back when we were talking about these inevitable futures like all cars will be electric, all vehicles will be autonomous", "this is one of those", "we will not slaughter animals to get meat", "and the question is is that 50 years out", "is that 500 years out", "but just like we won\u2019t burn oil and gas 500 years out, there\u2019s no way we would do that 500 years out, especially not in small, internal combustion engines that we won\u2019t slaughter a cow to get a steak", "and so, the insight occurs when you realize, first, it\u2019s a much cheaper and efficient way to grow the product you need without the whole cow", "the hide", "you don\u2019t need the methane production", "you don\u2019t need all of the inefficiency that was an artifact of biological evolution", "you don\u2019t need the land use, the water use, the energy use", "you can cut all of that somewhere between 10 and 100 x, all of those factors, which, by the way, for the listeners that don\u2019t know this, about one-third of all useable land on earth goes to meat production", "so, this is the grain that gets fed to cows and pigs and chickens", "and the land that those animals live on", "so, one-third of all useable land", "it\u2019s astounding", "it\u2019s one of the biggest water problems, the biggest methane gas, which is one of the most serious greenhouse gas problems", "it\u2019s sort of on par with the whole petrochemical economy", "or on the other hand, if you can say i will get rid of oil and gas forever, or i\u2019ll get rid of meat product, you\u2019d be better getting rid of meat production, in the short term, in terms of green house gases and the environment", "so, pretty big deal", "so, why is this possible", "there are two major branches of companies that are trying to solve this", "one branch is to replace meat with something that\u2019s not meat", "and i applaud those efforts", "it\u2019s a little bit more of an engineering challenge to get it past the consumer", "and each product has its own engineer", "each and every product is challenging", "you make the duck taste like duck, make the chicken taste like chicken", "and have it not just be like sausages and hot dogs but actually fillet, if you want to take on the whole corner of the market", "so, that will make a meaningful impact and be important", "it\u2019s just going to be slow moving because of how hard it is to do each product and to make it anything passable is challenging", "extremely hard", "i\u2019ve tried a lot of those products", "people have been trying every which way to do a veggie burger", "there are big breakthroughs recently by using heme and plant based heme", "just for those of you who are impossible, that means you get a veggie burger that bleeds, basically", "exactly", "they found a root of soy plant that has a molecular cage that holds an iron atom in the center that\u2019s called a porphyrin that\u2019s the same molecule kind of structures that we have in hemoglobin that makes your blood red, that makes it turn color when it gets out of your body, that makes your steak turn red, that makes it taste the way it does, that makes it barbeque the way it does, the way it browns", "all of those things you put in a plant", "you can also put it, by the way, you can make chicken a red meat", "it\u2019s kind of fun", "but, anyway, that\u2019s the plant based approach", "a lot of engineering, a lot of effort, a lot of money per product", "the other [inaudible] we invested in called memphis meats and others like that says let\u2019s just make steak", "let\u2019s make chicken", "let\u2019s make any of these products in like not just a substitute, make the exact same thing, but don\u2019t grow it in a cow", "so, it\u2019s more of changing the manufacturing method, quite simply", "do you have the cow making the steak, or do you have it in a lab", "\u00a0how do you make it in the lab", "well, the team came from cardiology and other medical backgrounds", "they have people that have done work in stem cell biology, and people that have worked in the whole synthetic biology area", "and it\u2019s pretty straight forward to grow cells", "you take stem cells", "you can induce them to be [inaudible] or induce them to be immortal, basically, and you can just grow an infinite number of these cells that could become anything", "they could become skeletal muscle", "they could become nerves", "they could become skin", "and the way you differentiate them into skeletal muscle, which is like our muscles in our arms, is you put them on a scaffold that causes them to differentiate into that kind of thing", "a scaffold that is an edible gelatin like thing", "kind of it\u2019s basically some other food product", "like we have collagen and other stuff", "you have this scaffold of things, this [inaudible]", "the cells differentiate, and they merge together into these long fibers just like our muscle cells", "so, what were formerly discrete, standalone cells form into one long, multinucleated cell", "it twitches", "it does everything like a normal muscle", "it is a muscle cell of that species where i\u2019ve tasted the duck most recently", "\u00a0so, it\u2019s duck muscle", "and over time, you can add the irregularities of sinew and all of this", "but right now, it\u2019s just like a perfect cut of duck muscle", "the mouth feel, everything", "it\u2019s just the same thing", "everything is a filet mignon", "exactly", "and, by the way, in the future, you can make it healthier", "you can make it all omega 3 rich oils", "you could tune things", "but let\u2019s just start with the simple don\u2019t confuse the market with \u2013 it\u2019s not turducken", "it\u2019s turkey or it\u2019s duck", "it\u2019s not a blend", "but you imagine blending is like a simple thing", "there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t do infinite blending like blending a wine to make it just the right mouth feel, just the right whatever", "so, but in the near term, let\u2019s not jump ahead of ourselves", "it\u2019s just a substitute", "and you can do this in small like a chinese shipping container kind of thing", "so, you could put this near the point of consumption", "you could have this in urban areas, so you\u2019re not shipping meat all around the country", "you\u2019re growing the steak to order", "the end cost point should be much, much lower", "to me, this had one of those sort of lightning bolt moments of this is the inevitable future", "there\u2019s no technical risk that says this couldn\u2019t happen", "\u00a0there isn\u2019t like we have to invent something that hasn\u2019t been \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of system engineering to optimize it, the feed stocks, whatever", "it\u2019s building the right reactor size", "it\u2019s going to take some engineering, but it\u2019s not going to take breakthrough science", "it\u2019s the same epiphany that when i first rode in an electric car, when i first had an autonomous ride early on with the google ones, the old prius that they had automated, it\u2019s like this is the future", "you could just see it like a clarion bell ringing in your head", "and then, a few implications started to hit like wow, this will transform the world in a lot of ways", "the amount of land and resources and real estate plays that relate to meat production today", "not to mention mad cow disease, influenza, h1n1, all of these other things that those collateral damages of the food industry", "we haven\u2019t gotten to that", "you can see how we\u2019ll get from here to there, the buyers, the largest buyers of meat would absolutely like to diversify their supply chain, so they\u2019re not vulnerable to influenza or mad cow or any other disruption of the supply chain", "you can see how they\u2019re going to want to feather that in", "by the way, tyson and cargill, two of the largest meat companies in america invested in this company as well in the series a with us", "and but then, i realized something about myself", "i realized, for the first time, something where my future self-will condemn my present self as immoral", "so, i know that 50 years from now, once i\u2019m eating the bacon and steak that has not killed an animal in its production, will i be able to visit a slaughter house for the first time", "i won\u2019t do that today", "i like eating meat so much that i refuse to go visit a slaughter house", "in fact, of the usda meat inspectors, 99 percent of them become vegetarian", "they don\u2019t start that way", "if you see how it\u2019s made, you wouldn\u2019t eat it", "and yeah, i won\u2019t do that", "and when i say moral, i think humanities circle of empathy expands over time", "first, it was family unit", "then, the tribe, the nation state, then, maybe global citizens", "now, i think the interspecies, if you will, empathy is inevitable trajectory where i would welcome that where it would just be more thoughtful about other sentient organisms and their wellbeing that we just look right past today", "\u00a0it\u2019s kind of like being a slave owner in america back in the 1700\u2019s", "the economy depends on it", "i don\u2019t want to ask questions about how those slave ships \u2013 i\u2019m sure slave owners didn\u2019t visit slave ships, and the few that did were like oh, my god, we\u2019ve got to change this", "you just don\u2019t want to look", "and once you have the economic alternative that doesn\u2019t have any compromises, it\u2019s not like oh, it\u2019s not really bacon, or it\u2019s not really steak, it\u2019s the same thing just no animal died, then, you\u2019ll have the moral shift i think profoundly", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what is the current state", "what products do they have that \u2013 they\u2019re still in development because of the cost side at scale", "so, this company \u2013 so, when i mentioned the challenge of the plant based substitutes is engineering something that people won\u2019t mistake and that tastes as good", "that\u2019s the engineering challenge", "here, the whole thing is just cost because you can make something that\u2019s indistinguishable", "it just costs too much right now", "and there\u2019s three vectors of making it cheaper", "two are total give mes, and the one is engineering", "\u00a0the give mes are just making a bigger plant", "so, say you brew beer, if you just have a 1 liter facility on your desk top at home, and you amortize the cost of your home to make 1 liter of beer at a time, it\u2019s going to be an expensive liter of beer, even if the formula is the same as a huge production plant", "tim ferriss:\u00a0for sure", "so, scale", "the second is cheaper feed stocks", "just feed it something other than the very expensive serum they\u2019re using now in rnd purposes to minimize variables", "they\u2019re using pharmaceutical grade inputs, so to feed the cells, if you will", "what do they feed them", "is it like a glucose mixture with amino acids", "it\u2019s like a serum, a blood serum", "it\u2019s kind of like what you\u2019d find in your blood to make your blood cells live", "so, it\u2019s a variety of substances used for research purposes", "but there\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t be \u2013 but the reason it doesn\u2019t exist is there\u2019s no market for food grade plant based feed stocks that cells can grow off of", "and now, we have a good reason to do that", "and then, the third is just various engineering optimizations on the cells and the mixtures and what combinations of cells", "do you want to try to boost the fat content of each cell or have separate muscle and fat", "\u00a0do you want to have it all be like one bite does all, or do you want to have two different types", "well, a few thoughts occurred to me, as you were describing this", "the first is would this company ever utilize the technology to produce human tissue for regenerative medicine or other purposes", "and then, i thought to myself, wow, you could also become a moral cannibal, if you wanted", "you could produce, not that you would want to produce human burgers and eat them, but you could, ostensibly, do that", "but that was just more of a thought", "i was like wow, that\u2019s \u2013 well, you could also \u2013 a small donor to revive and restore, which is trying to bring back the mammoth and these species", "so, you could go back to have the mammoth", "that\u2019s true", "without growing the mammoth", "it would probably be gamey", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "the [inaudible] burger", "but is that maybe just a distraction", "i don\u2019t know the technology well enough to think of it from human medical perspective", "\u00a0no, it is a good question", "in fact, the first sort of clean meat or alternative meat company that i came across was using, ironically, the reverse sequence, which is it spun out of a company that was doing organs", "they printed bladders", "there\u2019s a kid i met who is 18 years old", "he\u2019s lived with a grown bladder for many years now", "and but that was more like a 3d printer", "so, when you\u2019re growing a specific organ that needs to be functional, it\u2019s super important to get a lot of the details right", "a chunk of skeletal muscle, if you just take it from the center piece versus the end with sinew", "there\u2019s variation if you want to make it function like a muscle", "and the connection to your sinews and what have you \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0if you\u2019re making ground beef from scratch", "right", "but if you\u2019re getting just a chunk of meat out of the middle, it\u2019s just a chunk of meat", "so, you have much bigger challenges with the printed organs that lent itself naturally to a 3d printer kind of approach", "and it works wonderfully for some organs", "they\u2019ve been growing kidneys and some of the connective tissue stuff around reconstructive surgery for the face and what have you", "\u00a0but it\u2019s slow", "and it\u2019s also a great example of personalized one to one marketing like you want to grow cells that are compatible with your body, so they would source your stem cells to grow your organ for you", "and it\u2019s kind of a different approach, in a number of ways, intuitively from what you want to mass produce for consumption where you could just have who cares what the cow \u2013 it could all be the same cow clone that you\u2019re growing the beef from", "whereas every human implant wants to be immune compatible with what you\u2019ve got", "so, the spin out didn\u2019t make as much sense to me to say let\u2019s try to produce metric tons of meat using that 3d printer", "in any sense of a 3d printer, i\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to figure out some way to scale that up", "but it just felt like, to me, there was a definite technology risk there to just \u2013 i couldn\u2019t see the hand waving or anything that says why is that going to get 1,000 times better", "it could, but i don\u2019t see why it has to", "it might not", "whereas this other thing, growing cells in a vat inherently scales", "it\u2019s like just have a bigger vat", "it\u2019s like it\u2019s 3d to start with", "it\u2019s not a 2d layering", "there\u2019s something about the manufacturing method that is born out in things like brewing beer and a variety of fermentation tasks where you kind of understand how to generate metric tons of stuff with a fermentation process", "\u00a0for people listening, like myself, who are not particularly, i\u2019m being generous, not technically trained, i\u2019m certainly not an engineer by any stretch, who want to make themselves more scientifically literate, are there any books or resources or approaches that you would recommend", "yeah", "there are two things that jump to mind", "one is a general purpose overview of what\u2019s important, almost like a survey level, where if you\u2019re just a business executive, and you want to make sure you\u2019re not blindsided by some development that may be relevant but not be a practitioner, and then, there could be a question of is there something that say you\u2019re a former autonomous vehicle driver, and now, you\u2019re looking for the next thing", "what might you want to study to engage in the economy as a practitioner", "and there\u2019s some areas that are more i think easily approached than others", "so, first, on the overall survey, i think there are some writers who do a good job bringing you, with a sort of overview mentality to like what\u2019s really going on in the world", "people like kevin kelly and maybe matt ridley and maybe \u2013 and a few others like this going back with [inaudible]", "there\u2019s been a variety", "but i might highlight, let\u2019s say, kevin kelly because the single book that\u2019s had the most influence on me my entire life is one of his earlier ones called out of control", "and really, it started my life long fascination of the biological metaphors in technology", "everything from all of that stuff we were talking about earlier about [inaudible] and iterative algorithms and evolution is itself an iterative algorithm", "the power of evolution, the power of genetic engineering, all of this stuff", "so, he was ahead of his time", "he wrote this book in the last century", "and it recently got translated to mandarin", "and it\u2019s just in the current day, it\u2019s probably one of the most popular books in china today, even though he wrote it decades ago because it\u2019s actually very relevant today", "so, that would be a good starting point, i think", "it segues into the technology that either as a practitioner or just you can read about this, if you just direct yourself", "\u00a0these are simple google searches, or i don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a particular book i\u2019d point out", "just to learn about deep learning", "learning about neural networks", "the reason i say that is i\u2019ve never seen a greater demand for a technology and a scarcity of supply", "like these salaries being afforded to engineers in this area are out of control", "a half million dollars for beginners", "who are some of the more credible thinkers or practitioners who talk publicly about deep learning", "let me think", "i\u2019m trying to think if there\u2019s a good overview", "the places \u2013 well, i know that coursera and some of these places are trying \u2013 and sebastian [inaudible] are trying to do deep learning courses and such", "and i haven\u2019t taken those", "i don\u2019t know how good they are", "i would imagine even some of the very technical people have given non-technical talks, whether it\u2019s at google or elsewhere", "i would imagine some of the thinkers that might be in their day to day work way too technical or specialized have probably given \u2013 \u00a0this is a tough one", "maybe for your show notes, i can try to come up with something", "so, part of the challenge i had is because i started a phd in this, i didn\u2019t seek the generic books", "and i\u2019ve been reading ones that, in the back of my mind, was that too technical", "but i bet you i can dig some up", "and it may sound self-serving, but i\u2019ve tried to give some of those talks, and when i go to conferences, a number of times, there\u2019s a real dearth of other people doing that same summarization", "but i would say that the group out of canada, so everything from hinton to joshua benjo to andrew ng, coming back to the us, in his case, they are both leading edge of rnd and such", "and they give really good talks", "it\u2019s just not all of them", "some of them are deeply technical", "some of them are overviews", "so, i\u2019ll try to find, for you, some examples of talks they gave that are for the average person", "perfect", "so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do then", "another thing i wanted to say about if someone actually wants to get into it, it\u2019s actually remarkably easy to learn", "when i said it\u2019s weird labor market, arbitrage is, i don\u2019t think it takes more than six to eight months to become a real domain expert in this", "\u00a0and you don\u2019t have to be spectacularly good at computer science before", "the background is just so different from normal computer science that, arguably, a new entrant has a great opportunity to just learn how these things are trained", "and forget about normal computer science", "and i can say a few things, in response to that", "the first is to recommend people check out, so we talked about tim urban a little earlier and the tail end and so on", "so, i had tim urban on this podcast, and i asked him how he got up to speed on topics", "and he went through his exact process", "he just talks to elon", "yeah", "elon lays it out to him", "he just calls elon", "so, for those people interested, if they just search tim ferriss show tim urban, that will pop right up", "and he spends about 20 minutes talking about exactly this, getting up to speed, which would be, i think, helpful for a lot of folks", "and when we chat, after this show, we\u2019ll text or email", "and then, in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast, you can just find this, and we\u2019ll have some additional resources for people who want to, including myself, dig into this and learn more", "have you ever given a \u2013 this will be maybe the last question or second to last question", "have you ever given a commencement speech", "funny you should ask", "once for my high school, and it was the most terrifying thing i\u2019ve ever done", "i love public speaking", "i did debate back in high school", "and when i\u2019m speaking to an audience that\u2019s somewhat similar to the audiences i\u2019ve spoken to before, check", "if it\u2019s on subject that i\u2019ve spoken on before, check", "if it\u2019s my [inaudible], i don\u2019t mind that", "oh, my god, trying to be relevant to a bunch of 18-year-olds, wow, that was tough", "it was back in dallas", "but i did that a few years back", "what did you talk about", "and maybe, if it\u2019s broad, what did people respond most strongly to of what you told them", "oh, i can actually give you show notes", "i managed to keep a copy, and someone even translated it in spanish", "oh, amazing", "great", "so, i\u2019m trying to remember what it was", "well, here was the advice i got that really helped was think about when you were their age", "and the more time i spent thinking about what life was like for me as a senior, because i went to that same school, it all sort of clicked into place", "the what do i want to do with my life, what\u2019s going on in the world, and sort of weaving what i was learning from venture capital and all of the amazing entrepreneurs that i was seeing to convey to them you are entering the most exciting period in human history", "and i shared a little bit about things we spoke about on this podcast around things going on in synthetic biology, things going on in ai, and what have you", "each of these areas is so rich with opportunity", "and i gave them some general advice about just thinking about your career as a pursuit of passion", "thinking about what you\u2019re uniquely good at that no one else in your random walk through life may have done", "and to keep that in mind as you hopefully infuse with a bit of technical open mindedness and creativity and childlike mind in exploration of what you want to do that it\u2019s just like there\u2019s no better time to be entering the world and trying to make a difference", "i tried to encourage them all to think entrepreneurially, to think about being change agents for the world, that everything that history books will be written about is some new entrant entering a field they didn\u2019t know much about prior", "and then, encouraging them that this is what increasingly defines the world we live in", "one question that somebody posed to me, when i was considering the question or considering unique strengths, i was like i don\u2019t know if i have any unique strengths", "i do a lot of things kind of well, but i\u2019m not sure", "maybe that\u2019s it", "maybe it\u2019s the pattern i\u2019m imagining across those", "and the question that they asked me was what do you find easy that a lot of your friends find hard", "and i was like huh", "and that actually ended up being a very helpful question for somewhat indirectly landing on the strengths because i had a lot of trouble with that", "so, maybe folks will find that helpful", "yeah", "because everyone does have some element to that question", "\u00a0and they also have something they\u2019ve done that, back to that early question, when i was entering venture capital, how am i different from every other venture capitalist who is trying to do this job", "there\u2019s something about your personal background", "it could be a language skill", "it could be wow, you had to take care of an aging grandmother in your youth, and so you have the sympathy and empathy for what the aged are going through that others lack", "that actually could be super hero strength, if you want to be an entrepreneur for this aging demographic of baby boomers", "not everyone, in fact, very few entrepreneurs think about the aged, for example", "and your unique strength can also be an unusual combination of two strengths, right", "i\u2019ve heard mark andreesson talk about layering public speaking on top of anything else and separating yourself", "warren buffet would say something very similar", "scott adams of dilbert fame has talked about this", "let\u2019s say you have an unusual combination", "so, maybe you have double the degree, and then, you have an mba", "and then, you know how to debate", "you don\u2019t have to be the best in the world at any of those things", "there\u2019s a lot of wisdom there because it\u2019s that pairing", "that\u2019s i think why most scientific breakthroughs are interdisciplinary", "they\u2019re someone outside of the field of chemistry working with someone maybe in the field to come with a breakthrough, not someone at the core of, again, an academic discipline", "and this is why universities are such areas of innovation is because they have all of the disciplines in one physical campus", "but if you just had a chemistry department or just a chemistry college, it wouldn\u2019t make world breaking changes", "people who figured out the structure of dna were like an ornithologist and a physicist, not chemists", "[inaudible]", "well, actually rosalyn parks needs to get credit", "let\u2019s give a shout out to her", "so, she\u2019s the traditionalist in that regard", "but more and more people think about elon not domain expert entering a new domain", "it\u2019s the cross pollination by bringing let\u2019s say software design modalities to the aerospace industry", "or calligraphy into personal computers", "exactly", "and so, that pairing i think harkens back to one other thought that might bring this whole thing full circle, which is every great idea is a re-combination of prior ideas", "this is a really powerful and simple idea that was popularized in three different books at the same time, which i think is meta ironic that their argument, at the same time, is every good idea happens around the same time", "\u00a0and the reason that\u2019s interesting is you can think in history, edison and tesla and mark [inaudible], it\u2019s like the time was right given the breakthroughs that had just happened in electricity and magnetism to think about ac induction motors and radio and everything else that got invented by all of those same people are all within months of each other", "today, at large, we have many more ideas", "we have the internet allowing us to cross pollinate ideas like never before", "these two things that are unique that you pollinate together, the calligraphy and the computer design for jobs or what have you, the number of possible pairings is growing combinatorial", "and i think that\u2019s why we have accelerating change in technology", "that\u2019s why moore\u2019s law exists over such a long timeframe", "it\u2019s not because of the semiconductor industry", "it\u2019s because the number of idea pairings is growing as to the end factor, it\u2019s called reed\u2019s law, with the number of ideas on the planet", "and once you break down the barriers between formally disputed academic disciplines and strip all of that vernacular away, there are independent ways of communicating with each other that are so isolating", "and you see the common patterns", "it\u2019s like wait a second, that\u2019s just like an information theory i saw there on the microbial design fronts", "\u00a0and that same problem \u2013 all of these rich array of new ideas is a sort of meta reason why you can\u2019t really quantify how strong it has to be", "we\u2019ll probably see more innovation than ever before", "and it\u2019s not just because we go we\u2019ll see more innovation than ever before", "it\u2019s because of this combinatorial explosion of idea pairings is happening globally", "and oh, by the way, it\u2019s about to explode when the next 4 billon people come online, and we go from 2 to 6 billion people online because of satellite broadband that space x and others are developing", "and that\u2019s all coming in the next five years", "like holy shit, we\u2019re going to have just an explosion of idea possibilities and innovation across the planet", "exciting time to be alive", "exactly", "especially when you have quantum computers accessing potentially parallel universes", "that\u2019s right", "where does it end", "it doesn\u2019t", "well, steve, thank you so much for taking the time", "this was really fun", "and as meandering as the path i forged, hopefully, you had fun as well", "and to be continued", "hopefully, we have many more conversations", "and i have so many more questions for you", "looking forward to it", "so, for another time", "but where can people find you online to say hello, see what you\u2019re up to", "sure", "so, on facebook, i\u2019m just user name jurvetson", "on flicker, user name jurvetson", "that\u2019s the ones that \u2013 most of my old writings are like the old stuff going back to 2004", "it\u2019s mostly on flicker", "and then, my social network addiction du jour is facebook", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and what is next for you", "what\u2019s next", "i\u2019m going to start a new venture fund at some point this year", "i haven\u2019t picked the name yet, but i\u2019m bouncing some ideas around to focus entirely on purpose driven businesses with really long timeframes where we never sell a share, at least i don\u2019t", "and we\u2019ll be investing in the kinds of things we talked about today", "companies that hopefully history books will be written about", "companies whose founders have a purpose greater than their own life on this planet and a purpose greater than certainly making a quick buck", "and there are more opportunities and more industry sectors than i\u2019ve ever seen", "like in the \u201890s, it was like software, semiconductors, and life sciences", "that was it", "i never imagined i would invest \u2013 \u00a0tim ferriss:\u00a0and justballs.com", "yeah", "man, it really went horribly wrong for a while", "just balls and [inaudible] being the pinnacle or the nadir of intellectual curiosity", "but now, it\u2019s just a flourishing coral reef of innovation everywhere", "and it\u2019s incredibly interesting time to be investing in startups", "can\u2019t wait to see what you do next", "thank you", "and to everybody listening, there will be plenty of links in the show notes, including things we promised, resources to deep learning and much more", "and you can check that out at tim.blog/podcast", "and, as always, thank you for listening"]}
