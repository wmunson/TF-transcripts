This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it\u2019s usually my job to deconstruct world class performers and tease out routines, the habits, favorite books, et cetera, that you can use. This is a slightly different format today. We have an in-between-isode, which is a shorter episode, a shorter format. We have a reloaded round 2 with Derek Sivers, by popular demand. Derek Sivers, @Sivers on Twitter, S-I-V-E-R-S. He\u2019s one of my all-time favorite humans. I call him often for advice. You can think of him as a philosopher-king, programmer, master teacher, and merry prankster. Originally a professional musician and circus clown \u2013 I\u2019m not kidding \u2013 Derek created CD Baby in 1998. It became the largest seller of independent music online with $100 million in sales for 150,000-plus musicians. He then sold CD Baby in 2008 for $22 million, giving the proceeds to a charitable trust for music education. I could use some talking education because I\u2019m chewing my words today. This particular episode is composed and comprised of questions that you guys submitted in part. There are a number of questions I didn\u2019t get to asking him, and he answers those. He cut my voice out of other episodes to do so. Then there were questions uploaded on Reddit for him to answer, which are promoted on Facebook and on Twitter, so you guys could participate. He asked those folks to send in audio. The questions he answered were, in part, determined by those willing to send in their questions via audio from all over the planet. He answers things such as successful, who\u2019s the first person that comes to mind? How should one share themselves or their work online? Probably the best answer I\u2019ve heard anyone give. Parenting advice, or at least his practices. Socrates and learning programming. Now those are related. One of my favorite quotes that I\u2019ve ever heard him put out there: \u201cIf more info were the answer, we\u2019d all be billionaires with perfect abs.\u201d He talks about the difference between knowing and doing and how to bridge that gap. Habits for living a successful life and what he would do if he were starting over with $1000 in the bank and just the clothes on his back, could not use his name or face recognition to do anything. This episode is worth listening to, even if you just listen to the last 3 minutes. That is where he answers the question: what is something you believe that other people think is insane? He expands that to mean what unpopular opinions do you hold. It is awesome and hilarious. If you want to listen to the first interview that I did with Derek, you can just go to fourhourworkweek.com/Derek, all spelled out, but this one stands alone. You can listen to it independently or just by itself. I suppose those are the redundancy, department of redundancy department. That is it. Please enjoy this solo act by Derek Sivers. Tim: When people ask you, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d How do you answer that? Derek Sivers: Oh, that\u2019s a heavy question for everyone, isn\u2019t it? We think, \u201cOh no. This is my big moment. This is where I define who I am!\u201d I heard that Stewart Brand gives a different answer every time he\u2019s asked. I like that. It\u2019s a good challenge. If you search YouTube for the British magician Derren Brown doing his hypnotizing handshake \u2013 I think one of his videos is called Russian Scam \u2013 he holds out his hand as if to shake yours, but then when you lift up your hand to shake his, he grabs your forearm with the opposite hand instead, and he puts something else in your hand. It\u2019s all very confusing. It puts people into this state of confusion, where they\u2019re open to suggestion to help find some reason for what\u2019s going on here. He\u2019s got this great, little book called Tricks of the Mind that I highly recommend, where he tells how he did something similar to stop a mugging. He was held up at knife-point in a dark street once. The attacker said, \u201cGive me all your money!\u201d and Derren Brown just turned to him and said, \u201cMy grandfather had a wall that was 5 feet high. Little ducks all around. Do you know the type? Like this?\u201d and a few more nonsense sentences like that. The mugger was just completely thrown off and he walked off derailed. I think confusion is a great way to break habits. Lately, when someone asks what I do, I tend to say something like, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it before.\u201d That just derails the whole routine of a boring conversation. It lets them know we\u2019re not just painting by numbers now. Also, I think it\u2019s like finding someone who doesn\u2019t know their name. \u201cHow could you not know your name? How could you not know what you do? Poor guy must have amnesia. Let\u2019s help him figure it out because we can\u2019t just have someone walking around not knowing what it is they do now, can we?\u201d Tim Ferriss: When you think of the word \u201csuccessful\u201d, who\u2019s the first person who comes to mind and why? Derek Sivers: The first answer to any question isn\u2019t much fun because it\u2019s just automatic. What\u2019s the first painting that comes to mind? Mona Lisa. Name a genius. Einstein. Who\u2019s a composer? Mozart. This is the subject of the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. There\u2019s the instant, unconscious, automatic thinking and then there\u2019s the slower, conscious, rational, deliberate thinking. I\u2019m really, really into the slower thinking, breaking my automatic responses to the things in my life and slowly thinking through a more deliberate response instead. Then for the things in life where an automatic response is useful, I can create a new one consciously. What if you asked, \u201cWhen you think of the word \u201csuccessful\u201d, who\u2019s the third person that comes to mind? Why are they actually more successful than the first person that came to mind?\u201d In that case, the first would be Richard Branson because he\u2019s the stereotype. He\u2019s like the Mona Lisa of success to me. Honestly, you might be my second answer, but we could talk about that a different time. My third and real answer, after thinking it through, is that we can\u2019t know without knowing a person\u2019s aims. What if Richard Branson set out to live a quiet life, but like a compulsive gambler, he just can\u2019t stop creating companies? Then that changes everything, and we can\u2019t call him successful anymore. Tim Ferriss: What are the most common misconceptions about you? Derek Sivers: Oh, I feel pretty understood. I don\u2019t think people are thinking about me enough to conjure up any misconceptions. We think the goal of writing and communication is to be understood, but I think a better goal is just making sure that you\u2019re not misunderstood. I learned this the hard way at my last company because we had a quarter million customers. When I\u2019d sent out an email to everyone, if any sentence was at all unclear in any way, I\u2019d get 50,000 confused replies from people, which would take my team a thousand man hours to go through. Anything I put out into the public is rewritten and edited like crazy until I think it\u2019s as clear as can be. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s talk about your morning rituals. On your ideal morning, what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like? When you wake up, what morning rituals are important to you, et cetera? Derek Sivers: Not only do I not have morning rituals, but there\u2019s really nothing that I do every day except for eating or some form of writing. Here\u2019s why: I get really, really, really into one thing at a time. For example, a year ago I discovered a new approach to programming my PostgreSQL database that made all of my code a lot easier. I spent 5 months every waking hour just completely immersed into this one thing. I bounce out of bed at 5 in the morning and programming SQL code for 19 hours from 5am until midnight. I\u2019d stop maybe an hour or two a day to go for run or talk on the phone with a friend. Then after 5 months, I finished that project. I took a week and I went hiking in Milford Sound in New Zealand. Totally offline. When I got back from that, I was so zen nature-boy that I spent the next couple of weeks just reading books outside. Then it was time for me to prepare my big keynote speech for this conference, which tied into something I\u2019d been wanting to do for years anyway, which were all those book notes turned into directives that we talked about last time. For the next 3 or 4 months, I did nothing but that. Again, like 5am until midnight, just doing that one thing. When I\u2019m really into my work, you can\u2019t pry me away when I\u2019m really in the zone like that. I don\u2019t want to hang out, I don\u2019t want to watch anything, I don\u2019t want to distract myself in any way. I\u2019m just so into what I\u2019m doing. If I think back to when I started CD Baby, it was just like a little thing like this that I thought was going to last a few months, but it ended up lasting 10 years. For those 10 years, like 7 days a week from 7am until midnight, I did almost nothing else but that. Sometimes a project can last for years. The point is I can picture that ideal world, where I spend a few hours a day on each of my top 3 priorities, but I just get so in the zone with one thing that it feels like going against my nature to break that. I read once that people who were happiest with their life, when interviewed at the end of their life, were the ones who had spent the most time in that state of flow, just being in the zone. Although I feel I probably should have these morning rituals and daily habits, I just don\u2019t. Knowing this, I can plan accordingly. If I want to learn a language, it\u2019s probably not going to be by doing it 2 hours a day, but just total immersion. Tim Ferriss: What are you world class at that people might not realize, or what do your friends know you\u2019re world class at that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t know about? Derek Sivers: I\u2019ve got the world\u2019s longest attention span. I\u2019ll just sit down and do one task for 12 hours straight, or all day for 25 days in a row. I love that my kid is getting it from me by the way that we play. Whenever we play, I never say, \u201cLet\u2019s go, time to go\u201d. We just do something until he\u2019s ready to move on. He\u2019ll lead me to the river and just throw rocks in the water for a couple of hours. Then we\u2019ll go the ocean and build a fort out of driftwood for hours and then draw in the sand with the shells until he\u2019s sleepy. We\u2019ve always done it this way, since he was 1 year old. Other families would come play on the playground for 20 or 30 minutes at a time, but we would just be there for hours with him fully immersed in some newly invented game. What\u2019s funny is that nobody else can hang with us like this, not even his mom. Everyone else gets so bored. People ask if I meditate or do yoga, but no. My daily life feels like working meditation. Even being with my kid is like meditation, as you can tell. Now we\u2019re doing the format today, where we\u2019re going to open up the phone to callers, but since it\u2019s Christmas Day, the phones are a little \u2026 Hey. There\u2019s a call. Sam Davies: Hey, Derek. This is Sam Thomas Davies from Stockholm, Sweden. My question is where are you up to with the Do This Project? Are you going to be sharing your findings on your blog? Many thanks. Derek Sivers: Yes, definitely. In the first podcast, I said I had 18 sentences, but really I have 18 categories, such as how to be useful to others, how to get rich, how to like people, things like that. Altogether, I\u2019ve got about 120 directives, and each one, I think, requires a little more explanation. Instead of just listing them all, I think each idea deserves its own little spotlight, a little page that can be linked to and shared about just that one idea, instead of only the entire list. If you want to be notified when they\u2019re ready, just get on my private email list either by going to sivers.org/list or just email me to ask. It\u2019s derek@sivers.org. I think they\u2019re going to be my next 120 blog posts, really. Then, afterwards, I\u2019ll just post the big list with each point linking to those past posts for more information. Then, when done, I guess I\u2019ll probably make it a book. Tobin: Hi, this is Tobin in Boulder, Colorado. My question is what are a few directives for sharing thoughts online in an authentic way, particularly for introverts? Thanks. Derek Sivers: That\u2019s not really an introvert/extrovert thing. I think everyone is scared to show their work publicly. At least doing it online is easier than getting up on stage. The best book on this subject is called Show Your Work by Austin Kleon. You can see my notes on it at sivers.org/book, but I highly recommend just getting the book and reading the whole thing. It\u2019s awesome. As for directives, since you asked, I\u2019ve got 4. Number one: teach whatever you\u2019ve learned immediately after learning it while you still remember what it\u2019s like to not know it. Once you get used to knowing it, you can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to not know. Number 2: share your work online. If your work isn\u2019t online, it basically doesn\u2019t exist. Number 3: share the process and the residue of your work. People really do want to see how the sausage gets made, so become a documentarian of what you do. Number 4: release your creations some time after completion, so once you\u2019ve already moved on to the next thing. That way when the world gives you its feedback or critique, it won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s reflecting on you, but just some work you did in your past. Eamon: Hi, my name is [Eamon 16:43] from [Rog-o 16:44]. My question is why and how did you become a programmer? Derek Sivers: For me, it was absolute necessity. I think that\u2019s the best way to learn anything. There\u2019s this story about Socrates, that a student came to him and asked, \u201cSocrates, how do I get wisdom?\u201d Socrates said, \u201cCome with me,\u201d and they walked down to a nearby lake. When the water was waist high, Socrates suddenly grabbed the student\u2019s head and held it under water. At first the student thought it was a joke, but then Socrates kept holding him. He started panicking and struggling to get up and his lungs started burning. Finally, Socrates let him up coughing and gasping for air. Socrates said, \u201cWhen you desire wisdom as much as that next breath then nothing will stop you from getting it.\u201d If you want to start programming, first you have to have a problem that you need to solve. You have to feel the pain of the problem first and then go find its solution. Usually that means just start trying to build something that you need so you can find out what you don\u2019t know. Also, I think it helps to learn from a well-written book that guides you through things that you didn\u2019t even know existed. Search Amazon for a programming book released in the last few years, where multiple reviews say that it was good for a beginning to use. Reviews would say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m a total beginner. This one really helped me.\u201d Those are the books I gravitate towards for learning a new thing. As for me, it wasn\u2019t until after my business, CD Baby, took off that I started learning programming out of necessity, because I was doing hours a day of manual labor, like copying and pasting things and processing everything by hand. By learning to write some really simple, little 20-line programs, I saved myself hundreds of hours of work \u2013 the ultimate motivation. Then, as my company grew, each new thing I learned to automate would save my whole team hours a day of work. Yeah, the ultimate motivation is necessity. Now I just love it for its own sake. I think it\u2019s fascinating, and the lifestyle suits me. I love to sit in solitude and think and make things. I love the immediate feedback you get from it. I highly recommend it to anyone interested. Tobin: Hi, this is Tobin in Boulder, Colorado. My question is what are some directives for creating relationships with people who hold interesting worldviews? Thanks. Derek Sivers: You make people interesting. If you\u2019re boring, they\u2019re boring. If you\u2019re interested, they\u2019re interesting. I\u2019ve read a lot of books on people skills, and they\u2019ve all been worth the time. Some of them are How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie. That\u2019s the classic. Start with that. How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes; How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less by Nicholas Boothman; and Power Schmoozing by Terri Mandell. They have the most awful titles, but really every book I\u2019ve ever found on the subject of people skills has been great. I highly recommend that you go read 5 different books on the subject of people skills to get you into a considerate mindset. Then just practice with anyone. I think start with low stakes. You\u2019re actually probably a better conversationalist if you don\u2019t think that someone is a VIP. I have a funny story about that. Back when I was a musician trying to get famous, I went to a music business conference, where I was trying to meet VIPs from record labels that could sign me to a record deal. It was such high stakes, and I was so nervous. Then during a break, I went out to just go dip my feet in the pool and exhale a bit. I was sitting next to some dude that was just doing the same thing. We started shooting the shit about that girl over there and the silly platters of food they had laid out and why people come to these events in the first place, stuff like that. After a while he needed to go. He got up and he handed me his card. He said, \u201cYeah, nice to meet you.\u201d He gave me his card. It turned out that he was the vice-president of A&M records. I was like, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d If I\u2019d have known, I\u2019m sure I would have been an uptight mosquito. I learned a lot about being a good friend and conversationalist from that moment. He and I are still friends to this day. He sent me some of my biggest clients when I started CD Baby. Start with low stakes. Then, ideally, stay with low stakes. Lastly, I think it really helps when you have something to show for yourself. You\u2019ve got to have some kind of cred, because people want to meet another winner. Whenever you\u2019re introducing yourself, definitely don\u2019t hide your accolades. It helps to just have a little timeline that hints at the fact that you got something going on. David: Hi, Derek. This is Dave DiGiovanni from Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the USA. Thanks for doing the podcast with Tim. Thanks for taking this question. You\u2019ve helped a lot of people make money. I\u2019m just wondering if success in business has to be more complicated than that. I get overwhelmed reading all the \u2026 There\u2019s so much content out there on how to make money, how to grow your business, how to start a business. I\u2019m just wondering if business needs to be more complicated than coming up with ideas on how to help other people succeed. Thank you. Derek Sivers: Let\u2019s talk about 2 things: simple versus complicated and easy versus hard. Look at running. If you talk with people who hate running, you\u2019ll hear them say, \u201cUgh. First, you have to get your running clothes then you get dressed. Then you\u2019ve got to put on your shoes then you\u2019ve got to lace them up just right. Then you\u2019ve to stretch and then you\u2019ve got to warm up. Then, afterwards, you need to cool down. Then you need to shower. It\u2019s such a pain!\u201d If you talk with people that love running, they\u2019ll say, \u201cYou just pop out for a quick run.\u201d If you ask them about the steps involved, they\u2019ll say, \u201cThere\u2019s just one: you just run.\u201d Knowing that we have this human nature to think of things we like as simple and things we don\u2019t as complicated, you can use this to deliberately simplify how you think of something you\u2019re avoiding, making it more appealing. An ultra-marathon is simple: you just run 100 miles to the end, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy. Success in business can be simple. You just find a need that people are proving they are willing to pay for and then find a profitable way to solve that need for them, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy. What you have to do is notice in your mind when your complications are holding you back. Turn the dial towards simplicity in your mind, so you just jump out the door and start running. Then notice in your results when a simplified approach might be holding you back. Perhaps you\u2019re using only one tool in your toolbox, and you need to learn others. As for all the business advice out there, if information was the answer then we\u2019d all be billionaires with perfect abs. Really, you \u2013 yeah, you, listening to this \u2013 most of you probably just need to shut that shit off, put your blinders on, and get out the door and start running, metaphorically speaking, that is. Matt: This is Matt in Toronto, Canada. My question is, on the homepage of sivers.org and during your podcast with Tim, you mentioned that your personality type is INTJ. How has knowing your type affected your life? Has it played a role in any major life decision? Derek Sivers: To me, it doesn\u2019t really matter much. I think it\u2019s just shorthand for a basic description of my preferences. I could write a few paragraphs about how I love solitude and I love making systems, or I could just link to the INTJ description because I think it says it pretty well. I think the Myers-Briggs are like \u2026 It\u2019s like we made 16 little clubs, like Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw. Because of these Myers=Briggs types, you can see someone else and say, \u201cOh, hey. You\u2019re a Ravenclaw, too.\u201d I\u2019ve met a few other INTJs who contact me because I have it right there in my self-definition. We always seem to get along really well. I think it\u2019s cool. As for affecting my life, I found that when I stopped going against my introvert nature and instead just decided to shape my life around it, it made me very happy, because, before that, I used to do a lot of really extroverted things, thinking that I had to. Now I work alone instead of around others. I say no to almost all big group things, and instead spend really good one-on-one time with other people, and I\u2019m happier than ever. I really think it\u2019s one of the best changes I ever made in my life. Tobin: Hi, this is Tobin in Boulder, Colorado. My question is what should someone ask to determine their own utopia? Thanks. Derek Sivers: First, ask yourself, \u201cIs this in theory or in practice?\u201d Have you proven from your experience that this is really what works best for you? Whatever idea you have, you have to challenge it. You need to argue against it because there are so many things that seem great in theory. For example, say you\u2019re living in a little apartment in a noisy city. You think that you\u2019d be happy if only you had a big place out in the silent country. You do it; you splurge, you buy a place, or you sign a year-long lease. Then you move out to the country and, uh-oh, after 2 months, you realized that you missed too many things about the big city. You made the wrong prediction. It happens the other way, too. People moving from the quiet burbs to the big city, or somebody who\u2019s an employee that thinks they\u2019d just be happy if they could quit their job and start their own business. Oops! It doesn\u2019t always work out like that. My recommendation is to do little tests. Try a few months of living the life you think you want, but leave yourself an exit plan, being open to the big chance that you might not like it after actually trying it. The best book about this subject is Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert. His recommendation is to talk to a few people that are currently where you think you want to be and ask them for the pros and cons. Then trust their opinion since they\u2019re right in it, not just remembering or imagining. James McGeough: This is James [McGeough 28:04] from Sligo, Ireland. My question is how do you define success? What habits or skills are most important to living a successful life? Thanks. Derek Sivers: First, let\u2019s define success. Ask yourself if you think Robin Williams and Philip Seymour Hoffman were successful actors? I think it\u2019s a tough call. First reaction is yes, but the more I think about it, my answer moves halfway towards no. A different example: think of someone you know who you\u2019d consider to be the definition of a total loser. Now you give that person a million dollars. Are they now a winner? Of course not. That sounds like a contrived example, but a lot of fame and fortune is dropped into the lap of people who were just the right face in the right place at the right time, but are actually miserable, awful people by any definition. The more you think it through, the more you realize that you have to define success first by your inner game, not some outside measure of money or fame; mastering yourself, your mind, and your actions. If you only master yourself and you, don\u2019t help anyone else, then we\u2019d call you happy, but nobody would define you as successful. The very definition of success must include how much you helped others. I\u2019ll bet that if you helped thousands of people, even if you didn\u2019t ultimately profit from it, but you were personally miserable, we might still call you successful because you helped others. The point is if you want to be undeniably successful, you need to both master yourself and help others. Don\u2019t focus on the money or the fame. The real success is mastering your emotions and actions and actually helping lots of people. The definition, but now you asked, \u201cWhat habits or skills are most important to living a successful life?\u201d By this definition, habits and skills. Number one: the skill and habit of managing your state and your emotional reactions and actions. Number two: knowing what people need in general and what you need in particular. Number three: people skills; how to see things from the other person\u2019s point of view and how to communicate from their point of view. Number four: the ability to focus, learn, practice, and apply what you learn. If you can do those four things, you can do anything. You can first be happy without depending on anyone or anything in particular. Then you can understand what people need, learn how to provide it, and make sure they know it. James: Hi, this is James in New Zealand. My question is if you instantly lost all your resources, money, contacts, et cetera, had no possessions except the clothes you\u2019re wearing right now and $1000, and look like you\u2019re a completely different person, i.e., no one would recognize you, what steps would you take to become successful? Derek Sivers: Notice how we all assume that when you say \u201cbecome successful\u201d you really mean \u201cget rich\u201d. As we covered in the last question, money is almost moot in what it means to be successful. If you took absolutely everything away from me, I\u2019d still be successful because I know how to be happy, how to be considerate, how to be useful, and how to learn. It sounds like I\u2019m being Mr. New-Age Positivity, but it\u2019s really not. This was learned the hard way. I\u2019ve spent years with very little, with just a few hundred dollars in the bank. Now I\u2019ve spent years with millions in the bank. I found that having millions gives you a nice sense of security, but when I look at my daily life, I\u2019m not even using the money. Here\u2019s what actually makes me happy: a quiet little place to live alone, a working laptop, access to the internet and books, enough money for food, my good health, and, let\u2019s say, 2 good friends. Everything past that is bullshit. If I had $1000 and these clothes, I\u2019d already be successful because I\u2019m successful at thinking, learning, and thriving. That\u2019s all I need to be happy. What would I do? If you actually want to know the actions, if that really happened, what would I do? I\u2019d just go get any old job. I\u2019d find an old used laptop for $100 and install Linux on it, I\u2019d go get a teacup and some tea, and I would get back to reading, learning, writing, thinking, and sharing what I\u2019ve learned because, to me, that\u2019s success. My only expensive qualification is that I like to live alone. I\u2019d probably use my programming skills in return for rent so I could have my own place at first. I think even if I had no skills at all, if you put me a few hundred years into the past or future, I know how to focus, learn, and practice. There are these skills, like sales and marketing, that everyone always needs help with. Now if you\u2019re talking about how to make a lot of money, I\u2019d probably pick almost any of the paths online that are in these programs that are out there about how to make a lot of money, but the ones that aren\u2019t a long shot to mega millions, but the ones that are really just proven strategies on how to pick a business and optimize it. I think it\u2019s like diet and exercise plans, where most of them work well enough if you actually follow through and do what they say, not just half-ass it, but really do it all the way. Any of those would work. Tim Ferriss: What is something you believe that other people think is insane? Derek Sivers: Oh, that\u2019s easy. I\u2019ve got a lot of unpopular opinions. I believe alcohol tastes bad, and so do olives. I\u2019ve never tried coffee, but I don\u2019t like the smell. I believe all audio books should be read and recorded by people from Iceland, because they\u2019ve got the best accent. I believe it would be wonderful to move to a new country every 6 months for the rest of my life. I believe you shouldn\u2019t start a business unless people are asking you to. I believe I\u2019m below average. It\u2019s a deliberate cultivated belief to compensate for our tendency to think we\u2019re above average. I believe the movie Scott Pilgrim is a masterpiece. I believe that music and people don\u2019t mix, that music should be appreciated alone without seeing or knowing who the musicians are and without other people around. Just listening to music for its own sake, not listening to the people around you and not filtered through what you know about the musician\u2019s personal life. I believe it\u2019s unwise to prioritize lifestyle design because it\u2019s dangerously self-centered, and you\u2019re rewarded most in life for keeping your focus on being useful to others. I believe loyalty is silly, that we should constantly try to be disloyal and only be loyal to the rare person, place, or idea that we\u2019re just unable to be disloyal to. I believe it\u2019s good to feel smug. It means you\u2019re proud of yourself, which means you\u2019re living according to your beliefs.", "speakers": ["tim ferriss", "sam davies", "derek sivers"], "text_sentences": ["hello, boys and

your shoes then you\u2019ve got to lace them up just right", "then you\u2019ve to stretch and then you\u2019ve got to warm up", "then, afterwards, you need to cool down", "then you need to shower", "it\u2019s such a pain!\u201d if you talk with people that love running, they\u2019ll say, \u201cyou just pop out for a quick run.\u201d if you ask them about the steps involved, they\u2019ll say, \u201cthere\u2019s just one: you just run.\u201d knowing that we have this human nature to think of things we like as simple and things we don\u2019t as complicated, you can use this to deliberately simplify how you think of something you\u2019re avoiding, making it more appealing", "an ultra-marathon is simple: you just run 100 miles to the end, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy", "success in business can be simple", "you just find a need that people are proving they are willing to pay for and then find a profitable way to solve that need for them, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy", "what you have to do is notice in your mind when your complications are holding you back", "turn the dial towards simplicity in your mind, so you just jump out the door and start running", "then notice in your results when a simplified approach might be holding you back", "perhaps you\u2019re using only one tool in your toolbox, and you need to learn others", "as for all the business advice out there, if information was the answer then we\u2019d all be billionaires with perfect abs", "really, you \u2013 yeah, you, listening to this \u2013 most of you probably just need to shut that shit off, put your blinders on, and get out the door and start running, metaphorically speaking, that is", "matt: this is matt in toronto, canada", "my question is, on the homepage of sivers.org and during your podcast with tim, you mentioned that your personality type is intj", "how has knowing your type affected your life", "has it played a role in any major life decision", "to me, it doesn\u2019t really matter much", "i think it\u2019s just shorthand for a basic description of my preferences", "i could write a few paragraphs about how i love solitude and i love making systems, or i could just link to the intj description because i think it says it pretty well", "i think the myers-briggs are like \u2026 it\u2019s like we made 16 little clubs, like hufflepuff, gryffindor, ravenclaw", "because of these myers=briggs types, you can see someone else and say, \u201coh, hey", "you\u2019re a ravenclaw, too.\u201d i\u2019ve met a few other intjs who contact me because i have it right there in my self-definition", "we always seem to get along really well", "i think it\u2019s cool", "as for affecting my life, i found that when i stopped going against my introvert nature and instead just decided to shape my life around it, it made me very happy, because, before that, i used to do a lot of really extroverted things, thinking that i had to", "now i work alone instead of around others", "i say no to almost all big group things, and instead spend really good one-on-one time with other people, and i\u2019m happier than ever", "i really think it\u2019s one of the best changes i ever made in my life", "tobin: hi, this is tobin in boulder, colorado", "my question is what should someone ask to determine their own utopia", "thanks", "first, ask yourself, \u201cis this in theory or in practice?\u201d have you proven from your experience that this is really what works best for you", "whatever idea you have, you have to challenge it", "you need to argue against it because there are so many things that seem great in theory", "for example, say you\u2019re living in a little apartment in a noisy city", "you think that you\u2019d be happy if only you had a big place out in the silent country", "you do it; you splurge, you buy a place, or you sign a year-long lease", "then you move out to the country and, uh-oh, after 2 months, you realized that you missed too many things about the big city", "you made the wrong prediction", "it happens the other way, too", "people moving from the quiet burbs to the big city, or somebody who\u2019s an employee that thinks they\u2019d just be happy if they could quit their job and start their own business", "oops", "it doesn\u2019t always work out like that", "my recommendation is to do little tests", "try a few months of living the life you think you want, but leave yourself an exit plan, being open to the big chance that you might not like it after actually trying it", "the best book about this subject is stumbling on happiness by daniel gilbert", "his recommendation is to talk to a few people that are currently where you think you want to be and ask them for the pros and cons", "then trust their opinion since they\u2019re right in it, not just remembering or imagining", "james mcgeough: this is james [mcgeough 28:04] from sligo, ireland", "my question is how do you define success", "what habits or skills are most important to living a successful life", "thanks", "first, let\u2019s define success", "ask yourself if you think robin williams and philip seymour hoffman were successful actors", "i think it\u2019s a tough call", "first reaction is yes, but the more i think about it, my answer moves halfway towards no", "a different example: think of someone you know who you\u2019d consider to be the definition of a total loser", "now you give that person a million dollars", "are they now a winner", "of course not", "that sounds like a contrived example, but a lot of fame and fortune is dropped into the lap of people who were just the right face in the right place at the right time, but are actually miserable, awful people by any definition", "the more you think it through, the more you realize that you have to define success first by your inner game, not some outside measure of money or fame; mastering yourself, your mind, and your actions", "if you only master yourself and you, don\u2019t help anyone else, then we\u2019d call you happy, but nobody would define you as successful", "the very definition of success must include how much you helped others", "i\u2019ll bet that if you helped thousands of people, even if you didn\u2019t ultimately profit from it, but you were personally miserable, we might still call you successful because you helped others", "the point is if you want to be undeniably successful, you need to both master yourself and help others", "don\u2019t focus on the money or the fame", "the real success is mastering your emotions and actions and actually helping lots of people", "the definition, but now you asked, \u201cwhat habits or skills are most important to living a successful life?\u201d by this definition, habits and skills", "number one: the skill and habit of managing your state and your emotional reactions and actions", "number two: knowing what people need in general and what you need in particular", "number three: people skills; how to see things from the other person\u2019s point of view and how to communicate from their point of view", "number four: the ability to focus, learn, practice, and apply what you learn", "if you can do those four things, you can do anything", "you can first be happy without depending on anyone or anything in particular", "then you can understand what people need, learn how to provide it, and make sure they know it", "james: hi, this is james in new zealand", "my question is if you instantly lost all your resources, money, contacts, et cetera, had no possessions except the clothes you\u2019re wearing right now and $1000, and look like you\u2019re a completely different person, i.e., no one would recognize you, what steps would you take to become successful", "notice how we all assume that when you say \u201cbecome successful\u201d you really mean \u201cget rich\u201d", "as we covered in the last question, money is almost moot in what it means to be successful", "if you took absolutely everything away from me, i\u2019d still be successful because i know how to be happy, how to be considerate, how to be useful, and how to learn", "it sounds like i\u2019m being mr", "new-age positivity, but it\u2019s really not", "this was learned the hard way", "i\u2019ve spent years with very little, with just a few hundred dollars in the bank", "now i\u2019ve spent years with millions in the bank", "i found that having millions gives you a nice sense of security, but when i look at my daily life, i\u2019m not even using the money", "here\u2019s what actually makes me happy: a quiet little place to live alone, a working laptop, access to the internet and books, enough money for food, my good health, and, let\u2019s say, 2 good friends", "everything past that is bullshit", "if i had $1000 and these clothes, i\u2019d already be successful because i\u2019m successful at thinking, learning, and thriving", "that\u2019s all i need to be happy", "what would i do", "if you actually want to know the actions, if that really happened, what would i do", "i\u2019d just go get any old job", "i\u2019d find an old used laptop for $100 and install linux on it, i\u2019d go get a teacup and some tea, and i would get back to reading, learning, writing, thinking, and sharing what i\u2019ve learned because, to me, that\u2019s success", "my only expensive qualification is that i like to live alone", "i\u2019d probably use my programming skills in return for rent so i could have my own place at first", "i think even if i had no skills at all, if you put me a few hundred years into the past or future, i know how to focus, learn, and practice", "there are these skills, like sales and marketing, that everyone always needs help with", "now if you\u2019re talking about how to make a lot of money, i\u2019d probably pick almost any of the paths online that are in these programs that are out there about how to make a lot of money, but the ones that aren\u2019t a long shot to mega millions, but the ones that are really just proven strategies on how to pick a business and optimize it", "i think it\u2019s like diet and exercise plans, where most of them work well enough if you actually follow through and do what they say, not just half-ass it, but really do it all the way", "any of those would work", "what is something you believe that other people think is insane", "oh, that\u2019s easy", "i\u2019ve got a lot of unpopular opinions", "i believe alcohol tastes bad, and so do olives", "i\u2019ve never tried coffee, but i don\u2019t like the smell", "i believe all audio books should be read and recorded by people from iceland, because they\u2019ve got the best accent", "i believe it would be wonderful to move to a new country every 6 months for the rest of my life", "i believe you shouldn\u2019t start a business unless people are asking you to", "i believe i\u2019m below average", "it\u2019s a deliberate cultivated belief to compensate for our tendency to think we\u2019re above average", "i believe the movie scott pilgrim is a masterpiece", "i believe that music and people don\u2019t mix, that music should be appreciated alone without seeing or knowing who the musicians are and without other people around", "just listening to music for its own sake, not listening to the people around you and not filtered through what you know about the musician\u2019s personal life", "i believe it\u2019s unwise to prioritize lifestyle design because it\u2019s dangerously self-centered, and you\u2019re rewarded most in life for keeping your focus on being useful to others", "i believe loyalty is silly, that we should constantly try to be disloyal and only be loyal to the rare person, place, or idea that we\u2019re just unable to be disloyal to", "i believe it\u2019s good to feel smug"]}
