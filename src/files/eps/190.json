This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where is it my job to deconstruct world-class performers and tease out the habits, routines, morning meditation practices, favorite books, whatever it might be, that you can use and test in your own life. One of my most popular episodes to date was with Matt Mullenweg, who is best known or thought of as the lead developer of WordPress, which now powers more than 25 percent of the entire web. He is the CEO of Automattic, which is a multi-billion-dollar startup, fully distributed. He loves tea; he loves tequila; he loves Chicken McNuggets. He\u2019s an incredible guy. He\u2019s very good at using a keyboard layout known as Dvorak, as well. We had a very, very long conversation. You\u2019ve all been asking for a Round\u00a02. So in this episode, he answers your most popular questions, which were up-voted online. You can say hello to him online on Twitter @photomatt; that\u2019s photo M-A-T-T. So please enjoy Round 2 with Matt Mullenweg. Matt Mullenweg: All righty. Hello, hello everybody. This is Matt Mullenweg coming back to the amazing Tim Ferriss podcast. It\u2019s been actually not that long since I was last on here, but a lot\u2019s changed for me and the company. When I was last coming to you all to a conversation with Tim filled with much tequila, WordPress was about 23 percent of the internet. We\u2019ve gone up to about 26.5 percent, which I\u2019m really happy about. My company Automattic has changed a lot in that time, too. We were about 300 people when I last spoke to Tim and we actually just this week passed 500. So things have grown a lot. But I am excited to be checking out some of these questions you sent and that Tim and Adam compiled. So I guess let\u2019s go ahead and dive in. All righty. Let\u2019s start from Steve Rubell. He asked: What\u2019s the hardest part about running a company with a distributed workforce? One that perhaps others don\u2019t fully consider when trying the same. Hmm. You know, a lot of the how-to and technical sort of logistics, the tactics of running a distributed company, I think are getting better and better. We use Zoom for video conferencing and Slack for chats; P2s on WordPress instead of email. Google apps are really good. So a lot of the basic tools are out there and they\u2019re getting better every day. In terms of being able to communicate certainly with one person, you can do that extremely at high fidelity almost instantly from wherever you are in the world with an internet connection. I think there\u2019s still challenges in terms of getting a group of people on the same page. However, I don\u2019t perceive those challenges to be that much different from what people who work in the same office have. So I talk to friends with startups of a similar size to Automattic \u2013 you know, 400 or 500 people. They\u2019re typically spread across a couple floors in a building or a campus. They talk about how they have to repeat themselves a lot and sort of really hone in messages and do town halls and all these sorts of things that get everyone in the company on the same page. So I think that just might be something difficult about groups or scaling organizations. That as soon as it goes above what can be in one or a couple people\u2019s heads, there\u2019s a drift that happens between how different people imagine what a goal is. The thing I found best for that, even though it wasn\u2019t your question, is to have some sort of prototypes or mockups, or there\u2019s an Amazon thing when they\u2019re starting a new project, they write the press release for it. Or I would call it, write the blog post for it. So write what the announcement will look like when you tell the world about this. So techniques in that low-fidelity mockups can really help make sure everyone\u2019s thinking about the same thing when you use the same words, which is surprisingly difficult. Finally, the thing that I\u2019ll say is hard about distributed that\u2019s not talked about that I think I uniquely appreciate right now because once a year the entire company of Automattic comes together. We call is our \u201cgrand meetup,\u201d as opposed to the normal meetups which teams do individually and are usually like five to ten people. The grand meetup we bring the whole company and this year it was in Whistler, British Columbia, up in Canada. So we had about 460 people out of the 500 there. It was incredible. It\u2019s pretty much my favorite week of the year. People are so different and everyone\u2019s weird in their own ways and unique and has crazy hobbies. A couple days before, I actually did overlanding with two colleagues across from Calgary to Whistler, so we were off-road and doing crazy things in Jeeps. Then there\u2019s a band where people play together. Everyone gives flash talks, so little miniature five-minute talks about a topic they\u2019re interested in. So the aftermath of that is that I think the thing about being distributed is that it can be a little lonely. I really love my colleagues. I love spending time with them, I love learning about them, and I love talking to them. It\u2019s true that in person is still the best way to connect with someone. Virtual has gotten better, but there\u2019s so many more sense that are engaged in ways you can read people and you can share a drink or break bread or share food. When you\u2019re in person, we don\u2019t have virtual equivalence for it yet. So I think that\u2019s one of the hardest things, assuming you like your colleagues. You miss them and it can be a bit lonely. So one thing I always encourage, especially when younger folks maybe straight out of college join Automattic is to make sure you have a good social work outside of work because sometimes we default to getting that human connection and that engagement from our colleagues. That\u2019s not a bad thing at all. I\u2019m a little jealous of folks who go to an office every day with awesome people who get to do that. But when you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s important to develop that social network outside of it. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons I love hanging with Tim or other friends in San Francisco when I\u2019m there. When I\u2019m in Houston, it\u2019s a lot of my friends from high school and family. So making sure you have that social layer to support you and keep you connected with the world so you don\u2019t become a weird hermit. All right. Next question. Jeffrey McLeod: Now that you have many hours of travel and work under your belt, what used to be an annoying experience with working on the road that you have adapted to or overcome? Hmm. So travel-wise, I would say two of the coolest thing you can do as a traveler are, especially if you are a U.S. citizen, are get pre-check (it\u2019s a total game changer), and I think this is related, there\u2019s a program called Global Entry that lets you bypass all the customs lines when you\u2019re re-entering the U.S. Not all the customs lines \u2013 all the immigration lines. You just go straight to this machine that scans your fingerprints and you just breeze on through. You feel like you\u2019re in the future. It\u2019s amazing. So that definitely whenever I go through the pre-check line or the Global Entry line, I just feel amazing. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s totally rational, but it feels really good. The thing that\u2019s probably changed the most over the few years is just connectivity. You can have an LTE connection in the U.S. pretty much everywhere. When I\u2019m international, I use Google Fi, which is kind of a cellphone service from Google that works in over 100 countries. It\u2019s $10.00 a gigabyte. Or if I\u2019m going to be in a country for a longer period of time, sometimes it\u2019s cheaper to just buy a local sim card. But once you have that LTE connection, you don\u2019t have to worry about WiFi anymore because you can tether to a computer. You don\u2019t have to worry about does the coffee shop I\u2019m in offer this? Or does my hotel have \u2013 I mean, hotels are the worst for WiFi. The more expensive the hotel, the worse it is too. You could stay in like a Motel 6 and they have fast and free WiFi and then I\u2019m in like a Ritz Carlton and they want to charge me $15.00 or $20.00 a day for it and it\u2019s so slow. So just that mobile connectivity I think has changed because anyplace that I have my backpack and an internet connection, I can be fully productive. I can have my keyboards, my mice, my headphones, everything and I can work just as if I\u2019m at my desk at home and connect with Automatticians and just do my job I have to do as CEO. So that is the thing that has definitely helped me the most. I also am constantly updating sort of the kit of what\u2019s in my backpack that is my super hero bag; everything I have. I do a blog post on this once a year. If you just search for \u201cMullenweg what\u2019s in my bag,\u201d you\u2019ll see them. I\u2019m sure Tim can link to them in the notes as well. So that changes every year. Yeah, check that out, check out that blog post. Another one from Jeffrey is he says: If you could start from scratch with what you knew know, what part of growth, personal or professional, would you have omitted or asked for more of? I think on the professional end, I just emphasize that hiring and being thoughtful about hiring is the best way to scale an organization. I feel like that\u2019s one of the things that to me [inaudible] question what\u2019s your super power? I don\u2019t actually remember what I said last time, but if I were to answer it today, actually it\u2019s hiring. I\u2019ve done it now enough and looked at enough r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and everything that \u2013 and we have a process at Automattic that tries to remove a lot of the bias from things. You get the right people around the table and it makes all the difference in the world. What I would tell my younger self to avoid professionally is probably \u2013 it sounds a little tricky. So oh, that\u2019s one thing I forgot. After the podcast with Tim and before now, Automattic ended up doing another round of funding. We raised about $160 million. Maybe that was before; I don\u2019t recall exactly. So that funding has really transformed the areas that we\u2019re able to move into, the things we\u2019re able to work on. I think previous points in Automattic\u2019s history we were capital constrained and that held back our growth, the growth of Automattic [inaudible]. The other thing that I\u2019ve really been learning a lot that I would tell my younger self is the thing about marketing. I\u2019ve always been kind of like a \u201cif you build it they will come.\u201d To be honest, for most of my career, that\u2019s worked. I\u2019m now starting to appreciate more and more how marketing and getting your message out there in the right way, it wasn\u2019t that WordPress didn\u2019t do it before, it\u2019s that we did a lot of it and didn\u2019t really think about it. We kind of lucked our way into it. I think being systematic in approaching that with as much care as you would to pixels and the design or how an interface works or how the architecture of the code is really crucial to a great product. It\u2019s one of those fundamental tenets and bases of a product that resonates with lots of people. On the personal life, I\u2019d probably tell myself to start meditating more. All the basic stuff: meditate, exercise, eat well, boring stuff I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard on every single podcast Tim has done. More on the personal side, I would say that learning to be vulnerable and sensitive was something that, especially when I was younger, I was just like \u201cgo to the world and show no weakness.\u201d Because I was young and I was often operating with people who were decades older than me or getting investment. I thought I had to be invincible or put on this air of invincibility. Of course, no one is invincible. As a leader and actually through meditation, I\u2019ve become a lot more empathetic. Part of that isn\u2019t just understanding and feeling other people\u2019s emotions, but being willing to show your own weaknesses and emotions and be vulnerable. I think it\u2019s Brene Brown\u2019s book, Daring Greatly, talks about this really well. Or Krista Tippett on Becoming Wise, another great book. I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Those are some good areas for listeners of the podcast who have maybe done all the stuff from Four-Hour Body and Four-Hour Workweek and are thinking about growing their soul more. It might be some good avenues to investigate. James Clamaut asked: What\u2019s the most important skillset for an entrepreneur to develop and what characteristics do you look for when recruiting new employees? There\u2019s another question that I think is a little related to this. Neil Harris Demarhos says: What are some skills you look for in non-technical people? So I\u2019m going to tie that into the recruiting question. So important skills for an entrepreneur to develop: resilience, a balance where you can maintain your health, both mental and physical, while working really, really, really hard, and exactly what I just talked about, empathy. Actually just yesterday I saw an amazing presentation from Julia Hartz, who is the CEO of EventBrite, where she really spoke about this as a lesson that\u2019s she\u2019s learned over the past few years where being vulnerable and showing empathy is one of the things that\u2019s helped her most as a CEO, which is counterintuitive. So I\u2019d say those skills are very important. Also, just the basics. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur, learn about term sheets, learn about preferences, learn about all the mechanics of your business. Know enough accounting that you can talk to your accountant. Know enough development that you can talk to your developers. Know enough marketing that you can talk to your marketers. You have to know at least a bit about really every part of your business, because that\u2019ll allow you to hire and recruit people that really understand it. Of course, you want them to understand it way better than you, but by having even just a common vocabulary that you can converse with that person in, you\u2019ll be able to operate with them at a much higher level than if you were just a complete novice in their given area of expertise. By the way, you can also have them teach you. It\u2019s an amazing way to grow these skills. I rely on our ops team at Automattic very heavily. I think that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve been really lucky about. Everything with HR and finance and legal and everything. They\u2019re just super top-notch and I both learn a ton from them and don\u2019t have to worry about that, which has been amazing. So the characteristics you look for in recruiting new employees and what do you look for in non-technical people question? The saying is from a basketball guy and he was like, \u201cYou can\u2019t coach tall.\u201d So four of the qualities I look for are the things that you can\u2019t really teach. That\u2019s work ethic, taste, integrity and curiosity. If you think about all of those, if someone has those four things: work ethic, taste, integrity and curiosity, I believe that you can learn pretty much anything in the world. If you look at any expert, this is something that I think is good to remember. If you look at Elon Musk on space rockets or Tim on health and fitness, well, all the things Tim\u2019s an expert on, or any of these different areas, remember at one point that person knew nothing about it. We\u2019re all born, we all learn and so I really do truly believe that you can become an expert in any field if you put in the hours and the work and the practice and everything. If someone has those four things, I know that they will be able to rise to whatever the job and role requires of them. Of course, we look for experience and such in order to shortcut that process a little bit. But I also know that for every person I hire at Automattic, what we\u2019re doing today and what they\u2019re hired for is likely not what we\u2019re going to be doing 5 or 10 and certainly not 20 or 30 years from now. When we hire, I do it with the expectation that someone\u2019s going to be at the company for decades to come. It\u2019s not just a short stint, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really a long-term relationship. It\u2019s like getting married. I think about not just where they are today, but how will they adapt when the company changes and when the world changes and when we\u2019re all in the singularity? So those sort of intrinsic and tough-to-teach things become more and more important. Next question. This comes from Rock M. Fard: If WordPress is the platform of writing and Shopify is of commerce, are there other similar platforms you think are worth developing? That\u2019s a good question. There are a few areas that I think are sort of like fundamentals for interaction on the web that there aren\u2019t great open source tools for yet. Or, in some cases, good tools in general. One area that\u2019s getting a ton of investment now that even though there aren\u2019t perfect source things, I think we\u2019re in a pretty good place is just messaging. So between Slack and Facebook is making Messenger, Telegram, WhatsApp, messaging built into platforms like Instagram and all of this, I feel like the communication side of things is being pretty well invested. But then when you think about how communication happens online, there\u2019s still so much to do there. So, for example, we actually have something we\u2019re reviving a little bit called \u201cblicki,\u201d which is the combination of a blog and a wiki. Basically, the idea is that wikis are pretty cool, but you lose when you have everyone being able to edit everything. You lose some of the elements of moderation or curation that make many websites great. So a blicki is essentially something in between. It\u2019s a moderated wiki. So anyone can edit it, but the edits go through a moderation queue, much like the comments on WordPress go through a moderation queue that can be accepted or denied. So you can get the best of both worlds of community participation and the curation and editorial direction that comes from great websites and blogs. So I think wikis are an area that need some innovation. Forums as well. Forums are so much fun. I learned a lot of what I\u2019ve done and had lots of great conversations on forums. I know Tim has as well. I know it\u2019s kind of one of these things that forums aren\u2019t really sexy, so no one talks about them or looks at them. We have a product called bbPress there that we use for the support forums on WordPress that are on WordPress.com and it\u2019s used by some other folks. That\u2019s definitely an area I\u2019d like to invest more into and I think that needs better platforms for. You mentioned commerce and Shopify. Shopify is an incredible tool. Commerce is actually an area we\u2019ve moved into. We did an acquisition of a platform called WooCommerce, which is built on top of WordPress. I think that commerce \u2013 for many ways, commerce is where blogging was in 2007, 2008, where there\u2019s some great hosted tools and some great open source tools like WooCommerce. But if you want to use WooCommerce, you probably need to be a little more tech savvy or have a developer. We\u2019re entering the area much like where WordPress was in 2008, where we\u2019re starting to make it so anyone can use the software, so you get kind of the best of the ease of use of other platforms, but the flexibility of having complete control over your domain, the code, everything. You can customize it. I think that\u2019s a winning combination. I hope that over the next couple of years, WooCommerce can live up to its fantastic competitors in the marketplace, including Shopify, Ecwid, Bigcommerce, etc. Finally, you said we\u2019re the platform of writing and I\u2019m very flattered there, but still with blogging, and especially with comments, I think there\u2019s so much more to do. You just got me really excited to get back to work. I almost want to stop the podcast and go talk to some teams around WordPress and Automattic. So that was a good question. The toughest thing that I deal with day to day is a lot of the stuff I just talked about, outside of Woo, which we\u2019re making huge investments in. Our ideas we had, sometimes even five or ten years ago that because our opportunities with our main business lines, which are WordPress, Jetpack and WooCommerce, are so much that it\u2019s tough; we have to focus in on them. There were years, and maybe this goes back to something I would tell my earlier self professionally. So in the early years of Automattic we deluded ourselves. We spread ourselves too thin. So we really had to say no to a lot. That\u2019s how I understand that famous Steve Jobs or Johnny Ives line, like \u201cA great product is saying no to a thousand things.\u201d I used to think that was a thousand buttons and you say no to 999 of them. I think now it resonates with me more saying that in addition to these things we\u2019re focused on, there\u2019s 999 other things that we\u2019d love to be working on. Areas I\u2019d love to tackle. It\u2019s really saying no to even just the future of the product, but to working on other products entirely. Some other things that makes me excited about \u2013 scaling Automattic from 500 people today to 5,000 in the future \u2013 is that we can do our core areas really well and make sure that those continue to be the best in the world, but also it spans the breadth of what we work on. All right. Next question. This is from, I\u2019m going to say Jocko Timmonen. I apologize for everyone\u2019s names. I\u2019m doing my best to pronounce them.\u00a0Send me a Tweet or something afterwards that I could do it better. He says, and this actually relates to the say no to 999 things: What has been the most important default setting in you that you\u2019ve later questioned and removed?\u00a0By default setting, I mean a value or behavior that\u2019s been hardwired by parents, environment, education, or society. I think it\u2019s almost just more than a specific default setting, which I probably have some things I do difficulty. I type the Dvorak layout instead of the QWERTY layout. Or just living distributed versus living in a home or being in one place or building companies in a different way. It\u2019s just the fact that you\u2019re constantly looking at default settings. So I\u2019d say, Jocko, by this question, you\u2019re probably thinking about it the right way because my default settings and the way I grew up in society and everything like that is going to be different from yours. So the things that need to change will be different and our situations are different. So what you should think about is just asking yourself that question at various intervals. This is why I love the Christmas/New Year\u2019s time, because it forces you to take a step back and look from the 10,000 feet view. But I try to do this \u2013 it\u2019s actually something that happens a lot when I\u2019m trying to meditate and I can\u2019t quiet my mind and I\u2019m thinking of lots of things. Sometimes I\u2019ll just take a pause and be like okay, I\u2019m just going to not meditate, but also not do anything, not look at my phone, not do anything. Have a piece of paper and just try to see everything that\u2019s caught up in my mind and where do I think that\u2019s going, how do I think it\u2019s \u2013 sort of unwind my mind in terms of what\u2019s stuck in there and what are the things I\u2019m thinking about. And that often leads me to take that step back from the day to day and look at things from a broader sense. Is my life heading in the right direction? Are my relationships in the right place? Who are the people that I love and care about but maybe haven\u2019t spoken to in a few weeks or a few months or maybe even all year? So those sort of steps back I think cause you to look at your own operating system. Actually, something that I think meditation is great for is almost like an interrupt. I read a cool book called, I think it\u2019s called Search Within Yourself. It\u2019s a fellow at Google that started, I think it\u2019s even called Search Within Yourself Meditation and Mindfulness Program. I believe his name was Jade Ming Tong. He kind of has an engineering background and also a Googler, so the book I think is pretty cool for leaders of companies because it talks about the business benefits of mindfulness. From an engineering point of view, how mindfulness and meditation is almost like a background process that runs and whenever your operating system throws up like an interrupt like a reaction or emotion to things, it can kind of catch that. So before you immediately react and do the thing that would be sort of your first intuition or reaction to an emotion or a thought, it says, hey, wait a second. That\u2019s essentially the muscle you\u2019ve developing when you meditate. When I started thinking of it that way, I was like, wow, okay. So just like I might do a plank or pushups or something like, I need to work this muscle every day if I can. I think it\u2019s impossible to do that and not think about your default settings or go back to the first principles of why you do things, the reason why you got into what you in the first place. Are you truly happy? These are tough questions, but ones that you can honestly, with the distraction of day-to-day life and our phones and our blogs and our social media, it is so easy to just be lost minute to minute and be busy all day and not really bring yourself closer to the mountain that you want to climb. I would say if you are listening right now, maybe even pause and just take ten minutes, whether you\u2019re driving in the car or whatever you\u2019re doing, just pause the podcast and do nothing. Have zero inputs and just think about that. All right. I guess we\u2019re back now. Next question is from Matthew Arnold: Hard work in and of itself does not seem to guaranty success. It\u2019s true. There are plenty of truly hard working entrepreneurs who businesses will fail. To what other factors besides hard work do you attribute your massive success in business? Luck, good mentors, timing? All right, Matthew \u2013 which is an awesome name \u2013 thank you for that question. I think it\u2019s definitely all \u2013 it\u2019s funny that when people call me successful, I don\u2019t think of myself as that way. I think part of that, even though I know objectively by many measures I have been and I\u2019ve been extraordinarily fortunate and lucky and everything. But part of it\u2019s because I fail so often. So I don\u2019t think that yes, if ten businesses were started today, nine of them would fail. By the way, including if I did them. So it\u2019s not how many times you fall, it\u2019s how many times you get back up is really key. People talk about resilience and all these things. So that is true. Even like I think of business icons and the greatest companies of our time. Facebook has products that fail all the time. They launched Poke \u2013 like a Snapchat rip-off. Amazon, which I am a huge admirer of Jeff Bezos. Do you remember the Kindle phone? That was just like last year. That was a huge failure. And not just a huge failure like one that they must\u2019ve spent the better part of a billion dollars on. So we don\u2019t stop failing. It\u2019s just you want to hopefully design your systems to assume failure and have some back-up plans: a Plan B, a Plan C, a Plan D, all the way to a Plan Z, so that you\u2019ll be able to get up and fight another day. Just whatever that drives you to do it. I think having a higher motivation beyond the extrinsic things, which might come from success. So something more than money, something more than material goods that motivates you is really key and so that\u2019s kind of the thing that I would attribute it to. Especially in business press. We just see when people hit the home runs. We don\u2019t see all their at-bats. Very rarely do we even know about all the at-bats they\u2019ve had. So just remember that. No matter how bad a day you think you\u2019re having, there\u2019s probably someone you admire who\u2019s probably also having a bad day right this second. You\u2019re not alone. Next up. Julian Bosley: You have 30 minutes before the end of the world and you find yourself in a very well-stocked bar next to an amazingly varied delicatessen. What choice of food and drink did you enjoy? I liked this question a lot because well, I love food and drink. I\u2019m actually on a quest right now to go to all the top 50 restaurants in the world. There\u2019s a list that gets published I think by Pellegrino or sponsored by Pellegrino. I\u2019ve been to 9 of the top 10 and I think about 40, 45 percent of the top 50. These experiences from these chefs, it\u2019s like a whole out-of-the-world thing, but I love food and drink. Now usually when I\u2019m drinking \u2013 part of why I like this question \u2013 is there\u2019s 30 minutes before the end of the world and generally when I engage in libations, I try to stick to the same alcohol all night. This is just something I\u2019ve learned from trial and error; mostly error. When I mix different types of alcohols, I feel kind of terrible. I heard a saying once that \u201cDrinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.\u201d That\u2019s true to an extent, especially if you mix. But if I stay with one, you know, if I stay with a great Casa Dragones all night or wine all night, or whiskey all night \u2013 I\u2019d say those are my three favorites (of course, to a reasonable degree; if you have too much of anything, it\u2019s bad for you) \u2013 I\u2019m typically pretty okay the next day. But the truth is I love all sorts of different drinks. There\u2019s great drinks made by gin and rum and other things, like great cocktails that I would love to have but I typically avoid because I don\u2019t want to drink gin all night. So for the drinking part of things, I would basically have a bunch of everything at the bar and just enjoy it, preferably in some great cocktails. In terms of a wine, I actually love California wines. There\u2019s some great, old California wines like an Alpha Omega or just some of the classics. For basically the last thing, I\u2019m going to assume this delicatessen has a foie gras and I know this is so bougie, I can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m saying this, but like there\u2019s an experience that foie melts on your tongue and then you wash it down with like a great Sauterne, like a Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem. Just the best one that the bar has. It is a party in your mouth. It\u2019s almost impossible to describe the sensation of what goes on there with those two tastes interacting. So that would be like 29 minutes and 45 seconds the thing I would have. Then otherwise from the delicatessen, I would probably just go for a couple good sandwiches. Definitely like eggs and cheese and bacon on a croissant is a go-to that always gives me joy. It\u2019s funny, we\u2019re coming up on Thanksgiving and everything Thanksgiving, I\u2019m like man, turkey is so good. Why don\u2019t I eat more turkey? And especially you know those day-after turkey sandwiches where you have the pulled turkey, like the dark meat, and then you get some mayonnaise, cranberry and horseradish and just like kind of mix up the sandwich a lot? Pickles, lots of pickles. Maybe something like, maybe even mix in some sauerkraut or some kimchi, something fermented in there. That would probably be like my go-to, super good deli sandwich. Julian, thank you, because this question was super fun for me to think about because I really went in a lot of different directions.\u00a0Some mixed cocktails, some good wine, and then ending it off with a great Sauterne. All right. Next question. We\u2019ve got Alexander Francesco Newman: Matt, what are your thoughts on artificial intelligence web developer designer tools such as The Grid or Wix ADI? Will WordPress use some sort of AI developer or designer feature in the future? Or just an AI? This is kind of funny. I don\u2019t like to talk bad about competitors, so I won\u2019t mention any specifically, but I do think that right now there\u2019s kind of an almost like a completely viscous marketing hype cycle around AI that has nothing to do with artificial intelligence at all. So people are just slapping \u201cAI\u201d on everything, maybe before they slapped \u201ccloud\u201d on stuff. That just isn\u2019t AI at all. So I think it\u2019s really just marketing. Nothing I\u2019ve seen in the marketplace so far is much more than vaporware and a good demo. I do think that essentially what they come down as kind of wizards. It\u2019s not that different from what a clippy would do in Microsoft Word in the \u201890s. So I think there\u2019s much better approaches to that sort of problem. Now, embedded in that is do I think that there\u2019s changes we could make to WordPress that would make it easier for folks to get going or get started? The thing I think about which is really our biggest challenge and the thing I work on every day, which is how do you connect? Bridge that gap between what someone imagines and what they\u2019re able to create. So absolutely, that\u2019s what we work on every day. Big parts of Automattic work on how do we make it easier and more intuitive to have that effortless flow as you\u2019re building things? That is at the core of what we do. In terms of AI and sort of that impacting the business, I think that we\u2019re still a few or many years away from that being more useful than a well-designed, traditional interface. Actually, a really great essay about this \u2013 we\u2019ll find the link for the show notes \u2013 but essentially, there\u2019s a fellow who looked at all the chat bots, which are sort of an area of AI right now. For Messenger, for Telegram, there\u2019s these bots and you can say, \u201cHey, I want a pizza.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat kind of pizza do you want?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cHmm, how about some pepperoni?\u201d Or maybe it\u2019s smart, so it says, \u201cHey, you usually get pepperoni. Do you want some pepperoni?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, let me have some pepperoni. But oh darn, it\u2019s not my cheat day, so deliver it on Saturday instead.\u201d So you sort of have this conversational interface, that sometimes people call AI, with this product or service that you consume or buy or interact with. Basically what this essay does is it compares that model to what a lot of folks in the US are trying to copy, which is the success of platforms like WeChat in China. It shows how these days WeChat actually it\u2019s not that you\u2019re purely chatting with someone and asking them, which sounds to me like the inconvenience of calling a restaurant to get a reservation versus using like a Reserve or an OpenTable to just click a few buttons and get one. WeChat really embeds these interfaces. He talks about the number of taps it takes to chat with a bot to get something versus the taps \u2013 I think maybe he even uses the pizza example \u2013 to order a pizza in China on WeChat through this mega-conversational platform. I think that\u2019s one of the areas where a great interface can still surpass a chat. One thing that we\u2019re doing \u2013 so I\u2019ll give you all a preview of something we\u2019re working on for WordPress.com \u2013 is we actually are working on a new chat interface. So we provide for paying customers live chat support. It\u2019s a great experience. You\u2019re connected with a real, live human being and they will help you through whatever you\u2019re having trouble with. So it\u2019s real intelligence. It\u2019s better than artificial intelligence; they can help you with anything. There\u2019s some disadvantages to this though in terms of it\u2019s difficult to scale in terms of we\u2019re hiring people as fast as we can and we\u2019re happy with the happiness engineers at Automattic, but we want to create tools that enable them to just reach more people. So we\u2019re working on this new chat system and the two big things it changes are (1) it abstracts out who you\u2019re talking to. Because right now \u2013 and by the way, I do live chat support sometimes too \u2013 so if you\u2019re chatting and you have maybe three or four chats going on simultaneously, you\u2019re helping people, it\u2019s a little bit difficult both to wrap those up, like say you want to go to lunch, but even things like using the restroom. You don\u2019t want to leave the people you\u2019re chatting with hanging because they\u2019re waiting for you. So by abstracting it out, so basically you\u2019ll be chatting with an agent or a cartoon character, whatever it is that we decide, instead of a specific person, we can allow transferring of chats between people way easier behind the scenes. So you could have an \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom\u201d button or \u201cMy dog just starting chewing on the couch\u201d button and the chat could be transferred to someone that gets all the transcripts and everything and could just pick it up instantly and keep the chat going, invisibly to the person they\u2019re chatting with. But (2) is we\u2019re looking at, and this is an area I like way more than artificial intelligence, which is machine learning. So we now have all of the chats. I mean, at this point, probably close to a million interactions we\u2019ve done or way more than a million. Emails, chats, everything. So we can apply \u2013 and I\u2019m going to say a buzzword \u2013 \u201cdeep learning,\u201d which I\u2019m going to say is not totally hype because there\u2019s been some amazing open source tools released by Google like TensorFlow and all of the technology is actually pretty useful here. To learn from those and essentially augment the happiness engineers, the people doing support, by when we get something that looks a lot like what we\u2019ve seen before, we can suggest essentially like a pre-reply, like an answer for them that saves them having to type out or do everything. Then they can customize that or use that to augment their ability to chat with folks. So this has been a pretty cool project in the area where I think AI could actually have a real impact versus just be marketing hype. Hamid Fadifar asked: If you hadn\u2019t accomplished what you\u2019ve accomplished and started over with nothing, what would the next six months of your life look like? This is a pretty trick question because there\u2019s a lot of ways to think about it. I think the first way I thought about it was, well, if I just lost everything, like I had to declare bankruptcy and had no assets or anything, the obvious thing, I have lots of friends and family, so that\u2019s sort of my safety net. So I would probably move back in home and start to rebuild from there. But that\u2019s probably not how you intended it and hopefully, unless the question is, if you don\u2019t have friends and family that you think would take you in if you were having a hard time, develop some deeper relationships, you never know what\u2019s going to happen. And by the way, that means that you\u2019ll take them in if they\u2019re having hard times. It\u2019s totally reciprocal. Then there\u2019s the version of this question I\u2019ve seen before, like what if you knew everything you know but you\u2019re homeless one day? So you lose everything and you don\u2019t have any friends or family you can sort of fall back on. So you\u2019re kind of alone in the world, but you have all your knowledge. What would you do? My answer there again, and this also assumes the privilege of being in the United States and things like that, is I would probably go to the external version of friends and family, which is maybe a church or a YMCA or one of the nonprofits that tries to help out people with nothing, and sort of use that as a home base to then develop. The other version of this that I thought of was well what if instead of all that you have your house, you don\u2019t need to worry about surviving, but you are starting something brand new. So the thing I would do first here is \u2013 so I know everything I know now \u2013 I would use my craft, engineering or music, essentially get a job. So I think I would probably look for the most interesting company I could get access to and just do my best to be hired there. Create a really great application. Really craft, learn a lot about their business and go into interviews knowing a ton about it. Try to stand out. If they say no, keep trying to be hired and really put the \u2013 just to try to get around a great group and have a great job where I know I\u2019ll learn and start to save and develop the net for which I could do something more entrepreneurial in the future if I wanted to, which I think is what you\u2019re getting at with the question. So I get this job. There was a saying when I was a musician, \u201cYou never want to be the best musician in the band.\u201d Ideally, you\u2019re the worst musician in the band because that means you\u2019re learning from every single person around you. So I would try to find a company or a group or someplace where I could be the worst musician in the band, where just every single person was so much better than me. I still made the cut to make it in, but then I would just be learning from everyone around me every day. If I was just trying to start something new and it couldn\u2019t be related to anything I had done before, so it couldn\u2019t be content management or ecommerce or any of the areas that WordPress kind of plays in, I think what I would try to do is figure out the zeitgeist. So I would buy a copy of The New Yorker and New York magazine and The Economist and Wired and Fast Company and I\u2019d just read them cover to cover, maybe for a month or two, maybe get some back issues, and try to figure out what area is in the good part of the hype cycle. So something like VR or AI is probably in the bad part of the hype cycle where the expectations people have for it are so out of line and we\u2019re just early, too early in terms of the impact that the technology can have. So I\u2019d try to look for an area that is no longer \u2013 maybe I would go back three or four years on those magazines and look for something that was hot then but no one\u2019s talking about then. That\u2019s probably where the biggest opportunities are. So the thing that everyone was excited about five, six, seven years ago; it got a ton of overinvestment and companies have started and failed, and now it\u2019s at that point in the cycle where the real stuff is happening. Like the carpetbaggers and the folks who are in it just for money have all like come and gone and it\u2019s just the people who really want to make a difference in the world are still there are working. In some ways, I think content management is in this area right now, where a lot of the hype was four or five, six years ago. But now we\u2019re actually reaching scale and having an impact on hundreds of millions of people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s where the big opportunity is. That might be outside of the web \u2013 areas like CRISPR or gene editing. Some of the bio stuff I think is getting pretty interesting. We\u2019re approaching times when the devices \u2013 cellphones, some mobile stuff is probably in this area right now where we have more than a billion mobile devices. No one\u2019s really thinking, I\u2019m going to start an app. That kind of when it\u2019s most interesting to start an app. When WordPress started, the biggest criticism was that there are too many blogging systems and the world didn\u2019t need another one. So that would be what I would try to find. What do people say the world doesn\u2019t need another one of because there\u2019s plenty of it? And try it out. Carlos Reale: Where do you see the future of the internet in terms of user behaviors, given that 20 years ago people started to use and visit websites. Now most people just use their phones and when VR becomes useful, it\u2019s like we\u2019ll all live on a VR platform and the phone will fall like the desktop. Hmm. So my hope is that phones don\u2019t fall like the desktop because even in a world where the VR is super amazing and we\u2019ll all be plugged into the Matrix, I still really hope that I can go on a hike with Tim. Or get out in the world and see some of the beautiful things all around us in nature and in cities and in instruments live and concerts and things like that. So when I\u2019m mobile, something like a phone will hopefully be on me and I hope that\u2019s still there. So in terms of the internet, I think the behavior that\u2019s changing the most is still just this megatrend that we\u2019re still riding where there\u2019s six billion people still coming online. So everything that we think is amazing and huge and big now is going to 6X or more likely 10 or 100X where it is in terms of user interaction, in terms of posts per day, in terms of number of people tweeting. All of this is going to be so, so, so much bigger than even the already amazing levels it has reached. As people become more comfortable being native online, the same cycles that people listening to this podcast might remember about 15 years ago where you were nervous to put your credit card online or things like that. Folks coming online for the first time are going to have those same nervousness and go through the same, hopefully accelerated, learning process of what\u2019s it like to truly live digitally and live online? So I think that will be adopted faster. I also hope that payments will be an area we can have a lot of innovation on because the friction of payments I think puts us in business models like advertising right now, which aren\u2019t the best. How cool would it be that everyone listening to this could give \u2013 instead of Tim having advertising or doing whatever he needs to do, everyone listening to this could just put in a dollar or maybe even not a dollar, maybe put in like two pennies, some sort of micropayments that could support creators all over the world. Like right now, the payment systems that we have just aren\u2019t set up for that, but I could imagine something like that being really cool in the future. The thing that I think is going to have to change user behavior-wise is we need to develop more antibodies, more immunity. Because the technology is going to get better and better and better at engaging us. Machine learning. And in the future 20 years from now, when we do have something more approaching artificial intelligence, could entertain us perfectly and keep us always connected and engaged with whatever companies want us to be engaged with. Because a lot of this will be commercially drive. So that worries me a little bit. It\u2019s a little more Brave New World, 1984. It reminds me of that great intro to Brave New World. No, it\u2019s Neil Postman. I think he wrote a book called Amusing Ourselves to Death. There was an intro. We\u2019ll put it in the show notes. That\u2019s the one made into a comic that was pretty amazing in terms of what 1984 predicted would be our oppressors, like big brother, and what actually is our oppressors, which looks more like Brave New World, which is just we\u2019re kind of, like the title of the book, amusing ourselves to death. We\u2019re so caught up in distractions and pleasure and entertainment that we might be missing out on the bigger things. So just like it took the world 100 years to develop antibodies to an addictive technology like tobacco and cigarettes, I think the world needs to develop antibodies to technology addiction and the addiction of really engaging experiences. Nathan Aaron says: With all these web development boot camps opening up, is a future demand for web developers still high or stagnating? I\u2019ve actually been really impressed with some of the boot camps, especially in contrast to how prepared people coming out of these boot camps are compared to people coming out of four-year universities or colleges. So I think that universities and colleges need to really up their game and adapt if they\u2019re still going to be something that people think is a good investment. Just a tip for people who are going through or thinking about going through one of those hack camps or things, the thing that I still see \u2013 I was actually looking at it the other day. I\u2019ve reviewed 22,000 applications and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to Automattic in the past three years. So I look at a lot of these. All the web development, web boot camp ones seem to follow a little bit of a template. So see if you can break out of that a little bit. But also even though you might do projects as part of that, the thing missing is often just a little more experience. And you say, well, I don\u2019t have a job yet, how do I get experience? Open source! Contribute to open source. Get involved with the open source project. It\u2019s something that I think would \u2013 because you\u2019re competing with folks who maybe have three or four years at Google or Facebook and things like that. You might be just as good from a development point of view, but you need to get some of that experience in. So the hack, the cool shortcut there is get involved with the open source project. Or start one and show sort of real world users, real world collaboration with other people. I don\u2019t think I talked about that earlier in the things I look for. But the most brilliant person in the world, the greatest developer, the greatest anything that can\u2019t work with other people is basically not ever going to have an impact and honestly, someone I would let go of Automattic. It doesn\u2019t matter how great you are, if you\u2019re not going to be able to work within the context of the team, it\u2019s not someone who I want to work with personally. So being able to show that in your application I think is really key. The growth for web developers I think is going to grow hugely, but it\u2019ll also become more sophisticated. Even think about pre- in the \u201890s, before something like WordPress. You might need to call your web developer every time you wanted to change your website. Now tools like WordPress make it easy for you to do that all day long without talking to anyone. So the basics are going to get easier and easier because the software will enable people to do that. So what they need developers for is we\u2019re going to become more sophisticated. I talked about earlier that at WordPress you can start and make a great site. If you\u2019re going to use WooCommerce, you can definitely get started with it, but maybe to customize it how you want, you need a developer. So that\u2019s where the demand for developers is growing. So you need to become more and more sophisticated as the general world becomes more sophisticated. We\u2019ve got Tom, Tron Ammon: Considering the heights you\u2019ve reached, how do you motivate yourself on a daily basis over the course of any projects? You know, I\u2019m actually really lucky. I just got two awards in the past few weeks. One was a Fortune 40 Under 40, which I guess is a recognition, not an award. The other was the Heinz Award, which I\u2019m really super honored by. It\u2019s kind of like the MacArthur genius grant or something. The pick five people for year in different areas and it comes with a $250,000 grant. It\u2019s a huge honor. I\u2019m even blown away that I was considered for it. So to win it was very humbling. But when these things happen, when this recognition comes in or a height you\u2019ve reached, this is a new height I\u2019ve reached, if anything, it makes me work harder. Because I don\u2019t want to let down the people who chose this. Expectations are that much higher for what I need to do. If the world has given me something, I want to give it back ten times that. So I would say that success can actually be very motivating to not let the world down in terms of you\u2019ve been lucky, it\u2019s blessed you. How do you give it back? How do you pay it forward? It\u2019s not just being more successful. It\u2019s also literally how do you give it back? How do you put goodness into the world? How do you give it away? That\u2019s really key to balance an importance. If I have something, I would just give a little tip. When I have a grind, like I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve reviewed 22,000 applications. There\u2019s about 600 waiting in the queue right now I need to look at. With something that is a long task I know is going to take a few hours that I need to get through, I have them break it up using the Pomodoro technique. Sometimes I do 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. Sometimes I\u2019ll actually do a longer version, where I do sort of 50 to 55 minutes on and then 10 minutes off, because I find that I can really stay in the flow for a longer period of time if I have the right music on and everything like that. So that is something I use to get through a grind when maybe I don\u2019t have that motivation because let\u2019s be honest, no one, including myself, wakes up every morning of every single day being like, ah great! Sometimes you wake up those mornings, maybe you mixed your alcohols like I talked about earlier, and you just don\u2019t want to do anything. But something like a Pomodoro technique or forcing yourself to stare at the blank page and just typing gibberish or whatever it is to kind of get the engine started can just help it on those days when you have no motivation, which happen more frequently than any of us would care to admit. Brian Kapp asked: What has been the biggest technical problem you\u2019ve had to overcome and how did you end up solving it? This was an interesting one because as I thought about it, all the all the technical problems that I\u2019ve faced in my career in terms of like a really difficult bit of code or an upgrade, path or bringing in WYSIWYG to WordPress or any of these sort of things, are fundamentally tractable. Meaning that you can essentially chip away at it enough that they\u2019re solvable. Or you get the right people involved or whatever it is. They\u2019ve certainly been fun ones. There\u2019s a great presentation by a WordPress contributor, Andrew Nacin. He talks about when we added emoji support into WordPress, it was actually kind of a behind-the-scenes way. We had found a really key security problems in an underlying database, which was MySQL, that affects not just us, but everyone out there in the way that we deal with multi-byte characters. So this is kind of technical, but normal ASCII text is represented by a single byte and Unicode, which is the system which allows representing every language in the world and also things like emoji, are multi-byte, so they might be two or four bytes long. There was just a really obscure bug that allowed you to essentially do some security exploits by changing how multiple-byte characters were truncated and anyway, it was honestly a ton of fun, really cool. But because the vulnerability was so widespread, including not just WordPress, is we wanted to give people a chance to upgrade before then. So what we framed as emoji support was actually this Unicode fix, essentially. Which was funny because we got a lot of criticism. People were like, \u201cWhy are you putting emojis in when there\u2019s bigger things to work on?\u201d Little did they know. So if you\u2019re a super geek and if anything I just said made sense or seemed interesting, check out Nacin\u2019s presentation there. You\u2019ll enjoy it. But when I think of biggest problems, it\u2019s always the people. I talked about WYSIWYG earlier. When we brought in the WYSIWYG editing to WordPress, which now seems like a very non-controversial feature, at the time it was very controversial. The people side of it was way more difficult than navigating the technical side. The fact that I studied political science in college I think has been way more useful to me than if I had done computer science, because anything, and it\u2019s applicable not just to technology, but anything is about people working together. So learning how to manage, learning how to communicate, all of those skills are the things that kind of go to some other questions like what would you take with you? Or what would you tell your other self? Or if you were doing something else? For me, that\u2019s the skill which I think I\u2019m going to use the rest of my life and continue to grow and develop the rest of my life. It\u2019s not any language I know today or any field, knowledge expertise or domain expertise. It\u2019s just that working with other human beings and becoming better at it. Which is the thing I probably, especially as CEO, I think about and try to work on every day, is kind of the fun part, right? Because you think about it, most all fun activities involve at least one other person. So if you can interact better with other humans, life gets better. The final question as we end up, about one hour into this, from Cesare Roki, \u201cWhat is your evening routine (if you have one)?\u201d This is a cool one and I like Cesare, that you put in the \u201cif you have one,\u201d because this is where I\u2019ll just be open and honest and vulnerable. I\u2019d like to say that I have a cool evening routine. The reality is that for whatever reason, the way that I currently work right now and live is that I kind of go until the gas tank is empty. Whether that\u2019s working, whether that\u2019s with friends or whatever. Then I, within a short period of time, run out of gas and I just fall asleep. I\u2019ve been very fortunate that I\u2019ve never had trouble sleeping. My head hits the pillows and people [inaudible]. They laugh at this. They\u2019re like, \u201cLiterally, your head hit the pillow, 20 seconds later you were asleep,\u201d maybe snoring, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat just happened? You were talking just seconds ago.\u201d This literally happened last night. I had four or five friends over. The conversation was going great. I didn\u2019t want to stop them. So I said, \u201cHey, keep going.\u201d But yesterday I had to wake up at like 4:00 a.m. to catch another flight and get some work in and some meetings and things. So I was just done, even though it was just 10:00 or 11:00. So I said, \u201cHey, keep going. I\u2019ve got to peace out.\u201d If it had been a big party, I would have done the Irish goodbye, where you just kind of leave without talking to anyone. There was just four of us, so I said, \u201cHey, keep going.\u201d I fell asleep as they were still having a great time. I kind of hit the end of the road. So that\u2019s my evening routine, is passing out. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s super useful, but I have thought a lot about morning routine. This is the latest iteration, which I think I\u2019ve talked about before, but this is the latest. I still use coach.me, which is the app where you can check things off every day. It\u2019s like a daily to-do list. The things I try to do every single morning are: I try to do reading in the morning, at least 30 minutes of reading because I find that\u2019s the time of the day where I am the most engaged. After that is I take my vitamins and pills. So that\u2019s Elysium, which is \u2013 well, you can just Google it. I take some of the Nootrobox ones, so like Rise and Kado. And then just some other stuff, whatever Tim has me taking at that time. So like some Ubiquinol, ginseng, whatever it is. Honestly, I didn\u2019t use to care about this stuff as much. Now that I\u2019m in my 30s, I figure it can\u2019t hurt, it might help and I\u2019ll do whatever Tim\u2019s saying most recently. I try to do a little bit of exercise, so right now it\u2019s plank. I do a plank first, then I do squats, then I do push-ups, then I do some sun salutations to kind of stretch things out. Again, I\u2019m not super into yoga, but I do a few sun salutations every single day. It\u2019s amazing. Finally, I meditate for at least ten minutes. I use an app for that called Calm \u2013 C-A-L-M. Then I look at my computer. I try to do a blog post at least four or five days out of the week. So essentially you could translate this into writing. That, I would say, is my perfect morning. Now how many mornings do I hit all \u2013 there\u2019s three, six, eight of those things? Not all of them? Fewer than I would care to admit. But to me, that has been the current recipe for a thing that just works the best. So on that note, I will leave all of the amazing Tim podcast listeners. We all are a super cool group. I am excited and honored and thank you to Tim for allowing me to connect with y\u2019all again. I can\u2019t wait to see the comments and tweets and everything that come out of this. So I\u2019m happy to engage with y\u2019all. Again, I\u2019m Matt Mullenweg. My Twitter is @photomatt, P-H-O-T-O-M-A-T-T. You can see my blogging at matt.blog or at ma.tt. and I\u2019m on Facebook as well.

lot\u2019s changed for me and the company", "when i was last coming to you all to a conversation with tim filled with much tequila, wordpress was about 23 percent of the internet", "we\u2019ve gone up to about 26.5 percent, which i\u2019m really happy about", "my company automattic has changed a lot in that time, too", "we were about 300 people when i last spoke to tim and we actually just this week passed 500", "so things have grown a lot", "but i am excited to be checking out some of these questions you sent and that tim and adam compiled", "so i guess let\u2019s go ahead and dive in", "all righty", "let\u2019s start from steve rubell", "he asked: what\u2019s the hardest part about running a company with a distributed workforce", "one that perhaps others don\u2019t fully consider when trying the same", "hmm", "you know, a lot of the how-to and technical sort of logistics, the tactics of running a distributed company, i think are getting better and better", "we use zoom for video conferencing and slack for chats; p2s on wordpress instead of email", "google apps are really good", "so a lot of the basic tools are out there and they\u2019re getting better every day", "in terms of being able to communicate certainly with one person, you can do that extremely at high fidelity almost instantly from wherever you are in the world with an internet connection", "i think there\u2019s still challenges in terms of getting a group of people on the same page", "however, i don\u2019t perceive those challenges to be that much different from what people who work in the same office have", "so i talk to friends with startups of a similar size to automattic \u2013 you know, 400 or 500 people", "they\u2019re typically spread across a couple floors in a building or a campus", "they talk about how they have to repeat themselves a lot and sort of really hone in messages and do town halls and all these sorts of things that get everyone in the company on the same page", "so i think that just might be something difficult about groups or scaling organizations", "that as soon as it goes above what can be in one or a couple people\u2019s heads, there\u2019s a drift that happens between how different people imagine what a goal is", "the thing i found best for that, even though it wasn\u2019t your question, is to have some sort of prototypes or mockups, or there\u2019s an amazon thing when they\u2019re starting a new project, they write the press release for it", "or i would call it, write the blog post for it", "so write what the announcement will look like when you tell the world about this", "so techniques in that low-fidelity mockups can really help make sure everyone\u2019s thinking about the same thing when you use the same words, which is surprisingly difficult", "finally, the thing that i\u2019ll say is hard about distributed that\u2019s not talked about that i think i uniquely appreciate right now because once a year the entire company of automattic comes together", "we call is our \u201cgrand meetup,\u201d as opposed to the normal meetups which teams do individually and are usually like five to ten people", "the grand meetup we bring the whole company and this year it was in whistler, british columbia, up in canada", "so we had about 460 people out of the 500 there", "it was incredible", "it\u2019s pretty much my favorite week of the year", "people are so different and everyone\u2019s weird in their own ways and unique and has crazy hobbies", "a couple days before, i actually did overlanding with two colleagues across from calgary to whistler, so we were off-road and doing crazy things in jeeps", "then there\u2019s a band where people play together", "everyone gives flash talks, so little miniature five-minute talks about a topic they\u2019re interested in", "so the aftermath of that is that i think the thing about being distributed is that it can be a little lonely", "i really love my colleagues", "i love spending time with them, i love learning about them, and i love talking to them", "it\u2019s true that in person is still the best way to connect with someone", "virtual has gotten better, but there\u2019s so many more sense that are engaged in ways you can read people and you can share a drink or break bread or share food", "when you\u2019re in person, we don\u2019t have virtual equivalence for it yet", "so i think that\u2019s one of the hardest things, assuming you like your colleagues", "you miss them and it can be a bit lonely", "so one thing i always encourage, especially when younger folks maybe straight out of college join automattic is to make sure you have a good social work outside of work because sometimes we default to getting that human connection and that engagement from our colleagues", "that\u2019s not a bad thing at all", "i\u2019m a little jealous of folks who go to an office every day with awesome people who get to do that", "but when you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s important to develop that social network outside of it", "and so that\u2019s one of the reasons i love hanging with tim or other friends in san francisco when i\u2019m there", "when i\u2019m in houston, it\u2019s a lot of my friends from high school and family", "so making sure you have that social layer to support you and keep you connected with the world so you don\u2019t become a weird hermit", "all right", "next question", "jeffrey mcleod: now that you have many hours of travel and work under your belt, what used to be an annoying experience with working on the road that you have adapted to or overcome", "hmm", "so travel-wise, i would say two of the coolest thing you can do as a traveler are, especially if you are a u.s", "citizen, are get pre-check (it\u2019s a total game changer), and i think this is related, there\u2019s a program called global entry that lets you bypass all the customs lines when you\u2019re re-entering the u.s", "not all the customs lines \u2013 all the immigration lines", "you just go straight to this machine that scans your fingerprints and you just breeze on through", "you feel like you\u2019re in the future", "it\u2019s amazing", "so that definitely whenever i go through the pre-check line or the global entry line, i just feel amazing", "i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s totally rational, but it feels really good", "the thing that\u2019s probably changed the most over the few years is just connectivity", "you can have an lte connection in the u.s", "pretty much everywhere", "when i\u2019m international, i use google fi, which is kind of a cellphone service from google that works in over 100 countries", "it\u2019s $10.00 a gigabyte", "or if i\u2019m going to be in a country for a longer period of time, sometimes it\u2019s cheaper to just buy a local sim card", "but once you have that lte connection, you don\u2019t have to worry about wifi anymore because you can tether to a computer", "you don\u2019t have to worry about does the coffee shop i\u2019m in offer this", "or does my hotel have \u2013 i mean, hotels are the worst for wifi", "the more expensive the hotel, the worse it is too", "you could stay in like a motel 6 and they have fast and free wifi and then i\u2019m in like a ritz carlton and they want to charge me $15.00 or $20.00 a day for it and it\u2019s so slow", "so just that mobile connectivity i think has changed because anyplace that i have my backpack and an internet connection, i can be fully productive", "i can have my keyboards, my mice, my headphones, everything and i can work just as if i\u2019m at my desk at home and connect with automatticians and just do my job i have to do as ceo", "so that is the thing that has definitely helped me the most", "i also am constantly updating sort of the kit of what\u2019s in my backpack that is my super hero bag; everything i have", "i do a blog post on this once a year", "if you just search for \u201cmullenweg what\u2019s in my bag,\u201d you\u2019ll see them", "i\u2019m sure tim can link to them in the notes as well", "so that changes every year", "yeah, check that out, check out that blog post", "another one from jeffrey is he says: if you could start from scratch with what you knew know, what part of growth, personal or professional, would you have omitted or asked for more of", "i think on the professional end, i just emphasize that hiring and being thoughtful about hiring is the best way to scale an organization", "i feel like that\u2019s one of the things that to me [inaudible] question what\u2019s your super power", "i don\u2019t actually remember what i said last time, but if i were to answer it today, actually it\u2019s hiring", "i\u2019ve done it now enough and looked at enough r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and everything that \u2013 and we have a process at automattic that tries to remove a lot of the bias from things", "you get the right people around the table and it makes all the difference in the world", "what i would tell my younger self to avoid professionally is probably \u2013 it sounds a little tricky", "so oh, that\u2019s one thing i forgot", "after the podcast with tim and before now, automattic ended up doing another round of funding", "we raised about $160 million", "maybe that was before; i don\u2019t recall exactly", "so that funding has really transformed the areas that we\u2019re able to move into, the things we\u2019re able to work on", "i think previous points in automattic\u2019s history we were capital constrained and that held back our growth, the growth of automattic [inaudible]", "the other thing that i\u2019ve really been learning a lot that i would tell my younger self is the thing about marketing", "i\u2019ve always been kind of like a \u201cif you build it they will come.\u201d to be honest, for most of my career, that\u2019s worked", "i\u2019m now starting to appreciate more and more how marketing and getting your message out there in the right way, it wasn\u2019t that wordpress didn\u2019t do it before, it\u2019s that we did a lot of it and didn\u2019t really think about it", "we kind of lucked our way into it", "i think being systematic in approaching that with as much care as you would to pixels and the design or how an interface works or how the architecture of the code is really crucial to a great product", "it\u2019s one of those fundamental tenets and bases of a product that resonates with lots of people", "on the personal life, i\u2019d probably tell myself to start meditating more", "all the basic stuff: meditate, exercise, eat well, boring stuff i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard on every single podcast tim has done", "more on the personal side, i would say that learning to be vulnerable and sensitive was something that, especially when i was younger, i was just like \u201cgo to the world and show no weakness.\u201d because i was young and i was often operating with people who were decades older than me or getting investment", "i thought i had to be invincible or put on this air of invincibility", "of course, no one is invincible", "as a leader and actually through meditation, i\u2019ve become a lot more empathetic", "part of that isn\u2019t just understanding and feeling other people\u2019s emotions, but being willing to show your own weaknesses and emotions and be vulnerable", "i think it\u2019s brene brown\u2019s book, daring greatly, talks about this really well", "or krista tippett on becoming wise, another great book", "i\u2019ll just leave it at that", "those are some good areas for listeners of the podcast who have maybe done all the stuff from four-hour body and four-hour workweek and are thinking about growing their soul more", "it might be some good avenues to investigate", "james clamaut asked: what\u2019s the most important skillset for an entrepreneur to develop and what characteristics do you look for when recruiting new employees", "there\u2019s another question that i think is a little related to this", "neil harris demarhos says: what are some skills you look for in non-technical people", "so i\u2019m going to tie that into the recruiting question", "so important skills for an entrepreneur to develop: resilience, a balance where you can maintain your health, both mental and physical, while working really, really, really hard, and exactly what i just talked about, empathy", "actually just yesterday i saw an amazing presentation from julia hartz, who is the ceo of eventbrite, where she really spoke about this as a lesson that\u2019s she\u2019s learned over the past few years where being vulnerable and showing empathy is one of the things that\u2019s helped her most as a ceo, which is counterintuitive", "so i\u2019d say those skills are very important", "also, just the basics", "if you\u2019re an entrepreneur, learn about term sheets, learn about preferences, learn about all the mechanics of your business", "know enough accounting that you can talk to your accountant", "know enough development that you can talk to your developers", "know enough marketing that you can talk to your marketers", "you have to know at least a bit about really every part of your business, because that\u2019ll allow you to hire and recruit people that really understand it", "of course, you want them to understand it way better than you, but by having even just a common vocabulary that you can converse with that person in, you\u2019ll be able to operate with them at a much higher level than if you were just a complete novice in their given area of expertise", "by the way, you can also have them teach you", "it\u2019s an amazing way to grow these skills", "i rely on our ops team at automattic very heavily", "i think that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve been really lucky about", "everything with hr and finance and legal and everything", "they\u2019re just super top-notch and i both learn a ton from them and don\u2019t have to worry about that, which has been amazing", "so the characteristics you look for in recruiting new employees and what do you look for in non-technical people question", "the saying is from a basketball guy and he was like, \u201cyou can\u2019t coach tall.\u201d so four of the qualities i look for are the things that you can\u2019t really teach", "that\u2019s work ethic, taste, integrity and curiosity", "if you think about all of those, if someone has those four things: work ethic, taste, integrity and curiosity, i believe that you can learn pretty much anything in the world", "if you look at any expert, this is something that i think is good to remember", "if you look at elon musk on space rockets or tim on health and fitness, well, all the things tim\u2019s an expert on, or any of these different areas, remember at one point that person knew nothing about it", "we\u2019re all born, we all learn and so i really do truly believe that you can become an expert in any field if you put in the hours and the work and the practice and everything", "if someone has those four things, i know that they will be able to rise to whatever the job and role requires of them", "of course, we look for experience and such in order to shortcut that process a little bit", "but i also know that for every person i hire at automattic, what we\u2019re doing today and what they\u2019re hired for is likely not what we\u2019re going to be doing 5 or 10 and certainly not 20 or 30 years from now", "when we hire, i do it with the expectation that someone\u2019s going to be at the company for decades to come", "it\u2019s not just a short stint, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really a long-term relationship", "it\u2019s like getting married", "i think about not just where they are today, but how will they adapt when the company changes and when the world changes and when we\u2019re all in the singularity", "so those sort of intrinsic and tough-to-teach things become more and more important", "next question", "this comes from rock m", "fard: if wordpress is the platform of writing and shopify is of commerce, are there other similar platforms you think are worth developing", "that\u2019s a good question", "there are a few areas that i think are sort of like fundamentals for interaction on the web that there aren\u2019t great open source tools for yet", "or, in some cases, good tools in general", "one area that\u2019s getting a ton of investment now that even though there aren\u2019t perfect source things, i think we\u2019re in a pretty good place is just messaging", "so between slack and facebook is making messenger, telegram, whatsapp, messaging built into platforms like instagram and all of this, i feel like the communication side of things is being pretty well invested", "but then when you think about how communication happens online, there\u2019s still so much to do there", "so, for example, we actually have something we\u2019re reviving a little bit called \u201cblicki,\u201d which is the combination of a blog and a wiki", "basically, the idea is that wikis are pretty cool, but you lose when you have everyone being able to edit everything", "you lose some of the elements of moderation or curation that make many websites great", "so a blicki is essentially something in between", "it\u2019s a moderated wiki", "so anyone can edit it, but the edits go through a moderation queue, much like the comments on wordpress go through a moderation queue that can be accepted or denied", "so you can get the best of both worlds of community participation and the curation and editorial direction that comes from great websites and blogs", "so i think wikis are an area that need some innovation", "forums as well", "forums are so much fun", "i learned a lot of what i\u2019ve done and had lots of great conversations on forums", "i know tim has as well", "i know it\u2019s kind of one of these things that forums aren\u2019t really sexy, so no one talks about them or looks at them", "we have a product called bbpress there that we use for the support forums on wordpress that are on wordpress.com and it\u2019s used by some other folks", "that\u2019s definitely an area i\u2019d like to invest more into and i think that needs better platforms for", "you mentioned commerce and shopify", "shopify is an incredible tool", "commerce is actually an area we\u2019ve moved into", "we did an acquisition of a platform called woocommerce, which is built on top of wordpress", "i think that commerce \u2013 for many ways, commerce is where blogging was in 2007, 2008, where there\u2019s some great hosted tools and some great open source tools like woocommerce", "but if you want to use woocommerce, you probably need to be a little more tech savvy or have a developer", "we\u2019re entering the area much like where wordpress was in 2008, where we\u2019re starting to make it so anyone can use the software, so you get kind of the best of the ease of use of other platforms, but the flexibility of having complete control over your domain, the code, everything", "you can customize it", "i think that\u2019s a winning combination", "i hope that over the next couple of years, woocommerce can live up to its fantastic competitors in the marketplace, including shopify, ecwid, bigcommerce, etc", "finally, you said we\u2019re the platform of writing and i\u2019m very flattered there, but still with blogging, and especially with comments, i think there\u2019s so much more to do", "you just got me really excited to get back to work", "i almost want to stop the podcast and go talk to some teams around wordpress and automattic", "so that was a good question", "the toughest thing that i deal with day to day is a lot of the stuff i just talked about, outside of woo, which we\u2019re making huge investments in", "our ideas we had, sometimes even five or ten years ago that because our opportunities with our main business lines, which are wordpress, jetpack and woocommerce, are so much that it\u2019s tough; we have to focus in on them", "there were years, and maybe this goes back to something i would tell my earlier self professionally", "so in the early years of automattic we deluded ourselves", "we spread ourselves too thin", "so we really had to say no to a lot", "that\u2019s how i understand that famous steve jobs or johnny ives line, like \u201ca great product is saying no to a thousand things.\u201d i used to think that was a thousand buttons and you say no to 999 of them", "i think now it resonates with me more saying that in addition to these things we\u2019re focused on, there\u2019s 999 other things that we\u2019d love to be working on", "areas i\u2019d love to tackle", "it\u2019s really saying no to even just the future of the product, but to working on other products entirely", "some other things that makes me excited about \u2013 scaling automattic from 500 people today to 5,000 in the future \u2013 is that we can do our core areas really well and make sure that those continue to be the best in the world, but also it spans the breadth of what we work on", "all right", "next question", "this is from, i\u2019m going to say jocko timmonen", "i apologize for everyone\u2019s names", "i\u2019m doing my best to pronounce them.\u00a0send me a tweet or something afterwards that i could do it better", "he says, and this actually relates to the say no to 999 things: what has been the most important default setting in you that you\u2019ve later questioned and removed?\u00a0by default setting, i mean a value or behavior that\u2019s been hardwired by parents, environment, education, or society", "i think it\u2019s almost just more than a specific default setting, which i probably have some things i do difficulty", "i type the dvorak layout instead of the qwerty layout", "or just living distributed versus living in a home or being in one place or building companies in a different way", "it\u2019s just the fact that you\u2019re constantly looking at default settings", "so i\u2019d say, jocko, by this question, you\u2019re probably thinking about it the right way because my default settings and the way i grew up in society and everything like that is going to be different from yours", "so the things that need to change will be different and our situations are different", "so what you should think about is just asking yourself that question at various intervals", "this is why i love the christmas/new year\u2019s time, because it forces you to take a step back and look from the 10,000 feet view", "but i try to do this \u2013 it\u2019s actually something that happens a lot when i\u2019m trying to meditate and i can\u2019t quiet my mind and i\u2019m thinking of lots of things", "sometimes i\u2019ll just take a pause and be like okay, i\u2019m just going to not meditate, but also not do anything, not look at my phone, not do anything", "have a piece of paper and just try to see everything that\u2019s caught up in my mind and where do i think that\u2019s going, how do i think it\u2019s \u2013 sort of unwind my mind in terms of what\u2019s stuck in there and what are the things i\u2019m thinking about", "and that often leads me to take that step back from the day to day and look at things from a broader sense", "is my life heading in the right direction", "are my relationships in the right place", "who are the people that i love and care about but maybe haven\u2019t spoken to in a few weeks or a few months or maybe even all year", "so those sort of steps back i think cause you to look at your own operating system", "actually, something that i think meditation is great for is almost like an interrupt", "i read a cool book called, i think it\u2019s called search within yourself", "it\u2019s a fellow at google that started, i think it\u2019s even called search within yourself meditation and mindfulness program", "i believe his name was jade ming tong", "he kind of has an engineering background and also a googler, so the book i think is pretty cool for leaders of companies because it talks about the business benefits of mindfulness", "from an engineering point of view, how mindfulness and meditation is almost like a background process that runs and whenever your operating system throws up like an interrupt like a reaction or emotion to things, it can kind of catch that", "so before you immediately react and do the thing that would be sort of your first intuition or reaction to an emotion or a thought, it says, hey, wait a second", "that\u2019s essentially the muscle you\u2019ve developing when you meditate", "when i started thinking of it that way, i was like, wow, okay", "so just like i might do a plank or pushups or something like, i need to work this muscle every day if i can", "i think it\u2019s impossible to do that and not think about your default settings or go back to the first principles of why you do things, the reason why you got into what you in the first place", "are you truly happy", "these are tough questions, but ones that you can honestly, with the distraction of day-to-day life and our phones and our blogs and our social media, it is so easy to just be lost minute to minute and be busy all day and not really bring yourself closer to the mountain that you want to climb", "i would say if you are listening right now, maybe even pause and just take ten minutes, whether you\u2019re driving in the car or whatever you\u2019re doing, just pause the podcast and do nothing", "have zero inputs and just think about that", "all right", "i guess we\u2019re back now", "next question is from matthew arnold: hard work in and of itself does not seem to guaranty success", "it\u2019s true", "there are plenty of truly hard working entrepreneurs who businesses will fail", "to what other factors besides hard work do you attribute your massive success in business", "luck, good mentors, timing", "all right, matthew \u2013 which is an awesome name \u2013 thank you for that question", "i think it\u2019s definitely all \u2013 it\u2019s funny that when people call me successful, i don\u2019t think of myself as that way", "i think part of that, even though i know objectively by many measures i have been and i\u2019ve been extraordinarily fortunate and lucky and everything", "but part of it\u2019s because i fail so often", "so i don\u2019t think that yes, if ten businesses were started today, nine of them would fail", "by the way, including if i did them", "so it\u2019s not how many times you fall, it\u2019s how many times you get back up is really key", "people talk about resilience and all these things", "so that is true", "even like i think of business icons and the greatest companies of our time", "facebook has products that fail all the time", "they launched poke \u2013 like a snapchat rip-off", "amazon, which i am a huge admirer of jeff bezos", "do you remember the kindle phone", "that was just like last year", "that was a huge failure", "and not just a huge failure like one that they must\u2019ve spent the better part of a billion dollars on", "so we don\u2019t stop failing", "it\u2019s just you want to hopefully design your systems to assume failure and have some back-up plans: a plan b, a plan c, a plan d, all the way to a plan z, so that you\u2019ll be able to get up and fight another day", "just whatever that drives you to do it", "i think having a higher motivation beyond the extrinsic things, which might come from success", "so something more than money, something more than material goods that motivates you is really key and so that\u2019s kind of the thing that i would attribute it to", "especially in business press", "we just see when people hit the home runs", "we don\u2019t see all their at-bats", "very rarely do we even know about all the at-bats they\u2019ve had", "so just remember that", "no matter how bad a day you think you\u2019re having, there\u2019s probably someone you admire who\u2019s probably also having a bad day right this second", "you\u2019re not alone", "next up", "julian bosley: you have 30 minutes before the end of the world and you find yourself in a very well-stocked bar next to an amazingly varied delicatessen", "what choice of food and drink did you enjoy", "i liked this question a lot because well, i love food and drink", "i\u2019m actually on a quest right now to go to all the top 50 restaurants in the world", "there\u2019s a list that gets published i think by pellegrino or sponsored by pellegrino", "i\u2019ve been to 9 of the top 10 and i think about 40, 45 percent of the top 50", "these experiences from these chefs, it\u2019s like a whole out-of-the-world thing, but i love food and drink", "now usually when i\u2019m drinking \u2013 part of why i like this question \u2013 is there\u2019s 30 minutes before the end of the world and generally when i engage in libations, i try to stick to the same alcohol all night", "this is just something i\u2019ve learned from trial and error; mostly error", "when i mix different types of alcohols, i feel kind of terrible", "i heard a saying once that \u201cdrinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.\u201d that\u2019s true to an extent, especially if you mix", "but if i stay with one, you know, if i stay with a great casa dragones all night or wine all night, or whiskey all night \u2013 i\u2019d say those are my three favorites (of course, to a reasonable degree; if you have too much of anything, it\u2019s bad for you) \u2013 i\u2019m typically pretty okay the next day", "but the truth is i love all sorts of different drinks", "there\u2019s great drinks made by gin and rum and other things, like great cocktails that i would love to have but i typically avoid because i don\u2019t want to drink gin all night", "so for the drinking part of things, i would basically have a bunch of everything at the bar and just enjoy it, preferably in some great cocktails", "in terms of a wine, i actually love california wines", "there\u2019s some great, old california wines like an alpha omega or just some of the classics", "for basically the last thing, i\u2019m going to assume this delicatessen has a foie gras and i know this is so bougie, i can\u2019t even believe i\u2019m saying this, but like there\u2019s an experience that foie melts on your tongue and then you wash it down with like a great sauterne, like a ch\u00e2teau d\u2019yquem", "just the best one that the bar has", "it is a party in your mouth", "it\u2019s almost impossible to describe the sensation of what goes on there with those two tastes interacting", "so that would be like 29 minutes and 45 seconds the thing i would have", "then otherwise from the delicatessen, i would probably just go for a couple good sandwiches", "definitely like eggs and cheese and bacon on a croissant is a go-to that always gives me joy", "it\u2019s funny, we\u2019re coming up on thanksgiving and everything thanksgiving, i\u2019m like man, turkey is so good", "why don\u2019t i eat more turkey", "and especially you know those day-after turkey sandwiches where you have the pulled turkey, like the dark meat, and then you get some mayonnaise, cranberry and horseradish and just like kind of mix up the sandwich a lot", "pickles, lots of pickles", "maybe something like, maybe even mix in some sauerkraut or some kimchi, something fermented in there", "that would probably be like my go-to, super good deli sandwich", "julian, thank you, because this question was super fun for me to think about because i really went in a lot of different directions.\u00a0some mixed cocktails, some good wine, and then ending it off with a great sauterne", "all right", "next question", "we\u2019ve got alexander francesco newman: matt, what are your thoughts on artificial intelligence web developer designer tools such as the grid or wix adi", "will wordpress use some sort of ai developer or designer feature in the future", "or just an ai", "this is kind of funny", "i don\u2019t like to talk bad about competitors, so i won\u2019t mention any specifically, but i do think that right now there\u2019s kind of an almost like a completely viscous marketing hype cycle around ai that has nothing to do with artificial intelligence at all", "so people are just slapping \u201cai\u201d on everything, maybe before they slapped \u201ccloud\u201d on stuff", "that just isn\u2019t ai at all", "so i think it\u2019s really just marketing", "nothing i\u2019ve seen in the marketplace so far is much more than vaporware and a good demo", "i do think that essentially what they come down as kind of wizards", "it\u2019s not that different from what a clippy would do in microsoft word in the \u201890s", "so i think there\u2019s much better approaches to that sort of problem", "now, embedded in that is do i think that there\u2019s changes we could make to wordpress that would make it easier for folks to get going or get started", "the thing i think about which is really our biggest challenge and the thing i work on every day, which is how do you connect", "bridge that gap between what someone imagines and what they\u2019re able to create", "so absolutely, that\u2019s what we work on every day", "big parts of automattic work on how do we make it easier and more intuitive to have that effortless flow as you\u2019re building things", "that is at the core of what we do", "in terms of ai and sort of that impacting the business, i think that we\u2019re still a few or many years away from that being more useful than a well-designed, traditional interface", "actually, a really great essay about this \u2013 we\u2019ll find the link for the show notes \u2013 but essentially, there\u2019s a fellow who looked at all the chat bots, which are sort of an area of ai right now", "for messenger, for telegram, there\u2019s these bots and you can say, \u201chey, i want a pizza.\u201d they\u2019re like, \u201cwhat kind of pizza do you want?\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201chmm, how about some pepperoni?\u201d or maybe it\u2019s smart, so it says, \u201chey, you usually get pepperoni", "do you want some pepperoni?\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, let me have some pepperoni", "but oh darn, it\u2019s not my cheat day, so deliver it on saturday instead.\u201d so you sort of have this conversational interface, that sometimes people call ai, with this product or service that you consume or buy or interact with", "basically what this essay does is it compares that model to what a lot of folks in the us are trying to copy, which is the success of platforms like wechat in china", "it shows how these days wechat actually it\u2019s not that you\u2019re purely chatting with someone and asking them, which sounds to me like the inconvenience of calling a restaurant to get a reservation versus using like a reserve or an opentable to just click a few buttons and get one", "wechat really embeds these interfaces", "he talks about the number of taps it takes to chat with a bot to get something versus the taps \u2013 i think maybe he even uses the pizza example \u2013 to order a pizza in china on wechat through this mega-conversational platform", "i think that\u2019s one of the areas where a great interface can still surpass a chat", "one thing that we\u2019re doing \u2013 so i\u2019ll give you all a preview of something we\u2019re working on for wordpress.com \u2013 is we actually are working on a new chat interface", "so we provide for paying customers live chat support", "it\u2019s a great experience", "you\u2019re connected with a real, live human being and they will help you through whatever you\u2019re having trouble with", "so it\u2019s real intelligence", "it\u2019s better than artificial intelligence; they can help you with anything", "there\u2019s some disadvantages to this though in terms of it\u2019s difficult to scale in terms of we\u2019re hiring people as fast as we can and we\u2019re happy with the happiness engineers at automattic, but we want to create tools that enable them to just reach more people", "so we\u2019re working on this new chat system and the two big things it changes are (1) it abstracts out who you\u2019re talking to", "because right now \u2013 and by the way, i do live chat support sometimes too \u2013 so if you\u2019re chatting and you have maybe three or four chats going on simultaneously, you\u2019re helping people, it\u2019s a little bit difficult both to wrap those up, like say you want to go to lunch, but even things like using the restroom", "you don\u2019t want to leave the people you\u2019re chatting with hanging because they\u2019re waiting for you", "so by abstracting it out, so basically you\u2019ll be chatting with an agent or a cartoon character, whatever it is that we decide, instead of a specific person, we can allow transferring of chats between people way easier behind the scenes", "so you could have an \u201ci\u2019m going to the bathroom\u201d button or \u201cmy dog just starting chewing on the couch\u201d button and the chat could be transferred to someone that gets all the transcripts and everything and could just pick it up instantly and keep the chat going, invisibly to the person they\u2019re chatting with", "but (2) is we\u2019re looking at, and this is an area i like way more than artificial intelligence, which is machine learning", "so we now have all of the chats", "i mean, at this point, probably close to a million interactions we\u2019ve done or way more than a million", "emails, chats, everything", "so we can apply \u2013 and i\u2019m going to say a buzzword \u2013 \u201cdeep learning,\u201d which i\u2019m going to say is not totally hype because there\u2019s been some amazing open source tools released by google like tensorflow and all of the technology is actually pretty useful here", "to learn from those and essentially augment the happiness engineers, the people doing support, by when we get something that looks a lot like what we\u2019ve seen before, we can suggest essentially like a pre-reply, like an answer for them that saves them having to type out or do everything", "then they can customize that or use that to augment their ability to chat with folks", "so this has been a pretty cool project in the area where i think ai could actually have a real impact versus just be marketing hype", "hamid fadifar asked: if you hadn\u2019t accomplished what you\u2019ve accomplished and started over with nothing, what would the next six months of your life look like", "this is a pretty trick question because there\u2019s a lot of ways to think about it", "i think the first way i thought about it was, well, if i just lost everything, like i had to declare bankruptcy and had no assets or anything, the obvious thing, i have lots of friends and family, so that\u2019s sort of my safety net", "so i would probably move back in home and start to rebuild from there", "but that\u2019s probably not how you intended it and hopefully, unless the question is, if you don\u2019t have friends and family that you think would take you in if you were having a hard time, develop some deeper relationships, you never know what\u2019s going to happen", "and by the way, that means that you\u2019ll take them in if they\u2019re having hard times", "it\u2019s totally reciprocal", "then there\u2019s the version of this question i\u2019ve seen before, like what if you knew everything you know but you\u2019re homeless one day", "so you lose everything and you don\u2019t have any friends or family you can sort of fall back on", "so you\u2019re kind of alone in the world, but you have all your knowledge", "what would you do", "my answer there again, and this also assumes the privilege of being in the united states and things like that, is i would probably go to the external version of friends and family, which is maybe a church or a ymca or one of the nonprofits that tries to help out people with nothing, and sort of use that as a home base to then develop", "the other version of this that i thought of was well what if instead of all that you have your house, you don\u2019t need to worry about surviving, but you are starting something brand new", "so the thing i would do first here is \u2013 so i know everything i know now \u2013 i would use my craft, engineering or music, essentially get a job", "so i think i would probably look for the most interesting company i could get access to and just do my best to be hired there", "create a really great application", "really craft, learn a lot about their business and go into interviews knowing a ton about it", "try to stand out", "if they say no, keep trying to be hired and really put the \u2013 just to try to get around a great group and have a great job where i know i\u2019ll learn and start to save and develop the net for which i could do something more entrepreneurial in the future if i wanted to, which i think is what you\u2019re getting at with the question", "so i get this job", "there was a saying when i was a musician, \u201cyou never want to be the best musician in the band.\u201d ideally, you\u2019re the worst musician in the band because that means you\u2019re learning from every single person around you", "so i would try to find a company or a group or someplace where i could be the worst musician in the band, where just every single person was so much better than me", "i still made the cut to make it in, but then i would just be learning from everyone around me every day", "if i was just trying to start something new and it couldn\u2019t be related to anything i had done before, so it couldn\u2019t be content management or ecommerce or any of the areas that wordpress kind of plays in, i think what i would try to do is figure out the zeitgeist", "so i would buy a copy of the new yorker and new york magazine and the economist and wired and fast company and i\u2019d just read them cover to cover, maybe for a month or two, maybe get some back issues, and try to figure out what area is in the good part of the hype cycle", "so something like vr or ai is probably in the bad part of the hype cycle where the expectations people have for it are so out of line and we\u2019re just early, too early in terms of the impact that the technology can have", "so i\u2019d try to look for an area that is no longer \u2013 maybe i would go back three or four years on those magazines and look for something that was hot then but no one\u2019s talking about then", "that\u2019s probably where the biggest opportunities are", "so the thing that everyone was excited about five, six, seven years ago; it got a ton of overinvestment and companies have started and failed, and now it\u2019s at that point in the cycle where the real stuff is happening", "like the carpetbaggers and the folks who are in it just for money have all like come and gone and it\u2019s just the people who really want to make a difference in the world are still there are working", "in some ways, i think content management is in this area right now, where a lot of the hype was four or five, six years ago", "but now we\u2019re actually reaching scale and having an impact on hundreds of millions of people\u2019s lives", "that\u2019s where the big opportunity is", "that might be outside of the web \u2013 areas like crispr or gene editing", "some of the bio stuff i think is getting pretty interesting", "we\u2019re approaching times when the devices \u2013 cellphones, some mobile stuff is probably in this area right now where we have more than a billion mobile devices", "no one\u2019s really thinking, i\u2019m going to start an app", "that kind of when it\u2019s most interesting to start an app", "when wordpress started, the biggest criticism was that there are too many blogging systems and the world didn\u2019t need another one", "so that would be what i would try to find", "what do people say the world doesn\u2019t need another one of because there\u2019s plenty of it", "and try it out", "carlos reale: where do you see the future of the internet in terms of user behaviors, given that 20 years ago people started to use and visit websites", "now most people just use their phones and when vr becomes useful, it\u2019s like we\u2019ll all live on a vr platform and the phone will fall like the desktop", "hmm", "so my hope is that phones don\u2019t fall like the desktop because even in a world where the vr is super amazing and we\u2019ll all be plugged into the matrix, i still really hope that i can go on a hike with tim", "or get out in the world and see some of the beautiful things all around us in nature and in cities and in instruments live and concerts and things like that", "so when i\u2019m mobile, something like a phone will hopefully be on me and i hope that\u2019s still there", "so in terms of the internet, i think the behavior that\u2019s changing the most is still just this megatrend that we\u2019re still riding where there\u2019s six billion people still coming online", "so everything that we think is amazing and huge and big now is going to 6x or more likely 10 or 100x where it is in terms of user interaction, in terms of posts per day, in terms of number of people tweeting", "all of this is going to be so, so, so much bigger than even the already amazing levels it has reached", "as people become more comfortable being native online, the same cycles that people listening to this podcast might remember about 15 years ago where you were nervous to put your credit card online or things like that", "folks coming online for the first time are going to have those same nervousness and go through the same, hopefully accelerated, learning process of what\u2019s it like to truly live digitally and live online", "so i think that will be adopted faster", "i also hope that payments will be an area we can have a lot of innovation on because the friction of payments i think puts us in business models like advertising right now, which aren\u2019t the best", "how cool would it be that everyone listening to this could give \u2013 instead of tim having advertising or doing whatever he needs to do, everyone listening to this could just put in a dollar or maybe even not a dollar, maybe put in like two pennies, some sort of micropayments that could support creators all over the world", "like right now, the payment systems that we have just aren\u2019t set up for that, but i could imagine something like that being really cool in the future", "the thing that i think is going to have to change user behavior-wise is we need to develop more antibodies, more immunity", "because the technology is going to get better and better and better at engaging us", "machine learning", "and in the future 20 years from now, when we do have something more approaching artificial intelligence, could entertain us perfectly and keep us always connected and engaged with whatever companies want us to be engaged with", "because a lot of this will be commercially drive", "so that worries me a little bit", "it\u2019s a little more brave new world, 1984", "it reminds me of that great intro to brave new world", "no, it\u2019s neil postman", "i think he wrote a book called amusing ourselves to death", "there was an intro", "we\u2019ll put it in the show notes", "that\u2019s the one made into a comic that was pretty amazing in terms of what 1984 predicted would be our oppressors, like big brother, and what actually is our oppressors, which looks more like brave new world, which is just we\u2019re kind of, like the title of the book, amusing ourselves to death", "we\u2019re so caught up in distractions and pleasure and entertainment that we might be missing out on the bigger things", "so just like it took the world 100 years to develop antibodies to an addictive technology like tobacco and cigarettes, i think the world needs to develop antibodies to technology addiction and the addiction of really engaging experiences", "nathan aaron says: with all these web development boot camps opening up, is a future demand for web developers still high or stagnating", "i\u2019ve actually been really impressed with some of the boot camps, especially in contrast to how prepared people coming out of these boot camps are compared to people coming out of four-year universities or colleges", "so i think that universities and colleges need to really up their game and adapt if they\u2019re still going to be something that people think is a good investment", "just a tip for people who are going through or thinking about going through one of those hack camps or things, the thing that i still see \u2013 i was actually looking at it the other day", "i\u2019ve reviewed 22,000 applications and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to automattic in the past three years", "so i look at a lot of these", "all the web development, web boot camp ones seem to follow a little bit of a template", "so see if you can break out of that a little bit", "but also even though you might do projects as part of that, the thing missing is often just a little more experience", "and you say, well, i don\u2019t have a job yet, how do i get experience", "open source", "contribute to open source", "get involved with the open source project", "it\u2019s something that i think would \u2013 because you\u2019re competing with folks who maybe have three or four years at google or facebook and things like that", "you might be just as good from a development point of view, but you need to get some of that experience in", "so the hack, the cool shortcut there is get involved with the open source project", "or start one and show sort of real world users, real world collaboration with other people", "i don\u2019t think i talked about that earlier in the things i look for", "but the most brilliant person in the world, the greatest developer, the greatest anything that can\u2019t work with other people is basically not ever going to have an impact and honestly, someone i would let go of automattic", "it doesn\u2019t matter how great you are, if you\u2019re not going to be able to work within the context of the team, it\u2019s not someone who i want to work with personally", "so being able to show that in your application i think is really key", "the growth for web developers i think is going to grow hugely, but it\u2019ll also become more sophisticated", "even think about pre- in the \u201890s, before something like wordpress", "you might need to call your web developer every time you wanted to change your website", "now tools like wordpress make it easy for you to do that all day long without talking to anyone", "so the basics are going to get easier and easier because the software will enable people to do that", "so what they need developers for is we\u2019re going to become more sophisticated", "i talked about earlier that at wordpress you can start and make a great site", "if you\u2019re going to use woocommerce, you can definitely get started with it, but maybe to customize it how you want, you need a developer", "so that\u2019s where the demand for developers is growing", "so you need to become more and more sophisticated as the general world becomes more sophisticated", "we\u2019ve got tom, tron ammon: considering the heights you\u2019ve reached, how do you motivate yourself on a daily basis over the course of any projects", "you know, i\u2019m actually really lucky", "i just got two awards in the past few weeks", "one was a fortune 40 under 40, which i guess is a recognition, not an award", "the other was the heinz award, which i\u2019m really super honored by", "it\u2019s kind of like the macarthur genius grant or something", "the pick five people for year in different areas and it comes with a $250,000 grant", "it\u2019s a huge honor", "i\u2019m even blown away that i was considered for it", "so to win it was very humbling", "but when these things happen, when this recognition comes in or a height you\u2019ve reached, this is a new height i\u2019ve reached, if anything, it makes me work harder", "because i don\u2019t want to let down the people who chose this", "expectations are that much higher for what i need to do", "if the world has given me something, i want to give it back ten times that", "so i would say that success can actually be very motivating to not let the world down in terms of you\u2019ve been lucky, it\u2019s blessed you", "how do you give it back", "how do you pay it forward", "it\u2019s not just being more successful", "it\u2019s also literally how do you give it back", "how do you put goodness into the world", "how do you give it away", "that\u2019s really key to balance an importance", "if i have something, i would just give a little tip", "when i have a grind, like i\u2019ve said, i\u2019ve reviewed 22,000 applications", "there\u2019s about 600 waiting in the queue right now i need to look at", "with something that is a long task i know is going to take a few hours that i need to get through, i have them break it up using the pomodoro technique", "sometimes i do 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off", "sometimes i\u2019ll actually do a longer version, where i do sort of 50 to 55 minutes on and then 10 minutes off, because i find that i can really stay in the flow for a longer period of time if i have the right music on and everything like that", "so that is something i use to get through a grind when maybe i don\u2019t have that motivation because let\u2019s be honest, no one, including myself, wakes up every morning of every single day being like, ah great", "sometimes you wake up those mornings, maybe you mixed your alcohols like i talked about earlier, and you just don\u2019t want to do anything", "but something like a pomodoro technique or forcing yourself to stare at the blank page and just typing gibberish or whatever it is to kind of get the engine started can just help it on those days when you have no motivation, which happen more frequently than any of us would care to admit", "brian kapp asked: what has been the biggest technical problem you\u2019ve had to overcome and how did you end up solving it", "this was an interesting one because as i thought about it, all the all the technical problems that i\u2019ve faced in my career in terms of like a really difficult bit of code or an upgrade, path or bringing in wysiwyg to wordpress or any of these sort of things, are fundamentally tractable", "meaning that you can essentially chip away at it enough that they\u2019re solvable", "or you get the right people involved or whatever it is", "they\u2019ve certainly been fun ones", "there\u2019s a great presentation by a wordpress contributor, andrew nacin", "he talks about when we added emoji support into wordpress, it was actually kind of a behind-the-scenes way", "we had found a really key security problems in an underlying database, which was mysql, that affects not just us, but everyone out there in the way that we deal with multi-byte characters", "so this is kind of technical, but normal ascii text is represented by a single byte and unicode, which is the system which allows representing every language in the world and also things like emoji, are multi-byte, so they might be two or four bytes long", "there was just a really obscure bug that allowed you to essentially do some security exploits by changing how multiple-byte characters were truncated and anyway, it was honestly a ton of fun, really cool", "but because the vulnerability was so widespread, including not just wordpress, is we wanted to give people a chance to upgrade before then", "so what we framed as emoji support was actually this unicode fix, essentially", "which was funny because we got a lot of criticism", "people were like, \u201cwhy are you putting emojis in when there\u2019s bigger things to work on?\u201d little did they know", "so if you\u2019re a super geek and if anything i just said made sense or seemed interesting, check out nacin\u2019s presentation there", "you\u2019ll enjoy it", "but when i think of biggest problems, it\u2019s always the people", "i talked about wysiwyg earlier", "when we brought in the wysiwyg editing to wordpress, which now seems like a very non-controversial feature, at the time it was very controversial", "the people side of it was way more difficult than navigating the technical side", "the fact that i studied political science in college i think has been way more useful to me than if i had done computer science, because anything, and it\u2019s applicable not just to technology, but anything is about people working together", "so learning how to manage, learning how to communicate, all of those skills are the things that kind of go to some other questions like what would you take with you", "or what would you tell your other self", "or if you were doing something else", "for me, that\u2019s the skill which i think i\u2019m going to use the rest of my life and continue to grow and develop the rest of my life", "it\u2019s not any language i know today or any field, knowledge expertise or domain expertise", "it\u2019s just that working with other human beings and becoming better at it", "which is the thing i probably, especially as ceo, i think about and try to work on every day, is kind of the fun part, right", "because you think about it, most all fun activities involve at least one other person", "so if you can interact better with other humans, life gets better", "the final question as we end up, about one hour into this, from cesare roki, \u201cwhat is your evening routine (if you have one)?\u201d this is a cool one and i like cesare, that you put in the \u201cif you have one,\u201d because this is where i\u2019ll just be open and honest and vulnerable", "i\u2019d like to say that i have a cool evening routine", "the reality is that for whatever reason, the way that i currently work right now and live is that i kind of go until the gas tank is empty", "whether that\u2019s working, whether that\u2019s with friends or whatever", "then i, within a short period of time, run out of gas and i just fall asleep", "i\u2019ve been very fortunate that i\u2019ve never had trouble sleeping", "my head hits the pillows and people [inaudible]", "they laugh at this", "they\u2019re like, \u201cliterally, your head hit the pillow, 20 seconds later you were asleep,\u201d maybe snoring, i don\u2019t know", "it\u2019s like, \u201cwhat just happened", "you were talking just seconds ago.\u201d this literally happened last night", "i had four or five friends over", "the conversation was going great", "i didn\u2019t want to stop them", "so i said, \u201chey, keep going.\u201d but yesterday i had to wake up at like 4:00 a.m", "to catch another flight and get some work in and some meetings and things", "so i was just done, even though it was just 10:00 or 11:00", "so i said, \u201chey, keep going", "i\u2019ve got to peace out.\u201d if it had been a big party, i would have done the irish goodbye, where you just kind of leave without talking to anyone", "there was just four of us, so i said, \u201chey, keep going.\u201d i fell asleep as they were still having a great time", "i kind of hit the end of the road", "so that\u2019s my evening routine, is passing out", "i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s super useful, but i have thought a lot about morning routine", "this is the latest iteration, which i think i\u2019ve talked about before, but this is the latest", "i still use coach.me, which is the app where you can check things off every day", "it\u2019s like a daily to-do list", "the things i try to do every single morning are: i try to do reading in the morning, at least 30 minutes of reading because i find that\u2019s the time of the day where i am the most engaged", "after that is i take my vitamins and pills", "so that\u2019s elysium, which is \u2013 well, you can just google it", "i take some of the nootrobox ones, so like rise and kado", "and then just some other stuff, whatever tim has me taking at that time", "so like some ubiquinol, ginseng, whatever it is", "honestly, i didn\u2019t use to care about this stuff as much", "now that i\u2019m in my 30s, i figure it can\u2019t hurt, it might help and i\u2019ll do whatever tim\u2019s saying most recently", "i try to do a little bit of exercise, so right now it\u2019s plank", "i do a plank first, then i do squats, then i do push-ups, then i do some sun salutations to kind of stretch things out", "again, i\u2019m not super into yoga, but i do a few sun salutations every single day", "it\u2019s amazing", "finally, i meditate for at least ten minutes", "i use an app for that called calm \u2013 c-a-l-m", "then i look at my computer", "i try to do a blog post at least four or five days out of the week", "so essentially you could translate this into writing", "that, i would say, is my perfect morning", "now how many mornings do i hit all \u2013 there\u2019s three, six, eight of those things", "not all of them", "fewer than i would care to admit", "but to me, that has been the current recipe for a thing that just works the best", "so on that note, i will leave all of the amazing tim podcast listeners", "we all are a super cool group", "i am excited and honored and thank you to tim for allowing me to connect with y\u2019all again", "i can\u2019t wait to see the comments and tweets and everything that come out of this", "so i\u2019m happy to engage with y\u2019all", "again, i\u2019m matt mullenweg", "my twitter is @photomatt, p-h-o-t-o-m-a-t-t", "you can see my blogging at matt.blog or at ma.tt", "and i\u2019m on facebook as well"]}
