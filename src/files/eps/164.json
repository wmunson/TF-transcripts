Hello, boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is usually my job to deconstruct world-class performers across all different areas and industries \u2013 whether they be military, chess, sports, entertainment, or otherwise; business, of course, the obvious one. This time it is a conversation between friends and I am extremely excited to have Kevin Kelly back on the show. Kevin Kelly \u2013 I\u2019ve said this before \u2013 might be the real life most interesting man in the world. I\u2019m not making up what I\u2019m about to read to you. He is senior maverick at Wired magazine, which he co-founded in 1993. He also co-founded the All Species Foundation, a non-profit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on Earth. In his spare time \u2013 of course I\u2019m using that tongue and cheek \u2013 he writes bestselling books, many of them. He co-founded the Rosetta Project, which is building an archive of all documented human languages, and serves on the Board of the Long Now Foundation. As part of the last, he\u2019s investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species including the Wooly Mammoth. That is not made up, folks. We touch on a lot of really fun stuff in the episode. When Kevin arrived at my house to record, I had certain plans and I asked him what he wanted to highlight or focus on and we just decided to catch up, as friends. So this is very truly the type of conversation that led me, in the first place, many moons ago to ask, why don\u2019t I record these and share these conversations? Because I have so much fun catching up with friends like Kevin. This is about as close to a banter over drinks as you\u2019re going to get, in my life certainly, putting this out publicly. So I hope you enjoy it. We touch on all sorts of things: stories about Jeff Bezos and his email management approach, favorite books, impactful books, tech literacy, why there are \u201cno VR experts,\u201d which is very inspiring. There is a video that didn\u2019t make it into this interview but Kevin mentioned afterward that I think is \u201cThe History of Japan in Nine Minutes\u201d that I highly recommend everybody check out. We talk about the evolution of China, why he spends so much time in China, artificial intelligence, network effects, virtual reality, GMO, we talk about everything. If you think I am the only big fan of Kevin, well of course that\u2019s not true. Here is a little bit of praise for his most recent book called The Inevitable and these are real quotes. I\u2019ll truncate some of them. So here we go: \u201cAnyone can claim to be a prophet, a fortune teller or a futurist, and plenty of people do. What makes Kevin Kelly different is that he\u2019s right.\u201d It goes on and on. That\u2019s David Pogue; many of you will know. Then we have \u201cKevin Kelly has been predicting our technological future with uncanny prescience for years. Now he gives us a glimpse of how the next three decades will unfold.\u201d That\u2019s Ernest Cline, author of Ready Player One. And then also referring to the book (The Inevitable, that is) Marc Andreessen (who I had on the podcast recently), co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz and technological icon, refers to it as \u201can automatic must read.\u201d So I hope you enjoy this very informal and wide-ranging conversation with none other than Kevin Kelly. If you want to listen to a longer conversation where I dig into his bio and learn all sorts of nuggets that even I didn\u2019t know, then you can check out fourhourworkweek.com/Kevin. Just go to fourhourworkweek.com/ Kevin and you can find previous conversations with him. Enjoy. Kevin, welcome back to the show. Kevin Kelly: It\u2019s always a pleasure, Tim. It\u2019s so great to be here. Fantastic low horizontal space. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. It\u2019s great to have you in my house for a change. I remember still the very first Quantified Self meet-up at your place in Pacifica with however many people it was. Kevin Kelly: There were twenty-five people that showed up with a call to \u201cif you think you\u2019re quantifying yourself, come.\u201d Tim was one of the people who arrived. Tim Ferriss: It was a broad spectrum of folks. Kevin Kelly: It was; it was really good. We had no idea what to expect. This is Gary Wolf and I, probably eight or nine years ago. That was the very first meeting of the Quantified Self Movement. It was a meeting in my studio in Pacifica. Tim Ferriss: Where is Quantified Self now? What is the scope of that? Kevin Kelly: There\u2019s meetings in almost 300 cities around the world. Tim Ferriss: Amazing. Kevin Kelly: We have an international conference once a year. So it\u2019s entered into vocabulary \u2013 that is, people talk about it \u2013 whether for or against it. There are of course tons and tons of hardware sensors. The last CES before this year was called The Quantified Self CES because there were so many wearables. The Apple watch being one of many. So it sort of entered into the mainstream in a certain sense. It remains to be seen where it goes next. You\u2019re probably not wearing your Fitbit today. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not. Kevin Kelly: Some people have spells with this where they find it useful and the question is, how deep can these sensors go so they are something that everybody does? It\u2019s the new normal. I think we\u2019re still a ways from that. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far away from it being opt-out though instead of opt-in. Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: For most people \u2013 actually, you\u2019re already quantifying yourself, because you have an iPhone with an accelerometer that has location tracking and so on. Kevin Kelly: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: The fascination I have with your life extends in many different directions. But one is there\u2019s the Kevin Kelly futurist, technologist; and then there\u2019s the Kevin Kelly, and they\u2019re one in the same of course, but another aspect of you which sends me your family letters. I love getting these letters. They read like fiction, quite frankly. It\u2019s straight out of Rin Tin Tin. I remember just recently getting a text from you and it was from a number I didn\u2019t recognize. What did it say? \u201cI just finished tracking elephants\u201d? Kevin Kelly: Temple procession elephants in Kerala. And I\u2019m on my way to Oman tomorrow or whatever. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, \u201cWould you like to come?\u201d I was like \u201cI\u2019m sorry, who this is?\u201d You\u2019ve spent time with the Amish. We\u2019ve talked about this in episodes; in the first episode we did together, certainly. But at the same time, we can get really granular and tactical; but first, before we go to \u2013 I have a question about email and books and Hamilton and so on. Why do you spend so much time in China? You\u2019ve written a little about this in your family letter updates, but you seem to spend every year more and more time in China. And why do they love you so much? Kevin Kelly: Yes, okay. So it\u2019s a very complicated reason. My connection to China is kind of deep. Starting with the fact that my wife is Chinese and my kids are all bilingual and have spent time in China. But more importantly, I wrote a book called Out of Control twenty-five years ago or maybe more now, 1994, I guess. It was a little early because it was about how the internet was going to happen before the internet really happened. It was about how these decentralized, sharing things were going to \u2013 they were almost biologically inspired, and they were going to go into our built environment. That\u2019s what I was talking about. I was talking about all the rules that the internet were going to run by before there was internet. It never really took off in the US, but it was translated into Chinese, crowd source translated about five years ago. It was just at the right time when Honi Ma, Jack Ma, and all these guys in China were starting their internet companies. They read the book in Chinese and were influenced by it and talked about it. There\u2019s kind of a little bit of a social herd mentality in China. So when these famous successes were talking about this book \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t think we do that at all in the U.S. Kevin Kelly: Exactly, right. Everybody started to buy it. So I became, for better or worse, kind of the Alvin Toffler of China. They have this ridiculous idea that I\u2019m predicting the future. Because, in fact, there were very little predictions in the book. It was just that I was talking about things that later on became common. So they have this idea \u2013 they always introduce me as the guy who invented the internet or who predicted the internet. Of course, the next person who introduces me has to ratchet that up even higher, so it\u2019s embarrassing at this point. I have a lot of fans in China who are trying really hard to be innovative. They\u2019re listening to people from the West \u2013 not just me \u2013 about how to do that in their culture. So my book has become one of those books that they are reading to understand where it\u2019s going because they are rushing into that future so fast that they really need all the guidance they can get. Tim Ferriss: For people who don\u2019t know Toffler, can you give a little context? Kevin Kelly: Yeah. So Alvin Toffler wrote a book called Future Shock in the \u201870s or \u201880s. I don\u2019t remember where it was. But he, in some ways, for a long time was the most famous futurist; and even people who didn\u2019t know what he was talking about knew him as a futurist. So if you knew about a futurist, it was Alvin Toffler, even though you hadn\u2019t read his book. I have the same thing in China where people might recognize my name and call me a futurist, even though they have never read anything by him. So Alvin Toffler\u2019s book Future Shock is still worth reading. He was the one who introduced the term \u2018future shock\u2019 which was that people would actually have like a resistance or a reaction to the future, in general, just because things were changing fast. But he also invented, in that same book or the next one, the idea or the term \u201cprosumer.\u201d Which is a person who is both producing and consuming, which we now call user-generated content. But this idea that most of this economy would be prosumers. That was his idea in like the \u201870s or \u201880s, so he was way ahead. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s incredible. Kevin Kelly: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How do you see China changing in the next 10 to 20 years? Kevin Kelly: I believe that China is within five years on the cusp of actually having a global brand of something that everybody in the world would want. Tim Ferriss: Meaning a Nike, a fill in the blank. Kevin Kelly: Yeah exactly, whether it\u2019s a car or a drone, or a camera, or some appliance, or device, or digital thing that would be world-class in its innovation, in its quality. Like Sony became eventually for the Japanese. The reason why I think that is because, as you said, I go there a lot. I\u2019m going there probably every three months. I\u2019m not just going to the big cities, which I do my talks at, but I will always take an extra week or two and go out to the hinterlands. Out to Yunnan or Guangxi or some other province. I spent some time on the Silk Road way in the west, where it\u2019s Muslim, to get a sense of the other China and to gauge the depth of their dream. What do the Chinese want? They are going so fast, where are they aiming for? What they are trying to do is innovate. They are coming to the West to learn how to innovate. I think like we taught the Japanese how to do quality. The Japanese said, how do we do quality? So they went to Taylor and all these guys gave them a list of \u201cdo this and do this, and do this, and you\u2019ll have quality.\u201d The Japanese went through their list, they did it, and then they became the world\u2019s expert on making quality. The Chinese are saying, how do we do innovation? All the people from the West, \u201cYou need to have science fairs and you have to have innovation hubs. You have to have start-ups. You have to have all this stuff. So they\u2019re going down the checklist: we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019re going to do that. I think they are doing it and they are going to succeed in making something that we all want. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I feel that they\u2019re really doing all the things that they wanted to do, although there are two cultural characters that they haven\u2019t yet gotten to. And those two cultural ones are that they haven\u2019t yet embraced failure and they still don\u2019t collectively question authority enough. They\u2019re working on those and they know that they have to do those and they know that those are difficult to do collectively. Individually of there\u2019s no problem. The Chinese come to America, they can do all of this; but collectively as a culture, those are challenging for them. They\u2019re working on them. It\u2019ll be some more years but I think they will do it. Tim Ferriss: Now if you look at, let\u2019s say Singapore, I know we are getting pretty China-focused here, but as a sidebar you were talking about visiting these sort of far flung corners of China. China \u2013 just for those people who are listening who haven\u2019t been \u2013 is a lot more diverse than you might think. In fact, when you hear Chinese, the language for instance, like Mandarin Chinese \u2013 it\u2019s basically Beijing dialect Chinese. On top of that, if you were to go to China, there are many ways to say Chinese depending on where you are. It indicates a lot of how you feel. So you could say like [Speaking Chinese] like center, the center county, middle kingdom language. Then you can also say like [Speaking Chinese] so the language of the Han people who are the dominant ethnic group. Kevin Kelly: [Speaking Chinese]. Tim Ferriss: [Speaking Chinese] if you go to Taiwan. Now the mainlanders hate that. If you say [Speaking Chinese] that means kind of like the mainland talk. I mean I\u2019m translating very liberally here. That, of course, really irks the Chinese who view Taiwan as a rogue province that is nonetheless still a part of them, much like Quebec or something in Canada. The other point that I was going to make, or question, rather, that I was going to impose is, if you look at Singapore. Singapore has tried with some success for at least I would say the last ten years to replicate Silicon Valley. They\u2019ve faced very similar cultural hurdles, but they have fantastic, at least my impression is, financial resources. They have unilateral freedom to do whatever they want. They have a well-educated population. They are very, very, very small, right? The sandbox is incredibly small. You can walk around Singapore in a day and then you\u2019re like what am I going to do here? I need to go to Malaysia to have a new meal. Why will China differ? Is it just the sheer number of people that they have to choose from or to filter from, from which you can find the Michael Jordans, the Jeff Bezos, the fill-in-the-blank? Kevin Kelly: Absolutely, I think this is an arithmetic problem. I mean, 1.4 billion people. By the way there\u2019s like .3 billion North Americans. There\u2019s a billion more of them. I think there definitely is a critical mass, a scale that the Chinese have. It\u2019s almost translated into a momentum that you need and that you have this critical mass of people behind you doing. You were mentioning the diversity, which Singapore does not have as much of, but it does have a lot for being a little city, but not compared to China. You have a huge diversity in China, as you were saying. Not just the language, but even ethnically, geographically. So I think they have all those necessary requirements, the requisite complexity that you would need to make something. But I would say two things: One is, if they attempt to make another Silicon Valley, I think that fails. There are network effects in all these things and the network effect says that the best get bigger. And the bigger you get, the better you get. And the better you get, the bigger you get. So you have this sort of compounding acceleration. That means that there is only going to be one or two dominant players. By the way, AI is going to be a network effects phenomenon. Social media is a network effect phenomenon. The kind of start-up culture is a network effect phenomenon in a particular category.\nSo if they try to do a Silicon Valley for software, it will not happen. If they decide to take something, which I think they might, like robotics or aviation, or biotech, and really develop and grow to a sufficient scale, I think they could have an equivalent. Right now they do have one in manufacturing. Tim Ferriss: Right. Kevin Kelly: The Pearl River Delta area from Guangzhou to Shenzhen. Hong Kong that is, that is basically one they do the world\u2019s best manufacturing in China. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s the cheapest, it\u2019s because it\u2019s the best and they have this whole ecosystem, with thousands and thousands of suppliers and dynamic real time inventory control and this whole thing. They do have the Silicon Valley for manufacturing in that area, and they will continue to grow that and people are going there not because they\u2019re the cheapest, in some cases they aren\u2019t, but because they have the absolute best in manufacturing. Tim Ferriss: How much of the \u2013 and this is for those people listening. Kevin and I decided to wing it. We had a conversation prior to recording and this is just us talking about stuff that we\u2019re interested in. I\u2019ve been, over the last few weeks, discussing with folks visiting Silicon Valley and the origins of Silicon Valley, or trying my best to explain why Silicon Valley may have happened here and not elsewhere. How much of Silicon Valley do you think can be attributed to a handful of companies that just happened to land here, like Fairchild or some of these semiconductor companies? The inability to enforce non-compete contracts in California, which I think allowed these people to then split off and form many other companies that might have stepped on their former bosses\u2019 territory or other? When somebody asks you why did Silicon Valley happen here, what do you say? Kevin Kelly: So there are reasons why. There was actually a really good book on this by AnnaLee Saxenian, I believe her name was. She studied Route 128 around Boston and Silicon Valley and compared the two. Because Route 128 actually had a little head start in this kind of tech world. Why didn\u2019t they become the Silicon Valley? Tim Ferriss: Why didn\u2019t Sand Hill Road kill them? Kevin Kelly: Yeah, and part of the reason; there\u2019s a number of different reasons, but one of them was because, I think you mentioned a couple but there\u2019s others. And that was Silicon Valley was so far from the West Coast government, the D.C. government that they \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Or the East Coast government. Kevin Kelly: Excuse me, the East Coast government, D.C. \u2013 that they had to find a whole bunch of different sources for funding. They invented the funding model. Which 128 around Boston was still locked into a lot of the government defense contracts. Tim Ferriss: Right. Kevin Kelly: Okay? So that was kind of the difficulty, but a liberation for Silicon Valley, where it was really divorced from the government hand-outs or government subsidies, the government funding. Not completely, but enough to actually really develop this other, alternative way of financing things. Tim Ferriss: Venture capital. Kevin Kelly: Right, venture capital. I think psychologically there was this other division, this other kind of divorcing from the whole California story of no adult supervision, not asking for permission, which started with the \u201849ers and before. I think that also continued to influence the culture. So there was a cultural innovation. Many people say that the greatest invention from Silicon Valley was not the transistor or software, it was this model. It was this innovation model. That is the kind of Meta \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The innovation model meaning the set of beliefs and maxims and so on that those people carried in their heads? Kevin Kelly: Exactly, right. The venture funding model, the startup model, this method, this culture that would reward. The joke was you change your job and you walk across the street. And also the fact that you were encouraged to change your job. Far from lifelong employment, but this idea that you\u2019ve been here a couple years, time to move on. So there was a whole bunch of things that are ingredients to that. This book studied this in a more economically rigorous way of why did one surpass the other? Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s a number of fascinating documentaries on this as well and maybe it\u2019s all sort of hindsight logical, but in reality, 90 percent of it was just random collision of people and factors; I don\u2019t know. Kevin Kelly: I would also recommend John Markoff\u2019s book with this really trippy title called What the Dormouse Said. Tim Ferriss: What the Dormouse Said. Kevin Kelly: Which is about the hippy origins of the personal computer industry. So there\u2019s a whole other strand which is very influential, which was the fact that the hippy generation embraced computers unlike the other technologies that they rejected. And they embraced them from Doug Engelbart to Steve Jobs, to a lot of the AI guys. A lot of the people in the early computer industry had a little of the hippy background and they saw these things as augmentations, as basically it\u2019s kind of like a new age way to augment the human. So when people left the communes \u2013 they tried the communes, they didn\u2019t work. With the long hair. But they learned a lot of skills, including small business skills. Making their candles, and their sandals, and their macram\u00e9, selling honey or whatever it was. So unlike people who went to college and never dropped out; who went to work for the big organizations, the IBM, they were at the craft fairs getting business skills. Then when they came along, they transferred those directly into this idea of small businesses which were not cool. If you told somebody in the \u201850s that you were at a startup that was a code for \u201cI\u2019m unemployed, I was fired.\u201d Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like consultant right? Oh, you mean unemployed. That was the analog. Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: Have you ever been to \u2013 I know I\u2019m jumping around here \u2013 but to Christiania? I think it\u2019s in Copenhagen. Kevin Kelly: Yes, in Copenhagen. Tim Ferriss: So there\u2019s this area \u2013 for people who haven\u2019t been \u2013 called Christiania. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m getting it roughly right. It\u2019s effectively like a hippy/anarchist commune in the middle of or around Copenhagen. There are gates that you walk through and it says here ends the European Union when you walk through. And as you describe, it is people walking their kids around in wheelbarrows, making honey, and making candles. They have breweries. It\u2019s such a funky experience. Kevin Kelly: It\u2019s a little autonomous region that started off as a squatter city that is now semi-legal in some capacity and they do have their own little government at this point and it\u2019s quite extensive. You could spend \u2013 it\u2019s not as quite as big as Singapore. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not that far off. Kevin Kelly: Right. It\u2019s a worthy experiment to go visit because there are lots of alternative governments and structures. Cultures are really important. Let me just say one thing about travel before we go into other things. I travel a lot, not just to China but to other places, as much as I can because I find that it really keeps my mind flexible. In fact, I find that it\u2019s the most exercise I can do in a short amount of time than anything else. I mean sure I can learn a new language and do all these other things. I find you can do all of those while you\u2019re traveling too. But travel really forces me to be flexible and to confront others and to think about things differently. Even whether if I have a different idea there, it\u2019s just the habit of trying to think and come at things differently that I find really, really useful; in addition to the fact that you actually literally are looking at your own culture from a different lens but even just the general habit of trying to let go of what you think you know. I go to China above all else because every time I go, I actually have decided I know less than the last time. There\u2019s so much happening there; it\u2019s happening so fast; it\u2019s so big, the Chinese have no idea what\u2019s happening. I think I know something and then I go and I realize I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here either. I know less than the last time I visited. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a different country than the last time you were there. Kevin Kelly: Right. I think travel is so important, particularly to young people that I really think it should be subsidized at the federal level. Tim Ferriss: I think gap year should be mandatory. Kevin Kelly: I think a two-year national service should be a requirement and you can fulfill it anyway you want including going overseas and working at the Peace Corps or a visa or whatever it is. Take two years. Want to go do military? Fine. Want to go to an inner city? Fine. You want to go overseas? Fine. We\u2019ll pay you for two years. Nothing would transform America as having an overseas experience for the majority of people who, by the way, don\u2019t have passports at this moment. Tim Ferriss: I agree. I could not agree more. We agreed on a few other things earlier when we were talking about podcast questions and I was making some funky mushroom coffee, not of the psychedelic sort, that I\u2019ll describe some other time. But you suggested that I ask people about their email systems. How do they handle inbound email? Kevin Kelly: Right, because for ordinary people, they get a lot of email. But if you have any level or success or notoriety or prominence, dealing with the incoming in a sane way that actually works is a real mystery to me. People like yourself, or even the other people who get a lot of demands on them, how do you actually deal with email? Do you have more than one account? If you have more than one account, how do you handle it? Do you have your assistant involved? Tim Ferriss: Etc., etc., there are many different facets to it. Kevin Kelly: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: And you mentioned you had a conversation with Jeff Bezos. I said we have to save that for the podcast. So now I have to ask, what was this conversation? Kevin Kelly: So I had the opportunity to ask Jeff at some point about his email. Because I wanted to send something. I said, \u201cWho do I send it to, how do you do your email?\u201d Again, I think this is probably a ten-year-old answer. So I can\u2019t verify this is happening. But he said, \u201cI finally figured out what to do. So here\u2019s is what it is, is anything you send to me,\u201d and actually, his email is fairly well-circulated. He says, \u201cAnything you send to me, my assistants will read and they are in charge of responding or doing something with it.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Right, vetting. Kevin Kelly: No, to give the appropriate response. \u201cBut I also read it all, and since I don\u2019t really normally answer it unless there is something. And then if there is something that I want to respond to, I\u2019ll respond to it. So the worst case scenario that you\u2019ll get two replies from me: from my assistant, if it needs to be replied to, and me.\u201d So in other words, everything goes in a parallel circuit; once to his assistants and they deal with what has to be (and most of it\u2019s probably going to be ignored). Those that need to be done something, they may nudge him or whatever. And he\u2019s also looking at it, and he can reply personally to it. He said the worst is you might get two. That seemed to be \u2013 he has one email and I have gotten responses to that email, and sometimes it just goes and obviously he doesn\u2019t respond to it. Tim Ferriss: Into the ether. Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: Do you still have \u2013 this is something that I\u2019ve had to get increasingly better at because the tools and tactics as I laid them out, for instance, in The 4-Hour Workweek still work very well; however, I\u2019ve had to develop more nuanced layers on top of what I did because now it\u2019s thousands of emails coming and hitting me, my assistants, everyone. Deciding how to vet and use tools like Boomerang to schedule things to be set in the future or automatic follow-ups, you name it, moving a lot of internal communication, the slack so it\u2019s separate from the inbox, etc. Do you still have an assistant and a separate researcher? Kevin Kelly: I do. I have an assistant and a full-time researcher, but they don\u2019t do my mail, so I do all my own mail. Tim Ferriss: What is your researcher currently helping you with, if you can talk about it? Kevin Kelly: I would love to talk about it. In fact, we just had a review today. So I\u2019ve been working on a project. Tim Ferriss: A review meaning that you reviewed \u2013 Kevin Kelly: We have an annual review. I have an annual review with the two people who work for me. So once a year we sit down and we do an employee review, we talk about the past year and evaluate what\u2019s coming up. Her name is Camille, and what Camille is working on is we are gathering every long-term forecast that we can find anywhere, in any of the industries or published anywhere. We\u2019re bringing them together and we\u2019re going to try to integrate all the long-term forecasts into one integrated forecast of the future; long-term meaning ten years or more. Tim Ferriss: So forecasts could be anything from \u201cthis is how we see gasoline prices moving in the next 20 years,\u201d to \u201cthis is how we anticipate air travel to the number of seats filled in air travel to move in the next 20 years.\u201d Kevin Kelly: Right. And we\u2019re going even broader, like the future of sports, the number of attendees at sports game, transportation. We are going through the whole list of things. So she\u2019s been working on it for six months and we probably have another six months of what I call the \u201cofficial future.\u201d Having being trained in GBN, which was a consultancy that did strategy for global companies, the mantra was that \u201call predictions are wrong,\u201d and generally, particularly official futures; so there\u2019s official extrapolation. You take what\u2019s been happening for the past five years and you extrapolate. They are invariably not correct, because things jig and jag and new things are invented that disrupt the pattern. But my premise is that while they\u2019re wrong, that they\u2019re still useful. And they would be particularly useful if they were integrated together. So you would say the future of transportation looks like this and the future of electric cars looks like this and they both can\u2019t be right, they have to inform each other in some ways. So that\u2019s the next step of integrating and having these official futures inform each other and to see if I can make a scenario that\u2019s more useful out of the sum of the parts. So she has been working on that for six months. She also did the research when I was doing the big cover story for Wired on VR. So for five months I was trying out every single VR headset, input, content that I could and I wrote this article. And the way Wired works, like other magazines, is they have this fact checking which is sort of in some way kind of a legal cover-your-ass thing. Tim Ferriss: Cover your ass thing. Kevin Kelly: Which means every single statement that I make has to be verified and proven. Like a scholarly article, like a footnote, which is totally insane but that\u2019s what you have to do. So we were involved in \u2013 you say something that seems obvious to you, there\u2019s some statement \u2013 \u201cVR, people get sick in it, or they have motion sickness.\u201d \u201cCan you prove that? Where does that come from? How do you know about that?\u201d So she did a lot of the hard legwork in finding the documentation for these kinds of statements that aren\u2019t footnoted in the article, but actually are footnoted in what I turn over to them. So I have a completely scholarly footnoted article. People don\u2019t realize that, like behind the scenes of New Yorker and Wired and places like that, there is a huge amount of \u2013 there is a full-time staff that will fact check every single fact. Tim Ferriss: Oh yeah. It\u2019s a big, dedicated staff. Kevin Kelly: By the way, books do not do that and newspapers do not do that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. We can spend a lot of time talking about all of that. Kevin Kelly: So going back to my assistants. I have a researcher who does all that kind of research and anything else I need research on, which that\u2019s the main thing, but this was my one dream was to have somebody \u2013 this was even before Google that I could ask \u2013 I do a lot of travel. So they sometimes do research on simple things, like is it a sane idea to rent a car in Oman or should I get a driver? So you troll the TripAdvisor boards. Tim Ferriss: The State Department, [inaudible]. Kevin Kelly: It\u2019s just kind of looking around, yeah it\u2019s that kind of stuff. Tim Ferriss: How do you decide aside from those types of logistics? How do you choose projects for your researcher to help you with? And you could delve into anything that you\u2019d like. So how do you choose? Kevin Kelly: Like projects in general? What am I going to do next? Tim Ferriss: Sure, yeah. How do you choose what you\u2019re going to do next? Kevin Kelly: Okay. So this has taken me a long time to get there, but one of the questions that I \u2013 well you have seen these Venn diagrams of things you like to do, things that other people need? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Kelly: But for me, there is actually a third important circle. And that\u2019s not just things that I want to do, so that has to be a key thing that I\u2019m good at doing, that\u2019s the second thing. Because there\u2019s lots of things I would have fun doing, but I\u2019m not good at. So they have to be things I\u2019m good at. And then there is maybe would be useful to other people. But this other circle that\u2019s become more important to me is, can anybody else do it? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, right. Kevin Kelly: If somebody else can do it, I am not going to do it. I spend a lot of time trying to give away ideas and trying to talk about what I\u2019m doing in the hope that someone else comes along and says, \u201cOh, I\u2019m doing that.\u201d That\u2019s like whew, what a relief because now I\u2019m not doing that. It\u2019s like I\u2019m talking about this future stuff \u2013 if I could find out someone else out there \u2013 they write to me and they say \u201cI\u2019m doing that.\u201d I\u2019m like oh, my gosh, thank you. Now I don\u2019t have to do that. And so what I\u2019m trying to look for is really good things that I would enjoy, that other people value, that nobody else is going to do. That I can\u2019t convince anyone else to do. They think it\u2019s a terrible idea or they think it\u2019s a lousy idea, but for some reason I think it\u2019s a good idea and I can\u2019t get anyone else to do it. I can\u2019t talk; no one will steal it from me. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re trying to give it away and no one will take it. Kevin Kelly: I\u2019m trying to give it away and no one\u2019s going to take it. It\u2019s like all right, I have to do that now. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s how I feel about books. So I get asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you write a book on this? Why don\u2019t you write a book on that?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThere are already plenty of good books on both of those subjects.\u201d Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: It has to be something that bothers me for so long, but seems like such a crackpot idea for everybody else, I can\u2019t buy it anywhere to scratch the itch. And I\u2019m like, okay, well \u2026 Kevin Kelly: That\u2019s me. Tim Ferriss: Just to fix that neurosis, I have to address it. So titles are important and you mentioned the title of a book just a few minutes ago before we started recording that caught my attention, because we were looking at the slow creep of books and piles on my table, which is ironically right next to this Marie Kondo book on the Japanese magic of tidying up. Kevin Kelly: Let\u2019s be more accurate. The book about cleaning up is on a stack of other stuff. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. Which I took a photograph of because it\u2019s a lot better than it was. It used to be like the trash compactor in Star Wars, and this book on Japanese decluttering would just surf this wave of flotsam and jetsam around my house. It\u2019s a lot better now. But you mentioned that another book called All Too Much \u2013 Kevin Kelly: It\u2019s All Too Much, and it actually preceded her book at least in English. I thought it was so valuable, that in this really huge book I did called Cool Tools, I list it as the very first tool, which was how to deal with all this stuff, how not to have a bunch of stuff. I actually gave it a whole page because I thought the message was so profound. Because it\u2019s not about tidying up and cleaning, he talks about the fact that if you have something that is valuable, you need to show it. Hiding things, if you have collections and they are not visible, then they are not working for you. He\u2019s not against collecting things, but if you collect them they have to be prominent. They have to bring you joy, they have to be doing something in your life. What you want with decluttering is to remove the junk so you have room for your treasure. All these things where it\u2019s not about the stuff. It\u2019s about your mental state, your openness to new ideas. And the clutter is, in some ways, prohibiting your self-fulfillment, the best you. Because it\u2019s hiding, you\u2019re buried under it. There is this sort of \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it pop psychology \u2013 but it is a little bit about trying to get at the core of what you are about, what your house is about, what your life is about, and making room for these things, and the kind of that techniques he uses are very similar to what the Japanese gal, I can\u2019t remember her name \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Kondo. Kevin Kelly: Kondo. Which is you pick up something and does that object give you joy? Actually, what she does is different. She says take everything in your house, and she goes by categories. Put all your clothes in the center, make a big pile, and by default, you\u2019re going to get rid of all of them. But as you\u2019re going through, if you pick up something that gives you joy, that\u2019s what you keep. Everything else is just gone. The same thing about all your other possessions. Category by category you decide they\u2019re all by default going to be gone, and you only retrieve those things that give you joy. That\u2019s a little bit what he\u2019s talking about in that same kind of profound way. Tim Ferriss: I did try this; I gave it a good college try, and I did find certain aspects of it very helpful, but then the joy part \u2013 I picked up these printouts that were legal documents or tax returns and I\u2019m like, not joyful. This is not giving me joy. But it would be very neglectful and irresponsible of me to throw these out. Now what, Marie Kondo? The topic of simplicity is one that I try to consistently return to because our lives tend to interrupt you, right? Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: What books or resources have you found helpful for simplifying your life? And if that\u2019s not the right question, you can tackle it a different way. Kevin Kelly: Well I think it\u2019s all too much of this decluttering and her books are actually helpful in simplifying things. I am maybe not as big a fan of simplicity as you are. I think our lives are inherently more complex than our parents and our grandparents and our children and their grandchildren and future generations will be more complicated. I think that is generally the drift of this thing we call life and evolution and technology, and they\u2019re going to become more and more complicated. I think right now some people are very upset over our kind of distracted manner or the way we skip through or surf through the nets and internet and social media. I actually think that a very sane response to the environment. Where we have to scan because things are much more complicated and we\u2019ll do more scanning in the future. I think maybe there\u2019s appropriate kinds of complexity; complications maybe we avoid and complexity is okay. The thing about life is that it surfs a very fine line between rigid order, which is death, and complete chaos. There is this edge of chaos, they call it. There is this edge where there\u2019s this particular kind of falling forward or particular kind of chaotic order, or orderly chaos, or something. I think it\u2019s not rigid simplicity and it\u2019s not just overly chaotic complications. There is a very fine variety of complexity that is not just healthy, but it is the source and the genius of health, wealth, and everything else that we want. Tim Ferriss: So I think I might be able to ask a better question, which is, in face of the notifications and social media pings and so on and so forth, a lot of people feel anxious and they feel conflicted and over committed. Maybe you just mask it really well, but I\u2019ve never had that feeling from you. I\u2019ve never gotten the impression that you feel those things. Why not? Are there particular rules or ways that you \u2013 Kevin Kelly: There is one thing and that is \u2013 and maybe this is kind of a Zen thing. The Zen mantra is \u201cSit, sit, walk, walk, don\u2019t wobble.\u201d Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t heard that before. Kevin Kelly: Yeah. So it\u2019s this idea that when I\u2019m with a person, that\u2019s total priority. Anything else is multi-tasking; no, no, no, no. So I have a priority. The people to people, person to person trumps anything else. If there is anything else going on, whatever. I have given my dedication to this. If I go to a play or a movie, I am at the movie. I am not anywhere else. It\u2019s like 100 percent I am going to listen. If I go to a conference, I am going to go to the conference. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. I have never seen you on a device while with or near other people. Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: Now that I think about it. Kevin Kelly: Even at Wired. I had the rules of if I\u2019m with a person to person and the phone rings \u2013 no, never. If I\u2019m on the phone and a notification rings \u2013 no, I\u2019m on the phone. So I think this sense of, and you can have a priority if you want, whatever it is. But it\u2019s sort of like I\u2019m going to give, I\u2019m going to be present, whatever that is, at that time and everything else we\u2019ll deal with it later. Tim Ferriss: \u201cSit, sit, walk, walk, don\u2019t wobble.\u201d Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: What books have you found have given you \u2013 and I always come back to books (it doesn\u2019t have to be books \u2013 sources, something that people listening could look at themselves or listen to), have given you rules like that or maxims or sayings that have proved very useful? Kevin Kelly: Well, I come from religious tradition and I actually think some of the religious texts are very good for that. I think it\u2019s very hard to read the Bible all the way through. By the way, I recommend that you do that at least once in your life. No matter who you are, sit down \u2013 well, it will take a long time. But read through the Bible and read a modern version. It will take you some time. It is probably the most amazing thing you haven\u2019t read yet. It\u2019s highly disturbing, highly influential and whatever your opinion about it is, you\u2019re going to be wrong. Whatever you think, whether you think it\u2019s the greatest \u2013 read it through it\u2019s an amazing book. I say the same thing about the Koran. Try to read the Sufi stuff. There is nothing that I enjoy more than at night reading Rumi. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Kelly: I mean it\u2019s just something about it. He\u2019s a Sufi mystic from Afghanistan who is a transcendent, thought leader maybe like Seneca or something. He has tremendous wisdom. So I think the wisdom of the ancients, in general, have a lot to offer us and I think reading the Zen parables, you know, the sound of one hand clapping, Zen mind, beginner mind \u2013 these kinds of things. For me, that kind of wisdom \u2013 it\u2019s not like you have to slavish or obedient to them. Take what you find useful, move on. But I found a lot of use in those texts. Tim Ferriss: So we have in a sense these timeless philosophies and belief structures that can help us make better decisions and so on. Then we have subject matter expertise of different types that can become more or less relevant over time. We were chatting before we started recording about a question that I get asked all the time. Which is, what industry should I be paying attention to in the next three to five years? What skills should I learn? And most of these are business focused \u2013 but what skills should I learn to be able to take advantage of new, non-obvious industries in the next 10 to 15 years? Kevin Kelly: Right. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned, and I might be getting the wording here off, but sort of tech literacy? Kevin Kelly: Techno literacy. Tim Ferriss: Techno literacy, different types of literacy, can you elaborate on that. Kevin Kelly: Right. So let me put it, again, into a little bit of context. I\u2019ll talk a bit more, but let me just preface and say that I do talk a bit about this in my new book called The Inevitable. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I have one of the few copies right here in front of me. Kevin Kelly: Tim has one of the first copies off the press. It\u2019s talking about the next 20 to 30 years, mostly about digital technology and the trends that I consider non-negotiable, inevitable in the sense that there is not much we can do about it. There\u2019s a lot we can do about the specifics, but I don\u2019t know about the bigger trends. They are coming whether we want them to or not. Tim Ferriss: The Inevitable subtitle, \u201cUnderstanding the 12 Technological Forces that will Shape our Future.\u201d Kevin Kelly: Right. And one of the first chapter talks about this question of skills. I think that the specifics, like what language should I be learning in school? Or what business skills should I have? I think what I think are more useful and what I counsel even my own kids about, are there are these mental level skills. The skills of learning how to learn, the skills of learning how technology, in general, operates, which is what I would call the techno literacy skills. An example of a techno literacy skill is that besides the initial purchase cost of the technology, whatever you buy you, you now have a maintenance cost. That maintenance cost is making sure that it\u2019s upgraded or integrated, or just maintaining it in some capacity. So there are several levels of the cost. It\u2019s not just how much does it costs to buy, how much does it cost to maintain in your life. There\u2019s a price to dealing with it when it breaks down, upgrading. It\u2019s sort of like owning a boat, a little bit. It\u2019s not the initial cost of the boat, it\u2019s the maintenance that really is the costly part. And the same thing with anything that we buy. So if you get something into your house, there is now a relationship with that thing. It\u2019s like having a pet or an animal or something. You have to deal with it and its interaction with other things. That\u2019s just an elementary thing. There is also a negative cost too, in terms of whatever it is that we have, there is going to be some downside. Journalists are usually pretty good about identifying. You should pay attention to what people say about the negative aspects of it because they are real. It\u2019s not that they should discourage you from using the technology, and I\u2019ll argue that it shouldn\u2019t, but we should be aware of them and willing in a certain sense to pay the price. Tim Ferriss: What would be an example, a clear example to you of a technology with a downside that perhaps is underappreciated or downsides that are underappreciated? Kevin Kelly: Automobiles kill one million humans on earth every year. Now imagine if we were going to introduce automobiles and say here are cars. It\u2019ll kill one million of us, do you want to drive it? Tim Ferriss: Not the best pitch I\u2019ve heard. Kevin Kelly: I know, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m saying there are all these hidden \u2013 but that\u2019s real and this is one of the reasons why I think driverless cars are going to \u2013 even though they will \u2013 here\u2019s the thing. The first driverless car that kills a person, people will go completely bananas, but we are killing one million of them ourselves. That\u2019s not registered for some reason. It\u2019s like, that doesn\u2019t count? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they\u2019ve lost the reference point. Kevin Kelly: Exactly. So there is going to be driverless cars will kill some people, but they are not going to kill as many as we kill. So in evaluating that, in evaluating whether you want to get in \u2013 there are going to be, by the way, ethical issues with driverless cars because we give ourselves a pass when we have an accident. It\u2019s like, I didn\u2019t have time to react or I wasn\u2019t thinking. But the driverless car has to be programmed. And so you have to give it a preference. If there is an accident, do you give the passenger safety preference over the pedestrian? Tim Ferriss: Right. Or do you give the three elementary school kids \u2013 Kevin Kelly: The trolley problem. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. The trolley problem. Over the seven people who are 70 years old. Kevin Kelly: Right. So when you go to buy a car and Volvo says, \u201cWe give passengers preference,\u201d is that ethical? Tim Ferriss: Is the programming one of the selling points? You are 12 percent less likely to be sacrificed in compromising environments. Kevin Kelly: Exactly. So techno literacy is to like say we need to cognizant of this, if there\u2019s cost, if there\u2019s ethical dimensions to this. And there are other techno literacy skills, like the fact that you don\u2019t really want to learn a language, a programming language, you want to learn how to learn a language, because you are going to have to relearn it later on and you want to understand that when you buy something, it is immediately obsolete, right? It\u2019s always, by definition. So one of the things I recommend is you want to buy things five minutes before you need it not ever before. There is no sense in hoarding this stuff because it\u2019s just going to change just in time. Tim Ferriss: Just in time. Just in case. Kevin Kelly: Exactly. So there are things, I think those kinds of skills are going to much more useful. I think I might have said this before, but when I was at Wired and we were doing hiring, first of all I never looked at anybody\u2019s educational background. I looked at their experience. The model that I had in my head was you hire for attitude and the skills we\u2019ll train. We\u2019ll train for skills. I wasn\u2019t really hiring people for skill set per se, it was more of their attitude, their orientation, their techno literacy, their ability to learn and adapt. That was far more valuable than the particular skills they had. Now at some level, skills play into it and sure, there is a certain skill requirement, but I think maybe as important is these other levels. Tim Ferriss: Now it makes me think of this, I think it\u2019s a bit from Neil Gaiman\u2019s commencement speech \u201cMake Good Art,\u201d but he says at some point he realized that there are three important components if you want to keep a job. It is get along with people, have people like you, deliver things on time, be good at your job. He said, the good thing is you don\u2019t really need all three, you just need two out of the three. If you have two out of the three, they\u2019ll keep you around. Do things on time, have people like you, or be really, really good. He\u2019s like, you only need two of the three. Kevin Kelly: Do things on time is really great, but in terms of other people who are self-starters, like if you don\u2019t have a job if you\u2019re trying to do something, the equivalent of that is to just do lots of it over and over and over again. I can\u2019t emphasize how important that doing it a lot is, because the only way to get through, the only way to find out what you\u2019re really good at or if no one else can do, is basically a lifelong project. Tim Ferriss: You have to throw a lot against the wall and see what sticks. Kevin Kelly: You have to do a lot and lot. The more failures you have, the more successes. It\u2019s a really, very clear ratio that\u2019s linked. You just have to do a lot. That\u2019s the only way you can find out what you\u2019re good at. Because how many college kids, young people coming out, they say \u201cI don\u2019t have a passion. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m good at.\u201d The only way that I know to find out your passion is to actually work to it by trying lots of stuff and becoming expert at something. Tim Ferriss: Right. Well, in a way this might sound clich\u00e9d, but instead of discovering yourself, you\u2019re creating yourself. These kids (kids \u2013 I sound like such an old man) but these young people who graduate from college and then they want to sit down and journal for ten minutes or take multiple choice tests to figure out their Myers Briggs and have their kind of assignment for passion. I\u2019m like, that\u2019s not how this works. You\u2019re not a block of ice that is being chipped away to reveal the sculpture underneath. You\u2019re actually just a small piece of clay and all the other bits and pieces need to be added. There is a kernel of it that is you, but you need to construct that and the way you do that is by doing these experiments and trying X, Y, and Z and everything else in between. I still feel like I\u2019m doing that. Kevin Kelly: I\u2019m still doing that. I\u2019m almost 65; I\u2019m still doing that. And the people that I respect the most in my circle are still doing that. They are still asking themselves at 70 years old, what I am going to do when I grow up? I mean, it\u2019s like who am I? What am I here for? Should I be doing this? And that\u2019s actually why I respect them so much because they are still constructing their life rather than discovering it or finding it. They are constructing it and I think that\u2019s a really wonderful metaphor. Tim Ferriss: You said a while back when we were just putzing around in my living room looking at the living wall and what not; you said there are no VR experts. Kevin Kelly: Right. So I wrote this big cover story in Wired about VR, and a couple years ago I wrote about AI and, by the way, these are the kinds of things that are in my book, The Inevitable, where I\u2019m looking at these things which are coming. AI is coming in a big way, VR is coming. The particulars of how it arrives, who owns it, how it\u2019s structured \u2013 those are not inevitable, those are not predictable. They make a lot of difference to us. So we have a lot of choice in this thing. But one of the things I want to emphasize is that right now, basically, there are no VR experts. It\u2019s completely open. Really, we (collectively) humans have no idea how VR is going to work, what content will really work best in VR, what the necessary amount of equipment will be, what that consumer breakthrough version will be. Even though there is VR today, the VR today is good enough improve. So it hasn\u2019t been good enough to improve but now today with the Oculus and the Vive and this other stuff, it\u2019s now good enough to improve for reasons I can talk about. It will improve very fast, but there are no experts. So that means that a person out there listening to this, could easily become a VR expert, okay? There are really no AI experts. There are a lot of people working on AI, but compared to what we\u2019ll know in 20 years from now, we don\u2019t know anything. So it\u2019s actually not that difficult to become an AI expert. Tim Ferriss: So let\u2019s say someone listening said, you know what? I\u2019ve read about VR; this is really exciting. I\u2019m tired of my comparative literature major. I\u2019d like to switch gears and really immerse myself. What would you suggest they do? If they seemed earnest, intelligent, they were committed, they were like I want to become a VR expert or AI, you can take your pick. Kevin Kelly: Yeah. There was a guy, Kent Bye, who runs the Voices of VR podcast. Two years ago, he quit his job and has interviewed 400, he\u2019s done 400 interviews of almost every person working in VR. That\u2019s his job now is he just does interviews of the voices of people working in VR. He\u2019s doing the journalistic side. I would say it\u2019s very easy, which is you purchase some gear and you start making VR; you actually do it. You buy or you get a pair of Google VR, Cardboard, which you can get for free. Use your phone and start making VR. You\u2019ll learn more about it than reading about it, than working, whatever it is. Try to make a VR experience. Make something for five minutes. The issues are incredible. There\u2019s lighting issues, there\u2019s continuity issues. We don\u2019t even have a vocabulary for editing. Like in cinema we have syntax of what a cut is. Tim Ferriss: Right. Kevin Kelly: How do you do a jump, a dissolve. Tim Ferriss: A panning shot of X, Y, and Z. Kevin Kelly: We don\u2019t have any of that. None of it really works in VR. It doesn\u2019t mean the same thing. So someone has to invent all of those. The interface, the mouse; there is no mouse for VR. There are people who have invented it, but there is nothing that has worked like Windows and the mouse that Engelbart made. So there is so much that has to be invented and that somebody who just decides that they\u2019re going to work at this every day or every day on weekends or whatever it is, can make a huge advance. I think you\u2019ll need to do it because you love it. Because this is not economics; we\u2019re talking about investing into mastery. Tim Ferriss: I was having a chat with Marc Andreessen recently and he said, what did he say? I just had a complete mental blank. I need more tea. He said a lot of very interesting things. You will hear about them another time because I just had a complete premature Alzheimer\u2019s moment so that\u2019s going to have to be a footnote for later. What are you most excited about right now? Kevin Kelly: I\u2019m going to take that in the professional sense. Tim Ferriss: You can take it in any sense. No, I really mean that. Kevin Kelly: Well, in the personal sense, I\u2019m still very excited about Asia. Asia is the culmination for me of the future. You asked me before about \u2013 I go to China to hear what the future will be and also because I have a love for the Asian traditions that are disappearing very fast and I\u2019m trying to record them. So I go to Asia to photograph these disappearing traditions, ceremonies, and what not. Tim was just joking that I came back from Kerala, India, where I was photographing these massive elephant precessions that the temples have, with 40 elephants parading through and all kinds of ceremonies. I don\u2019t know how long they can continue that. It\u2019s a very expensive, elaborate spectacle, not just in one place but throughout the rural areas. It\u2019s like other areas that as they become modern, some of these traditions become hard to hold onto. I\u2019m not nostalgic about wanting to keep them or protect them, I just want to record them, because I think they will go away. So that excites me. I\u2019m working on another book, and that\u2019s personally something I love to do for joy. That\u2019s the only reason. Just because I love to record and document these things and see them. But the other thing I\u2019m excited about in the world of the future is AI. I can\u2019t overestimate or over-enthuse on the disruptive nature that I think AI will be in the broadest sense. Many people use analogies and I have several analogies, but the one that maybe would make sense to most people was the industrial revolution was this huge thing from the world of agriculture, where we used our own physical muscles and the muscles of animals to get things done. And then we had this thing where we automated that with artificial power, artificial electric power, and steam power, and later gasoline power. This is artificial animal power, artificial human power that we used to make our lives so much easier and so much different. Everything our whole lives \u2013 in fact this house has been built using this automated power. Imagine if you had to make it by hand; it\u2019s just insane we couldn\u2019t do it. So all these motors and the harnessing of that power propelled this industrial revolution in the modern world that we have. 150 years ago, farmers would take an item, like a hand pump, and say we\u2019ll make it electric. So they took things and they electrified them. What we are doing now, we\u2019re at the very beginning of it, is we\u2019re going to take all the things that we electrified and we\u2019re now going to cognify them. We\u2019re going to add intelligence to them. Everything \u2013 and not just things that are electric, but even inert things, like a chair, like the door. People laugh, or they say you\u2019re going to put a computer in a door? 20 years ago or 30 years ago. Yes, go to a hotel today, there is a computer in your door, there is a little card reader. So we\u2019re just going to keep adding this and it\u2019s going to get smarter and smarter in multiple different ways. So that intelligence, what I call artificial smartness, is not human intelligence. It\u2019s like artificial power. It\u2019s like synthetic learning. It\u2019s just very specific, narrow, brute force kind of intelligence. So while we can think of our lives as having \u2013 when you drive a car, it\u2019s what? 240 horse power? You have 240 horses at your disposal. Then we are going to do the same thing with AI like you\u2019re going to have like 250 minds right here to do whatever it is that you want to think about or solve. You just hire this. And so it will be like electricity in the sense that you\u2019re not going to make the AI, you\u2019re going to buy it from the cloud. Tim Ferriss: It will be like Amazon web services. Kevin Kelly: Exactly. In fact, Google is selling their AI. You can purchase AI from Google today. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do, yes; $.60 cents per thousand instances. Tim Ferriss: Really? Kevin Kelly: Yes. Google AI can do amazing things, like it can look at a picture and tell you what\u2019s going on in that picture. And you can actually ask it questions. You can say what\u2019s that person wearing? What color is that hat? What are they doing with it? And then it will tell you back \u2013 $.60 a thousand. Tim Ferriss: So what would your response be to those who have fear of the rise of the machines? Skynet and creating the summoning of demons that we can\u2019t control, etc. How would you respond to that or comment on it? Kevin Kelly: I would say first of all, it\u2019s possible but very unlikely. Tim Ferriss: Why do you say that? Kevin Kelly: A lot of reasons. One is that the general trend is that automation, including this AI, will create more jobs than it destroys. It will take a lot of jobs away. I think in 20 years, at least 50 percent of the people driving trucks will no longer drive trucks. And by the way, truck driving is the most common occupation in the US. Tim Ferriss: I did not know that. Kevin Kelly: So 50 percent of those won\u2019t have jobs. Especially long-haul trucks and stuff like that. So there will be jobs. I like to think that there are tasks that are going to be taken away. So automation, including white-collar tasks like mortgage, people working in banks all this kind of stuff, anything. If you have a job that\u2019s defined by productivity or efficiency, that\u2019s a job that is going to go to AI. So productivity is for robots, okay? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Kelly: Productivity is for robots. What humans are going to be really good at are asking questions, being creative and experiences. So almost everything in our world right now is becoming cheaper and cheaper in cost. The few things that are increasing in cost are all experience based \u2013 tickets to a concert, tickets to Hamilton, and tickets to travel, personal coaching, nursing care, and weddings. Those are the things going up in price because they\u2019re not commodifiable, they\u2019re not able to be manufacturable \u2013 they are experienced based. They\u2019re not efficient. Science is terribly inefficient. You\u2019re not learning anything unless you\u2019re making mistakes; that\u2019s inefficient by definition. Innovation is inherently inefficient, so we will move to those things, and they don\u2019t all have to be highbrow. Again, nursing care, being a companion for someone, giving them attention, giving them an experience, so there is a big room there. But I think we\u2019re going to move away from things that are being measured in terms of efficiency because anything that\u2019s concerned with efficiency, whether its white-collar, knowledge work, or physical work, goes to the robots. Tim Ferriss: What has been the most impressive VR experience or profound that you\u2019ve had? Kevin Kelly: So this is a good question, because I saw them all and I saw \u201cThe Secret of Magic Leap,\u201d which had a really good visual representation, but it turns out \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Magic Leap being augmented reality? Kevin Kelly: They call it mixed reality, because it\u2019s the kind where you have a clear glass that you\u2019re wearing. Like Google glass, but you have a full vision and there is synthetic or an artificial object or a being or something in your vision. So we could be looking around this room and I will have these glasses on and I could see either a virtual screen, or a virtual tea cup, or a virtual book, or a virtual animal and it would look \u2013 it would be really present. Tim Ferriss: For people who want to just get a sample of this, I\u2019m sure you could just Google it, but there is also a really, I thought, a good piece written by Chris Dixon on \u201cWhat\u2019s Coming Next in Computing,\u201d I think was the title, the headline, and there is a little animated gif of Magic Leaps. Kevin Kelly: Magic Leaps, right. Tim Ferriss: A demonstration of this little sort of, it looks like a Japanimation robot hanging out under someone\u2019s desk. Kevin Kelly: Desk, right. It\u2019s very vivid and I saw the robot and so there are several things about where it doesn\u2019t work. Where they have to improve is that object is not lit in the same way as the rest of the room, so there is a little mismatch. To light that thing and render it in real time with the light in the room \u2013 we are way off on that. So what you have is you have an artificial thing that\u2019s really there. It\u2019s like having a cartoon thing. You know it\u2019s not really real but it really is there. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Kevin Kelly: Yeah, but that\u2019s very useful. If you\u2019re designing a prototype and you can actually walk around and you can have a virtual screen. So they talk about this being the \u201clast screen\u201d because within it, if you wear these goggles you can have virtual screens that are very highly detailed. I could watch an HD movie in it without any discomfort at all. So you can have as many screens as you want and you\u2019re interacting with them. But you just take off the goggles and they\u2019re gone. Which means you can also make them appear anywhere you want. So this is the future of work and you can actually have teleconferencing, which is another thing were you have a virtual person next to you. That is amazing and it\u2019s something I would pay, I don\u2019t know, thousands of dollars for right now if I could have that. Tim Ferriss: So were you, in general then, does that mean more impressed by the augmented reality, or mixed reality than virtual reality? Kevin Kelly: Augmented or mixed reality is the more difficult of the two to do, and if you can do mixed reality, you can do VR just by turning the lights down, making it black. So technically, VR is a subset of the mixed reality. Tim Ferriss: Understood. Kevin Kelly: Okay? So the visual accomplishment of Magic Leap is there but that wasn\u2019t the most amazing experience that I had. It turns out that the visual is only 50 percent of your sense of experience. It\u2019s the tactile; it\u2019s the audio and the feeling, and using your hands and your body. The best experience I had that was really amazing was something called the Void, based in Utah. They are making an arcade version on VR, where they provide all the equipment and you go in and you pay for an experience, say for a half an hour. You pay $30.00 for 30 minutes. And you go in and they\u2019re going to give you a full vest; you\u2019re suited up and it\u2019s amazing. It really is because they mix the real and the virtual. So let me give you an example: there\u2019s something called redirected walking. The way redirected walking is, is imagine you have your goggles on; you see something inside and you turn 90 degrees, a hard 90-degree turn to the right. But what you\u2019ll see is only an 80-degree shift. They are cheating you 10 degrees. And they can compound that cheat so that you think you\u2019re walking in a straight line for a mile across this amazing city scape. Tim Ferriss: Oh, but they have you going in a slight arc. Kevin Kelly: But you\u2019re going in a circle. Tim Ferriss: Okay, that\u2019s wild. Kevin Kelly: You\u2019re going in a circle and you don\u2019t know that. And they can do redirected touching, where you\u2019re grabbing things and you think you\u2019re grabbing different things, but it\u2019s the same thing. Or even stairs that you think you\u2019re walking up the stairs, but it\u2019s just stairs that are cycling through. Tim Ferriss: Like they\u2019re rotating. Kevin Kelly: Right. So they are able to give you a 30-minute, where you\u2019re exploring this incredible thing, and it\u2019s just a little tiny room. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Kevin Kelly: Okay? And here\u2019s the other cool thing they did in this. So you\u2019re wearing this vest, this haptic vest that\u2019s vibrating and doing all kinds of stuff. They had you go up this elevator and you\u2019re on the second story and it\u2019s kind of like this Indiana Jones demo that I saw. And there is this floor right before you and it\u2019s rocky and it\u2019s not very stable and you need to get across and you\u2019re walking across and you fall down two stories. And what happens is that you\u2019re on a platform that moves six inches, but you have just fallen two stories, okay? Tim Ferriss: Wow. That sounds terrifying. Kevin Kelly: Well no, it\u2019s exhilarating. Tim Ferriss: So does the floor just drop out from under you like cartoon-style? Kevin Kelly: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then you\u2019re floating for a second and then you drop? Kevin Kelly: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Oh, my god. Kevin Kelly: Well, the point of all this is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I hope they have great waivers. Kevin Kelly: The point of all this \u2013 because in only moves six inches. The point of all this is that there are all these tricks to what we assign our own believability of what is real, where we are. Just like cinema exploits a trick of our vision. You think Mickey Mouse, which is not a real character, is throwing a baseball, and you see that ball as really moving across the screen but there is no movement right? There is only a series of still images that we can assemble in our brain. VR is exploiting that similar set of new discoveries so our bodies believe that these things are happening. Our minds know. Tim Ferriss: Well it\u2019s like going from optical illusions to full-body sensory illusions. Kevin Kelly: Exactly. And this turns out to be very important. So what I say is and what I discovered from looking at this VR, is that we are moving from an internet of information where you can get any information anywhere in the world. Anybody who lives anywhere can have all the information they want, to an internet of experiences. These are very powerful experiences. So it\u2019s not just the experience of horror or falling, but all kinds of other experiences that we\u2019re going to have. And when you\u2019re there, you come out of these VR and it\u2019s not that you remember seeing something, you remember something happening to you. It\u2019s a much different presence. In fact first-person shooter games turn out to be a little too emotionally exhausting when you\u2019re in VR. Tim Ferriss: They produce PTSD if it gets real ugly. Kevin Kelly: Yeah. There was this VR documentary of going to a pig slaughter, and you\u2019re in the shoot with the pigs. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Kevin Kelly: People said I could watch that but I can\u2019t \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Go through it. Kevin Kelly: \u2013 go through it. I can\u2019t be in there. There was another demo someone had and it was called killing the alien where you have to stab this alien being. But there\u2019s haptics involved and stuff. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by haptic? Kevin Kelly: Haptic is this term for tactile, of sense, touch. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Kevin Kelly: They call it haptic technology and it means that when you grab something there is a response to it, or you can feel it. Tim Ferriss: Right, there\u2019s a resistance or texture. Kevin Kelly: There\u2019s a texture and there\u2019s a lot of work into how do you get that sense that you\u2019ve grab something or you can feel something. Tim Ferriss: How far do you think we are from VR sex? Kevin Kelly: Well, let me tell you. I had a great one last night. Well, there\u2019s teledildonics. Tim Ferriss: Teledildonics \u2013 where you can remotely control various sex apparatuses. Kevin Kelly: I saw these guys who have a technology for what\u2019s called volumetric capture, 3-D volumetric capture. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m getting all sorts of terrible images in my head. Kevin Kelly: Right. So volumetric capture is \u2013 they use like seven or more cameras to record a person in all their detail, so that when you see them in VR, they\u2019re moving around and you can see every single hair. Tim Ferriss: So I have been volumetrically captured before. Kevin Kelly: Live or just a snapshot? Tim Ferriss: It was a still. Kevin Kelly: That\u2019s the difference. This is not a still. Tim Ferriss: No, understood. But even the still was eerie because it was exactly me. It was mapped with \u2013 if you zoomed in you could see these tiny little grids and it was like, whoa, okay. Kevin Kelly: Right. So the volumetric capture of live movement is amazing because \u2013 and you\u2019re in a 3-D presentation of it. I felt uncomfortable even getting close to that person. Like you\u2019re in their space. You react to it; you really feel like they\u2019re there. If they\u2019re giving it eye contact and a voice, you have a total \u2013 like again, going back to the body, maybe your mind says they are not really there but your body is saying they are there, that\u2019s them. It turns out that Second Life is now doing a VR version called Sansa. It\u2019s a thousand times better than the old Second Life because those avatars are getting their body language from that person. They are getting the voice and they have the eye contact. Even if their avatar is not exactly them, you can still see them with their voice and their body movements and their micro expressions, they\u2019re really there. Tim Ferriss: When do you think the haptic technology will be at a point where \u2013 Kevin Kelly: Okay we are back to sex? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, oh yeah. Dating in San Francisco is a real pain in the ass. I could skip the pleasantries and just have \u2013 Kevin Kelly: Well, the reason I mention the volumetric capture, as I was saying, this is amazing. I was saying, sex, right? They were saying \u201cThose are the first people who had come to us. All the porno. They were the first; we have got to have that.\u201d I think I\u2019ve heard that PornHub actually has a VR channel now or something. Tim Ferriss: It wouldn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s the most popular website in the world that no one admits to going to. Kevin Kelly: Right. They have been way ahead in terms of their use of video grammar, the summaries, and stuff like that. So I haven\u2019t seen it personally, but I think that to answer your question, I\u2019m sure that right now there are probably one or two places that have probably put this together. Tim Ferriss: So if you were a betting man, if you had to be; would you say available to those who can afford it in five years? Kevin Kelly: Absolutely, less than five years, absolutely less than five years. The Void is, I think they\u2019re already opened. It\u2019s here. To outfit your whole body like this, it\u2019s doable now. I think this is going to be \u2013 things are going to be mostly regulated by economics and then the law, like where this is going to \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, things are going to get really, really messy. Kevin Kelly: Like is there someone on the other end, or is this a simulation, is this AI? Tim Ferriss: Right. Are there like actors like The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson? Are they people who are outfitted with their own haptic suits who you\u2019re interacting with? In which case, which types of laws apply? Kevin Kelly: Right and if you\u2019re in different states. I think this will be a very sticky problem. Tim Ferriss: Nice. What are people worried about right now that you think they shouldn\u2019t be worried about? The only reason I ask \u2013 Kevin Kelly: That they shouldn\u2019t be worried about? I think the idea of the AI taking over and killing us all, cross that one off. I think they shouldn\u2019t be worried about GMOs, cross that one off. Tim Ferriss: They should not be worried? Kevin Kelly: They should not be worried about GMOs. We genetically modify all the crops that you\u2019re eating. We do them in different ways. We do it through breeding or whatever it is, but they\u2019ve all been modified. Actually, if you want to modify the crops, modifying their genes with CRISPR is a lot better than trying to modify then with breeding because with breeding you have no control over what happens. Tim Ferriss: It is a much more elegant process. So CRISPR you\u2019re not concerned about? Kevin Kelly: No. There are things I am concerned about. In fact, I just saw a documentary last night which will be released pretty soon it\u2019s called Zero Days. The theme of it \u2013 it\u2019s very well done, not sensational \u2013 it looks at the Stuxnet virus, which was a computer virus that was invented, developed by the US and Israel to demolish the Uranium processing centrifuges in Iran. The message is, they were looking at can you really destroy physical things with a computer virus? The answer is yes, you absolutely can. We are at the point where you can actually affect the physical infrastructure with computers. Then the question is, what the rules are for that? And is that an act of war? Tim Ferriss: Like the Geneva Convention. Kevin Kelly: Right. And it turns out there are no rules. And yet, the US and others are developing these technologies and nobody wants to talk about them because they\u2019re all classified and therefore, no one wants to admit to it. Therefore, you can\u2019t even have a conversation about it. And yet Iran retaliated. They made the largest cyber army in response to the efforts to take them down, which did not work in the end. So there already is cyber-warfare going on, but it\u2019s not being talked about, it\u2019s not being admitted. The US government won\u2019t talk about the offensive. There are all the other countries that are now building capacity. And what are the rules? Is it okay to disrupt the banking system? There\u2019s going to be collateral damage. What\u2019s accepted? I think that we don\u2019t have any rules for cyber war is something I\u2019m really worried about. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I remember at a conference a few years ago, this very well-respected technologist got up and talked about precisely this, cyber warfare and some of the scarier scenarios and the potential tactics that could be used. For instance, if there were a natural disaster in San Francisco and people went to Google (assuming there was still internet connectivity) to try to determine how to respond. If someone could initiate the disaster somehow and then also figure out a way to present certain search results that were misinformation, maybe even more elaborate than is necessary. Like maybe that\u2019s the 007 bad guy, like \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you here with this sophisticated laser set-up while I go have a sandwich. Mr. Bond, I\u2019ll see you in 20 minutes,\u201d and then he gets away? Maybe it\u2019s a lot simpler than that. Maybe it\u2019s taking out electrical grids with different types of viruses or electromagnetic pulse weaponry. Or, for that matter, I\u2019ve been astonished at how vulnerable a lot of this stuff is to just long-range marksmanship, for instance. It\u2019s like old technology applied to an increasingly fragile, in some capacities, internet of things. Kevin Kelly: Right, exactly. So when you introduce AI into that, as the US Pentagon has just got some funding to have AI do this kind of stuff; to weaponize AI, basically. I\u2019m also worried about that. Kill decisions, this idea of right now we have legally mandated assassinations in the US. We have assassinated US citizens, okay? Tim Ferriss: Can you elaborate on that? Kevin Kelly: With the drones. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Kevin Kelly: The drone program will take out a declared individual. We killed what\u2019s his name? He was an American Citizen in Yemen, I guess? And they targeted him and they killed him. There was no trial; there was nothing. So we now have assassination. But these drones usually have people back in Nevada steering them. And they usually have generals and there\u2019s a whole chain of command involved in the kill decision. But increasingly there is pressure to expand this kind of warfare because you don\u2019t have to have troops on the ground. The American public seems much more sympathetic to sponsoring warfare this \u2013 and as that increases, there is a need to have autonomous. So there\u2019s a very long feedback loop to come back and have humans decide on this or that. If you could have autonomous AI-driven drones that didn\u2019t need that, then they could actually be making these decisions. That\u2019s scary; that\u2019s very scary. Tim Ferriss: Do you think just because this is also a topic of common debate in Silicon Valley in the AI circles. There were some people who say if you look at DeepMind or some of these other AI-focused groups in the US, they have ethics committees; they are collaborating with one another to look at safeguards. The real people you need to be worried about are sort of the fast-moving solo acts in places like China; in places like fill-in-the-blank, who do not have that safety-first mentality. And people would argue that maybe that\u2019s not the case in the US either in certain places. But if someone is going to cause a big mess with AI, what are the characteristics of that? Kevin Kelly: AI is still so early in it that I wouldn\u2019t hazard a guess, but I do acknowledge and I would emphasize that this is a global enterprise, and the Chinese are very keen on making AI. The three ingredients you need for AI these days are these deep neural nets, like DeepMind. And then you need huge farms of GPUs, graphical processing units, which have been commoditized but the video game industry. Tim Ferriss: Like in video chips. Kevin Kelly: It turns out there are parallel processors that are really affordable. So before, AI was done on super computer parallels that would cost millions and millions of dollars. Then it turns out that these little video chips that you make for video games were parallel processing and they were really cheap. So now they buy these big farms of these cheap video game processors. So you need lots of those. And then you need big data. Big data is sort of the rocket fuel. So the companies like Baidu and Alibaba, who have big data, are actually able to do this kind of AI right now. I think there\u2019s no monopoly on AI right now. China, Europe, even Japan, will all get into this business and I would expect, just given history, that there will be a disaster, an AI disaster of some sort. Tim Ferriss: I mean it\u2019s inevitable, right? It\u2019s not to say that AI shouldn\u2019t be pursued; it\u2019s just like anything else. Kevin Kelly: Someone will abuse it. Tim Ferriss: If you\u2019re going to have large-scale water projects, there\u2019s going to be some horrible flood that\u2019ll kill a bunch of people or a fill-in-the-blank disaster. Kevin Kelly: Right. So we have to be ready for that and not freak out about it, which is what I think one of the tendencies will be. Okay, stop AI, research, no more federal funding AI. That will also happen, too. People will respond to that by saying we have to stop AI. Tim Ferriss: If you had to again, sort of play Nostradamus a little bit, what do you think the first few big wins of AI will be? Where people will really step back and go, whoa. Kevin Kelly: Yes. It\u2019s going to be, well, two things. I think there will be these huge big wins. But what\u2019s very curious about this is that whenever these wins happen, as they have in the past, then immediately we don\u2019t call it AI. AI is only what we can\u2019t do. What we hope to do is called AI, and once we do it, it\u2019s called machine learning. So the first big win will be a translation. We\u2019ll have a little device that we can wear in our ear and it will hear you speaking Chinese and it will whisper to me English. We\u2019ll have that in, I don\u2019t know, five years or so. But we\u2019re not going to call it AI; no, that\u2019s not AI. They\u2019re just dumb computers doing this stuff. It\u2019s no longer AI. People don\u2019t think of SIRI as AI. That\u2019s just machine learning. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s just SIRI. Kevin Kelly: Driving the car \u2013 that\u2019s no longer AI. Of course computers can drive a car; of course they can play chess. Because once it happens, it\u2019s like of course. That\u2019s obviously not AI. AI is always what we can\u2019t do. So there will be these wins like perfect translation. That will be very common. And talking to these assistant bots; that\u2019s the other thing. You\u2019ll have these conversations \u2013 let\u2019s do this, do that, Echo. Tim Ferriss: I was going to say it sounds a lot like early innovation of Echo. Kevin Kelly: Right, okay. Is that AI? Do people think of it as AI? No, that\u2019s not AI, that\u2019s just Echo, whatever it is. So I think that conversation is the interface mostly to AI for a very long time and we will get really good at that. I think people will ignore it. It will become invisible to them. I think most of the AI will be invisible, like we were talking about Amazon web services. It\u2019s going to be behind the scenes, it\u2019s going to be very particular. I mean right now, your calculator is smarter than you are in arithmetic. It doesn\u2019t freak you out, right? Right? It\u2019s great. Google is better than you in recall. So we have this very specific artificial smartness and that\u2019s where a lot of this is. Most of the AI is not like human intelligence; that is why we are making it. The whole point is to think different, to make things think differently than us. The reason why we want these AI to drive cars is because they aren\u2019t driving like humans. They aren\u2019t worried about whether they left the stove on or having an argument with the garage. They are just driving better than we can drive. So we\u2019ll make a lot of the stuff that does things that are not \u2013 I mean, like when Google is remembering all the webpages in the world, that\u2019s inhuman. It\u2019s not anything we can do. So a lot of this stuff will be \u2013 and once we see the machines doing it, we\u2019ll say well, obviously, we weren\u2019t the only ones who could do that, but now it\u2019s all in retrospect. Tim Ferriss: Right. Do you, and this is a total left turn, but do you journal? Is that a practice that you have or not really? Kevin Kelly: It\u2019s an occasional practice and something that I do occasionally at night, late at night. Tim Ferriss: When do you do it? Meaning what triggers it? What are the occasions that you decide to journal? Kevin Kelly: I\u2019m trying to figure out; I haven\u2019t been able to determine the trigger, but sometimes I\u2019ll just be seized with this kind of, I need to sit down and just journal stuff and write stuff and doddle. I haven\u2019t been able to detect a pattern, but I have a book that I use and it\u2019s called late night. I usually do it late night, very late and just kind of I don\u2019t know. Maybe there is a buffer that gets filled or something. Tim Ferriss: You have to unload it. You have to delete the download folder. Kevin Kelly: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Start-up disk almost full. Better get this into my journal. What change in your life or behavioral modification are you proudest of in the last year or recent memory? And which habits or behaviors are you trying to change? Kevin Kelly: Good question. I think I\u2019m working on; I was Mark Zuckerberg who had this kind like he was going to give a thank you note every day for 30 days or something. So this idea of consciously really trying to express gratitude in a disciplined way is something I have been working on to try to make it more of a habit. Tim Ferriss: How do you express gratitude? Is it a phone call? Is it a text message? Kevin Kelly: Generally, it has been an email. I\u2019m not a phone person. I don\u2019t like voicemail; I don\u2019t like talking on the phone. I came into my professional life \u2013 I was basically noticed online in writing short, telegraphic, email-ish stuff. So for some reason, email is my medium and I\u2019m most comfortable with email. Tim Ferriss: So gratitude. Well, on that note, I want to thank you for taking time to have yet another jam session. I always have a blast. What are you up to right now? What would you like people to check out? Where can they find you? Kevin Kelly: So I have this book that will be released June 6th. It\u2019s called The Inevitable. Published by Viking. It\u2019s, I think, a pretty good outline of the technological trends for the next 20 or 30 years at the highest level; things that we can\u2019t ignore and that we really should be embracing. I think if you are interested in what\u2019s coming, that you will really find it very useful because it\u2019s not really technical. It\u2019s at a high level. And if you\u2019re looking to where things will be in 20 years, I think I have a pretty good map of where that\u2019s going. Tim Ferriss: So where can people grab it? I\u2019m sure by the time they hear this, they can grab it on Amazon. And where else? kk.org? Kevin Kelly: Yeah, so kk.org is my homepage and where I hangout. And there\u2019ll be links if you want other languages or the Audible version, the Kindle. I think that it all should be listed there and I may even have a calendar-ish thing going and where I\u2019m going to be. Tim Ferriss: Showing what you\u2019re up and speaking engagements or whatever. Kevin Kelly: Right, and in July I\u2019m going to be doing a bunch of stuff, basically appearing on a gazillion podcasts. I\u2019ve dedicated that for the month of July. Tim Ferriss: This is why I like to do mine early. Kevin Kelly: Yes, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Another exclusive Tim Ferriss Show opportunity. Kevin Kelly: This is an exclusive. I\u2019m so delighted, Tim, that you reached out and made the invitation to be at your glorious home. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m thrilled to have you here. Kevin Kelly: I hope that it was useful to the listeners out there because we did kind of go all over the place. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s why they come. They come for the OCD plus the ADHD with a dash of hopefully, definitely intelligence from my guests, and occasionally a glimmer of something approaching semi-intelligence on my part. But everybody check out kk.org. It\u2019s full of all sorts of things that I have recommended many times over the years, including \u201c1,000 True Fans,\u201d of course and much more than that; the \u201cQuantified Self,\u201d everything can be found somewhere at the hub that is kk.org. Where on social media if somebody wanted to say hello would be the best place to say hello? Kevin Kelly: I do look at the Twitter stream and I\u2019m kevin2kelly. I have Facebook which I don\u2019t look at as much. But actually, I do look at Google Plus. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you do? Kevin Kelly: I do because I find that the comments and the conversation is very high quality. Even though there\u2019s not that many people, those that are there are very active and I pay attention. Tim Ferriss: So Kevin Kelly \u2013 if they just search Kevin Kelly on Google Plus? Kevin Kelly: Yeah, I\u2019m Kevin Kelly on Google Plus. Tim Ferriss: Perfect, all right. Maybe we\u2019ll put that in the show notes. So everybody listening, you can find everything we\u2019ve talked about, assuming I can track it down, in the show notes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. You can also find links to our previous conversations. We had two very fun conversations, where we went a lot into Kevin\u2019s bio and asked a lot of my usual rapid fire questions that we\u2019ve already covered previously. You can find that and much, much more at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. Kevin, firstly thank you very much also for taking the time. I always have so much fun. And to everyone listening, as always and until next time, thank you so much for making The Tim Ferriss Show a part of your daily podcast experience.

life most interesting man in the world", "i\u2019m not making up what i\u2019m about to read to you", "he is senior maverick at wired magazine, which he co-founded in 1993", "he also co-founded the all species foundation, a non-profit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth", "in his spare time \u2013 of course i\u2019m using that tongue and cheek \u2013 he writes bestselling books, many of them", "he co-founded the rosetta project, which is building an archive of all documented human languages, and serves on the board of the long now foundation", "as part of the last, he\u2019s investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species including the wooly mammoth", "that is not made up, folks", "we touch on a lot of really fun stuff in the episode", "when kevin arrived at my house to record, i had certain plans and i asked him what he wanted to highlight or focus on and we just decided to catch up, as friends", "so this is very truly the type of conversation that led me, in the first place, many moons ago to ask, why don\u2019t i record these and share these conversations", "because i have so much fun catching up with friends like kevin", "this is about as close to a banter over drinks as you\u2019re going to get, in my life certainly, putting this out publicly", "so i hope you enjoy it", "we touch on all sorts of things: stories about jeff bezos and his email management approach, favorite books, impactful books, tech literacy, why there are \u201cno vr experts,\u201d which is very inspiring", "there is a video that didn\u2019t make it into this interview but kevin mentioned afterward that i think is \u201cthe history of japan in nine minutes\u201d that i highly recommend everybody check out", "we talk about the evolution of china, why he spends so much time in china, artificial intelligence, network effects, virtual reality, gmo, we talk about everything", "if you think i am the only big fan of kevin, well of course that\u2019s not true", "here is a little bit of praise for his most recent book called the inevitable and these are real quotes", "i\u2019ll truncate some of them", "so here we go: \u201canyone can claim to be a prophet, a fortune teller or a futurist, and plenty of people do", "what makes kevin kelly different is that he\u2019s right.\u201d it goes on and on", "that\u2019s david pogue; many of you will know", "then we have \u201ckevin kelly has been predicting our technological future with uncanny prescience for years", "now he gives us a glimpse of how the next three decades will unfold.\u201d that\u2019s ernest cline, author of ready player one", "and then also referring to the book (the inevitable, that is) marc andreessen (who i had on the podcast recently), co-founder of andreessen horowitz and technological icon, refers to it as \u201can automatic must read.\u201d so i hope you enjoy this very informal and wide-ranging conversation with none other than kevin kelly", "if you want to listen to a longer conversation where i dig into his bio and learn all sorts of nuggets that even i didn\u2019t know, then you can check out fourhourworkweek.com/kevin", "just go to fourhourworkweek.com/ kevin and you can find previous conversations with him", "enjoy", "kevin, welcome back to the show", "it\u2019s always a pleasure, tim", "it\u2019s so great to be here", "fantastic low horizontal space", "thank you", "it\u2019s great to have you in my house for a change", "i remember still the very first quantified self meet-up at your place in pacifica with however many people it was", "there were twenty-five people that showed up with a call to \u201cif you think you\u2019re quantifying yourself, come.\u201d tim was one of the people who arrived", "it was a broad spectrum of folks", "it was; it was really good", "we had no idea what to expect", "this is gary wolf and i, probably eight or nine years ago", "that was the very first meeting of the quantified self movement", "it was a meeting in my studio in pacifica", "where is quantified self now", "what is the scope of that", "there\u2019s meetings in almost 300 cities around the world", "amazing", "we have an international conference once a year", "so it\u2019s entered into vocabulary \u2013 that is, people talk about it \u2013 whether for or against it", "there are of course tons and tons of hardware sensors", "the last ces before this year was called the quantified self ces because there were so many wearables", "the apple watch being one of many", "so it sort of entered into the mainstream in a certain sense", "it remains to be seen where it goes next", "you\u2019re probably not wearing your fitbit today", "i\u2019m not", "some people have spells with this where they find it useful and the question is, how deep can these sensors go so they are something that everybody does", "it\u2019s the new normal", "i think we\u2019re still a ways from that", "i don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far away from it being opt-out though instead of opt-in", "right", "for most people \u2013 actually, you\u2019re already quantifying yourself, because you have an iphone with an accelerometer that has location tracking and so on", "exactly", "the fascination i have with your life extends in many different directions", "but one is there\u2019s the kevin kelly futurist, technologist; and then there\u2019s the kevin kelly, and they\u2019re one in the same of course, but another aspect of you which sends me your family letters", "i love getting these letters", "they read like fiction, quite frankly", "it\u2019s straight out of rin tin tin", "i remember just recently getting a text from you and it was from a number i didn\u2019t recognize", "what did it say", "\u201ci just finished tracking elephants\u201d", "temple procession elephants in kerala", "and i\u2019m on my way to oman tomorrow or whatever", "yeah, \u201cwould you like to come?\u201d i was like \u201ci\u2019m sorry, who this is?\u201d you\u2019ve spent time with the amish", "we\u2019ve talked about this in episodes; in the first episode we did together, certainly", "but at the same time, we can get really granular and tactical; but first, before we go to \u2013 i have a question about email and books and hamilton and so on", "why do you spend so much time in china", "you\u2019ve written a little about this in your family letter updates, but you seem to spend every year more and more time in china", "and why do they love you so much", "yes, okay", "so it\u2019s a very complicated reason", "my connection to china is kind of deep", "starting with the fact that my wife is chinese and my kids are all bilingual and have spent time in china", "but more importantly, i wrote a book called out of control twenty-five years ago or maybe more now, 1994, i guess", "it was a little early because it was about how the internet was going to happen before the internet really happened", "it was about how these decentralized, sharing things were going to \u2013 they were almost biologically inspired, and they were going to go into our built environment", "that\u2019s what i was talking about", "i was talking about all the rules that the internet were going to run by before there was internet", "it never really took off in the us, but it was translated into chinese, crowd source translated about five years ago", "it was just at the right time when honi ma, jack ma, and all these guys in china were starting their internet companies", "they read the book in chinese and were influenced by it and talked about it", "there\u2019s kind of a little bit of a social herd mentality in china", "so when these famous successes were talking about this book \u2013 i don\u2019t think we do that at all in the u.s", "exactly, right", "everybody started to buy it", "so i became, for better or worse, kind of the alvin toffler of china", "they have this ridiculous idea that i\u2019m predicting the future", "because, in fact, there were very little predictions in the book", "it was just that i was talking about things that later on became common", "so they have this idea \u2013 they always introduce me as the guy who invented the internet or who predicted the internet", "of course, the next person who introduces me has to ratchet that up even higher, so it\u2019s embarrassing at this point", "i have a lot of fans in china who are trying really hard to be innovative", "they\u2019re listening to people from the west \u2013 not just me \u2013 about how to do that in their culture", "so my book has become one of those books that they are reading to understand where it\u2019s going because they are rushing into that future so fast that they really need all the guidance they can get", "for people who don\u2019t know toffler, can you give a little context", "yeah", "so alvin toffler wrote a book called future shock in the \u201870s or \u201880s", "i don\u2019t remember where it was", "but he, in some ways, for a long time was the most famous futurist; and even people who didn\u2019t know what he was talking about knew him as a futurist", "so if you knew about a futurist, it was alvin toffler, even though you hadn\u2019t read his book", "i have the same thing in china where people might recognize my name and call me a futurist, even though they have never read anything by him", "so alvin toffler\u2019s book future shock is still worth reading", "he was the one who introduced the term \u2018future shock\u2019 which was that people would actually have like a resistance or a reaction to the future, in general, just because things were changing fast", "but he also invented, in that same book or the next one, the idea or the term \u201cprosumer.\u201d which is a person who is both producing and consuming, which we now call user-generated content", "but this idea that most of this economy would be prosumers", "that was his idea in like the \u201870s or \u201880s, so he was way ahead", "that\u2019s incredible", "yeah", "how do you see china changing in the next 10 to 20 years", "i believe that china is within five years on the cusp of actually having a global brand of something that everybody in the world would want", "meaning a nike, a fill in the blank", "yeah exactly, whether it\u2019s a car or a drone, or a camera, or some appliance, or device, or digital thing that would be world-class in its innovation, in its quality", "like sony became eventually for the japanese", "the reason why i think that is because, as you said, i go there a lot", "i\u2019m going there probably every three months", "i\u2019m not just going to the big cities, which i do my talks at, but i will always take an extra week or two and go out to the hinterlands", "out to yunnan or guangxi or some other province", "i spent some time on the silk road way in the west, where it\u2019s muslim, to get a sense of the other china and to gauge the depth of their dream", "what do the chinese want", "they are going so fast, where are they aiming for", "what they are trying to do is innovate", "they are coming to the west to learn how to innovate", "i think like we taught the japanese how to do quality", "the japanese said, how do we do quality", "so they went to taylor and all these guys gave them a list of \u201cdo this and do this, and do this, and you\u2019ll have quality.\u201d the japanese went through their list, they did it, and then they became the world\u2019s expert on making quality", "the chinese are saying, how do we do innovation", "all the people from the west, \u201cyou need to have science fairs and you have to have innovation hubs", "you have to have start-ups", "you have to have all this stuff", "so they\u2019re going down the checklist: we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019re going to do that", "i think they are doing it and they are going to succeed in making something that we all want", "i don\u2019t know what it is, but i feel that they\u2019re really doing all the things that they wanted to do, although there are two cultural characters that they haven\u2019t yet gotten to", "and those two cultural ones are that they haven\u2019t yet embraced failure and they still don\u2019t collectively question authority enough", "they\u2019re working on those and they know that they have to do those and they know that those are difficult to do collectively", "individually of there\u2019s no problem", "the chinese come to america, they can do all of this; but collectively as a culture, those are challenging for them", "they\u2019re working on them", "it\u2019ll be some more years but i think they will do it", "now if you look at, let\u2019s say singapore, i know we are getting pretty china-focused here, but as a sidebar you were talking about visiting these sort of far flung corners of china", "china \u2013 just for those people who are listening who haven\u2019t been \u2013 is a lot more diverse than you might think", "in fact, when you hear chinese, the language for instance, like mandarin chinese \u2013 it\u2019s basically beijing dialect chinese", "on top of that, if you were to go to china, there are many ways to say chinese depending on where you are", "it indicates a lot of how you feel", "so you could say like [speaking chinese] like center, the center county, middle kingdom language", "then you can also say like [speaking chinese] so the language of the han people who are the dominant ethnic group", "[speaking chinese]", "[speaking chinese] if you go to taiwan", "now the mainlanders hate that", "if you say [speaking chinese] that means kind of like the mainland talk", "i mean i\u2019m translating very liberally here", "that, of course, really irks the chinese who view taiwan as a rogue province that is nonetheless still a part of them, much like quebec or something in canada", "the other point that i was going to make, or question, rather, that i was going to impose is, if you look at singapore", "singapore has tried with some success for at least i would say the last ten years to replicate silicon valley", "they\u2019ve faced very similar cultural hurdles, but they have fantastic, at least my impression is, financial resources", "they have unilateral freedom to do whatever they want", "they have a well-educated population", "they are very, very, very small, right", "the sandbox is incredibly small", "you can walk around singapore in a day and then you\u2019re like what am i going to do here", "i need to go to malaysia to have a new meal", "why will china differ", "is it just the sheer number of people that they have to choose from or to filter from, from which you can find the michael jordans, the jeff bezos, the fill-in-the-blank", "absolutely, i think this is an arithmetic problem", "i mean, 1.4 billion people", "by the way there\u2019s like .3 billion north americans", "there\u2019s a billion more of them", "i think there definitely is a critical mass, a scale that the chinese have", "it\u2019s almost translated into a momentum that you need and that you have this critical mass of people behind you doing", "you were mentioning the diversity, which singapore does not have as much of, but it does have a lot for being a little city, but not compared to china", "you have a huge diversity in china, as you were saying", "not just the language, but even ethnically, geographically", "so i think they have all those necessary requirements, the requisite complexity that you would need to make something", "but i would say two things: one is, if they attempt to make another silicon valley, i think that fails", "there are network effects in all these things and the network effect says that the best get bigger", "and the bigger you get, the better you get", "and the better you get, the bigger you get", "so you have this sort of compounding acceleration", "that means that there is only going to be one or two dominant players", "by the way, ai is going to be a network effects phenomenon", "social media is a network effect phenomenon", "the kind of start-up culture is a network effect phenomenon in a particular category.\nso if they try to do a silicon valley for software, it will not happen", "if they decide to take something, which i think they might, like robotics or aviation, or biotech, and really develop and grow to a sufficient scale, i think they could have an equivalent", "right now they do have one in manufacturing", "right", "the pearl river delta area from guangzhou to shenzhen", "hong kong that is, that is basically one they do the world\u2019s best manufacturing in china", "it\u2019s not because it\u2019s the cheapest, it\u2019s because it\u2019s the best and they have this whole ecosystem, with thousands and thousands of suppliers and dynamic real time inventory control and this whole thing", "they do have the silicon valley for manufacturing in that area, and they will continue to grow that and people are going there not because they\u2019re the cheapest, in some cases they aren\u2019t, but because they have the absolute best in manufacturing", "how much of the \u2013 and this is for those people listening", "kevin and i decided to wing it", "we had a conversation prior to recording and this is just us talking about stuff that we\u2019re interested in", "i\u2019ve been, over the last few weeks, discussing with folks visiting silicon valley and the origins of silicon valley, or trying my best to explain why silicon valley may have happened here and not elsewhere", "how much of silicon valley do you think can be attributed to a handful of companies that just happened to land here, like fairchild or some of these semiconductor companies", "the inability to enforce non-compete contracts in california, which i think allowed these people to then split off and form many other companies that might have stepped on their former bosses\u2019 territory or other", "when somebody asks you why did silicon valley happen here, what do you say", "so there are reasons why", "there was actually a really good book on this by annalee saxenian, i believe her name was", "she studied route 128 around boston and silicon valley and compared the two", "because route 128 actually had a little head start in this kind of tech world", "why didn\u2019t they become the silicon valley", "why didn\u2019t sand hill road kill them", "yeah, and part of the reason; there\u2019s a number of different reasons, but one of them was because, i think you mentioned a couple but there\u2019s others", "and that was silicon valley was so far from the west coast government, the d.c", "government that they \u2013 or the east coast government", "excuse me, the east coast government, d.c", "\u2013 that they had to find a whole bunch of different sources for funding", "they invented the funding model", "which 128 around boston was still locked into a lot of the government defense contracts", "right", "okay", "so that was kind of the difficulty, but a liberation for silicon valley, where it was really divorced from the government hand-outs or government subsidies, the government funding", "not completely, but enough to actually really develop this other, alternative way of financing things", "venture capital", "right, venture capital", "i think psychologically there was this other division, this other kind of divorcing from the whole california story of no adult supervision, not asking for permission, which started with the \u201849ers and before", "i think that also continued to influence the culture", "so there was a cultural innovation", "many people say that the greatest invention from silicon valley was not the transistor or software, it was this model", "it was this innovation model", "that is the kind of meta \u2013 the innovation model meaning the set of beliefs and maxims and so on that those people carried in their heads", "exactly, right", "the venture funding model, the startup model, this method, this culture that would reward", "the joke was you change your job and you walk across the street", "and also the fact that you were encouraged to change your job", "far from lifelong employment, but this idea that you\u2019ve been here a couple years, time to move on", "so there was a whole bunch of things that are ingredients to that", "this book studied this in a more economically rigorous way of why did one surpass the other", "there\u2019s a number of fascinating documentaries on this as well and maybe it\u2019s all sort of hindsight logical, but in reality, 90 percent of it was just random collision of people and factors; i don\u2019t know", "i would also recommend john markoff\u2019s book with this really trippy title called what the dormouse said", "what the dormouse said", "which is about the hippy origins of the personal computer industry", "so there\u2019s a whole other strand which is very influential, which was the fact that the hippy generation embraced computers unlike the other technologies that they rejected", "and they embraced them from doug engelbart to steve jobs, to a lot of the ai guys", "a lot of the people in the early computer industry had a little of the hippy background and they saw these things as augmentations, as basically it\u2019s kind of like a new age way to augment the human", "so when people left the communes \u2013 they tried the communes, they didn\u2019t work", "with the long hair", "but they learned a lot of skills, including small business skills", "making their candles, and their sandals, and their macram\u00e9, selling honey or whatever it was", "so unlike people who went to college and never dropped out; who went to work for the big organizations, the ibm, they were at the craft fairs getting business skills", "then when they came along, they transferred those directly into this idea of small businesses which were not cool", "if you told somebody in the \u201850s that you were at a startup that was a code for \u201ci\u2019m unemployed, i was fired.\u201d it\u2019s like consultant right", "oh, you mean unemployed", "that was the analog", "right", "have you ever been to \u2013 i know i\u2019m jumping around here \u2013 but to christiania", "i think it\u2019s in copenhagen", "yes, in copenhagen", "so there\u2019s this area \u2013 for people who haven\u2019t been \u2013 called christiania", "i\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019m getting it roughly right", "it\u2019s effectively like a hippy/anarchist commune in the middle of or around copenhagen", "there are gates that you walk through and it says here ends the european union when you walk through", "and as you describe, it is people walking their kids around in wheelbarrows, making honey, and making candles", "they have breweries", "it\u2019s such a funky experience", "it\u2019s a little autonomous region that started off as a squatter city that is now semi-legal in some capacity and they do have their own little government at this point and it\u2019s quite extensive", "you could spend \u2013 it\u2019s not as quite as big as singapore", "it\u2019s not that far off", "right", "it\u2019s a worthy experiment to go visit because there are lots of alternative governments and structures", "cultures are really important", "let me just say one thing about travel before we go into other things", "i travel a lot, not just to china but to other places, as much as i can because i find that it really keeps my mind flexible", "in fact, i find that it\u2019s the most exercise i can do in a short amount of time than anything else", "i mean sure i can learn a new language and do all these other things", "i find you can do all of those while you\u2019re traveling too", "but travel really forces me to be flexible and to confront others and to think about things differently", "even whether if i have a different idea there, it\u2019s just the habit of trying to think and come at things differently that i find really, really useful; in addition to the fact that you actually literally are looking at your own culture from a different lens but even just the general habit of trying to let go of what you think you know", "i go to china above all else because every time i go, i actually have decided i know less than the last time", "there\u2019s so much happening there; it\u2019s happening so fast; it\u2019s so big, the chinese have no idea what\u2019s happening", "i think i know something and then i go and i realize i don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here either", "i know less than the last time i visited", "it\u2019s a different country than the last time you were there", "right", "i think travel is so important, particularly to young people that i really think it should be subsidized at the federal level", "i think gap year should be mandatory", "i think a two-year national service should be a requirement and you can fulfill it anyway you want including going overseas and working at the peace corps or a visa or whatever it is", "take two years", "want to go do military", "fine", "want to go to an inner city", "fine", "you want to go overseas", "fine", "we\u2019ll pay you for two years", "nothing would transform america as having an overseas experience for the majority of people who, by the way, don\u2019t have passports at this moment", "i agree", "i could not agree more", "we agreed on a few other things earlier when we were talking about podcast questions and i was making some funky mushroom coffee, not of the psychedelic sort, that i\u2019ll describe some other time", "but you suggested that i ask people about their email systems", "how do they handle inbound email", "right, because for ordinary people, they get a lot of email", "but if you have any level or success or notoriety or prominence, dealing with the incoming in a sane way that actually works is a real mystery to me", "people like yourself, or even the other people who get a lot of demands on them, how do you actually deal with email", "do you have more than one account", "if you have more than one account, how do you handle it", "do you have your assistant involved", "etc., etc., there are many different facets to it", "right, right", "and you mentioned you had a conversation with jeff bezos", "i said we have to save that for the podcast", "so now i have to ask, what was this conversation", "so i had the opportunity to ask jeff at some point about his email", "because i wanted to send something", "i said, \u201cwho do i send it to, how do you do your email?\u201d again, i think this is probably a ten-year-old answer", "so i can\u2019t verify this is happening", "but he said, \u201ci finally figured out what to do", "so here\u2019s is what it is, is anything you send to me,\u201d and actually, his email is fairly well-circulated", "he says, \u201canything you send to me, my assistants will read and they are in charge of responding or doing something with it.\u201d right, vetting", "no, to give the appropriate response", "\u201cbut i also read it all, and since i don\u2019t really normally answer it unless there is something", "and then if there is something that i want to respond to, i\u2019ll respond to it", "so the worst case scenario that you\u2019ll get two replies from me: from my assistant, if it needs to be replied to, and me.\u201d so in other words, everything goes in a parallel circuit; once to his assistants and they deal with what has to be (and most of it\u2019s probably going to be ignored)", "those that need to be done something, they may nudge him or whatever", "and he\u2019s also looking at it, and he can reply personally to it", "he said the worst is you might get two", "that seemed to be \u2013 he has one email and i have gotten responses to that email, and sometimes it just goes and obviously he doesn\u2019t respond to it", "into the ether", "right", "do you still have \u2013 this is something that i\u2019ve had to get increasingly better at because the tools and tactics as i laid them out, for instance, in the 4-hour workweek still work very well; however, i\u2019ve had to develop more nuanced layers on top of what i did because now it\u2019s thousands of emails coming and hitting me, my assistants, everyone", "deciding how to vet and use tools like boomerang to schedule things to be set in the future or automatic follow-ups, you name it, moving a lot of internal communication, the slack so it\u2019s separate from the inbox, etc", "do you still have an assistant and a separate researcher", "i do", "i have an assistant and a full-time researcher, but they don\u2019t do my mail, so i do all my own mail", "what is your researcher currently helping you with, if you can talk about it", "i would love to talk about it", "in fact, we just had a review today", "so i\u2019ve been working on a project", "a review meaning that you reviewed \u2013 we have an annual review", "i have an annual review with the two people who work for me", "so once a year we sit down and we do an employee review, we talk about the past year and evaluate what\u2019s coming up", "her name is camille, and what camille is working on is we are gathering every long-term forecast that we can find anywhere, in any of the industries or published anywhere", "we\u2019re bringing them together and we\u2019re going to try to integrate all the long-term forecasts into one integrated forecast of the future; long-term meaning ten years or more", "so forecasts could be anything from \u201cthis is how we see gasoline prices moving in the next 20 years,\u201d to \u201cthis is how we anticipate air travel to the number of seats filled in air travel to move in the next 20 years.\u201d right", "and we\u2019re going even broader, like the future of sports, the number of attendees at sports game, transportation", "we are going through the whole list of things", "so she\u2019s been working on it for six months and we probably have another six months of what i call the \u201cofficial future.\u201d having being trained in gbn, which was a consultancy that did strategy for global companies, the mantra was that \u201call predictions are wrong,\u201d and generally, particularly official futures; so there\u2019s official extrapolation", "you take what\u2019s been happening for the past five years and you extrapolate", "they are invariably not correct, because things jig and jag and new things are invented that disrupt the pattern", "but my premise is that while they\u2019re wrong, that they\u2019re still useful", "and they would be particularly useful if they were integrated together", "so you would say the future of transportation looks like this and the future of electric cars looks like this and they both can\u2019t be right, they have to inform each other in some ways", "so that\u2019s the next step of integrating and having these official futures inform each other and to see if i can make a scenario that\u2019s more useful out of the sum of the parts", "so she has been working on that for six months", "she also did the research when i was doing the big cover story for wired on vr", "so for five months i was trying out every single vr headset, input, content that i could and i wrote this article", "and the way wired works, like other magazines, is they have this fact checking which is sort of in some way kind of a legal cover-your-ass thing", "cover your ass thing", "which means every single statement that i make has to be verified and proven", "like a scholarly article, like a footnote, which is totally insane but that\u2019s what you have to do", "so we were involved in \u2013 you say something that seems obvious to you, there\u2019s some statement \u2013 \u201cvr, people get sick in it, or they have motion sickness.\u201d \u201ccan you prove that", "where does that come from", "how do you know about that?\u201d so she did a lot of the hard legwork in finding the documentation for these kinds of statements that aren\u2019t footnoted in the article, but actually are footnoted in what i turn over to them", "so i have a completely scholarly footnoted article", "people don\u2019t realize that, like behind the scenes of new yorker and wired and places like that, there is a huge amount of \u2013 there is a full-time staff that will fact check every single fact", "oh yeah", "it\u2019s a big, dedicated staff", "by the way, books do not do that and newspapers do not do that", "yeah", "we can spend a lot of time talking about all of that", "so going back to my assistants", "i have a researcher who does all that kind of research and anything else i need research on, which that\u2019s the main thing, but this was my one dream was to have somebody \u2013 this was even before google that i could ask \u2013 i do a lot of travel", "so they sometimes do research on simple things, like is it a sane idea to rent a car in oman or should i get a driver", "so you troll the tripadvisor boards", "the state department, [inaudible]", "it\u2019s just kind of looking around, yeah it\u2019s that kind of stuff", "how do you decide aside from those types of logistics", "how do you choose projects for your researcher to help you with", "and you could delve into anything that you\u2019d like", "so how do you choose", "like projects in general", "what am i going to do next", "sure, yeah", "how do you choose what you\u2019re going to do next", "okay", "so this has taken me a long time to get there, but one of the questions that i \u2013 well you have seen these venn diagrams of things you like to do, things that other people need", "yeah", "but for me, there is actually a third important circle", "and that\u2019s not just things that i want to do, so that has to be a key thing that i\u2019m good at doing, that\u2019s the second thing", "because there\u2019s lots of things i would have fun doing, but i\u2019m not good at", "so they have to be things i\u2019m good at", "and then there is maybe would be useful to other people", "but this other circle that\u2019s become more important to me is, can anybody else do it", "yeah, right", "if somebody else can do it, i am not going to do it", "i spend a lot of time trying to give away ideas and trying to talk about what i\u2019m doing in the hope that someone else comes along and says, \u201coh, i\u2019m doing that.\u201d that\u2019s like whew, what a relief because now i\u2019m not doing that", "it\u2019s like i\u2019m talking about this future stuff \u2013 if i could find out someone else out there \u2013 they write to me and they say \u201ci\u2019m doing that.\u201d i\u2019m like oh, my gosh, thank you", "now i don\u2019t have to do that", "and so what i\u2019m trying to look for is really good things that i would enjoy, that other people value, that nobody else is going to do", "that i can\u2019t convince anyone else to do", "they think it\u2019s a terrible idea or they think it\u2019s a lousy idea, but for some reason i think it\u2019s a good idea and i can\u2019t get anyone else to do it", "i can\u2019t talk; no one will steal it from me", "you\u2019re trying to give it away and no one will take it", "i\u2019m trying to give it away and no one\u2019s going to take it", "it\u2019s like all right, i have to do that now", "that\u2019s how i feel about books", "so i get asked, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you write a book on this", "why don\u2019t you write a book on that?\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cthere are already plenty of good books on both of those subjects.\u201d right", "it has to be something that bothers me for so long, but seems like such a crackpot idea for everybody else, i can\u2019t buy it anywhere to scratch the itch", "and i\u2019m like, okay, well \u2026 that\u2019s me", "just to fix that neurosis, i have to address it", "so titles are important and you mentioned the title of a book just a few minutes ago before we started recording that caught my attention, because we were looking at the slow creep of books and piles on my table, which is ironically right next to this marie kondo book on the japanese magic of tidying up", "let\u2019s be more accurate", "the book about cleaning up is on a stack of other stuff", "exactly", "which i took a photograph of because it\u2019s a lot better than it was", "it used to be like the trash compactor in star wars, and this book on japanese decluttering would just surf this wave of flotsam and jetsam around my house", "it\u2019s a lot better now", "but you mentioned that another book called all too much \u2013 it\u2019s all too much, and it actually preceded her book at least in english", "i thought it was so valuable, that in this really huge book i did called cool tools, i list it as the very first tool, which was how to deal with all this stuff, how not to have a bunch of stuff", "i actually gave it a whole page because i thought the message was so profound", "because it\u2019s not about tidying up and cleaning, he talks about the fact that if you have something that is valuable, you need to show it", "hiding things, if you have collections and they are not visible, then they are not working for you", "he\u2019s not against collecting things, but if you collect them they have to be prominent", "they have to bring you joy, they have to be doing something in your life", "what you want with decluttering is to remove the junk so you have room for your treasure", "all these things where it\u2019s not about the stuff", "it\u2019s about your mental state, your openness to new ideas", "and the clutter is, in some ways, prohibiting your self-fulfillment, the best you", "because it\u2019s hiding, you\u2019re buried under it", "there is this sort of \u2013 i wouldn\u2019t call it pop psychology \u2013 but it is a little bit about trying to get at the core of what you are about, what your house is about, what your life is about, and making room for these things, and the kind of that techniques he uses are very similar to what the japanese gal, i can\u2019t remember her name \u2013 kondo", "kondo", "which is you pick up something and does that object give you joy", "actually, what she does is different", "she says take everything in your house, and she goes by categories", "put all your clothes in the center, make a big pile, and by default, you\u2019re going to get rid of all of them", "but as you\u2019re going through, if you pick up something that gives you joy, that\u2019s what you keep", "everything else is just gone", "the same thing about all your other possessions", "category by category you decide they\u2019re all by default going to be gone, and you only retrieve those things that give you joy", "that\u2019s a little bit what he\u2019s talking about in that same kind of profound way", "i did try this; i gave it a good college try, and i did find certain aspects of it very helpful, but then the joy part \u2013 i picked up these printouts that were legal documents or tax returns and i\u2019m like, not joyful", "this is not giving me joy", "but it would be very neglectful and irresponsible of me to throw these out", "now what, marie kondo", "the topic of simplicity is one that i try to consistently return to because our lives tend to interrupt you, right", "right", "what books or resources have you found helpful for simplifying your life", "and if that\u2019s not the right question, you can tackle it a different way", "well i think it\u2019s all too much of this decluttering and her books are actually helpful in simplifying things", "i am maybe not as big a fan of simplicity as you are", "i think our lives are inherently more complex than our parents and our grandparents and our children and their grandchildren and future generations will be more complicated", "i think that is generally the drift of this thing we call life and evolution and technology, and they\u2019re going to become more and more complicated", "i think right now some people are very upset over our kind of distracted manner or the way we skip through or surf through the nets and internet and social media", "i actually think that a very sane response to the environment", "where we have to scan because things are much more complicated and we\u2019ll do more scanning in the future", "i think maybe there\u2019s appropriate kinds of complexity; complications maybe we avoid and complexity is okay", "the thing about life is that it surfs a very fine line between rigid order, which is death, and complete chaos", "there is this edge of chaos, they call it", "there is this edge where there\u2019s this particular kind of falling forward or particular kind of chaotic order, or orderly chaos, or something", "i think it\u2019s not rigid simplicity and it\u2019s not just overly chaotic complications", "there is a very fine variety of complexity that is not just healthy, but it is the source and the genius of health, wealth, and everything else that we want", "so i think i might be able to ask a better question, which is, in face of the notifications and social media pings and so on and so forth, a lot of people feel anxious and they feel conflicted and over committed", "maybe you just mask it really well, but i\u2019ve never had that feeling from you", "i\u2019ve never gotten the impression that you feel those things", "why not", "are there particular rules or ways that you \u2013 there is one thing and that is \u2013 and maybe this is kind of a zen thing", "the zen mantra is \u201csit, sit, walk, walk, don\u2019t wobble.\u201d i haven\u2019t heard that before", "yeah", "so it\u2019s this idea that when i\u2019m with a person, that\u2019s total priority", "anything else is multi-tasking; no, no, no, no", "so i have a priority", "the people to people, person to person trumps anything else", "if there is anything else going on, whatever", "i have given my dedication to this", "if i go to a play or a movie, i am at the movie", "i am not anywhere else", "it\u2019s like 100 percent i am going to listen", "if i go to a conference, i am going to go to the conference", "that\u2019s true", "i have never seen you on a device while with or near other people", "right", "now that i think about it", "even at wired", "i had the rules of if i\u2019m with a person to person and the phone rings \u2013 no, never", "if i\u2019m on the phone and a notification rings \u2013 no, i\u2019m on the phone", "so i think this sense of, and you can have a priority if you want, whatever it is", "but it\u2019s sort of like i\u2019m going to give, i\u2019m going to be present, whatever that is, at that time and everything else we\u2019ll deal with it later", "\u201csit, sit, walk, walk, don\u2019t wobble.\u201d right", "what books have you found have given you \u2013 and i always come back to books (it doesn\u2019t have to be books \u2013 sources, something that people listening could look at themselves or listen to), have given you rules like that or maxims or sayings that have proved very useful", "well, i come from religious tradition and i actually think some of the religious texts are very good for that", "i think it\u2019s very hard to read the bible all the way through", "by the way, i recommend that you do that at least once in your life", "no matter who you are, sit down \u2013 well, it will take a long time", "but read through the bible and read a modern version", "it will take you some time", "it is probably the most amazing thing you haven\u2019t read yet", "it\u2019s highly disturbing, highly influential and whatever your opinion about it is, you\u2019re going to be wrong", "whatever you think, whether you think it\u2019s the greatest \u2013 read it through it\u2019s an amazing book", "i say the same thing about the koran", "try to read the sufi stuff", "there is nothing that i enjoy more than at night reading rumi", "yeah", "i mean it\u2019s just something about it", "he\u2019s a sufi mystic from afghanistan who is a transcendent, thought leader maybe like seneca or something", "he has tremendous wisdom", "so i think the wisdom of the ancients, in general, have a lot to offer us and i think reading the zen parables, you know, the sound of one hand clapping, zen mind, beginner mind \u2013 these kinds of things", "for me, that kind of wisdom \u2013 it\u2019s not like you have to slavish or obedient to them", "take what you find useful, move on", "but i found a lot of use in those texts", "so we have in a sense these timeless philosophies and belief structures that can help us make better decisions and so on", "then we have subject matter expertise of different types that can become more or less relevant over time", "we were chatting before we started recording about a question that i get asked all the time", "which is, what industry should i be paying attention to in the next three to five years", "what skills should i learn", "and most of these are business focused \u2013 but what skills should i learn to be able to take advantage of new, non-obvious industries in the next 10 to 15 years", "right", "you mentioned, and i might be getting the wording here off, but sort of tech literacy", "techno literacy", "techno literacy, different types of literacy, can you elaborate on that", "right", "so let me put it, again, into a little bit of context", "i\u2019ll talk a bit more, but let me just preface and say that i do talk a bit about this in my new book called the inevitable", "yeah, i have one of the few copies right here in front of me", "tim has one of the first copies off the press", "it\u2019s talking about the next 20 to 30 years, mostly about digital technology and the trends that i consider non-negotiable, inevitable in the sense that there is not much we can do about it", "there\u2019s a lot we can do about the specifics, but i don\u2019t know about the bigger trends", "they are coming whether we want them to or not", "the inevitable subtitle, \u201cunderstanding the 12 technological forces that will shape our future.\u201d right", "and one of the first chapter talks about this question of skills", "i think that the specifics, like what language should i be learning in school", "or what business skills should i have", "i think what i think are more useful and what i counsel even my own kids about, are there are these mental level skills", "the skills of learning how to learn, the skills of learning how technology, in general, operates, which is what i would call the techno literacy skills", "an example of a techno literacy skill is that besides the initial purchase cost of the technology, whatever you buy you, you now have a maintenance cost", "that maintenance cost is making sure that it\u2019s upgraded or integrated, or just maintaining it in some capacity", "so there are several levels of the cost", "it\u2019s not just how much does it costs to buy, how much does it cost to maintain in your life", "there\u2019s a price to dealing with it when it breaks down, upgrading", "it\u2019s sort of like owning a boat, a little bit", "it\u2019s not the initial cost of the boat, it\u2019s the maintenance that really is the costly part", "and the same thing with anything that we buy", "so if you get something into your house, there is now a relationship with that thing", "it\u2019s like having a pet or an animal or something", "you have to deal with it and its interaction with other things", "that\u2019s just an elementary thing", "there is also a negative cost too, in terms of whatever it is that we have, there is going to be some downside", "journalists are usually pretty good about identifying", "you should pay attention to what people say about the negative aspects of it because they are real", "it\u2019s not that they should discourage you from using the technology, and i\u2019ll argue that it shouldn\u2019t, but we should be aware of them and willing in a certain sense to pay the price", "what would be an example, a clear example to you of a technology with a downside that perhaps is underappreciated or downsides that are underappreciated", "automobiles kill one million humans on earth every year", "now imagine if we were going to introduce automobiles and say here are cars", "it\u2019ll kill one million of us, do you want to drive it", "not the best pitch i\u2019ve heard", "i know, but that\u2019s what i\u2019m saying", "i\u2019m saying there are all these hidden \u2013 but that\u2019s real and this is one of the reasons why i think driverless cars are going to \u2013 even though they will \u2013 here\u2019s the thing", "the first driverless car that kills a person, people will go completely bananas, but we are killing one million of them ourselves", "that\u2019s not registered for some reason", "it\u2019s like, that doesn\u2019t count", "yeah, they\u2019ve lost the reference point", "exactly", "so there is going to be driverless cars will kill some people, but they are not going to kill as many as we kill", "so in evaluating that, in evaluating whether you want to get in \u2013 there are going to be, by the way, ethical issues with driverless cars because we give ourselves a pass when we have an accident", "it\u2019s like, i didn\u2019t have time to react or i wasn\u2019t thinking", "but the driverless car has to be programmed", "and so you have to give it a preference", "if there is an accident, do you give the passenger safety preference over the pedestrian", "right", "or do you give the three elementary school kids \u2013 the trolley problem", "exactly", "the trolley problem", "over the seven people who are 70 years old", "right", "so when you go to buy a car and volvo says, \u201cwe give passengers preference,\u201d is that ethical", "is the programming one of the selling points", "you are 12 percent less likely to be sacrificed in compromising environments", "exactly", "so techno literacy is to like say we need to cognizant of this, if there\u2019s cost, if there\u2019s ethical dimensions to this", "and there are other techno literacy skills, like the fact that you don\u2019t really want to learn a language, a programming language, you want to learn how to learn a language, because you are going to have to relearn it later on and you want to understand that when you buy something, it is immediately obsolete, right", "it\u2019s always, by definition", "so one of the things i recommend is you want to buy things five minutes before you need it not ever before", "there is no sense in hoarding this stuff because it\u2019s just going to change just in time", "just in time", "just in case", "exactly", "so there are things, i think those kinds of skills are going to much more useful", "i think i might have said this before, but when i was at wired and we were doing hiring, first of all i never looked at anybody\u2019s educational background", "i looked at their experience", "the model that i had in my head was you hire for attitude and the skills we\u2019ll train", "we\u2019ll train for skills", "i wasn\u2019t really hiring people for skill set per se, it was more of their attitude, their orientation, their techno literacy, their ability to learn and adapt", "that was far more valuable than the particular skills they had", "now at some level, skills play into it and sure, there is a certain skill requirement, but i think maybe as important is these other levels", "now it makes me think of this, i think it\u2019s a bit from neil gaiman\u2019s commencement speech \u201cmake good art,\u201d but he says at some point he realized that there are three important components if you want to keep a job", "it is get along with people, have people like you, deliver things on time, be good at your job", "he said, the good thing is you don\u2019t really need all three, you just need two out of the three", "if you have two out of the three, they\u2019ll keep you around", "do things on time, have people like you, or be really, really good", "he\u2019s like, you only need two of the three", "do things on time is really great, but in terms of other people who are self-starters, like if you don\u2019t have a job if you\u2019re trying to do something, the equivalent of that is to just do lots of it over and over and over again", "i can\u2019t emphasize how important that doing it a lot is, because the only way to get through, the only way to find out what you\u2019re really good at or if no one else can do, is basically a lifelong project", "you have to throw a lot against the wall and see what sticks", "you have to do a lot and lot", "the more failures you have, the more successes", "it\u2019s a really, very clear ratio that\u2019s linked", "you just have to do a lot", "that\u2019s the only way you can find out what you\u2019re good at", "because how many college kids, young people coming out, they say \u201ci don\u2019t have a passion", "i don\u2019t know what i\u2019m good at.\u201d the only way that i know to find out your passion is to actually work to it by trying lots of stuff and becoming expert at something", "right", "well, in a way this might sound clich\u00e9d, but instead of discovering yourself, you\u2019re creating yourself", "these kids (kids \u2013 i sound like such an old man) but these young people who graduate from college and then they want to sit down and journal for ten minutes or take multiple choice tests to figure out their myers briggs and have their kind of assignment for passion", "i\u2019m like, that\u2019s not how this works", "you\u2019re not a block of ice that is being chipped away to reveal the sculpture underneath", "you\u2019re actually just a small piece of clay and all the other bits and pieces need to be added", "there is a kernel of it that is you, but you need to construct that and the way you do that is by doing these experiments and trying x, y, and z and everything else in between", "i still feel like i\u2019m doing that", "i\u2019m still doing that", "i\u2019m almost 65; i\u2019m still doing that", "and the people that i respect the most in my circle are still doing that", "they are still asking themselves at 70 years old, what i am going to do when i grow up", "i mean, it\u2019s like who am i", "what am i here for", "should i be doing this", "and that\u2019s actually why i respect them so much because they are still constructing their life rather than discovering it or finding it", "they are constructing it and i think that\u2019s a really wonderful metaphor", "you said a while back when we were just putzing around in my living room looking at the living wall and what not; you said there are no vr experts", "right", "so i wrote this big cover story in wired about vr, and a couple years ago i wrote about ai and, by the way, these are the kinds of things that are in my book, the inevitable, where i\u2019m looking at these things which are coming", "ai is coming in a big way, vr is coming", "the particulars of how it arrives, who owns it, how it\u2019s structured \u2013 those are not inevitable, those are not predictable", "they make a lot of difference to us", "so we have a lot of choice in this thing", "but one of the things i want to emphasize is that right now, basically, there are no vr experts", "it\u2019s completely open", "really, we (collectively) humans have no idea how vr is going to work, what content will really work best in vr, what the necessary amount of equipment will be, what that consumer breakthrough version will be", "even though there is vr today, the vr today is good enough improve", "so it hasn\u2019t been good enough to improve but now today with the oculus and the vive and this other stuff, it\u2019s now good enough to improve for reasons i can talk about", "it will improve very fast, but there are no experts", "so that means that a person out there listening to this, could easily become a vr expert, okay", "there are really no ai experts", "there are a lot of people working on ai, but compared to what we\u2019ll know in 20 years from now, we don\u2019t know anything", "so it\u2019s actually not that difficult to become an ai expert", "so let\u2019s say someone listening said, you know what", "i\u2019ve read about vr; this is really exciting", "i\u2019m tired of my comparative literature major", "i\u2019d like to switch gears and really immerse myself", "what would you suggest they do", "if they seemed earnest, intelligent, they were committed, they were like i want to become a vr expert or ai, you can take your pick", "yeah", "there was a guy, kent bye, who runs the voices of vr podcast", "two years ago, he quit his job and has interviewed 400, he\u2019s done 400 interviews of almost every person working in vr", "that\u2019s his job now is he just does interviews of the voices of people working in vr", "he\u2019s doing the journalistic side", "i would say it\u2019s very easy, which is you purchase some gear and you start making vr; you actually do it", "you buy or you get a pair of google vr, cardboard, which you can get for free", "use your phone and start making vr", "you\u2019ll learn more about it than reading about it, than working, whatever it is", "try to make a vr experience", "make something for five minutes", "the issues are incredible", "there\u2019s lighting issues, there\u2019s continuity issues", "we don\u2019t even have a vocabulary for editing", "like in cinema we have syntax of what a cut is", "right", "how do you do a jump, a dissolve", "a panning shot of x, y, and z", "we don\u2019t have any of that", "none of it really works in vr", "it doesn\u2019t mean the same thing", "so someone has to invent all of those", "the interface, the mouse; there is no mouse for vr", "there are people who have invented it, but there is nothing that has worked like windows and the mouse that engelbart made", "so there is so much that has to be invented and that somebody who just decides that they\u2019re going to work at this every day or every day on weekends or whatever it is, can make a huge advance", "i think you\u2019ll need to do it because you love it", "because this is not economics; we\u2019re talking about investing into mastery", "i was having a chat with marc andreessen recently and he said, what did he say", "i just had a complete mental blank", "i need more tea", "he said a lot of very interesting things", "you will hear about them another time because i just had a complete premature alzheimer\u2019s moment so that\u2019s going to have to be a footnote for later", "what are you most excited about right now", "i\u2019m going to take that in the professional sense", "you can take it in any sense", "no, i really mean that", "well, in the personal sense, i\u2019m still very excited about asia", "asia is the culmination for me of the future", "you asked me before about \u2013 i go to china to hear what the future will be and also because i have a love for the asian traditions that are disappearing very fast and i\u2019m trying to record them", "so i go to asia to photograph these disappearing traditions, ceremonies, and what not", "tim was just joking that i came back from kerala, india, where i was photographing these massive elephant precessions that the temples have, with 40 elephants parading through and all kinds of ceremonies", "i don\u2019t know how long they can continue that", "it\u2019s a very expensive, elaborate spectacle, not just in one place but throughout the rural areas", "it\u2019s like other areas that as they become modern, some of these traditions become hard to hold onto", "i\u2019m not nostalgic about wanting to keep them or protect them, i just want to record them, because i think they will go away", "so that excites me", "i\u2019m working on another book, and that\u2019s personally something i love to do for joy", "that\u2019s the only reason", "just because i love to record and document these things and see them", "but the other thing i\u2019m excited about in the world of the future is ai", "i can\u2019t overestimate or over-enthuse on the disruptive nature that i think ai will be in the broadest sense", "many people use analogies and i have several analogies, but the one that maybe would make sense to most people was the industrial revolution was this huge thing from the world of agriculture, where we used our own physical muscles and the muscles of animals to get things done", "and then we had this thing where we automated that with artificial power, artificial electric power, and steam power, and later gasoline power", "this is artificial animal power, artificial human power that we used to make our lives so much easier and so much different", "everything our whole lives \u2013 in fact this house has been built using this automated power", "imagine if you had to make it by hand; it\u2019s just insane we couldn\u2019t do it", "so all these motors and the harnessing of that power propelled this industrial revolution in the modern world that we have", "150 years ago, farmers would take an item, like a hand pump, and say we\u2019ll make it electric", "so they took things and they electrified them", "what we are doing now, we\u2019re at the very beginning of it, is we\u2019re going to take all the things that we electrified and we\u2019re now going to cognify them", "we\u2019re going to add intelligence to them", "everything \u2013 and not just things that are electric, but even inert things, like a chair, like the door", "people laugh, or they say you\u2019re going to put a computer in a door", "20 years ago or 30 years ago", "yes, go to a hotel today, there is a computer in your door, there is a little card reader", "so we\u2019re just going to keep adding this and it\u2019s going to get smarter and smarter in multiple different ways", "so that intelligence, what i call artificial smartness, is not human intelligence", "it\u2019s like artificial power", "it\u2019s like synthetic learning", "it\u2019s just very specific, narrow, brute force kind of intelligence", "so while we can think of our lives as having \u2013 when you drive a car, it\u2019s what", "240 horse power", "you have 240 horses at your disposal", "then we are going to do the same thing with ai like you\u2019re going to have like 250 minds right here to do whatever it is that you want to think about or solve", "you just hire this", "and so it will be like electricity in the sense that you\u2019re not going to make the ai, you\u2019re going to buy it from the cloud", "it will be like amazon web services", "exactly", "in fact, google is selling their ai", "you can purchase ai from google today", "and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do, yes; $.60 cents per thousand instances", "really", "yes", "google ai can do amazing things, like it can look at a picture and tell you what\u2019s going on in that picture", "and you can actually ask it questions", "you can say what\u2019s that person wearing", "what color is that hat", "what are they doing with it", "and then it will tell you back \u2013 $.60 a thousand", "so what would your response be to those who have fear of the rise of the machines", "skynet and creating the summoning of demons that we can\u2019t control, etc", "how would you respond to that or comment on it", "i would say first of all, it\u2019s possible but very unlikely", "why do you say that", "a lot of reasons", "one is that the general trend is that automation, including this ai, will create more jobs than it destroys", "it will take a lot of jobs away", "i think in 20 years, at least 50 percent of the people driving trucks will no longer drive trucks", "and by the way, truck driving is the most common occupation in the us", "i did not know that", "so 50 percent of those won\u2019t have jobs", "especially long-haul trucks and stuff like that", "so there will be jobs", "i like to think that there are tasks that are going to be taken away", "so automation, including white-collar tasks like mortgage, people working in banks all this kind of stuff, anything", "if you have a job that\u2019s defined by productivity or efficiency, that\u2019s a job that is going to go to ai", "so productivity is for robots, okay", "yeah", "productivity is for robots", "what humans are going to be really good at are asking questions, being creative and experiences", "so almost everything in our world right now is becoming cheaper and cheaper in cost", "the few things that are increasing in cost are all experience based \u2013 tickets to a concert, tickets to hamilton, and tickets to travel, personal coaching, nursing care, and weddings", "those are the things going up in price because they\u2019re not commodifiable, they\u2019re not able to be manufacturable \u2013 they are experienced based", "they\u2019re not efficient", "science is terribly inefficient", "you\u2019re not learning anything unless you\u2019re making mistakes; that\u2019s inefficient by definition", "innovation is inherently inefficient, so we will move to those things, and they don\u2019t all have to be highbrow", "again, nursing care, being a companion for someone, giving them attention, giving them an experience, so there is a big room there", "but i think we\u2019re going to move away from things that are being measured in terms of efficiency because anything that\u2019s concerned with efficiency, whether its white-collar, knowledge work, or physical work, goes to the robots", "what has been the most impressive vr experience or profound that you\u2019ve had", "so this is a good question, because i saw them all and i saw \u201cthe secret of magic leap,\u201d which had a really good visual representation, but it turns out \u2013 magic leap being augmented reality", "they call it mixed reality, because it\u2019s the kind where you have a clear glass that you\u2019re wearing", "like google glass, but you have a full vision and there is synthetic or an artificial object or a being or something in your vision", "so we could be looking around this room and i will have these glasses on and i could see either a virtual screen, or a virtual tea cup, or a virtual book, or a virtual animal and it would look \u2013 it would be really present", "for people who want to just get a sample of this, i\u2019m sure you could just google it, but there is also a really, i thought, a good piece written by chris dixon on \u201cwhat\u2019s coming next in computing,\u201d i think was the title, the headline, and there is a little animated gif of magic leaps", "magic leaps, right", "a demonstration of this little sort of, it looks like a japanimation robot hanging out under someone\u2019s desk", "desk, right", "it\u2019s very vivid and i saw the robot and so there are several things about where it doesn\u2019t work", "where they have to improve is that object is not lit in the same way as the rest of the room, so there is a little mismatch", "to light that thing and render it in real time with the light in the room \u2013 we are way off on that", "so what you have is you have an artificial thing that\u2019s really there", "it\u2019s like having a cartoon thing", "you know it\u2019s not really real but it really is there", "it\u2019s like who framed roger rabbit", "yeah, but that\u2019s very useful", "if you\u2019re designing a prototype and you can actually walk around and you can have a virtual screen", "so they talk about this being the \u201clast screen\u201d because within it, if you wear these goggles you can have virtual screens that are very highly detailed", "i could watch an hd movie in it without any discomfort at all", "so you can have as many screens as you want and you\u2019re interacting with them", "but you just take off the goggles and they\u2019re gone", "which means you can also make them appear anywhere you want", "so this is the future of work and you can actually have teleconferencing, which is another thing were you have a virtual person next to you", "that is amazing and it\u2019s something i would pay, i don\u2019t know, thousands of dollars for right now if i could have that", "so were you, in general then, does that mean more impressed by the augmented reality, or mixed reality than virtual reality", "augmented or mixed reality is the more difficult of the two to do, and if you can do mixed reality, you can do vr just by turning the lights down, making it black", "so technically, vr is a subset of the mixed reality", "understood", "okay", "so the visual accomplishment of magic leap is there but that wasn\u2019t the most amazing experience that i had", "it turns out that the visual is only 50 percent of your sense of experience", "it\u2019s the tactile; it\u2019s the audio and the feeling, and using your hands and your body", "the best experience i had that was really amazing was something called the void, based in utah", "they are making an arcade version on vr, where they provide all the equipment and you go in and you pay for an experience, say for a half an hour", "you pay $30.00 for 30 minutes", "and you go in and they\u2019re going to give you a full vest; you\u2019re suited up and it\u2019s amazing", "it really is because they mix the real and the virtual", "so let me give you an example: there\u2019s something called redirected walking", "the way redirected walking is, is imagine you have your goggles on; you see something inside and you turn 90 degrees, a hard 90-degree turn to the right", "but what you\u2019ll see is only an 80-degree shift", "they are cheating you 10 degrees", "and they can compound that cheat so that you think you\u2019re walking in a straight line for a mile across this amazing city scape", "oh, but they have you going in a slight arc", "but you\u2019re going in a circle", "okay, that\u2019s wild", "you\u2019re going in a circle and you don\u2019t know that", "and they can do redirected touching, where you\u2019re grabbing things and you think you\u2019re grabbing different things, but it\u2019s the same thing", "or even stairs that you think you\u2019re walking up the stairs, but it\u2019s just stairs that are cycling through", "like they\u2019re rotating", "right", "so they are able to give you a 30-minute, where you\u2019re exploring this incredible thing, and it\u2019s just a little tiny room", "wow", "okay", "and here\u2019s the other cool thing they did in this", "so you\u2019re wearing this vest, this haptic vest that\u2019s vibrating and doing all kinds of stuff", "they had you go up this elevator and you\u2019re on the second story and it\u2019s kind of like this indiana jones demo that i saw", "and there is this floor right before you and it\u2019s rocky and it\u2019s not very stable and you need to get across and you\u2019re walking across and you fall down two stories", "and what happens is that you\u2019re on a platform that moves six inches, but you have just fallen two stories, okay", "wow", "that sounds terrifying", "well no, it\u2019s exhilarating", "so does the floor just drop out from under you like cartoon-style", "yeah", "and then you\u2019re floating for a second and then you drop", "yeah, exactly", "oh, my god", "well, the point of all this is \u2013 i hope they have great waivers", "the point of all this \u2013 because in only moves six inches", "the point of all this is that there are all these tricks to what we assign our own believability of what is real, where we are", "just like cinema exploits a trick of our vision", "you think mickey mouse, which is not a real character, is throwing a baseball, and you see that ball as really moving across the screen but there is no movement right", "there is only a series of still images that we can assemble in our brain", "vr is exploiting that similar set of new discoveries so our bodies believe that these things are happening", "our minds know", "well it\u2019s like going from optical illusions to full-body sensory illusions", "exactly", "and this turns out to be very important", "so what i say is and what i discovered from looking at this vr, is that we are moving from an internet of information where you can get any information anywhere in the world", "anybody who lives anywhere can have all the information they want, to an internet of experiences", "these are very powerful experiences", "so it\u2019s not just the experience of horror or falling, but all kinds of other experiences that we\u2019re going to have", "and when you\u2019re there, you come out of these vr and it\u2019s not that you remember seeing something, you remember something happening to you", "it\u2019s a much different presence", "in fact first-person shooter games turn out to be a little too emotionally exhausting when you\u2019re in vr", "they produce ptsd if it gets real ugly", "yeah", "there was this vr documentary of going to a pig slaughter, and you\u2019re in the shoot with the pigs", "oh, god", "people said i could watch that but i can\u2019t \u2013 go through it", "\u2013 go through it", "i can\u2019t be in there", "there was another demo someone had and it was called killing the alien where you have to stab this alien being", "but there\u2019s haptics involved and stuff", "what do you mean by haptic", "haptic is this term for tactile, of sense, touch", "got it", "they call it haptic technology and it means that when you grab something there is a response to it, or you can feel it", "right, there\u2019s a resistance or texture", "there\u2019s a texture and there\u2019s a lot of work into how do you get that sense that you\u2019ve grab something or you can feel something", "how far do you think we are from vr sex", "well, let me tell you", "i had a great one last night", "well, there\u2019s teledildonics", "teledildonics \u2013 where you can remotely control various sex apparatuses", "i saw these guys who have a technology for what\u2019s called volumetric capture, 3-d volumetric capture", "i\u2019m getting all sorts of terrible images in my head", "right", "so volumetric capture is \u2013 they use like seven or more cameras to record a person in all their detail, so that when you see them in vr, they\u2019re moving around and you can see every single hair", "so i have been volumetrically captured before", "live or just a snapshot", "it was a still", "that\u2019s the difference", "this is not a still", "no, understood", "but even the still was eerie because it was exactly me", "it was mapped with \u2013 if you zoomed in you could see these tiny little grids and it was like, whoa, okay", "right", "so the volumetric capture of live movement is amazing because \u2013 and you\u2019re in a 3-d presentation of it", "i felt uncomfortable even getting close to that person", "like you\u2019re in their space", "you react to it; you really feel like they\u2019re there", "if they\u2019re giving it eye contact and a voice, you have a total \u2013 like again, going back to the body, maybe your mind says they are not really there but your body is saying they are there, that\u2019s them", "it turns out that second life is now doing a vr version called sansa", "it\u2019s a thousand times better than the old second life because those avatars are getting their body language from that person", "they are getting the voice and they have the eye contact", "even if their avatar is not exactly them, you can still see them with their voice and their body movements and their micro expressions, they\u2019re really there", "when do you think the haptic technology will be at a point where \u2013 okay we are back to sex", "yeah, oh yeah", "dating in san francisco is a real pain in the ass", "i could skip the pleasantries and just have \u2013 well, the reason i mention the volumetric capture, as i was saying, this is amazing", "i was saying, sex, right", "they were saying \u201cthose are the first people who had come to us", "all the porno", "they were the first; we have got to have that.\u201d i think i\u2019ve heard that pornhub actually has a vr channel now or something", "it wouldn\u2019t surprise me", "it\u2019s the most popular website in the world that no one admits to going to", "right", "they have been way ahead in terms of their use of video grammar, the summaries, and stuff like that", "so i haven\u2019t seen it personally, but i think that to answer your question, i\u2019m sure that right now there are probably one or two places that have probably put this together", "so if you were a betting man, if you had to be; would you say available to those who can afford it in five years", "absolutely, less than five years, absolutely less than five years", "the void is, i think they\u2019re already opened", "it\u2019s here", "to outfit your whole body like this, it\u2019s doable now", "i think this is going to be \u2013 things are going to be mostly regulated by economics and then the law, like where this is going to \u2013 yeah, things are going to get really, really messy", "like is there someone on the other end, or is this a simulation, is this ai", "right", "are there like actors like the diamond age by neal stephenson", "are they people who are outfitted with their own haptic suits who you\u2019re interacting with", "in which case, which types of laws apply", "right and if you\u2019re in different states", "i think this will be a very sticky problem", "nice", "what are people worried about right now that you think they shouldn\u2019t be worried about", "the only reason i ask \u2013 that they shouldn\u2019t be worried about", "i think the idea of the ai taking over and killing us all, cross that one off", "i think they shouldn\u2019t be worried about gmos, cross that one off", "they should not be worried", "they should not be worried about gmos", "we genetically modify all the crops that you\u2019re eating", "we do them in different ways", "we do it through breeding or whatever it is, but they\u2019ve all been modified", "actually, if you want to modify the crops, modifying their genes with crispr is a lot better than trying to modify then with breeding because with breeding you have no control over what happens", "it is a much more elegant process", "so crispr you\u2019re not concerned about", "no", "there are things i am concerned about", "in fact, i just saw a documentary last night which will be released pretty soon it\u2019s called zero days", "the theme of it \u2013 it\u2019s very well done, not sensational \u2013 it looks at the stuxnet virus, which was a computer virus that was invented, developed by the us and israel to demolish the uranium processing centrifuges in iran", "the message is, they were looking at can you really destroy physical things with a computer virus", "the answer is yes, you absolutely can", "we are at the point where you can actually affect the physical infrastructure with computers", "then the question is, what the rules are for that", "and is that an act of war", "like the geneva convention", "right", "and it turns out there are no rules", "and yet, the us and others are developing these technologies and nobody wants to talk about them because they\u2019re all classified and therefore, no one wants to admit to it", "therefore, you can\u2019t even have a conversation about it", "and yet iran retaliated", "they made the largest cyber army in response to the efforts to take them down, which did not work in the end", "so there already is cyber-warfare going on, but it\u2019s not being talked about, it\u2019s not being admitted", "the us government won\u2019t talk about the offensive", "there are all the other countries that are now building capacity", "and what are the rules", "is it okay to disrupt the banking system", "there\u2019s going to be collateral damage", "what\u2019s accepted", "i think that we don\u2019t have any rules for cyber war is something i\u2019m really worried about", "yeah", "i remember at a conference a few years ago, this very well-respected technologist got up and talked about precisely this, cyber warfare and some of the scarier scenarios and the potential tactics that could be used", "for instance, if there were a natural disaster in san francisco and people went to google (assuming there was still internet connectivity) to try to determine how to respond", "if someone could initiate the disaster somehow and then also figure out a way to present certain search results that were misinformation, maybe even more elaborate than is necessary", "like maybe that\u2019s the 007 bad guy, like \u201ci\u2019m going to leave you here with this sophisticated laser set-up while i go have a sandwich", "mr", "bond, i\u2019ll see you in 20 minutes,\u201d and then he gets away", "maybe it\u2019s a lot simpler than that", "maybe it\u2019s taking out electrical grids with different types of viruses or electromagnetic pulse weaponry", "or, for that matter, i\u2019ve been astonished at how vulnerable a lot of this stuff is to just long-range marksmanship, for instance", "it\u2019s like old technology applied to an increasingly fragile, in some capacities, internet of things", "right, exactly", "so when you introduce ai into that, as the us pentagon has just got some funding to have ai do this kind of stuff; to weaponize ai, basically", "i\u2019m also worried about that", "kill decisions, this idea of right now we have legally mandated assassinations in the us", "we have assassinated us citizens, okay", "can you elaborate on that", "with the drones", "got it", "the drone program will take out a declared individual", "we killed what\u2019s his name", "he was an american citizen in yemen, i guess", "and they targeted him and they killed him", "there was no trial; there was nothing", "so we now have assassination", "but these drones usually have people back in nevada steering them", "and they usually have generals and there\u2019s a whole chain of command involved in the kill decision", "but increasingly there is pressure to expand this kind of warfare because you don\u2019t have to have troops on the ground", "the american public seems much more sympathetic to sponsoring warfare this \u2013 and as that increases, there is a need to have autonomous", "so there\u2019s a very long feedback loop to come back and have humans decide on this or that", "if you could have autonomous ai-driven drones that didn\u2019t need that, then they could actually be making these decisions", "that\u2019s scary; that\u2019s very scary", "do you think just because this is also a topic of common debate in silicon valley in the ai circles", "there were some people who say if you look at deepmind or some of these other ai-focused groups in the us, they have ethics committees; they are collaborating with one another to look at safeguards", "the real people you need to be worried about are sort of the fast-moving solo acts in places like china; in places like fill-in-the-blank, who do not have that safety-first mentality", "and people would argue that maybe that\u2019s not the case in the us either in certain places", "but if someone is going to cause a big mess with ai, what are the characteristics of that", "ai is still so early in it that i wouldn\u2019t hazard a guess, but i do acknowledge and i would emphasize that this is a global enterprise, and the chinese are very keen on making ai", "the three ingredients you need for ai these days are these deep neural nets, like deepmind", "and then you need huge farms of gpus, graphical processing units, which have been commoditized but the video game industry", "like in video chips", "it turns out there are parallel processors that are really affordable", "so before, ai was done on super computer parallels that would cost millions and millions of dollars", "then it turns out that these little video chips that you make for video games were parallel processing and they were really cheap", "so now they buy these big farms of these cheap video game processors", "so you need lots of those", "and then you need big data", "big data is sort of the rocket fuel", "so the companies like baidu and alibaba, who have big data, are actually able to do this kind of ai right now", "i think there\u2019s no monopoly on ai right now", "china, europe, even japan, will all get into this business and i would expect, just given history, that there will be a disaster, an ai disaster of some sort", "i mean it\u2019s inevitable, right", "it\u2019s not to say that ai shouldn\u2019t be pursued; it\u2019s just like anything else", "someone will abuse it", "if you\u2019re going to have large-scale water projects, there\u2019s going to be some horrible flood that\u2019ll kill a bunch of people or a fill-in-the-blank disaster", "right", "so we have to be ready for that and not freak out about it, which is what i think one of the tendencies will be", "okay, stop ai, research, no more federal funding ai", "that will also happen, too", "people will respond to that by saying we have to stop ai", "if you had to again, sort of play nostradamus a little bit, what do you think the first few big wins of ai will be", "where people will really step back and go, whoa", "yes", "it\u2019s going to be, well, two things", "i think there will be these huge big wins", "but what\u2019s very curious about this is that whenever these wins happen, as they have in the past, then immediately we don\u2019t call it ai", "ai is only what we can\u2019t do", "what we hope to do is called ai, and once we do it, it\u2019s called machine learning", "so the first big win will be a translation", "we\u2019ll have a little device that we can wear in our ear and it will hear you speaking chinese and it will whisper to me english", "we\u2019ll have that in, i don\u2019t know, five years or so", "but we\u2019re not going to call it ai; no, that\u2019s not ai", "they\u2019re just dumb computers doing this stuff", "it\u2019s no longer ai", "people don\u2019t think of siri as ai", "that\u2019s just machine learning", "it\u2019s just siri", "driving the car \u2013 that\u2019s no longer ai", "of course computers can drive a car; of course they can play chess", "because once it happens, it\u2019s like of course", "that\u2019s obviously not ai", "ai is always what we can\u2019t do", "so there will be these wins like perfect translation", "that will be very common", "and talking to these assistant bots; that\u2019s the other thing", "you\u2019ll have these conversations \u2013 let\u2019s do this, do that, echo", "i was going to say it sounds a lot like early innovation of echo", "right, okay", "is that ai", "do people think of it as ai", "no, that\u2019s not ai, that\u2019s just echo, whatever it is", "so i think that conversation is the interface mostly to ai for a very long time and we will get really good at that", "i think people will ignore it", "it will become invisible to them", "i think most of the ai will be invisible, like we were talking about amazon web services", "it\u2019s going to be behind the scenes, it\u2019s going to be very particular", "i mean right now, your calculator is smarter than you are in arithmetic", "it doesn\u2019t freak you out, right", "right", "it\u2019s great", "google is better than you in recall", "so we have this very specific artificial smartness and that\u2019s where a lot of this is", "most of the ai is not like human intelligence; that is why we are making it", "the whole point is to think different, to make things think differently than us", "the reason why we want these ai to drive cars is because they aren\u2019t driving like humans", "they aren\u2019t worried about whether they left the stove on or having an argument with the garage", "they are just driving better than we can drive", "so we\u2019ll make a lot of the stuff that does things that are not \u2013 i mean, like when google is remembering all the webpages in the world, that\u2019s inhuman", "it\u2019s not anything we can do", "so a lot of this stuff will be \u2013 and once we see the machines doing it, we\u2019ll say well, obviously, we weren\u2019t the only ones who could do that, but now it\u2019s all in retrospect", "right", "do you, and this is a total left turn, but do you journal", "is that a practice that you have or not really", "it\u2019s an occasional practice and something that i do occasionally at night, late at night", "when do you do it", "meaning what triggers it", "what are the occasions that you decide to journal", "i\u2019m trying to figure out; i haven\u2019t been able to determine the trigger, but sometimes i\u2019ll just be seized with this kind of, i need to sit down and just journal stuff and write stuff and doddle", "i haven\u2019t been able to detect a pattern, but i have a book that i use and it\u2019s called late night", "i usually do it late night, very late and just kind of i don\u2019t know", "maybe there is a buffer that gets filled or something", "you have to unload it", "you have to delete the download folder", "right, exactly", "start-up disk almost full", "better get this into my journal", "what change in your life or behavioral modification are you proudest of in the last year or recent memory", "and which habits or behaviors are you trying to change", "good question", "i think i\u2019m working on; i was mark zuckerberg who had this kind like he was going to give a thank you note every day for 30 days or something", "so this idea of consciously really trying to express gratitude in a disciplined way is something i have been working on to try to make it more of a habit", "how do you express gratitude", "is it a phone call", "is it a text message", "generally, it has been an email", "i\u2019m not a phone person", "i don\u2019t like voicemail; i don\u2019t like talking on the phone", "i came into my professional life \u2013 i was basically noticed online in writing short, telegraphic, email-ish stuff", "so for some reason, email is my medium and i\u2019m most comfortable with email", "so gratitude", "well, on that note, i want to thank you for taking time to have yet another jam session", "i always have a blast", "what are you up to right now", "what would you like people to check out", "where can they find you", "so i have this book that will be released june 6th", "it\u2019s called the inevitable", "published by viking", "it\u2019s, i think, a pretty good outline of the technological trends for the next 20 or 30 years at the highest level; things that we can\u2019t ignore and that we really should be embracing", "i think if you are interested in what\u2019s coming, that you will really find it very useful because it\u2019s not really technical", "it\u2019s at a high level", "and if you\u2019re looking to where things will be in 20 years, i think i have a pretty good map of where that\u2019s going", "so where can people grab it", "i\u2019m sure by the time they hear this, they can grab it on amazon", "and where else", "kk.org", "yeah, so kk.org is my homepage and where i hangout", "and there\u2019ll be links if you want other languages or the audible version, the kindle", "i think that it all should be listed there and i may even have a calendar-ish thing going and where i\u2019m going to be", "showing what you\u2019re up and speaking engagements or whatever", "right, and in july i\u2019m going to be doing a bunch of stuff, basically appearing on a gazillion podcasts", "i\u2019ve dedicated that for the month of july", "this is why i like to do mine early", "yes, exactly", "another exclusive tim ferriss show opportunity", "this is an exclusive", "i\u2019m so delighted, tim, that you reached out and made the invitation to be at your glorious home", "i\u2019m thrilled to have you here", "i hope that it was useful to the listeners out there because we did kind of go all over the place", "that\u2019s why they come", "they come for the ocd plus the adhd with a dash of hopefully, definitely intelligence from my guests, and occasionally a glimmer of something approaching semi-intelligence on my part", "but everybody check out kk.org", "it\u2019s full of all sorts of things that i have recommended many times over the years, including \u201c1,000 true fans,\u201d of course and much more than that; the \u201cquantified self,\u201d everything can be found somewhere at the hub that is kk.org", "where on social media if somebody wanted to say hello would be the best place to say hello", "i do look at the twitter stream and i\u2019m kevin2kelly", "i have facebook which i don\u2019t look at as much", "but actually, i do look at google plus", "oh, you do", "i do because i find that the comments and the conversation is very high quality", "even though there\u2019s not that many people, those that are there are very active and i pay attention", "so kevin kelly \u2013 if they just search kevin kelly on google plus", "yeah, i\u2019m kevin kelly on google plus", "perfect, all right", "maybe we\u2019ll put that in the show notes", "so everybody listening, you can find everything we\u2019ve talked about, assuming i can track it down, in the show notes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "you can also find links to our previous conversations", "we had two very fun conversations, where we went a lot into kevin\u2019s bio and asked a lot of my usual rapid fire questions that we\u2019ve already covered previously", "you can find that and much, much more at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "kevin, firstly thank you very much also for taking the time", "i always have so much fun", "and to everyone listening, as always and until next time, thank you so much for making the tim ferriss show a part of your daily podcast experience"]}
