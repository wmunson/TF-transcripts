This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Show,\u201d where it\u2019s my job to deconstruct world-class performers, whether they are from the world of chess, entertainment, sports, military, or, in this case, generalized human guinea pig-ness. And that means my guest is a comrade-in-arms of sorts in this wacky world of self-experimentation, A.J. Jacobs \u2013 one of my favorite people out there. @AJJacobs on Twitter and elsewhere is the author of four New York Times bestsellers and he chronicles all sorts of shenanigans. His books include The Know-It-All, which is about his quest to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica and learn every single thing in the world. And, in case you haven\u2019t picked this up yet, he is a hilarious, hilarious human being. The Year of Living Biblically, about his quest to follow all of the rules of the Bible as literally as possible \u2013 fantastic, fantastic book. Drop Dead Healthy, about his quest to become the healthiest person alive in which, with many ill-advised and, sometimes, well-advised experiments. I was involved as one of said advisors. The Guinea Pig Diaries, a collection of various mishaps but also insightful quests like outsourcing his entire life in radical honesty. It\u2019s All Relative, which is coming out in 2017 \u2013 so that is to be read \u2013 about a quest to connect all humanity in one family tree. He is also the host of the new podcast \u201cTwice Removed\u201d by Gimlet Media \u2013 of course, they are the blockbuster factory. The podcast, that is \u201cTwice Removed,\u201d is about finding connections. A.J. takes a celebrity guest and, at the end of each episode, introduces them to a surprise cousin they didn\u2019t know they had so it could be one of their heroes, an old friend, a teacher, etc., etc. A.J. and I talk about a lot in this episode. We talk about some of his habits and what he\u2019s learned from many of these experiments. We talk about his creative process, his writing process, certain tipping points in his life, how he learned to love marketing as an author who disdained it for a very, very, very long time, and a lot more. We cover a lot of ground and I think you will have a blast. That\u2019s my hope. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed chatting with A.J.. So, without further ado, as I always say, please enjoy my wide-ranging conversation with A.J. Jacobs. A.J., good sir, welcome to the show. A.J. Jacobs: Thank you, Tim. I\u2019m delighted to be here. Tim Ferriss: And I thought we could start, maybe, at the beginning. How did we meet? I remember specifically where I was sitting when we had our first conversation, but how did I reach out to you? Was it through the website? A.J. Jacobs: It was. Great. Yes, it was either an email\u2026 But then we talked on the phone soon after and you said, \u201cI\u2019m a first-time writer. I\u2019m writing a book.\u201d At that point, it was called Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: For Fun and Profit. A.J. Jacobs: And you said you had read an article I had written where I outsourced my life to India \u2013 so hired a team of people in Bangalore to do everything for me like answer my email and argue with my wife. And you said that you were writing a book about a similar topic of trying to find ways to hack work and could you talk to me about it and could you reprint that in your book? And I was like, \u201cWell, this guy, he\u2019s writing a book about drug dealing. I don\u2019t know. Should I trust him?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know, what the hell?\u201d So, it came out and then the best part was, a year later, I had forgotten about it and I got a call from you and you\u2019re like, \u201cMy book\u2019s coming out in case you want to check it out and it\u2019s No. 1 on Amazon.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYou mean No. 1 in 20-Something Career Advice?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cNo, No. 1 on Amazon.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou are a genius. How the hell did you do that \u2013 a first-time writer?\u201d So, now, yeah, you are my mentor in publishing. You called me for advice and now, a year later, I needed to call you for advice. Tim Ferriss: Well, this is my chance to ask for more advice. A.J. Jacobs: A-ha. Tim Ferriss: Because I realized that we talked about your writing at the time \u2013 and we\u2019re going to get into all sorts of experiments but, since we\u2019re talking about writing, a number of people in my fan base asked about your writing process \u2013 and so we\u2019ve talked about your writing, the subject of writing, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever talked about your writing process. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, I\u2019m happy to talk about it. I think we actually did because, when you were researching how to write a book, you barely had come out \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. I asked you a little bit about structure. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But I don\u2019t know\u2026 At the time, I remember I was in Argentina \u2013 I was in Buenos Aires \u2013 I was sitting in a coffee shop drinking a cappuccino which was double espresso. This must have been around late 2005 or early 2006 near this place \u2013 well, it\u2019s a large cemetery near Plaza Francia. I remember exactly where I was sitting when we had the conversation. Could you describe for folks\u2026? I guess there are two questions about the writing process: one is micro on, say, a daily basis, when you are writing a book, what that day looks like? A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: And then there\u2019s how do you decide what to write about? So, \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Which do you want to tackle first? Tim Ferriss: Whichever you would like to tackle first. A.J. Jacobs: Well, let me tackle the micro really quickly which would be one thing I like to do first is a little mental calisthenics before I start writing just to warm up my brain. So, I\u2019ll brainstorm \u2013 maybe it\u2019s about the book a bit, itself, or an article but it could just be random stuff. Like it could be, \u201cOh, I saw a snowman. What can we do with that? Maybe we could do a snow transgender person or a snow Neanderthal.\u201d And 99 percent of the ideas suck, as you can tell, but the idea is just to get your creative juices flowing and \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: And you\u2019re writing those down or you\u2019re just doing them inside your head? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Yes, I\u2019m typing them down and, as I say, none of them\u2026 very few of them ever see the light of day but that\u2019s just to get my fingers typing is another thing. I feel just the movement of my fingers on the keys gets me revved up and gets me so that I\u2019m more comfortable typing. The other thing I like to think about is I know that the first half hour of actual writing my book, that is probably going to suck. And so I just have to accept that and be okay with throwing it out but you\u2019ve got to do that half hour before your brain clicks in. So, that\u2019s what I do. I do need three solid hours. Some people can do it where they can write in spurts of 20 minutes. I am not one of those people. Tim Ferriss: I can\u2019t do it, either. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I remember I got some very good advice a few years ago because I was getting very frustrated by the, in my mind, wasted half hour that you mentioned and someone said, \u201cWell, you have to realize that, if you write ten pages and you only get one really good page at the very end, those nine pages are not a waste of time. You needed those nine pages to get to the tenth page.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Exactly. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d prefer to have a better ratio but I\u2019ll take it. A.J. Jacobs: I know. Yeah, there is some warmup. Yeah. I wish it could be more like high intensity interval training \u2013 you\u2019re in and you\u2019re out \u2013 but it is more like stretching and\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Do you tend to do it first thing in the morning or when do you write? A.J. Jacobs: I do\u2026 Well, I have kids so that makes my life a pain the ass. So, I have had to train myself to write at all hours so sometimes in the morning and sometimes at night. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. And do you drink coffee? A.J. Jacobs: I do drink coffee. I also, I have to say, I enjoy my white wine because \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s mostly mornings? A.J. Jacobs: I am a day drinker. I actually prefer drinking during the day. But, yeah, there are studies that show that you\u2019re slightly more creative after, I think, one glass. After two or three glasses, then it all goes to hell but, one glass, it sort of loosens up the frontal cortex and allows you to make more connections. Tim Ferriss: Or it convinces you that you should be more loosened up and you have the placebo effect benefit. A.J. Jacobs: There you go. Tim Ferriss: And you sent me over a quote \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if this is a quote of yours or if it\u2019s attributed to someone else \u2013 but I really enjoyed this and I think it applies to a lot of what you do, not just your writing. But here\u2019s the quote: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting.\u201d Can you elaborate on that or provide us some more context for that? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. I love that quote and I think it applies to both of us. I think \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: It definitely applies to both of us. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, I think a lot of what your work is\u2026 And, yeah, I wish I could say I made it up. It was the founder of Habitat for Humanity whose name escapes me right now but it was a wonderful quote. And the idea is just \u2013 it\u2019s basic cognitive psychology \u2013 when you act in a certain way, then your brain will catch up. But, in terms of change, I find that much easier. Like I wrote a book about the Bible and living by the Bible and one of the things was you had to be more compassionate. And so I had a friend in the hospital \u2013 I hate hospitals, I hate them \u2013 so I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to visit that guy.\u201d But then I thought, \u201cWhat would a compassionate person do?\u201d and I acted as if I were a compassionate person and I forced myself to go to the hospital to visit him. And then, in my brain, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, you know what? I am kind of compassionate.\u201d You sort of trick your brain. Your brain catches up. And I\u2019ve done that and, especially, with optimism and confidence. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a naturally confident person but I act as if I\u2019m confident and, eventually, become more confident. Tim Ferriss: So, in the realm of confidence, what embodies confidence for you? What are the ways in which you act? A.J. Jacobs: Well, for instance, when I wrote a book about health, it was sort of my attempt at The Four-Hour Body and I was so overwhelmed because it\u2019s such a huge topic and I was trying to be the healthiest person alive aside from Tim Ferriss. And so it\u2019s such an undertaking because there\u2019s so much \u2013 there\u2019s sleep, and there\u2019s sex, and there\u2019s food, and exercise \u2013 so I was all stressed out but then I acted\u2026 [Crosstalk] Every morning, I would wake up full of despair but then I would act as if I was confident. So, I would call my publisher and say, \u201cOkay. When we have the release party, let\u2019s have kale martinis. What do you think of that?\u201d So, I was acting all cocky as if this is going to come out and be a big hit. And, after two or three hours, your brain catches up and I actually felt more confident and I really find it\u2019s so helpful. Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot recently because there\u2019s so much talk of mind over body \u2013 and so this is, I guess, a corollary to this quote \u2013 but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about body over mind. And this is something Tony Robbins talks a lot about \u2013 if you want to change your psychology, changing your physiology first. And it\u2019s a lot easier, also, in the sense that, if you haven\u2019t reasoned yourself into a position of, say, a lack of confidence \u2013 or at least you haven\u2019t done it consciously \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to reason your way out of it so you just have to act as if\u2026 A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I agree. And it\u2019s in every part of my life. Like I did one experiment where I tried to be the best husband ever and I forced myself to buy a present for my wife every day \u2013 just a little trinket even if I was totally pissed at her and wanted nothing to do with her. But just that act of giving it to her, it was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m giving her a present. I must love her,\u201d and it really changed my view. So, I am a big fan. And we\u2019re not the only ones: I read about Teddy Roosevelt who, for a while, he was trying to be a cowboy \u2013 he was actually in, I think it was, Montana \u2013 and someone asked him, \u201cAren\u2019t you terrified?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cOf course I\u2019m terrified when the bull is coming at me but I just act as if I\u2019m courageous and I become a little more courageous.\u201d Tim Ferriss: So, it sounds like \u2013 and I read this comparison on, I think, 99U \u2013 one piece may be method acting \u2013 although I know nothing about it, I\u2019m just using the label \u2013 and then there\u2019s the second component which is something that I like this phrase \u2013 and it\u2019s capital \u201cD,\u201d capital \u201cO\u201d \u2013 Delusional Optimism. Can you elaborate on that? Because it seems like they go together. A.J. Jacobs: Yes, I am a fan of Delusional Optimism which is very similar to what we\u2019ve been talking about. I think nothing would get done without Delusional Optimism. One example is I interviewed George Clooney, once, for Esquire \u2013 who, by the way, is as charming as you expect George Clooney to be. He gave me an unsolicited shoulder rub, shoulder massage, so that was\u2026 I\u2019ll always have that. But, anyways, so I asked him about what are his secrets to success and he said one philosophy he has is that he used to be a baseball player in high school and, when he got up to the plate, he wouldn\u2019t just say to himself, \u201cAm I going to hit a home run?\u201d He would say, \u201cNot only am I going to hit a homerun, but the only question is am I going to hit it over the left wall or the right wall?\u201d And I loved that, just like\u2026 And, of course, most of the time, he didn\u2019t. Most of the time, he struck out but it raised the percentage of times that he did hit a home run because he had that Delusional Optimism and I loved that. And you have to be careful \u2013 it can lead to terrible things. So, you have to have some \u2013 especially if you\u2019re in an organization \u2013 you want the CEO to be Delusionally Optimistic and then you want someone else to be sort of the bean counter and be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know about this,\u201d \u2013 a balance. But you really do, I think, need that Delusional Optimism to get things done. Tim Ferriss: And, if we\u2019re then\u2026 Rewinding a little bit and going from the micro book writing process\u2026 Actually, before we leave, the daily writing process, I\u2019ve talked to a lot of my friends who are typically journalists out of newspapers and they drive me crazy and they make me very envious because they talk about how writer\u2019s block doesn\u2019t exist and they can kick out 1,500 beautiful words every few hours and they seem to be able to do it \u2013 a lot of my friends who have worked at different papers. Do you experience blocks or extended periods where you\u2019re just stuck on projects? And, if so, what do you do to help get yourself out of those funks? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. I get blocked all the time. I actually wrote an article once on writer\u2019s block and the way that great writers have overcome it. I remember, I think, Ben Franklin wrote in the nude. A lot of writers wrote standing up \u2013 like Nabokov wrote standing up. There\u2019s a German philosopher named Schiller who needed rotten apples to inspire him. So, I tried them \u2013 like Tim Ferriss, I tried them all at the same time: standing up, naked \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: With rotten apples? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: \u2013 with rotten apples. I don\u2019t know if that was successful but I will say one of them is similar to what I said before which is just start writing and, as long you expect that it\u2019s going to suck, it lowers the pressure. So, a lot of times if I\u2019m stuck, I\u2019ll just start writing about the coffee cup, or the pigeons on the windowsill, or how my elbow itches, and just the fact of moving your fingers \u2013 like we talked about, how much your body affects your mind \u2013 moving your fingers gets you going and helps. But, yeah, it\u2019s a problem. People who say they don\u2019t have writer\u2019s block; they drive me crazy, too. Tim Ferriss: And you mentioned \u2013 this is going to jump around because that\u2019s the style of my brain \u2013 but you mentioned \u2013- and this is a question that came up from quite a few listeners to the podcast \u2013 The Year of Living Biblically which was one of my favorite books of yours. I really, really enjoyed it. And I\u2019ve told you this before, but I learned more about\u2026 As someone who developed an allergy to organized religion pretty early on and, therefore, never learned much about it, it was a fantastic Trojan horse for me through the entertainment value and the humor of the book to actually learn a lot about a number of different religious traditions. A.J. Jacobs: Well, bless you, Tim. Tim Ferriss: Well, that \u201cBless you\u201d leads me to the question which is; what are the things that have stuck with you? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, the \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Because there\u2019s one that stuck with me which is \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Really? [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Well, you talked about wearing white. A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so maybe you could explain what that means but it\u2019s actually something that I\u2019ve ended up doing on a fairly regular basis since I read the book. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: I love that. Me, too. Although you\u2019re wearing dark blue now. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m wearing dark blue right now because all my white stuff is filthy. A.J. Jacobs: Alright. But imagine how much better this interview would be if you were wearing white and I was wearing white. I\u2019m wearing white socks. Yeah, well, this book\u2026 Just to give a very quick background for those who don\u2019t know, I grew up with no religion at all. As I say in the book, I\u2019m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian so not very \u2013 no offense. But I thought one way to learn about religion would be to dive in and actually follow every rule in the Bible, so the famous ones like the Ten Commandments, but also the less famous ones like it says you can\u2019t shave the corners of your beard. I didn\u2019t know where the corners were so I just let the whole thing grow and I had this huge topiary and I got stopped at airport security so it was a crazy year. But one of the \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: The robes probably didn\u2019t help at airport security. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, the robes, and the sandals, and the walking stick. Yeah. As you say, getting into it physically really makes a difference. And one of the rules in the Bible \u2013 and I think it\u2019s Ecclesiastes \u2013 says that your garments should always be white. So, I took that literally and I only wore white pants, white shirts, and white robes and it was weird how it affected my mind, as you know. It made me feel lighter and more energetic. I felt like there\u2019s just something about wearing white like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to P. Diddy\u2019s Hamptons party or I\u2019m going to play Wimbledon.\u201d It\u2019s got positive associations. And here, in New York, people wear dark clothes all the time and I think \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Very noir. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. It affects your mind. Tim Ferriss: So, has that continued to be a piece or what has continued to play a part in your life from that book and from that experience? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. I do like the brighter clothes more than I used to. I would say, a lot of it, I gave up. I did shave the beard because, my wife, she wouldn\u2019t touch me with that thing even though I kept it very clean \u2013 I moisturized, conditioned, and shampooed it. But, in terms of stuff that I have actually kept, I would say one thing that really has stuck with me is that the Bible talks about that you should be grateful all the time. It says that you should be thankful and say prayers of thanksgiving. So, when I was doing the book, I took that literally so I would be thankful for everything. So, I would press the elevator button, I\u2019d get in the elevator, and I\u2019d be thankful it didn\u2019t plummet the basement. I\u2019d press the elevator button and I\u2019d be thankful the doors opened and I got to my floor. So, it\u2019s like hundreds of little, tiny things a day and it was a weird way to live \u2013 very time consuming \u2013 but also, there was something wonderful about it because it made you realize, very concretely, there are hundreds of things that go right every day that you totally take for granted and I, at least, used to focus on the three or four that went wrong and just stew on them. So, I\u2019ve tried to keep that radical shift in perspective of being thankful for all the tiny little things that go right and it has made me happier. It\u2019s definitely had an impact. Tim Ferriss: So, I want you to, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, describe for people one of my favorite stories in the book \u2013 stoning adulterers. A.J. Jacobs: Well, yes, I was doing a lot with the Old Testament \u2013 the Hebrew Scriptures \u2013 and it says over and over again you have to stone adulterers. So, I thought, \u201cAlright, let me try to check this off the list,\u201d so, one day, I was in Central Park and I was wearing my whole\u2026 I had my robe \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: The whole getup. A.J. Jacobs: I had the getup, the sandals, and a man came up to me and he said, \u201cWhy are you dressed like that?\u201d and I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m trying to follow all the rules of the Bible from the Ten Commandments to stoning adulterers.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m an adulterer. Are you going to stone me?\u201d and I said, \u201cWell, that would be fantastic. Thank you for the offer.\u201d So, I took a handful of stones out of my robe pocket \u2013 because I had been carrying them around for weeks hoping\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Because there were no specifications in terms of the size of the stones? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Yes. Exactly. That was the key. I showed it to him and I\u2019m like, \u201cThey\u2019re small stones. I can check it off the list even if they\u2019re small stones.\u201d And he was a very aggressive adulterer. He grabbed the stones out of my hand and then threw them at my face. So, I thought, \u201cAn eye for an eye. I can chuck one back at him.\u201d So, that\u2019s how I checked it off the list. And, yeah, I didn\u2019t continue that. There were quite a few I did not continue including, if you follow Leviticus really strictly, you can\u2019t touch a woman when she\u2019s menstruating because she\u2019s impure but, if you take it really literally, a woman, if she\u2019s menstruating, if she sits on something \u2013 a chair \u2013 that chair becomes impure. And my wife found that offensive so she sat in every chair in our apartment and I had to stand for most of the year which, as you know, is probably good for you. Tim Ferriss: Probably good for your health. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Well, you had a travel stool, right? You had one of those \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 for a sporting event? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Those were great. Yeah. They\u2019re usually used by people who are either 83 or 600 pounds but I found it very useful. Tim Ferriss: So, a number of folks \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to get too deep into the audience questions right now \u2013 but we had quite a few questions about your wife and how you managed your relationship with your wife given all of these odd experiments. And did you, in some indirect or subconscious way, select someone who\u2019d have a high tolerance for all this? A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s a great question. Tim Ferriss: Or how do you repair damage when damage is done? A.J. Jacobs: It is interesting. First of all, she has veto power so there are\u2026 I\u2019m sure you get this all the time, readers suggesting ideas. One suggested, \u201cBecome the greatest lover in the world and do all the positions in the Kama Sutra,\u201d which you kind of did in The Four-Hour Body but I\u2019ve been married for 12 years so that was not going to happen. I did pitch it to her and she\u2019s like, \u201cNo. Not this and I have to say I was a little relieved because I don\u2019t think I can bend my back like that anymore. So, she has veto power and that\u2019s Rule No. 1. And, 2.) I think she gets a lot of reader feedback about how she\u2019s so patient. That helps so please keep sending those in. Tim Ferriss: Positive reinforcement. A.J. Jacobs: I will say, probably, the worst one for our marriage was\u2026 You know the life-logging movement, where you keep track \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Record everything? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, record everything. It\u2019s like the self-tracking \u2013 quantified self taken to the extreme. So, I had a little tiny camera, smaller than a GoPro, on my ear and I recorded every moment of my life for about three months and it was fascinating. And I think it\u2019s a glimpse of the future. I think we are all going toward that for better or worse. But one of the things was I was like, \u201c70 percent of my arguments with my wife are about where she says \u2018You didn\u2019t tell me that,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, I did. I did tell you that.'\u201d So, now I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know what? Now we can rewind and we can see what we actually said. So, we had a huge argument about something \u2013 whether she had asked me to order Mexican food \u2013 something ridiculously small and trivial but it blew up and I was able\u2026 The next day, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s rewind and watch the argument.\u201d And it was so terrible for our marriage because it was like\u2026 I can\u2019t remember, I think I might have been 60 percent right but the net was that I was 0 percent right because she was so upset and you don\u2019t want to show someone yelling or angry. It just is not\u2026 So, I don\u2019t recommend that as a way to navigate a marriage. In fact, there was a Black Mirror\u2026 Do you ever watch Black Mirror? Tim Ferriss: I was going to say. There\u2019s a great episode \u2013 I think it was in the first or second season, the UK edition of the\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0\u2013 fantastic episode. A.J. Jacobs: It was the same exact premise. Tim Ferriss: Very similar premise but you record through your eye, effectively. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. It was great. I love that show and that was\u2026 And, in the episode, things go horribly awry with his marriage. Tim Ferriss: Which I think is probably also likely to happen \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 if that becomes a ubiquitous technology. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What did you learn from that experience, aside from not to replay the Mexican takeout debate for\u2026? A.J. Jacobs: I think, well, one thing I learned is to\u2026 I have hundreds of hours of material so I\u2019ll never be able to watch it because it\u2019s just an infinite loop but I think one is to enjoy the small moments \u2013 if you do watch it, you just realize that 90 percent of your day is\u2026 When you\u2019re getting my kids ready for school, if you are annoyed during that half hour because it\u2019s a pain in the ass, that\u2019s a half hour of your life wasted. You have to realize, \u201cThis is it. This is what most of life is,\u201d so try to enjoy that as well as your playing laser tag or whatever because that\u2019s very rare. Tim Ferriss: Or serving kale martinis at your launch party? A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. That never happened. So, that was one. Also, the implications for the future are fascinating. How\u2019s it going to affect crime? How will anyone mug someone when it\u2019s all being uploaded immediately to the cloud? So, it will, I think, help crime but it\u2019ll be terrible for marriages. And I feel for future adulterers and my heart goes out to them because I can\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re going to get away with sneaking around when everything is fully recorded. Tim Ferriss: Well, on the flip side, it\u2019ll clarify a lot of crimes that are not committed, where people are wrongly accused. A.J. Jacobs: Well, that\u2019s true. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So, you have the flip side, also. A.J. Jacobs: Well, that\u2019s true. Yeah. And I think, also, it might make us more tolerant of people\u2019s mistakes because we all do something\u2026 The YouTube video of people melting down and acting like idiots \u2013 everyone will have one of those. No one\u2019s perfect so we\u2019re all going to have our flaws right out there on display so we have to accept those in ourselves and be a little more tolerant of others. So, it\u2019s going to be a weird future, I really believe \u2013 fascinating, but weird. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. The question for me is, in all these cases, who are going to be the dominant owners of this information and controllers of the bits and bytes that represent all of these videos. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. I know. Tim Ferriss: But I want to come back to tolerance \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure this is a perfect segway but I\u2019m going to force it \u2013 radical honesty. So, you wrote a piece\u2026 I believe it was titled, \u201cI Think You\u2019re Fat.\u201d Am I right? A.J. Jacobs: Yes. That is completely true. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s about radical honesty. Could you describe for people\u2026? And then I want to come back and I\u2019m going to ask you about your thoughts on marriage and parenting but this ties in, I think, on some levels. So, radical honestly, could you describe \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Absolutely. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 the origins of this experiment, and what you did, and where you ended up which I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really talked about? A.J. Jacobs: No. Well, and to be radically honest, thank you. You tweeted about it a few weeks ago and, as per usual, your endorsement gets me more readers in one tweet than I get from months of trying to do publicity. Tim Ferriss: I loved the piece so it was my pleasure. A.J. Jacobs: Well, thank you. Yeah, this piece came about because I read about this guy in Virginia, a psychologist named Brad Blanton \u2013 a fantastic character, one of the greatest interviews of my life \u2013 and he believes that you should never lie, but he goes further. He says that whatever\u2019s on your brain should come out of your mouth \u2013 no filter \u2013 like Jim Carrey in Liar, Liar. So, it is insane. And I was like, \u201cWell, let me try this and see what happens. Maybe he\u2019s right. Maybe it will make my life better despite the challenges.\u201d So, I did it and, oh my god, it was the worst month of my life in many ways. In some ways, it was wonderful, liberating, and terrific. In other ways, it was just dreadful. And, to give you one of the dreadful ones, we would go to a restaurant and we would see friends of my wife that she hadn\u2019t seen since college and they said, \u201cOh, we should all get together and have a playdate with our kids,\u201d and I had to say what was on my brain which was, \u201cYou guys seem nice but I have no interest in ever seeing you again because I don\u2019t have time to see my own friends.\u201d And they would just look at me aghast and my wife, of course, was furious. And the one thing is we never did see them again so, in that way, it was effective. Tim Ferriss: It worked out. A.J. Jacobs: But I felt terrible and I still feel it was totally a terrible thing to say. So, there was that. It did affect me in that I still\u2026 I\u2019m not radically honest like\u2026 Because he\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s like, if you see a beautiful woman on the street, you say, \u201cHello. I\u2019m very attracted to you. I would like to sleep with you,\u201d which I got, weirdly, a lot of people \u2013 20 something guys saying they were using that as a\u2026 Tim Ferriss: As their masterful pickup line? A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. And they said the rejection rate was 95 percent but, if you\u2019re okay with that, then 5 percent of the women were like, \u201cHmm, interesting.\u201d Tim Ferriss: \u201cInteresting proposition. I like the confidence/Asperger\u2019s.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. But what I have kept from that is I try to do what I call \u201cradical sustainable honesty\u201d or \u201cpositive radical honesty\u201d because I don\u2019t need to tell people, \u201cI\u2019m staring at your mole,\u201d because that just doesn\u2019t help the world, I think. But, for instance, one of the things I did is, when I was doing that, I would be thinking, \u201cYou know what? I really like that boss of mine when I was 22 at the small newspaper. He had a very nice influence on me. Let me call him up and thank him.\u201d So, I would call him out of the blue and it was very awkward because men are not supposed to express emotions like that but I would tell him how much he meant to me. And it made me feel so much better and I hope \u2013 I think \u2013 it made him feel better. So, I feel that that\u2019s something I\u2019ve tried to keep. If I have a positive thought, then even if it\u2019s embarrassing or weird, then I will say like, \u201cI love you, man,\u201d or that kind of thing. And I think that has made my life better. Tim Ferriss: So, I was given a similar assignment by an ex-girlfriend a number of years ago because I was having trouble \u2013 and this is no secret to people who\u2019ve read, certainly, a few of the chapters in Tools of Titans or in other places \u2013 that I\u2019ve had my ups and downs in my managing of depressive periods and what not. And she said, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re having trouble making yourself happy, maybe you should identify one person every day you can send a short thank you to or call to give a thank you and, specifically, people from long ago or people you used to be close to or who had a huge influence on you that you are no longer close to.\u201d And so I started doing this and calling teachers I had in high school or childhood friends and it had a hugely uplifting impact on me. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, that\u2019s great. I love that. Did it ever go wrong? Did it ever have some\u2026? Tim Ferriss: No, it never went wrong and, sometimes, it wasn\u2019t even about speaking in person so, if I got a voicemail, I would just leave a heartfelt voicemail. It never went sideways for me. And, in fact, it reinvigorated, I guess, or resurrected a few childhood friendships and now I\u2019m back in close contact with a number of these guys I went to grade school with and used to play with on a daily basis on BMX bikes or whatever the hell\u2026 throwing dirt clods into each other\u2019s eyes in the middle of the forest or whatever we were doing at the time. So, it\u2019s been great. It\u2019s been really, really great. A.J. Jacobs: I love that. Tim Ferriss: How do you\u2026? If you\u2019ve dismissed the option of being able to say to someone, \u201cYou seem very lovely but I don\u2019t ever want to see you again,\u201d \u2013 which, in a sense, is fantastic because you\u2019re able to cut down on all of these social expectations and commitments and I think a lot of people are just drowning in coffee invitations, cocktail invitations, \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s do that,\u201d \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to practice this more moderate honesty, how do you think of handling it in a place like New York City, in particular, where you have endless options? A.J. Jacobs: I don\u2019t know. I need your advice on that. I am terrible at it. I will tell people the truth which is, right now, I am so overwhelmed that I don\u2019t have time for basic hygiene and that they wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with me, anyway, because I smell and I\u2019ve got yellow teeth. And that is the truth so maybe that\u2019s my best answer. But, yeah, it\u2019s a tough one. Tim Ferriss: The best I\u2019ve been able to figure out \u2013 this is actually something I borrowed from\u2026 I\u2019m not going to mention him by name because I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d want this to be public but he\u2019s a very well-known billionaire tech investor in Silicon Valley who\u2019s always been very generous with his time. And we\u2019d met up a number of times and I\u2019d asked him if he\u2019d be open to grabbing dinner. And I wasn\u2019t vague about it because I think, at this point in my life, I\u2019ve learned, \u201cLet\u2019s hang out,\u201d isn\u2019t good enough for someone who has so many demands on their time. This was like, \u201cI\u2019d love to meet up to chat about this, this, and this, but only if you have time,\u201d but we\u2019d had dinner a number of times in the past. And he said, \u201cI would love to but I\u2019m taking a meeting vacation.\u201d And so I started applying this to everything. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s brilliant,\u201d because it\u2019s not personalized \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t do it, Tim Ferriss, because I don\u2019t like you.\u201d It\u2019s, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not doing any meetings.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing any meetings. I\u2019m actually doing no phone calls. I\u2019m just responding to things via email because that\u2019s the only way I can manage my schedule right now,\u201d and it was so generalized that I felt totally fine with it. So, I started applying that to anything I didn\u2019t want to do. \u201cI\u2019m taking a conference call vacation. I\u2019m taking a meeting vacation. I\u2019m taking a fill-in-the-blank vacation.\u201d And I also began putting that in my auto-responders so that I didn\u2019t feel obligated to \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: I think I\u2019ve gotten a couple of those, yeah. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve most certainly gotten them. Everyone gets a lot of those from me. A.J. Jacobs: I love that. Who can be angry when you\u2019re taking a vacation? Everyone needs a vacation. Tim Ferriss: Everyone needs a vacation. A.J. Jacobs: Well, and it is interesting, yeah, another thing that I do is \u2013 and some people don\u2019t approve of this, you may not but \u2013 if I\u2019m totally swamped and someone asks me out to lunch, then I say, \u201cWhat would you think about a Skype lunch where we both order in food, and we have lunch, and we get to talk to each other, we get to see each other, but we don\u2019t have to schlep, and we don\u2019t have to waste time, we don\u2019t have to ask the waiter for the check.\u201d And I\u2019d say 30 percent of people are offended but 70 percent are willing to try and I\u2019ve found it very useful. Tim Ferriss: Skype lunch? A.J. Jacobs: Skype lunch. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve never tried that. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Skype dinner, Skype breakfast, whatever you want. And I did it once with this guy who was tech savvy and he had the background of us in a caf\u00e9 in Paris so it was very nice. Tim Ferriss: So, you had your own Lady and the Tramp\u00a0moment \u2013 virtually. That sounds very pleasant. A.J. Jacobs: I don\u2019t know whether I was Lady or the Tramp. Tim Ferriss: Or both? You could be both. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, there were a couple of bullets we, in preparation for this\u2026 Because I\u2019m very familiar with a lot of your work \u2013 I\u2019ve read, I think, all of your books up to this point and \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Got you. Tim Ferriss: And so you sent a number of bullets I didn\u2019t expect or I wasn\u2019t familiar with so I wanted to talk about a few. And I feel like, some of these, we have maybe touched on briefly, but I wanted to revisit. Being kind to your older self \u2013 can you explain what this means? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. I learned this while doing the health book and the idea was\u2026 I think it was a Yale professor \u2013 I forget his name \u2013 but \u201cEgo-nomics,\u201d I think, is what he called it. And the idea was, when they do experiments and they remind people of that they are going to be around in 20 years, people make more responsible decisions like, financially, they invest more in their 401K and, also, health wise, they act more responsibly. So, I thought this was fascinating so I took it and I took just a selfie and I digitally aged it on one of those apps and so I now look like I have a skin disease but it\u2019s me at 82. And I printed it out and put it over my desk and that older A.J. is always looking down and saying, \u201cTreat me well. Remember; treat me like you would treat a friend. And just don\u2019t eat that fourth oatmeal cookie and get on that treadmill.\u201d So, I find it very inspiring and motivating. Tim Ferriss: And is it something that you\u2019re able to continuously notice or do you tune it out after a while? This is a challenge that I\u2019ve had with certain reminders. So, I have a quote, for instance, from Marcus Aurelius on my refrigerator in San Francisco and it\u2019s about trying to regain the harmony as quickly as possible, etc., etc. It\u2019s one of these very Marcus Aurelius-type quotes and there are a number of them around my house. But I will occasionally schedule a rotating of the quote or even location because, otherwise, it just becomes part of the scenery and I don\u2019t notice it. So, \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: So, I love that and I had the exact same thing. If you leave it in the same place, you\u2019re going to forget about it. What I do is I make it part of my rotating screensaver so that \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Got it. Okay, this makes sense. A.J. Jacobs: \u2013 so that it pops up every couple of days and then, \u201cOh, yeah, I should.\u201d But you\u2019re totally right \u2013 we are so good at tuning things out that have been there. Tim Ferriss: Necessarily, right? Evolutionarily, it\u2019s like, \u201cAlright, if there\u2019s a piece of furniture I don\u2019t need to have some type of acute fight or flight intensity level observation of it.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: \u201cBecause it\u2019s clearly not having a direct impact on my survival.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: And I had that same experience with photos. I had a screensaver that was a photo of my family and I totally tuned it out after three days so I started rotating photos to remind myself, \u201cOh, yeah. We did do a fun thing there and it\u2019s not all tantrums and\u2026\u201d Tim Ferriss: \u201cTantrums and debates over Mexican food?\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: What else have you continued to do from Drop Dead Healthy? A.J. Jacobs: I still do love treadmill desks. I made my own \u2013 I didn\u2019t buy the fancy one \u2013 but I do find it energizing. And I only walk one and a half, two miles per hour when I\u2019m writing or answering emails but I find, if I\u2019m sitting in front of a computer, I\u2019m tempted to just rest my head on the space bar and fall asleep so you can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re on a treadmill. So, I do like that. And I also still like the competition. Some people are not motivated by this, but I am \u2013 getting friends and making sure that I get to 10,000 steps or my friends can mock me that they can see. There\u2019s a leader board and that they can\u2026 Tim Ferriss: What do you use for that right now in terms of sharing that with them? A.J. Jacobs: I have been using\u2026 I hooked up my Fitbit to my Apple Health. It was complicated and it took\u2026 Tim Ferriss: It took a while to figure out? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. So, I\u2019m\u2026 Tim Ferriss: How do you encourage your friends to mock you if you don\u2019t get 10,000? Or are they the type of friends that don\u2019t need much instruction in the mocking department? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, I\u2019m trying to think. I used to\u2026 It\u2019s been a while but this great writer who wrote the Henrietta Lacks book \u2013 do you remember? Tim Ferriss: Oh, right. Sure. A.J. Jacobs: Anyway, she is great and also very\u2026 So, I think you just got to find the people who \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Are most adept at mockery? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Are most adept at mockery. I am motivated by mockery. Some people are not. Tim Ferriss: So, there\u2019s a story that I\u2019ve told quite a bit because I think that it\u2019s very practical in a lot of ways and that there are variations of this but I\u2019d like you to tell, probably, the more accurate version because I feel like I get details of this wrong when I retell it: blackmailing yourself. A.J. Jacobs: Yes. I was so on it. I was \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s talk about the KKK. A.J. Jacobs: Alright. Let\u2019s talk about the KKK, which I do not support, just to get that out there right up front. But I was watching many of your talks and, in a couple of them, you mentioned that \u2013 very flattering, thank you \u2013 this is an idea by that same Yale professor and his idea was that, if you want to quit something or you want to stop doing a terrible behavior, then you can blackmail yourself. Tim Ferriss: Is this the same Yale professor who ended up later, or currently, being involved with stickkk.com. A.J. Jacobs: Yes, actually, that\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: Stickkk.com, where this is built into sort of the mechanics of how the site works. A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: This is where you choose the anti-charity. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: This is the anti-charity, sort of \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: In this case, you took it to the next level. A.J. Jacobs: Well, I was \u2013 excuse me \u2013 doing the health book and I was eating all of these dried mangos because they sort of have the veneer of health because they\u2019re fruit but, really, they\u2019re just sugar \u2013 they\u2019re just so much sugar. So, I knew I had to quit so I arranged it\u2026 I said to my wife, \u201cIf I eat another dried mango, then I am instructing you now \u2013 you have to do this \u2013 you have to send a $100.00 check to the KKK.\u201d And it was so effective it was crazy because just the thought of that check going out made me physically ill and I was able to quit cold turkey. And he talks about people smoking who use this strategy and\u2026 Yeah, have you ever tried it? Tim Ferriss: I have tried the anti-charity. And it\u2019s incredible \u2013 I\u2019ve also done this with betting because I think that, for instance, if you have a betting pool of five people who have a certain goal \u2013 let\u2019s just say that\u2019s body recomposition. So, they\u2019re each getting \u2013 this is actually a real example from a friend of mine who recently lost 40 or 50 pounds \u2013 they\u2019re each getting DEXA scans \u2013 so these scans that will indicate bodyfat percentage, and muscle mass \u2013 and so on every, let\u2019s just call it every two weeks or something like that which is, actually, surprisingly inexpensive. It\u2019s $30.00, $40.00. And whoever has the most successful recomposition of their body by the end would get the pot and each person, I think, was putting in $100.00 and so it was a $500.00 total but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the $500.00 that gets people to lose the weight or, in this case, lose fat. I think that it is two things: the social mockery, and grab-assing, and ball-busting \u2013 in this case, it\u2019s five guys \u2013 and it is the losing of $100.00 \u2013 it\u2019s the loss aversion, I think, more than the prospect of gaining. A.J. Jacobs: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: So, this is one of the many issues that I suppose I take with the \u201c43rd Place gets a gold star,\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s a winner,\u201d \u201cWe should only focus on positive reinforcement,\u201d sort of fetishizing of the patting on the head, in the US at least, where I think the stick instead of the carrot \u2013 and the shame and the humiliation \u2013 and all of these things that are thought of as negative are actually really, really useful tools if you recognize how ingrained they are as incentives in human beings. Just \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. I find it very useful. You\u2019ve got to be careful not to crush someone\u2019s ego so they curl up in a fetal position. Tim Ferriss: Right. A.J. Jacobs: So, it\u2019s a fine line but good natured sticks, I think \u2013 like soft maybe Nerf sticks, I think \u2013 are incredibly helpful. Tim Ferriss: So, this is one that I may have read about but it didn\u2019t ring a bell \u2013 a trip to Jerry Falwell\u2019s church. A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yes. Well, this is when I was writing The Bible and I sent you this in the context of just the joy of being a mentor. And I can say this because this guy \u2013 my mentee, my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2013 has far surpassed me in success. His name is Kevin Roose and he was a writer for The New York Times and The New York Magazine. Now he\u2019s at Fusion and he\u2019s written a couple of great books. But I met him because I was writing my book on the Bible and he was a freshman at my alma mater, Brown University, and he wrote me a very funny letter saying he wanted to be a writer. So, immediately, that\u2019s a good lesson: just the chutzpah. I call it \u201cstrategic chutzpah\u201d \u2013 just writing out of the blue. Instead of going through alumni relations, he just wrote me out of the blue, \u201cI want to be a writer. I\u2019ll work for you for free while I learn about it. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t remember this part. A.J. Jacobs: So, that, I was already impressed. And, at the time, I was trying to follow all the rules of the Bible and the Bible actually, in the Old Testament, slavery is fine. So, I was really struggling with, \u201cHow do I deal with that in my life?\u201d because, obviously, slavery is not so fine and not so legal, thank god. So, I said, \u201cThe closest thing to slavery in my life is an internship so, if you can come and be my intern and let me call you my Biblical slave, then let\u2019s do it.\u201d So, he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d And he was great and so proactive and then, as a thank you, I took him on one of the trips I made for that book where I was going around and trying to see how different people interpreted the Bible literally. And I took him to Jerry Falwell\u2019s church and he was fascinated. He was like, \u201cThis is amazing. This is like an alternate universe. I live in a bubble. I want to\u2026 What if I transferred from Brown, the most liberal college in the United States, to Liberty College which is one of the most conservative?\u201d where you can\u2019t watch an \u2018R\u2019 rated movie. You\u2019d get in trouble for it. Holding hands with someone of the opposite sex is like\u2026 that\u2019s \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Forboden. A.J. Jacobs: Forboden. So, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting idea. Yeah.\u201d And I encouraged him to write a proposal, and I helped him a bit, and hooked him up with an agent, and he did it. And he went and got the book contract, wrote a great book \u2013 which is great not just because it\u2019s interesting but because it\u2019s very nuanced \u2013 and he shows that these are people and there are benefits to this way of life and so he didn\u2019t villainize them. And, anyway, I thought that that was fantastic. So, just this idea of being a mentor gives so much pleasure, I think. In one way, it\u2019s a waste of time but, in another way, it\u2019s just\u2026 And it\u2019s also, from a very practical point of view, it\u2019s paid off. Now he\u2019s so much smarter than me and more connected with the internet that he can help me. Tim Ferriss: What, if we look at your toolkit and set of rules\u2026? You have done a lot of experiments for many, many different things. If you were trying to give someone who is, say, about to get married recommendations for marriage and parenting? If you had to be, not somber, but as serious as possible, what would the real advice be? A.J. Jacobs: Well, a couple of things come to mind. One is the clich\u00e9, \u201cDon\u2019t go to bed angry\u201d? I fully disagree with that. I go to bed angry all the time and I find it so helpful because my wife gets cranky at night. If I tried to argue it out with her, she would be furious and neither of us would get sleep and it would be a disaster. You go to sleep, you wake up the morning, and you have a fresh perspective and you can talk about it rationally. And I do that with my kids, too. We start to get in an argument and I say, \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s cool down and let\u2019s think about this. I\u2019m not forgetting about this argument but let\u2019s reconvene in a few hours.\u201d So, actually, I do like that \u2013 so, do go to bed angry is my first suggestion. Another one is from my wife\u2019s stepdad who died recently, but, when we were getting married \u2013 I thought it was very good advice \u2013 he said, \u201cYou\u2019re both going to think that you\u2019re doing 70 percent of the work in the marriage and you\u2019re both wrong. So, just be aware of how much the other person is doing and you\u2019re taking for granted.\u201d And, for one of my experiments \u2013 the one I said where I tried to be the best husband \u2013 one of the things we did was we wrote a list of everything she does in our lives around the house and everything I do. I honestly thought it was going to be about 50/50 and it was 80 her and 20 me so it was a very humbling experience. It was, in one sense, terrible because now she realizes, too, how little I did so it\u2019s made my life worse in one sense but it also was very revelatory and I got to see\u2026 Like the little liquid soap thing, I just figured they refilled themselves \u2013 it was like a self-cleaning oven or something \u2013 but I was like, \u201cOh, yeah. Someone has to do that.\u201d So, be aware of how much the other person is doing, even if you don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s whatever bias it is \u2013 you\u2019re not seeing it so you\u2019re not aware of it. Can I just pop that back at you and ask you what you would suggest to someone going into a relationship? Tim Ferriss: I think this is probably above my paygrade being that I\u2019ve not yet decided how I feel about marriage or gained much clarity related to marriage. But I think I would give the advice that Amanda Palmer, the musician, received from a mentor of hers: \u201cFor any type of conflict resolution, say less.\u201d I think that would be the starting point \u2013 \u201cJust say less.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: I like that. Tim Ferriss: Because my inclination \u2013 and I think that much of my family is this way, certainly my brother is this way \u2013 the desire to be right sometimes overrides the pragmatic road to being effective. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: My brother and I can both get righteously indignant and that does not help with conflict resolution, it turns out. So, I would say, \u201cSay less.\u201d I\u2019ve become better that that. A.J. Jacobs: I love that. There are a couple of things that come to mind, phrases. Like I\u2019ve heard, \u201cYou can be right or you can be married but not both,\u201d which I think is a good one. And then I asked some 80-year-old guy who had been married for 50 years what his secret is and he said, \u201cTooth marks on the tongue \u2013 that\u2019s the secret to a happy marriage. Just bite your tongue. Bite it, bite it, bite it.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s funny. There\u2019s some funny bits of advice that I\u2019ve heard thrown around. I\u2019m not saying this is the advice I would give but I also talked to a friend whose soon to be, who was it, it was not his direct father-in-law but he was about to get married. Literally, the day of the wedding and I think it was the grandfather from the old country \u2013 from Poland or something \u2013 grabbed him and he\u2019s like, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a walk.\u201d He took him for a walk and he said, \u201cThis is all you need to know.\u201d He goes, \u201cOnly professionals, only on the road.\u201d And so I\u2019ll let people figure that out for themselves. But, yeah, some crazy relationship advice out there. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Very crazy. Tim Ferriss: Other advice I would give would be know what you need to work on and, ideally, find someone who\u2019s really good at what you need to work on because I do think, at least for me, there\u2019s a complementary polarity that needs to exist for a relationship to have any longevity. And it\u2019s a complementary set of skills but those could overlap very much with attributes \u2013 just god-given or nature-given predispositions. And then something that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever written about but I\u2019ve noticed for a lot of relationships \u2013 and this goes for hetero-normative, or homosexual, it goes for anything sexual as far as I can tell, at least in many cases \u2013 that, if you were to imagine a sliding scale and you have 100 percent \u2013 and this is going to get people up in a tizzy no matter how I phrase it so I\u2019m going to try to state it simply \u2013 100 percent what we would consider feminine attributes on one end of the scale and then 100 percent masculine attributes at the other end of the scale, and then, in the middle, you have perfect androgyny \u2013 just a complete perfect androgyny in all respects \u2013 A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 physical, mental, emotional, and otherwise \u2013 that, wherever you are on the slider, you will be most attracted to and have the most longevity \u2013 well, actually, I should not say longevity \u2013 you\u2019ll be most attracted to, and perhaps most compatible with, someone who is the opposite. So, if you are, say, 70 percent male attributes or masculine attributes, 30 percent feminine attributes, then you will be most attracted to someone who\u2019s 70 percent feminine attributes, 30 percent masculine attributes. And that that sort of equal polarity from the center \u2013 50/50 perfect androgyny \u2013 seems to work pretty well and that, when you find someone who generally \u2013 and this is just very abstract speculation on my part but it seems to be the case \u2013 when you see people who, say, overlap too much on one side of that spectrum, it very rarely works from what I\u2019ve observe \u2013 very, very rarely. So, that\u2019s not so much advice but maybe a conceptual framework for thinking about\u2026 A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. I was trying to apply it to my own marriage to see if I lined up and I think, actually, 70/30 is about where I am. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. A.J. Jacobs: Maybe 65/35 \u2013 I don\u2019t know, different people would say lower. Tim Ferriss: And so those are some of my passing thoughts but working on it. Yeah, this is something I\u2019m working on a lot. I\u2019m hoping to have a number of people on the podcast to discuss these types of questions \u2013 Esther Perel would be one and there are a handful of others. A.J. Jacobs: Have you had Dan Savage on the show? [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t. He would be another mind to pick on this. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And he\u2019s been recommended by quite a few listeners of mine as well. So, I was chatting with a friend of mine \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve spent any time with Neil Strauss before? A.J. Jacobs: I have. I love that guy. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Alright. So, Neil, eight time New York Times Best Selling Author, he\u2019s one of those guys who never gets writer\u2019s block who makes me crazy but he wrote a piece recently \u2013 I think it was for Rolling Stone \u2013 and it\u2019s something like \u201cThe Age of Fear.\u201d But the point \u2013 I might be getting the headline wrong but \u2013 the basic premise was we\u2019ve never lived in safer times and yet everyone is more fearful than they\u2019ve ever been. So, for a while, you wrote a column for, I guess it was, Mental Floss. A.J. Jacobs: Yes. Can I just say one thing about Neil Strauss that I love? Tim Ferriss: Yes. A.J. Jacobs: It\u2019s that he is so generous with his ideas and this is something I\u2019ve come around to. He gave me two or three book ideas \u2013 I never pursued them, but they\u2019re good book ideas. Like he had one where he said, \u201cYou should just\u2026\u201d \u2013 you know what, it\u2019s kind of similar to your podcast \u2013 \u201cYou should find the best \u2013 the Michael Jordan of everything \u2013 and learn their secrets, and then write a book.\u201d It\u2019s kind of Tools for Titans. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s kind of exactly what I did, yeah. A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s hilarious. I didn\u2019t realize that. But I love the idea of being generous with your ideas because, when I first started my career, I was so paranoid, I wouldn\u2019t\u2026 People would say, \u201cOh, what are you working on?\u201d \u201cOh, I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d even though it was probably some lame thing that no one\u2019s going to steal and, if they did steal it, so what \u2013 it\u2019s all about execution. So, this is a crazy story. I\u2019m much older than you so, when I very first started \u2013 when I got out of college \u2013 there were still libraries and that\u2019s where you would go to research things. And I was doing joke book on the eerie similarities between Jesus and Elvis because Elvis had said that he believed he was the second coming. And I was so paranoid that I went to two different libraries \u2013 so I went to one to get books about Elvis and one to get gooks about \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: You didn\u2019t want anyone to put two and two together? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Isn\u2019t that insane \u2013 the level of delusion there? Who cares? And now, I feel, telling people my ideas, that the positives outweigh the negatives \u2013 that you meet people who are interesting that can help you or expand the idea. I don\u2019t know if you know Adam Mansbach who wrote Go, The\u2026 I don\u2019t know, are you allowed \u2013 do you want the \u201cbleep\u201d on this or no? Go the F to Sleep. Tim Ferriss: Oh, no. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we have lots of cursing on this show. It\u2019s deliberately not Falwell-compliant. So, yes, Go the Fuck to Sleep. Brilliant. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. And he \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Brilliant. Brilliant. Which became a huge bestseller because it got leaked, as far as I can tell, as a PDF among people in the publishing world. A.J. Jacobs: Oh, that\u2019s so interesting. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a part of how it became a huge best seller. A.J. Jacobs: Well, that\u2019s similar to\u2026 Because he had put it up as a Facebook update as a joke \u2013 like he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to write a book called Go the F to Sleep \u2013 and people are like, \u201cYou should do that.\u201d So, the idea of sharing and being out there with your ideas, that\u2019s been a big change in my career. Tim Ferriss: So, just to touch on that because I think it\u2019s really important idea, Neil Strauss does this. Although, when he is working on something, he is tremendously paranoid about it. A.J. Jacobs: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: When he\u2019s already committed to writing something \u2013 I\u2019ve known Neil forever \u2013 and he still will not\u2026 He\u2019s afraid of letting out the meme. But I do think these are two different things \u2013 once you\u2019ve fully committed to doing something and when you\u2019re testing the water, I think, are two distinct phases. But I remember when I was proofreading his book, Emergency, No, 1, the only reason he let me write about it \u2013 or, rather, read it \u2013 was because he wouldn\u2019t tell me what he was writing about \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t tell me, he wouldn\u2019t tell me \u2013 and I just threw out this Hail Mary and I said, \u201cWhat is this? Some five flags stuff?\u201d \u2013 which is very insider terminology for all sorts of prepper survivalist multiple passport communities. And his eyes got about the size of a dinner plate and he said, \u201cWhat have you heard? What have you heard?\u201d And then he would give me, printed out, 15 to 20 pages at a time to proofread and then I would have to give those back before I could have the next set. A.J. Jacobs: I love it. Were they color-coded? Tim Ferriss: They were not color coded, although, knowing Neil, I\u2019m sure there are some type of identification numbers on them. But he is very generous with is ideas until he decides where he\u2019s going to go all out. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: And Kevin Rose, very close friend of mine, serial entrepreneur, extremely successful investor, does the same thing. And Kevin Kelly, founding editor of Wired, one of my favorite people out there \u2013 I think he\u2019s probably the real-world most interesting man in the world, a technology futurist who spends time with the Amish almost every year to determine how they accept and vet technology, fascinating guy \u2013 he also tries to give away or kill as many of his ideas as possible. And, if he can\u2019t give them away, he can\u2019t kill him, and they stick with him and him alone, then those are the ideas he considers pursuing. A.J. Jacobs: Interesting. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So, in a way, giving ideas away is one of his filters \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 to determine what he should work on because he is a man of a lot of ideas. He may have 20 different project ideas. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: And, the ones he can\u2019t give away, when that group overlaps with \u2013 or, I should say, rather, when you combine the ones that he can\u2019t give way with the ones that he can\u2019t kill \u2013 because he can\u2019t find flaws in them, some fatal flaw \u2013 those are the ones that he ends up pursuing. A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s so interesting. I love that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But we were talking about, earlier on, being grateful for the little things. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: And then Neil came up because he wrote this Rolling Stone piece on \u201cThe Age of Fear\u201d and how everyone\u2019s terrified \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and think the world\u2019s going to hell in a handbasket in every possible respect but, objectively, things seem pretty good. A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. And I totally believe that and there\u2019s that great Steven Pinker book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, which traces the history of violence and how we are in the safest time ever even with the horrors of the 20th century wars. And, yeah, there was a great magazine called Mental Floss \u2013 which just folded a month ago, but they still have a web presence \u2013 and I wrote a monthly column. I can\u2019t remember\u2026 I wanted to call it \u201cThe Good Old Days Sucked\u201d but I don\u2019t think it ended up being called that. But the premise was we have this nostalgia \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Wait, Modern Problems? A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. Exactly. Modern Problems. Tim Ferriss: There we go. A.J. Jacobs: You are\u2026 See, you\u2019re better than me. Tim Ferriss: I just happened to read your Wikipedia more recently, I think, than you. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, so the idea was, every month, I would take a different topic and show how horrible life used to be and how grateful we should be. Not all of us \u2013 there are still people in other countries and even in our country living in horrible conditions \u2013 but, if you\u2019re lucky enough, we live in, by far, the best times and there\u2019s so many examples. The first one, I think, was on medicine and the one I talked about in the first paragraph, I believe, was the smoke enema, the tobacco enema, which is\u2026 You know the phrase \u201cBlow smoke up your ass?\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah. A.J. Jacobs: That was a literal thing. It came because they would have a hose and a pump and they would shoot tobacco up your butt because they believed that it was good for your stomach and good for your health. Tim Ferriss: Okay. This might explain something that I\u2019ve been trying to figure out for a few years now. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: I\u2019m intrigued. What\u2019s your point? [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: A friend of mine sent me a photograph of the menu of a whorehouse in the early 1800\u2019s and it was like, blow job, $2.00, whatever, this type of sex, $3.00, this type of sex, $1.00, and then it had \u201csmoke up the ass,\u201d $30.00. A.J. Jacobs: Wow. Tim Ferriss: And I was like, \u201cWait a second. I want to know what the smoke up the ass is about.\u201d I was very curious because I was like, \u201cWhat was the\u2026\u201d but maybe this was actually the medicinal option on the menu. A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. It was like\u2026 That is fascinating. Tim Ferriss: How did something so highly prized come to be associated with deceitful flattery \u2013 blowing smoke up your ass? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, that is\u2026 it\u2019s a weird segway. I don\u2019t know what to make of that. Tim Ferriss: Alright, so the tobacco enema, back in the day? Just be glad\u2026? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: So, yeah. I\u2019m sure you can still find it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s somewhere out there if you Google it. Oh, you know what else to be thankful\u2026? If you ever are feeling down, I would Google the words, \u201cSurgery without anesthesia\u201d and read the first-person accounts of people who had surgery and it is just\u2026 Oh my god, it is just\u2026 Tim Ferriss: That does not sound appealing or pleasant in the least. A.J. Jacobs: No, it was crazy. Yeah, this one woman wrote one and it was just\u2026 I couldn\u2019t sleep for days. So, even when I\u2019m going to the hospital for a procedure, I\u2019m like, \u201cAlright, at least we\u2019ve got anesthesia.\u201d So, it has made my life better, this idea. Tim Ferriss: And, yeah, people out there, you can definitely find Neil\u2019s piece on this as well which I think it\u2019s a good recalibration. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I remember something was really bothering me \u2013maybe I ran across something about ISIS drowning people in cages or burning people alive \u2013 both of which are horrible, horrible, horrible things. And I was having a conversation with someone I won\u2019t mention but very, very famous and successful technologist and he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cAll terrible but thank god we\u2019re not in the Middle Ages.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cBroadly speaking, humanity would be much worse off than we are now with these edge cases.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Absolutely. And, on that theme, you can also Google \u201cLouis C.K. on Conan,\u201d I think something like; \u201cEverything is great and everyone\u2019s miserable,\u201d which is \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Alright, so as long as we\u2019re doing standup\u2026 I was not going to mention this but I will because I think it\u2019s so hilarious. Living in San Francisco, I get overdosed on San Francisco sometimes. And there may be a place for this so, people out there who are aficionados, try not to freak out and just laugh at yourselves or laugh at this because I think it\u2019s pretty funny. Patton Oswald is one of my favorite comedians \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Great. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 has this piece where he opens, in effect, saying, \u201cIf one of my Whole Foods friends lectures me one more time on homebirths, I\u2019m going to punch all the soy in the planet.\u201d And he goes on to talk about \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to do it justice \u2013 but he\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what women were dreaming about on the frontier when they were squatting on the mud in a shack giving birth? Hospitals. These amazing sterile environments where you didn\u2019t have to worry about the wolverine sneaking in and stealing the afterbirth.\u201d And I want people to listen to it because I think it\u2019s so good. A.J. Jacobs: I love that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s easy to romanticize \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: It is so\u2026 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 the good old days when, in fact, the good old days were very frequently \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Terrible. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 terrible. The terrible old days. A.J. Jacobs: And, actually, that brings to mind, when I was researching the Bible, there\u2019s a line in the Bible where God says, \u201cBecause of Eve eating the apple, women have pain in childbirth.\u201d And when anesthesia for childbirth was first introduced, there were some super religious people who were like, \u201cOh no, we can have that. Women have to suffer.\u201d And so, thank god\u2026 My wife, she was like, \u201cGive me that drug. Give me it. Give it to me now.\u201d There was no chance she was going to do it naturally. Tim Ferriss: How do you choose your projects? These are big projects \u2013 book projects \u2013 and very time consuming. And maybe this is a way to edge into it, but what are some of the ideas that you came close to doing that you ended up not doing? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, well, there was the Kama Sutra which my wife put the kibosh on. Tim Ferriss: Vetoed? A.J. Jacobs: I think the answer, maybe not the most surprising, but I have to be totally passionate about it because it can\u2019t just be something that I think will be popular \u2013 it has to be something that I am super excited about. Because, like you, I commit to these things and maybe not to the level of Tim Ferriss, but I go in hard. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you do. You do. A.J. Jacobs: I try to be Tim Ferriss. You\u2019re my\u2026 I am the less successful, less famous Tim Ferriss. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, stop it already. How many best sellers have you had? Four? You\u2019re ahead of me, pal. A.J. Jacobs: Not in terms of quantity. But, yeah, I would say there\u2019s that and, if it makes me laugh\u2026 I once talked to a Daily Show\u00a0writer about his writing process and he said one of the most important things to him was that he could surprise himself while he was writing and I loved that idea \u2013 just being able to surprise yourself. And I feel that same way about big ideas. You have to\u2026 when you come up with the idea, you\u2019ve got to be like, \u201cOh, man. I love that idea.\u201d You amuse yourself. Tim Ferriss: Or just going, \u201cHuh,\u201d like, \u201cHmm.\u201d When that happens, I try to become better at that because I\u2019ve noticed\u2026 BJ Novak, who\u2019s a fantastic writer \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Sure. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and excellent, of course, actor and everything else \u2013 producer, well-known for The Office\u00a0and many other things \u2013 but he and Scott Adams as well \u2013 creator of Dilbert\u00a0\u2013 really pay a lot of attention to the kinesthetic body response to what they\u2019re writing. And so I\u2019ve tried to really hone in on paying more attention to that as I\u2019m writing, or drafting, or brainstorming, or anything and making a note of that. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s so interesting you say that because I\u2019ve never thought about this, but, when I\u2019m writing and I\u2019m writing something that I think might be funny, I can tell there\u2019s sort of a little ping in the back of my head like a little dopamine rush. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. A.J. Jacobs: And, yeah, I do try to pay attention to that. That\u2019s so interesting. I never verbalized it. And then just the idea\u2026 I do love, like I think you do, taking an idea and just pushing it to its logical extreme \u2013 just a reductio ad absurdum. So, when I first read about outsourcing, I was like, \u201cWell, this is cool. How can I push this to the extreme? How can I outsource every single thing in the world?\u201d and that\u2019s how I came up with the idea for those folks. Tim Ferriss: The beauty of reductio ad absurdum \u2013 also underestimated, I think \u2013 its power and its humor. So, you were saying, \u201cI have to be really excited about it. I have to, on some level, maybe find it funny,\u201d why genealogy? A.J. Jacobs: Well, this came \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not something that people generally think of as knee-slapping. A.J. Jacobs: It\u2019s true. Well, genealogy is a\u2026 Yeah, I try not to use that world. I say, yeah, \u201cFamily History\u201d \u2013 that sounds better \u2013 or \u201cConnections,\u201d or\u2026 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: There we go. A.J. Jacobs: But this came about because, a couple of years ago, I was at my desk and I got an email from a guy and he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me but I\u2019m your twelfth cousin.\u201d And I thought, \u201cOkay, next comes he\u2019s going to say, \u2018Please wire $10,000.00 to my Nigerian bank account.'\u201d But he didn\u2019t and I looked into it more and he\u2019s one of these group of people \u2013 they\u2019re researchers, and scientists, and geneticists \u2013 who are building a family tree, the biggest family tree ever, the biggest possible family tree ever, of every human on earth \u2013 connecting everyone on Earth in one family tree. And I was like, \u201cThat is a bold, crazy idea. I love it.\u201d So, that\u2019s how I dove into it and it\u2019s crazy. As I say, there\u2019s two ways you do it: with DNA but one way is one the internet, almost a Wikipedia-like model where thousands, millions of people are working on the same big family tree. So, I\u2019m on this tree which now has 100 million people. And one of the fun things that will take up a week of your life is you can figure out how you\u2019re related to almost anyone else. Like Barack Obama, for instance \u2013 this is true \u2013 is my fifth great aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife\u2019s seventh great nephew. So, we\u2019re pretty close. I\u2019m sure, when he\u2019s out of office soon, he\u2019ll be hanging with me. So, I loved this idea \u2013 it\u2019s like \u201cSix Degrees of Kevin Bacon\u201d but everyone is Kevin Bacon. And I became entranced and I decided this is my next book. And, for your listeners, actually, it has very practical implications because \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re always practical here on \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Show.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. This is a tool, for I believe, for Titans or non-Titans. But it is like the greatest social network ever \u2013 it\u2019s like LinkedIn on steroids \u2013 because I threw an event trying to hold the biggest family reunion ever and I needed publicity so I would find a reporter or a TV producer, I would figure out how I was related to them, I would sent them an email and say, \u201cListen, this may sound weird but you are my seventh cousin three times removed\u2019s husband\u2019s son so we\u2019re family. Would you do a favor for a cousin and write about my project?\u201d And I\u2019d say, maybe, 20 percent of the time, they were freaked out and like, \u201cStop stalking me,\u201d but, 80 percent of the time, they were intrigued. They were like, \u201cReally? We\u2019re cousins? Oh, that\u2019s so interesting,\u201d and I got more publicity that way than anything. Tim Ferriss: What was the subject line? Do you remember what the subject line would have been? A.J. Jacobs: I think it was\u2026 Tim Ferriss: \u201cFrom A.J., your relative\u201d? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, \u201cFrom A.J., your distant cousin.\u201d For my book about it, I wanted to interview George H.W. Bush because he\u2019s got this huge family so I emailed his chief of staff and was like\u2026 And she said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s not doing interviews.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, but I am a cousin,\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, well, you\u2019re a cousin? I guess we can make an exception,\u201d and I was able to go down and interview him. So, for another three years this will work and then everyone will realize, \u201cOh, wait. Everyone\u2019s cousins.\u201d But I highly recommend it as a strategy for now. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve got to make it count while you can. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: Why did you decide to do a podcast? A.J. Jacobs: Yes, I am \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Now, a number of fans of yours and mine said they loved your audiobooks. A.J. Jacobs: Oh, that\u2019s nice. Tim Ferriss: And I need to edit this out if this is not the right anecdote but I could swear that you told me, at some point, that you went to record your audiobook and the people at the studio \u2013 god, I want to say this was you \u2013 they said, \u201cWell, you seem to have a cold so why don\u2019t you come back when you don\u2019t have a cold?\u201d Is this the right story? A.J. Jacobs: No, that\u2019s hilarious but, you know what? It might well have been. I don\u2019t trust my memory so I have\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Well, one of my friends, at least, who has gone in \u2013 if it\u2019s you or somebody else \u2013 he went in to record his audiobook and he was so excited and they went on to be hugely successful and he recorded for ten minutes and the producer in the studio was like, \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s take a break and why don\u2019t we have you come in in a few days when your cold is over?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a cold. This is just what I sound like.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Love it. I know. I have an odd voice \u2013 I have an odd voice \u2013 it hasn\u2019t hindered me too much. Tim Ferriss: No, I\u2019m not saying that you have an odd voice. I was bringing it up because I thought that it was from you but it\u2026 A.J. Jacobs: Ah, well, I love it. But I will tell you, when I recorded my audiobook, I apparently had a very active stomach and so it was growling a lot and so I had to do a lot of retakes. And I was apologizing to the producers and they said, \u201cNo, that happens with everyone,\u201d and they, in fact, had a file of all these famous authors\u2019 body sounds \u2013 like Susan Sontag\u2019s farts or whatever \u2013 and I was like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put that out. That would be the most awesome album: \u2018Famous People\u2019s Bodily Functions.'\u201d But I don\u2019t think they did. Anyway\u2026 Tim Ferriss: So, the podcast, though? I took us off the rail. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, the podcast, I\u2019m very excited about. It\u2019s called \u201cTwice Removed\u201d and it\u2019s sort of an interview show, mixed with hardcore history, mixed with a game show so it\u2019s an odd mix. And the idea is we take a notable person and then we go through their family history and find the most interesting, inspirational stories and then talk about those. And then, at the end, we introduce them to a cousin they didn\u2019t know they had so it\u2019s sort of this surprise ending. And it could be someone like their hero, maybe, their mentor. It could be an ex-girlfriend. It could be anyone. Tim Ferriss: An ex-girlfriend? A.J. Jacobs: We haven\u2019t done that yet but\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Current wife? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, exactly. \u201cYou are cousins with your spouse.\u201d But, yeah, no, I\u2026 And it\u2019s being produced by Gimlet, who did \u201cStartUp\u201d \u2013 which I\u2019m sure, because you\u2019re friends with Chris Sacca\u2026 And so, yeah, \u201cStartUp,\u201d which is, as you or your listeners might know, it was a podcast about starting a podcast company \u2013 very meta. So, they are doing it and they are amazing because they\u2019re all like \u201cThis American Life\u201d alums and so they are just so good at editing, and crafting the story, and music. And I know nothing about it so it\u2019s been a fascinating learning experience. And I\u2019m learning, also, how to tell stories in an audio way which is different. So, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s fascinating. We\u2019ll see how it does but I\u2019m excited for it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they have a really good team. Alex Blumberg, he\u2019s also in Tools of the Titans and he\u2019s really good at asking questions because he records really long tape and is good at listening to emotion and the stories, specifically, like you said, from interview subjects. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. And he gives me \u2013 I\u2019m sure, since you interviewed him, you know \u2013 the silence. He\u2019s brilliant at using the silence just waiting. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, heck yeah. Letting the silence do the work? Yeah, he\u2019s really, really good and they\u2019ve had a whole string of really successful shows \u2013 \u201cReply All,\u201d \u201cMystery Show\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ve had a very, very consistent hit rate so\u2026 A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. They\u2019re the best. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So, I will be certainly checking that out. [01:28:07] A.J. Jacobs: And we actually had one that\u2019s sort of related to some of the stuff you do. We had Abby Jacobson, who\u2019s on Broad City\u00a0\u2013 she\u2019s a hilarious comedian \u2013 but one of her ancestors was this entrepreneur, a woman entrepreneur. So, we had a whole segment on female entrepreneurs through history including Betsy Ross. We all think of her just sewing the flag but, apparently, she had a team. She was a Titan. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Titan? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Huh. A.J. Jacobs: And same with JFK\u2019s great-grandma who came over and opened a button shop and the Kennedys would not have existed if she hadn\u2019t been an entrepreneur and funded her kids\u2019 education and then they, whatever, got into liquor and that spawned the political dynasty. Tim Ferriss: The gateway to all good things. A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So, you are, of course, going to be promoting the podcast, you\u2019ve promoted books in the past, and you\u2019ve done various types of PR and marketing. One of the bullets that I wanted to talk about was \u2013 and this is in your voice \u2013 but, \u201cHow I learned to love marketing.\u201d Because a lot of authors, a lot of artists, certainly, think of marketing as sullying their hands with the dirty work of commercialism or an evil to be avoided. So, how did you learn to\u2026? A.J. Jacobs: Well, partly inspired by Tim Ferriss but, partly, it was I reframed marketing. I\u2019m trying to think of it not as the sullying my art but as something that could be creative in its own right. And part of this was I interviewed the artist, Christo \u2013 the guy who wraps islands and the gates in Central Park, a really interesting guy \u2013 and he was working on this one project for 24 years. He was trying to put up these gates in Central Park, these curtains and arches in Central Park \u2013 10,000 orange arches. And he had to deal with city bureaucracy for 24 years so I asked him, \u201cGod, that must have been so frustrating.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, yes and no,\u201d he said, \u201cI actually see dealing with the bureaucracy as part of my art. It\u2019s all part of one big art project so I don\u2019t separate it from the actual designing of the pieces.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting way to look at it.\u201d So, I try to apply that to marketing and, instead of seeing it as this horrible pain in the ass, \u201cWhat can I do that\u2019s creative with it?\u201d And one of the things, when I was doing The Year of Living Biblically, for instance, I was like, \u201cHow can I section this off so I can appeal to 50 different audiences?\u201d so I wrote a piece for a music magazine about music in the Bible. I did, for Glamour magazine, I wrote sex advice in the Bible \u2013 because there\u2019s a good amount of sex in the Bible. And it was actually very interesting. I became a fan of this way of thinking as opposed to being\u2026 And the same thing with speeches \u2013 I used to hate giving speeches \u2013 but, like we said before, the whole \u201cfake it until you make it,\u201d so I forced myself to do every speech I could and, now, I just love it. Actually, I\u2019m not a fan of sitting down in front of the keyboard but I\u2019d much rather be onstage talking. Tim Ferriss: Well, that\u2019s a part of the dangerous siren song of marketing. So, when I was working on Tools of Titans, I used a program called Scrivener to put together my books \u2013 I\u2019ve done that for the last three books \u2013 and I had a working file which was \u201cMarketing Ideas.\u201d And I found it was very dangerous to have that within a stone\u2019s throw of my writing because it was always easier \u2013 or more enjoyable \u2013 for me to work on the marketing ideas and to put off the actual work of writing. So, it had marketing ideas and I modified the file name so it was \u201cMarketing Ideas \u2013 FOCUS ON WRITING!!!\u201d in all capital letters and three exclamation points. A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s it. Now, if you had to rank the different parts of your job in terms of enjoyment that they give you, what would you say? Tim Ferriss: So, funny enough, this last book was the first one that I\u2019ve enjoyed writing. I love doing what I\u2019m doing right now, which is my favorite part of writing without the writing. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: The interviewing \u2013 I love the interviewing and the researching. I do enjoy the experimentation but those sometimes go sideways, as you and I both know, so those don\u2019t always turn out as intended or hoped. And then, probably historically, it would have been marketing and then the writing. But the writing was right there, I would say, if not at par with the marketing \u2013 maybe even ahead of it this time around \u2013 which was weird for me. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: And what do you think that was? Was it the topic or did you discover some hack to enjoy writing? [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: There were a few things. I think that, primarily, it was the enjoyment in assimilation of \u2013 this is kind of meta but \u2013 absorbing the lessons and recommendations of the people I interviewed as I was editing, and reviewing, and taking multiple passes on these chapters. A.J. Jacobs: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: So, I was actually incorporating a lot of the\u2026 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: What\u2019s an example? Do you remember one? Tim Ferriss: Sure. Oh, yeah. I ended up having a routine where, for instance, I used a barrel sauna with the exact same specs as Rick Rubin \u2013 who recommended it to me \u2013 and alternated that with cold exposure at specific times of the day, just like Wim Hof would. And, in the mornings, I would listen to, say, a guided meditation from Tara Brach and, specifically, the 2010 \u201cSummer Smile\u201d meditation which Maria Popova recommended to me. So, I started incorporating and then I would take, say, exogenous ketones \u2013 which are these powdered synthetic ketones \u2013 which Dominic D\u2019Agostino had recommended to me. So, all of these bits and pieces from the actual chapters became part of my daily routine for working on the chapters which is kind of wild. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s great, yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then there\u2019s the deeper kind of philosophical stuff. I was writing this mostly over the summer, early fall, and there were a few people in the book, like BJ Miller \u2013who is a palliative care physician who\u2019s helped more than 1,000 people die \u2013 and Ed Cooke \u2013 memory champion who taught, you might remember a book called Moonwalking with Einstein\u00a0\u2013 A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, Ed Cook is the memory champion/coach who taught, in this case, I think it was Joshua Foer \u2013 those Foer brothers, both amazing writers. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Three of them \u2013 there are three. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Three, that\u2019s right. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: There\u2019s a third one. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So, to become National Memory Champion in the US in one year. So, Ed Cooke and BJ Miller both use stargazing as a way to reduce anxiety and they both have particular ways that they go about it. So, I did that every night before going to bed. And it just went on, and on, and on so I think that the subject matter, itself, had a huge impact on the writing of the book which was unexpected, in a way. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. That is, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and the marketing, at this point for me, is fun because I try to make it fun in the sense that I very often ask myself, \u201cHow can I make the launch, itself, PR worthy?\u201d if that makes sense. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: And that forces me to do sometimes absurd things and, even if some of the absurd things are what I might consider, or people might consider, a waste of money, like doing billboards in New York City right now. I have 80 plus billboards in New York City with the answers from guests to the question \u201cWhat would you put on a billboard if you could put anything on a billboard to get a message out to millions of people?\u201d So, I got all these answers and took some of my favorites and now they\u2019re on actual physical billboards all throughout New York City. That probably doesn\u2019t sell a lot of books but it gives me such childlike joy to do something that absurd and to make guests happy, themselves, that even if it is a waste of money, it\u2019s probably not a waste of money. Meaning, in isolation, maybe it\u2019s a waste of money but, because of the infusion of enthusiasm that it\u2019s given me and the excitement it\u2019s created among many of the guests and people who ended up in the book, it\u2019s acted as fuel for a lot of other things that actually do have financial return \u2013 or at least a clear financial return. A.J. Jacobs: I love that. That is funny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, that \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: I had a similar experience. I\u2019m finishing my book on the family now but, as part of it, last summer, I threw the biggest worldwide family reunion ever and that was, financially, not a great idea but it was so fun and so interesting and I hope raised the profile enough that it will pay off in the end. But, yeah, because it was 4,000 people in New York but then there were 40 simultaneous reunions around the world and Sister Sledge came and sang \u201cWe Are Family.\u201d One thing \u2013 this was a revelation \u2013 Sister Sledge, \u201cWe Are Family,\u201d I\u2019m like; \u201cThis is the perfect song.\u201d Tim Ferriss: The anthem. A.J. Jacobs: This is\u2026 But it turns out one of the sisters is not talking to the other \u2013 some sort of lawsuit \u2013 so they\u2019re family in the sense that every family is dysfunctional. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s grab a couple of fan questions and then we\u2019ll jump into some rapid-fire questions. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: This is a question you probably get a lot. I certainly get it a lot but I\u2019m curious how you\u2019d answer it. This is from Constantine Inozentsev \u2013 I can\u2019t pronounce it but it\u2019s I-N-O-Z-E-N-T-S-E-V. Which experiment or approach turned out to be a total dud? Something that you had extremely high hopes for that completely flopped? A.J. Jacobs: I did start off \u2013 and you probably will remember this guy\u2019s name \u2013 but the guy who invented the idea of microexpressions where you \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Right. A.J. Jacobs: Where you\u2026 Paul\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Ekman. A.J. Jacobs: Yes. Tim Ferriss: There we go. A.J. Jacobs: And his idea was\u2026 He was like the show about the little eyecatcher \u2013 \u201cYou can tell who\u2019s lying based on their facial expressions.\u201d So, I interviewed him \u2013 great interview \u2013 and I tried it and I just couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a pseudoscience or whether because it\u2019s my failure \u2013 probably the latter \u2013 but it just\u2026 And it\u2019s fun to write about failures but not when there\u2019s just nothing but failures. I think you need a little\u2026 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s no lesson learned \u2013 just couldn\u2019t do it. A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Alright. This is from Miguel Fligere, I think it is. \u201cBook outtakes from your year of living Biblically \u2013 was there anything that didn\u2019t make it in that\u2026?\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Ah, interesting. I did\u2026 Yes, there was. In Orlando, there\u2019s a theme park called The Holy Land Experience, which is the Disney version of ancient Jerusalem. And so you\u2019ve got, instead of mascots like Disneyworld, you\u2019ve got Jesus. You\u2019ve got this guy with robes and a beard and he\u2019s got a little Madonna TED face-mic and he\u2019s talking\u2026 And you\u2019ve got these guys \u2013 lepers, that was my favorite \u2013 blind lepers begging on the street with his little microphone. And they read\u2026 But, anyway, I went there and it could have been a funny chapter in that I found it very ridiculous but it was also like shooting fish in a barrel or, I think P.J. O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cShooting cows with a sawed-off shotgun.\u201d It was just too easy. And there are people, I\u2019m sure, that it was meaningful to so why ruin their lives just for a cheap laugh? So, that didn\u2019t make it. Tim Ferriss: So, this is \u2013 these are all related, I suppose \u2013 this is from Anna LeMonte and I\u2019ll try to simplify this a little bit or I might rephrase it after I read it. \u201cIt would be great to hear your take on whether it\u2019s possible to completely rewire our subconscious to ignore the norms and expectations instilled by society, family, environment, etc.? Or is it a never-ending work in progress \u2013 something that you need to become aware of and focus on every single day?\u201d So, I think part \u2013 if I can read into this \u2013 maybe what is being asked or implied is that we both do all these crazy experiments \u2013 how have you trained yourself to ignore the norms and conventions? But \u2013 and this is directed at both of us \u2013 for me, yeah, I would say the writing is just the ultimate excuse. It\u2019s the perfect alibi to do any absurd thing you could possibly conceive of. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: And I just say I\u2019m writing about it and people are like, \u201cOh, okay that\u2019s fine.\u201d But, if you were doing it seriously, right, if you didn\u2019t have the pretext of writing about it for The Year of Living Biblically, \u2013 I\u2019m sure plenty of people thought you were crazy anyway \u2013 but there are people who would have assumed you were completely insane who otherwise were like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s so genius. Wow, what a great idea.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Absolutely. I think that\u2019s it. I think, if you almost see yourself as a method writer instead of a method actor and just get into character\u2026 I often do that. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get into character now. This is not me. This is me.\u201d And I think that you don\u2019t have to be a writer to do that, actually. I think the idea of experimenting on your own life, even if you\u2019re not writing a book\u2026 I think it\u2019s great to just try eight different toothpastes and see which works. But there is a sense where you have to commit and be like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to force myself to do this. I\u2019m going to take on a character and I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d So, that, I find very helpful. Tim Ferriss: And I think, also \u2013 I would say this to Anna or anyone \u2013 is that, if you frame something \u2013 even if you\u2019re not writing about it \u2013 as an experiment, like \u201cI\u2019m doing X for Y number of months,\u201d you also can kind of get away with murder in the sense that, if you\u2019re worried about trying something unusual or uncommon, you can get to, \u201cWhat should I test?\u201d by the extension to reductio ad absurdum. Right? A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: Okay. If people are outsourcing like you did, \u201cWhat is the most absurd, exaggerated place I can take this? Alright, passive aggressive bickering with my wife. I\u2019m going to have someone do that on my behalf,\u201d or having\u2026 I actually\u2026 This might be another misattribution but I know it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. This one, I think I\u2019m getting right. You hired someone to be worried on your behalf? A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. I found that extremely helpful. Tim Ferriss: So, I thought that was\u2026 And you found it really helpful and that sounded so absurd but I remember, I think it was The Four-Hour Body, I was really stressed out about the deadline, and so I paid a virtual assistant to worry about my deadline for me. And it was such a weird form of, not necessarily self-deception, but taking advantage of a quirk of human psychology to know that someone else was on the job. A.J. Jacobs: Yes. I love that. Who was your virtual assistant? Was it an Indian or\u2026? [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I hired someone, I think, from the Philippines. A.J. Jacobs: Philippines? They\u2019re good worriers, yeah. That is awesome. Well, and I also think calling it an experiment gives you permission to fail because it\u2019s an experiment and sometimes experiments fail. So, if you do a change in your life and say, \u201cI\u2019m experimenting with this,\u201d it makes it\u2026 And it reminds me of \u2013 I\u2019m probably going to get this wrong but \u2013 I think it was a French writer named Montaigne who came up with the word \u201cessay\u201d which means \u201cto try.\u201d So, I find that so freeing \u2013 when you write something, you\u2019re just trying. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yup. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: You\u2019re just trying. It may work, it may not. Tim Ferriss: And the more \u2013 this has been true for me \u2013 the more experiments you attempt and the more you try to push the absurd in certain respects, the easier it gets because you realize the penalties are generally not that severe. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: With some of the stupid stuff that I do, they end up, physically, being pretty severe and you can get very injured. Like don\u2019t try to learn parkour in a week \u2013 it turned out to be a very bad idea for your knees. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: I remember, I saw you recently after you had done that and you were\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Brutal. I was not in good shape and still have injuries from that. But, generally, if you\u2019re doing these experiments that you think you\u2019re going to be judge very harshly for, if you\u2019re presenting them in the right way \u2013 if you feel compelled to explain them \u2013 generally, there are very few repercussions and people are actually more supportive and interested than you would expect. A.J. Jacobs: Right. And, also, if you get something good out of it for your own life, then it\u2019s probably worth it unless you inflict massive pain on others like with radical honesty. Tim Ferriss: Yes, radical honesty, that\u2019s another one I want to explore a bit. There\u2019s a great book called Lying by Sam Harris. A.J. Jacobs: Oh, yeah. I read that. Tim Ferriss: I think it\u2019s a great book. A.J. Jacobs: It\u2019s a great book. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Very complimentary to the \u201cI Think You\u2019re Fat\u201d essay. So, this is from Charlotte Chapman \u2013 most embarrassing failure at an experiment? So, aside from the microexpressions \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 most important failure at an experiment? \u201cDid he give up or refined his approach?\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Interesting. Yeah, I think my life has been a series of embarrassments and humiliations so\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Well, in a way, you engineer your experiments to be embarrassing. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s true. Yes, exactly. Because I\u2019d also think that makes better copy is\u2026 And that is actually one thing that I was thinking about that I learned doing this podcast is that being humiliated on the radio actually sometimes makes for better radio so, when I\u2019m doing interviews and I ask a question and the person is like, \u201cGod, that\u2019s a dumb question,\u201d that is beautiful. Tim Ferriss: Always makes the cut. A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s gold, yeah. So, I may not sound that good on the podcast but I think it\u2019s entertaining so\u2026 But, yeah, I would say many humiliations. I don\u2019t know if this counts \u2013 but this is the first one that comes to mind \u2013 I was working at Esquire magazine and we asked the actress, Mary-Louise Parker, to pose nude. And I was tasked with asking her. And she said, \u201cWell, I will pose nude but only if the editor of the piece also poses nude,\u201d and I was the editor. So, I went to my editor-in-chief and he was like, \u201cAlright. Do it. Take off your pants. That\u2019s your job.\u201d So, I had to pose nude for a very well-known celebrity photographer and it was quite humiliating, and vulnerable, and also highly insulting because he\u2019s a big photographer so he had ten assistants \u2013 gorgeous, 20-something female assistants \u2013 and I was like, \u201cOh my god, this is so embarrassing,\u201d but they could not care less. They were like\u2026 no interest in my nude form so that was tough for my ego. And then it came out and they actually published the picture and we got some subscription cancellations, I believe. So, overall, it was a dark time. Tim Ferriss: Alright. Let\u2019s do some rapid-fire questions which may, in fact, be misnamed but they\u2019re short questions \u2013 the answers don\u2019t need to be short. When you hear the word successful, who\u2019s the first person who comes to mind or who comes to mind? A.J. Jacobs: Well, this is a little schmaltzy of an answer but I would say my dad. He is a lawyer who loves his job. He literally has no hobbies because all he loves is spending time with his family and his job. So, if you can derive that much pleasure from your job, I think that\u2019s a success. To me, there are two criteria for success: one is that you\u2019re happy and the other is that you\u2019re making the world a better place and I think he does both. And, also, he is definitely, in our genre, taking things to the ridiculous extreme, he writes law books and he holds the world record for the most number of footnotes is a law article \u2013 4,280. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh my god. A.J. Jacobs: So, yeah. So, he finds something and he just goes with it. Tim Ferriss: Wow. The apple does not fall too far from the tree on that one. I don\u2019t ask this with everyone but I\u2019ll ask this with you \u2013 what is something you believe that other people think is insane or that very few people would agree with you on? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, I love this question and there are many, many things so let me just go over a couple of them quickly without trying to alienate too many of your listeners. Tim Ferriss: Oh, no. Alienate away. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah? Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re tough. A.J. Jacobs: Alright. One is cannibalism. I\u2019m \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Wait, what about it? You\u2019re a proponent? A.J. Jacobs: I am a proponent of ethical cannibalism. Tim Ferriss: Okay. A.J. Jacobs: I\u2019m very interested and excited about in vitro meat, lab-grown meat \u2013 like you take a little cell from a chicken and grow a chicken breast or\u2026 So, I\u2019m very excited about that and I think, in 10 or 20 years, it\u2019s going to be reality and it\u2019s going to open up\u2026 You don\u2019t have to just eat cows or chickens. You could \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: You could have a human burger? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, a human burger. Well, I was thinking a giraffe or endangered animals but, yeah, take it to the extreme. What is the harm in eating another human \u2013 a human burger? And this is my idea for a startup \u2013 I think you\u2019ve pulled back on angel investing so\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. A.J. Jacobs: And maybe \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: There are plenty of them listening, though. A.J. Jacobs: Alright. Someone may already be doing this but my idea is celebrity meat. So, you can\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Eat a Brad Pitt burger? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Or eat a Clooney burger, or eat a J. Lo burger. And it can even be specific body parts like\u2026 That\u2019s a little creepy but\u2026 Tim Ferriss: I wonder what will end up being the Kobe beef of humans. So, if you can choose gender, race, and so on, where do we end up? A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: Right? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t know. A.J. Jacobs: I don\u2019t know so that\u2019s what \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: All these questions just begging to be answered. So, cannibalism, okay. That\u2019s one. A.J. Jacobs: Another one? Like Sam Harris, I don\u2019t believe in free will which I think is\u2026 Some people see that as depressing but I actually find it liberating because it\u2019s so much easier to forgive yourself for doing stupid things if you realize that you really didn\u2019t have\u2026 there was no other \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The die has been cast? A.J. Jacobs: The die has been cast. And I think you\u2019re more forgiving of other people and the stupid thing you do. Tim Ferriss: Now, conversely, though, couldn\u2019t you also be more forgiving or accepting of things that should not be condoned? Or is that just coming back to the lack of free will and you\u2019re sort of\u2026? A.J. Jacobs: Well, my feeling is there is a difference between fatalism and determinism. So, you can believe that you don\u2019t have free will but, of course, our decisions make a difference. If I just, for the rest of the month, just lay here on this couch, my life would fall apart. I realize that. So, I\u2019m not saying\u2026 Our decisions make a difference \u2013 it\u2019s just those decisions are pre-determined. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a big subject. A.J. Jacobs: Oh, and I did have\u2026 Wait, what was the other one that I did want to bring up? Shoot. Well, it\u2019ll come back to me. Tim Ferriss: We can come back to it. What \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Oh. One last one. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah? Shoot. A.J. Jacobs: Which is multiverses. I know a lot of physicists believe in multiverses but it really hit me with this election cycle because it is so\u2026 I can see, at the convention of universes \u2013 of the multiverses \u2013 and our universe is going to be getting just a ton of crap like, \u201cGuys, this is the universe where Donald Trump is president. Can you believe that?\u201d And we\u2019d be like \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So, if the multiverse is actually a collection of kids in school and you\u2019re saying that we\u2019re going to be taunted? A.J. Jacobs: I think so. I do believe that. Tim Ferriss: Okay. A.J. Jacobs: So, yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking about recently. Tim Ferriss: What book or books have you gifted the most to other people besides your own? A.J. Jacobs: I would say \u2013 I can\u2019t remember if you had him on or not as a guest but \u2013 Jonathan Haidt. Tim Ferriss: I have not had him on as a guest. A.J. Jacobs: He is a great writer. Tim Ferriss: How do you spell his last name? A.J. Jacobs: H-A-I-D-T. And I may be confusing him with \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s come up a couple times in conversation with friends recently. A.J. Jacobs: The guy did a great TED Talk and he wrote a book called The Righteous Mind and it\u2019s all about trying to figure out the gap between the red and blue states \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2013 and it\u2019s really interesting. And he likens it to almost taste buds, like Republicans have different moral taste buds than Democrats and\u2026 Tim Ferriss: I think The Righteous Mind may have been recommended to me by a neuroscientist about a year ago \u2013 a Ph.D. in neuroscience. So, The Righteous Mind? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in recent memory? A.J. Jacobs: That is a good question. Well, one thing I do love is my elastic shoelaces. Do you use those? Tim Ferriss: No. I like this idea, though. I was just fussing with shoelaces yesterday and got so fed up that I went and found a different pair of shoes that I had packed which do not have shoelaces. So, elastic shoelaces? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. So, you just replace the cloth shoelaces with these elastic\u2026 I think it\u2019s called \u201cLace Lock\u201d is the brand I use. And, yeah, shoelaces seem like such 18th century technology. It\u2019s so crazy we still use them and, these ones, you just slip them on and they, for me at least, they\u2019re just as tight and secure. Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re also not as mental institution as Velcro shoes. A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: You don\u2019t have to make the jump to Velcro. You can go in between with these. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Yeah, Velcro, if you\u2019re under 7 or over 80, you can get away with Velcro but, in between, it\u2019s hard. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any particular morning rituals? Anything that is particularly important to you that is not obvious? Like, yes, you want to keep your kids alive and I\u2019m imagining feed them in some form and fashion, but are there any other morning routines or rituals that are important to you? A.J. Jacobs: Well, one we talked about is sort of the mental calisthenics. I find that helpful. Another you talked about in your books which is the restricting information \u2013 information diets \u2013 and I have tried, sometimes successfully, to stop reading the newspaper or any news in the morning because then I just get depressed and spiral. I find it good to read news right before I go to bed because then I get depressed and I\u2019m able to fall asleep. So, that, for me \u2013 keeping your mind clear away from news in the morning \u2013 is crucial. Tim Ferriss: If you were to give a TED Talk on something you are not known for \u2013 so you\u2019ve given a lot of talks but something you are not associated with or known for whatsoever \u2013 what would it be on? A.J. Jacobs: Oh, that\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s a good one. Let me think. I don\u2019t know, this might be repetitive but talking about all the ways that the past is horrible. I think that I could go on for\u2026 I know you only have 20 minutes over a TED Talk but I could go on for four hours. Tim Ferriss: Is there anything you obsess on, or over, or on the evenings or weekends? So, something, a pet obsession of yours, that you\u2019ve not talked about? A.J. Jacobs: Let\u2019s see. Yes, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m slightly obsessive person, as are you. So, yeah \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Slightly is very generous, in my case, at least. A.J. Jacobs: I\u2019m trying to think. I would say, I guess, that I do have the fear of missing out \u2013 not on parties but on ideas. I\u2019m always nervous that I haven\u2019t read enough and that there\u2019s great ideas and I\u2019m just woefully ignorant so that\u2019s, I guess, something. Tim Ferriss: And then you read the newspaper before you go to bed and get depressed and, voila? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Exactly. That\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss: If you think about bad advice, what is some bad advice that you hear given out often in your world? And you can define that any way you want \u2013 it could be writing, it could be\u2026 A.J. Jacobs: I do have one. I have one that\u2019s a pet peeve of mine which is, \u201cBe yourself,\u201d because what if yourself is an asshole? Like, Stalin, he was being himself. \u201cLet Stalin be Stalin.\u201d That guy was really being himself. So, I think, if you think about this a little more \u2013 a little less flippantly \u2013 I think there are things that are very deep enough \u2013 if you\u2019re gay, you\u2019re gay, don\u2019t try to change that \u2013 but there are aspects of our personality that we think are ingrained but that can be changed. Like I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a very outgoing person naturally \u2013 I think I would spend most days just indoors reading \u2013 but I force myself to be social and sort of force myself to get out there, and it\u2019s made my life better because you interact with people and you\u2019re happier. So, don\u2019t just be yourself. Try to be the best parts of yourself but then take the worst parts of yourself and try to change those. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. A.J. Jacobs: Which I think you do, right? Tim Ferriss: No, I agree with that. I agree with that advice and I think there\u2019s also, \u201cBe yourself,\u201d implies that you\u2019re a finished product, in a sense, too. Right? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Which is where I take issue with the obsession with, \u201cDiscover yourself,\u201d where, maybe, as a complement to that, at least \u2013 maybe even an alternative \u2013 \u201cCreate yourself,\u201d may be, in some ways is more accurate. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Even though we think of this persistent \u201cI\u201d \u2013 this persistent Tim, this persistent A.J. \u2013 from the cells in our body to just about every other aspect of our being, we are constantly in flux. A.J. Jacobs: Yup. I love that. Works in progress. Tim Ferriss: So, I may not have time to put this up in the next few weeks but, if you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere to get a message out to millions of people \u2013 that could not be an advertisement \u2013 any short message? A.J. Jacobs: I was thinking about this because I know you ask it. One thought that occurred to me is something like, \u201cLife is too complicated, and subtle, and filled with grays to be summed up on a billboard so don\u2019t pay attention to billboards,\u201d \u2013 something meta like that. I did a piece on effective altruism. I know you interviewed \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Will MacAskill. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. And I am a fan of that way of thinking just how lucky we are and trying to give back so maybe\u2026 Is that\u2026? Tim Ferriss: If you \u2013 [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: But that would be an advertisement. Tim Ferriss: No, not necessarily. You could have, \u201cIf you make more than $68K per year, you\u2019re in the global 1 percent.\u201d A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, something like that. It\u2019s interesting because you got to use guilt very\u2026 Guilt will only get you so far. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. A.J. Jacobs: That might get you in the door but then this feeling of empowerment of helping others, I think, is a better motivator for altruism. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, I think it\u2019s more, if you\u2019re looking to optimize the lifetime value of a donor as opposed to a single transaction that they then resent, then, yeah, guilt is not the primary tool. [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: At least it seems that way, just working with a number of non-profits myself, mostly, and educational stuff. So, I sometimes ask people what advice they would give their younger self. I\u2019m going to pose it a different way because you have this aged photo of yourself \u2013 your 82-year-old self \u2013 in your house. What advice do you think your 82-year-old self would give your current self? A.J. Jacobs: That is a good one. I like that twist. I think \u2013 and I try to do this \u2013 I think my 82-year-old self, hopefully, will be wiser and happier. I do think, overall, my level of happiness has risen which is nice. So, hopefully \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Trending in the right direction? A.J. Jacobs: So, hopefully \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 that continues. And I guess I battle this, even today, is, \u201cDon\u2019t be so opinionated. Don\u2019t have such strongly held beliefs that they can\u2019t be changed with evidence.\u201d I think that this society has a weird fetish with strongly held beliefs like, \u201cThese are my deep seeded beliefs and, if you change them, you\u2019re a flip-flopper.\u201d And I think we\u2019ve got to rebrand \u2013 flip-flopping is great as long as you\u2019re doing it based on evidence and not on whims. You have the ability to and the courage to change your convictions \u2013 not just the courage of your convictions but the courage to change them. So, maybe, I would tell myself, \u201cWork on that part of your personality.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s what makes a good scientist as well, right? A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, exactly. Right. Tim Ferriss: What is one of your favorite personal failures? And what I mean by that is, specifically, a failure that led, in some way, to a later success or set the stage for a later success? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: Right. Well, I have had many, many failures as we\u2019ve discussed and I am a big fan of them. And rejection \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things I try to teach my kids all the time like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get rejected 98 percent of the time. You\u2019ve just got to keep going.\u201d I don\u2019t know if this falls into the right category but NBC, a couple of years ago, optioned my life \u2013 one of my books \u2013 and it was going to be a comedy where, every week, it was this writer did another wacky experiment and chaos ensued. And it was a total failure \u2013 it didn\u2019t get picked up \u2013 but the lesson I learned was I actually made a conscious effort\u2026 I was like, \u201cYou know what? This may or may not get picked up but I am going to consciously enjoy this experience and get everything I can out of it.\u201d I got to mean Donald Sutherland who played my father-in-law. My wife was played by this woman who had much bigger boobs than she did so she loved it. And it was just a blast. And I would go into meetings and I would be like, \u201cWhat if the main character,\u201d \u2013 who was named A.J. \u2013 \u201cwhat if he did this?\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, A.J. would never do that.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cHuh. Well, maybe he would.\u201d But it was just so much fun and there\u2019s one producer who I read a book of hers and she\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, if you cannot enjoy the process, then you\u2019re screwed because the chances of getting a movie actually made are so infinitesimal and so enjoy the process and enjoy the walk up the mountain, not just the summit.\u201d That was a big lesson. Tim Ferriss: If you think back, can you think of the best or one of the best investments you\u2019ve ever made? And that could be time, energy, money. I\u2019ll give you an example. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, Amelia Boone \u2013 three-time World\u2019s Toughest Mudder Champion, most decorated obstacle course racer in the world, full time attorney, also, at Apple \u2013 but it was her first entrance fee for one of these races which was, I think at the time, $400.00 or $450.00 which was a stretch. It was a real expenditure for her but it opened up this entirely new career. A.J. Jacobs: Right. Tim Ferriss: Had she not taken that, who knows? Can you\u2026? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: I love that. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: It doesn\u2019t have to be analogous to that but\u2026 A.J. Jacobs: Well, can I go the other way and\u2026? I have two ideas: one is, about a month ago, I wrote an article for Esquire where I got the most expensive haircut in the world in New York City \u2013 an $800.00 haircut. And it was crazy because it was this guy, it was on Park Avenue, his name was Julien Farel, and he was very French, he said, \u201cHaircut.\u201d And it was a fascinating learning experience because, of course, it\u2019s not worth $800.00. That\u2019s insane. It\u2019s 20 percent better than my Supercuts which cost $20.00. But, just learning he gets clients \u2013 he is booked all the time. How does he do this? He\u2019s got Goldman-Sachs guys who come in every week for an $800.00 haircut and it\u2019s all about the experience. Because the actual cutting is not that different, right, but the experience \u2013 the cappuccino, and the music, and he\u2019ll stare you deep in the eyes and talk to you about what your hair means to you and how it can change your life \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Tough task ahead of him with me, if I go there. A.J. Jacobs: Maybe you get a discount. Tim Ferriss: Although the small remaining parts I have still mean a lot to me. A.J. Jacobs: There you go. So, yeah, it was fascinating. That\u2019s how he does it. And he\u2019ll look at your skull for five minutes like an artist. Tim Ferriss: Or a phrenologist. A.J. Jacobs: Yeah, a phrenologist. But so he\u2019s able to get clients by making the experience even though the price is just so ridiculous. Tim Ferriss: Maybe it\u2019s because the price is so ridiculous. A.J. Jacobs: That\u2019s a good part of it, exactly. He is just\u2026 So, anyway, I thought that was a\u2026 I did not pay for it, luckily \u2013 Esquire paid for it \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yup. A.J. Jacobs: So, I guess, one of my first books was about reading the Encyclopedia Britannica when they still actually printed that. So, there were 33 volumes and I read them all and that cost $1,500.00 to buy that set \u2013 which is an absurd amount for a book \u2013 but it turned out it paid off. Tim Ferriss: So, would you say it was that book that was one of the biggest inflection points for you as a writer? If something put you on the map as a writer, was it that book, or was it an earlier piece, or a different piece? [Crosstalk] A.J. Jacobs: No, it was definitely that \u2013 it took it to a different level. And I had written a couple of other books before but they were sort of novelty short books like one was called America Offline about this wonderful world outside of the internet where you could actually meet people face-to-face and it sold four copies. It came out, I think \u2013 it probably sucked \u2013 but it was also ahead of its time so that probably\u2026 Both played\u2026 But I think the key was that that was the first one with real emotion and it was sort of an emotional ark and I talked about my father, I talked about the meaning of life \u2013 in a lame way, I tried \u2013 and that connected with people. I think emotion really does that and that\u2019s one of the big lessons of this podcast that I\u2019m doing with Gimlet is getting those emotional moments really makes a difference. Tim Ferriss: So, let\u2019s wrap up on a question directed, well, at you but for the audience. So, for people listening \u2013 and I\u2019ll certainly tell them\u2026 Well, we\u2019ll have two questions. The first one is not related to where they can find you and so on which is going to be the last question. This one is really do you have any suggestions, recommendations, parting thoughts for people listening? Something they could try or something that they can just carry with them that might be helpful or useful in some way? A.J. Jacobs: Aside from all the brilliant stuff we talked about for the last two hours? Tim Ferriss: It could be one that you want to underscore. A.J. Jacobs: Well, I think we both talk about this \u2013 the idea of experimenting with your life is so important because, I think, if you do the same\u2026 Routines are good in some ways because they automate things so some parts of your life should be automated but, sometimes, routines cause you to get in a rut like the neurons actually get in a neural rut. So, doing simple tricks to just shake up your life, I\u2019ve found it incredibly enriching. I think you have? Tim Ferriss: For sure. A.J. Jacobs: And, as I said, it could be just trying a different toothpaste every month. There\u2019s millions to\u2026 I used Crest for 28 years because some kid at my camp used Crest and I thought he was cool so I kept buying it. And I actually don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like it but it took me 28 years to\u2026 and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know what? Let me try some other stuff.\u201d Tim Ferriss: And, as you said also \u2013 I think this is worth repeating and I\u2019m paraphrasing, here \u2013 but it\u2019s often easier to act your way into thinking differently as opposed to thinking your way into acting differently. A.J. Jacobs: Totally. Yeah. And, yeah, the quote is \u2013 which is not mine \u2013 is, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting,\u201d and I do love that. Tim Ferriss: A.J., it\u2019s always fun to hang out. We\u2019ve seen each other a little bit this trip in New York City which has been fun. A.J. Jacobs: Great. Tim Ferriss: And where can people find you and learn more about you on the internet, the podcast, etc.? Where can people check you out and say hi? A.J. Jacobs: The podcast is called \u201cTwice Removed\u201d and it is on ITunes \u2013 Gimlet Media. And my website is AJjacobs.com, @AJJacobs on Twitter, and my book about family \u2013 not genealogy \u2013 is coming out in the fall of 2017. Tim Ferriss: Very, very cool. A.J., thank so much for taking the time. A.J. Jacobs: Thanks. I loved it. Tim Ferriss: And, to everybody listening, as always, you can find the show notes, links to everything that we discussed at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast \u2013 all spelled out \u2013 fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

and we\u2019re going to get into all sorts of experiments but, since we\u2019re talking about writing, a number of people in my fan base asked about your writing process \u2013 and so we\u2019ve talked about your writing, the subject of writing, but i don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever talked about your writing process", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, i\u2019m happy to talk about it", "i think we actually did because, when you were researching how to write a book, you barely had come out \u2013 [crosstalk] that\u2019s true", "i asked you a little bit about structure", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "but i don\u2019t know\u2026 at the time, i remember i was in argentina \u2013 i was in buenos aires \u2013 i was sitting in a coffee shop drinking a cappuccino which was double espresso", "this must

describe for folks\u2026", "i guess there are two questions about the writing process: one is micro on, say, a daily basis, when you are writing a book, what that day looks like", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "and then there\u2019s how do you decide what to write about", "so, \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: which do you want to tackle first", "whichever you would like to tackle first", "a.j", "jacobs: well, let me tackle the micro really quickly which would be one thing i like to do first is a little mental calisthenics before i start writing just to warm up my brain", "so, i\u2019ll brainstorm \u2013 maybe it\u2019s about the book a bit, itself, or an article but it could just be random stuff", "like it could be, \u201coh, i saw a snowman", "what can we do with that", "maybe we could do a snow transgender person or a snow neanderthal.\u201d and 99 percent of the ideas suck, as you can tell, but the idea is just to get your creative juices flowing and \u2013 [crosstalk] and you\u2019re writing those down or you\u2019re just doing them inside your head", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: yes, i\u2019m typing them down and, as i say, none of them\u2026 very few of them ever see the light of day but that\u2019s just to get my fingers typing is another thing", "i feel just the movement of my fingers on the keys gets me revved up and gets me so that i\u2019m more comfortable typing", "the other thing i like to think about is i know that the first half hour of actual writing my book, that is probably going to suck", "and so i just have to accept that and be okay with throwing it out but you\u2019ve got to do that half hour before your brain clicks in", "so, that\u2019s what i do", "i do need three solid hours", "some people can do it where they can write in spurts of 20 minutes", "i am not one of those people", "i can\u2019t do it, either", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "and i remember i got some very good advice a few years ago because i was getting very frustrated by the, in my mind, wasted half hour that you mentioned and someone said, \u201cwell, you have to realize that, if you write ten pages and you only get one really good page at the very end, those nine pages are not a waste of time", "you needed those nine pages to get to the tenth page.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "exactly", "i\u2019d prefer to have a better ratio but i\u2019ll take it", "a.j", "jacobs: i know", "yeah, there is some warmup", "yeah", "i wish it could be more like high intensity interval training \u2013 you\u2019re in and you\u2019re out \u2013 but it is more like stretching and\u2026 do you tend to do it first thing in the morning or when do you write", "a.j", "jacobs: i do\u2026 well, i have kids so that makes my life a pain the ass", "so, i have had to train myself to write at all hours so sometimes in the morning and sometimes at night", "mm-hmm", "and do you drink coffee", "a.j", "jacobs: i do drink coffee", "i also, i have to say, i enjoy my white wine because \u2013 [crosstalk] that\u2019s mostly mornings", "a.j", "jacobs: i am a day drinker", "i actually prefer drinking during the day", "but, yeah, there are studies that show that you\u2019re slightly more creative after, i think, one glass", "after two or three glasses, then it all goes to hell but, one glass, it sort of loosens up the frontal cortex and allows you to make more connections", "or it convinces you that you should be more loosened up and you have the placebo effect benefit", "a.j", "jacobs: there you go", "and you sent me over a quote \u2013 and i don\u2019t know if this is a quote of yours or if it\u2019s attributed to someone else \u2013 but i really enjoyed this and i think it applies to a lot of what you do, not just your writing", "but here\u2019s the quote: \u201cit\u2019s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting.\u201d can you elaborate on that or provide us some more context for that", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "i love that quote and i think it applies to both of us", "i think \u2013 [crosstalk] it definitely applies to both of us", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, i think a lot of what your work is\u2026 and, yeah, i wish i could say i made it up", "it was the founder of habitat for humanity whose name escapes me right now but it was a wonderful quote", "and the idea is just \u2013 it\u2019s basic cognitive psychology \u2013 when you act in a certain way, then your brain will catch up", "but, in terms of change, i find that much easier", "like i wrote a book about the bible and living by the bible and one of the things was you had to be more compassionate", "and so i had a friend in the hospital \u2013 i hate hospitals, i hate them \u2013 so i was like, \u201ci\u2019m not going to visit that guy.\u201d but then i thought, \u201cwhat would a compassionate person do?\u201d and i acted as if i were a compassionate person and i forced myself to go to the hospital to visit him", "and then, in my brain, i\u2019m like, \u201coh, you know what", "i am kind of compassionate.\u201d you sort of trick your brain", "your brain catches up", "and i\u2019ve done that and, especially, with optimism and confidence", "i don\u2019t think i\u2019m a naturally confident person but i act as if i\u2019m confident and, eventually, become more confident", "so, in the realm of confidence, what embodies confidence for you", "what are the ways in which you act", "a.j", "jacobs: well, for instance, when i wrote a book about health, it was sort of my attempt at the four-hour body and i was so overwhelmed because it\u2019s such a huge topic and i was trying to be the healthiest person alive aside from tim ferriss", "and so it\u2019s such an undertaking because there\u2019s so much \u2013 there\u2019s sleep, and there\u2019s sex, and there\u2019s food, and exercise \u2013 so i was all stressed out but then i acted\u2026 [crosstalk] every morning, i would wake up full of despair but then i would act as if i was confident", "so, i would call my publisher and say, \u201cokay", "when we have the release party, let\u2019s have kale martinis", "what do you think of that?\u201d so, i was acting all cocky as if this is going to come out and be a big hit", "and, after two or three hours, your brain catches up and i actually felt more confident and i really find it\u2019s so helpful", "so, i\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot recently because there\u2019s so much talk of mind over body \u2013 and so this is, i guess, a corollary to this quote \u2013 but i\u2019ve been thinking a lot about body over mind", "and this is something tony robbins talks a lot about \u2013 if you want to change your psychology, changing your physiology first", "and it\u2019s a lot easier, also, in the sense that, if you haven\u2019t reasoned yourself into a position of, say, a lack of confidence \u2013 or at least you haven\u2019t done it consciously \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to reason your way out of it so you just have to act as if\u2026 a.j", "jacobs: oh, yeah", "absolutely", "i agree", "and it\u2019s in every part of my life", "like i did one experiment where i tried to be the best husband ever and i forced myself to buy a present for my wife every day \u2013 just a little trinket even if i was totally pissed at her and wanted nothing to do with her", "but just that act of giving it to her, it was like, \u201coh, i\u2019m giving her a present", "i must love her,\u201d and it really changed my view", "so, i am a big fan", "and we\u2019re not the only ones: i read about teddy roosevelt who, for a while, he was trying to be a cowboy \u2013 he was actually in, i think it was, montana \u2013 and someone asked him, \u201caren\u2019t you terrified?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cof course i\u2019m terrified when the bull is coming at me but i just act as if i\u2019m courageous and i become a little more courageous.\u201d so, it sounds like \u2013 and i read this comparison on, i think, 99u \u2013 one piece may be method acting \u2013 although i know nothing about it, i\u2019m just using the label \u2013 and then there\u2019s the second component which is something that i like this phrase \u2013 and it\u2019s capital \u201cd,\u201d capital \u201co\u201d \u2013 delusional optimism", "can you elaborate on that", "because it seems like they go together", "a.j", "jacobs: yes, i am a fan of delusional optimism which is very similar to what we\u2019ve been talking about", "i think nothing would get done without delusional optimism", "one example is i interviewed george clooney, once, for esquire \u2013 who, by the way, is as charming as you expect george clooney to be", "he gave me an unsolicited shoulder rub, shoulder massage, so that was\u2026 i\u2019ll always have that", "but, anyways, so i asked him about what are his secrets to success and he said one philosophy he has is that he used to be a baseball player in high school and, when he got up to the plate, he wouldn\u2019t just say to himself, \u201cam i going to hit a home run?\u201d he would say, \u201cnot only am i going to hit a homerun, but the only question is am i going to hit it over the left wall or the right wall?\u201d and i loved that, just like\u2026 and, of course, most of the time, he didn\u2019t", "most of the time, he struck out but it raised the percentage of times that he did hit a home run because he had that delusional optimism and i loved that", "and you have to be careful \u2013 it can lead to terrible things", "so, you have to have some \u2013 especially if you\u2019re in an organization \u2013 you want the ceo to be delusionally optimistic and then you want someone else to be sort of the bean counter and be like, \u201ci don\u2019t know about this,\u201d \u2013 a balance", "but you really do, i think, need that delusional optimism to get things done", "and, if we\u2019re then\u2026 rewinding a little bit and going from the micro book writing process\u2026 actually, before we leave, the daily writing process, i\u2019ve talked to a lot of my friends who are typically journalists out of newspapers and they drive me crazy and they make me very envious because they talk about how writer\u2019s block doesn\u2019t exist and they can kick out 1,500 beautiful words every few hours and they seem to be able to do it \u2013 a lot of my friends who have worked at different papers", "do you experience blocks or extended periods where you\u2019re just stuck on projects", "and, if so, what do you do to help get yourself out of those funks", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: oh, yeah", "i get blocked all the time", "i actually wrote an article once on writer\u2019s block and the way that great writers have overcome it", "i remember, i think, ben franklin wrote in the nude", "a lot of writers wrote standing up \u2013 like nabokov wrote standing up", "there\u2019s a german philosopher named schiller who needed rotten apples to inspire him", "so, i tried them \u2013 like tim ferriss, i tried them all at the same time: standing up, naked \u2013 [crosstalk] with rotten apples", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: \u2013 with rotten apples", "i don\u2019t know if that was successful but i will say one of them is similar to what i said before which is just start writing and, as long you expect that it\u2019s going to suck, it lowers the pressure", "so, a lot of times if i\u2019m stuck, i\u2019ll just start writing about the coffee cup, or the pigeons on the windowsill, or how my elbow itches, and just the fact of moving your fingers \u2013 like we talked about, how much your body affects your mind \u2013 moving your fingers gets you going and helps", "but, yeah, it\u2019s a problem", "people who say they don\u2019t have writer\u2019s block; they drive me crazy, too", "and you mentioned \u2013 this is going to jump around because that\u2019s the style of my brain \u2013 but you mentioned \u2013- and this is a question that came up from quite a few listeners to the podcast \u2013 the year of living biblically which was one of my favorite books of yours", "i really, really enjoyed it", "and i\u2019ve told you this before, but i learned more about\u2026 as someone who developed an allergy to organized religion pretty early on and, therefore, never learned much about it, it was a fantastic trojan horse for me through the entertainment value and the humor of the book to actually learn a lot about a number of different religious traditions", "a.j", "jacobs: well, bless you, tim", "well, that \u201cbless you\u201d leads me to the question which is; what are the things that have stuck with you", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, the \u2013 [crosstalk] because there\u2019s one that stuck with me which is \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: really", "[crosstalk] well, you talked about wearing white", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, yeah", "and so maybe you could explain what that means but it\u2019s actually something that i\u2019ve ended up doing on a fairly regular basis since i read the book", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: i love that", "me, too", "although you\u2019re wearing dark blue now", "i\u2019m wearing dark blue right now because all my white stuff is filthy", "a.j", "jacobs: alright", "but imagine how much better this interview would be if you were wearing white and i was wearing white", "i\u2019m wearing white socks", "yeah, well, this book\u2026 just to give a very quick background for those who don\u2019t know, i grew up with no religion at all", "as i say in the book, i\u2019m jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian so not very \u2013 no offense", "but i thought one way to learn about religion would be to dive in and actually follow every rule in the bible, so the famous ones like the ten commandments, but also the less famous ones like it says you can\u2019t shave the corners of your beard", "i didn\u2019t know where the corners were so i just let the whole thing grow and i had this huge topiary and i got stopped at airport security so it was a crazy year", "but one of the \u2013 [crosstalk] the robes probably didn\u2019t help at airport security", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: yeah, the robes, and the sandals, and the walking stick", "yeah", "as you say, getting into it physically really makes a difference", "and one of the rules in the bible \u2013 and i think it\u2019s ecclesiastes \u2013 says that your garments should always be white", "so, i took that literally and i only wore white pants, white shirts, and white robes and it was weird how it affected my mind, as you know", "it made me feel lighter and more energetic", "i felt like there\u2019s just something about wearing white like, \u201coh, i\u2019m going to p", "diddy\u2019s hamptons party or i\u2019m going to play wimbledon.\u201d it\u2019s got positive associations", "and here, in new york, people wear dark clothes all the time and i think \u2013 [crosstalk] very noir", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "it affects your mind", "so, has that continued to be a piece or what has continued to play a part in your life from that book and from that experience", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "i do like the brighter clothes more than i used to", "i would say, a lot of it, i gave up", "i did shave the beard because, my wife, she wouldn\u2019t touch me with that thing even though i kept it very clean \u2013 i moisturized, conditioned, and shampooed it", "but, in terms of stuff that i have actually kept, i would say one thing that really has stuck with me is that the bible talks about that you should be grateful all the time", "it says that you should be thankful and say prayers of thanksgiving", "so, when i was doing the book, i took that literally so i would be thankful for everything", "so, i would press the elevator button, i\u2019d get in the elevator, and i\u2019d be thankful it didn\u2019t plummet the basement", "i\u2019d press the elevator button and i\u2019d be thankful the doors opened and i got to my floor", "so, it\u2019s like hundreds of little, tiny things a day and it was a weird way to live \u2013 very time consuming \u2013 but also, there was something wonderful about it because it made you realize, very concretely, there are hundreds of things that go right every day that you totally take for granted and i, at least, used to focus on the three or four that went wrong and just stew on them", "so, i\u2019ve tried to keep that radical shift in perspective of being thankful for all the tiny little things that go right and it has made me happier", "it\u2019s definitely had an impact", "so, i want you to, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, describe for people one of my favorite stories in the book \u2013 stoning adulterers", "a.j", "jacobs: well, yes, i was doing a lot with the old testament \u2013 the hebrew scriptures \u2013 and it says over and over again you have to stone adulterers", "so, i thought, \u201calright, let me try to check this off the list,\u201d so, one day, i was in central park and i was wearing my whole\u2026 i had my robe \u2013 [crosstalk] the whole getup", "a.j", "jacobs: i had the getup, the sandals, and a man came up to me and he said, \u201cwhy are you dressed like that?\u201d and i said, \u201cwell, i\u2019m trying to follow all the rules of the bible from the ten commandments to stoning adulterers.\u201d and he said, \u201cwell, i\u2019m an adulterer", "are you going to stone me?\u201d and i said, \u201cwell, that would be fantastic", "thank you for the offer.\u201d so, i took a handful of stones out of my robe pocket \u2013 because i had been carrying them around for weeks hoping\u2026 because there were no specifications in terms of the size of the stones", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: yes", "exactly", "that was the key", "i showed it to him and i\u2019m like, \u201cthey\u2019re small stones", "i can check it off the list even if they\u2019re small stones.\u201d and he was a very aggressive adulterer", "he grabbed the stones out of my hand and then threw them at my face", "so, i thought, \u201can eye for an eye", "i can chuck one back at him.\u201d so, that\u2019s how i checked it off the list", "and, yeah, i didn\u2019t continue that", "there were quite a few i did not continue including, if you follow leviticus really strictly, you can\u2019t touch a woman when she\u2019s menstruating because she\u2019s impure but, if you take it really literally, a woman, if she\u2019s menstruating, if she sits on something \u2013 a chair \u2013 that chair becomes impure", "and my wife found that offensive so she sat in every chair in our apartment and i had to stand for most of the year which, as you know, is probably good for you", "probably good for your health", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "well, you had a travel stool, right", "you had one of those \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "\u2013 for a sporting event", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "those were great", "yeah", "they\u2019re usually used by people who are either 83 or 600 pounds but i found it very useful", "so, a number of folks \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to get too deep into the audience questions right now \u2013 but we had quite a few questions about your wife and how you managed your relationship with your wife given all of these odd experiments", "and did you, in some indirect or subconscious way, select someone who\u2019d have a high tolerance for all this", "a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s a great question", "or how do you repair damage when damage is done", "a.j", "jacobs: it is interesting", "first of all, she has veto power so there are\u2026 i\u2019m sure you get this all the time, readers suggesting ideas", "one suggested, \u201cbecome the greatest lover in the world and do all the positions in the kama sutra,\u201d which you kind of did in the four-hour body but i\u2019ve been married for 12 years so that was not going to happen", "i did pitch it to her and she\u2019s like, \u201cno", "not this and i have to say i was a little relieved because i don\u2019t think i can bend my back like that anymore", "so, she has veto power and that\u2019s rule no", "1", "and, 2.) i think she gets a lot of reader feedback about how she\u2019s so patient", "that helps so please keep sending those in", "positive reinforcement", "a.j", "jacobs: i will say, probably, the worst one for our marriage was\u2026 you know the life-logging movement, where you keep track \u2013 [crosstalk] record everything", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, record everything", "it\u2019s like the self-tracking \u2013 quantified self taken to the extreme", "so, i had a little tiny camera, smaller than a gopro, on my ear and i recorded every moment of my life for about three months and it was fascinating", "and i think it\u2019s a glimpse of the future", "i think we are all going toward that for better or worse", "but one of the things was i was like, \u201c70 percent of my arguments with my wife are about where she says \u2018you didn\u2019t tell me that,\u2019 and i\u2019m like, \u2018yeah, i did", "i did tell you that.'\u201d so, now i\u2019m like, \u201cyou know what", "now we can rewind and we can see what we actually said", "so, we had a huge argument about something \u2013 whether she had asked me to order mexican food \u2013 something ridiculously small and trivial but it blew up and i was able\u2026 the next day, i\u2019m like, \u201cokay, let\u2019s rewind and watch the argument.\u201d and it was so terrible for our marriage because it was like\u2026 i can\u2019t remember, i think i might have been 60 percent right but the net was that i was 0 percent right because she was so upset and you don\u2019t want to show someone yelling or angry", "it just is not\u2026 so, i don\u2019t recommend that as a way to navigate a marriage", "in fact, there was a black mirror\u2026 do you ever watch black mirror", "i was going to say", "there\u2019s a great episode \u2013 i think it was in the first or second season, the uk edition of the\u00a0black mirror\u00a0\u2013 fantastic episode", "a.j", "jacobs: it was the same exact premise", "very similar premise but you record through your eye, effectively", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "it was great", "i love that show and that was\u2026 and, in the episode, things go horribly awry with his marriage", "which i think is probably also likely to happen \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "[crosstalk] \u2013 if that becomes a ubiquitous technology", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "what did you learn from that experience, aside from not to replay the mexican takeout debate for\u2026", "a.j", "jacobs: i think, well, one thing i learned is to\u2026 i have hundreds of hours of material so i\u2019ll never be able to watch it because it\u2019s just an infinite loop but i think one is to enjoy the small moments \u2013 if you do watch it, you just realize that 90 percent of your day is\u2026 when you\u2019re getting my kids ready for school, if you are annoyed during that half hour because it\u2019s a pain in the ass, that\u2019s a half hour of your life wasted", "you have to realize, \u201cthis is it", "this is what most of life is,\u201d so try to enjoy that as well as your playing laser tag or whatever because that\u2019s very rare", "or serving kale martinis at your launch party", "a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "that never happened", "so, that was one", "also, the implications for the future are fascinating", "how\u2019s it going to affect crime", "how will anyone mug someone when it\u2019s all being uploaded immediately to the cloud", "so, it will, i think, help crime but it\u2019ll be terrible for marriages", "and i feel for future adulterers and my heart goes out to them because i can\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re going to get away with sneaking around when everything is fully recorded", "well, on the flip side, it\u2019ll clarify a lot of crimes that are not committed, where people are wrongly accused", "a.j", "jacobs: well, that\u2019s true", "[crosstalk] so, you have the flip side, also", "a.j", "jacobs: well, that\u2019s true", "yeah", "and i think, also, it might make us more tolerant of people\u2019s mistakes because we all do something\u2026 the youtube video of people melting down and acting like idiots \u2013 everyone will have one of those", "no one\u2019s perfect so we\u2019re all going to have our flaws right out there on display so we have to accept those in ourselves and be a little more tolerant of others", "so, it\u2019s going to be a weird future, i really believe \u2013 fascinating, but weird", "yeah", "the question for me is, in all these cases, who are going to be the dominant owners of this information and controllers of the bits and bytes that represent all of these videos", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: right", "i know", "but i want to come back to tolerance \u2013 and i\u2019m not sure this is a perfect segway but i\u2019m going to force it \u2013 radical honesty", "so, you wrote a piece\u2026 i believe it was titled, \u201ci think you\u2019re fat.\u201d am i right", "a.j", "jacobs: yes", "that is completely true", "it\u2019s about radical honesty", "could you describe for people\u2026", "and then i want to come back and i\u2019m going to ask you about your thoughts on marriage and parenting but this ties in, i think, on some levels", "so, radical honestly, could you describe \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: absolutely", "[crosstalk] \u2013 the origins of this experiment, and what you did, and where you ended up which i don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really talked about", "a.j", "jacobs: no", "well, and to be radically honest, thank you", "you tweeted about it a few weeks ago and, as per usual, your endorsement gets me more readers in one tweet than i get from months of trying to do publicity", "i loved the piece so it was my pleasure", "a.j", "jacobs: well, thank you", "yeah, this piece came about because i read about this guy in virginia, a psychologist named brad blanton \u2013 a fantastic character, one of the greatest interviews of my life \u2013 and he believes that you should never lie, but he goes further", "he says that whatever\u2019s on your brain should come out of your mouth \u2013 no filter \u2013 like jim carrey in liar, liar", "so, it is insane", "and i was like, \u201cwell, let me try this and see what happens", "maybe he\u2019s right", "maybe it will make my life better despite the challenges.\u201d so, i did it and, oh my god, it was the worst month of my life in many ways", "in some ways, it was wonderful, liberating, and terrific", "in other ways, it was just dreadful", "and, to give you one of the dreadful ones, we would go to a restaurant and we would see friends of my wife that she hadn\u2019t seen since college and they said, \u201coh, we should all get together and have a playdate with our kids,\u201d and i had to say what was on my brain which was, \u201cyou guys seem nice but i have no interest in ever seeing you again because i don\u2019t have time to see my own friends.\u201d and they would just look at me aghast and my wife, of course, was furious", "and the one thing is we never did see them again so, in that way, it was effective", "it worked out", "a.j", "jacobs: but i felt terrible and i still feel it was totally a terrible thing to say", "so, there was that", "it did affect me in that i still\u2026 i\u2019m not radically honest like\u2026 because he\u2019s crazy", "he\u2019s like, if you see a beautiful woman on the street, you say, \u201chello", "i\u2019m very attracted to you", "i would like to sleep with you,\u201d which i got, weirdly, a lot of people \u2013 20 something guys saying they were using that as a\u2026 as their masterful pickup line", "a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "and they said the rejection rate was 95 percent but, if you\u2019re okay with that, then 5 percent of the women were like, \u201chmm, interesting.\u201d \u201cinteresting proposition", "i like the confidence/asperger\u2019s.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "but what i have kept from that is i try to do what i call \u201cradical sustainable honesty\u201d or \u201cpositive radical honesty\u201d because i don\u2019t need to tell people, \u201ci\u2019m staring at your mole,\u201d because that just doesn\u2019t help the world, i think", "but, for instance, one of the things i did is, when i was doing that, i would be thinking, \u201cyou know what", "i really like that boss of mine when i was 22 at the small newspaper", "he had a very nice influence on me", "let me call him up and thank him.\u201d so, i would call him out of the blue and it was very awkward because men are not supposed to express emotions like that but i would tell him how much he meant to me", "and it made me feel so much better and i hope \u2013 i think \u2013 it made him feel better", "so, i feel that that\u2019s something i\u2019ve tried to keep", "if i have a positive thought, then even if it\u2019s embarrassing or weird, then i will say like, \u201ci love you, man,\u201d or that kind of thing", "and i think that has made my life better", "so, i was given a similar assignment by an ex-girlfriend a number of years ago because i was having trouble \u2013 and this is no secret to people who\u2019ve read, certainly, a few of the chapters in tools of titans or in other places \u2013 that i\u2019ve had my ups and downs in my managing of depressive periods and what not", "and she said, \u201cwell, if you\u2019re having trouble making yourself happy, maybe you should identify one person every day you can send a short thank you to or call to give a thank you and, specifically, people from long ago or people you used to be close to or who had a huge influence on you that you are no longer close to.\u201d and so i started doing this and calling teachers i had in high school or childhood friends and it had a hugely uplifting impact on me", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: yeah, that\u2019s great", "i love that", "did it ever go wrong", "did it ever have some\u2026", "no, it never went wrong and, sometimes, it wasn\u2019t even about speaking in person so, if i got a voicemail, i would just leave a heartfelt voicemail", "it never went sideways for me", "and, in fact, it reinvigorated, i guess, or resurrected a few childhood friendships and now i\u2019m back in close contact with a number of these guys i went to grade school with and used to play with on a daily basis on bmx bikes or whatever the hell\u2026 throwing dirt clods into each other\u2019s eyes in the middle of the forest or whatever we were doing at the time", "so, it\u2019s been great", "it\u2019s been really, really great", "a.j", "jacobs: i love that", "how do you\u2026", "if you\u2019ve dismissed the option of being able to say to someone, \u201cyou seem very lovely but i don\u2019t ever want to see you again,\u201d \u2013 which, in a sense, is fantastic because you\u2019re able to cut down on all of these social expectations and commitments and i think a lot of people are just drowning in coffee invitations, cocktail invitations, \u201clet\u2019s do this,\u201d \u201clet\u2019s do that,\u201d \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to practice this more moderate honesty, how do you think of handling it in a place like new york city, in particular, where you have endless options", "a.j", "jacobs: i don\u2019t know", "i need your advice on that", "i am terrible at it", "i will tell people the truth which is, right now, i am so overwhelmed that i don\u2019t have time for basic hygiene and that they wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with me, anyway, because i smell and i\u2019ve got yellow teeth", "and that is the truth so maybe that\u2019s my best answer", "but, yeah, it\u2019s a tough one", "the best i\u2019ve been able to figure out \u2013 this is actually something i borrowed from\u2026 i\u2019m not going to mention him by name because i don\u2019t know if he\u2019d want this to be public but he\u2019s a very well-known billionaire tech investor in silicon valley who\u2019s always been very generous with his time", "and we\u2019d met up a number of times and i\u2019d asked him if he\u2019d be open to grabbing dinner", "and i wasn\u2019t vague about it because i think, at this point in my life, i\u2019ve learned, \u201clet\u2019s hang out,\u201d isn\u2019t good enough for someone who has so many demands on their time", "this was like, \u201ci\u2019d love to meet up to chat about this, this, and this, but only if you have time,\u201d but we\u2019d had dinner a number of times in the past", "and he said, \u201ci would love to but i\u2019m taking a meeting vacation.\u201d and so i started applying this to everything", "i\u2019m like, \u201coh, it\u2019s brilliant,\u201d because it\u2019s not personalized \u2013 \u201ci can\u2019t do it, tim ferriss, because i don\u2019t like you.\u201d it\u2019s, \u201cno, i\u2019m not doing any meetings.\u201d he said, \u201ci\u2019m not doing any meetings", "i\u2019m actually doing no phone calls", "i\u2019m just responding to things via email because that\u2019s the only way i can manage my schedule right now,\u201d and it was so generalized that i felt totally fine with it", "so, i started applying that to anything i didn\u2019t want to do", "\u201ci\u2019m taking a conference call vacation", "i\u2019m taking a meeting vacation", "i\u2019m taking a fill-in-the-blank vacation.\u201d and i also began putting that in my auto-responders so that i didn\u2019t feel obligated to \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: i think i\u2019ve gotten a couple of those, yeah", "you\u2019ve most certainly gotten them", "everyone gets a lot of those from me", "a.j", "jacobs: i love that", "who can be angry when you\u2019re taking a vacation", "everyone needs a vacation", "everyone needs a vacation", "a.j", "jacobs: well, and it is interesting, yeah, another thing that i do is \u2013 and some people don\u2019t approve of this, you may not but \u2013 if i\u2019m totally swamped and someone asks me out to lunch, then i say, \u201cwhat would you think about a skype lunch where we both order in food, and we have lunch, and we get to talk to each other, we get to see each other, but we don\u2019t have to schlep, and we don\u2019t have to waste time, we don\u2019t have to ask the waiter for the check.\u201d and i\u2019d say 30 percent of people are offended but 70 percent are willing to try and i\u2019ve found it very useful", "skype lunch", "a.j", "jacobs: skype lunch", "i\u2019ve never tried that", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: skype dinner, skype breakfast, whatever you want", "and i did it once with this guy who was tech savvy and he had the background of us in a caf\u00e9 in paris so it was very nice", "so, you had your own lady and the tramp\u00a0moment \u2013 virtually", "that sounds very pleasant", "a.j", "jacobs: i don\u2019t know whether i was lady or the tramp", "or both", "you could be both", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "so, there were a couple of bullets we, in preparation for this\u2026 because i\u2019m very familiar with a lot of your work \u2013 i\u2019ve read, i think, all of your books up to this point and \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: got you", "and so you sent a number of bullets i didn\u2019t expect or i wasn\u2019t familiar with so i wanted to talk about a few", "and i feel like, some of these, we have maybe touched on briefly, but i wanted to revisit", "being kind to your older self \u2013 can you explain what this means", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "i learned this while doing the health book and the idea was\u2026 i think it was a yale professor \u2013 i forget his name \u2013 but \u201cego-nomics,\u201d i think, is what he called it", "and the idea was, when they do experiments and they remind people of that they are going to be around in 20 years, people make more responsible decisions like, financially, they invest more in their 401k and, also, health wise, they act more responsibly", "so, i thought this was fascinating so i took it and i took just a selfie and i digitally aged it on one of those apps and so i now look like i have a skin disease but it\u2019s me at 82", "and i printed it out and put it over my desk and that older a.j", "is always looking down and saying, \u201ctreat me well", "remember; treat me like you would treat a friend", "and just don\u2019t eat that fourth oatmeal cookie and get on that treadmill.\u201d so, i find it very inspiring and motivating", "and is it something that you\u2019re able to continuously notice or do you tune it out after a while", "this is a challenge that i\u2019ve had with certain reminders", "so, i have a quote, for instance, from marcus aurelius on my refrigerator in san francisco and it\u2019s about trying to regain the harmony as quickly as possible, etc., etc", "it\u2019s one of these very marcus aurelius-type quotes and there are a number of them around my house", "but i will occasionally schedule a rotating of the quote or even location because, otherwise, it just becomes part of the scenery and i don\u2019t notice it", "so, \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: so, i love that and i had the exact same thing", "if you leave it in the same place, you\u2019re going to forget about it", "what i do is i make it part of my rotating screensaver so that \u2013 [crosstalk] got it", "okay, this makes sense", "a.j", "jacobs: \u2013 so that it pops up every couple of days and then, \u201coh, yeah, i should.\u201d but you\u2019re totally right \u2013 we are so good at tuning things out that have been there", "necessarily, right", "evolutionarily, it\u2019s like, \u201calright, if there\u2019s a piece of furniture i don\u2019t need to have some type of acute fight or flight intensity level observation of it.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: right", "\u201cbecause it\u2019s clearly not having a direct impact on my survival.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: and i had that same experience with photos", "i had a screensaver that was a photo of my family and i totally tuned it out after three days so i started rotating photos to remind myself, \u201coh, yeah", "we did do a fun thing there and it\u2019s not all tantrums and\u2026\u201d \u201ctantrums and debates over mexican food?\u201d a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "what else have you continued to do from drop dead healthy", "a.j", "jacobs: i still do love treadmill desks", "i made my own \u2013 i didn\u2019t buy the fancy one \u2013 but i do find it energizing", "and i only walk one and a half, two miles per hour when i\u2019m writing or answering emails but i find, if i\u2019m sitting in front of a computer, i\u2019m tempted to just rest my head on the space bar and fall asleep so you can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re on a treadmill", "so, i do like that", "and i also still like the competition", "some people are not motivated by this, but i am \u2013 getting friends and making sure that i get to 10,000 steps or my friends can mock me that they can see", "there\u2019s a leader board and that they can\u2026 what do you use for that right now in terms of sharing that with them", "a.j", "jacobs: i have been using\u2026 i hooked up my fitbit to my apple health", "it was complicated and it took\u2026 it took a while to figure out", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "so, i\u2019m\u2026 how do you encourage your friends to mock you if you don\u2019t get 10,000", "or are they the type of friends that don\u2019t need much instruction in the mocking department", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, i\u2019m trying to think", "i used to\u2026 it\u2019s been a while but this great writer who wrote the henrietta lacks book \u2013 do you remember", "oh, right", "sure", "a.j", "jacobs: anyway, she is great and also very\u2026 so, i think you just got to find the people who \u2013 [crosstalk] are most adept at mockery", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: are most adept at mockery", "i am motivated by mockery", "some people are not", "so, there\u2019s a story that i\u2019ve told quite a bit because i think that it\u2019s very practical in a lot of ways and that there are variations of this but i\u2019d like you to tell, probably, the more accurate version because i feel like i get details of this wrong when i retell it: blackmailing yourself", "a.j", "jacobs: yes", "i was so on it", "i was \u2013 [crosstalk] let\u2019s talk about the kkk", "a.j", "jacobs: alright", "let\u2019s talk about the kkk, which i do not support, just to get that out there right up front", "but i was watching many of your talks and, in a couple of them, you mentioned that \u2013 very flattering, thank you \u2013 this is an idea by that same yale professor and his idea was that, if you want to quit something or you want to stop doing a terrible behavior, then you can blackmail yourself", "is this the same yale professor who ended up later, or currently, being involved with stickkk.com", "a.j", "jacobs: yes, actually, that\u2019s right", "stickkk.com, where this is built into sort of the mechanics of how the site works", "a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "this is where you choose the anti-charity", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: this is the anti-charity, sort of \u2013 [crosstalk] in this case, you took it to the next level", "a.j", "jacobs: well, i was \u2013 excuse me \u2013 doing the health book and i was eating all of these dried mangos because they sort of have the veneer of health because they\u2019re fruit but, really, they\u2019re just sugar \u2013 they\u2019re just so much sugar", "so, i knew i had to quit so i arranged it\u2026 i said to my wife, \u201cif i eat another dried mango, then i am instructing you now \u2013 you have to do this \u2013 you have to send a $100.00 check to the kkk.\u201d and it was so effective it was crazy because just the thought of that check going out made me physically ill and i was able to quit cold turkey", "and he talks about people smoking who use this strategy and\u2026 yeah, have you ever tried it", "i have tried the anti-charity", "and it\u2019s incredible \u2013 i\u2019ve also done this with betting because i think that, for instance, if you have a betting pool of five people who have a certain goal \u2013 let\u2019s just say that\u2019s body recomposition", "so, they\u2019re each getting \u2013 this is actually a real example from a friend of mine who recently lost 40 or 50 pounds \u2013 they\u2019re each getting dexa scans \u2013 so these scans that will indicate bodyfat percentage, and muscle mass \u2013 and so on every, let\u2019s just call it every two weeks or something like that which is, actually, surprisingly inexpensive", "it\u2019s $30.00, $40.00", "and whoever has the most successful recomposition of their body by the end would get the pot and each person, i think, was putting in $100.00 and so it was a $500.00 total but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s the $500.00 that gets people to lose the weight or, in this case, lose fat", "i think that it is two things: the social mockery, and grab-assing, and ball-busting \u2013 in this case, it\u2019s five guys \u2013 and it is the losing of $100.00 \u2013 it\u2019s the loss aversion, i think, more than the prospect of gaining", "a.j", "jacobs: interesting", "so, this is one of the many issues that i suppose i take with the \u201c43rd place gets a gold star,\u201d \u201ceveryone\u2019s a winner,\u201d \u201cwe should only focus on positive reinforcement,\u201d sort of fetishizing of the patting on the head, in the us at least, where i think the stick instead of the carrot \u2013 and the shame and the humiliation \u2013 and all of these things that are thought of as negative are actually really, really useful tools if you recognize how ingrained they are as incentives in human beings", "just \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "i find it very useful", "you\u2019ve got to be careful not to crush someone\u2019s ego so they curl up in a fetal position", "right", "a.j", "jacobs: so, it\u2019s a fine line but good natured sticks, i think \u2013 like soft maybe nerf sticks, i think \u2013 are incredibly helpful", "so, this is one that i may have read about but it didn\u2019t ring a bell \u2013 a trip to jerry falwell\u2019s church", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, yes", "well, this is when i was writing the bible and i sent you this in the context of just the joy of being a mentor", "and i can say this because this guy \u2013 my mentee, my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2013 has far surpassed me in success", "his name is kevin roose and he was a writer for the new york times and the new york magazine", "now he\u2019s at fusion and he\u2019s written a couple of great books", "but i met him because i was writing my book on the bible and he was a freshman at my alma mater, brown university, and he wrote me a very funny letter saying he wanted to be a writer", "so, immediately, that\u2019s a good lesson: just the chutzpah", "i call it \u201cstrategic chutzpah\u201d \u2013 just writing out of the blue", "instead of going through alumni relations, he just wrote me out of the blue, \u201ci want to be a writer", "i\u2019ll work for you for free while i learn about it", "[crosstalk] i don\u2019t remember this part", "a.j", "jacobs: so, that, i was already impressed", "and, at the time, i was trying to follow all the rules of the bible and the bible actually, in the old testament, slavery is fine", "so, i was really struggling with, \u201chow do i deal with that in my life?\u201d because, obviously, slavery is not so fine and not so legal, thank god", "so, i said, \u201cthe closest thing to slavery in my life is an internship so, if you can come and be my intern and let me call you my biblical slave, then let\u2019s do it.\u201d so, he\u2019s like, \u201ci\u2019m in.\u201d and he was great and so proactive and then, as a thank you, i took him on one of the trips i made for that book where i was going around and trying to see how different people interpreted the bible literally", "and i took him to jerry falwell\u2019s church and he was fascinated", "he was like, \u201cthis is amazing", "this is like an alternate universe", "i live in a bubble", "i want to\u2026 what if i transferred from brown, the most liberal college in the united states, to liberty college which is one of the most conservative?\u201d where you can\u2019t watch an \u2018r\u2019 rated movie", "you\u2019d get in trouble for it", "holding hands with someone of the opposite sex is like\u2026 that\u2019s \u2013 [crosstalk] forboden", "a.j", "jacobs: forboden", "so, i was like, \u201cthat\u2019s an interesting idea", "yeah.\u201d and i encouraged him to write a proposal, and i helped him a bit, and hooked him up with an agent, and he did it", "and he went and got the book contract, wrote a great book \u2013 which is great not just because it\u2019s interesting but because it\u2019s very nuanced \u2013 and he shows that these are people and there are benefits to this way of life and so he didn\u2019t villainize them", "and, anyway, i thought that that was fantastic", "so, just this idea of being a mentor gives so much pleasure, i think", "in one way, it\u2019s a waste of time but, in another way, it\u2019s just\u2026 and it\u2019s also, from a very practical point of view, it\u2019s paid off", "now he\u2019s so much smarter than me and more connected with the internet that he can help me", "what, if we look at your toolkit and set of rules\u2026", "you have done a lot of experiments for many, many different things", "if you were trying to give someone who is, say, about to get married recommendations for marriage and parenting", "if you had to be, not somber, but as serious as possible, what would the real advice be", "a.j", "jacobs: well, a couple of things come to mind", "one is the clich\u00e9, \u201cdon\u2019t go to bed angry\u201d", "i fully disagree with that", "i go to bed angry all the time and i find it so helpful because my wife gets cranky at night", "if i tried to argue it out with her, she would be furious and neither of us would get sleep and it would be a disaster", "you go to sleep, you wake up the morning, and you have a fresh perspective and you can talk about it rationally", "and i do that with my kids, too", "we start to get in an argument and i say, \u201cyou know what", "let\u2019s cool down and let\u2019s think about this", "i\u2019m not forgetting about this argument but let\u2019s reconvene in a few hours.\u201d so, actually, i do like that \u2013 so, do go to bed angry is my first suggestion", "another one is from my wife\u2019s stepdad who died recently, but, when we were getting married \u2013 i thought it was very good advice \u2013 he said, \u201cyou\u2019re both going to think that you\u2019re doing 70 percent of the work in the marriage and you\u2019re both wrong", "so, just be aware of how much the other person is doing and you\u2019re taking for granted.\u201d and, for one of my experiments \u2013 the one i said where i tried to be the best husband \u2013 one of the things we did was we wrote a list of everything she does in our lives around the house and everything i do", "i honestly thought it was going to be about 50/50 and it was 80 her and 20 me so it was a very humbling experience", "it was, in one sense, terrible because now she realizes, too, how little i did so it\u2019s made my life worse in one sense but it also was very revelatory and i got to see\u2026 like the little liquid soap thing, i just figured they refilled themselves \u2013 it was like a self-cleaning oven or something \u2013 but i was like, \u201coh, yeah", "someone has to do that.\u201d so, be aware of how much the other person is doing, even if you don\u2019t see it", "it\u2019s whatever bias it is \u2013 you\u2019re not seeing it so you\u2019re not aware of it", "can i just pop that back at you and ask you what you would suggest to someone going into a relationship", "i think this is probably above my paygrade being that i\u2019ve not yet decided how i feel about marriage or gained much clarity related to marriage", "but i think i would give the advice that amanda palmer, the musician, received from a mentor of hers: \u201cfor any type of conflict resolution, say less.\u201d i think that would be the starting point \u2013 \u201cjust say less.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: i like that", "because my inclination \u2013 and i think that much of my family is this way, certainly my brother is this way \u2013 the desire to be right sometimes overrides the pragmatic road to being effective", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "my brother and i can both get righteously indignant and that does not help with conflict resolution, it turns out", "so, i would say, \u201csay less.\u201d i\u2019ve become better that that", "a.j", "jacobs: i love that", "there are a couple of things that come to mind, phrases", "like i\u2019ve heard, \u201cyou can be right or you can be married but not both,\u201d which i think is a good one", "and then i asked some 80-year-old guy who had been married for 50 years what his secret is and he said, \u201ctooth marks on the tongue \u2013 that\u2019s the secret to a happy marriage", "just bite your tongue", "bite it, bite it, bite it.\u201d that\u2019s funny", "there\u2019s some funny bits of advice that i\u2019ve heard thrown around", "i\u2019m not saying this is the advice i would give but i also talked to a friend whose soon to be, who was it, it was not his direct father-in-law but he was about to get married", "literally, the day of the wedding and i think it was the grandfather from the old country \u2013 from poland or something \u2013 grabbed him and he\u2019s like, \u201clet\u2019s go take a walk.\u201d he took him for a walk and he said, \u201cthis is all you need to know.\u201d he goes, \u201conly professionals, only on the road.\u201d and so i\u2019ll let people figure that out for themselves", "but, yeah, some crazy relationship advice out there", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: very crazy", "other advice i would give would be know what you need to work on and, ideally, find someone who\u2019s really good at what you need to work on because i do think, at least for me, there\u2019s a complementary polarity that needs to exist for a relationship to have any longevity", "and it\u2019s a complementary set of skills but those could overlap very much with attributes \u2013 just god-given or nature-given predispositions", "and then something that i don\u2019t know if i\u2019ve ever written about but i\u2019ve noticed for a lot of relationships \u2013 and this goes for hetero-normative, or homosexual, it goes for anything sexual as far as i can tell, at least in many cases \u2013 that, if you were to imagine a sliding scale and you have 100 percent \u2013 and this is going to get people up in a tizzy no matter how i phrase it so i\u2019m going to try to state it simply \u2013 100 percent what we would consider feminine attributes on one end of the scale and then 100 percent masculine attributes at the other end of the scale, and then, in the middle, you have perfect androgyny \u2013 just a complete perfect androgyny in all respects \u2013 a.j", "jacobs: right", "\u2013 physical, mental, emotional, and otherwise \u2013 that, wherever you are on the slider, you will be most attracted to and have the most longevity \u2013 well, actually, i should not say longevity \u2013 you\u2019ll be most attracted to, and perhaps most compatible with, someone who is the opposite", "so, if you are, say, 70 percent male attributes or masculine attributes, 30 percent feminine attributes, then you will be most attracted to someone who\u2019s 70 percent feminine attributes, 30 percent masculine attributes", "and that that sort of equal polarity from the center \u2013 50/50 perfect androgyny \u2013 seems to work pretty well and that, when you find someone who generally \u2013 and this is just very abstract speculation on my part but it seems to be the case \u2013 when you see people who, say, overlap too much on one side of that spectrum, it very rarely works from what i\u2019ve observe \u2013 very, very rarely", "so, that\u2019s not so much advice but maybe a conceptual framework for thinking about\u2026 a.j", "jacobs: yeah, that\u2019s interesting", "i was trying to apply it to my own marriage to see if i lined up and i think, actually, 70/30 is about where i am", "yeah", "a.j", "jacobs: maybe 65/35 \u2013 i don\u2019t know, different people would say lower", "and so those are some of my passing thoughts but working on it", "yeah, this is something i\u2019m working on a lot", "i\u2019m hoping to have a number of people on the podcast to discuss these types of questions \u2013 esther perel would be one and there are a handful of others", "a.j", "jacobs: have you had dan savage on the show", "[crosstalk] i haven\u2019t", "he would be another mind to pick on this", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "and he\u2019s been recommended by quite a few listeners of mine as well", "so, i was chatting with a friend of mine \u2013 and i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve spent any time with neil strauss before", "a.j", "jacobs: i have", "i love that guy", "[crosstalk] alright", "so, neil, eight time new york times best selling author, he\u2019s one of those guys who never gets writer\u2019s block who makes me crazy but he wrote a piece recently \u2013 i think it was for rolling stone \u2013 and it\u2019s something like \u201cthe age of fear.\u201d but the point \u2013 i might be getting the headline wrong but \u2013 the basic premise was we\u2019ve never lived in safer times and yet everyone is more fearful than they\u2019ve ever been", "so, for a while, you wrote a column for, i guess it was, mental floss", "a.j", "jacobs: yes", "can i just say one thing about neil strauss that i love", "yes", "a.j", "jacobs: it\u2019s that he is so generous with his ideas and this is something i\u2019ve come around to", "he gave me two or three book ideas \u2013 i never pursued them, but they\u2019re good book ideas", "like he had one where he said, \u201cyou should just\u2026\u201d \u2013 you know what, it\u2019s kind of similar to your podcast \u2013 \u201cyou should find the best \u2013 the michael jordan of everything \u2013 and learn their secrets, and then write a book.\u201d it\u2019s kind of tools for titans", "it\u2019s kind of exactly what i did, yeah", "a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s hilarious", "i didn\u2019t realize that", "but i love the idea of being generous with your ideas because, when i first started my career, i was so paranoid, i wouldn\u2019t\u2026 people would say, \u201coh, what are you working on?\u201d \u201coh, i can\u2019t tell you,\u201d even though it was probably some lame thing that no one\u2019s going to steal and, if they did steal it, so what \u2013 it\u2019s all about execution", "so, this is a crazy story", "i\u2019m much older than you so, when i very first started \u2013 when i got out of college \u2013 there were still libraries and that\u2019s where you would go to research things", "and i was doing joke book on the eerie similarities between jesus and elvis because elvis had said that he believed he was the second coming", "and i was so paranoid that i went to two different libraries \u2013 so i went to one to get books about elvis and one to get gooks about \u2013 [crosstalk] you didn\u2019t want anyone to put two and two together", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "isn\u2019t that insane \u2013 the level of delusion there", "who cares", "and now, i feel, telling people my ideas, that the positives outweigh the negatives \u2013 that you meet people who are interesting that can help you or expand the idea", "i don\u2019t know if you know adam mansbach who wrote go, the\u2026 i don\u2019t know, are you allowed \u2013 do you want the \u201cbleep\u201d on this or no", "go the f to sleep", "oh, no", "oh, yeah, absolutely", "yeah, we have lots of cursing on this show", "it\u2019s deliberately not falwell-compliant", "so, yes, go the fuck to sleep", "brilliant", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "and he \u2013 [crosstalk] brilliant", "brilliant", "which became a huge bestseller because it got leaked, as far as i can tell, as a pdf among people in the publishing world", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, that\u2019s so interesting", "that\u2019s a part of how it became a huge best seller", "a.j", "jacobs: well, that\u2019s similar to\u2026 because he had put it up as a facebook update as a joke \u2013 like he said, \u201ci\u2019m going to write a book called go the f to sleep \u2013 and people are like, \u201cyou should do that.\u201d so, the idea of sharing and being out there with your ideas, that\u2019s been a big change in my career", "so, just to touch on that because i think it\u2019s really important idea, neil strauss does this", "although, when he is working on something, he is tremendously paranoid about it", "a.j", "jacobs: interesting", "when he\u2019s already committed to writing something \u2013 i\u2019ve known neil forever \u2013 and he still will not\u2026 he\u2019s afraid of letting out the meme", "but i do think these are two different things \u2013 once you\u2019ve fully committed to doing something and when you\u2019re testing the water, i think, are two distinct phases", "but i remember when i was proofreading his book, emergency, no, 1, the only reason he let me write about it \u2013 or, rather, read it \u2013 was because he wouldn\u2019t tell me what he was writing about \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t tell me, he wouldn\u2019t tell me \u2013 and i just threw out this hail mary and i said, \u201cwhat is this", "some five flags stuff?\u201d \u2013 which is very insider terminology for all sorts of prepper survivalist multiple passport communities", "and his eyes got about the size of a dinner plate and he said, \u201cwhat have you heard", "what have you heard?\u201d and then he would give me, printed out, 15 to 20 pages at a time to proofread and then i would have to give those back before i could have the next set", "a.j", "jacobs: i love it", "were they color-coded", "they were not color coded, although, knowing neil, i\u2019m sure there are some type of identification numbers on them", "but he is very generous with is ideas until he decides where he\u2019s going to go all out", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "and kevin rose, very close friend of mine, serial entrepreneur, extremely successful investor, does the same thing", "and kevin kelly, founding editor of wired, one of my favorite people out there \u2013 i think he\u2019s probably the real-world most interesting man in the world, a technology futurist who spends time with the amish almost every year to determine how they accept and vet technology, fascinating guy \u2013 he also tries to give away or kill as many of his ideas as possible", "and, if he can\u2019t give them away, he can\u2019t kill him, and they stick with him and him alone, then those are the ideas he considers pursuing", "a.j", "jacobs: interesting", "[crosstalk] so, in a way, giving ideas away is one of his filters \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: right", "\u2013 to determine what he should work on because he is a man of a lot of ideas", "he may have 20 different project ideas", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "and, the ones he can\u2019t give away, when that group overlaps with \u2013 or, i should say, rather, when you combine the ones that he can\u2019t give way with the ones that he can\u2019t kill \u2013 because he can\u2019t find flaws in them, some fatal flaw \u2013 those are the ones that he ends up pursuing", "a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s so interesting", "i love that", "yeah", "but we were talking about, earlier on, being grateful for the little things", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "and then neil came up because he wrote this rolling stone piece on \u201cthe age of fear\u201d and how everyone\u2019s terrified \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: right", "[crosstalk] \u2013 and think the world\u2019s going to hell in a handbasket in every possible respect but, objectively, things seem pretty good", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, yeah", "and i totally believe that and there\u2019s that great steven pinker book, the better angels of our nature, which traces the history of violence and how we are in the safest time ever even with the horrors of the 20th century wars", "and, yeah, there was a great magazine called mental floss \u2013 which just folded a month ago, but they still have a web presence \u2013 and i wrote a monthly column", "i can\u2019t remember\u2026 i wanted to call it \u201cthe good old days sucked\u201d but i don\u2019t think it ended up being called that", "but the premise was we have this nostalgia \u2013 [crosstalk] wait, modern problems", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, yeah", "exactly", "modern problems", "there we go", "a.j", "jacobs: you are\u2026 see, you\u2019re better than me", "i just happened to read your wikipedia more recently, i think, than you", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, so the idea was, every month, i would take a different topic and show how horrible life used to be and how grateful we should be", "not all of us \u2013 there are still people in other countries and even in our country living in horrible conditions \u2013 but, if you\u2019re lucky enough, we live in, by far, the best times and there\u2019s so many examples", "the first one, i think, was on medicine and the one i talked about in the first paragraph, i believe, was the smoke enema, the tobacco enema, which is\u2026 you know the phrase \u201cblow smoke up your ass?\u201d yeah", "a.j", "jacobs: that was a literal thing", "it came because they would have a hose and a pump and they would shoot tobacco up your butt because they believed that it was good for your stomach and good for your health", "okay", "this might explain something that i\u2019ve been trying to figure out for a few years now", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: i\u2019m intrigued", "what\u2019s your point", "[crosstalk] a friend of mine sent me a photograph of the menu of a whorehouse in the early 1800\u2019s and it was like, blow job, $2.00, whatever, this type of sex, $3.00, this type of sex, $1.00, and then it had \u201csmoke up the ass,\u201d $30.00", "a.j", "jacobs: wow", "and i was like, \u201cwait a second", "i want to know what the smoke up the ass is about.\u201d i was very curious because i was like, \u201cwhat was the\u2026\u201d but maybe this was actually the medicinal option on the menu", "a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "it was like\u2026 that is fascinating", "how did something so highly prized come to be associated with deceitful flattery \u2013 blowing smoke up your ass", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, that is\u2026 it\u2019s a weird segway", "i don\u2019t know what to make of that", "alright, so the tobacco enema, back in the day", "just be glad\u2026", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: so, yeah", "i\u2019m sure you can still find it", "i\u2019m sure it\u2019s somewhere out there if you google it", "oh, you

he\u2019s one of these group of people \u2013 they\u2019re researchers, and scientists, and geneticists \u2013 who are building a family tree, the biggest family tree ever, the biggest possible family

it\u2019s crazy", "as i say, there\u2019s two ways you do it: with dna but one way is one the internet, almost a wikipedia-like model where thousands, millions of people are working on the same big family tree", "so, i\u2019m on this tree which now has 100 million people", "and one of the fun things that will take up a week of your life is you can figure out how you\u2019re related to almost anyone else", "like barack obama, for instance \u2013 this is true \u2013 is my fifth great aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife\u2019s seventh great nephew", "so, we\u2019re pretty close",

\u201cthe tim ferriss show.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "this is a tool, for i believe, for titans or non-titans", "but it is like the greatest social network ever \u2013 it\u2019s like linkedin on steroids \u2013 because i threw an event trying to hold the biggest family reunion ever and i needed publicity so i would find a reporter or a tv producer, i would figure out how i was related to them, i would sent them an email and say, \u201clisten, this may sound weird but you are my seventh cousin three times removed\u2019s husband\u2019s son so we\u2019re family", "would you do a favor for a cousin and write about my project?\u201d and i\u2019d say, maybe, 20 percent of the time, they were freaked out and like, \u201cstop stalking me,\u201d but, 80 percent of the time, they were intrigued", "they were like, \u201creally", "we\u2019re cousins", "oh, that\u2019s so interesting,\u201d and i got more publicity that way than anything", "what was the subject line", "do you remember what the subject line would have been", "a.j", "jacobs: i think it was\u2026 \u201cfrom a.j., your relative\u201d", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, \u201cfrom a.j., your distant cousin.\u201d for my book about it, i wanted to interview george h.w", "bush because he\u2019s got this huge family so i emailed his chief of staff and was like\u2026 and she said, \u201coh, he\u2019s not doing interviews.\u201d and i said, \u201cwell, but i am a cousin,\u201d and she\u2019s like, \u201coh, well, you\u2019re a cousin", "i guess we can make an exception,\u201d and i was able to go down and interview him", "so, for another three years this will work and then everyone will realize, \u201coh, wait", "everyone\u2019s cousins.\u201d but i highly recommend it as a strategy for now", "you\u2019ve got to make it count while you can", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "why did you decide to do a podcast", "a.j", "jacobs: yes, i am \u2013 [crosstalk] now, a number of fans of yours and mine said they loved your audiobooks", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, that\u2019s nice", "and i need to edit this out if this is not the right anecdote but i could swear that you told me, at some point, that you went to record your audiobook and the people at the studio \u2013 god, i want to say this was you \u2013 they said, \u201cwell, you seem to have a cold so why don\u2019t you come back when you don\u2019t have a cold?\u201d is this the right story", "a.j", "jacobs: no, that\u2019s hilarious but, you know what", "it might well have been", "i don\u2019t trust my memory so i have\u2026 well, one of my friends, at least, who has gone in \u2013 if it\u2019s you or somebody else \u2013 he went in to record his audiobook and he was so excited and they went on to be hugely successful and he recorded for ten minutes and the producer in the studio was like, \u201cyou know what", "let\u2019s take a break and why don\u2019t we have you come in in a few days when your cold is over?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cno, i don\u2019t have a cold", "this is just what i sound like.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: love it", "i know", "i have an odd voice \u2013 i have an odd voice \u2013 it hasn\u2019t hindered me too much", "no, i\u2019m not saying that you have an odd voice", "i was bringing it up because i thought that it was from you but it\u2026 a.j", "jacobs: ah, well, i love it", "but i will tell you, when i recorded my audiobook, i apparently had a very active stomach and so it was growling a lot and so i had to do a lot of retakes", "and i was apologizing to the producers and they said, \u201cno, that happens with everyone,\u201d and they, in fact, had a file of all these famous authors\u2019 body sounds \u2013 like susan sontag\u2019s farts or whatever \u2013 and i was like, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to put that out", "that would be the most awesome album: \u2018famous people\u2019s bodily functions.'\u201d but i don\u2019t think they did", "anyway\u2026 so, the podcast, though", "i took us off the rail", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, the podcast, i\u2019m very excited about", "it\u2019s called \u201ctwice removed\u201d and it\u2019s sort of an interview show, mixed with hardcore history, mixed with a game show so it\u2019s an odd mix", "and the idea is we take a notable person and then we go through their family history and find the most interesting, inspirational stories and then talk about those", "and then, at the end, we introduce them to a cousin they didn\u2019t know they had so it\u2019s sort of this surprise ending", "and it could be someone like their hero, maybe, their mentor", "it could be an ex-girlfriend", "it could be anyone", "an ex-girlfriend", "a.j", "jacobs: we haven\u2019t done that yet but\u2026 current wife", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, exactly", "\u201cyou are cousins with your spouse.\u201d but, yeah, no, i\u2026 and it\u2019s being produced by gimlet, who did \u201cstartup\u201d \u2013 which i\u2019m sure, because you\u2019re friends with chris sacca\u2026 and so, yeah, \u201cstartup,\u201d which is, as you or your listeners might know, it was a podcast about starting a podcast company \u2013 very meta", "so, they are doing it and they are amazing because they\u2019re all like \u201cthis american life\u201d alums and so they are just so good at editing, and crafting the story, and music", "and i know nothing about it so it\u2019s been a fascinating learning experience", "and i\u2019m learning, also, how to tell stories in an audio way which is different", "so, i\u2019ve found it\u2019s fascinating", "we\u2019ll see how it does but i\u2019m excited for it", "yeah, they have a really good team", "alex blumberg, he\u2019s also in tools of the titans and he\u2019s really good at asking questions because he records really long tape and is good at listening to emotion and the stories, specifically, like you said, from interview subjects", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: right", "and he gives me \u2013 i\u2019m sure, since you interviewed him, you know \u2013 the silence", "he\u2019s brilliant at using the silence just waiting", "[crosstalk] oh, heck yeah", "letting the silence do the work", "yeah, he\u2019s really, really good and they\u2019ve had a whole string of really successful shows \u2013 \u201creply all,\u201d \u201cmystery show\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ve had a very, very consistent hit rate so\u2026 a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "they\u2019re the best", "[crosstalk] so, i will be certainly checking that out", "[01:28:07] a.j", "jacobs: and we actually had one that\u2019s sort of related to some of the stuff you do", "we had abby jacobson, who\u2019s on broad city\u00a0\u2013 she\u2019s a hilarious comedian \u2013 but one of her ancestors was this entrepreneur, a woman entrepreneur", "so, we had a whole segment on female entrepreneurs through history including betsy ross", "we all think of her just sewing the flag but, apparently, she had a team", "she was a titan", "[crosstalk] titan", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "huh", "a.j", "jacobs: and same with jfk\u2019s great-grandma who came over and opened a button shop and the kennedys would not have existed if she hadn\u2019t been an entrepreneur and funded her kids\u2019 education and then they, whatever, got into liquor and that spawned the political dynasty", "the gateway to all good things", "a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "so, you are, of course, going to be promoting the podcast, you\u2019ve promoted books in the past, and you\u2019ve done various types of pr and marketing", "one of the bullets that i wanted to talk about was \u2013 and this is in your voice \u2013 but, \u201chow i learned to love marketing.\u201d because a lot of authors, a lot of artists, certainly, think of marketing as sullying their hands with the dirty work of commercialism or an evil to be avoided", "so, how did you learn to\u2026", "a.j", "jacobs: well, partly inspired by tim ferriss but, partly, it was i reframed marketing", "i\u2019m trying to think of it not as the sullying my art but as something that could be creative in its own right", "and part of this was i interviewed the artist, christo \u2013 the guy who wraps islands and the gates in central park, a really interesting guy \u2013 and he was working on this one project for 24 years", "he was trying to put up these gates in central park, these curtains and arches in central park \u2013 10,000 orange arches", "and he had to deal with city bureaucracy for 24 years so i asked him, \u201cgod, that must have been so frustrating.\u201d and he said, \u201cwell, yes and no,\u201d he said, \u201ci actually see dealing with the bureaucracy as part of my art", "it\u2019s all part of one big art project so i don\u2019t separate it from the actual designing of the pieces.\u201d and i was like, \u201cthat\u2019s an interesting way to look at it.\u201d so, i try to apply that to marketing and, instead of seeing it as this horrible pain in the ass, \u201cwhat can i do that\u2019s creative with it?\u201d and one of the things, when i was doing the year of living biblically, for instance, i was like, \u201chow can i section this off so i can appeal to 50 different audiences?\u201d so i wrote a piece for a music magazine about music in the bible", "i did, for glamour magazine, i wrote sex advice in the bible \u2013 because there\u2019s a good amount of sex in the bible", "and it was actually very interesting", "i became a fan of this way of thinking as opposed to being\u2026 and the same thing with speeches \u2013 i used to hate giving speeches \u2013 but, like we said before, the whole \u201cfake it until you make it,\u201d so i forced myself to do every speech i could and, now, i just love it", "actually, i\u2019m not a fan of sitting down in front of the keyboard but i\u2019d much rather be onstage talking", "well, that\u2019s a part of the dangerous siren song of marketing", "so, when i was working on tools of titans, i used a program called scrivener to put together my books \u2013 i\u2019ve done that for the last three books \u2013 and i had a working file which was \u201cmarketing ideas.\u201d and i found it was very dangerous to have that within a stone\u2019s throw of my writing because it was always easier \u2013 or more enjoyable \u2013 for me to work on the marketing ideas and to put off the actual work of writing", "so, it had marketing ideas and i modified the file name so it was \u201cmarketing ideas \u2013 focus on writing!!!\u201d in all capital letters and three exclamation points", "a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s it", "now, if you had to rank the different parts of your job in terms of enjoyment that they give you, what would you say", "so, funny enough, this last book was the first one that i\u2019ve enjoyed writing", "i love doing what i\u2019m doing right now, which is my favorite part of writing without the writing", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "the interviewing \u2013 i love the interviewing and the researching", "i do enjoy the experimentation but those sometimes go sideways, as you and i both know, so those don\u2019t always turn out as intended or hoped", "and then, probably historically, it would have been marketing and then the writing", "but the writing was right there, i would say, if not at par with the marketing \u2013 maybe even ahead of it this time around \u2013 which was weird for me", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: and what do you think that was", "was it the topic or did you discover some hack to enjoy writing", "[crosstalk] there were a few things", "i think that, primarily, it was the enjoyment in assimilation of \u2013 this is kind of meta but \u2013 absorbing the lessons and recommendations of the people i interviewed as i was editing, and reviewing, and taking multiple passes on these chapters", "a.j", "jacobs: interesting", "so, i was actually incorporating a lot of the\u2026 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: what\u2019s an example", "do you remember one", "sure", "oh, yeah", "i ended up having a routine where, for instance, i used a barrel sauna with the exact same specs as rick rubin \u2013 who recommended it to me \u2013 and alternated that with cold exposure at specific times of the day, just like wim hof would", "and, in the mornings, i would listen to, say, a guided meditation from tara brach and, specifically, the 2010 \u201csummer smile\u201d meditation which maria popova recommended to me", "so, i started incorporating and then i would take, say, exogenous ketones \u2013 which are these powdered synthetic ketones \u2013 which dominic d\u2019agostino had recommended to me", "so, all of these bits and pieces from the actual chapters became part of my daily routine for working on the chapters which is kind of wild", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s great, yeah", "and then there\u2019s the deeper kind of philosophical stuff", "i was writing this mostly over the summer, early fall, and there were a few people in the book, like bj miller \u2013who is a palliative care physician who\u2019s helped more than 1,000 people die \u2013 and ed cooke \u2013 memory champion who taught, you might remember a book called moonwalking with einstein\u00a0\u2013 a.j", "jacobs: oh, yeah", "so, ed cook is the memory champion/coach who taught, in this case, i think it was joshua foer \u2013 those foer brothers, both amazing writers", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: three of them \u2013 there are three", "[crosstalk] three, that\u2019s right", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: there\u2019s a third one", "[crosstalk] so, to become national memory champion in the us in one year", "so, ed cooke and bj miller both use stargazing as a way to reduce anxiety and they both have particular ways that they go about it", "so, i did that every night before going to bed", "and it just went on, and on, and on so i think that the subject matter, itself, had a huge impact on the writing of the book which was unexpected, in a way", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: right", "that is, yeah", "yeah, and the marketing, at this point for me, is fun because i try to make it fun in the sense that i very often ask myself, \u201chow can i make the launch, itself, pr worthy?\u201d if that makes sense", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "and that forces me to do sometimes absurd things and, even if some of the absurd things are what i might consider, or people might consider, a waste of money, like doing billboards in new york city right now", "i have 80 plus billboards in new york city with the answers from guests to the question \u201cwhat would you put on a billboard if you could put anything on a billboard to get a message out to millions of people?\u201d so, i got all these answers and took some of my favorites and now they\u2019re on actual physical billboards all throughout new york city", "that probably doesn\u2019t sell a lot of books but it gives me such childlike joy to do something that absurd and to make guests happy, themselves, that even if it is a waste of money, it\u2019s probably not a waste of money", "meaning, in isolation, maybe it\u2019s a waste of money but, because of the infusion of enthusiasm that it\u2019s given me and the excitement it\u2019s created among many of the guests and people who ended up in the book, it\u2019s acted as fuel for a lot of other things that actually do have financial return \u2013 or at least a clear financial return", "a.j", "jacobs: i love that", "that is funny", "yeah", "so, that \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: i had a similar experience", "i\u2019m finishing my book on the family now but, as part of it, last summer, i threw the biggest worldwide family reunion ever and that was, financially, not a great idea but it was so fun and so interesting and i hope

found that extremely helpful", "so, i thought that was\u2026 and you found it really helpful and that sounded so absurd but i remember, i think it was the four-hour body, i was really stressed out about the deadline, and so i paid a virtual assistant to worry about my deadline for me", "and it was such a weird form of, not necessarily self-deception, but taking advantage of a quirk of human psychology to know that someone else was on the job", "a.j", "jacobs: yes", "i love that", "who was your virtual assistant", "was it an indian or\u2026", "[crosstalk] i hired someone, i think, from the philippines", "a.j", "jacobs: philippines", "they\u2019re good worriers, yeah", "that is awesome", "well, and i also think calling it an experiment gives you permission to fail because it\u2019s an experiment and sometimes experiments fail", "so, if you do a change in your life and say, \u201ci\u2019m experimenting with this,\u201d it makes it\u2026 and it reminds me of \u2013 i\u2019m probably going to get this wrong but \u2013 i think it was a french writer named montaigne who came up with the word \u201cessay\u201d which means \u201cto try.\u201d so, i find that so freeing \u2013 when you write something, you\u2019re just trying", "[crosstalk] yup", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: you\u2019re just trying", "it may work, it may not", "and the more \u2013 this has been true for me \u2013 the more experiments you attempt and the more you try to push the absurd in certain respects, the easier it gets because you realize the penalties are generally not that severe", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "with some of the stupid stuff that i do, they end up, physically, being pretty severe and you can get very injured", "like don\u2019t try to learn parkour in a week \u2013 it turned out to be a very bad idea for your knees", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: i remember, i saw you recently after you had done that and you were\u2026 brutal", "i was not in good shape and still have injuries from that", "but, generally, if you\u2019re doing these experiments that you think you\u2019re going to be judge very harshly for, if you\u2019re presenting them in the right way \u2013 if you feel compelled to explain them \u2013 generally, there are very few repercussions and people are actually more supportive and interested than you would expect", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "and, also, if you get something good out of it for your own life, then it\u2019s probably worth it unless you inflict massive pain on others like with radical honesty", "yes, radical honesty, that\u2019s another one i want to explore a bit", "there\u2019s a great book called lying by sam harris", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, yeah", "i read that", "i think it\u2019s a great book", "a.j", "jacobs: it\u2019s a great book", "yeah", "very complimentary to the \u201ci think you\u2019re fat\u201d essay", "so, this is from charlotte chapman \u2013 most embarrassing failure at an experiment", "so, aside from the

interesting", "yeah, i think my life has been a series of embarrassments and humiliations so\u2026 well, in a way, you engineer your experiments to be embarrassing", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s true", "yes, exactly", "because i\u2019d also think that makes better copy is\u2026 and that is actually one thing that i was thinking about that i learned doing this podcast is that being humiliated on the radio actually sometimes makes for better radio so, when i\u2019m doing interviews and i ask a question and the person is like, \u201cgod, that\u2019s a dumb question,\u201d that is beautiful", "always makes the cut", "a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s gold, yeah", "so, i may not sound that good on the podcast but i think it\u2019s entertaining so\u2026 but, yeah, i would say many humiliations", "i don\u2019t know if this counts \u2013 but this is the first one that comes to mind \u2013 i was working at esquire magazine and we asked the actress, mary-louise parker, to pose nude", "and i was tasked with asking her", "and she said, \u201cwell, i will pose nude but only if the editor of the piece also poses nude,\u201d and i was the editor", "so, i went to my editor-in-chief and he was like, \u201calright", "do it", "take off your pants", "that\u2019s your job.\u201d so, i had to pose nude for a very well-known celebrity photographer and it was quite humiliating, and vulnerable, and also highly insulting because he\u2019s a big photographer so he had ten assistants \u2013 gorgeous, 20-something female assistants \u2013 and i was like, \u201coh my god, this is so embarrassing,\u201d but they could not care less", "they were like\u2026 no interest in my nude form so that was tough for my ego", "and then it came out and they actually published the picture and we got some subscription cancellations, i believe", "so, overall, it was a dark time", "alright", "let\u2019s do some rapid-fire questions which may, in fact, be misnamed but

well, this is a little schmaltzy of an answer but i would say my dad", "he is a lawyer who loves his job", "he literally has no hobbies because all he loves is spending time with his family and his job", "so, if you can derive that much pleasure from your job, i think that\u2019s a success", "to me, there are two criteria for success: one is that you\u2019re happy and the other is that you\u2019re making the world a better place and i think he does both", "and, also, he is definitely, in our genre, taking things to the ridiculous extreme, he writes law books and he holds the world record for the most number of footnotes is a law article \u2013 4,280", "yeah", "oh my god", "a.j", "jacobs: so, yeah", "so, he finds something and he just goes with it", "wow", "the apple does not fall too far from the tree on that one", "i don\u2019t ask this with everyone but i\u2019ll ask this with you \u2013 what is something you believe that other people think is insane or that very few people would agree with you on", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, i love this question and there are many, many things so let me just go over a couple of them quickly without trying to alienate too many of your listeners", "oh, no", "alienate away", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "they\u2019re tough", "a.j", "jacobs: alright", "one is cannibalism", "i\u2019m \u2013 [crosstalk] wait, what about it", "you\u2019re a proponent", "a.j", "jacobs: i am a proponent of ethical cannibalism", "okay", "a.j", "jacobs: i\u2019m very interested and excited about in vitro meat, lab-grown meat \u2013 like you take a little cell from a chicken and grow a chicken breast or\u2026 so, i\u2019m very excited about that and i think, in 10 or 20 years, it\u2019s going to be reality and it\u2019s going to open up\u2026 you don\u2019t have to just eat cows or chickens", "you could \u2013 [crosstalk] you could have a human burger", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, a human burger", "well, i was thinking a giraffe or endangered

celebrity meat", "so, you can\u2026 eat a brad pitt burger", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "or eat a clooney burger, or eat a j", "lo burger", "and it can even be specific body parts like\u2026 that\u2019s a little creepy but\u2026 i wonder what will end up being the kobe beef of humans", "so, if you can choose gender, race, and so on, where do we end up", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "right", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, that\u2019s interesting", "i don\u2019t know", "a.j", "jacobs: i don\u2019t know so that\u2019s what \u2013 [crosstalk] all these questions just begging to be answered", "so, cannibalism, okay", "that\u2019s one", "a.j", "jacobs: another one", "like sam harris, i don\u2019t believe in free will which i think is\u2026 some people see that as depressing but i actually find it liberating because it\u2019s so much easier to forgive yourself for doing stupid things if you realize that you really didn\u2019t have\u2026 there was no other \u2013 the die has been cast", "a.j", "jacobs: the die has been cast", "and i think you\u2019re more forgiving of other people and the stupid thing you do", "now, conversely, though, couldn\u2019t you also be more forgiving or accepting of things that should not be condoned", "or is that just coming back to the lack of free will and you\u2019re sort of\u2026", "a.j", "jacobs: well, my feeling is there is a difference between fatalism and determinism", "so, you can believe that you don\u2019t have free will but, of course, our decisions make a difference", "if i just, for the rest of the month, just lay here on this couch, my life would fall apart", "i realize that", "so, i\u2019m not saying\u2026 our decisions make a difference \u2013 it\u2019s just those decisions are pre-determined", "that\u2019s a big subject", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, and i did have\u2026 wait, what was the other one that i did want to bring up", "shoot", "well, it\u2019ll come back to me", "we can come back to it", "what \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: oh", "one last one", "[crosstalk] yeah", "shoot", "a.j", "jacobs: which is multiverses", "i know a lot of physicists believe in multiverses but it really hit me with this election cycle because it is so\u2026 i can see, at the convention of universes \u2013 of the multiverses \u2013 and our universe is going to be getting just a ton of crap like, \u201cguys, this is the universe where donald trump is president", "can you believe that?\u201d and we\u2019d be like \u2013 [crosstalk] so, if the multiverse is actually a collection of kids in school and you\u2019re saying that we\u2019re going to be taunted", "a.j", "jacobs: i think so", "i do believe that", "okay", "a.j", "jacobs: so, yeah, that\u2019s what i\u2019ve been thinking about recently", "what book or books have you gifted the most to other people besides your own", "a.j", "jacobs: i would say \u2013 i can\u2019t remember if you had him on or not as a guest but \u2013 jonathan haidt", "i have not had him on as a guest", "a.j", "jacobs: he is a great writer", "how do you spell his last name", "a.j", "jacobs: h-a-i-d-t", "and i may be confusing him with \u2013 [crosstalk] he\u2019s come up a couple times in conversation with friends recently", "a.j", "jacobs: the guy did a great ted talk and he wrote a book called the righteous mind and it\u2019s all about trying to figure out the gap between the red and blue states \u2013 republican and democrat \u2013 and it\u2019s really interesting", "and he likens it to almost taste buds, like republicans have different moral taste buds than democrats and\u2026 i think the righteous mind may have been recommended to me by a neuroscientist about a year ago \u2013 a ph.d", "in neuroscience", "so, the righteous mind", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "what purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in recent memory", "a.j", "jacobs: that is a good question", "well, one thing i do love is my elastic shoelaces", "do you use those", "no", "i like this idea, though", "i was just fussing with shoelaces yesterday and got so fed up that i went and found a different pair of shoes that i had packed which do not have shoelaces", "so, elastic shoelaces", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "so, you just replace the cloth shoelaces with these elastic\u2026 i think it\u2019s called \u201clace lock\u201d is the brand i use", "and, yeah, shoelaces seem like such 18th century technology", "it\u2019s so crazy we still use them and, these ones, you just slip them on and they, for me at least, they\u2019re just as tight and secure", "they\u2019re also not as mental institution as velcro shoes", "a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "[crosstalk] you don\u2019t have to make the jump to velcro", "you can go in between with these", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "yeah, velcro, if you\u2019re under 7 or over 80, you can get away with velcro but, in between, it\u2019s hard", "do you have any particular morning rituals", "anything that is particularly important to you that is not obvious", "like, yes, you want to keep your kids alive and i\u2019m imagining feed them in some form and fashion, but are there any other morning routines or rituals that are important to you", "a.j", "jacobs: well, one we talked about is sort of the mental calisthenics", "i find that helpful", "another you talked about in your books which is the restricting information \u2013 information diets \u2013 and i have tried, sometimes successfully, to stop reading the newspaper or any news in the morning because then i just get depressed and spiral", "i find it good to read news right before i go to bed because then i get depressed and i\u2019m able to fall asleep", "so, that, for me \u2013 keeping your mind clear away from news in the morning \u2013 is crucial", "if you were to give a ted talk on something you are not known for \u2013 so you\u2019ve given a lot of talks but something you are not associated with or known for whatsoever \u2013 what would it be on", "a.j", "jacobs: oh, that\u2019s a good one", "that\u2019s a good one", "let me think", "i don\u2019t know, this might be repetitive but talking about all the ways that the past is horrible", "i think that i could go on for\u2026 i know you only have 20 minutes over a ted talk but i could go on for four hours", "is there anything you obsess on, or over, or on the evenings or weekends", "so, something, a pet obsession of yours, that you\u2019ve not talked about", "a.j", "jacobs: let\u2019s see", "yes, i\u2019m sure", "i\u2019m slightly obsessive person, as are you", "so, yeah \u2013 [crosstalk] slightly is very generous, in my case, at least", "a.j", "jacobs: i\u2019m trying to think", "i would say, i guess, that i do have the fear of missing out \u2013 not on parties but on ideas", "i\u2019m always nervous that i haven\u2019t read enough and that there\u2019s great ideas and i\u2019m just woefully ignorant so that\u2019s, i guess, something", "and then you read the newspaper before you go to bed and get depressed and, voila", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: exactly", "that\u2019s it", "if you think about bad advice, what is some bad advice that you hear given out often in your world", "and you can define that any way you want \u2013 it could be writing, it could be\u2026 a.j", "jacobs: i do have one", "i have one that\u2019s a pet peeve of mine which is, \u201cbe yourself,\u201d because what if yourself is an asshole", "like, stalin, he was being himself", "\u201clet stalin be stalin.\u201d that guy was really being himself", "so, i think, if you think about this a little more \u2013 a little less flippantly \u2013 i think there are things that are very deep enough \u2013 if you\u2019re gay, you\u2019re gay, don\u2019t try to change that \u2013 but there are aspects of our personality that we think are ingrained but that can be changed", "like i don\u2019t think i\u2019m a very outgoing person naturally \u2013 i think i would spend most days just indoors reading \u2013 but i force myself to be social and sort of force myself to get out there, and it\u2019s made my life better because you interact with people and you\u2019re happier", "so, don\u2019t just be yourself", "try to be the best parts of yourself but then take the worst parts of yourself and try to change those", "mm-hmm", "a.j", "jacobs: which i think you do, right", "no, i agree with that", "i agree with that advice and i think there\u2019s also, \u201cbe yourself,\u201d implies that you\u2019re a finished product, in a sense, too", "right", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "which is where i take issue with the obsession with, \u201cdiscover yourself,\u201d where, maybe, as a complement to that, at least \u2013 maybe even an alternative \u2013 \u201ccreate yourself,\u201d may be, in some ways is more accurate", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "even though we think of this persistent \u201ci\u201d \u2013 this persistent tim, this persistent a.j", "\u2013 from the cells in our body to just about every other aspect of our being, we are constantly in flux", "a.j", "jacobs: yup", "i love that", "works in progress", "so, i may not have time to put this up in the next few weeks but, if you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere to get a message out to millions of people \u2013 that could not be an advertisement \u2013 any short message", "a.j", "jacobs: i was thinking about this because i know you ask it", "one thought that occurred to me is something like, \u201clife is too complicated, and subtle, and filled with grays to be summed up on a billboard so don\u2019t pay attention to billboards,\u201d \u2013 something meta like that", "i did a piece on effective altruism", "i know you interviewed \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah", "will macaskill", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "and i am a fan of that way of thinking just how lucky we are and trying to give back so maybe\u2026 is that\u2026", "if you \u2013 [crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: but that would be an advertisement", "no, not necessarily", "you could have, \u201cif you make more than $68k per year, you\u2019re in the global 1 percent.\u201d a.j", "jacobs: yeah, something like that", "it\u2019s interesting because you got to use guilt very\u2026 guilt will only get you so far", "yeah", "a.j", "jacobs: that might get you in the door but then this feeling of empowerment of helping others, i think, is a better motivator for altruism", "yeah", "well, i think it\u2019s more, if you\u2019re looking to optimize the lifetime value of a donor as opposed to a single transaction that they then resent, then, yeah, guilt is not the primary tool", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: right", "at least it seems that way, just working with a number of non-profits myself, mostly, and educational stuff", "so, i sometimes ask people what advice they would give their younger self", "i\u2019m going to pose it a different way because you have this aged photo of yourself \u2013 your 82-year-old self \u2013 in your house", "what advice do you think your 82-year-old self would give your current self", "a.j", "jacobs: that is a good one", "i like that twist", "i think \u2013 and i try to do this \u2013 i think my 82-year-old self, hopefully, will be wiser and happier", "i do think, overall, my level of happiness has risen which is nice", "so, hopefully \u2013 [crosstalk] trending in the right direction", "a.j", "jacobs: so, hopefully \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 that continues", "and i guess i battle this, even today, is, \u201cdon\u2019t be so opinionated", "don\u2019t have such strongly held beliefs that they can\u2019t be changed with evidence.\u201d i think that this society has a weird fetish with strongly held beliefs like, \u201cthese are my deep seeded beliefs and, if you change them, you\u2019re a flip-flopper.\u201d and i think we\u2019ve got to rebrand \u2013 flip-flopping is great as long as you\u2019re doing it based on evidence and not on whims", "you have the ability to and the courage to change your convictions \u2013 not just the courage of your convictions but the courage to change them", "so, maybe, i would tell myself, \u201cwork on that part of your personality.\u201d that\u2019s what makes a good scientist as well, right", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, exactly", "right", "what is one of your favorite personal failures", "and what i mean by that is, specifically, a failure that led, in some way, to a later success or set the stage for a later success", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: right", "well, i have had many, many failures as we\u2019ve discussed and i am a big fan of them", "and rejection \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things i try to teach my kids all the time like, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get rejected 98 percent of the time", "you\u2019ve just got to keep going.\u201d i don\u2019t know if this falls into the right category but nbc, a couple of years ago, optioned my life \u2013 one of my books \u2013 and it was going to be a comedy where, every week, it was this writer did another wacky experiment and chaos ensued", "and it was a total failure \u2013 it didn\u2019t get picked up \u2013 but the lesson i learned was i actually made a conscious effort\u2026 i was like, \u201cyou know what", "this may or may not get picked up but i am going to consciously enjoy this experience and get everything i can out of it.\u201d i got to mean donald sutherland who played my father-in-law", "my wife was played by this woman who had much bigger boobs than she did so she loved it", "and it was just a blast", "and i would go into meetings and i would be like, \u201cwhat if the main character,\u201d \u2013 who was named a.j", "\u2013 \u201cwhat if he did this?\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201coh, a.j", "would never do that.\u201d and i\u2019d be like, \u201chuh", "well, maybe he would.\u201d but it was just so much fun and there\u2019s one producer who i read a book of hers and she\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, if you cannot enjoy the process, then you\u2019re screwed because the chances of getting a movie actually made are so infinitesimal and so enjoy the process and enjoy the walk up the mountain, not just the summit.\u201d that was a big lesson", "if you think back, can you think of the best or one of the best investments you\u2019ve ever made", "and that could be time, energy, money", "i\u2019ll give you an example", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah", "so, amelia boone \u2013 three-time world\u2019s toughest mudder champion, most decorated obstacle course racer in the world, full time attorney, also, at apple \u2013 but it was her first entrance fee for one of these races which was, i think at the time, $400.00 or $450.00 which was a stretch", "it was a real expenditure for her but it opened up this entirely new career", "a.j", "jacobs: right", "had she not taken that, who knows", "can you\u2026", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: i love that", "[crosstalk] it doesn\u2019t have to be analogous to that but\u2026 a.j", "jacobs: well, can i go the other way and\u2026", "i have two ideas: one is, about a month ago, i wrote an article for esquire where i got the most expensive haircut in the world in new york city \u2013 an $800.00 haircut", "and it was crazy because it was this guy, it was on park avenue, his name was julien farel, and he was very french, he said, \u201chaircut.\u201d and it was a fascinating learning experience because, of course, it\u2019s not worth $800.00", "that\u2019s insane", "it\u2019s 20 percent better than my supercuts which cost $20.00", "but, just learning he gets clients \u2013 he is booked all the time", "how does he do this", "he\u2019s got goldman-sachs guys who come in every week for an $800.00 haircut and it\u2019s all about the experience", "because the actual cutting is not that different, right, but the experience \u2013 the cappuccino, and the music, and he\u2019ll stare you deep in the eyes and talk to you about what your hair means to you and how it can change your life \u2013 [crosstalk] tough task ahead of him with me, if i go there", "a.j", "jacobs: maybe you get a discount", "although the small remaining parts i have still mean a lot to me", "a.j", "jacobs: there you go", "so, yeah, it was fascinating", "that\u2019s how he does it", "and he\u2019ll look at your skull for five minutes like an artist", "or a phrenologist", "a.j", "jacobs: yeah, a phrenologist", "but so he\u2019s able to get clients by making the experience even though the price is just so ridiculous", "maybe it\u2019s because the price is so ridiculous", "a.j", "jacobs: that\u2019s a good part of it, exactly", "he is just\u2026 so, anyway, i thought that was a\u2026 i did not pay for it, luckily \u2013 esquire paid for it \u2013 [crosstalk] yup", "a.j", "jacobs: so, i guess, one of my first books was about reading the encyclopedia britannica when they still actually printed that", "so, there were 33 volumes and i read them all and that cost $1,500.00 to buy that set \u2013 which is an absurd amount for a book \u2013 but it turned out it paid off", "so, would you say it was that book that was one of the biggest inflection points for you as a writer", "if something put you on the map as a writer, was it that book, or was it an earlier piece, or a different piece", "[crosstalk] a.j", "jacobs: no, it was definitely that \u2013 it took it to a different level", "and i had written a couple of other books before but they were sort of novelty short books like one was called america offline about this wonderful world outside of the internet where you could actually meet people face-to-face and it sold four copies", "it came out, i think \u2013 it probably sucked \u2013 but it was also ahead of its time so that probably\u2026 both played\u2026 but i think the key was that that was the first one with real emotion and it was sort of an emotional ark and i talked about my father, i talked about the meaning of life \u2013 in a lame way, i tried \u2013 and that connected with people", "i think emotion really does that and that\u2019s one of the big lessons of this podcast that i\u2019m doing with gimlet is getting those emotional moments really makes a difference", "so, let\u2019s wrap up on a question directed, well, at you but for the audience", "so, for people listening \u2013 and i\u2019ll certainly tell them\u2026 well, we\u2019ll have two questions", "the first one is not related to where they can find you and so on which is going to be the last question", "this one is really do you have any suggestions, recommendations, parting thoughts for people listening", "something they could try or something that they can just carry with them that might be helpful or useful in some way", "a.j", "jacobs: aside from all the brilliant stuff we talked about for the last two hours", "it could be one that you want to underscore", "a.j", "jacobs: well, i think we both talk about this \u2013 the idea of experimenting with your life is so important because, i think, if you do the same\u2026 routines are good in some ways because they automate things so some parts of your life should be automated but, sometimes, routines cause you to get in a rut like the neurons actually get in a neural rut", "so, doing simple tricks to just shake up your life, i\u2019ve found it incredibly enriching", "i think you have", "for sure", "a.j", "jacobs: and, as i said, it could be just trying a different toothpaste every month", "there\u2019s millions to\u2026 i used crest for 28 years because some kid at my camp used crest and i thought he was cool so i kept buying it", "and i actually don\u2019t like it", "i don\u2019t like it but it took me 28 years to\u2026 and i\u2019m like, \u201cyou know what", "let me try some other stuff.\u201d and, as you said also \u2013 i think this is worth repeating and i\u2019m paraphrasing, here \u2013 but it\u2019s often easier to act your way into thinking differently as opposed to thinking your way into acting differently", "a.j", "jacobs: totally", "yeah", "and, yeah, the quote is \u2013 which is not mine \u2013 is, \u201cit\u2019s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting,\u201d and i do love that", "a.j., it\u2019s always fun to hang out", "we\u2019ve seen each other a little bit this trip in new york city which has been fun", "a.j", "jacobs: great", "and where can people find you and learn more about you on the internet, the podcast, etc.", "where can people check you out and say hi", "a.j", "jacobs: the podcast is called \u201ctwice removed\u201d and it is on itunes \u2013 gimlet media", "and my website is ajjacobs.com, @ajjacobs on twitter, and my book about family \u2013 not genealogy \u2013 is coming out in the fall of 2017", "very, very cool", "a.j., thank so much for taking the time", "a.j", "jacobs: thanks", "i loved it", "and, to everybody listening, as always, you can find the show notes, links to everything that we discussed at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast \u2013 all spelled out \u2013 fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "and, until next time, thank you"]}
