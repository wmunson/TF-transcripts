kevin is a very close friend of mine. he now lives in new york. he is a well known venture capitalist. he's an advisor to google ventures, also now ceo of hodinkee. he was formerly involved with watchville and is now in the luxury goods market that is being distermediated and disrupted with technology. very interesting fellow   and we often do a video show together called the random show, or we used to when we lived in san francisco together. but he's now in nyc, i am usually in sf and we have not done any of these shows so we decided to give audio a shot. please let us know if you enjoy this, and here we go, the random show with timbo and kev-kev.   hello, ladies and gentlemen. this is tim ferriss.  kevin rose: and this is kevin rose. welcome to a brand new edition of the random show. happy 2016.  tim ferriss: happy 2016. happy new year, man.  kevin rose: yeah, same to you.  tim ferriss: it's going to be an exciting year. i can feel it in my bones, my old man bones.  kevin rose: what did you do?  tim ferriss: what did i do, in 2016 so far?  kevin rose: no, just like what did you do for new year's? i want to know where you were, what you did.  tim ferriss: i decided to bring my parents and brother to the bahamas because they had last been 36 years ago when i was two years old, and had always reminisced and spoke of the bahamas fondly and pined after returning. and i just decided - or observed - that none of us are getting any younger and decided to bring everybody here for christmas and new year's, which i'm in a very fortunate position to be able to do, of course   but what i realized, because this is the second time i've taken my family on a trip for christmas and new year's, is that when you set plans, say, early in the year or even halfway through the year, you get at least six months of anticipation and talking about it and dreaming about it, and brainstorming things you're going to do with your family.   at least half the benefit is just being able to put it in the calendar and have the benefit of that anticipation. it's kind of like as a kid looking forward to christmas but you just have to schedule your own christmas, since generally as an adult you're not running down the stairs in your pjs to tear things open. that's what i didwhat about yourself?  kevin rose: i was just here in new york. it was pretty relaxing. for christmas, i actually went out to las vegas, of all places. my family is based out there. so i had my wife's family and my family get together at a resort, the red rock casino out there. we actually watched star wars and just kind of chilled, and had some good food. yeah, it was awesome.  tim ferriss: do you have any particular routine or ritual just before new year's, or on new year's, or after new year's?  kevin rose: definitely every year we talk about new year's resolutions. i don't really stick to them but i definitely have that ritual of the very next morning, just starting things anew and trying to track what it is i'm trying to achieve this coming year. so i did that this year, as well. i've got another list.  tim ferriss: of things you're not going to follow?  kevin rose: yeah, exactly. although, you know me. i have done a few things in the past. for example, i haven't had a soda. this marks my 16th year without having soda, which is kind of nice.  tim ferriss: no kidding. i didn't know that, actually  kevin rose: you didn't know this?  tim ferriss: 16. wow. that's great.  kevin rose: yeah, it was just one of those things. it was new year's 2000everyone was sitting around and talking about their resolutions. i was like, i've kind of wanted to give up soda. it's one of those things where for me, it was something i would consume a couple times a day. back then, i would crack open a dr. pepper or a coke or whatever. i didn't do any of that diet crap; i just went full sugar, or i guess it would be full corn syrup, which is even worse.   but i was doing that and i had to get off of it. it's like, gosh, i've got to start really watching my health. this was kind of the first step in that direction. i gave it up, and i weaned myself off initially. the first few months were extremely difficult. i was able to do it by actually using a substitute. so for me, that was juice.  tim ferriss: i was waiting for heroin or something.  kevin rose: exactly. it was crank, and i just got really addicted. no, but seriously, i started doing juice. and juice would give me that kind of sugar high that i was used to getting from soda. still not ideal but then from there, i was able to slowly dilute my juice down and consume less sugar. listen, sugar addiction and soda addiction is a real thing.  tim ferriss: no, i was just imagining you with a tee shirt on that says \"dilute my juice.\"  kevin rose: you need to start a tee shirt company.  tim ferriss: i don't know why.  kevin rose: it kills you.  tim ferriss: yeah. i do. my buddies and i were talking. we were just kind of pulling these weird combinations of words that came up in conversation after a few glasses of wine. there was another one called journeyman palooka. the palooka - i should look this up - effectively, it's like the jimmy jones of professional wrestling; those guys with the real human names whose sole purpose is to get thrown around and destroyed by the guys who have the cool names like the rock. so someone who is sort of continually - here we go\"a mediocre or inferior boxer.\" that's it. a palooka is a person, p-a-l-o-o-k-a, although there's u-k-a, also. it's the guy they bring into the training camp to make the champ feel good when he's training. so he just gets to body shot them and knock them down.  kevin rose: right, totally.  tim ferriss: that's a palooka. so someone who is basically forever a career palooka is a journeyman palooka. not sure how we got onto that.  kevin rose: you were going to create a tee shirt out of that.  tim ferriss: yeah, i've been thinking about doing tee shirts for awhile. i've chatted with the guys at teespring, for instance, who are fantastici don't know why i haven't pulled the trigger. it's one of those things that i need to review. what i was going to say is for the last four or five years, the habit that i've gotten into before setting any type of resolutions is to do a complete review of the previous yearso i go through a couple of different things.   i look over quotes that i've collected, for instance. i go through my entire ical, or calendar, week by week and i basically do an 80/20 analysis of my emotions; the emotional extremes. so the things i loved and the things i hated. i make a list of the things that i loved and the things that i hated and don't want to spend more time, energy, resources on.   then i review two other journals, the five minute journal, which people have heard me talk about. and then the morning pages. i go through and i figure things out, or try to identify things like why haven't i followed certain resolutions and followed others. i realized if i looked back at, say, my resolutions for 2013 or 2014, i had no more startups. i also had no more interviews.  kevin rose: you were serious about this. when you say startups, do you mean starting a startup, or you were actually talking about investing in startups, is that right?  tim ferriss: that's right. i was talking about no more investing in new startupsi was able to pull the trigger on that in this last year, 2015, and wrote a long post on all of the reasons for taking a startup vacation but why, in broader terms it's important to say no and how to go about doing it. but then you look at no interviews, no media interviews. i haven't been able to stick with that.   so i'll sit down and i'll try to figure out, i know this isn't generally pleasant for me. i know it can backfire when you get misquotedwhy do i continue to do media interviews?  kevin rose: but it's important for your relevance, though. you know that.  tim ferriss: but i'm not convinced it is, at this point. because i've spent so much energy putting out 600-plus blog posts, and writing, and putting out the podcasts, and so on. i feel like for me to justify spending an hour on the phone with someone when they're going to pull out one or two quotes, probably misquote me, and slide it into a big article.  kevin rose: no doubt. you've got to pick your poison.  tim ferriss: i have to ask myself if that time would not be better spent doing something either i enjoy, which doesn't have to be productive, like binge watching archer, which i've been doing while on the islandit's so fantastic, oh, my god. or doing something like working on my own content because i feel like i get a better roi. so that's the type of review that i've been doing.   as i'm reviewing, i'll also make a list based on the things that i loved in the last year, or other ideas of the fun stuff to schedulebecause what i've realized about myself, and i think this is true for a lot of people, is that they don't pre-schedule the fun stuff, like week long trips to abc, or pack trips, whatever it might be - and i have a list of stuff for 2016 that i'd like to do - the work or some type of frivolous bullshit like just sitting on social media will swell to fill the void   it will expand to fill that space. so that's sort of where i'm goingdo you have anything in particular that you want to do, not just resolutions because we're going to talk about that, like behaviorsbut any new types of trips or experiences?  kevin rose: a lot of that was this last year. at some point, my wife daria and i are going to have kids. we've talked about this, tim. i think that you kind of want to prepare for that and get a lot of these experiences and things that you want to do while you're still young and kidless out of the way. so i've spent a lot of time trying to knock out that list, travel-wise. so any time i can do something for work travel-wise, i tend to tack on a couple extra days so that daria can go along with and we can have fun together as a coupleso for example, in a couple weeks i'm heading off to geneva, switzerland for a conference that i need to attend   i'll be there for three days, and then we're going three days early so we get a weekend time and make that a thing; make that a mini vacation. and then honestly, one of the things i did for the first time this last year that i will do again this year, is take a few days and typically, i do this with a holiday weekend where you have already baked in three days off.   and add on a couple of days on top of that and get a full week and get a staycation, where you just stay at home and really focus on the stuff that you really, really want to do but never actually have time to do. i'm not talking about chores, but more just personal improvement stuff or things that every single week it gets pushed to the next week.  tim ferriss: what are those things for you?  kevin rose: gosh, for me it's around organization and little, dumb things like cleaning off my desktop on my computer. that feels so good, you know? getting to inbox zero on one of my personal accountsgetting into the sauna, or starting something new. i'll talk about the wim hof method, which i know you've interviewed him on your podcast. i'm now going into week four on that. that was something i started during my staycation.  tim ferriss: very cool. i want to ask for some help from folks on a couple of things on my list   seven to ten day water only fast; i already did that, which i'll hopefully have some reports on for folks.  kevin rose: did you talk about that anywhere on any of your other podcasts?  tim ferriss: no, i haven't really gone into detail. i did a ten day water only fast.  kevin rose: we've both done fasting in the past. the most i've ever done is a 24 hour fast. i did a juice fast of three days; just juice only i'm really curious. can you give us the quick little rundown of why and what it felt like?  tim ferriss: the rundown of why is easy. there's quite a bit of data in the scientific literature and just empirical from friends of mine who do a lot of work with fasting, a lot of which is unpublished at this point. but talking to people like dominic d'agostino. dom d'agostino, for anyone interested in fasting or preventing cancer, ketogenic diet; that's the podcast you want to listen to. we cover everything.   it appears to be a very effective way to purge precancerous cells. so if you're over the age of, say, 35 or 40, i think the number i've heard is something like 70 percent of people have cancerous cells that could become potentially problematic later. it's not so much of a problem that you have mutations that have caused cancerous cells. it's when they grow out of control or become malignant or metastasize that you get yourself into trouble. so fasting at this point my personal protocol is i'm trying to do one full day a week, intermittent fasting   i've been doing intermittent fasting for the last 14 days or so because the bahamas are not known for being slow carb or keto friendly. so i'm having rice for my evening meal but i\u00f4m fasting until about 12 p.m. or 1 p.m. and then eating in a six to eight hour window   but the protocol, if we're looking at strict fasting, not the 12 to 18 hour fast, i'm looking at 24 hours a week, one three day fast a month and then one seven to ten day fast per quarter. i've actually only stuck to the longer fasts once every six months or so because you do pay a productivity penalty. the trick, if you're doing a longer fast like that, and you should never do it without medical supervision. ketoacidosis as a diabetic is not the only thing you would have to worry about; there are other things that can go sideways   so you really want to ensure that you have medical supervision if you're doing a longer fast of any type. i'm going to have some data to share on this but i really want to look through it all. based on dxa scans and bioimpedance and all sorts of stuff that i tracked, i didn't lose any muscle mass over what was effectively a nine and a half day fast.   there are a bunch of tricks that you could use for that but one of the most important aspects of threading that needle is getting into ketosis, where your body is using body fat as fuel as opposed to glucose - blood sugar - is getting into ketosis as quickly as possible. because what a lot of folks will do is, say, juice fast or they'll just go full starvation and won't expedite the process of getting into ketosis. so they have three or four days where they are effectively eating muscle tissue   that's being broken down into amino acids that the liver then converts to glucose through something called gluconeogenesis. i'm doing a lot of experimentation with this. dom d'agostino is the guy i rely on, so people should definitely listen to that podcast. as far as how i felt, i was able to work as much or as little as i wanted. i did light exercise.ithere were really only i would say, two days out of the nine where i was just a whiney little bitch who wasn't getting anything doneit was a good thing i set parameters for myself so that i wouldn't send off a bunch of really bitchy emails to people and create a mess for myself  kevin rose: i've done a handful of these fasts in the past and i will tell you i tried, like any rookie does when he first gets started with this stuff, i tried a juice fast as my first one. that was a horrible experience.  tim ferriss: yeah, it's the worst.  kevin rose: because you're right. you don't get into ketosis. i had to run to the bathroom - you probably know why - just because your gut just explodes into the toilet.  tim ferriss: if you're consuming that much fruit juice, you just get disaster pants all day. it's terrible.  kevin rose: it was really bad. but then, you were talking about it a little bit and i remember hugh jackman had an interview on 20/20 where they asked him how he gets so ripped to play the role of wolverine   he said, \"the rock actually gave me his secret, and this sounds really silly but it was intermittent fasting.\" he said, \"i intermittent fast. i go 16 hours fast every single day when i'm shooting the movie and then i eat for eight hours.\" that's what he did. so i started trying that. i probably did intermittent fasting, i would say, maybe two months out of last year. it gets you shredded quickly   so that was a lot of fun and it's a nice little kick in the pants to get you into ketosis faster. i'm excited to try. one of the other things that i saw that i don't know if you've seen the study that came out here a couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was a month ago, was this thing called mimic fasting. have you heard of that?  tim ferriss: the fast mimicking diet. i want to say that's based on longo's research. why don't you explain for people what that is? i have some reservations about it but there are definitely people who are  following this protocol.  tim ferriss: there was a paper that came out about it that essentially, they talk about the really big benefits and i'm not talking about a flat stomach but more of the stuff that tim was talking about along the lines of anti cancer and some other things kicking in as you get into the longer duration fast so once you're day two, three, and on it's really difficult, though, as anyone will tell you when you do these really long fasts   the idea was that they could mimic fasting by serving you things like really lightweight broths in soups. so you are still consuming some calories but it's not a ton. and you have a couple of these little, tiny, broth based meals per day. your body still goes into the fasting state but it's not as brutal as the traditional, full on just water fast.  tim ferriss: i want to say it's less than 400 calories a day, or something like that.  kevin rose: something like that, that's right.  tim ferriss: i will say there are some data that would seem to indicate that pure fasting still exceeds the benefits of low or severe caloric constriction in terms of lowering igf-1, and so on. one could then debate whether lowering igf-1 in fact extends longevity in the same way that you could argue about whether lowering homocysteine decreases inflammation, and there's a lot of debate about both of those.   that's the first thing on the list. i already knocked it off. i was going to do that in 2016 but i did it towards the end of 2015 and i'll do it again. one thing i'd love recommendations for from people listening is i'd like to create some short films. what i realized is i need to do more things just for the fuck of it.   for instance, hiring people or paying creatives just to make cool shit, without any profit motive whatsoever. so i can find high endurance creatives to help make, for instance, short films - i eventually want to do some feature film stuff. when i was chatting with robert rodriguez, i got the idea - or maybe he gave me the idea - of making a few short films. and i think evan goldberg and seth rogen also said this, so that i could go from start to finish in a micro sense from drafting up the screenplay, so to speak, doing the storyboarding, working with a full team, director, etc   so i think that's something i'm going to do; make a couple of five to ten minute short films. and if anyone has any particular recommendations for that, i am all ears. so please just hit us up on twitter, hashtag random show. while we're at it, kevin, what's your twitter handle?  kevin rose: @kevinrose.  tim ferriss: and i am @tferriss because i'm an idiot    other things that i would love recommendations on, i've never been to montreal and i've been dying to go to montreal. so if people have recommendations for when to go, what to do, hashtag random show, let me know, montreal. i'm focusing on bodyweight exercises and gymnastics training. there's a very interesting guy, i think it's chris somers with gymnastic bodies, which i follow on instagram. i've pinged a couple of my buddies; max shank is another one who's very interesting to check out   i want to focus on doing two moves, and you can google these because it's a bit of a hassle to visualize a planche. you know what, fuck it. i'll take a stab at describing it. so a planche pushup is where you're flat on your hands or on your fingertips, and your legs are spread   you're in a pushup position and your feet are off the ground. what that means is you have to lean forward so that your shoulders are way ahead of your hands. so i want to get to the point where i can do a comfortable planch or a planch pushup, and also something called a front lever, which is kind of almost the upside down version of a planch, in a way, but you're hanging from a bar and your body is completely parallel to the ground but you're levitating.    and of course you're connected through your arms to the bar. so people have recommendations for any particular exercises that have helped them with quantum leaps in progress with either of those, hashtag random show. let me know. i would love to hear about it.  kevin rose: i'm looking at the planch pushup right now. there's now way in hell you're going to pull this off. you're way too big.  tim ferriss: i'm optimistic.  kevin rose: it's like little tiny dudes doing this.  tim ferriss: yeah, they tend to be a little small but there are beefier dudes who do it and i'm optimistic. so i'm going to give it a shot.   i might have to cut off my legs at the knees or lose a lot of quadzilla size in my legs, but i'm optimistic. so i'm working on that. it definitely does not help if you have a lot of extra weight in your legs to do either of those things.  kevin rose: so is this one of your new year's resolutions or just something you want to do in general?  tim ferriss: i would say it's a new year's resolution. those are two movements i'd like to stick. i'd also like to get to the point where i can do a slow - i'm going to fuck up the terminology here and sorry for the cursing, guys. i got criticized because some people listen to these with their kids. but alas, from long island; i apologize. i'd like to be able to do a slow handstand from standing with legs together, knees locked where i just slowly go down to palms on the floor. and i guess that would be in the pipe position; just go straight up to a handstand and i can lower my feet down, tap the toes and come back up. i'd like to get to that point.  kevin rose: that sounds doable.  tim ferriss: it looks more doable than the planche, yes.  kevin rose: i told you what i've been doing for my core strength, right? did i mention this to you, the pilates thing?  tim ferriss: no, you didn't mention it to me.  kevin rose: it's been three months of pilates twice a week for me. you can laugh all you want.  tim ferriss: no, i like pilates.  kevin rose: hold on. let me explain. i hate you.  tim ferriss: it's good for your pelvic floor. are you doing kegels?  kevin rose: you go to the gym, and i walk by the pilates studio and yes, it doesn't typically tend to be very many guys in there. it's kind of like core strength and all the guys are out there hitting the iron. i get that. but you know, i have always had a really crappy coreand for me as a guy, i feel a lot of guys are like this   i would say legs and core are two things that typically get overlooked. a lot of guys go to the gym, they hit upper body, they hit shoulders, they hit chest. so i always had a really weak core, and i knew that. i started to have some back issues this last year so i was like, now's the time to really get serious about my core. and i did what anyone else would do; those leg lifts at the gym. and then i was just like, i'm really not getting the results, this sucks. i don't feel motivated. it's the last thing i do. i always kind of do half the reps i want to do   and so i tried a pilates class. i didn't try the group class. i went to an instructor so i could get the full on experience. i found a semi reasonable instructor price-wise and i go twice a week, and it's been amazing. i would say that i can do things with my abilities i never thought possible. granted, they're still not showing due to beer and pizza and things of that nature.  tim ferriss: underneath the ripples of fat, you're shredded.  kevin rose: underneath there is a ripped nine-pack. seriously, though, it's a lot of fun because pilates is one of those things that if you have an instructor, there are so many exercises that it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing every time. it's something like 30 different moves. so she's constantly changing it up, having me do different things. she started me at the correct pace where i wasn't killing myself but at the end of every session i'm definitely sweating and i just feel stronger. so it's been a fun practice for me to add into the tail end of last year.  tim ferriss: i think pilates, the strict, classical pilates is fantastic. it's very similar in a lot of ways to gymnastics training, actually, with a tremendous amount of focus on pelvic tilt and becoming comfortable in different positions and understanding pelvic tilt, and then something called the transverse abdominis   so people can think of that as a corset muscle that runs horizontally across - this is simplified, obviously - but across your abdomen.. and if you cough or laugh really hard and you get sore in the mid section, that's the transverse abdominis. when people have really lax or weak transverse abdominis, you notice a lot of things. and if they have tight hip flexures for a whole host of reasons like not sitting enough, not stretching the hip flexures, not having strong muscles around the pelvis, you see people who have low body fat but look fat when they're just standing there in clothing because they have the hips kind of pouring forward   that makes their gut stick out, and then they have a protruding belling because they have weak transverse abdominis. pilates is great for that. i get asked a lot by women, for instance, what should i do for exercise? i want to look like this person, look like that person.   and they point out very athletic dancers or celebrities, etcinevitably, if they want to keep it simple - and this could apply for guys, too but i do get this question specifically from women a lot - it's pilates and two handed kettle bell swings. if you do pilates, very classical, technical, unforgiving pilates and kettle bell swings, and let's just say you did that twice a week, like monday, wednesday friday. monday and friday you do the kettle bell swings, wednesday you do the pilates or vise versa. you could alternate weeks, even   so it would be like pilates monday, kettle bell wednesday, pilates friday, kettle bells monday, that way. you can get in fantastic, incredible shape and all you would need to do is moderate carbohydrate consumption with something like slow carb or paleo or whatever. which i still think is, for a lot of people , more sustainable than intermittent fasting. i did light up the internet accidentally   i did a little bit of internet arson inadvertently because i put a post on facebook and twitter saying most people who do intermittent fasting are just getting smaller, not leaner; meaning they're losing muscle mass. that was based on data from a friend of mine who runs a dxa scan facility, which gives you a very good idea of exactly what's happening with your body composition; body fat and muscle. she said the vast majority of guys, and they do tend to be guys, who come in and do an experiment with intermittent fasting lose a lot of muscle mass   so they lose weight, they're looking at the scale, they think they're doing a good job and in fact they're backsliding because their body fat percentage is going up. the internet freaked out about that. but i think ultimately when you're looking at resolutions or making changes in the new year, the good plan that you all follow is better than the perfect plan you're going to quit in two weeks. so there you have it.   another thing i would like feedback on from people is i'm considering doing live podcasts and traveling around the countryi'll probably do some tests in la first, and then san francisco and new york. and then i'm thinking about hitting a bunch of lesser known or lesser traveled places like montana, and going on a road trip and actually going around the country. what are your thoughts on that? you've done more live shows than i have.kevin rose: i've certainly done a lot of live shows back in the day with dig nation. when you say live, do you mean audience or no audience?  tim ferriss: i mean audience. i mean actually meeting people and just traveling around the country. i would obviously test this first in a few places where i'm comfortable and know i can fill seats like la, sf, new york. but then i'd be doing live audience for sure.  kevin rose: it's chaotic. i think if you would hire a person or two to help out, to help manage some of the chaos, and then certainly very directional microphones so you don't pick up the entire crowd. it's a lot of fun and it's good to kind of vibe off the audience and feel the energy when they laugh at certain things you're talking aboutyou can always take live questions or things like that. why not? why not experiment? do it.  tim ferriss: i think i'm going to do it in la, first in january or february, so that's coming up soon. so keep an eye out, folks. if you have any thoughts, let me know. if you have any thoughts on venues for like 500 to 2,000 people, and kevin, is there a sweet spot of audience size for you?  kevin rose: i've always enjoyed the slightly more intimate shows. when you get going into the bigger venues, typically they ask for more money and they charge.   whereas you can go and find nice bars with a small stage that say hey, if you're going to fill this up with people, i'll just give you the space for free. like beach chalet out in san francisco is one of my favorite spots and we used to do shows out there.  tim ferriss: beach chalet?  kevin rose: yeah, it's right out by ocean beach. they can hold probably 500 people. i just picked a slow night. do it on a monday or tuesday night or something and they'll just give you the space. they set up speakers for us and it was just completely free because they knew they would sell more beer.  tim ferriss: coolyou mentioned an app to me that you were finding useful. i don't know if you want to hold that back for later but i'd like to hear more about it.  kevin rose: absolutely. along with new year's resolutions comes the need to track all this stuff. you and i are both very kind of quantified people!  last year, i tracked my alcohol consumption in a google spreadsheet, which was great. every single day i would color code it. i wrote a little script so that based on what i typed in, it would change it to either green, orange or red.  tim ferriss: and just to be clear for folks, he was trying to beat 30 drinks a week. that was green.  kevin rose: yes, i was trying to go for at least 50 to 60 drinks per week. no, it was really eye opening. because you tend to just think oh, i've got this even tonight, no big deal, let me go have three drinks. oh, there's an event two nights from now. my wife wants to crack a bottle open. and you don't realize not only how many drinks you're having but just the sheer amount of calories you're putting into your body in consuming all this alcohol   so it was eye opening for me. but it wasn't something that was easy to do on the go, especially when you start layering in other things. why don't we do this. i'll give you my quick, little 30 second rundown of all the stuff i'm trying to track. the name of the app that i'm using that i found is way of life.   and i think by far it is the best habit tracking app out there. it's really simple to set up. it creates beautiful charts and graphs out of the data. you say yes, no, or i skipped it. you can set up things that are also negative. so for example, one of the things they have is did i drink over three drinks? so if i say yes to that, it will actually turn it red instead of green. so i'll give you my quick list   no. 1 - and these are not in any specific order - watch a ted talk every day. that's going to be easy. i subscribe to the ted video podcast on itunes and i'm going to watch one every single day for the entire year. sauna three times a week. i want to get serious about heat.  tim ferriss: me, too. ditto.  kevin rose: i've already done it three times this week. i'm going to skip today but i'm going to go tomorrow. i alternate a cold bath and sauna. i found a great place in new york; they have turkish and russian baths   the cold is extremely cold and i go in there, and i can talk about the wim hoff method later, what i'm doing to stay in there for long periods of time. the third one is two or less drinks. so i'm trying every single day to consume two or less drinks. i'm tracking my pilates. i'm also tracking meditation. i'm tracking weight lifting; trying to do that three times per week. i'm tracking no alcohol, so those are days i take entirely off from drinking. i want to know how many days i'm doing that per month, and you can see month over month progress with this app; it's wonderful   i'm tracking no sugar. i'm tracking tea consumption. so out of the last seven days, i've had tea four days. no coffee. i am trying to do tea only for a few days. coffee has been a crutch for me for a very long time so i'm trying to slowly wean myself. i don't inherently think that coffee is bad for you. there is a little bit of data if you drink more than two cups, it can increase your homocysteine levels, which i have elevated but that could be because i have that mother fucking gene. you know what i'm talking about, the mthr?  tim ferriss: mthfr gene, or some nonsense like that.  kevin rose: so that could be why. and then also slow carb. i'm living the tim ferriss lifestyle.  tim ferriss: living the vita ferriss.  kevin rose: when i say slow carb, i tend to mean a little bit more on the keto side. obviously, that's also slow carb-ish. i do a kind of modified keto that is a lot more veggie forward.  tim ferriss: veggie forward? sounds like a wine. mmm, broccoli on the tongue.  kevin rose: exactly. so that's everything i'm tracking and this app is phenomenal.  tim ferriss: that is a lot to track, man. are you not worried that you're going to flame out because of too many variables? it seems like you spend a lot of your time inputting data.  kevin rose: the beautiful thing about this app is it's not about typing a ton of notes. yes, there's a section for that but it's simply yes or no questions. like did you have alcohol today, and you tap yes or nothen it goes onto the next one. it's all done in a vertical list of things so you don't have to view any additional screens.   seriously, it sends me a text every night at 10 p.m. because i set that up in the app. then i go in there and it takes me all of, i'd say, 30 seconds to input all the data. and this is the fun thing. every first of the month, so come february 1st, i'm going to tweet out my results from last month.  tim ferriss: that's smart.  kevin rose: it creates a little, tiny spreadsheet for you that you can tweet out, like a little, tiny graphic. it's going to be fun.  tim ferriss: yes, if you force yourself to do that. although now, people know so if you get to the second of the month, anybody listening, and you remember and you see that kevin hasn't put up his numbers, you can remind him on twitter.  kevin rose: please remind me.  tim ferriss: i wanted to underscore something here about resolutions and goals in general; behavioral change. that is if it's not in the calendar and if you don't have some type of consequence or stakes, you're not going to do it   for instance, i've seen a number of new year's resolutions lists online from fans. they often say i want to meditate more, i want to drink less alcohol. not only is that not specific enough, you want to make it measurable. you want to have some type of quantified goal. but there's no punishment or real reward for not following that behavior, if that makes sense. so two things. get it in the calendar. so if you say meditate more, and let's say you decide that means you're going to meditate three times a week for one minute in the morning, or five minutes in the morning or before bed, put it in the calendar or it will get crowded out   the second is have either an accountability partner, or put together a betting pool with a bunch of friends. i talk about this a lot in the four hour chef because it's about accelerated learning. i'm going to put up an excerpt from that chapter for free for people to check out.   i'll put it at fourhourworkweek.com/stakes, like tent stake, s-t-a-k-e-s. so fourhourworkweek.com/stakes and i'll put that up. but you need to have some type of reward or punishment. punishment generally beats out reward. i know that sounds funny but the prospect of losing, say, $100 in a betting pool will motivate you more than the possibility of winning $100. this has been very well researched. or some type of pubic embarrassment works very well, also. or being humiliated because you didn't live up to your side of the bargainlike if kevin doesn't put out his numbers and then people give him a bunch of shit on february or march 2nd, that will be a motivator for kevin.  kevin rose: it's a huge motivator. i'm going to expose all of my drink data and everything else directly online, so i'm excited for that   the other thing i'll add on top of that is i was reading a post, i believe it was a study that was done that talks about when you're trying to form a new habit, try combining it with something you enjoy doing. have you heard this at all? so for example, if you're going to the gym and getting on the treadmill for the first time, bring your favorite new series, archer or whatever it may be, and put it on your ipad and watch that while you're working out. so you're doing something you enjoy. so for me, i get through serious treadmill sessions at insane inclines  tim ferriss: like 2 to 3 degrees?  kevin rose: oh yeah, right. i'm talking like 8 plus degrees but really slow. and i'm just drenched in sweat but i'm playing a tower defense game that i love. so that's my time to game but also get my exercise. if you're going to meditate, do a shot of whiskey before. no, i'm just kidding. don't combine like that. actually, one thing i do do, if i can make it on a streak for three days in a row with no alcohol at all, i go to the kava bar and i have a full bowl of kava. it's amazing.  tim ferriss: i know, you've told me. i don't know enough about kava to know whether it's better or worse for you than going without alcohol for three days straight.  kevin rose: let me give everyone the 30 second rundown on this. basically, there is an herb called kava. you can go to whole foods or any grocery store almost and buy it in a kind of tea form. actually, yogi tea makes one on amazon that has five star reviews; almost a solid five starts with 5,000 reviews. use a couple of those tea bags, soak it for 15 minutes and then drink it like tea. it puts you in a very relaxed state   it's almost like you've had a couple glasses of champagne but without drinking. they actually have bars that are popping up over in new york that don't serve alcohol; they just serve kava. you co in and they give you a bowl full of kava. it tastes like dirt, and you just kind of down itiand then within 15, 20 minutes you just feel like sinking into your chair and you're totally mellowed out. get it while it's legal.  tim ferriss: a side note for folks, smoking like a hookah pipe is not risk freeyou can down the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes very easily sitting at a hookah bar. so that is not without its risks. speaking of chilling out, i want to recommend that people consider picking up the practice of meditation because it is a very cumulatively powerful habit to begin. it doesn't have to be super woo-hoo or new agey. i was looking at twitter yesterday, actually. we both have a friend, bobby goodlatte - is it goodlatte? is that how you say his last name?  kevin rose: it's just goodlot.  tim ferriss: jesus christ. goodlot, i've never really known because i always hear just his first name   but resolutions for 2016, 1) stick to tim ferriss' excellent slow carb diet for as long as i can bear. he's used it before so it's not that hard. 2) use headspace or meditate regularly. there are a couple of different approaches you could take for getting started with meditation. one was recommended to be by kamal ravikant, a very, very smart and good friend of mine. and it was very simple. this actually comes back to your gaming while you're on the treadmill. so people who don't want to meditate, pick a song that puts you in a good mood   for me, it was \"i'm gonna party like it's 1999\" by prince, because it's hard to take yourself too seriously or be in a bad mood with that song. you're simply going to sit on a cushion or on a couch with your back against the back of the couch or the wallyou're just going to focus on your breathing to the extent possible for one song. that's all you're going to do. you just get into the habit of doing that, and you do it just in the morning. once in the morning and it's, whatever it is; three minutes long.   if you want to go a little bit further, and even people who meditate regularly without any tools use, for instance, headspace. you used headspace, didn't you?  kevin rose: yes, for a long time. i'm actually doing wim hof's meditation stuff now but yeah, i love headspace. i was on the phone with my sister last night and she was looking to getting into meditation. the first thing i do is always recommend headspace. they have this ten days for ten minutes a day. it's called the \"take 10 challenge.\" if you get through those ten days, you'll be sold; it's amazing.  tim ferriss: and to that point just broadly speaking, one of the things i do when i review my calendar for the year and i make my list of things that have had the greatest positive and negative emotional impacts over the year, and i look at them as categories, usually what i end up with is a set of challenges or things you'd like to change in the following year. and one of the questions that i've tried to start asking is what if it were easy? what would that look like?    so with meditation or working out, even the term working out is i think a disservice to a lot of people. because they go to the gym and they want to push themselves after doing, say, no exercise for six months. so they try to go to the gym for an hour a day for five days. they miss one of those days and they feel like a failure and then they quit. it's like, you're setting the bar too high. what would it look like if it were easy? one set of kettle bell swings twice a week; start there. or getting on the treadmill for five minutes, meditating for three minutes   because ultimately, it doesn't matter how effective something is, doesn't matter how efficient something it is; if you don't adhere to it, it doesn't work.  kevin rose: another great one is just 10,000 steps a day with a fitbit. you can actually lose weight that way. i have people that have set these 10,000 step a day goals and just use the fitbit to track it.  tim ferriss: absolutely. i think that it's important to realize, and i remember oprah winfrey said this at some point. she always said, \"i always felt like if i weren't stressed out i wasn't trying hard enough.\" she doesn't feel that way anymore. and i've realized, especially after conversations with guys like derek sivers who has this story about biking, going for this bike circuit in i think it was santa monicahe would huff and puff and try to break his time record every day, and it was 43 minutes. he could never break 43 minutes. it was this long, ten mile track or whatever - i'm making up the distance but something like that   then one day, he's like: you know what, i'm bummed out. he started wanting to skip the ride because it was just too intense and wasn't enjoyable. he's like: i'm just going to cruise and enjoy myself this time. he took the same route and he came back and it was 45 minutes instead of 43. he's like, what? all that discomfort, all of that grunting and groaning and just feeling miserable and the only gain was two minutes out of 45. that was the only improvement.   i feel like for a lot of the things we do, whether that's managing investment, or exercise, or i have a list, here. i actually did this exercise a couple of days ago where it's like okay, podcast excerpts, audio books, book publication, body weight training, investing, getting entertainment guests on the podcast, crowdfunding, dog training, waking up early. like what if it were easy? what would that look like, and actually writing it out? and it's incredible how many problems you can solve just by not creating problems for yourself in complexity. what type of health goals do you have for 2016? any particular health goals or changes?  kevin rose: i think in listening to and getting into rhonda patrick's podcast, the role of micro nutrients in our overall health is just fascinating to me. i had always been one of these guys who grabs a couple of slices of pizza and yes, tim, i did have some yesterday but that was my last day.   tim ferriss: you say that every time.  kevin rose: no, i'm serious. it was my cheat day, tim.  tim ferriss: i never do this. oh, my god, i never do this.  kevin rose: what i'm saying is in my head, i would rationalize it saying: well, i'm taking my multivitamin. and that just doesn't get the full spectrum; it doesn't really get what you need. and so in watching her podcast and understanding a little bit more about what we need to consume to be healthy, i've really upped my vegetable intakeso i'm doing a wide spectrum, wide range of colors in my vegetables and just having one massive salad per day. i've been doing that for a couple months, now. i certainly feel a lot better and my skin actually looks better, too. it's healthier.  tim ferriss: you look pregnant. you have that glow.  kevin rose: i have that glow about me.  tim ferriss: so do i. it's kind of an oily sheen. i've been eating sardines every morning, having a can of wild planet sardines that i've talked about before.ii will just tell people the way that i use it, and i think i've mentioned this once before, is i'm traveling. my dog doesn't like to eat dry kibble. yours doesn't, either. but if i bring the \"origin,\" is the type of kibble i brought. i don't use the \"foul\" for reasons i can explain another time. but i think it's the red label - it sounds like johnny walker - origin. i will open the can of sardines and then pour the oil on top o9f the kibble and then eat the sardines myself.  kevin rose: that's awesome.  tim ferriss: so molly, my dog, is getting the olive oil and the sardine juice. she was having some dry skin issues, like brittle hair issues and i couldn't pinpoint the issue. within three days of starting to add the sardine oil to just one meal a day, and i'm feeding her twice a day, perfect coat, skin, everything; completely fixed after three daysyou have to assume on some level, being mammals as we are, that there's some type of corresponding effect in humans.  kevin rose: absolutely.  tim ferriss: i wanted to mention a book that i recently read that people might want to check out. i believe it was mentioned and recommended to me by one of the podcast guests i've had on because it was on this running list of books to pick up. it's called happy money; the science of happier spending. the authors are elizabeth dunn and michael norton. let me read the description: \"two professors combine their fascinating and cutting edge research in behavioral science to explain how money can buy happiness if you follow five core principles of smart spending.\"    now, there are a couple of caveats here. the first is that this is not a perfect book; there are very few perfect books out there. i think one of the things you should always keep in mind when you're reading any type of pop science book is asking yourself whenever they have an assertion, asking yourself: is this causation or could it just be correlation?   for those of you who have the four hour body, there's an appendix on good science, bad science and spotting the difference, and that's a worthwhile chapter to read. but the example i'll give, and you see this in the media all the time where people will say something like, \"people who practice yoga have lower blood pressure, a new study finds.\" and then, they continue to say, \"therefore, you should start doing yoga and it only takes ten minutes a session, three times a week.\"i but if you were to actually dig into the data and you asked yourself, wait a second. is it causation? is the yoga actually causing the blood pressure or could it just be correlation? meaning they're just happening at the same time. so for instance, maybe they're comparing the blood pressure of people in, i don't know, a hospital in the bronx - i'm just making this up - a sedentary population.   then they're checking the blood pressure of people in the west village who are going to yoga class. and it's like well, okay.  kevin rose: right, and they're also eating wild salmon several times a week, and also eating salads.  tim ferriss: exactly. there's one group eating at mickey d's and fast food, and the other people are eating at whole foods. it's like okay, that could be an issue that's confounding everything. and in this book, there are quite a few places where i think they make arguments of causation where it's probably correlation. however, that having been said, there are principles and also stories that illustrate the principles, like paying for things in advance   like i mentioned committing to this holiday christmas trip with my family six months plus in advance so you can benefit from the anticipation. so prepaying for certain types of experiences as opposed to possessions. they walk through what types of experiences tend to give the greatest emotional and psychological roi   they talk about different types of behavioral psychological studies that someone like, say, daniel gilbert might talk about stumbling upon happiness and how you can use them to your advantage. it's not only for people with a ton of disposable income. one could argue that the less income you make, the more important this becomes because you have a fewer absolute number of dollars to spend at liberty, as it were, and the pain of misspending is even greater.   i found this book very useful for this particular point in time, meaning new year's resolutions because you can then say take these different questions that they arm you with, and go through your credit card statement. and actually make categories of things you want to start to eliminate, minimize, or add in. i found that to be just a very useful exercise.ithere's tons of information out there about how to invest your money. but every time you make a purchase, you're investing in some respect. you're trading money, this wampum for an experience or a possession that you think is going to give you something. it's a very fast read.  kevin rose: it's also available on audio. i got it on audible, by the way. i just downloaded it.  tim ferriss: it says 226 pages but i'd say the last 70 pages are notes and references and whatnot,. so it's really only about 150 pages longyou could read it in a day or two. it's a very fast read. so i thought i'd recommend that one, as well. any favorite books from 2015 that you would recommend people check out?  kevin rose: gosh, i'd have to go back and look at my list. i've got it all on audible. oh, one thing before i forget. and this is the random show so we're allowed to jump around a little bit   you were mentioning canned fish just a few minutes ago. so next time you're in town, i want to take you to a place in new yorkit's called maiden lane and it is unbelievable. basically what they've done is they've created a wine bar that serves nothing but extremely high end canned fish, and they have them stacked on the wall. so you can walk over there and pick out what canned fish you want, and they pair a wine with it and give you cheese with itit is phenomenal   i go over there and i get cod livers, which sound disgusting but are obviously really nutritious for you. i have cod liver with some cheese and a really dry white wine and it's just a fun place to hang out.  tim ferriss: is that after your pilates or before your pilates?  kevin rose: i know you would love it. what's funny is that you act all tough here but if you came to town, you'd be like oh, cod liver, i love this[inaudible] -  [crosstalk]  tim ferriss: are you kidding? no, totally. i'd wear my\u00e9 i'm trying to decide what type of turtleneck and skinny jeans i'd bring. i'd be down, manii'm totally down for the canned fish. it's easy to travel with, alsoso if you go to a location, and a lot of tropical places are like this. i shouldn't say tropical. i should say island cultures have very mediocre food. because aside from the fish, they have to bring everything in. it's very expensive. they're often very onerous excise and import taxes. so the food quality tends to be pretty lowso in a best case scenario, highway robbery. so raveling with cans of sardines, i though it would be difficult. and maybe i'm just an outlier but it made it through with no problem whatsoever. have you read radical acceptance?  kevin rose: yes.  tim ferriss: what did you think? because i think daria was actually one of the first people to recommend it to me. it's by tara brock.  kevin rose: i'm looking at audible right now. oh, you know what? i didn't read it. i ended up watching her ted talk.  tim ferriss: that's the danger of ted talks.  kevin rose: which is pretty much the same thing.  tim ferriss: i think the book is very worth reading. tara was on the podcastshe's a buddhist teacher and i'm very skeptical always of people who are self described teachers of different faiths or aspects of spirituality because there is a lot of nonsense out there. tara is absolutely the real deal her dharma talks are incredible,. but this book, radical acceptance, was recommended to me not only by daria, who is about as non-woo woo as you can get; phd in neuroscience   but at least one or two other scientists recommended it to me, which i thought was very unusual for a book in this genre. it's in effect how to stop beating the shit out of yourself, or carrying around anger and resentment. it's very, very good. i'm just going to read a couple of highlights. i'm looking at my kindle highlights on my laptop, and i have 60 highlighted passages. but here are just a few.   i tend to highlight things that either i want to remember or review, or lines that have nice turns of phrase or wording. here it is. \"i k new i would never treat a friend the way i treated myself; without mercy or kindness.\" so one of my resolutions that i'm going to then put into a measurable form that i can assess somehow is to treat myself the way i would treat a very close friend. because i do think i have a habit to really kind of smash my head against the wall and to be very unforgiving to myself   let me find another one. and i know, kevin, you can attest to the fact that there are a lot of successful - and unsuccessful - but very successful people in silicon valley who could identify with this\"as a friend of mine put it - quote - feeling that something is wrong with me is the invisible and toxic gas i'm always breathing, end quote.\"    i just think that this book is extremely helpful for walking people through the thought process in making subconscious judgments conscious so they can deal with them, so they can somehow fix them. let me find one more. i'll give one more example. this is a story about a tiger that was in captivity in a zoo named mohini that was rescued from an animal sanctuary. mohini had been confined to i think it was a ten by ten foot cage with a concrete floor for five or ten years   they finally released her into this big pasture. \"with excitement and anticipation, they released mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late. the tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. she paced and paced in that corner until an area 12 by 12 feet was worn bare of [01:04:00] grass.   \"perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns.\" this is where the review of the 2015\u00e9   okay, we're back after a bahamian internet connectivity interruption. the power has been going out intermittently for the last three days across the entire island. the story wasn't that interesting so i will leave it where it cut off and continue. mrrose, over to you.  kevin rose: yes. i just have one last thing to say. you asked me about book recommendations earlier and i couldn't recall lit off the top of my head. but i pulled up my audible account.  tim ferriss: shit. i lost you, buddy. can you hear me?  kevin rose: i can hear you, yes.  tim ferriss: okay, you're back. forge ahead.kevin rose: maybe we should just call it a show?  tim ferriss: i'd say we're getting close to that point.  kevin rose: we're getting close, okay. so the last thing i wanted to say was just my book recommendation that i have for the episode. it's called the good gut, have you heard of it?  tim ferriss: no. is it like wheat belly?  kevin rose: no, this is all about gut bacteria and how they influence your overall health. this is a pair of scientists that wrote this book that actually rhonda had on her podcast, as well. really fascinating stuff about how gut bacteria influences health, how animals bring in healthy bacteria so actually having a dog could potentially be a good thing for you. so letting them lick you on the mouth is not that horrible.  tim ferriss: it's a good thing i make out with my dog so much.  kevin rose: exactly. but there's really interesting data around c sections and how not passing through the vaginal canal could potentially harm the baby in that they're not getting a lot of their mother's bacteriaand they're actually getting a lot of the bacteria from the nurses' hands, which is really not a great way to set the stage for your bacteria when you're born.   so it's really data dense, packed with good information and it cites a bunch of studies. i just found it fascinating because i've always had a weak stomach and have recently started supplementing with probiotics, the vsl-3 that rhonda recommends.  tim ferriss: yeah, vsl-3 is good stuff.  kevin rose: it's been a world of difference so i highly recommend the book. it gets a little technical. if you don't know if you'll like it, watch rhonda patrick's podcast, first. but yes, it was eye opening for me.  tim ferriss: cool. my last share will be just a couple of quotes that i've been revisiting because i think they all have applications to my life in 2016. i will share some of them. the first is from henry fordhere's the quote: \"nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.\" so really breaking things down in, to use gtd parlance, the next physical action.ithe next is from george s. patton jr., u.s. army general: \"a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.\" that's another one i think will apply to my life a lot in january specifically, trying to ready, fire, aim in effect. next is charles bukowski, controversial but popular writer. \"unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut, don't do it.\" and i think this applies to me.  kevin rose: that's a great one. i love that.  tim ferriss: yes. that applies to me as far as writing. if you hear something crunching in the background, that's my dog eating a bull pizzle, otherwise known\u00e9  kevin rose: toaster's also running around because daria just got home and he hears his leash and collar.  tim ferriss: that's okay. bull pizzle aside, which is just bowl penis for those people wondering\u00e9  kevin rose: and you actually consume that as well, which is odd.  tim ferriss: i do. if i don't have jerky on hand, bull pizzle will do.  kevin rose: bull penis.  tim ferriss: this applies to me because i get asked a lot, are you working on a new book? and for me, i don't choose to write a book and then write a book. i write a book because i have to get it out of my head. it gets to a point where there's such an incessant obsession with something that if i don't get it out of my head, it's unhealthy and that's when i write a book; when i can no longer keep it inside of me. so there it goes. that's the bukowski   next is, and i'm sure somebody who's listening can give the original, but this is actually a quote from jennifer anniston, but she's quoting somebody else. she says, \"somebody once said - quote - everything you want in the world is just right outside of your comfort zone, end quote.\" i thought that was also very appropriate to a bunch of decisions that i'm nervous about making in the next few months that i shouldn't be nervous about.  kevin rose: that's awesome. these are great to start the new year. i love stuff like this. very inspirational.tim ferriss: james cameron is next, who has not only been an incredible filmmaker but has really been a groundbreaking technologist in the filmmaking world, and outside of film.   so avatar, terminator, etc. and some of his mistakes, actually, like abyss. the abyss was a failure, commercially but they developed the technology that was then used in terminator 2. so quote: \"if you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success.\" i thought that was a good one. can you hear me, kevin? godammit. i'm going to finish without kevin, fuck it. and then i'm going to call him back   so we're back again. i thought this was going to be easy, relaxed.  kevin rose: next time three quotes instead of ten.  tim ferriss: now i'm going to have to edit this goddamn thing. just a few more, because i'm going to push it.  kevin rose: if i drop, just finish without me.  tim ferriss: well, i almost did.  kevin rose: happy new year, everyone.  tim ferriss: exactly. so the next is ray bradbury, 256.   i keep these paginated. here it is. \"don't worry about things, don't push. just do your work and you'll survive. the most important thing is to have a ball, to be joyful, to be loving, and to be explosive. out of that comes everything in you grow.\" so end to be explosive was the reason i included that. i think that massive action, not action, is often a difference of degree that makes all the difference. two more, and then we're done   283. kurt vonnegut jr., one of my favorite writers of all time. \"i want to say as close to the edge as i can without going over. out on the edge, you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center.\" so that's similar to what i've talked about before, the extremes in forming the mean but not vice versa. and the last one is a philosopher named daniel dennett. \"the chief trick to making good mistakes is not to hide them, especially not from yourself.\"    that's it. so become a documentarian of your own life. keep track of those mistakes and share them so you can at least help someone else. but by showcasing your mistakes and analyzing them, i think that's how you very often avoid repeating them. so that's it, manthat's all i got.  kevin rose: love it, good stuff. happy new year. happy new year

were actually talking about investing in startups, is that right", "that's right", "i was talking about no more investing in new startupsi was able to pull the trigger on that in this last year, 2015,

misquotedwhy do i continue to do media interviews", "but it's important for your relevance, though", "you know that", "but i'm not convinced it is, at this point", "because i've spent so much energy

enjoy, which doesn't have to be productive, like binge watching archer, which i've been doing while on the islandit's so fantastic, oh, my god", "or doing something like working on my own content because i feel like i get a better roi", "so that's the type of review that i've been doing", "as i'm reviewing, i'll also make a list based on the things that i loved in the last year, or other ideas of the fun stuff to schedulebecause what i've realized about myself, and i think this is true for a lot of people, is that they don't pre-schedule the fun stuff, like week long trips to abc, or pack trips, whatever it might be - and i have a list of stuff for 2016 that i'd like to do - the work or some type of frivolous bullshit like just sitting on social media will swell to fill the void   it will expand to fill that space", "so that's sort of where i'm goingdo you have anything in particular that you want to do, not just resolutions because we're going to talk about that, like behaviorsbut any new types of trips or experiences", "a lot of that was this last year", "at some point, my wife daria and i are going to have kids", "we've talked about this, tim", "i think that you kind of want to prepare for that and get a lot of these experiences and things that you want to do while you're still young and kidless out of the way", "so i've spent a lot of time trying to knock out that list, travel-wise", "so any time i can do something for work travel-wise, i tend to tack on a couple extra days so that daria can go along with and we can have fun together as a coupleso for example, in a couple weeks i'm heading off to geneva, switzerland for a conference that i need to attend   i'll be there for three days, and then we're going three days early so we get a weekend time and make that a thing; make that a mini vacation", "and then honestly, one of the things i did for the first time this last year that i will do again this year, is take a few days and typically, i do this with a holiday weekend where you have already baked in three days off", "and add on a couple of days on top of that and get a full week and get a staycation, where you just stay at home and really focus on the stuff that you really, really want to do but never actually have time to do", "i'm not talking about chores, but more just personal improvement stuff or things that every single week it gets pushed to the next week", "what are those things for you", "gosh, for me it's around organization and little, dumb things like cleaning off my desktop on my computer", "that feels so good, you know", "getting to inbox zero on one of my personal accountsgetting into the sauna, or starting something new", "i'll talk about the wim hof method, which i know you've interviewed him on your podcast", "i'm now going into week four on that", "that was something i started during my staycation", "very cool", "i want to ask for some help from folks on a couple of things on my list   seven to ten day water only fast; i already did that, which i'll hopefully have some reports on for folks", "did you talk about that anywhere on any of your other podcasts", "no, i haven't really gone into detail", "i did a ten day water only fast", "we've both done fasting in the past", "the most i've ever done is a 24 hour fast", "i did a juice fast of three days; just juice only i'm really curious", "can you give us the quick little rundown of why and what it felt like", "the rundown of why is easy", "there's quite a bit of data in the scientific literature and just empirical from friends of mine who do a lot of work with fasting, a lot of which is unpublished at this point", "but talking to people like dominic d'agostino", "dom d'agostino, for anyone interested in fasting or preventing cancer, ketogenic diet; that's the podcast you want to listen to", "we cover everything", "it appears to be a very effective way to purge precancerous cells", "so if you're over the age of, say, 35 or 40, i think the number i've heard is something like 70 percent of people have cancerous cells that could become potentially problematic later", "it's not so much of a problem that you have mutations that have caused cancerous cells", "it's when they grow out of control or become malignant or metastasize that you get yourself into trouble", "so fasting at this point my personal protocol is i'm trying to do one full day a week, intermittent fasting   i've been doing intermittent fasting for the last 14 days or so because the bahamas are not known for being slow carb or keto friendly", "so i'm having rice for my evening meal but i\u00f4m fasting until about 12 p.m", "or 1 p.m", "and then eating in a six to eight hour window   but the protocol, if we're looking at strict fasting, not the 12 to 18 hour fast, i'm looking at 24 hours a week, one three day fast a month and then one seven to ten day fast per quarter", "i've actually only stuck to the longer fasts once every six months or so because you do pay a productivity penalty", "the trick, if you're doing a longer fast like that, and you should never do it without medical supervision", "ketoacidosis as a diabetic is not the only thing you would have to worry about; there are other things that can go sideways   so you really want to ensure that you have medical supervision if you're doing a longer fast of any type", "i'm going to have some data to share on this but i really want to look through it all", "based on dxa scans and bioimpedance and all sorts of stuff that i tracked, i didn't lose any muscle mass over what was effectively a nine and a half day fast", "there are a bunch of tricks that you could use for that but one of the most important aspects of threading that needle is getting into ketosis, where your body is using body fat as fuel as opposed to glucose - blood sugar - is getting into ketosis as quickly as possible", "because what a lot of folks will do is, say, juice fast or they'll just go full starvation and won't expedite the process of getting into ketosis", "so they have three or four days where they are effectively eating muscle tissue   that's being broken down into amino acids that the liver then converts to glucose through something called gluconeogenesis", "i'm doing a lot of experimentation with this", "dom d'agostino is the guy i rely on, so people should definitely listen to that podcast", "as far as how i felt, i was able to work as much or as little as i wanted", "i did light exercise.ithere were really only i would say, two days out of the nine where i was just a whiney little bitch who wasn't getting anything doneit was a good thing i set parameters for myself so that i wouldn't send off a bunch of really bitchy emails to people and create a mess for myself  i've done a handful of these fasts in the past and i will tell you i tried, like any rookie does when he first gets started with this stuff, i tried a juice fast as my first one", "that was a horrible experience", "yeah, it's the worst", "because you're right", "you don't get into ketosis", "i had to run to the bathroom - you probably know why - just because your gut just explodes into the toilet", "if you're consuming that much fruit juice, you just get disaster pants all day", "it's terrible", "it was really bad", "but then, you were talking about it a little bit and i remember hugh jackman had an interview on 20/20 where they asked him how he gets so ripped to play the role of wolverine   he said, \"the rock actually gave me his secret, and this sounds really silly but it was intermittent fasting.\" he said, \"i intermittent fast", "i go 16 hours fast every single day when i'm shooting the movie and then i eat for eight hours.\" that's what he did", "so i started trying that", "i probably did intermittent fasting, i would say, maybe two months out of last year", "it gets you shredded quickly   so that was a lot of fun and it's a nice little kick in the pants to get you into ketosis faster", "i'm excited to try", "one of the other things that i saw that i don't know if you've seen the study that came out here a couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was a month ago, was this thing called mimic fasting", "have you heard of that", "the fast mimicking diet", "i want to say that's based on longo's research", "why don't you explain for people what that is", "i have some reservations about it but there are definitely people who are  following this protocol", "there was a paper that came out about it that essentially, they talk about the really big benefits and i'm not talking about a flat stomach but more of the stuff that tim was talking about along the lines of anti cancer and some other things kicking in as you get into the longer duration fast so once you're day two, three, and on it's really difficult, though, as anyone will tell you when you do these really long fasts   the idea was that they could mimic fasting by serving you things like really lightweight broths in soups", "so you are still consuming some calories but it's not a ton", "and you have a couple of these little, tiny, broth based meals per day", "your body still goes into the fasting state but it's not as brutal as the traditional, full on just water fast", "i want to say it's less than 400 calories a day, or something like that", "something like that, that's right", "i will say there are some data that would seem to indicate that pure fasting still exceeds the benefits of low or severe caloric constriction in terms of lowering igf-1, and so on", "one could then debate whether lowering igf-1 in fact extends longevity in the same way that you could argue about whether lowering homocysteine decreases inflammation, and there's a lot of debate about both of those", "that's the first thing on the list", "i already knocked it off", "i was going to do that in 2016 but i did it towards the end of 2015 and i'll do it again", "one thing i'd love recommendations for from people listening is i'd like to create some short films", "what i realized is i need to do more things just for the fuck of it", "for instance, hiring people or paying creatives just to make cool shit, without any profit motive whatsoever", "so i can find high endurance creatives to help make, for instance, short films - i eventually want to do some feature film stuff", "when i was chatting with robert rodriguez, i got the idea - or maybe he gave me the idea - of making a few short films", "and i think evan goldberg and seth rogen also said this, so that i could go from start to finish in a micro sense from drafting up the screenplay, so to speak, doing the storyboarding, working with a full team, director, etc   so i think that's something i'm going to do; make a couple of five to ten minute short films", "and if anyone has any particular recommendations for that, i am all ears", "so please just hit us up on twitter, hashtag random show", "while we're at it, kevin, what's your twitter handle", "@kevinrose", "and i am @tferriss because i'm an idiot    other things that i would love recommendations on, i've never been to montreal and i've been dying to go to montreal", "so if people have recommendations for when to go, what to do, hashtag random show, let me know, montreal", "i'm focusing on bodyweight exercises and gymnastics training", "there's a very interesting guy, i think it's chris somers with gymnastic bodies, which i follow on instagram", "i've pinged a couple of my buddies; max shank is another one who's very interesting to check out   i want to focus on doing two moves, and you can google these because it's a bit of a hassle to visualize a planche", "you know what, fuck it", "i'll take a stab at describing it", "so a planche pushup is where you're flat on your hands or on your fingertips, and your legs are spread   you're in a pushup position and your feet are off the ground", "what that means is you have to lean forward so that your shoulders are way ahead of your hands", "so i want to get to the point where i can do a comfortable planch or a planch pushup, and also something called a front lever, which is kind of almost the upside down version of a planch, in a way, but you're hanging from a bar and your body is completely parallel to the ground but you're levitating", "and of course you're connected through your arms to the bar", "so people have recommendations for any particular exercises that have helped them with quantum leaps in progress with either of those, hashtag random show", "let me know", "i would love to hear about it", "i'm looking at the planch pushup right now", "there's now way in hell you're going to pull this off", "you're way too big", "i'm optimistic", "it's like little tiny dudes doing this", "yeah, they tend to be a little small but there are beefier dudes who do it and i'm optimistic", "so i'm going to give it a shot", "i might have to cut off my legs at the knees or lose a lot of quadzilla size in my legs, but i'm optimistic", "so i'm working on that", "it definitely does not help if you have a lot of extra weight in your legs to do either of those things", "so is this one of your new year's resolutions or just something you want to do in general", "i would say it's a new year's resolution", "those are two movements i'd like to stick", "i'd also like to get to the point where i can do a slow - i'm going to fuck up the terminology here and sorry for the cursing, guys", "i got criticized because some people listen to these with their kids", "but alas, from long island; i apologize", "i'd like to be able to do a slow handstand from standing with legs together, knees locked where i just slowly go down to palms on the floor", "and i guess that would be in the pipe position; just go straight up to a handstand and i can lower my feet down, tap the toes and come back up", "i'd like to get to that point", "that sounds doable", "it looks more doable than the planche, yes", "i told you what i've been doing for my core strength, right", "did i mention this to you, the pilates thing", "no, you didn't mention it to me", "it's been three months of pilates twice a week for me", "you can laugh all you want", "no, i like pilates", "hold on", "let me explain", "i hate you", "it's good for your pelvic floor", "are you doing kegels", "you go to the gym, and i walk by the pilates studio and yes, it doesn't typically tend to be very many guys in there", "it's kind of like core strength and all the guys are out there hitting the iron", "i get that", "but you know, i have always had a really crappy coreand for me as a guy, i feel a lot of guys are like this   i would say legs and core are two things that typically get overlooked", "a lot of guys go to the gym, they hit upper body, they hit shoulders, they hit chest", "so i always had a really weak core, and i knew that", "i started to have some back issues this last year so i was like, now's the time to really get serious about my core", "and i did what anyone else would do; those leg lifts at the gym", "and then i was just like, i'm really not getting the results, this sucks", "i don't feel motivated", "it's the last thing i do", "i always kind of do half the reps i want to do   and so i tried a pilates class", "i didn't try the group class", "i went to an instructor so i could get the full on experience", "i found a semi reasonable instructor price-wise and i go twice a week, and it's been amazing", "i would say that i can do things with my abilities i never thought possible", "granted, they're still not showing due to beer and pizza and things of that nature", "underneath the ripples of fat, you're shredded", "underneath there is a ripped nine-pack", "seriously, though, it's a lot of fun because pilates is one of those things that if you have an instructor, there are so many exercises that it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing every time", "it's something like 30 different moves", "so she's constantly changing it up, having me do different things", "she started me at the correct pace where i wasn't killing myself but at the end of every session i'm definitely sweating and i just feel stronger", "so it's been a fun practice for me to add into the tail end of last year", "i think pilates, the strict, classical pilates is fantastic", "it's very similar in a lot of ways to gymnastics training, actually, with a tremendous amount of focus on pelvic tilt and becoming comfortable in different positions and understanding pelvic tilt, and then something called the transverse abdominis   so people can think of that as a corset muscle that runs horizontally across - this is simplified, obviously - but across your abdomen.", "and if you cough or laugh really hard and you get sore in the mid section, that's the transverse abdominis", "when people have really lax or weak transverse abdominis, you notice a lot of things", "and if they have tight hip flexures for a whole host of reasons like not sitting enough, not stretching the hip flexures, not having strong muscles around the pelvis, you see people who have low body fat but look fat when they're just standing there in clothing because they have the hips kind of pouring forward   that makes their gut stick out, and then they have a protruding belling because they have weak transverse abdominis", "pilates is great for that", "i get asked a lot by women, for instance, what should i do for exercise", "i want to look like this person, look like that person", "and they point out very athletic dancers or celebrities, etcinevitably, if they want to keep it simple - and this could apply for guys, too but i do get this question specifically from women a lot - it's pilates and two handed kettle bell swings", "if you do pilates, very classical, technical, unforgiving pilates and kettle bell swings, and let's just say you did that twice a week, like monday, wednesday friday", "monday and friday you do the kettle bell swings, wednesday you do the pilates or vise versa", "you could alternate weeks, even   so it would be like pilates monday, kettle bell wednesday, pilates friday, kettle bells monday, that way", "you can get in fantastic, incredible shape and all you would need to do is moderate carbohydrate consumption with something like slow carb or paleo or whatever", "which i still think is, for a lot of people , more sustainable than intermittent fasting", "i did light up the internet accidentally   i did a little bit of internet arson inadvertently because i put a post on facebook and twitter saying most people who do intermittent fasting are just getting smaller, not leaner; meaning they're losing muscle mass", "that was based on data from a friend of mine who runs a dxa scan facility, which gives you a very good idea of exactly what's happening with your body composition; body fat and muscle", "she said the vast majority of guys, and they do tend to be guys, who come in and do an experiment with intermittent fasting lose a lot of muscle mass   so they lose weight, they're looking at the scale, they think they're doing a good job and in fact they're backsliding because their body fat percentage is going up", "the internet freaked out about that", "but i think ultimately when you're looking at resolutions or making changes in the new year, the good plan that you all follow is better than the perfect plan you're going to quit in two weeks", "so there you have it", "another thing i would like feedback on from people is i'm considering doing live podcasts and traveling around the countryi'll probably do some tests in la first, and then san francisco and new york", "and then i'm thinking about hitting a bunch of lesser known or lesser traveled places like montana, and going on a road trip and actually going around the country", "what are your thoughts on that", "you've done more live shows than i have.i've certainly done a lot of live shows back in the day with dig nation", "when you say live, do you mean audience or no audience", "i mean audience", "i mean actually meeting people and just traveling around the country", "i would obviously test this first in a few places where i'm comfortable and know i can fill seats like la, sf, new york", "but then i'd be doing live audience for sure", "it's chaotic", "i think if you would hire a person or two to help out, to help manage some of the chaos, and then certainly very directional microphones so you don't pick up the entire crowd", "it's a lot of fun and it's good to kind of vibe off the audience and feel the energy when they laugh at certain things you're talking aboutyou can always take live questions or things like that", "why not", "why not experiment", "do it", "i think i'm going to do it in la, first in january or february, so that's coming up soon", "so keep an eye out, folks", "if you have any thoughts, let me know", "if you have any thoughts on venues for like 500 to 2,000 people, and kevin, is there a sweet spot of audience size for you", "i've always enjoyed the slightly more intimate shows", "when you get going into the bigger venues, typically they ask for more money and they charge", "whereas you can go and find nice bars with a small stage that say hey, if you're going to fill this up with people, i'll just give you the space for free", "like beach chalet out in san francisco is one of my favorite spots and we used to do shows out there", "beach chalet", "yeah, it's right out by ocean beach", "they can hold probably 500 people", "i just picked a slow night", "do it on a monday or tuesday night or something and they'll just give you the space", "they set up speakers for us and it was just completely free because they knew they would sell more beer", "coolyou mentioned an app to me that you were finding useful", "i don't know if you want to hold that back for later but i'd like to hear more about it", "absolutely", "along with new year's resolutions comes the need to track all this stuff", "you and i are both very kind of quantified people", "last year, i tracked my alcohol consumption in a google spreadsheet, which was great", "every single day i would color code it", "i wrote a little script so that based on what i typed in, it would change it to either green, orange or red", "and just to be clear for folks, he was trying to beat 30 drinks a week", "that was green", "yes, i was trying to go for at least 50 to 60 drinks per week", "no, it was really eye opening", "because you tend to just think oh, i've got this even tonight, no big deal, let me go have three drinks", "oh, there's an event two nights from now", "my wife wants to crack a bottle open", "and you don't realize not only how many drinks you're having but just the sheer amount of calories you're putting into your body in consuming all this alcohol   so it was eye opening for me", "but it wasn't something that was easy to do on the go, especially when you start layering in other things", "why don't we do this", "i'll give you my quick, little 30 second rundown of all the stuff i'm trying to track", "the name of the app that i'm using that i found is way of life", "and i think by far it is the best habit tracking app out there", "it's really simple to set up", "it creates beautiful charts and graphs out of the data", "you say yes, no, or i skipped it", "you can set up things that are also negative", "so for example, one of the things they have is did i drink over three drinks", "so if i say yes to that, it will actually turn it red instead of green", "so i'll give you my quick list   no", "1 - and these are not in any specific order - watch a ted talk every day", "that's going to be easy", "i subscribe to the ted video podcast on itunes and i'm going to watch one every single day for the entire year", "sauna three times a week", "i want to get serious about heat", "me, too", "ditto", "i've already done it three times this week", "i'm going to skip today but i'm going to go tomorrow", "i alternate a cold bath and sauna", "i found a great place in new york; they have turkish and russian baths   the cold is extremely cold and i go in there, and i can talk about the wim hoff method later, what i'm doing to stay in there for long periods of time", "the third one is two or less drinks", "so i'm trying every single day to consume two or less drinks", "i'm tracking my pilates", "i'm also tracking meditation", "i'm tracking weight lifting; trying to do that three times per week", "i'm tracking no alcohol, so those are days i take entirely off from drinking", "i want to know how many days i'm doing that per month, and you can see month over month progress with this app; it's wonderful   i'm tracking no sugar", "i'm tracking tea consumption", "so out of the last seven days, i've had tea four days", "no coffee", "i am trying to do tea only for a few days", "coffee has been a crutch for me for a very long time so i'm trying to slowly wean myself", "i don't inherently think that coffee is bad for you", "there is a little bit of data if you drink more than two cups, it can increase your homocysteine levels, which i have elevated but that could be because i have that mother fucking gene", "you know what i'm talking about, the mthr", "mthfr gene, or some nonsense like that", "so that could be why", "and then also slow carb", "i'm living the tim ferriss lifestyle", "living the vita ferriss", "when i say slow carb, i tend to mean a little bit more on the keto side", "obviously, that's also slow carb-ish", "i do a kind of modified keto that is a lot more veggie forward", "veggie forward", "sounds like a wine", "mmm, broccoli on the tongue", "exactly", "so that's everything i'm tracking and this app is phenomenal", "that is a lot to track, man", "are you not worried that you're going to flame out because of too many variables", "it seems like you spend a lot of your time inputting data", "the beautiful thing about this app is it's not about typing a ton of notes", "yes, there's a section for that but it's simply yes or no questions", "like did you have alcohol today, and you tap yes or nothen it goes onto the next one", "it's all done in a vertical list of things so you don't have to view any additional screens", "seriously, it sends me a text every night at 10 p.m", "because i set that up in the app", "then i go in there and it takes me all of, i'd say, 30 seconds to input all the data", "and this is the fun thing", "every first of the month, so come february 1st, i'm going to tweet out my results from last month", "that's smart", "it creates a little, tiny spreadsheet for you that you can tweet out, like a little, tiny graphic", "it's going to be fun", "yes, if you force yourself to do that", "although now, people know so if you get to the second of the month, anybody listening, and you remember and you see that kevin hasn't put up his numbers, you can remind him on twitter", "please remind me", "i wanted to underscore something here about resolutions and goals in general; behavioral change", "that is if it's not in the calendar and if you don't have some type of consequence or stakes, you're not going to do it   for instance, i've seen a number of new year's resolutions lists online from fans", "they often say i want to meditate more, i want to drink less alcohol", "not only is that not specific enough, you want to make it measurable", "you want to have some type of quantified goal", "but there's no punishment or real reward for not following that behavior, if that makes sense", "so two things", "get it in the calendar", "so if you say meditate more, and let's say you decide that means you're going to meditate three times a week for one minute in the morning, or five minutes in the morning or before bed, put it in the calendar or it will get crowded out   the second is have either an accountability partner, or put together a betting pool with a bunch of friends", "i talk about this a lot in the four hour chef because it's about accelerated learning", "i'm going to put up an excerpt from that chapter for free for people to check out", "i'll put it at fourhourworkweek.com/stakes, like tent stake, s-t-a-k-e-s", "so fourhourworkweek.com/stakes and i'll put that up", "but you need to have some type of reward or punishment", "punishment generally beats out reward", "i know that sounds funny but the prospect of losing, say, $100 in a betting pool will motivate you more than the possibility of winning $100", "this has been very well researched", "or some type of pubic embarrassment works very well, also", "or being humiliated because you didn't live up to your side of the bargainlike if kevin doesn't put out his numbers and then people give him a bunch of shit on february or march 2nd, that will be a motivator for kevin", "it's a huge motivator", "i'm going to expose all of my drink data and everything else directly online, so i'm excited for that   the other thing i'll add on top of that is i was reading a post, i believe it was a study that was done that talks about when you're trying to form a new habit, try combining it with something you enjoy doing", "have you heard this at all", "so for example, if you're going to the gym and getting on the treadmill for the first time, bring your favorite new series, archer or whatever it may be, and put it on your ipad and watch that while you're working out", "so you're doing something you enjoy", "so for me, i get through serious treadmill sessions at insane inclines  like 2 to 3 degrees", "oh yeah, right", "i'm talking like 8 plus degrees but really slow", "and i'm just drenched in sweat but i'm playing a tower defense game that i love", "so that's my time to game but also get my exercise", "if you're going to meditate, do a shot of whiskey before", "no, i'm just kidding", "don't combine like that", "actually, one thing i do do, if i can make it on a streak for three days in a row with no alcohol at all, i go to the kava bar and i have a full bowl of kava", "it's amazing", "i know, you've told me", "i don't know enough about kava to know whether it's better or worse for you than going without alcohol for three days straight", "let me give everyone the 30 second rundown on this", "basically, there is an herb called kava", "you can go to whole foods or any grocery store almost and buy it in a kind of tea form", "actually, yogi tea makes one on amazon that has five star reviews; almost a solid five starts with 5,000 reviews", "use a couple of those tea bags, soak it for 15 minutes and then drink it like tea", "it puts you in a very relaxed state   it's almost like you've had a couple glasses of champagne but without drinking", "they actually have bars that are popping up over in new york that don't serve alcohol; they just serve kava", "you co in and they give you a bowl full of kava", "it tastes like dirt, and you just kind of down itiand then within 15, 20 minutes you just feel like sinking into your chair and you're totally mellowed out", "get it while it's legal", "a side note for folks, smoking like a hookah pipe is not risk freeyou can down the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes very easily sitting at a hookah bar", "so that is not without its risks", "speaking of chilling out, i want to recommend that people consider picking up the practice of meditation because it is a very cumulatively powerful habit to begin", "it doesn't have to be super woo-hoo or new agey", "i was looking at twitter yesterday, actually", "we both have a friend, bobby goodlatte - is it goodlatte", "is that how you say his last name", "it's just goodlot", "jesus christ", "goodlot, i've never really known because i always hear just his first name   but resolutions for 2016, 1) stick to tim ferriss' excellent slow carb diet for as long as i can bear", "he's used it before so it's not that hard", "2) use headspace or meditate regularly", "there are a couple of different approaches you could take for getting started with meditation", "one was recommended to be by kamal ravikant, a very, very smart and good friend of mine", "and it was very simple", "this actually comes back to your gaming while you're on the treadmill", "so people who don't want to meditate, pick a song that puts you in a good mood   for me, it was \"i'm gonna party like it's 1999\" by prince, because it's hard to take yourself too seriously or be in a bad mood with that song", "you're simply going to sit on a cushion or on a couch with your back against the back of the couch or the wallyou're just going to focus on your breathing to the extent possible for one song", "that's all you're going to do", "you just get into the habit of doing that, and you do it just in the morning", "once in the morning and it's, whatever it is; three minutes long", "if you want to go a little bit further, and even people who meditate regularly without any tools use, for instance, headspace", "you used headspace, didn't you", "yes, for a long time", "i'm actually doing wim hof's meditation stuff now but yeah, i love headspace", "i was on the phone with my sister last night and she was looking to getting into meditation", "the first thing i do is always recommend headspace", "they have this ten days for ten minutes a day", "it's called the \"take 10 challenge.\" if you get through those ten days, you'll be sold; it's amazing", "and to that point just broadly speaking, one of the things i do when i review my calendar for the year and i make my list of things that have had the greatest positive and negative emotional impacts over the year, and i look at them as categories, usually what i end up with is a set of challenges or things you'd like to change in the following year", "and one of the questions that i've tried to start asking is what if it were easy", "what would that look like", "so with meditation or working out, even the term working out is i think a disservice to a lot of people", "because they go to the gym and they want to push themselves after doing, say, no exercise for six months", "so they try to go to the gym for an hour a day for five days", "they miss one of those days and they feel like a failure and then they quit", "it's like, you're setting the bar too high", "what would it look like if it were easy", "one set of kettle bell swings twice a week; start there", "or getting on the treadmill for five minutes, meditating for three minutes   because ultimately, it doesn't matter how effective something is, doesn't matter how efficient something it is; if you don't adhere to it, it doesn't work", "another great one is just 10,000 steps a day with a fitbit", "you can actually lose weight that way", "i have people that have set these 10,000 step a day goals and just use the fitbit to track it", "absolutely", "i think that it's important to realize, and i remember oprah winfrey said this at some point", "she always said, \"i always felt like if i weren't stressed out i wasn't trying hard enough.\" she doesn't feel that way anymore", "and i've realized, especially after conversations with guys like derek sivers who has this story about biking, going for this bike circuit in i think it was santa monicahe would huff and puff and try to break his time record every day, and it was 43 minutes", "he could never break 43 minutes", "it was this long, ten mile track or whatever - i'm making up the distance but something like that   then one day, he's like: you know what, i'm bummed out", "he started wanting to skip the ride because it was just too intense and wasn't enjoyable", "he's like: i'm just going to cruise and enjoy myself this time", "he took the same route and he came back and it was 45 minutes instead of 43", "he's like, what", "all that discomfort, all of that grunting and groaning and just feeling miserable and the only gain was two minutes out of 45", "that was the only improvement", "i feel like for a lot of the things we do, whether that's managing investment, or exercise, or i have a list, here", "i actually did this exercise a couple of days ago where it's like okay, podcast excerpts, audio books, book publication, body weight training, investing, getting entertainment guests on the podcast, crowdfunding, dog training, waking up early", "like what if it were easy", "what would that look like, and actually writing it out", "and it's incredible how many problems you can solve just by not creating problems for yourself in complexity", "what type of health goals do you have for 2016", "any particular health goals or changes", "i think in listening to and getting into rhonda patrick's podcast, the role of micro nutrients in our overall health is just fascinating to me", "i had always been one of these guys who grabs a couple of slices of pizza and yes, tim, i did have some yesterday but that was my last day", "you say that every time", "no, i'm serious", "it was my cheat day, tim", "i never do this", "oh, my god, i never do this", "what i'm saying is in my head, i would rationalize it saying: well, i'm taking my multivitamin", "and that just doesn't get the full spectrum; it doesn't really get what you need", "and so in watching her podcast and understanding a little bit more about what we need to consume to be healthy, i've really upped my vegetable intakeso i'm doing a wide spectrum, wide range of colors in my vegetables and just having one massive salad per day", "i've been doing that for a couple months, now", "i certainly feel a lot better and my skin actually looks better, too", "it's healthier", "you look pregnant", "you have that glow", "i have that glow about me", "so do i", "it's kind of an oily sheen", "i've been eating sardines every morning, having a can of wild planet sardines that i've talked about before.ii will just tell people the way that i use it, and i think i've mentioned this once before, is i'm traveling", "my dog doesn't like to eat dry kibble", "yours doesn't, either", "but if i bring the \"origin,\" is the type of kibble i brought", "i don't use the \"foul\" for reasons i can explain another time", "but i think it's the red label - it sounds like johnny walker - origin", "i will open the can of sardines and then pour the oil on top o9f the kibble and then eat the sardines myself", "that's awesome", "so molly, my dog, is getting the olive oil and the sardine juice", "she was having some dry skin issues, like brittle hair issues and i couldn't pinpoint the issue", "within three days of starting to add the sardine oil to just one meal a day, and i'm feeding her twice a day, perfect coat, skin, everything; completely fixed after three daysyou have to assume on some level, being mammals as we are, that there's some type of corresponding effect in humans", "absolutely", "i wanted to mention a book that i recently read that people might want to check out", "i believe it was mentioned and recommended to me by one of the podcast guests i've had on because it was on this running list of books to pick up", "it's called happy money; the science of happier spending", "the authors are elizabeth dunn and michael norton", "let me read the description: \"two professors combine their fascinating and cutting edge research in behavioral science to explain how money can buy happiness if you follow five core principles of smart spending.\"    now, there are a couple of caveats here", "the first is that this is not a perfect book; there are very few perfect books out there", "i think one of the things you should always keep in mind when you're reading any type of pop science book is asking yourself whenever they have an assertion, asking yourself: is this causation or could it just be correlation", "for those of you who have the four hour body, there's an appendix on good science, bad science and spotting the difference, and that's a worthwhile chapter to read", "but the example i'll give, and you see this in the media all the time where people will say something like, \"people who practice yoga have lower blood pressure, a new study finds.\" and then, they continue to say, \"therefore, you should start doing yoga and it only takes ten minutes a session, three times a week.\"i but if you were to actually dig into the data and you asked yourself, wait a second", "is it causation", "is the yoga actually causing the blood pressure or could it just be correlation", "meaning they're just happening at the same time", "so for instance, maybe they're comparing the blood pressure of people in, i don't know, a hospital in the bronx - i'm just making this up - a sedentary population", "then they're checking the blood pressure of people in the west village who are going to yoga class", "and it's like well, okay", "right, and they're also eating wild salmon several times a week, and also eating salads", "exactly", "there's one group eating at mickey d's and fast food, and the other people are eating at whole foods", "it's like okay, that could be an issue that's confounding everything", "and in this book, there are quite a few places where i think they make arguments of causation where it's probably correlation", "however, that having been said, there are principles and also stories that illustrate the principles, like paying for things in advance   like i mentioned committing to this holiday christmas trip with my family six months plus in advance so you can benefit from the anticipation", "so prepaying for certain types of experiences as opposed to possessions", "they walk through what types of experiences tend to give the greatest emotional and psychological roi   they talk about different types of behavioral psychological studies that someone like, say, daniel gilbert might talk about stumbling upon happiness and how you can use them to your advantage", "it's not only for people with a ton of disposable income", "one could argue that the less income you make, the more important this becomes because you have a fewer absolute number of dollars to spend at liberty, as it were, and the pain of misspending is even greater", "i found this book very useful for this particular point in time, meaning new year's resolutions because you can then say take these different questions that they arm you with, and go through your credit card statement", "and actually make categories of things you want to start to eliminate, minimize, or add in", "i found that to be just a very useful exercise.ithere's tons of information out there about how to invest your money", "but every time you make a purchase, you're investing in some respect", "you're trading money, this wampum for an experience or a possession that you think is going to give you something", "it's a very fast read", "it's also available on audio", "i got it on audible, by the way", "i just downloaded it", "it says 226 pages but i'd say the last 70 pages are notes and references and whatnot,", "so it's really only about 150 pages longyou could read it in a day or two", "it's a very fast read", "so i thought i'd recommend that one, as well", "any favorite books from 2015 that you would recommend people check out", "gosh, i'd have to go back and look at my list", "i've got it all on audible", "oh, one thing before i forget", "and this is the random show so we're allowed to jump around a little bit   you were mentioning canned fish just a few minutes ago", "so next time you're in town, i want to take you to a place in new yorkit's called maiden lane and it is unbelievable", "basically what they've done is they've created a wine bar that serves nothing but extremely high end canned fish, and they have them stacked on the wall", "so you can walk over there and pick out what canned fish you want, and they pair a wine with it and give you cheese with itit is phenomenal   i go over there and i get cod livers, which sound disgusting but are obviously really nutritious for you", "i have cod liver with some cheese and a really dry white wine and it's just a fun place to hang out", "is that after your pilates or before your pilates", "i know you would love it", "what's funny is that you act all tough here but if you came to town, you'd be like oh, cod liver, i love this[inaudible] -  [crosstalk]  are you kidding", "no, totally", "i'd wear my\u00e9 i'm trying to decide what type of turtleneck and skinny jeans i'd bring", "i'd be down, manii'm totally down for the canned fish", "it's easy to travel with, alsoso if you go to a location, and a lot of tropical places are like this", "i shouldn't say tropical", "i should say island cultures have very mediocre food", "because aside from the fish, they have to bring everything in", "it's very expensive", "they're often very onerous excise and import taxes", "so the food quality tends to be pretty lowso in a best case scenario, highway robbery", "so raveling with cans of sardines, i though it would be difficult", "and maybe i'm just an outlier but it made it through with no problem whatsoever", "have you read radical acceptance", "yes", "what did you think", "because i think daria was actually one of the first people to recommend it to me", "it's by tara brock", "i'm looking at audible right now", "oh, you know what", "i didn't read it", "i ended up watching her ted talk", "that's the danger of ted talks", "which is pretty much the same thing", "i think the book is very worth reading", "tara was on the podcastshe's a buddhist teacher and i'm very skeptical always of people who are self described teachers of different faiths or aspects of spirituality because there is a lot of nonsense out there", "tara is absolutely the real deal her dharma talks are incredible,", "but this book, radical acceptance, was recommended to me not only by daria, who is about as non-woo woo as you can get; phd in neuroscience   but at least one or two other scientists recommended it to me, which i thought was very unusual for a book in this genre", "it's in effect how to stop beating the shit out of yourself, or carrying around anger and resentment", "it's very, very good", "i'm just going to read a couple of highlights", "i'm looking at my kindle highlights on my laptop, and i have 60 highlighted passages", "but here are just a few", "i tend to highlight things that either i want to remember or review, or lines that have nice turns of phrase or wording", "here it is", "\"i k new i would never treat a friend the way i treated myself; without mercy or kindness.\" so one of my resolutions that i'm going to then put into a measurable form that i can assess somehow is to treat myself the way i would treat a very close friend", "because i do think i have a habit to really kind of smash my head against the wall and to be very unforgiving to myself   let me find another one", "and i know, kevin, you can attest to the fact that there are a lot of successful - and unsuccessful - but very successful people in silicon valley who could identify with this\"as a friend of mine put it - quote - feeling that something is wrong with me is the invisible and toxic gas i'm always breathing, end quote.\"    i just think that this book is extremely helpful for walking people through the thought process in making subconscious judgments conscious so they can deal with them, so they can somehow fix them", "let me find one more", "i'll give one more example", "this is a story about a tiger that was in captivity in a zoo named mohini that was rescued from an animal sanctuary", "mohini had been confined to i think it was a ten by ten foot cage with a concrete floor for five or ten years   they finally released her into this big pasture", "\"with excitement and anticipation, they released mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late", "the tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life", "she paced and paced in that corner until an area 12 by 12 feet was worn bare of [01:04:00] grass", "\"perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns.\" this is where the review of the 2015\u00e9   okay, we're back after a bahamian internet connectivity interruption", "the power has been going out intermittently for the last three days across the entire island", "the story wasn't that interesting so i will leave it where it cut off and continue", "mrrose, over to you", "yes", "i just have one last thing to say", "you asked me about book recommendations earlier and i couldn't recall lit off the top of my head", "but i pulled up my audible account", "shit", "i lost you, buddy", "can you hear me", "i can hear you, yes", "okay, you're back", "forge ahead.maybe we should just call it a show", "i'd say we're getting close to that point", "we're getting close, okay", "so the last thing i wanted to say was just my book recommendation that i have for the episode", "it's called the good gut, have you heard of it", "no", "is it like wheat belly", "no, this is all about gut bacteria and how they influence your overall health", "this is a pair of scientists that wrote this book that actually rhonda had on her podcast, as well", "really fascinating stuff about how gut bacteria influences health, how animals bring in healthy bacteria so actually having a dog could potentially be a good thing for you", "so letting them lick you on the mouth is not that horrible", "it's a good thing i make out with my dog so much", "exactly", "but there's really interesting data around c sections and how not passing through the vaginal canal could potentially harm the baby in that they're not getting a lot of their mother's bacteriaand they're actually getting a lot of the bacteria from the nurses' hands, which is really not a great way to set the stage for your bacteria when you're born", "so it's really data dense, packed with good information and it cites a bunch of studies", "i just found it fascinating because i've always had a weak stomach and have recently started supplementing with probiotics, the vsl-3 that rhonda recommends", "yeah, vsl-3 is good stuff", "it's been a world of difference so i highly recommend the book", "it gets a little technical", "if you don't know if you'll like it, watch rhonda patrick's podcast, first", "but yes, it was eye opening for me", "cool", "my last share will be just a couple of quotes that i've been revisiting because i think they all have applications to my life in 2016", "i will share some of them", "the first is from henry fordhere's the quote: \"nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.\" so really breaking things down in, to use gtd parlance, the next physical action.ithe next is from george s", "patton jr., u.s", "army general: \"a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.\" that's another one i think will apply to my life a lot in january specifically, trying to ready, fire, aim in effect", "next is charles bukowski, controversial but popular writer", "\"unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut, don't do it.\" and i think this applies to me", "that's a great one", "i love that", "yes", "that applies to me as far as writing", "if you hear something crunching in the background, that's my dog eating a bull pizzle, otherwise known\u00e9  toaster's also running around because daria just got home and he hears his leash and collar", "that's okay", "bull pizzle aside, which is just bowl penis for those people wondering\u00e9  and you actually consume that as well, which is odd", "i do", "if i don't have jerky on hand, bull pizzle will do", "bull penis", "this applies to me because i get asked a lot, are you working on a new book", "and for me, i don't choose to write a book and then write a book", "i write a book because i have to get it out of my head", "it gets to a point where there's such an incessant obsession with something that if i don't get it out of my head, it's unhealthy and that's when i write a book; when i can no longer keep it inside of me", "so there it goes", "that's the bukowski   next is, and i'm sure somebody who's listening can give the original, but this is actually a quote from jennifer anniston, but she's quoting somebody else", "she says, \"somebody once said - quote - everything you want in the world is just right outside of your comfort zone, end quote.\" i thought that was also very appropriate to a bunch of decisions that i'm nervous about making in the next few months that i shouldn't be nervous about", "that's awesome", "these are great to start the new year", "i love stuff like this", "very inspirational.james cameron is next, who has not only been an incredible filmmaker but has really been a groundbreaking technologist in the filmmaking world, and outside of film", "so avatar, terminator, etc", "and some of his mistakes, actually, like abyss", "the abyss was a failure, commercially but they developed the technology that was then used in terminator 2", "so quote: \"if you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success.\" i thought that was a good one", "can you hear me, kevin", "godammit", "i'm going to finish without kevin, fuck it", "and then i'm going to call him back   so we're back again", "i thought this was going to be easy, relaxed", "next time three quotes instead of ten", "now i'm going to have to edit this goddamn thing", "just a few more, because i'm going to push it", "if i drop, just finish without me", "well, i almost did", "happy new year, everyone", "exactly", "so the next is ray bradbury, 256", "i keep these paginated", "here it is", "\"don't worry about things, don't push", "just do your work and you'll survive", "the most important thing is to have a ball, to be joyful, to be loving, and to be explosive", "out of that comes everything in you grow.\" so end to be explosive was the reason i included that", "i think that massive action, not action, is often a difference of degree that makes all the difference", "two more, and then we're done   283", "kurt vonnegut jr., one of my favorite writers of all time", "\"i want to say as close to the edge as i can without going over", "out on the edge, you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center.\" so that's similar to what i've talked about before, the extremes in forming the mean but not vice versa", "and the last one is a philosopher named daniel dennett", "\"the chief trick to making good mistakes is not to hide them, especially not from yourself.\"    that's it", "so become a documentarian of your own life", "keep track of those mistakes and share them so you can at least help someone else", "but by showcasing your mistakes and analyzing them, i think that's how you very often avoid repeating them", "so that's it, manthat's all i got", "love it, good stuff", "happy new year", "happy new year to everyone out there and we'll see you again soon on the random show."]}
