i'm doing pretty good. how are you?  tim ferriss: i'm feeling splendid, especially given this cocktail of adrenaline that you've been feeding me.   hello ladies and germs. this is tim ferriss and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers, whether they are chess prodigies like josh waitzkin, actors and  governators like arnold schwarzenegger, or anything in between, professional athletes; you name it, i want to talk to them because you find that at the very highest level, at the top of the top in each field, and across those fields their  commonalities   and i want to tease out the morning routines, the habits, the favorite books and so on that you can apply immediately to your life to level up. and this episode is now exception. this episode was a very intense episode. my guest is someone who very rarely  does any interviews, jocko willink, j-o-c-k-o. he is a legend in the seal community. he's also 240 pounds or so, 230 to 240 pounds of lean muscle. he would routinely tap out 20 or so navy seals as a workout since he's a brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner at a world class level, and also trains professional mma fighters in his spare time.   but dialing back to the beginning, jocko grew up in a small new england  town, enlisted in the navy after high school and spent 20 years in the seal teams. during his second tour in iraq, he led seal task unit bruiser in the battle of ramadi, which was some of the toughest, most sustained combat in the seal team since vietnam. under his leadership, task unit bruiser helped bring stability to ramadi and became  the most highly decorated special operations unit of the entire war in iraq. jock was subsequently awarded the bronze star and silver star   after that, returning from that deployment, jocko served as the officer in charge of training for all west coast seal  teams, which means he designed and implemented some of the most challenging and realistic combat training in the world. he also spearheaded the development of seal leadership training, and therefore personally instructed and mentored the next generation of seal leaders. in 2010, jocko retired from the navy to cofound echelon front, that's e-c-h-e-l-o-n   never knew how to pronounce that, echelon front, a leadership and management consulting company, which teaches leadership principles learned and proven in combat to help others lead and win. and this is very interesting because you can  view combat in many ways as sort of an exaggeration of many states and situations that one experiences in other areas of life including business. jocko is, last but not least, the author of a brand new book, extreme ownership,  that's the title and we get into what that means. i am really enjoying this book, extreme ownership, subtitle \"how u.snavy seals lead and win.\"    i highly encourage you check this book out. even if you just read the intro and chapters one, six, and 12; even if  you just do that, the book is worth many times the price. so check it out. i highly encourage it. and you can find jocko at echelonfront.com, e-c-h-e-l-o-n, and also on twitter. i am helping train him to use twitter. a lot of these guys, the navy seals and other divisions of the military do not like to be public facing but jocko is going to be on twitter. so @jockowillink, j-o-c-k-o w-i-l-l-i-n-k    and you can probably also check out a photo of this guy, which you have to see. and as always, you can find all show notes, links to everything we talk about at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, all spelled out. or you can just go to fourhourworkweek.com and click on  podcasts. and you can also find all previous episodes. so without further ado, please enjoy this very intense, very insightful conversation with jocko willink   we do get into the weeds, and i implore you, i encourage you to bear with  us if we get into a bunch of military specifics because there are gems throughout this conversation. and even if you only take one or two away, it is well worth the time invested. so thank you for listening and please enjoy.  tim ferriss: okay, we are livecasa ferriss. jocko, welcome to the show.  jocko willink: glad to be here.tim ferriss: thrilled to have you here. looking at your bio and talking to people who know you, the number of topics we could discuss are many and  extremely interesting, but i'll start with this tea. what is this? i suppose it's a pinkish colored liquid that you've been consuming and that you've shared with me.  jocko willink: it's a pomegranate white tea, which i believe hits your  soul pretty well.  tim ferriss: i was surprised because i expected to have low caffeine content. i was like, sure i'll try the tea. it sounds like, with the pomegranate maybe it will help with my cramps or something. and i'm pretty well lit up, for someone who drinks pure tea,  oolong tea, i guess as sort of a veteran of indirect caffeine consumption with leaves, i've been impressed. how long have you been drinking this?  jocko willink: i forget when i stumbled upon it but we used to do some desert training, back when i was in the seal teams, actually when i was running the training on the west coast. i would have to sit through the platoon's briefs as they were getting ready to go out in the field and do a field training exercise. the briefs were about an hour long  and we'd be on three or four hours' of sleep a night for a few days   and so at some point i discovered this stuff, and i would start drinking it when the brief kicked off. and by the time the brief ended, i would have taken copious notes and be ready to get after the platoon commanders  that were trying to give good briefs, and i'd get after it.  tim ferriss: you'd be fired up for feedback.  jocko willink: affirmative.  tim ferriss: you mentioned that you don't normally consume caffeine. is that true?  jocko willink: i do not normally consume caffeine,  no.  tim ferriss: what are some examples of when you do consume caffeine? what's the use of caffeine?  jocko willink: some kind of long drive. even my first deployment to iraq, we did longer patrols in the vehicles and i would have, right in front of my seat so sort of hanging in front of my seat, i'd have a flash bang grenade and then another flash bang grenade, and then a frag grenade, which is the grenade that kills people, and then another frag grenade and then the next three pouches were red bull, red bull, red bull.   so if you're going on a long patrol, and i know it might seem strange that you would get tired, but you would and so you'd crack open a red bull and get after it. and that's the kind of occasions i would save the caffeine intake for.  tim ferriss: we haven't spent too much time together; we've been hanging out and you had an ice tea, i had a couple of coffees. and i feel like i've just belligerently, unnecessarily, punched my adrenal glands for so many years that the coffee pretty much does nothing to mebut you're an intense  guy, which is meant as a compliment. what are you like on three red bulls?  jocko willink: more jocko.  tim ferriss: how did you get the nickname jocko?  jocko willink: actually, my parents gave me that nickname.  tim ferriss: oh, they did?  jocko willink: yeah. my real name is john but ever since i was born, i've been called jocko so that's what everyone knows me as.  tim ferriss: when you,  and of course we're going to talk a lot about your time deployed and training other people, but let's take a look at your physique. so we were introduced through  pete attia, who's also been on this podcast. very funny, very smart guy and he said, you have to ask jock about his weight gain. now, this is not bad weight gain because right now you're about how much, would you say?  jocko willink: 230, 235.  tim ferriss: 230. if you were green, you would be the hulk. you're  a big guy and very fit. when you entered the seals, how much did you weigh?  jocko willink: 174.  tim ferriss: 174.  jocko willink: when i started seal training, i weighed 174 pounds.  tim ferriss: how did that transformation take place? was it just a growth spurt or were you facilitating that with resistance training? how did that come about?  jocko willink: i entered seal training at 174 pounds, and  everyone's seen what seal training is like. it's a lot of pushups, a lot of pull-ups, a lot of dips, running, swimming, obstacle course. i just ate what they fed us, which they feed you a lot. and in the course of seal training, i think  i graduated 185 pounds. and once i was done with that and started getting in seal platoons, we all lifted heavy and wanted to be big and strong so i lifted heavy and ate a lot. i was up to 200 in my first platoon and then after that i got up to about 225    now, depending on what's happening in the fight game and who i'm training with and what they're preparing for, i'll go up to 240, 245 if i need to and then come back down once those events are over. so in other words, if i'm training a guy who's a heavyweight or fighting a heavyweight, then i'll put on some weight so i can simulate that better.  tim ferriss: what type of training would you suggest for people, what type of regiment? what might a workout or a week look like for someone,  let's just say a male, 25 years old who wants to add lean mass?  jocko willink: dead lift and squat.  tim ferriss: dead lift and squat?  jocko willink: i think that's the universal answer, right? does anyone say anything different when you ask that question?  tim ferriss: i don't ask many people but  you have such an incredible range of weight over that period of time that i had to ask. i think that is the right answer. i think the eating is a lot harder than the training, in some respects, at least for me. i'm walking around about 175 right now but  i did, to beat a friend in a bet which didn't even involve money so i'm not sure why i subjected myself to this, but i got up to 215. the eating was the harder component.  jocko willink: i remember being on a deployment on a ship. the food on a ship is not good. you're on a six month deployment on a ship, and i was a seal and when you're on a ship as a seal, you don't have a job other than just to work out. this is especially in the \u00f490s so it was a totally different world, the dry years because there was no war going on. i remember we were all just trying to get huge. i remember getting plates full of chicken mcnuggets of whatever brand they'd serve in the  navy.   i'd be just sitting there at the table after chow was done being served and i'm just looking at these chicken nuggets, and hating them and putting them in my mouth and forcing them down in order to gain weight. so yeah.  stupid.  tim ferriss: stupid but requires dedication and there's something to be said for that.  jocko willink: to use one of your terms, i'm a world-class chicken nugget eater when i need to be.  tim ferriss: let's talk about the mma and then we're going to come back to the military. when did you first get exposed to jiu-jitsu or martial arts?  jocko willink: so i'm on my first deployment in 1992 or 1993  and i'm in guamand there's an old seal master chief named steve bailey. he was kind of known as a bad ass; in fact he was known as a bad assand the reason he was known as a bad ass is because he was a bad ass. so this is pre-ufc no one knows anything. and he has been training for a year or something with the gracies up in torrancehe took a bunch of us new guys and said: hey, does anyone want to learn how to fight? and of course, absolutely  we want to learn how to fight; myself and a couple of the guys.   he was like a high level white belt, maybe even a medium level white belt but it's 1993. no one knows anything.  tim ferriss: it was all new.  jocko willink: he taught us the rear naked choke, the arm lock, how to escape the mount and possibly an americana.  tim ferriss: posting on the chest into straight arm length.  jocko willink: right. so with those moves, and being in the seal teams  it's an environment where there are lots of escalations in a platoon so you're constantly scrapping and wrestling and fighting, and that's part of it. but with these basic maneuvers that i learned,  i could do well and it was bad ass. so that's when i started it. i didn't really have the vision, you know?  tim ferriss: you couldn't see where it would go.  jocko willink: i thought it was a finite thing. i know these seven moves. everyone that's stepped  up to me now i've been able to handle; i'm goodi'm good. and it wasn't until one of my other buddies who was a seal who was in that initial pack with me, a guy by the name of jeff higgs, and he had gotten out of the seal teams and he had just dedicated himself to training ju-jitsu. one day he came to my house, and even when we were both idiots, he came to my house one day and he says: hey, you want to train? and is said,  yeah, absolutely.   so we went over in the grass across the street from my house and he had just gotten his purple belt. so you can imagine a purple belt in 1995.  tim ferriss: unusual.  jocko willink: he was just completely beyond anything i knew. he tapped me out a thousand times and i said hey, where are you training; give me the place, and that was it. i went down the next day and signed up for unlimited classes. i took three classes a day until the present time.  tim ferriss: three classes a day?  jocko willink: i would go during lunch. i'd go to the beginner class, i'd go to the advance  class; i would just get after it.  tim ferriss: who was he training with? do you recall?  jocko willink: fabio santos.  tim ferriss: fabio santos. let's flash forward to the current day. who are the primary teachers you've trained with and what's the current status of your jiu-jitsu and training?  jocko willink: long story short, myself and dean lister, we ended up not being with fabio anymore, and we ended up kind of going out on our own. dean went on his own. i was  an active duty seal so i wasn't a full time jiu-jitsu guy. but i was a full time main training partner for dean. so we left, and we ended up going to a couple different schools and eventually opened a big gym down  in san diego. and dean lister and jeff glover are our primary instructors.  tim ferriss: what's the name of the school?  jocko willink: victory mma.  tim ferriss: victory mma. what was your experience opening  a business as an active seal? how did your military experience help or hinder that?  jocko willink: i'd say it was the typical stuff. hey, okay, let's figure out what the plan is going to be, how we're going to put it together. it was opening a gym  tim ferriss: you weren't building a railroad.  jocko willink: it was a lot less than even planning a regular seal mission in a lot of ways, which again, planning seal missions is no high, intellectual task, either. you've got bad guys; you're  going to go kill them. that's not super advanced. and of course there's technology and timelines and all of that but it's not rocket sciencewe did a good job and opened up a big space and we teach a bunch of jiu-jitsu.  tim ferriss: got it so as far as tactical implementation, not the most complex thing that you've done. what would you put on the higher level end of complexity in terms of things that you've spearheaded  or had to tackle, up to this point?  jocko willink: there's two types of complexity that we could talk about herethere's the actual complexity of the mission, which again, it generally is not going to be super complex. but what is complex is that you're dealing with human beings who have all these variables; emotions and problems and issues and egos. that's the complexity in anything. so from a leadership perspective, that's what i've found to be always the more challenging  thing   that's always the more challenging thing is dealing with people and getting people to conduct operations or carry out missions in a way that is most efficient, most effective, especially when they could get killed doing it. you're asking guys to do things that are  very, very dangerous, where they know they could die. that's what's complex. it transfers over to the business world where it's the same thing. you've got to get a group of people to carry out a mission in the most efficient and effective manner so they both have that in common. i think that is usually the more complex piece, is the leadership of human beings.tim ferriss: sure. it makes me think of cus d'amato, who worked with tyson for so long and really took him to his first world championship belt. he said everyone has a plan until they get hit in the face. and i think when you have something that's very simple on paper, but there are a lot of unknown or uncontrollable variables, the  plan is just a starting point. but then you have to adjust in the field. and obviously when the stakes are as high as they are when you're deployed, i can see how that would be infinitely complex, potentially, depending  on how sideways things go. how did you become a seal? what's the story of you becoming a seal?  jocko willink: i grew up in new england, and i actually grew up in a little town in the sticks of new england. i was kind of a rebellious  kid. in fact, i was a pretty significantly rebellious kid. and i know it seems counterintuitive but when you grow up in new england, one of the most rebellious things that a human being can do is join the military. and almost the ultra rebellious thing you can do   i grew up with a bunch of hippies. the kids were hippies, they were deadheads, they were smoking pot and i was not into that. so they thought they were rebellious because  they were smoking pot and doing acid and whatnot. and i don't know, you tell me who was more rebellious because i ended up becoming a commando for my whole life.  tim ferriss: i think the pot and hacky sack scene, i've spent a lot of time in vermont and new hampshire.  jocko willink: exactly.  tim ferriss: that seems kind of par for  the course. it's like sort of conformist rebellion. what was the path that you took? at what point did you enlist?  jocko willink: it  was 1989 and the invasion of panama happened. four seals were killed there. when i saw that in the paper, i was, i guess the word would be ashamed that i was not there. the vietnam war was over so we weren't seeing headlines all the time. and all of a sudden there are guys who were dying for our country and i was not there. right after that, i went down to the recruiting station and said i wanted  to be a seal.  tim ferriss: what happens after that?  jocko willink: i went to boot camp, which was navy boot camp. i got done with boot camp\u00e9! tim ferriss: boot camp is separate from bud/s?  jocko willink: it is separate. and then you go to a school where you learn a navy  trade, and then you start bud/s. i started bud/s in april of 1991so this was right after the gulf war. from my perspective, leading up to the gulf war there were some reports;  i remember hearing them on the news. they were saying there were going to be 40,000 casualties in the first 24 hours. i don't know if you remember that, but i remember that.  tim ferriss: i don't remember that.  jocko willink: i remember that because i was in the military and i was going to seal training.  tim ferriss: i was in china when i saw the announcement on television.  jocko willink: so here i am thinking i'm going to go to warall these guys are going to get hurt, injured, killed and i'm going to go to war. the war kicks off and 72 hours later it's over, and i hadn't even started seal training yet. i  was pretty bummed out. i know that sounds crazy but i was pretty bummed out because that's what i wanted to do with my life was be in combat and be some kind of warriorand now the chance had just dissipated in 72 hours.   but  it was the reality of what was happening. so i went to seal training, went through and went over to seal team one.  tim ferriss: and in boot camp, let's just say for people listening and myself, quite frankly, who are not familiar with what happens in these different phases,  what is the objective of boot camp in the case of the boot camp that you attended, and then bud/s, for instance? because i think a lot of people are familiar with the term and they think of bud/s as a disqualifying phase. the objective is to weed out the people who aren't suitable for combat or leadership or fill in the blank. what are the objectives of boot camp?  jocko willink: boot camp is to turn  a civilian into a military human. they teach you all this basic stuff. i'd say the key thing they teach you in navy boot camp is attention to detail. so you've got to do all these tasksif you're in the navy, you're working on an aircraft and if you make a mistake working on the aircraft, people die. so  it's very attention to detail oriented, and they just teach you the basic structure of the military and imprint that on your brain. and then seal training is what you said it is; it's weeding people out.  tim ferriss: of  the, say, incoming - and i apologize; i'm going to massacre the terminology here. but of the incoming class, how many people go into bud/s and how many people make it out the other end?  jocko willink: it's about an 80 percent attrition rate.  tim ferriss: 80 percent attrition. so 20 percent make it through.  jocko willink: yes.  tim ferriss: do you have to ring a bell? is that an actual thing?  jocko willink: yes.  tim ferriss: how does that work? could you describe it?  jocko willink: they have a bell, and if you want to quit, you can quit at any timeand if you want to quit, you walk over to this bell that they carry on all the runs and  they have in the back of a truck. if you want to quit, you go over and ring the bell and then you're done.  tim ferriss: and then you're done. what did you find most challenging personally in the bud/s training, if anything?  jocko willink: the thing with bud/s is  i was not good at anything. i wasn't great at anything. i couldn't run fast, i couldn't swim fast. but i was okay at everything, which is actually better.  tim ferriss: you didn't have a single failure point.  jocko willink: i didn't have these areas of huge weakness. now  again, believe me i'm not saying i was great at anything, because i really wasn'ti finished middle of the pack on a run, in the middle of the pack of a swim. there were some guys, a couple of guys i remember who were at the other end of the spectrum. we had a guy who played college, ncaa water polo, and he was a phenomenal athlete and he quit because he couldn't get through the obstacle course.   i had another guy in my class who was an olympic gymnast alternate, and he quit because the water,  doing the stuff in the water got to him. so for me, luckily i grew up on the water, i grew up in new england so i was used to the cold; that didn't do anything to me. all you had to do was get to passing and put out as hard as you can like for the runs, i had to run as hard as i could to pass the runs. it was a sprint!  because you couldn't modulate. you didn't know how long the runs really were. they'd say they were four miles but you had no idea what they were actually going to be so you just had to run as hard as you possibly could. that's what i had to do.  tim ferriss: right that's got to be quite a mind trip, to start a run when it's not a primary strength and know you have to go all out without having any idea of the length of the run.  jocko willink: you'd know it was going to be around four miles. i don't want to make it sound like we had no idea. but it would be four and a half miles, four and three quarter miles, whatever.  tim ferriss: did the people who made it through, the 20 percent who made it through bud/s, did the people  who showed the most promise in bud/s end up performing best in the field?  jocko willink: not necessarily because bud/s is a much more athletic eventit's about athleticism, a lot of it. a lot  of it is also don't quit. i hear some people say everybody thinks about quitting during seal training and i absolutely did not think about quitting at any time. there was nothing\u00e9  they could have killed me and it would have been fine  but i definitely wasn't going to quit.   but when you get to the seal team, yeah, there were some guys who were studs athletically but they were not great seals when they got to the teams. and there are also guys who are studs athletically who were studs in the seals teams. it's hard to put a scientific answer around that one.  tim ferriss: we'll come back to the training because i love talking about any type of commonalities or patterns that you've spotted in a couple of different areas i'm going to ask you about the battle of ramadi but i want to first ask, where did you get this mental toughness, this not thinking of quitting even if it killed you? was that developed through athletics  as a kid, through something else? is your entire family like that? where did that come from? where did that drive and stick-to-itiveness come from?  jocko willink: i'm not 100 percent sure. some of it, i remember my dad  was definitely \"you're not allowed to quit at anything, ever.\" so that leaves a mark. also, i think i grew up and i started listening to hardcore music, and i had a hardcore attitude. and so i think that growing up under that influence, that and watching war movies and a product of that influence, of those mantras that you'd hear in some hardcore song  that's about getting after it. i think that left a mark, as well.  tim ferriss: could you describe the battle of ramadi and explain what that is for people who may not even recognize the name ramadi?    jocko willink: ramadi is a city in western iraq, in a province called al anbar province, which is the largest province in iraq. ramadi is the capitol city the battle of ramadi that i fought in was in 2006. at that time, many of the insurgents had been pushed out of bagdadmany of them had been pushed out of fallujah because the marine corps did a very substantial effort through fallujah and cleared it out, and a lot of the enemy had gone to ramadi. in the summer of 2006, the epicenter of the insurgency was in ramadi. that's where  my seal task unit deployed to and that's where we fought.  tim ferriss: how long were you there?  jocko willink: we were there for six months.  tim ferriss: for six months. how would you describe that experience to people? i know that's  a very broad question but for lack of a better way to approach it, because we can really peel back the layers but when people ask you what was that like, how do you answer them?  jocko willink: for one thing, it was my second deployment to iraq. my first deployment to iraq  was completely different, in that the insurgency hadn't been really, truly established yet. this is 2003, 2004 so and so we were doing very well, at least everyone thought we were, and we were winning. i always talk about that deployment like we were rock stars. because 1:00 in the morning, we'd drive out of the gate and go capture a bad guy  and bring him back at 3 in the morning and it was like we were rock starts. we had such a tactical advantage over the enemy. it was just pretty easy   we always worked  in seals only. it was just easy. tough, of course; i shouldn't say easy but it was less challenging. on that deployment, it was like we won  everything and we felt great. we felt great about what we did. we felt like we accomplished our mission. and if those were the challenges of combat, as an individual i felt like i did a good job.  tim ferriss: right, you were well equipped.jocko willink: i did a good job and my platoon did a good job; we did a good jobit seemed like we past a test, you know? because at that time, we hadn't had sustained combat operations for a long time in the seal teams. so we felt pretty bad ass.. so now you fast forward to ramadi in 2006. it is completely different. there are insurgents that actually control a majority of the  city. they have complete freedom to maneuver. they are terrorizing - and i don't use that term lightly - they are terrorizing; they are skinning people alive, they are beheading people   they're doing what you see on tv right now with isis. they're  doing that. the civilian population is horrified. there are 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day in the city of ramadi. route michigan, which is a road that ran from east to west through ramadi, which was loosely controlled by americans, would have seven to ten ied attacks a day. so this is statistically the most ied'd road in all of  iraq and it's three miles long.  tim ferriss: improvised explosive device?  jocko willink: improvised explosive device. so these are roadside bombs that completely caused the majority of casualties in the war in iraq and so we get there, the buildings are rubbled out. the buildings have bullet holes in them. there are wrecked vehicles on the streetthere are giant craters in the streets from ieds   and on top of all that, on an almost  daily basis you're going to some kind of a memorial ceremony for an american soldier or an american marine who's been killed in combat. we rolled into that and right away i knew this is a completely different situation and we are going to fight a completely different type of battle here.  tim ferriss: in this case, looking at your opponents, were they better trained? or did they j just have a territorial and movement advantage that made it more difficult for you guys?  jocko willink: they had both. there was a former iraqi military  base so you had a lot of former regime people there, former soldiers that were there. they definitely controlled the terrain, without questionthey were allowed to fight in a completely different way than us and by that, i mean they have no rules. so you're fighting against someone who has no rules, and they don't care about collateral damage. we are very careful about collateral damage. they don't care.  tim ferriss: just to define that, you mean taking out civilians?  jocko willink: civilian casualties means nothing to them. destroying a building means nothing to them. killing each other, so accidentally shooting or suicide bombers. there  were suicide bombers on the regular in ramadi. so they have no rules. that gave them an advantage, as well. tactically, they did what we did. so for example, if we get into a bad firefight, we'll  call for reinforcements, reinforcements would come to help us. we would watch them do the exact, same thing. if we had someone get wounded, we would call for a casualty evacuation   they'd come and pick them up and take them back to the field medical facility. we would watch them do the exact, same  thingthey had communications, they had plans. they would hit with complex attacks that would be coordinated throughout the city. so at one time, they would attack three or four different coalition outposts in the city or on the outskirts of the city all coordinated not only amongst them selves, so the separate attacks would be coordinated but the individual attacks would be coordinated where they were vicious.    usually starting with machine gun fire, and then rocket propelled grenades,  and then their goal always was to get a suicide vehicle, a suicide vehicle bomb and drive it right into the compound and detonate and kill as many people as possible. and they did this on the regular.     tim ferriss: what was your unit on this?  jocko willink: seal team three, task unit bruiser.  tim ferriss: how many people were in that unit?  jocko willink: in that unit you've got about 35 seals, and then  we have another 70 support people. so these are people who help us fix our vehicles, get our intelligence, man our radios and all that. so you've got a pretty big contingent of support people. they're not seals; they're seal support.  tim ferriss: got it. so roughly 100, 105 people in total?  jocko willink: yes.  tim ferriss: did those 35 seals, did they all directly report to you?  jocko willink: of those 35 seals, there are two seal platoons  with 16 guys each. then we have a small headquarters element; myself and a couple other guys.  tim ferriss: got it. and that was the most decorate special operations unit in the iraq war?  jocko willink: it was.  tim ferriss: what  separates a good commander from a great commander in an environment like that?  jocko willink: out of the gate, my immediate answer is humility because when you're in a situation like that, there's no way that you know everything. it's just not possible. and so you have to be humble enough to reach out, ask people for advice. there had been conventional units, so big army units on the ground for years. and when we got there, there had been a unit on the ground, the 228 iron soldiers from pennsylvania - i'm just giving them some props right now because they  were awesome   and they'd been on the ground for 14 months, fighting. we went to those guys and we said okay, how can we help, what can we do, what advice do you have for us? we wanted to learn what they knew. i think  that was a big piece of it. and also, i had an open mind when it came to the strategic mission that we were trying to accomplish. because for many years, what seals and special  operations and the conventional units were doing was going out in the neighborhoods, grabbing bad guys and coming back to their bases   after three years of that, the enemy attacks had gone up 300 percent so clearly something was not working. the brigade that came in and took over - gain, i'm going to give some huge compliments to the 11ad under colonel sean mcfarland. they came in with an amazing strategy which was seize, clear, hold, and build which meant you've got these bad neighborhoods that are owned by the enemy. and okay, we're going to go in there and we're going to stay there. and that was a very different strategy than anyone had used.  tim ferriss: that's the seize.  jocko willink: that's the  seize, clear, hold and build. so you go into these enemy territories and you actually take over a building, or two buildings or three buildings, and you make them your house; make them your fort. so that's what we did. from my perspective,  for colonel mcfarland and the rest of the battalion commanders and all those commanders to have this open  mind to try out a completely new strategy, which was very, very dangerous\u00e9  tim ferriss: very dangerous. i'm not an expert; that sounds very risky.  jocko willink: it was extremely risky and a huge price was paid. the casualties were very significant and very horrifying.  tim ferriss: despite that overall, was that an effective strategy?  jocko willink: it absolutely was.  tim ferriss: that was just the  price that it exacted?  jocko willink: it absolutely was. by the time i left, we hadn't seen the results of the strategy yet. i left october 21, 2006 and there were still about 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day about five months after we left, the enemy attacks were down to one a day, two a day.  tim ferriss: from what was it previously?  jocko willink: from 30 to 50.  tim ferriss: wow.  jocko willink: and then six months later, it was down to one a week, and then one a month and soon, by 2007, ramadi was the safest place in iraq, excluding maybe the kurd controlled area up in the north.  tim ferriss: do you attribute that to anything else outside of this strategy, the seize - i apologize for forgetting the others - occupying these buildings or areas and making them your home for a period of time; were there other tactical decisions or strategies that contributed to that decrease?  jocko willink: obviously,  the other huge piece of this was the men and women who were fighting, and god bless them all because it was a hell of a fight. like i said, there were significant casualties. and the  other focus now was to take back the neighborhoods. and in that, secure the populous. in other wars, you say okay, here's our strategic objective; it's to take this hill or take this airfield  or what have you. in this one, the strategic goal was to secure the populous, to make sure that the populous was safe!  because once the populous was safe, then it was okay, now we're going to give you some food, we're going to give you some waterwe have iraqi troops with us; we worked all the time with iraqi troops and they're speaking the same language. it took a very short amount of time before that barrier got broken down and the local populous of ramadi turned against the insurgents because they no  longer feared them. so that was the other huge tipping point, getting the local populous of ramadi on the side of the coalition.  tim ferriss: i imagine that would give you an enormous informational advantage, also.  jocko willink: absolutely.  tim ferriss: it sounds like  you have humility and openness to modifying preexisting strategies. but then there's also an experimental piece, it sounds like. how was the first  experiment conducted, or how did it come to pass and be implemented that you would go in and occupy and test out that particular approach? were there other experiments like that?    i know i just asked two questions but i'm just trying to figure out in a military structure, and i haven't been exposed to that, where i'm sure there's a lot of command structures in place; were you given a lot of latitude to experiment in that way?  or did it require a lot of process?  jocko willink: i'll try and give a concise answer.  tim ferriss: it doesn't have to be concise.  jocko willink: but you're going deep right now, which is fine because it's your podcast. i'll take it back  to a place called al-qa'im, where the marines did a big sweep through al-qa'im and at some point when they went through al-qa'im, the local populous started saying hey, there's bad guys over there. hey, there's bad guys in that building down there; go get them, too. so there was a little  thought about that    now there was a place north of ramadi called tal afar, which there's a great, legendary army commander, nick masters - and i've got to look that up because i think i'm missing it.  tim ferriss: that's okay. people in the show notes, they can also do some research.  jocko willink: h.c. mcmaster, the guy is a legendary guy. he ran the seize, clear and hold strategy up in tal afar and it was very effective. and again, this is pre-surge. that  was 2005, 2006. colonel mcfarland went and took over for him in tal afar, and got the turnover and understood what had happened. and then colonel mcfarland got the task once mcmaster left to come down  to ramadi. and he said i'm going to do the same thing there. and so that's what he did.    one thing that's interesting is that it's not a  movie, and so everything was not perfect. you'd push into some of these neighborhoods and it was fierce, fierce fighting and you know you take casualties. i think that colonel mcfarland understood that deeply and he also had a vision for what the victory was going to look like. those pieces and pushing in, the first time it was like hey, here's what we're goin to do. we're going to go into this neighborhood that's controlled by the insurgents and move in    tim ferriss: in a battle such as ramadi, how do you define objectives in the longer term, not necessarily  on a nightly basis but in the longer term so that you can focus the efforts and sustain the morale, for that matter?  jocko willink: that's actually a simple question. okay, here's what we're going to do. three days from now, we're going to go into this neighborhood. we're going to establish a combat outpost,  and that's what we're going to focus on for the next three days. and once we get that thing established, guess what? we're going to spend four or five days there and then we're going to do it againgrand picture, strategic vision, here's what it's going to look like   we're going to have combat outposts all over ramadi that are going to be controlled by americans with iraqi soldiers with them who can go out and talk to the local populous and we can secure this city. it was as simple as that. now, you take that down a level to, let's say, one of my seal platoons and they'd be saying: okay, here's what we're going  to do. we're going to go and take this particular building, and then we're going to cover for the conventional units as they come in in a very exposed way   because when you build these combat outposts, you're literally doing a construction project in the middle  of a combat zone. so these guys, these brave army engineers are standing with a hammer in their hand, full body armor, reinforcing these buildings, loading sand bags,  building barricades. this is while we're being attacked. and so those guys, like i said, i can never give enough credit to the units that we worked with there in ramadi. they were phenomenal and brave. what we would do is while they were doing those missions building out those combat outposts, we would go out to the high ground surrounding the combat outposts   so we'd sneak out into the areas surrounding the combat outpostso now when the enemy  came to attack the combat outpost, we would kill them. and they didn't know where we were in the beginning. eventually, they'd figure out where we were and come attack.  tim ferriss: what was the d jocko willink: of expertise like among the 35 seals under your command, and again, i have to apologize because what i know of seals, some of it has come from guys  who have been deployed who are friends of mine but a lot of it comes from seeing films. it's a lot of the exposure that civilians have here. and some people say yeah, that guy's a door kicker, this guy's this, this guy is that. how did the responsibilities break down across those 35?  jocko willink: it's two seal platoons. each seal platoon has a single leader who's in charge of the whole platoon, and he's got some subordinate leadership underneath him. and then you've  got these guys who have their specialty craft, whether they're snipers, whether they're medic guys, corpsmen, whether they're breachers, which are guys who blow things up, blow open doors, riflemen, grenadiers, point  men. so you've got these various skill sets inside.  tim ferriss: i apologize; what is the riflemen and then what was the other?  jocko willink: grenadier.  tim ferriss: are they the same?  jocko willink: it depends. a rifleman is basically a guy with a rifle, which we generally wouldn't  have because almost every guy in a seal platoon is doing something other than just shooting his gun. like i said, he's a radioman so he's calling in for fire, calling tanks, calling casualty evacuation; anything like that. the sniper is being a sniper. the machine gunners are machine gunners. a grenadier lobs grenades at people. that's what a seal platoon isinow, the experience level in the seal platoon is you've got guys who have never deployed before, and  we had probably out of 30 whatever guys, we probably had a dozen who had never deployed before. so this was their first deployment to iraq. it was pretty epic, first deployment to iraq. and then you've got guys  who have varying level of experience inside the platoons. some guys had deployed to iraq one, two, or three times. that's probably the level of experience.  tim ferriss: what  were the sizes of groups that would go out on, say, a nightly raid or something like that? and again, i apologize. i'm playing the civilian role here so i'm not going to get everything right. but would the core group be like a six or seven\u00e9?  jocko willink: we would task organize depending on the mission. it's important to remember we were working with iraqi forces. so we had these other people with us that we could use as bodies to do some of the work we'd send six, seven, eight, nine, ten seals out with eight, ten, 12, 20, 40 iraqis and it's the whole spectrum because sometimes we'd send an entire seal platoon out,  16 guys with 40 iraqi soldiers or 50 iraqi soldiers. and sometimes we'd send five seals out with five iraqi soldiers to do some kind of an over watch position, a little smaller. but we still had a minimum that we needed to take out.  tim ferriss: what is an over watch position?     jocko willink: over watch position is what i talked about earlier where you get the high ground, or maybe not necessarily the high ground but often the high ground. that's the tactical advantageous position on the battlefield is to be on the high ground.   tim ferriss: who are other people in the military, alive or dead, u.s. or elsewhere who you really respect as strategists or tacticians?  jocko willink: obviously,  i talked about colonel sean mcfarland, who was just fantastic. and i don't know if i'm necessarily right on this but general petraeus, who wrote the manual on counter insurgency, so he's  obvious and he orchestrated the surge and he's brilliant. and in my opinion, he was the critical player in really turning the rest of the war. again, we were pre-surge but i think they used the  success in ramadi as a reason to sell the surge. like we can do this in other places; we did it in ramadi. so from my perspective, both of those guys were just outstanding.  tim ferriss: the reason i was asking about the smaller groups that are sent out, the eight to ten seals with the iraqi colleagues, what distinguishes  a good leader in that type of situation or in bud/s or elsewhere? what have you observed and learned about what makes a good leader versus a good or a mediocre or a bad leader?    jocko willink: again, the immediate answer that comes to mind is humilitybecause you've got to be humble, and you've got to be coachablewe would fire guys. later, when i was running training, we  would fire a couple leaders from every seal team because they couldn't lead. and 99.9 percent of the time, it wasn't a question of their ability, it was a question of their ability to listen and their ability to step outside and see that maybe there's a better way to do things. so that's number one. and number two i would say is an individual who is balanced   there's a phrase that i use, the dichotomy of leadership. so in  a leadership situation, you're constantly balancing these opposing forces. do you have to be aggressive? absolutely. can you be too aggressive? yes, you can. do you need to be courageous? yes, you do. can you be foolhardy  and get people killed? absolutely. so there's all these balances. can you be too close to your men? yes, you can. can you be not close enough? yes, you can. can you be too robotic? yes, you can. can you be too emotional? absolutely    what i find the best leadership, they have this ability to balance all those opposing forces. and usually, when you do find a problem, if you realize that your leadership isn't working, generally you can look and say i'm going too far in one direction on this particular force, this dichotomy of leadership. i'm going too far. i'm being overbearing. i'm micro managing. micro managing is a great one, right? you can obviously micro manage your people  and they won't do anything on their own; they won't take any initiative and that's horrible   the other end is you cannot give them the guidance that they need and not pay close enough attention to them, and now they don't know what the mission is or what they're doing. so there's  all these dichotomies that you have to balance as a leader. and i think that between being humble and balancing all those dichotomies of leadership is what makes a good leader.  tim ferriss: how would the ability to listen and be coachable,  what would be an example of how that manifests itself? just how you would observe that and say that's a guy who's good at being humble and coachable, or the opposite. i'm looking for the things that you would observe or hear, where you'd be like, you know what, i think we might have to let that guy go.  jocko willink: again, now we're going back to training. we put these guys through very realistic and challenging training, to say the leastand i know if there are any guys who went through training when i was running it, right now they're chuckling  because it was very realistic, psychotic. we put so much pressure on these guys and overwhelmed them. a good leader would come back and say i lost it, i didn't control  it, i didn't do a good job. i didn't see what was happening   i got too absorbed in this little tiny tactical situation that was right in front of me. either they'd make those criticisms themselves about themselves,  or they'd say what did i do wrong? and when you told them, they'd nod their head, they'd pull out their notebook, they'd take notes. and that right there, that's a guy who's going to make it, who's going to do it right.   then you get the guy who comes in and you'd say what did you think of the operation? and if it was a disaster, he'd say it was a disaster. and you'd say, what went wrong? and immediately it's my assault team leader didn't do x, and my mobility commander  didn't do y. and i told those guys i wanted them over there and they didn't go there.  tim ferriss: finger pointing.  jocko willink: immediately finger pointing and that's just a telltale sign that you've got a guy who's not humble enough and coachable, and it's  an awful thing. you can try and change people, and sometimes they would change but it's difficult to get them to change. some people are born with that characteristic and it's a bummer to see. if you can't fix them, you can't fix them, and they're not going to listen to anybody.  tim ferriss: it sounds like  self-awareness is also a big component of that, to have the awareness to kind of step outside and objectively evaluate yourself.  jocko willink: i call it detachment. that's one of the things that early on in my leadership career, i actually remember when it happened. i was probably 22 or 23 years old. i was in my first seal platoon we're on an oil rig in california doing some training. we come up on this level of this oil rig and we've never been on an oil rig before. they're very complex. there's gear and boxes and just stuff everywhere on these levels,  and they're see through. you can see through the floors. it's a complex environment   we come up and we all get on this platform on this level, and everybody freezes. i'm kind of waiting, and i'm a new guy so i  don't really feel like i should be doing anything. but then i said to myself, somebody's got to do something. so i just did what's called high porting my gun. i lifted my gun up towards the air, like i'm not a shooter right now. i took one step back off the line and looked around and i saw what the picture was. and i just said hold left, move right   and everybody heard it, and they did it. and i said to myself, hmm,  that's what you need to do. and so i realized that detaching yourself from the situation\u00e9  tim ferriss: so you can observe it.  jocko willink: \u00e9 so you can see what's happening is absolutely critical. and now, when i talk to executives or mid-level managers, i explain to them that i'm doing that all the time. it sounds horrible but it's almost like sometimes i'm not a participant in my own life. i'm an observer of that guy who's doing it. so if i'm having a conversation with you and we're trying to discuss a point, and i'm watching and saying wait, are you being too emotional right now? wait a second, look at him   because i'm not reading you correctly if i'm seeing you through my own emotion or ego. i can't really see what you're thinkingbut if i step out of that, now i i can see the real you and if you are getting angry, if your ego is getting hurt, if you're about to cave because you're just fed up with me. whereas if i'm raging in my own head, i might miss all of that. and so that detachment that takes place as a leader is critical, and you're 100 percent right on that.  tim ferriss: how do you instill or try to teach that? i feel like that may be more than the humility. it seems to be a coachable skill. part of the reason i say that is because i've found that whether it's cognitive behavioral therapy, or stoic philosophy, for that matter, you can, in small increments, condition people to have less of an extreme emotional response, to try to observe themselves. and i suppose there's some buddhist thought that would translate to that, as wellhow do you help teach someone that ability to detach?  jocko willink: what we did to teach them was put them under extraordinary pressure where to fail to detach from the situation and step up and away from the problem would result in failure. i had a great experience where the guy who actually took over my job as the troop commander, a very close friend of mine. he was going through the training and i was running the training. we were going out to a place called niland, california to do land warfare   and again, this is desert operations. you're patrolling in long distancesyou're hitting targets. we have high level laser tag guns that we use to shoot. we put a lot of pressure on people. there are helicopters, there's smoke, there are bombs, there's all kinds of stuff happening. and this guy, this buddy of mine, he was supposed to be commanding it all but he had broken his neck about six weeks prior to this.  tim ferriss: was that on like a ropes course, or coming out of a helicopter?  jocko willink: he was climbing the ship and the guy above him fell and he broke his neck. so this guy, who had been in ramadi with me  and did an outstanding job and amazing effort, and was brave to a fault; we're lucky he's here. the land warfare  training takes place, and i said hey, just come out and watch with me. so he comes out and we're watching, and we're out on one of these field training exercises   so all this mayhem starts. there are bad guys up in the hills, bombs are going off, and there's  smoke everywhere. but from our position, which we were standing next to the guys who were in it, and he looks at me and says it's so easy when you're to in it. and i said, this is how it was for me when we went through. i was up here. and it was like a light bulb went off. he was like, i saw youhe kind of saw me like that and said how does he know what's happening right now?  tim ferriss: so easy insomuch  as when you're the outsider looking in, you can see what to do; what's going on.  jocko willink: exactly.  tim ferriss: and when you did it, you were not necessarily physically removing yourself but mentally pulling the perspective back so that you could observe it. so if you take someone like your friend  who has this realization, like holy shit, okay, that explains a lot. if you could create this perspective, you would have a huge tactical advantage. what type of exercise would  you put someone through where the consequences were so significant that they would be forced to detach in that way?  jocko willink: these are just exercises that we'd do. and like i said, we would use lasers. we had this advance laser tag system where you can get shot at 300 meters. if you get shot at niland and your beeper goes off and says you're dead, then you're dead. you're going to have to get carried out by your buddies, which is awful, and they're going to get hurt, sprained ankles and everything else; it's a nightmare. and also now they can't maneuver as well   so now what happens when they get attacked again, which they're going to because it's going to be murphy's law out there and the problems compound. and if the leaders get bogged down  in those problems and don't step back, we would kill all of them. and they'd come back with their heads down and say, what the hell just happened and what can we do better? and we'd have this talk with them.  it's one of those things. it's like when you're growing up and you don't listen to anybody   not that you don't listen, but some lessons you have to learn through life and experience. and so that happened. guys at varying levels, some of them would be able to say i just saw it; okay, now i can make this happen. and that would happen, as well, where i could see\u00e9 like in terminator, at the beginning they said. \"on august 27, 2016,  the machines became aware.\"    you could see their leadership switch happen, and all of a sudden they'd go boom. and then i would know my job was done. they'd step up, they'd take a step back from the situation, they'd look around, they'd observe, they'd make good decisions and good calls and then i'd watch them progress out of it and finish the problem and do well. and then i knew i had done my job.  tim ferriss: they had become aware.  jocko willink: they became aware as  leaders, yes.  tim ferriss: this is, in my mind at least, related to not panicking or at least being able to think in the midst of panic. there are so many examples of this in sports and elsewhere, but i remember doing some convoy and evasive driving training with a bunch of executive types - these are not military guys - just really for the experience. part of the training involved splitting up into two teams, having sort of an ambush team and trying to go get a broken down car with a person passed out inside - they might be dead, they might be passed out - back through basically a finish line.    we got to pick teams, and i happened to be one team leader. i picked the guy who had the best evasive driving skills to be the victor one driver, and i was in the passenger side with the commseverybody had paintball guns we had to keep the passenger side and driver's side windows down so we could get nailed. there were also drivers trying to take us off the road and whatnot. in any case, as soon as the paintballs started flying, this guy just gunned it in a straight line   no response to comms, no response to anything even though under the pressure of mock competition with the evasive driving and so on within cones, he'd been spectacular. how do you either pick people who are less  likely to have that just go into a kind of blind red zone where they're unresponsive, or prepare people and condition them so they can actually function when the shit starts hitting the fan?  jocko willink: that's  exactly right what you just said. we desensitized them to being in horrible situations and we conditioned them and kept putting that pressure on them until they can get through it.  tim ferriss: got it. so it's a  matter of exposure, mostly.  jocko willink: and most guys do. most guys, they go okay, i'm used to this. and then it will be up a level. for real, it will be up a level. and most guys will be good there, too; you'll have a couple fall out. but the seals teams does a very good job of applying that pressure of conditioning you and desensitizing you to horrible situations so that you can deal with it when it comes.    tim ferriss: we're just going to shift gears a little bit, and i know we're going to bounce around a lot but i've heard of your workouts when you're deployed. one guy said - i don't know if this is true - that you would roll with 20 guys in a platoon as a workout and just tap out like 20 guys. is that true?  jocko willink: yeah. you're rolling with guys who don't know anything. and so in order to get good training in, i would just have guys come in every 15 minutes. i remember this particularly when i was at team two. i would just have the guys come in every 15 or 20 minutes and just roll with them, and then another guy would come in. so yeah. but i was better than them at jiu-jitsu. it's not that i was any tougher; i just knew more.  tim ferriss: of course you know many good competitors in jiu-jitsu mma, when you  look at the top performers in that world and then some of the top performers you've met in the seal world, what are the commonalities, if any?  jocko willink: let me talk about jiu-jitsu first. one thing  i noticed about jiu-jitsu is when you get to the world class level of jiu-jitsu guys, there is a stratification there between guys who have  a natural, god given ability that is above and beyond normal human\u00e9 it's above and beyond what a normal human being would do or should be able to do. and there are not many of those people.  tim ferriss: who comes to mind when you think of that?  jocko willink: i think hixson gracie, who i've trained with. i was a blue  belt when i trained with him but you could feel that this guy is not normal. dean lister, who was my training partner forever and i've rolled with guys from all over the world and dean lister is at another level. i've never rolled with  marcello garcia but just from watching him in competition, you can see that he has that, as wellthere's not a large group of people at that level   and the next level down is guys who train like maniacs, and they're great athletes and they're awesome, too. those guys are the world champions, etc. so that's my estimation. and having rolled with guys on both ends of the spectrum, dean is an example because dean has won world championships training a miniscule amount compared to what a normal person  would have to train to get there. which i don't know if that's a compliment or a negative but it's true   now, in the seal teams, as far  as the high performers, i think it's the people who it's a certain level of focus, i think, and again a certain level of open-mindedness and a certain level of  dedication to the task and to the craft that they're dealing with. you get guys who are just super passionate about the job. and if you're super passionate about the job in the seal teams, there's a really good chance you're going to be one of the top performers. because you're going to put in all that extra effort to do well.  tim ferriss: what are you world class at that people might not realize?  jocko willink: first of all, i think world class is a strong word.  tim ferriss: it's a strong word.    jocko willink: because i'd say i'm world class at just about nothing. as far as what people might not know about me, one thing that's interesting about me is i live a fairly compartmentalized life, where my  jiu-jitsu friends would not meet my seal friends, who would not meet the people who i work with in a leadership situation or in a civilian sector business world. there are people who don't know that i'm a really good jiu-jitsu player or that i work with big  companies and help their leadership   so there's that. but if i had to say the skill set that i have that i think helped me was, number one, taking complex things and making them simple, and then being able to communicate that simplicity to other people is number one. and number two, the ability that we already talked about to detach myself from situations emotionally and mentally, usually not physically   you have to be able to do it without detaching physically. but those things would be what i would say are my talents, if i had any because i'm definitely not the fastest, not the strongest, not the most flexible or whatever, and not the smartest.  tim ferriss: but it seems like - very interesting - madonna would say the same thing, like i'm not the best dancer, i'm not the best singer,  i'm not the best this. but i think like yourself, she's kind of a five tool player, like a baseball player who can hit for power, hit for getting on base, can field, etc., etc. and it's the collection of those tools that makes you, say, a world class commander or something like that. what do your morning routines look like? on an ideal day, what does the first 90 minutes of your day look like? when do you wake up? what does that look like?  jocko willink: i wake up early. i wake up at 4:45. i like to have that psychological win over the enemyfor me, when i  wake up in the morning and i don't know why, i'm thinking about the enemy and what they're doingand i know i'm not active duty anymore but it's still in there, that there's a guy that's in a cave somewhere and he's rocking back and forth and he's got a machine gun in one hand and a grenade in the other hand, and he's waiting for me and we're going to meetiwhen i wake up in the morning, i'm thinking to myself what can i do to be ready for that moment which is coming, which  is comingso that propels me out of bed.   i work out early in the morning.  tim ferriss: so you wake up at 4:45. what's the next thing, aside from brushing your teeth and doing the usual?  jocko willink: i  do the usual, start working out. ideally, i like to get done with my workout by the time the sun comes up. so now if there's waves, i live by the ocean so i'll go surfing and get done with that.  tim ferriss: what does  the typical morning workout look like?  jocko willink: i do a lot of pull-ups, pushups and dips. i dead lift and do squats. i do sprints. it's everything that everybody does. i swing kettle bells, i do burpees. it's all that.  tim ferriss: it's like a 60 minute workout? how long is the workout?  jocko willink: it depends on what's going on. i'll try and do some strength movements to be strong; dead  lifts, cleans, clean and jerks, something like that to make myself stronger. or even if it something like just dead hang pull-ups and i'm just maxing out but i'll do something like that to make myself stronger. and sometimes that can take awhile because i'll just want to relax  and hit singles or doubles on dead lifts or cleans or whatever   then when i get done with that, i'll do some kind of metabolic conditioning of some kind. i'll be sprinting or rowing or swinging a kettle bell  or lighter weight clean and jerks for reps or something like that. that's what it looks like for me.  tim ferriss: so you finish training when the sun comes up, hit the waves, since they're there, which is a good policy. what happens then?  jocko willink: i'll come back and start doing normal human stuff.  tim ferriss: that's when the work begins, the professional\u00e9  jocko willink: i have a leadership and management consulting business so i'll have  clients to talk to, emails to push out. i'll start taking care of that business. i normally don't get hungry until 10 or 00 in the morning. so  around 10 or 00 i start wanting to start to graze on some food, and i'll do that. by noon, i'm feeling pretty hungry like i need some lunch.  tim ferriss: what does your diet generally look like?  jocko willink: it  generally looks like steak.  tim ferriss: steak.  jocko willink: and chicken and salad.  tim ferriss: paleo-ish.  jocko willink: yeah. i'm no stranger to having some mint chocolate chip ice cream or some ovaltine or whatever. again, i'm not a competitive body builder so i'll eat some normal food.  tim ferriss: right, you can indulge when the spirit  moves you. when you think of the word successful, who are the first people or the first person that comes to mind?  jocko willink: for me,  the part of the world that i've seen is a very dark placeit's a dark place. that's what war is. when  your job, which my job was, was to expand that darkness in many ways, war is about killing people. so for me, when i look to someone that's successful, it's someone that brings some light into that darkness so for me, the first people that come to my head are mark lee, who is one of my guys, first seal killed in iraq, mike monsor,  second seal killed in iraq, posthumously awarded the medal of honor, and ryan jobe, one of my guys wounded in iraq, blinded in both eyes   made it home, medically  retired from the navy, married his high school sweetheart, got her pregnant and finished his college degree. and after his 22nd surgery to repair the damage that was done to his head and face, there were complications and he died, as well. but all of those guys, in all that darkness,  they did things, they made a sacrifice that was completely selfless and to do that and to live and fight and die like a  warrior, that to me is successand those guys are my heroes.  tim ferriss: what do you struggle with? and i ask that because we've only just met but it's hard for me as a civilian to fathom what you and  your friends have been through; impossible for me to fathom. it makes me just feel ashamed for ever complaining about a bad day or a hard day, given what you guys have  experienced and the stakes that are involved, and the sacrifices and the sadness and tragedy that is a part of that job   what do you struggle with, whether it's in the business sphere  or just in life in general, if you're open to talking about it. i used to, when i had these icons in my head, i was like oh, my god, richard branson, he's got it al figured out, he's doing everything perfectly, he's on cruise control hitting home runs every time he gets at batand as i've slowly gotten to know obviously not branson directly, although i have met him before, i realize that people all have - and this is something you talked about  detachment   i've always had impatience and anger issues and it's helped me to be aggressive in sport and in business and in negotiation. but it's also caused some problems for me. but i've realized  that one of the ways i can tone that down is by realizing everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about in some way. what are the things that you find difficult or that you struggle with, or have struggled with?  jocko willink: it's  an interesting question, and this is a filler answer, in case you couldn't tell that. because when i start off with \"it's an interesting question,\" that means i'm not really quite sure what to say. i've been lucky. i've been blessed. i've  had a life that i would not trade with anyone in the world. when you talk about ramadi, that was the highlight of my life because i was leading men in combat, which was  something that i always wanted to do and something that i felt that i was destined to do   and when i was in that situation, i knew that. i don't look back and say i wish i would have enjoyed that. no, i knew it then. this is it this is what you have been waiting for your whole life and what you really have been preparing for your whole life. i was lucky to be there and i was lucky to have incredible guys to work with, both in my unit and in the other units in the army and the marine corps that we worked with. i was lucky enough to have guys who were so brave and so dedicated. i will use  the word fearless, not that they didn't have fear but that they overcame it all the time   so i'd say if there's anything that i struggle with now, it's just that does  anything else matter? and the answer is no. the answer is no, nothing else matters. nothing else is close so i have to deal with that. struggle is a strong word because i don't sit there at night, wishing i was back - well, okay, i do do that sometimes. i often wish i was back. but i don't dwell on it because it's gone i'm so happy that i could be a part of it and that i was able to work with such tremendous guys. i try and keep their memory alive  every day in my own head.  tim ferriss: how did you, when you were active, reconcile the risks that are inherent in that job with family, with  your family?  jocko willink: first of all, when i was young, i thought that i was going to die. i thought i was going to die in combat. there was no war going on; this was ignorant thoughts. this was young, stupid, unknowledgeable idiot saying i'm never even going to make it to 30. and i was good with that because i had nothing. i was a single guy who wanted to go out and destroy the world; that's awesome   then as i got older and i realized i'm actually going to live to be 30 and probably 40, i had to work through thati  got married along the way, had kids, and when i had kids, i actually felt more ready to die because i had left children.  and so i actually felt like i was okay with that. which i guess that's bad, but men have  been traveling and fighting for thousands and thousands of years, since the beginning of mankind. and i knew that as a warrior, that's okay   and sometimes men don't come home, and the families drive on and that's the way the world works. so i didn't really have much to reconcile there. now, as far as division of time and having a family, i can tell you i  was very lopsided and unbalanced in that situation. the seal teams to me was everything, and nothing else mattered. well, i shouldn't say it didn't matter but it was definitely on a much lower priority. i  remember actually my wife sent me an email when i was on deployment   she's very independent, doing her thing and she sends me an email that says something along the lines of hey, send us a picture  of where you sleep. fair enough; show the kids where i sleep at nightand so i went up to my room. we had some old saddam palace that we had taken over, not really a palace; a saddam house that we had taken over and that's where we lived, and i had one of the rooms in this building. so i went up and i took some digital pictures of my bed. i looked at them and i said wait a second   i went into a folder that i had, and i pulled it out and i took out pictures of my wife and kids and i hung them up on  the wall. and i took pictures and i sent those home, and i took the pictures back down. because i didn't want to be thinking about my  wife and kids when i had men's lives at stake. that's how i compartmentalized and did what i had to do, which was be dedicated to my guys, to the mission,  and to the country   at that point in time, it had to take priority over everything. it took priority over everything. my guys, they had families they had to go home to. i can't be thinking about this other stuff. so there's a little reconciliation.    tim ferriss: now that you've entered the civilian world, are there particular non military leaders, whether they're ceos or maybe outside of the private sector you admire or look to in some way as role models?  jocko willink: you meet these guys and girls, and a lot of them might as well have been in the seal teams. they're aggressive, they're making things happen and yeah, i admire and learn from them all the timeand i think they get the same thing from me, and t hat's why i'm in business. so absolutely america is the greatest country on earth and capitalism is one of the things that makes this country so great   and those folks who run these businesses are part of that fabric that makes america great. so absolutely, they're incredible people and they have the same faults that seals have, and they make the same mistakes. they get involved with emotionally with stuff and their ego gets in the way, of course; just like  it happens with seals it happens with them. they make the same mistakes where they don't explain the mission to their troops   or they don't break it down from a strategic level to a tactical level so the people on the front line can understand. so it's all the same mistakes and again, that's kind of why we're in business now.  tim ferriss: right, humans will be humans. group dynamics will be group dynamics.  jocko willink: exactly. unfortunately, that is correct.  tim ferriss: when you were talking about the detachment, it made me think of  quite a few years ago when i had my first sort of frivolous lawsuit come in, which completely paralyzed me. i was so intimidated and shocked and fearful. it ended up getting completely tossed out but it took a long time and a lot of money. i ended up developing migraines, i started clenching my jaw to the point where i had these shooting pains and i had to get a mouthpiece. it caused a whole cascade of health problems  and issues   i remember talking to a number of my buddies who had been in business for decades at very high levels. one of them, i won't give his full name away but pete, really hilarious but brilliantly effective executive, he goes: timmy,  you're too fucking nice. i should have sued you just because you should get used to it. and he started stalking me, treating it like such a non event. it was just such a non event for him. i couldn't compute it at the time but now i've just realized some of these  things are a cost of doing business   and if you're going to be aggressive and push the envelope, and step into environments that are uncertain because that's where a lot of rewards are potentially, you're going to deal with these thingsso now i'm at a point where i've been exposed to that enough times, not necessarily frivolous lawsuits but just legal headaches because that's sort of a side effect of having a very vigorous free market is on the one hand you have some legal complications   what  i've tried to figure out for myself, spending time with people who have been deployed and done the realistic training that you've referred to, some of which is just beyond intense  as they've described it to me, i've wanted to take myself out of this sort of keyboard shackled experience from day to day and expose myself to more of these stresses to try to toughen myself and inoculate myself against future uncertainty and things like that. what are skills or experiences that you think every man should have?     jocko willink: there's a whole list of those.  tim ferriss: i'm interested because quite frankly, i feel like - and i've had female friends say this to me, where they're like you know, i meet a lot of guys, i date  a lot of guys but there just aren't many men out there anymore. which we could deep really far into that, and there's all sorts of complicated gender questions and topics that could raise. but just putting all of that aside for the time being, i think a lot of folks like myself,  even, and i experienced this when i was doing the four hour chef and really got back into doing hunting and field dressing and trying to build things and working with fire   i was like wow, i feel like i'm slowly becoming maybe barely manually literate,  compared to my great grandfather who was chopping wood every day, building stuff, fixing things that broke, etc. what would be on that list in your mind? if guys are listening to this saying you know what, i want to toughen the fuck up just a little bit.  jocko willink: if you were bare bones basic, you're talking food, shelter and water, right? do you have the skills to bring those things to the table and make them happen? i think that's a very basic place to start. i can tell you that from my perspective,  and i actually gave a speech at one of my buddies' weddings. i said that there were three things in my life that made me feel like a man when i say feel like a man, it doesn't mean bow up and feel like a man; it actually means the opposite. it actually means i'm confident enough that i don't need to bow up and i don't need to\u00e9  tim ferriss: bow up meaning puff up your chest?  jocko willink: puff up my chest and  i'm a bad ass. the first one was actually jiu-jitsu. it was learning how to fight and knowing that there's not a question that if i get into an altercation, i can handle myself; 100 percent. because when you don't know jiu-jitsu, or you don't know how to fight, then you question that in the back of your mind. and how do you answer that question? you act like an asshole. these are the guys who run around in a bar getting in fights with people because they don't know. they're not confident that they can handle themselves.   so that was number one. number two is going into combatbecause again, there was a big question mark of you don't know for sure how  you're going to react in those situations. i felt pretty good that i knew how i was going to act, but you need to check the box. and so i checked that box and i knew that i  was going to do fine, and then i did fine and i was brave and not scared and was to detach myself, and make decisions, and make things happen. so that was good.   and then the last one was getting married and having kidsbecause now all of a sudden i have other humans that are directly relying on me as their sole kind of leader and realizing that this is the most important thing. you have to make this the most important thing in your life. and you're out of that game, too. so you're no longer trying to impress a girl or whatever because you've got a girl. and so there's a level  of i don't care anymorethose three things for me were kind of where i was able to say i'm good; now let's focus on being a good guy and moving forward.tim ferriss: those were three good ones. on the jiu-jitsu side, that's the only one i can speak to, having done a little bit here and there and also moytoy and whatnot. i think it's so valuable on so many levels because not only do you know you can handle yourself but if you think you're a tough guy and you go to a good gym, you get taught really quickly how un-tough you are. i just remember, for instance, i was training at fairtex ages ago  here in san francisco, and one of the guys who is a trainer, his name is enn, e-n-n. he was as southpaw so i trained with him because i'm a southpaw   the most unassuming little dude you've ever seen in your life, calves the size of my torso but otherwise, you would never guess in a million years. and he had terrible fashion sense he'd wear these huge baseball caps that would cover his entire head so he looked like he was about 7 years old. he was only five foot one, five foot two. huge, baggy tee shirt and baggy pants so he just looked like average guy who's going to be some  type of manual laborer and people would mistake him for being mexican.   i just remember he went out to this bar because the gym was on clementina street, which was between howard and folsom, between 5th and 6th, which was a terrible place to be when i was training there. in fact, alex gong the owner, was shot in the chest and killed basically while i was there.  jocko willink: i remember that.  tim ferriss: by  a guy stuck in traffic; it's an insane story. but suffice it to say, he goes out to a bar and i was at a fly-in camp at the time with a bunch of other guys. this guy pulls a knife on one of the other trainers, why, who knows everybody kind of backs up and there are two groups facing each other. one of the guys is like, i'm gonna fuck you up, to enn who is a tiny little guy   and he just throws the nastiest, round ass kick you can imagine,  basically breaks the guy in half like just a lego figure being broken by a gorilla. that was just the showstopper. i think once you train with people like that, you're like i am never going to pick a fight. because you never know who the enn is.  jocko willink: that's absolutely true.  tim ferriss: i think it's also that confidence and that humility transfers to so many other areas because you realize like wow, i thought i was the cat's meow, i thought i was the king of the hill in areas a, b, c, d, or e but you know what? that's probably not the case. on the combat side of things, what are stressful experiences that  a civilian might expose themselves to that could i know to perfectly simulate it but to perhaps give them that type of fear inoculation or conditioning on some level?  jocko willink: i think any of those  rock climbing, parachuting, anything that has a real danger to it, which both of those things can and do. i think those can definitely help. i would say those are a couple good examples. i'm sure we could sit here and brainstorm about it. we could say paintball. but there's no real risk in paintball; there's just zero. so it's cool and you can definitely get  somewhat conditioned to that panic and that stress level because it hurts when you get hit by a paintball: ow, ow, ow. but it's not the fear of death. the fear of death is, i guess, the real  thing that we're talking about.  tim ferriss: that's the benchmark.  jocko willink: you overcome that fear of death and then what else is there to be afraid of now?  tim ferriss: you and i are sitting here, we're in my house and you noticed the musashi  that i have out over there, this historical novel about miyamoto musashi. i don't know where it came from and i can't really pinpoint it but the reason i have that there is to remind me that if you're constantly afraid of death, you're paralyzed in so many facets of your life, it really prohibits you from making even effective decisions.   so one could say you should love your family and have the photos up and it's like well, if i really want to love my family and go home to  see my family, maybe i shouldn't have those up as something that's going to occupy a part of my brain; i need to be effective in the field for me and my men.  jocko willink: no doubt about it.  tim ferriss: so it's thinking not about that first move that looks good on paper and to everyone around you, but  thinking about the second, the tertiary effect, etc. are there any books that you've gifted to other people or what do you gift to someone?    jocko willink: so for books, i think there's only one book that i've ever given and i've only given it to a couple people. that's a book called about face, by colonel david hackworth. it is huge. have you ever heard of it?  tim ferriss: i haven't, and i was just looking for\u00e9 oh, wait. here's my pad.  jocko willink: interestingly, i looked for it today to see if i could download a digital copy and i don't think it's available digitally, which surprised me. so colonel david hackworth, the tail end of world war ii he was in korea. he was highly decorated in korea. he joined the merchant  marines or something when he was 15 and got into the army, again, right after world war ii. so he kind of got raised by those world war ii veterans. and then he was in korea, and he was in vietnam, and he was just absolutely  borderline worshipped by the men that he led and by some of the senior leadership. just a great book.   he was a rebel, you know? and he did question the way we were doing things. and what's controversial about him is that he's the guy who said to walter cronkite, or he's the first guy in vietnam who said we're not going to win this thing so he's kind of blacklisted by much of the army. but as you dig into that, what he was really saying was we're not going to win this thing if we keep fighting how we're fighting   he recognized that we needed to do a significant paradigm shift in the strategy  that we were executing over there. it's like you've heard we've never lost a tactical battle in vietnam. you've heard that, right?  tim ferriss: yes.  jocko willink: and there are plenty of people who will say that all day long. but if you and i are leading a platoon,  and we take our platoon out and we hit a booby trap and it kills three of our guys, or two of our guys and wounds another three, and there's no one to shoot at. we medevac those guys and we come back to base. who won that? he recognized that.  tim ferriss: so the metrics that were being used were not a smoke screen but they were at best the wrong metrics, in a lot of cases.  jocko willink: i had that book next to my bed in ramadi. i literally read it every  night. that's how i'd fall asleep. i'd go up, read a couple pages, just open to any page and you'd find something. it was very comparable. they were working with the south vietnamese army and guess what? they were corrupt, and they were scared, and they weren't the best soldiers and we were working with iraqis  and guess what?i they were corrupt, and they were scared, and they weren't the best\u00e9 there were so many parallels between the two. so that's the book that i've given to a couple close friends of mine that i wanted them to have.  tim ferriss: about face.  jocko willink: the other book that i've read  multiple times is blood meridian.  tim ferriss: i don't know that one.  jocko willink: it's written by cormac mccarthy.  tim ferriss: oh, fantastic writer.  jocko willink: this is his best book. and i was an english major in college so i was forced to read all kinds of books. obviously, shakespeare is kind of the pinnacle in my mind. cormac   mccarthy is the guy that i think actually has that. and if you read blood meridian, there it is. what i find so gripping about it is  i talked earlier about the darkness of the world. this is an historical novel based on the group called the glanton gang that were killing indians and they ended up killing everybody. if you had black hair, your scalp was going to be taken   that's what it's about, and it's completely epic. but for me, it communicated to me a guy, cormac mccarthy, was able to show the darkness in humanity and there's nothing pleasant in any way, shape or form in that book but that's, in many ways, the world that i lived in.  tim ferriss: i struggle with this myself -and when i say struggle with, what am i struggling with - how much to voluntarily expose myself to darkness. because i have sort of ups and downs that i contend with and a lot of people in my family just hereditarily deal with this. but i feel like on one hand i don't want to be pollyanna-ish. i don't want  to just put on my rose colored glasses and believe everything is okay, everyone has everyone else's best interests in mind   because i've had friends who've been kidnapped, i've had nothing that compares to what you've experienced but i've seen enough glimpses of this brutish nastiness that on one hand i wonder as a civilian, should i not look at that stuff? should i try to shield myself? you know, develop a basic level of protection and skills but otherwise shield myself from it because it's not my job to have to look that in the face and in fact, it will darken my view of humanity   or should i really stare it directly in the eyes and recognize it for what it is and become acquainted with it? and i don't know why i think about this as much as i do. maybe because i have enough friends who have been in the military that it's sometimes a topic of conversation. but  what are your thoughts?  jocko willink: i think that in order to truly experience the light and the bright, you have to see the darkness. and i think if you shield yourself from the darkness, you'll not appreciate and fully understand the beauty of life. again, i go back to the sacrifices that i saw guys make on the battlefield, and it's in the complete  darkness of the world, of the human soul. you see that there's nothing brighter than somebody who lays down their life for their friends. and so i think if you want to  understand the beauty and the glory of the life you have, it is good to know and understand that darkness.  tim ferriss: that makes sense. what are some of the most common misconceptions about navy seals? or, you can pick whichever one you want to tackle; what inaccuracies bother you about seals or the military, for that matter, that are common in movies?  jocko willink: one of the things that i talk about when i talk to businesses, because businesses think that  if you're a military guy, if tim is a military guy and i outrank you, and i tell you to go do something, you're going to go do it with a big smile on your face and you're going to make it happen. that's the misconception. if  that was true, military leadership would be the easiest form of leadership in the world because everyone would just obey your commands   and it couldn't be further from the truth. now, it would work if i outrank you and i tell you to go clean the toilet, you go, okay, you outrank  me, and you go do it. but then you multiply the intensity there times infinite to where i'm telling you you need to go charge your machine gun nest and you're going to die if you do it; are you going to listen to me?  tim ferriss: i wouldn't want to.  jocko willink: you wouldn't want to and you may or may not. you may or may not. i need to be a leader. i need to actually be a leader. if i'm going to actually get you to do stuff, i need to lead you. i can't just order you to do it. so that's the biggest misconception is that if we're in the military and i order you to do something, you're going to have to do it. now again, you're not going to disobey the chain of command. but there are many stories from seals in vietnam who have told me they got tasked with the mission to go out and do x    and they looked at the mission and said you know what, that doesn't make any sense. i'll tell you what they'd go out and patrol 100 yards outside the wire, sit down in a little rice patty somewhere, wait two hours, come back and say yeah, the target wasn't there  or the ambush didn't happen or whatever. they would just blatantly disobey - not blatantly\u00e9  tim ferriss: surreptitiously.  jocko willink: yes, surreptitiously disobey orders. that's one of the big challenges. another thing i'll get is i'll meet with a ceo, and he'll say i can't wait for you to get in here and whip my people into shape. in their mind, they're thinking if i come in and yell and scream and make people do\u00e9  tim ferriss: drill instructor, right.  jocko willink: \u00e9 pushups like a drill instructor, that that will somehow create  a paradigm shift with the strategy and the culture of the companywe both can laugh at that because it's completely false. it comes very quickly as i start to talk to them about what's happening inside their company; they realize that  what have we done from a leadership perspective is infinitely more about brains than it is about brawn. and the brawn stuff is from the movies and it does not work in reality.  tim ferriss: when you  mentioned the seals in vietnam sitting right outside the tripwires or whatnot, it made me think of band of brothers. i don't know what your opinion is of that entire series but\u00e9  jocko willink: awesome.  tim ferriss: i've watched it multiple times. my mom is very fascinated by world war ii. so letters from iwo jima and so on. so that fascination was passed on to mehardcore history is an amazing podcast for listening to, whether it's world war i or ghengis khan or otherwise\u00e9  jocko willink: i completely second that.tim ferriss: oh, it's so good.  jocko willink: i  tell people about it all the time.  tim ferriss: yeah, dan carlin's amazing. but in band of brothers, they were tasked with a raid towards the end and it's like we've already won this, and this is for some type of  - this is for someone who wants a promotion 1,000 miles away so they made the decision to kind of sit it out. i don't know why i felt compared to share that. i think that band of brothers, for me more than anything else that i've observed, i felt like i had a window into the pain and suffering and courage and sacrifice that was involved in a battle that is, i suppose in many ways, very, very different from the insurgent sort of counter insurgency warfare in terms of terrain   when you have a bad guy like hitler, it seems like in retrospect, everyone's on your side. if somebody as a civilian wants to get a better  understanding of the experiences that you've had, aside from the books you recommended, are there movies or documentaries that do it justice?  jocko willink: restrepo, which i'm sure you've seen.  tim ferriss: i have seen. that's heart wrenching.  jocko willink: it's unbelievable. there is an hour long, i think it's history channel, it's actually called a chance in hell; the battle for ramadi, which is about the battle for ramadi i like band of brothers. i love the pacific. did you see the pacific?  tim ferriss: i've had it recommended to me multiple times.  jocko willink: it's the band of brothers in the pacific. so it's absolutely phenomenal. i had read several l of the books that the pacific is based on. eugene sledge, i had read his book, with the old breed. i had read a bunch of those books so i kind of knew and understood. and that's just a phenomenal  epic story. and got to me. like when i was watching it, i got that feeling. i remember there's  one scene where they're walking through the jungle in some island on the pacific, and nothing has happened yet. and i  had that feeling, it's just like the feeling you'd have in ramadiyou'd be walking down the street. if no shots had been fired  yet, it's this feeling of anticipation but it's fear, it's anticipation, it's the unknown and it's the waiting.  tim ferriss: it sounds eerie.  jocko willink: it's the waiting for it to happen, and you know it' s coming. and i got that feeling watching the pacific, and that was in one of the early ones. i said wow, this is nailing it.  tim ferriss: well done. i have to watch that. this is definitely the final push i need to  watch that. what would you put on a billboard? if you could have one billboard anywhere, what would you put on it?  jocko willink: one  of my kind of\u00e9 i guess my mantra is a very simple one, and that's discipline equals freedom. i've found that as an  individual, the more disciplined you are, and it's counterintuitive; the more disciplined you are, the more freedom you actually have. you and i both know if you wake up early, you get more done and you end up with more free time. so the more you manage your time, the more disciplined you are with your time management, the more free time you end up having. the more disciplined you are physically with your diet, the more freedom you have because you can do  more stuff   you have more freedom. so the more disciplined you are, the more freedom you have. and what's interesting is how that transfers over to both military units and the civilian sector. when an element or  when a unit or when a company is a disciplined group, they actually end up with more freedom. i had a seal troop. we were highly disciplined. we had standard operation procedures for just about everything that we did. and you'd  think that that would restrain your creativity, but it actually doesn'tthe more disciplined you are, the easier i could say: hey, you four go take down that building   and they knew want to do because they were highly disciplined, i knew what they were going to because they were highly disciplined. we understood what parameters they were going to stay within because we had standard operating procedures to follow. so that discipline, both on an individual level and as a group equals freedom. and just like anything else  with leadership, you can take that too far   you can discipline an element or a person so much that they break down and they no longer have creativity. so just like the dichotomy of leadership, you can go too strong with discipline and they end  up breaking down, or you can give them too much freedom and they break down in the other direction.tim ferriss: i'm really glad you mentioned that. i've realized in a way that when i struggle the most, kind of existentially  or really just creatively, it's when i have the fewest constraints. i want positive constraintsi need boxes, not so that i have to stay within the box but that i can start a least coloring inside the box. that's part of the reason i've been so excited to adopt this rescue puppy, molly, because it forces me to regiment and structure my day in such a way that i can then plan around fixed  objects   i think that whether it's in the military, at least in my experience in business, you want to reserve your creativity for the things that require creativity, not for what should the steps be when i'm doing a room clearance. it's like no, you want  a standard operating procedure so that your brain cycles are allocated to the places where you need those brain cycles.  jocko willink: that's 100 percent right.  tim ferriss: so i've realized in the last few months for myself that what i thought i wanted, which is  freedom in the form of infinite options, is not actually what i want at all. it's very stressful. and you end up burning calories. you burn 10 calories in a million directions, you're fatigued and you didn't get shit done. so i'm actually, in a way, trying to figure out how i can say now to a thousand things so that i can be fully creative on one or two things   part of the reason i enjoy doing this podcast so much is that when you talk to people who have operated at the highest  levels in any field, this kind of stuff comes up. and after awhile it's like ferriss, idiot, do you get the message yet? you've heard meditation from 80 percent of the people who have been on your podcast. maybe you should chill the fuck out and sit down for 20 minutes every morning.   i want to talk about ownership. could you explain your book and why you decided to write it?  jocko willink: first of all, while i was still in the seal teams, once everyone knew i was getting out, i had guys saying you need to write this stuff down, you need to pass on these lessons learned. i did that in almost a doctrinal way when i captured those lessons learned and passed those on. and then when i started working with civilian companies, leif, my business partner, and i started hearing the same thing. which is: hey, do you guys have a reference? we want to  hand out some stuff to the rest of our people who couldn't make this!  and hey, you guys really changed the way this group is operating; we want to spread that to the rest of our groups. do you have a book we can give them? do you have reference material? eventually we  said okay, we need to write something. from my perspective, this is an opportunity for us to pass on the lessons that we learned and relearned some of the lessons we learned and talk about have been around for thousands of years, and some of them were discovered a little bit more recently   but they are definitely solid and they've been very well tested in a variety of environments, starting with the harshest environment of them all which is sustained, violent, urban combat. and then we've brought them to dozens and dozens of companies and we  keep hearing the same thing, which is these work.  tim ferriss: what's the explanation behind the title?  jocko willink: it actually came from an email that i sent to a manager in a company. when i was in the seal teams and i was a troop commander, so i was in charge of tasking to bruiser and we were getting ready to go on deployment. and occasionally the commodore, which is actually one rank above my boss is a guy named the commodore, which is a full bird colonel, if you're in the marine corps or the army. and he's kind of in charge of all the seal teams on the west coast. and so he would have occasional meetings where he'd bring in us, the troop commanders, the front line guys.  tim ferriss: and this is west coast of the u.s.?  jocko willink: west coast of the u.s. the story that i told in this email was that he would go around  the room, because he wants to get some direct feedback from the troops. he'd ask somebody, what do you need? and these guys are my peers. someone would say well, the boots that we have are okay in the hot weather but we're getting ready to be in a cooler environment and we need new boots and we need them by this date because that's our next training block. okay, got it.   and he'd get to the next person who'd say when we're out at the desert training facility, there's no wifi internet so our guys are disconnected and we really need to get wifi out there okay, got it. the next guy would say we need more helicopter training support because we don't feel like we're working around helicopters enough and w really need that. and eventually, he'd get to me. the commodore would say: jocko, what do you need?    and i would say, we're good, sir. i was stating the obvious, which is if i have problems, i'm going to handle them. i'm going to take care of them and i'm not going to complain. i took extreme ownership of my world the way that worked twofold was when i did need something, number one it was something significant, it was something real. and when i told the commodore, hey boss, we need this right here, i would almost get it instantaneously  because he knew that i really, truly needed it   i had written and told this story and talked about extreme ownership and owning everything in your world because the other piece of that is people complain,  they place blame on other peopleand finally, if tim's boss isn't giving you the support you need, whose fault is that? whose fault is it? if your boss is not giving you what you need, whose fault is that?  tim ferriss: i suppose it's my fault.  jocko willink: plenty of people will say it's my boss's fault. no, it's actually your fault because you haven't educated them, you haven't influenced them, you haven't explained to them in a manner they understand why you need this support that you need. and so that's extreme ownership; that's where the title came from.  tim ferriss: or you've made them, as you alluded to, you've made them immune to your requests because you're the boy who cries wolf.  jocko willink: exactly.  tim ferriss: if you're constantly needy, they will determine that nothing is important, or it's not a real urgent important request.  jocko willink: that's extreme ownership in a nutshell: you're taking responsibility for everything in your world and there's no one else  to blame. and when we do talk about bosses, i tell this to people al the time because i always hear complaining about people's bossesand i tell people that i worked for every different type of boss you could imagine. superb, tactical geniuses who were incredible leaders of men, and i've worked for people who didn't know anything and were horrible   and i have the same relationship with all of them. which is i built up trust with  them so that they trusted that i was going to do the right thing, and they gave me the support i needed. i took ownership of those relationships to make sure that was always the case. that's another piece. if you have a problem with your boss, it's not your boss's  fault, it's your fault. and obviously, it's the same thing down the chain of command, as well.  tim ferriss: what are some of the principles or lessons that the companies you've worked with have found most valuable?    jocko willink: cover and move is a big one.  tim ferriss: cover and move?  jocko willink: cover and move. so if you and i were going to attack a building across the street where there was an enemy, i would get in a window here and i would start shooting at them.  tim ferriss: covering fire.  jocko willink: covering fire. and you would move. when you heard me shooting, you would start to move and you'd find a better tactical position. and then once you got in a better tactical position, you would start shooting and i would move. and eventually we would get to a position where we could kill the enemy and take down  the building. so that's called cover and move. and honestly, when i started talking to companies, i aid to myself, how do i translate an actual gun fighting tactic? that's all it is. it's a gun fighting contact   how do you translate that to a company, to a business?  as soon as i started talking to businesses, the first business i talked to, i realized that guess what? every single business has multiple different elements within it. you've got an operational group, you've got a manufacturing group, you've got a sales group. and guess what? all those elements have absolutely got to work together, cover and move for each other. because if i'm the sales guy and i sell something, and you're the manufacturer, and you don't manufacture it in time or it's faulty or whatever, we fail   and if you manufacture a bunch of perfect units and i can't sell any of them, guess what? we fail. so that's a huge one that people really grab onto because just about every  company experiences some need to cover and move.tim ferriss: there are so many maxims that are memorable from the military, one that i only got exposed to a few days ago and you mentioned it when we got started right here was the fact that i have two recorders. so what is the expression? i was trained very early on to think about single points of failure. actually, my first job, which was mass data storage, so you  always want redundancy. they're all about redundancy. whether that's a ray to ray or anything else, you don't want a single point of failure. what was the expression that you used again?  jocko willink: two is one and one is none. it just means have a backup.  tim ferriss: have a backup. if you only have one of something, it's going to disappear. the structure of the book, i really like and i spoke with pete about this. could you describe it? because it seems like every chapter has a story from combat that reflects  a principle. then you explain the principle and then you use a business story to show how that translates?  jocko willink: that's exactly right.  tim ferriss: what do you think is a part of the book that people might not pay enough  attention to that they should pay more attention to? for instance, in the four hour chef - i'll give an example - when i'm talking about an accelerated learning frame, like [inaudible] instruction,  got it. selection, doing the 80/20 analysis, got itsequencing: cool, got it. stakes: setting up c consequences, they kind of gloss over it. and i'm like no, no. if you don't have sufficient incentives, like a punishment or reward, all that other stuff, the how-to stuff, doesn't matter. but they gloss over it   and i take responsibility for that, like maybe i didn't highlight the importance enough. but what are areas or chapters of the book, anything that comes to mind where you're like, you know what? people might gloss over this or pay less attention to it than they should.  jocko willink: i don't know if this will answer your question but what's been interesting on the feedback we've gotten is we have different people find different chapters; they latch onto different chaptersand so there are even chapters where we said hey, maybe we should take this chapter out; i don't know about this chapter or that chapter. and we even got some feedback saying take this chapter out, and literally would get someone saying the best chapter is the chapter that someone else told us to take outiso i think that  people are going to identify very easily what relates to them. there will be a high point of this completely relates to me, and then there will be some others: oh yeah, i've seen that before, not as much because maybe that's a skill area that they have so they don't really need to work on that. that's what i've found most interesting is that variety of answers when people like the different sections and they get something out of the various chapters.  tim ferriss: that's  a really good sign, by the way. and i know we're chatting about this book and i'm excited to see what it does in the wildwhat i've noticed for the books that i've written, which are way, way too long for any sane person to write them; reading is a different story. because it can be like a choose your own adventure book   but what i've done proofreading and when i've had friends read, the rule that i've decided on is to remove something, you need a consensus. to keep something, you only need one person  to love it. so if i have one person who says i love this part, it doesn't matter if nine out of ten people say i hate it; it stays in.  jocko willink: that's a good rule.  tim ferriss: so you don't need everything in a book to apply to every personit's just like if you had a commanding officer, not everything that person would say would equally apply to you if they're dealing with groups as you have dealt with groups and teams. so that's a very promising sign there are so many questions i could ask you, i don't even know where to start. let me take a quick glance at a few things here because i know we want to grab some  food in not too short order.  jocko willink: jocko hungry.  tim ferriss: jocko hungry, jocko smash. i don't want jocko to smash me because i would be helpless. what do you talk to about seals more versus civilians? obviously, you have the comradery and common background of the warfare experience. but aside from trading those stories, what do you tend to talk to seals about more versus civilians?  jocko willink: straight to the point when i go and talk to seals, i spend a little more time talking about - number one, i talk about the tactics, the actual on the ground tactics of what was happening, and that's valuable lessons learned another thing that i talk about in depth is around the piece of risk mitigation. now, as you know in the business world, risk mitigation is huge and as a matter of fact, the first time  i ever spent the day with a ceo and he said what do you think about this stuff, i said it's kind of like what i used to do: risk mitigation.    but when you're talking about your guys getting killed, it's a whole nother ballgame. and i remember a conversation i had with my commanding officer. so this is the type of thing i would tell seals. we are not on deployment yet so we're still back in america and my commanding officer brings me in. he knew  we were going to ramadi. he knew ramadi was really bad. and he said before you go on any operation, i want you to think about if it is worth the risk of losing one  of your guys   and i said to him, sir, i don't need to think about that. i can tell you right now there's no operation you can task me with that i would trade one of my guys for; not going to happen. that being said, we are going on deployment to iraq. we have a mission and we have a job, and we have a duty to execute that mission. and we will take risks, and we'll do everything we can to mitigate those risks. but if we're going to take zero risks, then we might as well just stay here in san diego, california    that's the kind of thing\u00e9 people can be very risk averse, even in the military. it can get very, very risk averse. and it's understandable it's understandable that you say is this worth the risk or not? and my point always was you have to just mitigate the risks as much as you can, but there are going to be risks you're going to have to deal with.  tim ferriss: absolutely. and in a  military context, it seems like a huge risk is not making a decision, which is a decision in and of itself. and when i look at, say, the laird hamiltons of the world, who is an incredible big wave surfer, or i just interviewed jimmy chin, who is one of the key climbers; he's effectively a professional athlete in this documentary called marhu, which is about this shark's fin in i want to say india but it might be pakistan, this rock face that has defeated  the world's best climbers for 30 years   people view all of these people as massive risk takers, and when you actually sit down and talk to these guys, you realize they are expert risk mitigators.  i think it's very easy to come to the mistaken conclusion in business, for example, that you only win big if you bet the farm. and in fact, when i talk to some of these companies here in silicon valley, for instance, that have  become worth billions and billions of dollars, some rightly, some maybe in the rational exuberance of our current day, but many i think rightly so   you see that in my experience, in no cases have they bet the farmthey have evaluated the downside, they've tried to measure the maximum allowable downside, they know not only their bet and their bet size but when they're going to fold they have an exit strategy for minimizing or capping losses. and unfortunately, i think that the kind of renegade risk taker gets romanticized in a lot of different spheres including  business, and they get the magazine covers in some cases because it makes for a good story   but there is a huge survivorship bias because you don't get to see the nine out of ten who tried the same excessively ballsy move and got their balls chopped off. they  don't make it to the magazine cover.  jocko willink: i'll get up and brief a bunch of missions that we did and when i get done, i'll be saying i didn't brief you guys on any missions that we didn't do. there were plenty of missions that we looked at, we weighed the risk versus the reward and we said not worth the riskand so we do the exact, same thing. i think you're 100 percent right. very high-level risk mitigation is the same in business and in combat.  tim ferriss: yeah i remember hearing an expression, i don't know who to attribute this to but it's like if you cap your downside, the upside takes care of itself. and i'm not sure that that applies in every circumstance and it might not be a perfect guideline but it's a helpful guideline. where it's like if you take enough shots and  you've constantly capped your downside, if you have a couple of outliers that give you disproportionate upside, in the long run you're going to average out ahead and beat most people, especially the people who are cavalier who's a historical figure that you identify with, if any?  jocko willink: i talked about david hackworth, and i look up to him. by the way, he became a peace guy. that's where he ended up, living in australia  as a premier, leading the pack on anti nuclear weaponsso he's not your average guy. a historical figure?  tim ferriss: that's a tough question. i'm not sure what my answer would be.  jocko willink: i'll stick with hackworth.tim ferriss: alright, hackworth it is. what is something most people would be surprised to know about you?  jocko willink: again,  i think it's the same thing i talked about earlier with the fact that i have a certain look to me, you might say, that i look like kind of a serial killer combined with some kind of a psychopathic steroid mutant.  tim ferriss: you saw my text to my girlfriend. i was just trying to prepare her.  jocko willink: i think  there's some kind of surprise when people hear me string a sentence together and say okay. so i think that's surprising to a lot of people.  tim ferriss: it makes me think of this comedian, jim gaffigan, really  funny guy. he's talking about how attractive people have it really easybecause he's like: and then there's a beautiful woman and she has a book, and people are like ooh, she's beautiful and she can readdouble threat. but no, you're very good at stringing sentences together do you have any bad habit or bad habits that you're working to overcome?  jocko willink: bad habits?  tim ferriss: i can rephrase: non-ideal habits. what are you trying to improve about yourself?  jocko willink: i'm trying to improve everything all the timethat's a much easier question because i want to be faster, stronger, more limber, smarter, quicker, wittier, always everything always trying to improve.  tim ferriss: so if you were to prioritize those currently, let's just say over the next 12 months, which are the areas that you're hoping to most push into overdrive or improve upon?  jocko willink: i  literally wake up every day and i'm trying to do all those things. i don't know how i would prioritize them. and the reason i think is because they're not mutually exclusive. one of my  laws of combat is prioritize and execute. which means if you've got multiple problems going on, if you try to handle them all at once, you will absolutely fail. so prioritize and execute                                      you look at what problems you have, you pick the most impactful one or the biggest threat and you solve that one. and then you move on to the next one and the next one and so forth. i can definitely read and work out and stretch all in the same days. these are not mutually exclusive things and  i'll do them all.  tim ferriss: you're right, and i guess it could be viewed as a trick question. i was reading a number of transcribed lectures by christian emeriti and he talked about - and i'm probably butchering this by paraphrasing it but the fact that people talk about changing one small thing at a time. and i do think there's a place for that in behavioral change and it certainly applies to things like dog training, or human training    operant conditioning, and classical conditioning, and blah, blah, blah shaping and all of that. but there are cases where the elements are so intertwined, you can't change one without changing all the others. so you can't eat the elephant in one small bite at a time; you have to try to eat the whole fucking elephant.   alright, let me ask you a couple of cheesy questions just because i'm feeling the spirit move me, here. you walk into a bar. what do you order from the bartender?  jocko willink: water.  tim ferriss: water. do you not drink alcohol?  jocko willink: no.  tim ferriss: you do not. no caffeine, very limited caffeine no alcohol. are there any other things you abstain from that would surprise people, perhaps?  jocko willink: i don't think so.  tim ferriss: what type of music do you listen to when working out?  jocko willink: i  grew up listening to heavy metal and hardcore music, primarily black sabbath was kind of my indoctrination into that world.  tim ferriss: good choice.  jocko willink: i remember one of my buddies, grown up, he was praising black sabbath. and he said music throughout the history of the world has been meant to make people feel better and bring them joy, and black sabbath has absolutely nothing to do with that. that darkness, again we're going back to that theme of darkness. i think that black sabbath was the first group that i heard that i said that's what i feel, what is that? and i  latched onto it. from then, i started saying what's harder? what's darker than that? and i ended up listening to a lot of hardcore. i'll give a shout out to black flag.  tim ferriss: oh, yeah, black flag.  jocko willink: black flag, my war, side two. which,  if you listen to black flag, and even me when i was growing up, i thought yeah, these guys are okay, whatever; no big deal, punk rock. but you get to my war side two, and there was a paradigm shift and it was a completely new thing. i had black flag my war side two on my record player for maybe even a year,  where that's just what i listened to. and then again, a lot of the hardcore stuff  that i grew up listening to, i still listen to that today. it's still on my iphone and what i plug into if i was to say some of the more modern music that i listen to, i'd throw out the white buffalo.  tim ferriss: the white buffalo.  jocko willink: yeah, who is just an incredible musician? and what's incredible about him is he writes  songs and sings songs that have impact and leave a mark. he plays acoustic guitar and it's not heavy metal by any stretch of the imagination but it is hard and it is raw, and it is true. one of the few concerts i've seen in the last ten y ears has been white buffalo, white buffalo, white buffalo, and white buffalo. so i've seen him a bunch of times. every time he comes around i go and see him.  tim ferriss: i'll  have to check that out. whit e buffalo, i won't even get into it but very interesting mythological or sort of traditional native american associations with the white buffalo, also. people can google that and check it out. you can go deep looking into the stories  associated with the white buffalo, alsojust a few more questions. if you could give your 25-year-old self-advice, what would it be?  jocko willink: i'm 25 years old,  i'm at seal team one and i need to know that you don't know everything. and right now, i know that right now, that i don't know everything and that i still have a ton to learn. it's kind of like again we'll go back to jiu-jitsu, but i told that story earlier. when i first learned a couple basic moves, i thought i knew jiu-jitsu. i thought i was good.  tim ferriss: i got it.jocko willink: and now, and i've been training for 20-something years and i know  that i don't know a quarter of what i need to know or a tenth of what i need to know. and it's the same thing with everything in life. you've got to have an open mind. you've got to be ready to learn all the time. and always be seeking out that knowledgebecause it doesn't just smack you. you've got to seek it out and talk to people, and that's how you learn and get smarter.  tim ferriss: how old are you now, if you don't mind my asking?  jocko willink: i'm 44.  tim ferriss: 44. what about your 35-year-old  self?  jocko willink: now i'm in ramadi. looking back now, i would say relish that moment, which i did but i would say relish that moment.  tim ferriss: jocko, this has been fascinating and a real honor. i appreciate you taking the time. where can people find  more about you, about the book, about your company? where are the best places to visit you? and everybody listening, of course the links and so on to everything we talked about in this discussion will be at fourhourworkweek, all spelled out, fourhourworkweek.com and just click on podcast. where can people find more about you and your work online?  jocko willink: we have a facebook for the book that's coming out,  extreme ownership is where you fan find that on facebook. we have a twitter for extreme ownership, as well. leif and i are both extremely inept at social media so we're trying to make some improvements there. and as we get people interested, we'll do more. i actually have a twitter account. i think i've posted one twitter statement. it's kind of weird    i never liked people who just talk for no reason. and i kind of get the feeling when you're posting something on twitter, you're kind of talking for no reason. i don't know, maybe as people start to ask me questions on twitter and now i have a conversation, because  to just sit there and talk feels awkward to me and not right.  tim ferriss: yeah, to describe the [inaudible] you just had to perfect strangers on the internet. i'll tell you what i'll do. after we get off, i'll show you how i use twitter for extremely fast information gathering and polling, and i think you'll find that interesting.  jocko willink: i'm sure i will.  tim ferriss: because there are some very practical applications. so guys, i will link to all of this. website is - i always mispronounce this. is it echelon or eckelon?  jocko willink: it's actually echelon.  tim ferriss: echelon. e-c-h-e-l-o-n- front dot com. i will link to all this stuff but i'll say it anyway. follow jocks so that he's forced to interact on twitter, which is sort of the antithesis  of the act more, talk less ethos that i so respect. but i will show him some interesting ways to implement it. @jockowillink, so on twitter, at j-o-c-k-o w-i-l-l-i-k and extreme ownership will also be on twitter and facebook. i'll link to all this stuff but that will be in the show notes. and jocko, thanks so much. i really appreciate the time.  jocko willink: appreciate the opportunity. thank you.  tim ferriss: alright, man. we'll  get some food and to be continued. so guys, let us know what you thought. check out the book, you should really check out the book, extreme ownership. i've been reading it and very highly actionable, very easy to digest   you have lessons wrapped into stories so you have some sugar coating that will help compel this and propel this into your brain so you can actually use this information. as always, thank you for listening. until next time, learn, experiment,  test and educate yourself.", "speakers": ["jocko

and click on  podcasts", "and you can also find all previous episodes", "so without further ado, please enjoy this very intense, very insightful conversation with jocko willink   we do get into the weeds, and i implore you, i encourage you to bear with  us if we get into a bunch of military specifics because there are gems throughout this conversation", "and even if you only take one or two away, it is well worth the time invested", "so thank you for listening and please enjoy", "okay, we are livecasa ferriss", "jocko, welcome to the show", "glad to be here.thrilled to have you here", "looking at your bio and talking to people who know you, the number of topics we could discuss are many and  extremely interesting, but i'll start with this tea", "what is this", "i suppose it's a pinkish colored liquid that you've been consuming and that you've shared with me", "it's a pomegranate white tea, which i believe hits your  soul pretty well", "i was surprised because i expected to have low caffeine content", "i was like, sure i'll try the tea", "it sounds like, with the pomegranate maybe it will help with my cramps or something", "and i'm pretty well lit up, for someone who drinks pure tea,  oolong tea, i guess as sort of a veteran of indirect caffeine consumption with leaves, i've been impressed", "how long have you been drinking this", "i forget when i stumbled upon it but we used to do some desert training, back when i was in the seal teams, actually when i was running the training on the west coast", "i would have to sit through the platoon's briefs as they were getting ready to go out in the field and do a field training exercise", "the briefs were about an hour long  and we'd be on three or four hours' of sleep a night for a few days   and so at some point i discovered this stuff, and i would start drinking it when the brief kicked off", "and by the time the brief ended, i would have taken copious notes and be ready to get after the platoon commanders  that were trying to give good briefs, and i'd get after it", "you'd be fired up for feedback", "affirmative", "you mentioned that you don't normally consume caffeine", "is that true", "i do not normally consume caffeine,  no", "what are some examples of when you do consume caffeine", "what's the use of caffeine", "some kind of long drive", "even my first deployment to iraq, we did longer patrols in the vehicles and i would have, right in front of my seat so sort of hanging in front of my seat, i'd have a flash bang grenade and then another flash bang grenade, and then a frag grenade, which is the grenade that kills people, and then another frag grenade and then the next three pouches were red bull, red bull, red bull", "so if you're going on a long patrol, and i know it might seem strange that you would get tired, but you would and so you'd crack open a red bull and get after it", "and that's the kind of occasions i would save the caffeine intake for", "we haven't spent too much time together; we've been hanging out and you had an ice tea, i had a couple of coffees", "and i feel like i've just belligerently, unnecessarily, punched my adrenal glands for so many years that the coffee pretty much does nothing to mebut you're an intense  guy, which is meant as a compliment", "what are you like on three red bulls", "more jocko", "how did you get the nickname jocko", "actually, my parents gave me that nickname", "oh, they did", "yeah", "my real name is john but ever since i was born, i've been called jocko so that's what everyone knows me as", "when you,  and of course we're going to talk a lot about your time deployed and training other people, but let's take a look at your physique", "so we were introduced through  pete attia, who's also been on this podcast", "very funny, very smart guy and he said, you have to ask jock about his weight gain", "now, this is not bad weight gain because right now you're about how much, would you say", "230, 235", "230", "if you were green, you would be the hulk", "you're  a big guy and very fit", "when you entered the seals, how much did you weigh", "174", "174", "when i started seal training, i weighed 174 pounds", "how did that transformation take place", "was it just a growth spurt or were you facilitating that with resistance training", "how did that come about", "i entered seal training at 174 pounds, and  everyone's seen what seal training is like", "it's a lot of pushups, a lot of pull-ups, a lot of dips, running, swimming, obstacle course", "i just ate what they fed us, which they feed you a lot", "and in the course of seal training, i think  i graduated 185 pounds", "and once i was done with that and started getting in seal platoons, we all lifted heavy and wanted to be big and strong so i lifted heavy and ate a lot", "i was up to 200 in my first platoon and then after that i got up to about 225    now, depending on what's happening in the fight game and who i'm training with and what they're preparing for, i'll go up to 240, 245 if i need to and then come back down once those events are over", "so in other words, if i'm training a guy who's a heavyweight or fighting a heavyweight, then i'll put on some weight so i can simulate that better", "what type of training would you suggest for people, what type of regiment", "what might a workout or a week look like for someone,  let's just say a male, 25 years old who wants to add lean mass", "dead lift and squat", "dead lift and squat", "i think that's the universal answer, right", "does anyone say anything different when you ask that question", "i don't ask many people but  you have such an incredible range of weight over that period of time that i had to ask", "i think that is the right answer", "i think the eating is a lot harder than the training, in some respects, at least for me", "i'm walking around about 175 right now but  i did, to beat a friend in a bet which didn't even involve money so i'm not sure why i subjected myself to this, but i got up to 215", "the eating was the harder component", "i remember being on a deployment on a ship", "the food on a ship is not good", "you're on a six month deployment on a ship, and i was a seal and when you're on a ship as a seal, you don't have a job other than just to work out", "this is especially in the \u00f490s so it was a totally different world, the dry years because there was no war going on", "i remember we were all just trying to get huge", "i remember getting plates full of chicken mcnuggets of whatever brand they'd serve in the  navy", "i'd be just sitting there at the table after chow was done being served and i'm just looking at these chicken nuggets, and hating them and putting them in my mouth and forcing them down in order to gain weight", "so yeah", "stupid", "stupid but requires dedication and there's something to be said for that", "to use one of your terms, i'm a world-class chicken nugget eater when i need to be", "let's talk about the mma and then we're going to come back to the military", "when did you first get exposed to jiu-jitsu or martial arts", "so i'm on my first deployment in 1992 or 1993  and i'm in guamand there's an old seal master chief named steve bailey", "he was kind of known as a bad ass; in fact he was known as a bad assand the reason he was known as a bad ass is because he was a bad ass", "so this is pre-ufc no one knows anything", "and he has been training for a year or something with the gracies up in torrancehe took a bunch of us new guys and said: hey, does anyone want to learn how to fight", "and of course, absolutely  we want to learn how to fight; myself and a couple of the guys", "he was like a high level white belt, maybe even a medium level white belt but it's 1993", "no one knows anything", "it was all new", "he taught us the rear naked choke, the arm lock, how to escape the mount and possibly an americana", "posting on the chest into straight arm length", "right", "so with those moves, and being in the seal teams  it's an environment where there are lots of escalations in a platoon so you're constantly scrapping and wrestling and fighting, and that's part of it", "but with these basic maneuvers that i learned,  i could do well and it was bad ass", "so that's when i started it", "i didn't really have the vision, you know", "you couldn't see where it would go", "i thought it was a finite thing", "i know these seven moves", "everyone that's stepped  up to me now i've been able to handle; i'm goodi'm good", "and it wasn't until one of my other buddies who was a seal who was in that initial pack with me, a guy by the name of jeff higgs, and he had gotten out of the seal teams and he had just dedicated himself to training ju-jitsu", "one day he came to my house, and even when we were both idiots, he came to my house one day and he says: hey, you want to train", "and is said,  yeah, absolutely", "so we went over in the grass across the street from my house and he had just gotten his purple belt", "so you can imagine a purple belt in 1995", "unusual", "he was just completely beyond anything i knew", "he tapped me out a thousand times and i said hey, where are you training; give me the place, and that was it", "i went down the next day and signed up for unlimited classes", "i took three classes a day until the present time", "three classes a day", "i would go during lunch", "i'd go to the beginner class, i'd go to the advance  class; i would just get after it", "who was he training with", "do you recall", "fabio santos", "fabio santos", "let's flash forward to the current day", "who are the primary teachers you've trained with and what's the current status of your jiu-jitsu and training", "long story short, myself and dean lister, we ended up not being with fabio anymore, and we ended up kind of going out on our own", "dean went on his own", "i was  an active duty seal so i wasn't a full time jiu-jitsu guy", "but i was a full time main training partner for dean", "so we left, and we ended up going to a couple different schools and eventually opened a big gym down  in san diego", "and dean lister and jeff glover are our primary instructors", "what's the name of the school", "victory mma", "victory mma", "what was your experience opening  a business as an active seal", "how did your military experience help or hinder that", "i'd say it was the typical stuff", "hey, okay, let's figure out what the plan is going to be, how we're going to put it together", "it was opening a gym  you weren't building a railroad", "it was a lot less than even planning a regular seal mission in a lot of ways, which again, planning seal missions is no high, intellectual task, either", "you've got bad guys; you're  going to go kill them", "that's not super advanced", "and of course there's technology and timelines and all of that but it's not rocket sciencewe did a good job and opened up a big space and we teach a bunch of jiu-jitsu", "got it so as far as tactical implementation, not the most complex thing that you've done", "what would you put on the higher level end of complexity in terms of things that you've spearheaded  or had to tackle, up to this point", "there's two types of complexity that we could talk about herethere's the actual complexity of the mission, which again, it generally is not going to be super complex", "but what is complex is that you're dealing with human beings who have all these variables; emotions and problems and issues and egos", "that's the complexity in anything", "so from a leadership perspective, that's what i've found to be always the more challenging  thing   that's always the more challenging thing is dealing with people and getting people to conduct operations or carry out missions in a way that is most efficient, most effective, especially when they could get killed doing it", "you're asking guys to do things that are  very, very dangerous, where they know they could die", "that's what's complex", "it transfers over to the business world where it's the same thing", "you've got to get a group of people to carry out a mission in the most efficient and effective manner so they both have that in common", "i think that is usually the more complex piece, is the leadership of human beings.sure", "it makes me think of cus d'amato, who worked with tyson for so long and really took him to his first world championship belt", "he said everyone has a plan until they get hit in the face", "and i think when you have something that's very simple on paper, but there are a lot of unknown or uncontrollable variables, the  plan is just a starting point", "but then you have to adjust in the field", "and obviously when the stakes are as high as they are when you're deployed, i can see how that would be infinitely complex, potentially, depending  on how sideways things go", "how did you become a seal", "what's the story of you becoming a seal", "i grew up in new england, and i actually grew up in a little town in the sticks of new england", "i was kind of a rebellious  kid", "in fact, i was a pretty significantly rebellious kid", "and i know it seems counterintuitive but when you grow up in new england, one of the most rebellious things that a human being can do is join the military", "and almost the ultra rebellious thing you can do   i grew up with a bunch of hippies", "the kids were hippies, they were deadheads, they were smoking pot and i was not into that", "so they thought they were rebellious because  they were smoking pot and doing acid and whatnot", "and i don't know, you tell me who was more rebellious because i ended up becoming a commando for my whole life", "i think the pot and hacky sack scene, i've spent a lot of time in vermont and new hampshire", "exactly", "that seems kind of par for  the course", "it's like sort of conformist rebellion", "what was the path that you took", "at what point did you enlist", "it  was 1989 and the invasion of panama happened", "four seals were killed there", "when i saw that in the paper, i was, i guess the word would be ashamed that i was not there", "the vietnam war was over so we weren't seeing headlines all the time", "and all of a sudden there are guys who were dying for our country and i was not there", "right after that, i went down to the recruiting station and said i wanted  to be a seal", "what happens after that", "i went to boot camp, which was navy boot camp", "i got done with boot camp\u00e9", "boot camp is separate from bud/s", "it is separate", "and then you go to a school where you learn a navy  trade, and then you start bud/s", "i started bud/s in april of 1991so this was right after the gulf war", "from my perspective, leading up to the gulf war there were some reports;  i remember hearing them on the news", "they were saying there were going to be 40,000 casualties in the first 24 hours", "i don't know if you remember that, but i remember that", "i don't remember that", "i remember that because i was in the military and i was going to seal training", "i was in china when i saw the announcement on television", "so here i am thinking i'm going to go to warall these guys are going to get hurt, injured, killed and i'm going to go to war", "the war kicks off and 72 hours later it's over, and i hadn't even started seal training yet", "i  was pretty bummed out", "i know that sounds crazy but i was pretty bummed out because that's what i wanted to do with my life was be in combat and be some kind of warriorand now the chance had just dissipated in 72 hours", "but  it was the reality of what was happening", "so i went to seal training, went through and went over to seal team one", "and in boot camp, let's just say for people listening and myself, quite frankly, who are not familiar with what happens in these different phases,  what is the objective of boot camp in the case of the boot camp that you attended, and then bud/s, for instance", "because i think a lot of people are familiar with the term and they think of bud/s as a disqualifying phase", "the objective is to weed out the people who aren't suitable for combat or leadership or fill in the blank", "what are the objectives of boot camp", "boot camp is to turn  a civilian into a military human", "they teach you all this basic stuff", "i'd say the key thing they teach you in navy boot camp is attention to detail", "so you've got to do all these tasksif you're in the navy, you're working on an aircraft and if you make a mistake working on the aircraft, people die", "so  it's very attention to detail oriented, and they just teach you the basic structure of the military and imprint that on your brain", "and then seal training is what you said it is; it's weeding people out", "of  the, say, incoming - and i apologize; i'm going to massacre the terminology here", "but of the incoming class, how many people go into bud/s and how many people make it out the other end", "it's about an 80 percent attrition rate", "80 percent attrition", "so 20 percent make it through", "yes", "do you have to ring a bell", "is that an actual thing", "yes", "how does that work", "could you describe it", "they have a bell, and if you want to quit, you can quit at any timeand if you want to quit, you walk over to this bell that they carry on all the runs and  they have in the back of a truck", "if you want to quit, you go over and ring the bell and then you're done", "and then you're done", "what did you find most challenging personally in the bud/s training, if anything", "the thing with bud/s is  i was not good at anything", "i wasn't great at anything", "i couldn't run fast, i couldn't swim fast", "but i was okay at everything, which is actually better", "you didn't have a single failure point", "i didn't have these areas of huge weakness", "now  again, believe me i'm not saying i was great at anything, because i really wasn'ti finished middle of the pack on a run, in the middle of the pack of a swim", "there were some guys, a couple of guys i remember who were at the other end of the spectrum", "we had a guy who played college, ncaa water polo, and he was a phenomenal athlete and he quit because he couldn't get through the obstacle course", "i had another guy in my class who was an olympic gymnast alternate, and he quit because the water,  doing the stuff in the water got to him", "so for me, luckily i grew up on the water, i grew up in new england so i was used to the cold; that didn't do anything to me", "all you had to do was get to passing and put out as hard as you can like for the runs, i had to run as hard as i could to pass the runs", "it was a sprint", "because you couldn't modulate", "you didn't know how long the runs really were", "they'd say they were four miles but you had no idea what they were actually going to be so you just had to run as hard as you possibly could", "that's what i had to do", "right that's got to be quite a mind trip, to start a run when it's not a primary strength and know you have to go all out without having any idea of the length of the run", "you'd know it was going to be around four miles", "i don't want to make it sound like we had no idea", "but it would be four and a half miles, four and three quarter miles, whatever", "did the people who made it through, the 20 percent who made it through bud/s, did the people  who showed the most promise in bud/s end up performing best in the field", "not necessarily because bud/s is a much more athletic eventit's about athleticism, a lot of it", "a lot  of it is also don't quit", "i hear some people say everybody thinks about quitting during seal training and i absolutely did not think about quitting at any time", "there was nothing\u00e9  they could have killed me and it would have been fine  but i definitely wasn't going to quit", "but when you get to the seal team, yeah, there were some guys who were studs athletically but they were not great seals when they got to the teams", "and there are also guys who are studs athletically who were studs in the seals teams", "it's hard to put a scientific answer around that one", "we'll come back to the training because i love talking about any type of commonalities or patterns that you've spotted in a couple of different areas i'm going to ask you about the battle of ramadi but i want to first ask, where did you get this mental toughness, this not thinking of quitting even if it killed you", "was that developed through athletics  as a kid, through something else", "is your entire family like that", "where did that come from", "where did that drive and stick-to-itiveness come from", "i'm not 100 percent sure", "some of it, i remember my dad  was definitely \"you're not allowed to quit at anything, ever.\" so that leaves a mark", "also, i think i grew up and i started listening to hardcore music, and i had a hardcore attitude", "and so i think that growing up under that influence, that and watching war movies and a product of that influence, of those mantras that you'd hear in some hardcore song  that's about getting after it", "i think that left a mark, as well", "could you describe the battle of ramadi and explain what that is for people who may not even recognize the name ramadi", "ramadi is a city in western iraq, in a province called al anbar province, which is the largest province in iraq", "ramadi is the capitol city the battle of ramadi that i fought in was in 2006", "at that time, many of the insurgents had been pushed out of bagdadmany of them had been pushed out of fallujah because the marine corps did a very substantial effort through fallujah and cleared it out, and a lot of the enemy had gone to ramadi", "in the summer of 2006, the epicenter of the insurgency was in ramadi", "that's where  my seal task unit deployed to and that's where we fought", "how long were you there", "we were there for six months", "for six months", "how would you describe that experience to people", "i know that's  a very broad question but for lack of a better way to approach it, because we can really peel back the layers but when people ask you what was that like, how do you answer them", "for one thing, it was my second deployment to iraq", "my first deployment to iraq  was completely different, in that the insurgency hadn't been really, truly established yet", "this is 2003, 2004 so and so we were doing very well, at least everyone thought we were, and we were winning", "i always talk about that deployment like we were rock stars", "because 1:00 in the morning, we'd drive out of the gate and go capture a bad guy  and bring him back at 3 in the morning and it was like we were rock starts", "we had such a tactical advantage over the enemy", "it was just pretty easy   we always worked  in seals only", "it was just easy", "tough, of course; i shouldn't say easy but it was less challenging", "on that deployment, it was like we won  everything and we felt great", "we felt great about what we did", "we felt like we accomplished our mission", "and if those were the challenges of combat, as an individual i felt like i did a good job", "right, you were well equipped.i did a good job and my platoon did a good job; we did a good jobit seemed like we past a test, you know", "because at that time, we hadn't had sustained combat operations for a long time in the seal teams", "so we felt pretty bad ass.", "so now you fast forward to ramadi in 2006", "it is completely different", "there are insurgents that actually control a majority of the  city", "they have complete freedom to maneuver", "they are terrorizing - and i don't use that term lightly - they are terrorizing; they are skinning people alive, they are beheading people   they're doing what you see on tv right now with isis", "they're  doing that", "the civilian population is horrified", "there are 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day in the city of ramadi", "route michigan, which is a road that ran from east to west through ramadi, which was loosely controlled by americans, would have seven to ten ied attacks a day", "so this is statistically the most ied'd road in all of  iraq and it's three miles long", "improvised explosive device", "improvised explosive device", "so these are roadside bombs that completely caused the majority of casualties in the war in iraq and so we get there, the buildings are rubbled out", "the buildings have bullet holes in them", "there are wrecked vehicles on the streetthere are giant craters in the streets from ieds   and on top of all that, on an almost  daily basis you're going to some kind of a memorial ceremony for an american soldier or an american marine who's been killed in combat", "we rolled into that and right away i knew this is a completely different situation and we are going to fight a completely different type of battle here", "in this case, looking at your opponents, were they better trained", "or did they j just have a territorial and movement advantage that made it more difficult for you guys", "they had both", "there was a former iraqi military  base so you had a lot of former regime people there, former soldiers that were there", "they definitely controlled the terrain, without questionthey were allowed to fight in a completely different way than us and by that, i mean they have no rules", "so you're fighting against someone who has no rules, and they don't care about collateral damage", "we are very careful about collateral damage", "they don't care", "just to define that, you mean taking out civilians", "civilian casualties means nothing to them", "destroying a building means nothing to them", "killing each other, so accidentally shooting or suicide bombers", "there  were suicide bombers on the regular in ramadi", "so they have no rules", "that gave them an advantage, as well", "tactically, they did what we did", "so for example, if we get into a bad firefight, we'll  call for reinforcements, reinforcements would come to help us", "we would watch them do the exact, same thing", "if we had someone get wounded, we would call for a casualty evacuation   they'd come and pick them up and take them back to the field medical facility", "we would watch them do the exact, same  thingthey had communications, they had plans", "they would hit with complex attacks that would be coordinated throughout the city", "so at one time, they would attack three or four different coalition outposts in the city or on the outskirts of the city all coordinated not only amongst them selves, so the separate attacks would be coordinated but the individual attacks would be coordinated where they were vicious", "usually starting with machine gun fire, and then rocket propelled grenades,  and then their goal always was to get a suicide vehicle, a suicide vehicle bomb and drive it right into the compound and detonate and kill as many people as possible", "and they did this on the regular", "what was your unit on this", "seal team three, task unit bruiser", "how many people were in that unit", "in that unit you've got about 35 seals, and then  we have another 70 support people", "so these are people who help us fix our vehicles, get our intelligence, man our radios and all that", "so you've got a pretty big contingent of support people", "they're not seals; they're seal support", "got it", "so roughly 100, 105 people in total", "yes", "did those 35 seals, did they all directly report to you", "of those 35 seals, there are two seal platoons  with 16 guys each", "then we have a small headquarters element; myself and a couple other guys", "got it", "and that was the most decorate special operations unit in the iraq war", "it was", "what  separates a good commander from a great commander in an environment like that", "out of the gate, my immediate answer is humility because when you're in a situation like that, there's no way that you know everything", "it's just not possible", "and so you have to be humble enough to reach out, ask people for advice", "there had been conventional units, so big army units on the ground for years", "and when we got there, there had been a unit on the ground, the 228 iron soldiers from pennsylvania - i'm just giving them some props right now because they  were awesome   and they'd been on the ground for 14 months, fighting", "we went to those guys and we said okay, how can we help, what can we do, what advice do you have for us", "we wanted to learn what they knew", "i think  that was a big piece of it", "and also, i had an open mind when it came to the strategic mission that we were trying to accomplish", "because for many years, what seals and special  operations and the conventional units were doing was going out in the neighborhoods, grabbing bad guys and coming back to their bases   after three years of that, the enemy attacks had gone up 300 percent so clearly something was not working", "the brigade that came in and took over - gain, i'm going to give some huge compliments to the 11ad under colonel sean mcfarland", "they came in with an amazing strategy which was seize, clear, hold, and build which meant you've got these bad neighborhoods that are owned by the enemy", "and okay, we're going to go in there and we're going to stay there", "and that was a very different strategy than anyone had used", "that's the seize", "that's the  seize, clear, hold and build", "so you go into these enemy territories and you actually take over a building, or two buildings or three buildings, and you make them your house; make them your fort", "so that's what we did", "from my perspective,  for colonel mcfarland and the rest of the battalion commanders and all those commanders to have this open  mind to try out a completely new strategy, which was very, very dangerous\u00e9  very dangerous", "i'm not an expert; that sounds very risky", "it was extremely risky and a huge price was paid", "the casualties were very significant and very horrifying", "despite that overall, was that an effective strategy", "it absolutely was", "that was just the  price that it exacted", "it absolutely was", "by the time i left, we hadn't seen the results of the strategy yet", "i left october 21, 2006 and there were still about 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day about five months after we left, the enemy attacks were down to one a day, two a day", "from what was it previously", "from 30 to 50", "wow", "and then six months later, it was down to one a week, and then one a month and soon, by 2007, ramadi was the safest place in iraq, excluding maybe the kurd controlled area up in the north", "do you attribute that to anything else outside of this strategy, the seize - i apologize for forgetting the others - occupying these buildings or areas and making them your home for a period of time; were there other tactical decisions or strategies that contributed to that decrease", "obviously,  the other huge piece of this was the men and women who were fighting, and god bless them all because it was a hell of a fight", "like i said, there were significant casualties", "and the  other focus now was to take back the neighborhoods", "and in that, secure the populous", "in other wars, you say okay, here's our strategic objective; it's to take this hill or take this airfield  or what have you", "in this one, the strategic goal was to secure the populous, to make sure that the populous was safe", "because once the populous was safe, then it was okay, now we're going to give you some food, we're going to give you some waterwe have iraqi troops with us; we worked all the time with iraqi troops and they're speaking the same language", "it took a very short amount of time before that barrier got broken down and the local populous of ramadi turned against the insurgents because they no  longer feared them", "so that was the other huge tipping point, getting the local populous of ramadi on the side of the coalition", "i imagine that would give you an enormous informational advantage, also", "absolutely", "it sounds like  you have humility and openness to modifying preexisting strategies", "but then there's also an experimental piece, it sounds like", "how was the first  experiment conducted, or how did it come to pass and be implemented that you would go in and occupy and test out that particular approach", "were there other experiments like that", "i know i just asked two questions but i'm just trying to figure out in a military structure, and i haven't been exposed to that, where i'm sure there's a lot of command structures in place; were you given a lot of latitude to experiment in that way", "or did it require a lot of process", "i'll try and give a concise answer", "it doesn't have to be concise", "but you're going deep right now, which is fine because it's your podcast", "i'll take it back  to a place called al-qa'im, where the marines did a big sweep through al-qa'im and at some point when they went through al-qa'im, the local populous started saying hey, there's bad guys over there", "hey, there's bad guys in that building down there; go get them, too", "so there was a little  thought about that    now there was a place north of ramadi called tal afar, which there's a great, legendary army commander, nick masters - and i've got to look that up because i think i'm missing it", "that's okay", "people in the show notes, they can also do some research", "h.c", "mcmaster, the guy is a legendary guy", "he ran the seize, clear and hold strategy up in tal afar and it was very effective", "and again, this is pre-surge", "that  was 2005, 2006", "colonel mcfarland went and took over for him in tal afar, and got the turnover and understood what had happened", "and then colonel mcfarland got the task once mcmaster left to come down  to ramadi", "and he said i'm going to do the same thing there", "and so that's what he did", "one thing that's interesting is that it's not a  movie, and so everything was not perfect", "you'd push into some of these neighborhoods and it was fierce, fierce fighting and you know you take casualties", "i think that colonel mcfarland understood that deeply and he also had a vision for what the victory was going to look like", "those pieces and pushing in, the first time it was like hey, here's what we're goin to do", "we're going to go into this neighborhood that's controlled by the insurgents and move in    in a battle such as ramadi, how do you define objectives in the longer term, not necessarily  on a nightly basis but in the longer term so that you can focus the efforts and sustain the morale, for that matter", "that's actually a simple question", "okay, here's what we're going to do", "three days from now, we're going to go into this neighborhood", "we're going to establish a combat outpost,  and that's what we're going to focus on for the next three days", "and once we get that thing established, guess what", "we're going to spend four or five days there and then we're going to do it againgrand picture, strategic vision, here's what it's going to look like   we're going to have combat outposts all over ramadi that are going to be controlled by americans with iraqi soldiers with them who can go out and talk to the local populous and we can secure this city", "it was as simple as that", "now, you take that down a level to, let's say, one of my seal platoons and they'd be saying: okay, here's what we're going  to do", "we're going to go and take this particular building, and then we're going to cover for the conventional units as they come in in a very exposed way   because when you build these combat outposts, you're literally doing a construction project in the middle  of a combat zone", "so these guys, these brave army engineers are standing with a hammer in their hand, full body armor, reinforcing these buildings, loading sand bags,  building barricades", "this is while we're being attacked", "and so those guys, like i said, i can never give enough credit to the units that we worked with there in ramadi", "they were phenomenal and brave", "what we would do is while they were doing those missions building out those combat outposts, we would go out to the high ground surrounding the combat outposts   so we'd sneak out into the areas surrounding the combat outpostso now when the enemy  came to attack the combat outpost, we would kill them", "and they didn't know where we were in the beginning", "eventually, they'd figure out where we were and come attack", "what was the d of expertise like among the 35 seals under your command, and again, i have to apologize because what i know of seals, some of it has come from guys  who have been deployed who are friends of mine but a lot of it comes from seeing films", "it's a lot of the exposure that civilians have here", "and some people say yeah, that guy's a door kicker, this guy's this, this guy is that", "how did the responsibilities break down across those 35", "it's two seal platoons", "each seal platoon has a single leader who's in charge of the whole platoon, and he's got some subordinate leadership underneath him", "and then you've  got these guys who have their specialty craft, whether they're snipers, whether they're medic guys, corpsmen, whether they're breachers, which are guys who blow things up, blow open doors, riflemen, grenadiers, point  men", "so you've got these various skill sets inside", "i apologize; what is the riflemen and then what was the other", "grenadier", "are they the same", "it depends", "a rifleman is basically a guy with a rifle, which we generally wouldn't  have because almost every guy in a seal platoon is doing something other than just shooting his gun", "like i said, he's a radioman so he's calling in for fire, calling tanks, calling casualty evacuation; anything like that", "the sniper is being a sniper", "the machine gunners are machine gunners", "a grenadier lobs grenades at people", "that's what a seal platoon isinow, the experience level in the seal platoon is you've got guys who have never deployed before, and  we had probably out of 30 whatever guys, we probably had a dozen who had never deployed before", "so this was their first deployment to iraq", "it was pretty epic, first deployment to iraq", "and then you've got guys  who have varying level of experience inside the platoons", "some guys had deployed to iraq one, two, or three times", "that's probably the level of experience", "what  were the sizes of groups that would go out on, say, a nightly raid or something like that", "and again, i apologize", "i'm playing the civilian role here so i'm not going to get everything right", "but would the core group be like a six or seven\u00e9", "we would task organize depending on the mission", "it's important to remember we were working with iraqi forces", "so we had these other people with us that we could use as bodies to do some of the work we'd send six, seven, eight, nine, ten seals out with eight, ten, 12, 20, 40 iraqis and it's the whole spectrum because sometimes we'd send an entire seal platoon out,  16 guys with 40 iraqi soldiers or 50 iraqi soldiers", "and sometimes we'd send five seals out with five iraqi soldiers to do some kind of an over watch position, a little smaller", "but we still had a minimum that we needed to take out", "what is an over watch position", "over watch position is what i talked about earlier where you get the high ground, or maybe not necessarily the high ground but often the high ground", "that's the tactical advantageous position on the battlefield is to be on the high ground", "who are other people in the military, alive or dead, u.s", "or elsewhere who you really respect as strategists or tacticians", "obviously,  i talked about colonel sean mcfarland, who was just fantastic", "and i don't know if i'm necessarily right on this but general petraeus, who wrote the manual on counter insurgency, so he's  obvious and he orchestrated the surge and he's brilliant", "and in my opinion, he was the critical player in really turning the rest of the war", "again, we were pre-surge but i think they used the  success in ramadi as a reason to sell the surge", "like we can do this in other places; we did it in ramadi", "so from my perspective, both of those guys were just outstanding", "the reason i was asking about the smaller groups that are sent out, the eight to ten seals with the iraqi colleagues, what distinguishes  a good leader in that type of situation or in bud/s or elsewhere", "what have you observed and learned about what makes a good leader versus a good or a mediocre or a bad leader", "again, the immediate answer that comes to mind is humilitybecause you've got to be humble, and you've got to be coachablewe would fire guys", "later, when i was running training, we  would fire a couple leaders from every seal team because they couldn't lead", "and 99.9 percent of the time, it wasn't a question of their ability, it was a question of their ability to listen and their ability to step outside and see that maybe there's a better way to do things", "so that's number one", "and number two i would say is an individual who is balanced   there's a phrase that i use, the dichotomy of leadership", "so in  a leadership situation, you're constantly balancing these opposing forces", "do you have to be aggressive", "absolutely", "can you be too aggressive", "yes, you can", "do you need to be courageous", "yes, you do", "can you be foolhardy  and get people killed", "absolutely", "so there's all these balances", "can you be too close to your men", "yes, you can", "can you be not close enough", "yes, you can", "can you be too robotic", "yes, you can", "can you be too emotional", "absolutely    what i find the best leadership, they have this ability to balance all those opposing forces", "and usually, when you do find a problem, if you realize that your leadership isn't working, generally you can look and say i'm going too far in one direction on this particular force, this dichotomy of leadership", "i'm going too far", "i'm being overbearing", "i'm micro managing", "micro managing is a great one, right", "you can obviously micro manage your people  and they won't do anything on their own; they won't take any initiative and that's horrible   the other end is you cannot give them the guidance that they need and not pay close enough attention to them, and now they don't know what the mission is or what they're doing", "so there's  all these dichotomies that you have to balance as a leader", "and i think that between being humble and balancing all those dichotomies of leadership is what makes a good leader", "how would the ability to listen and be coachable,  what would be an example of how that manifests itself", "just how you would observe that and say that's a guy who's good at being humble and coachable, or the opposite", "i'm looking for the things that you would observe or hear, where you'd be like, you know what, i think we might have to let that guy go", "again, now we're going back to training", "we put these guys through very realistic and challenging training, to say the leastand i know if there are any guys who went through training when i was running it, right now they're chuckling  because it was very realistic, psychotic", "we put so much pressure on these guys and overwhelmed them", "a good leader would come back and say i lost it, i didn't control  it, i didn't do a good job", "i didn't see what was happening   i got too absorbed in this little tiny tactical situation that was right in front of me", "either they'd make those criticisms themselves about themselves,  or they'd say what did i do wrong", "and when you told them, they'd nod their head, they'd pull out their notebook, they'd take notes", "and that right there, that's a guy who's going to make it, who's going to do it right", "then you get the guy who comes in and you'd say what did you think of the operation", "and if it was a disaster, he'd say it was a disaster", "and you'd say, what went wrong", "and immediately it's my assault team leader didn't do x, and my mobility commander  didn't do y", "and i told those guys i wanted them over there and they didn't go there", "finger pointing", "immediately finger pointing and that's just a telltale sign that you've got a guy who's not humble enough and coachable, and it's  an awful thing", "you can try and change people, and sometimes they would change but it's difficult to get them to change", "some people are born with that characteristic and it's a bummer to see", "if you can't fix them, you can't fix them, and they're not going to listen to anybody", "it sounds like  self-awareness is also a big component of that, to have the awareness to kind of step outside and objectively evaluate yourself", "i call it detachment", "that's one of the things that early on in my leadership career, i actually remember when it happened", "i was probably 22 or 23 years old", "i was in my first seal platoon we're on an oil rig in california doing some training", "we come up on this level of this oil rig and we've never been on an oil rig before", "they're very complex", "there's gear and boxes and just stuff everywhere on these levels,  and they're see through", "you can see through the floors", "it's a complex environment   we come up and we all get on this platform on this level, and everybody freezes", "i'm kind of waiting, and i'm a new guy so i  don't really feel like i should be doing anything", "but then i said to myself, somebody's got to do something", "so i just did what's called high porting my gun", "i lifted my gun up towards the air, like i'm not a shooter right now", "i took one step back off the line and looked around and i saw what the picture was", "and i just said hold left, move right   and everybody heard it, and they did it", "and i said to myself, hmm,  that's what you need to do", "and so i realized that detaching yourself from the situation\u00e9  so you can observe it", "\u00e9 so you can see what's happening is absolutely critical", "and now, when i talk to executives or mid-level managers, i explain to them that i'm doing that all the time", "it sounds horrible but it's almost like sometimes i'm not a participant in my own life", "i'm an observer of that guy who's doing it", "so if i'm having a conversation with you and we're trying to discuss a point, and i'm watching and saying wait, are you being too emotional right now", "wait a second, look at him   because i'm not reading you correctly if i'm seeing you through my own emotion or ego", "i can't really see what you're thinkingbut if i step out of that, now i i can see the real you and if you are getting angry, if your ego is getting hurt, if you're about to cave because you're just fed up with me", "whereas if i'm raging in my own head, i might miss all of that", "and so that detachment that takes place as a leader is critical, and you're 100 percent right on that", "how do you instill or try to teach that", "i feel like that may be more than the humility", "it seems to be a coachable skill", "part of the reason i say that is because i've found that whether it's cognitive behavioral therapy, or stoic philosophy, for that matter, you can, in small increments, condition people to have less of an extreme emotional response, to try to observe themselves", "and i suppose there's some buddhist thought that would translate to that, as wellhow do you help teach someone that ability to detach", "what we did to teach them was put them under extraordinary pressure where to fail to detach from the situation and step up and away from the problem would result in failure", "i had a great experience where the guy who actually took over my job as the troop commander, a very close friend of mine", "he was going through the training and i was running the training", "we were going out to a place called niland, california to do land warfare   and again, this is desert operations", "you're patrolling in long distancesyou're hitting targets", "we have high level laser tag guns that we use to shoot", "we put a lot of pressure on people", "there are helicopters, there's smoke, there are bombs, there's all kinds of stuff happening", "and this guy, this buddy of mine, he was supposed to be commanding it all but he had broken his neck about six weeks prior to this", "was that on like a ropes course, or coming out of a helicopter", "he was climbing the ship and the guy above him fell and he broke his neck", "so this guy, who had been in ramadi with me  and did an outstanding job and amazing effort, and was brave to a fault; we're lucky he's here", "the land warfare  training takes place, and i said hey, just come out and watch with me", "so he comes out and we're watching, and we're out on one of these field training exercises   so all this mayhem starts", "there are bad guys up in the hills, bombs are going off, and there's  smoke everywhere", "but from our position, which we were standing next to the guys who were in it, and he looks at me and says it's so easy when you're to in it", "and i said, this is how it was for me when we went through", "i was up here", "and it was like a light bulb went off", "he was like, i saw youhe kind of saw me like that and said how does he know what's happening right now", "so easy insomuch  as when you're the outsider looking in, you can see what to do; what's going on", "exactly", "and when you did it, you were not necessarily physically removing yourself but mentally pulling the perspective back so that you could observe it", "so if you take someone like your friend  who has this realization, like holy shit, okay, that explains a lot", "if you could create this perspective, you would have a huge tactical advantage", "what type of exercise would  you put someone through where the consequences were so significant that they would be forced to detach in that way", "these are just exercises that we'd do", "and like i said, we would use lasers", "we had this advance laser tag system where you can get shot at 300 meters", "if you get shot at niland and your beeper goes off and says you're dead, then you're dead", "you're going to have to get carried out by your buddies, which is awful, and they're going to get hurt, sprained ankles and everything else; it's a nightmare", "and also now they can't maneuver as well   so now what happens when they get attacked again, which they're going to because it's going to be murphy's law out there and the problems compound", "and if the leaders get bogged down  in those problems and don't step back, we would kill all of them", "and they'd come back with their heads down and say, what the hell just happened and what can we do better", "and we'd have this talk with them", "it's one of those things", "it's like when you're growing up and you don't listen to anybody   not that you don't listen, but some lessons you have to learn through life and experience", "and so that happened", "guys at varying levels, some of them would be able to say i just saw it; okay, now i can make this happen", "and that would happen, as well, where i could see\u00e9 like in terminator, at the beginning they said", "\"on august 27, 2016,  the machines became aware.\"    you could see their leadership switch happen, and all of a sudden they'd go boom", "and then i would know my job was done", "they'd step up, they'd take a step back from the situation, they'd look around, they'd observe, they'd make good decisions and good calls and then i'd watch them progress out of it and finish the problem and do well", "and then i knew i had done my job", "they had become aware", "they became aware as  leaders, yes", "this is, in my mind at least, related to not panicking or at least being able to think in the midst of panic", "there are so many examples of this in sports and elsewhere, but i remember doing some convoy and evasive driving training with a bunch of executive types - these are not military guys - just really for the experience", "part of the training involved splitting up into two teams, having sort of an ambush team and trying to go get a broken down car with a person passed out inside - they might be dead, they might be passed out - back through basically a finish line", "we got to pick teams, and i happened to be one team leader", "i picked the guy who had the best evasive driving skills to be the victor one driver, and i was in the passenger side with the commseverybody had paintball guns we had to keep the passenger side and driver's side windows down so we could get nailed", "there were also drivers trying to take us off the road and whatnot", "in any case, as soon as the paintballs started flying, this guy just gunned it in a straight line   no response to comms, no response to anything even though under the pressure of mock competition with the evasive driving and so on within cones, he'd been spectacular", "how do you either pick people who are less  likely to have that just go into a kind of blind red zone where they're unresponsive, or prepare people and condition them so they can actually function when the shit starts hitting the fan", "that's  exactly right what you just said", "we desensitized them to being in horrible situations and we conditioned them and kept putting that pressure on them until they can get through it", "got it", "so it's a  matter of exposure, mostly", "and most guys do", "most guys, they go okay, i'm used to this", "and then it will be up a level", "for real, it will be up a level", "and most guys will be good there, too; you'll have a couple fall out", "but the seals teams does a very good job of applying that pressure of conditioning you and desensitizing you to horrible situations so that you can deal with it when it comes", "we're just going to shift gears a little bit, and i know we're going to bounce around a lot but i've heard of your workouts when you're deployed", "one guy said - i don't know if this is true - that you would roll with 20 guys in a platoon as a workout and just tap out like 20 guys", "is that true", "yeah", "you're rolling with guys who don't know anything", "and so in order to get good training in, i would just have guys come in every 15 minutes", "i remember this particularly when i was at team two", "i would just have the guys come in every 15 or 20 minutes and just roll with them, and then another guy would come in", "so yeah", "but i was better than them at jiu-jitsu", "it's not that i was any tougher; i just knew more", "of course you know many good competitors in jiu-jitsu mma, when you  look at the top performers in that world and then some of the top performers you've met in the seal world, what are the commonalities, if any", "let me talk about jiu-jitsu first", "one thing  i noticed about jiu-jitsu is when you get to the world class level of jiu-jitsu guys, there is a stratification there between guys who have  a natural, god given ability that is above and beyond normal human\u00e9 it's above and beyond what a normal human being would do or should be able to do", "and there are not many of those people", "who comes to mind when you think of that", "i think hixson gracie, who i've trained with", "i was a blue  belt when i trained with him but you could feel that this guy is not normal", "dean lister, who was my training partner forever and i've rolled with guys from all over the world and dean lister is at another level", "i've never rolled with  marcello garcia but just from watching him in competition, you can see that he has that, as wellthere's not a large group of people at that level   and the next level down is guys who train like maniacs, and they're great athletes and they're awesome, too", "those guys are the world champions, etc", "so that's my estimation", "and having rolled with guys on both ends of the spectrum, dean is an example because dean has won world championships training a miniscule amount compared to what a normal person  would have to train to get there", "which i don't know if that's a compliment or a negative but it's true   now, in the seal teams, as far  as the high performers, i think it's the people who it's a certain level of focus, i think, and again a certain level of open-mindedness and a certain level of  dedication to the task and to the craft that they're dealing with", "you get guys who are just super passionate about the job", "and if you're super passionate about the job in the seal teams, there's a really good chance you're going to be one of the top performers", "because you're going to put in all that extra effort to do well", "what are you world class at that people might not realize", "first of all, i think world class is a strong word", "it's a strong word", "because i'd say i'm world class at just about nothing", "as far as what people might not know about me, one thing that's interesting about me is i live a fairly compartmentalized life, where my  jiu-jitsu friends would not meet my seal friends, who would not meet the people who i work with in a leadership situation or in a civilian sector business world", "there are people who don't know that i'm a really good jiu-jitsu player or that i work with big  companies and help their leadership   so there's that", "but if i had to say the skill set that i have that i think helped me was, number one, taking complex things and making them simple, and then being able to communicate that simplicity to other people is number one", "and number two, the ability that we already talked about to detach myself from situations emotionally and mentally, usually not physically   you have to be able to do it without detaching physically", "but those things would be what i would say are my talents, if i had any because i'm definitely not the fastest, not the strongest, not the most flexible or whatever, and not the smartest", "but it seems like - very interesting - madonna would say the same thing, like i'm not the best dancer, i'm not the best singer,  i'm not the best this", "but i think like yourself, she's kind of a five tool player, like a baseball player who can hit for power, hit for getting on base, can field, etc., etc", "and it's the collection of those tools that makes you, say, a world class commander or something like that", "what do your morning routines look like", "on an ideal day, what does the first 90 minutes of your day look like", "when do you wake up", "what does that look like", "i wake up early", "i wake up at 4:45", "i like to have that psychological win over the enemyfor me, when i  wake up in the morning and i don't know why, i'm thinking about the enemy and what they're doingand i know i'm not active duty anymore but it's still in there, that there's a guy that's in a cave somewhere and he's rocking back and forth and he's got a machine gun in one hand and a grenade in the other hand, and he's waiting for me and we're going to meetiwhen i wake up in the morning, i'm thinking to myself what can i do to be ready for that moment which is coming, which  is comingso that propels me out of bed", "i work out early in the morning", "so you wake up at 4:45", "what's the next thing, aside from brushing your teeth and doing the usual", "i  do the usual, start working out", "ideally, i like to get done with my workout by the time the sun comes up", "so now if there's waves, i live by the ocean so i'll go surfing and get done with that", "what does  the typical morning workout look like", "i do a lot of pull-ups, pushups and dips", "i dead lift and do squats", "i do sprints", "it's everything that everybody does", "i swing kettle bells, i do burpees", "it's all that", "it's like a 60 minute workout", "how long is the workout", "it depends on what's going on", "i'll try and do some strength movements to be strong; dead  lifts, cleans, clean and jerks, something like that to make myself stronger", "or even if it something like just dead hang pull-ups and i'm just maxing out but i'll do something like that to make myself stronger", "and sometimes that can take awhile because i'll just want to relax  and hit singles or doubles on dead lifts or cleans or whatever   then when i get done with that, i'll do some kind of metabolic conditioning of some kind", "i'll be sprinting or rowing or swinging a kettle bell  or lighter weight clean and jerks for reps or something like that", "that's what it looks like for me", "so you finish training when the sun comes up, hit the waves, since they're there, which is a good policy", "what happens then", "i'll come back and start doing normal human stuff", "that's when the work begins, the professional\u00e9  i have a leadership and management consulting business so i'll have  clients to talk to, emails to push out", "i'll start taking care of that business", "i normally don't get hungry until 10 or 00 in the morning", "so  around 10 or 00 i start wanting to start to graze on some food, and i'll do that", "by noon, i'm feeling pretty hungry like i need some lunch", "what does your diet generally look like", "it  generally looks like steak", "steak", "and chicken and salad", "paleo-ish", "yeah", "i'm no stranger to having some mint chocolate chip ice cream or some ovaltine or whatever", "again, i'm not a competitive body builder so i'll eat some normal food", "right, you can indulge when the spirit  moves you", "when you think of the word successful, who are the first people or the first person that comes to mind", "for me,  the part of the world that i've seen is a very dark placeit's a dark place", "that's what war is", "when  your job, which my job was, was to expand that darkness in many ways, war is about killing people", "so for me, when i look to someone that's successful, it's someone that brings some light into that darkness so for me, the first people that come to my head are mark lee, who is one of my guys, first seal killed in iraq, mike monsor,  second seal killed in iraq, posthumously awarded the medal of honor, and ryan jobe, one of my guys wounded in iraq, blinded in both eyes   made it home, medically  retired from the navy, married his high school sweetheart, got her pregnant and finished his college degree", "and after his 22nd surgery to repair the damage that was done to his head and face, there were complications and he died, as well", "but all of those guys, in all that darkness,  they did things, they made a sacrifice that was completely selfless and to do that and to live and fight and die like a  warrior, that to me is successand those guys are my heroes", "what do you struggle with", "and i ask that because we've only just met but it's hard for me as a civilian to fathom what you and  your friends have been through; impossible for me to fathom", "it makes me just feel ashamed for ever complaining about a bad day or a hard day, given what you guys have  experienced and the stakes that are involved, and the sacrifices and the sadness and tragedy that is a part of that job   what do you struggle with, whether it's in the business sphere  or just in life in general, if you're open to talking about it", "i used to, when i had these icons in my head, i was like oh, my god, richard branson, he's got it al figured out, he's doing everything perfectly, he's on cruise control hitting home runs every time he gets at batand as i've slowly gotten to know obviously not branson directly, although i have met him before, i realize that people all have - and this is something you talked about  detachment   i've always had impatience and anger issues and it's helped me to be aggressive in sport and in business and in negotiation", "but it's also caused some problems for me", "but i've realized  that one of the ways i can tone that down is by realizing everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about in some way", "what are the things that you find difficult or that you struggle with, or have struggled with", "it's  an interesting question, and this is a filler answer, in case you couldn't tell that", "because when i start off with \"it's an interesting question,\" that means i'm not really quite sure what to say", "i've been lucky", "i've been blessed", "i've  had a life that i would not trade with anyone in the world", "when you talk about ramadi, that was the highlight of my life because i was leading men in combat, which was  something that i always wanted to do and something that i felt that i was destined to do   and when i was in that situation, i knew that", "i don't look back and say i wish i would have enjoyed that", "no, i knew it then", "this is it this is what you have been waiting for your whole life and what you really have been preparing for your whole life", "i was lucky to be there and i was lucky to have incredible guys to work with, both in my unit and in the other units in the army and the marine corps that we worked with", "i was lucky enough to have guys who were so brave and so dedicated", "i will use  the word fearless, not that they didn't have fear but that they overcame it all the time   so i'd say if there's anything that i struggle with now, it's just that does  anything else matter", "and the answer is no", "the answer is no, nothing else matters", "nothing else is close so i have to deal with that", "struggle is a strong word because i don't sit there at night, wishing i was back - well, okay, i do do that sometimes", "i often wish i was back", "but i don't dwell on it because it's gone i'm so happy that i could be a part of it and that i was able to work with such tremendous guys", "i try and keep their memory alive  every day in my own head", "how did you, when you were active, reconcile the risks that are inherent in that job with family, with  your family", "first of all, when i was young, i thought that i was going to die", "i thought i was going to die in combat", "there was no war going on; this was ignorant thoughts", "this was young, stupid, unknowledgeable idiot saying i'm never even going to make it to 30", "and i was good with that because i had nothing", "i was a single guy who wanted to go out and destroy the world; that's awesome   then as i got older and i realized i'm actually going to live to be 30 and probably 40, i had to work through thati  got married along the way, had kids, and when i had kids, i actually felt more ready to die because i had left children", "and so i actually felt like i was okay with that", "which i guess that's bad, but men have  been traveling and fighting for thousands and thousands of years, since the beginning of mankind", "and i knew that as a warrior, that's okay   and sometimes men don't come home, and the families drive on and that's the way the world works", "so i didn't really have much to reconcile there", "now, as far as division of time and having a family, i can tell you i  was very lopsided and unbalanced in that situation", "the seal teams to me was everything, and nothing else mattered", "well, i shouldn't say it didn't matter but it was definitely on a much lower priority", "i  remember actually my wife sent me an email when i was on deployment   she's very independent, doing her thing and she sends me an email that says something along the lines of hey, send us a picture  of where you sleep", "fair enough; show the kids where i sleep at nightand so i went up to my room", "we had some old saddam palace that we had taken over, not really a palace; a saddam house that we had taken over and that's where we lived, and i had one of the rooms in this building", "so i went up and i took some digital pictures of my bed", "i looked at them and i said wait a second   i went into a folder that i had, and i pulled it out and i took out pictures of my wife and kids and i hung them up on  the wall", "and i took pictures and i sent those home, and i took the pictures back down", "because i didn't want to be thinking about my  wife and kids when i had men's lives at stake", "that's how i compartmentalized and did what i had to do, which was be dedicated to my guys, to the mission,  and to the country   at that point in time, it had to take priority over everything", "it took priority over everything", "my guys, they had families they had to go home to", "i can't be thinking about this other stuff", "so there's a little reconciliation", "now that you've entered the civilian world, are there particular non military leaders, whether they're ceos or maybe outside of the private sector you admire or look to in some way as role models", "you meet these guys and girls, and a lot of them might as well have been in the seal teams", "they're aggressive, they're making things happen and yeah, i admire and learn from them all the timeand i think they get the same thing from me, and t hat's why i'm in business", "so absolutely america is the greatest country on earth and capitalism is one of the things that makes this country so great   and those folks who run these businesses are part of that fabric that makes america great", "so absolutely, they're incredible people and they have the same faults that seals have, and they make the same mistakes", "they get involved with emotionally with stuff and their ego gets in the way, of course; just like  it happens with seals it happens with them", "they make the same mistakes where they don't explain the mission to their troops   or they don't break it down from a strategic level to a tactical level so the people on the front line can understand", "so it's all the same mistakes and again, that's kind of why we're in business now", "right, humans will be humans", "group dynamics will be group dynamics", "exactly", "unfortunately, that is correct", "when you were talking about the detachment, it made me think of  quite a few years ago when i had my first sort of frivolous lawsuit come in, which completely paralyzed me", "i was so intimidated and shocked and fearful", "it ended up getting completely tossed out but it took a long time and a lot of money", "i ended up developing migraines, i started clenching my jaw to the point where i had these shooting pains and i had to get a mouthpiece", "it caused a whole cascade of health problems  and issues   i remember talking to a number of my buddies who had been in business for decades at very high levels", "one of them, i won't give his full name away but pete, really hilarious but brilliantly effective executive, he goes: timmy,  you're too fucking nice", "i should have sued you just because you should get used to it", "and he started stalking me, treating it like such a non event", "it was just such a non event for him", "i couldn't compute it at the time but now i've just realized some of these  things are a cost of doing business   and if you're going to be aggressive and push the envelope, and step into environments that are uncertain because that's where a lot of rewards are potentially, you're going to deal with these thingsso now i'm at a point where i've been exposed to that enough times, not necessarily frivolous lawsuits but just legal headaches because that's sort of a side effect of having a very vigorous free market is on the one hand you have some legal complications   what  i've tried to figure out for myself, spending time with people who have been deployed and done the realistic training that you've referred to, some of which is just beyond intense  as they've described it to me, i've wanted to take myself out of this sort of keyboard shackled experience from day to day and expose myself to more of these stresses to try to toughen myself and inoculate myself against future uncertainty and things like that", "what are skills or experiences that you think every man should have", "there's a whole list of those", "i'm interested because quite frankly, i feel like - and i've had female friends say this to me, where they're like you know, i meet a lot of guys, i date  a lot of guys but there just aren't many men out there anymore", "which we could deep really far into that, and there's all sorts of complicated gender questions and topics that could raise", "but just putting all of that aside for the time being, i think a lot of folks like myself,  even, and i experienced this when i was doing the four hour chef and really got back into doing hunting and field dressing and trying to build things and working with fire   i was like wow, i feel like i'm slowly becoming maybe barely manually literate,  compared to my great grandfather who was chopping wood every day, building stuff, fixing things that broke, etc", "what would be on that list in your mind", "if guys are listening to this saying you know what, i want to toughen the fuck up just a little bit", "if you were bare bones basic, you're talking food, shelter and water, right", "do you have the skills to bring those things to the table and make them happen", "i think that's a very basic place to start", "i can tell you that from my perspective,  and i actually gave a speech at one of my buddies' weddings", "i said that there were three things in my life that made me feel like a man when i say feel like a man, it doesn't mean bow up and feel like a man; it actually means the opposite", "it actually means i'm confident enough that i don't need to bow up and i don't need to\u00e9  bow up meaning puff up your chest", "puff up my chest and  i'm a bad ass", "the first one was actually jiu-jitsu", "it was learning how to fight and knowing that there's not a question that if i get into an altercation, i can handle myself; 100 percent", "because when you don't know jiu-jitsu, or you don't know how to fight, then you question that in the back of your mind", "and how do you answer that question", "you act like an asshole", "these are the guys who run around in a bar getting in fights with people because they don't know", "they're not confident that they can handle themselves", "so that was number one", "number two is going into combatbecause again, there was a big question mark of you don't know for sure how  you're going to react in those situations", "i felt pretty good that i knew how i was going to act, but you need to check the box", "and so i checked that box and i knew that i  was going to do fine, and then i did fine and i was brave and not scared and was to detach myself, and make decisions, and make things happen", "so that was good", "and then the last one was getting married and having kidsbecause now all of a sudden i have other humans that are directly relying on me as their sole kind of leader and realizing that this is the most important thing", "you have to make this the most important thing in your life", "and you're out of that game, too", "so you're no longer trying to impress a girl or whatever because you've got a girl", "and so there's a level  of i don't care anymorethose three things for me were kind of where i was able to say i'm good; now let's focus on being a good guy and moving forward.those were three good ones", "on the jiu-jitsu side, that's the only one i can speak to, having done a little bit here and there and also moytoy and whatnot", "i think it's so valuable on so many levels because not only do you know you can handle yourself but if you think you're a tough guy and you go to a good gym, you get taught really quickly how un-tough you are", "i just remember, for instance, i was training at fairtex ages ago  here in san francisco, and one of the guys who is a trainer, his name is enn, e-n-n", "he was as southpaw so i trained with him because i'm a southpaw   the most unassuming little dude you've ever seen in your life, calves the size of my torso but otherwise, you would never guess in a million years", "and he had terrible fashion sense he'd wear these huge baseball caps that would cover his entire head so he looked like he was about 7 years old", "he was only five foot one, five foot two", "huge, baggy tee shirt and baggy pants so he just looked like average guy who's going to be some  type of manual laborer and people would mistake him for being mexican", "i just remember he went out to this bar because the gym was on clementina street, which was between howard and folsom, between 5th and 6th, which was a terrible place to be when i was training there", "in fact, alex gong the owner, was shot in the chest and killed basically while i was there", "i remember that", "by  a guy stuck in traffic; it's an insane story", "but suffice it to say, he goes out to a bar and i was at a fly-in camp at the time with a bunch of other guys", "this guy pulls a knife on one of the other trainers, why, who knows everybody kind of backs up and there are two groups facing each other", "one of the guys is like, i'm gonna fuck you up, to enn who is a tiny little guy   and he just throws the nastiest, round ass kick you can imagine,  basically breaks the guy in half like just a lego figure being broken by a gorilla", "that was just the showstopper", "i think once you train with people like that, you're like i am never going to pick a fight", "because you never know who the enn is", "that's absolutely true", "i think it's also that confidence and that humility transfers to so many other areas because you realize like wow, i thought i was the cat's meow, i thought i was the king of the hill in areas a, b, c, d, or e but you know what", "that's probably not the case", "on the combat side of things, what are stressful experiences that  a civilian might expose themselves to that could i know to perfectly simulate it but to perhaps give them that type of fear inoculation or conditioning on some level", "i think any of those  rock climbing, parachuting, anything that has a real danger to it, which both of those things can and do", "i think those can definitely help", "i would say those are a couple good examples", "i'm sure we could sit here and brainstorm about it", "we could say paintball", "but there's no real risk in paintball; there's just zero", "so it's cool and you can definitely get  somewhat conditioned to that panic and that stress level because it hurts when you get hit by a paintball: ow, ow, ow", "but it's not the fear of death", "the fear of death is, i guess, the real  thing that we're talking about", "that's the benchmark", "you overcome that fear of death and then what else is there to be afraid of now", "you and i are sitting here, we're in my house and you noticed the musashi  that i have out over there, this historical novel about miyamoto musashi", "i don't know where it came from and i can't really pinpoint it but the reason i have that there is to remind me that if you're constantly afraid of death, you're paralyzed in so many facets of your life, it really prohibits you from making even effective decisions", "so one could say you should love your family and have the photos up and it's like well, if i really want to love my family and go home to  see my family, maybe i shouldn't have those up as something that's going to occupy a part of my brain; i need to be effective in the field for me and my men", "no doubt about it", "so it's thinking not about that first move that looks good on paper and to everyone around you, but  thinking about the second, the tertiary effect, etc", "are there any books that you've gifted to other people or what do you gift to someone", "so for books, i think there's only one book that i've ever given and i've only given it to a couple people", "that's a book called about face, by colonel david hackworth", "it is huge", "have you ever heard of it", "i haven't, and i was just looking for\u00e9 oh, wait", "here's my pad", "interestingly, i looked for it today to see if i could download a digital copy and i don't think it's available digitally, which surprised me", "so colonel david hackworth, the tail end of world war ii he was in korea", "he was highly decorated in korea", "he joined the merchant  marines or something when he was 15 and got into the army, again, right after world war ii", "so he kind of got raised by those world war ii veterans", "and then he was in korea, and he was in vietnam, and he was just absolutely  borderline worshipped by the men that he led and by some of the senior leadership", "just a great book", "he was a rebel, you know", "and he did question the way we were doing things", "and what's controversial about him is that he's the guy who said to walter cronkite, or he's the first guy in vietnam who said we're not going to win this thing so he's kind of blacklisted by much of the army", "but as you dig into that, what he was really saying was we're not going to win this thing if we keep fighting how we're fighting   he recognized that we needed to do a significant paradigm shift in the strategy  that we were executing over there", "it's like you've heard we've never lost a tactical battle in vietnam", "you've heard that, right", "yes", "and there are plenty of people who will say that all day long", "but if you and i are leading a platoon,  and we take our platoon out and we hit a booby trap and it kills three of our guys, or two of our guys and wounds another three, and there's no one to shoot at", "we medevac those guys and we come back to base", "who won that", "he recognized that", "so the metrics that were being used were not a smoke screen but they were at best the wrong metrics, in a lot of cases", "i had that book next to my bed in ramadi", "i literally read it every  night", "that's how i'd fall asleep", "i'd go up, read a couple pages, just open to any page and you'd find something", "it was very comparable", "they were working with the south vietnamese army and guess what", "they were corrupt, and they were scared, and they weren't the best soldiers and we were working with iraqis  and guess what?i they were corrupt, and they were scared, and they weren't the best\u00e9 there were so many parallels between the two", "so that's the book that i've given to a couple close friends of mine that i wanted them to have", "about face", "the other book that i've read  multiple times is blood meridian", "i don't know that one", "it's written by cormac mccarthy", "oh, fantastic writer", "this is his best book", "and i was an english major in college so i was forced to read all kinds of books", "obviously, shakespeare is kind of the pinnacle in my mind", "cormac   mccarthy is the guy that i think actually has that", "and if you read blood meridian, there it is", "what i find so gripping about it is  i talked earlier about the darkness of the world", "this is an historical novel based on the group called the glanton gang that were killing indians and they ended up killing everybody", "if you had black hair, your scalp was going to be taken   that's what it's about, and it's completely epic", "but for me, it communicated to me a guy, cormac mccarthy, was able to show the darkness in humanity and there's nothing pleasant in any way, shape or form in that book but that's, in many ways, the world that i lived in", "i struggle with this myself -and when i say struggle with, what am i struggling with - how much to voluntarily expose myself to darkness", "because i have sort of ups and downs that i contend with and a lot of people in my family just hereditarily deal with this", "but i feel like on one hand i don't want to be pollyanna-ish", "i don't want  to just put on my rose colored glasses and believe everything is okay, everyone has everyone else's best interests in mind   because i've had friends who've been kidnapped, i've had nothing that compares to what you've experienced but i've seen enough glimpses of this brutish nastiness that on one hand i wonder as a civilian, should i not look at that stuff", "should i try to shield myself", "you know, develop a basic level of protection and skills but otherwise shield myself from it because it's not my job to have to look that in the face and in fact, it will darken my view of humanity   or should i really stare it directly in the eyes and recognize it for what it is and become acquainted with it", "and i don't know why i think about this as much as i do", "maybe because i have enough friends who have been in the military that it's sometimes a topic of conversation", "but  what are your thoughts", "i think that in order to truly experience the light and the bright, you have to see the darkness", "and i think if you shield yourself from the darkness, you'll not appreciate and fully understand the beauty of life", "again, i go back to the sacrifices that i saw guys make on the battlefield, and it's in the complete  darkness of the world, of the human soul", "you see that there's nothing brighter than somebody who lays down their life for their friends", "and so i think if you want to  understand the beauty and the glory of the life you have, it is good to know and understand that darkness", "that makes sense", "what are some of the most common misconceptions about navy seals", "or, you can pick whichever one you want to tackle; what inaccuracies bother you about seals or the military, for that matter, that are common in movies", "one of the things that i talk about when i talk to businesses, because businesses think that  if you're a military guy, if tim is a military guy and i outrank you, and i tell you to go do something, you're going to go do it with a big smile on your face and you're going to make it happen", "that's the misconception", "if  that was true, military leadership would be the easiest form of leadership in the world because everyone would just obey your commands   and it couldn't be further from the truth", "now, it would work if i outrank you and i tell you to go clean the toilet, you go, okay, you outrank  me, and you go do it", "but then you multiply the intensity there times infinite to where i'm telling you you need to go charge your machine gun nest and you're going to die if you do it; are you going to listen to me", "i wouldn't want to", "you wouldn't want to and you may or may not", "you may or may not", "i need to be a leader", "i need to actually be a leader", "if i'm going to actually get you to do stuff, i need to lead you", "i can't just order you to do it", "so that's the biggest misconception is that if we're in the military and i order you to do something, you're going to have to do it", "now again, you're not going to disobey the chain of command", "but there are many stories from seals in vietnam who have told me they got tasked with the mission to go out and do x    and they looked at the mission and said you know what, that doesn't make any sense", "i'll tell you what they'd go out and patrol 100 yards outside the wire, sit down in a little rice patty somewhere, wait two hours, come back and say yeah, the target wasn't there  or the ambush didn't happen or whatever", "they would just blatantly disobey - not blatantly\u00e9  surreptitiously", "yes, surreptitiously disobey orders", "that's one of the big challenges", "another thing i'll get is i'll meet with a ceo, and he'll say i can't wait for you to get in here and whip my people into shape", "in their mind, they're thinking if i come in and yell and scream and make people do\u00e9  drill instructor, right", "\u00e9 pushups like a drill instructor, that that will somehow create  a paradigm shift with the strategy and the culture of the companywe both can laugh at that because it's completely false", "it comes very quickly as i start to talk to them about what's happening inside their company; they realize that  what have we done from a leadership perspective is infinitely more about brains than it is about brawn", "and the brawn stuff is from the movies and it does not work in reality", "when you  mentioned the seals in vietnam sitting right outside the tripwires or whatnot, it made me think of band of brothers", "i don't know what your opinion is of that entire series but\u00e9  awesome", "i've watched it multiple times", "my mom is very fascinated by world war ii", "so letters from iwo jima and so on", "so that fascination was passed on to mehardcore history is an amazing podcast for listening to, whether it's world war i or ghengis khan or otherwise\u00e9  i completely second that.oh, it's so good", "i  tell people about it all the time", "yeah, dan carlin's amazing", "but in band of brothers, they were tasked with a raid towards the end and it's like we've already won this, and this is for some type of  - this is for someone who wants a promotion 1,000 miles away so they made the decision to kind of sit it out", "i don't know why i felt compared to share that", "i think that band of brothers, for me more than anything else that i've observed, i felt like i had a window into the pain and suffering and courage and sacrifice that was involved in a battle that is, i suppose in many ways, very, very different from the insurgent sort of counter insurgency warfare in terms of terrain   when you have a bad guy like hitler, it seems like in retrospect, everyone's on your side", "if somebody as a civilian wants to get a better  understanding of the experiences that you've had, aside from the books you recommended, are there movies or documentaries that do it justice", "restrepo, which i'm sure you've seen", "i have seen", "that's heart wrenching", "it's unbelievable", "there is an hour long, i think it's history channel, it's actually called a chance in hell; the battle for ramadi, which is about the battle for ramadi i like band of brothers", "i love the pacific", "did you see the pacific", "i've had it recommended to me multiple times", "it's the band of brothers in the pacific", "so it's absolutely phenomenal", "i had read several l of the books that the pacific is based on", "eugene sledge, i had read his book, with the old breed", "i had read a bunch of those books so i kind of knew and understood", "and that's just a phenomenal  epic story", "and got to me", "like when i was watching it, i got that feeling", "i remember there's  one scene where they're walking through the jungle in some island on the pacific, and nothing has happened yet", "and i  had that feeling, it's just like the feeling you'd have in ramadiyou'd be walking down the street", "if no shots had been fired  yet, it's this feeling of anticipation but it's fear, it's anticipation, it's the unknown and it's the waiting", "it sounds eerie", "it's the waiting for it to happen, and you know it' s coming", "and i got that feeling watching the pacific, and that was in one of the early ones", "i said wow, this is nailing it", "well done", "i have to watch that", "this is definitely the final push i need to  watch that", "what would you put on a billboard", "if you could have one billboard anywhere, what would you put on it", "one  of my kind of\u00e9 i guess my mantra is a very simple one, and that's discipline equals freedom", "i've found that as an  individual, the more disciplined you are, and it's counterintuitive; the more disciplined you are, the more freedom you actually have", "you and i both know if you wake up early, you get more done and you end up with more free time", "so the more you manage your time, the more disciplined you are with your time management, the more free time you end up having", "the more disciplined you are physically with your diet, the more freedom you have because you can do  more stuff   you have more freedom", "so the more disciplined you are, the more freedom you have", "and what's interesting is how that transfers over to both military units and the civilian sector", "when an element or  when a unit or when a company is a disciplined group, they actually end up with more freedom", "i had a seal troop", "we were highly disciplined", "we had standard operation procedures for just about everything that we did", "and you'd  think that that would restrain your creativity, but it actually doesn'tthe more disciplined you are, the easier i could say: hey, you four go take down that building   and they knew want to do because they were highly disciplined, i knew what they were going to because they were highly disciplined", "we understood what parameters they were going to stay within because we had standard operating procedures to follow", "so that discipline, both on an individual level and as a group equals freedom", "and just like anything else  with leadership, you can take that too far   you can discipline an element or a person so much that they break down and they no longer have creativity", "so just like the dichotomy of leadership, you can go too strong with discipline and they end  up breaking down, or you can give them too much freedom and they break down in the other direction.i'm really glad you mentioned that", "i've realized in a way that when i struggle the most, kind of existentially  or really just creatively, it's when i have the fewest constraints", "i want positive constraintsi need boxes, not so that i have to stay within the box but that i can start a least coloring inside the box", "that's part of the reason i've been so excited to adopt this rescue puppy, molly, because it forces me to regiment and structure my day in such a way that i can then plan around fixed  objects   i think that whether it's in the military, at least in my experience in business, you want to reserve your creativity for the things that require creativity, not for what should the steps be when i'm doing a room clearance", "it's like no, you want  a standard operating procedure so that your brain cycles are allocated to the places where you need those brain cycles", "that's 100 percent right", "so i've realized in the last few months for myself that what i thought i wanted, which is  freedom in the form of infinite options, is not actually what i want at all", "it's very stressful", "and you end up burning calories", "you burn 10 calories in a million directions, you're fatigued and you didn't get shit done", "so i'm actually, in a way, trying to figure out how i can say now to a thousand things so that i can be fully creative on one or two things   part of the reason i enjoy doing this podcast so much is that when you talk to people who have operated at the highest  levels in any field, this kind of stuff comes up", "and after awhile it's like ferriss, idiot, do you get the message yet", "you've heard meditation from 80 percent of the people who have been on your podcast", "maybe you should chill the fuck out and sit down for 20 minutes every morning", "i want to talk about ownership", "could you explain your book and why you decided to write it", "first of all, while i was still in the seal teams, once everyone knew i was getting out, i had guys saying you need to write this stuff down, you need to pass on these lessons learned", "i did that in almost a doctrinal way when i captured those lessons learned and passed those on", "and then when i started working with civilian companies, leif, my business partner, and i started hearing the same thing", "which is: hey, do you guys have a reference", "we want to  hand out some stuff to the rest of our people who couldn't make this", "and hey, you guys really changed the way this group is operating; we want to spread that to the rest of our groups", "do you have a book we can give them", "do you have reference material", "eventually we  said okay, we need to write something", "from my perspective, this is an opportunity for us to pass on the lessons that we learned and relearned some of the lessons we learned and talk about have been around for thousands of years, and some of them were discovered a little bit more recently   but they are definitely solid and they've been very well tested in a variety of environments, starting with the harshest environment of them all which is sustained, violent, urban combat", "and then we've brought them to dozens and dozens of companies and we  keep hearing the same thing, which is these work", "what's the explanation behind the title", "it actually came from an email that i sent to a manager in a company", "when i was in the seal teams and i was a troop commander, so i was in charge of tasking to bruiser and we were getting ready to go on deployment", "and occasionally the commodore, which is actually one rank above my boss is a guy named the commodore, which is a full bird colonel, if you're in the marine corps or the army", "and he's kind of in charge of all the seal teams on the west coast", "and so he would have occasional meetings where he'd bring in us, the troop commanders, the front line guys", "and this is west coast of the u.s.", "west coast of the u.s", "the story that i told in this email was that he would go around  the room, because he wants to get some direct feedback from the troops", "he'd ask somebody, what do you need", "and these guys are my peers", "someone would say well, the boots that we have are okay in the hot weather but we're getting ready to be in a cooler environment and we need new boots and we need them by this date because that's our next training block", "okay, got it", "and he'd get to the next person who'd say when we're out at the desert training facility, there's no wifi internet so our guys are disconnected and we really need to get wifi out there okay, got it", "the next guy would say we need more helicopter training support because we don't feel like we're working around helicopters enough and w really need that", "and eventually, he'd get to me", "the commodore would say: jocko, what do you need", "and i would say, we're good, sir", "i was stating the obvious, which is if i have problems, i'm going to handle them", "i'm going to take care of them and i'm not going to complain", "i took extreme ownership of my world the way that worked twofold was when i did need something, number one it was something significant, it was something real", "and when i told the commodore, hey boss, we need this right here, i would almost get it instantaneously  because he knew that i really, truly needed it   i had written and told this story and talked about extreme ownership and owning everything in your world because the other piece of that is people complain,  they place blame on other peopleand finally, if tim's boss isn't giving you the support you need, whose fault is that", "whose fault is it", "if your boss is not giving you what you need, whose fault is that", "i suppose it's my fault", "plenty of people will say it's my boss's fault", "no, it's actually your fault because you haven't educated them, you haven't influenced them, you haven't explained to them in a manner they understand why you need this support that you need", "and so that's extreme ownership; that's where the title came from", "or you've made them, as you alluded to, you've made them immune to your requests because you're the boy who cries wolf", "exactly", "if you're constantly needy, they will determine that nothing is important, or it's not a real urgent important request", "that's extreme ownership in a nutshell: you're taking responsibility for everything in your world and there's no one else  to blame", "and when we do talk about bosses, i tell this to people al the time because i always hear complaining about people's bossesand i tell people that i worked for every different type of boss you could imagine", "superb, tactical geniuses who were incredible leaders of men, and i've worked for people who didn't know anything and were horrible   and i have the same relationship with all of them", "which is i built up trust with  them so that they trusted that i was going to do the right thing, and they gave me the support i needed", "i took ownership of those relationships to make sure that was always the case", "that's another piece", "if you have a problem with your boss, it's not your boss's  fault, it's your fault", "and obviously, it's the same thing down the chain of command, as well", "what are some of the principles or lessons that the companies you've worked with have found most valuable", "cover and move is a big one", "cover and move", "cover and move", "so if you and i were going to attack a building across the street where there was an enemy, i would get in a window here and i would start shooting at them", "covering fire", "covering fire", "and you would move", "when you heard me shooting, you would start to move and you'd find a better tactical position", "and then once you got in a better tactical position, you would start shooting and i would move", "and eventually we would get to a position where we could kill the enemy and take down  the building", "so that's called cover and move", "and honestly, when i started talking to companies, i aid to myself, how do i translate an actual gun fighting tactic", "that's all it is", "it's a gun fighting contact   how do you translate that to a company, to a business", "as soon as i started talking to businesses, the first business i talked to, i realized that guess what", "every single business has multiple different elements within it", "you've got an operational group, you've got a manufacturing group, you've got a sales group", "and guess what", "all those elements have absolutely got to work together, cover and move for each other", "because if i'm the sales guy and i sell something, and you're the manufacturer, and you don't manufacture it in time or it's faulty or whatever, we fail   and if you manufacture a bunch of perfect units and i can't sell any of them, guess what", "we fail", "so that's a huge one that people really grab onto because just about every  company experiences some need to cover and move.there are so many maxims that are memorable from the military, one that i only got exposed to a few days ago and you mentioned it when we got started right here was the fact that i have two recorders", "so what is the expression", "i was trained very early on to think about single points of failure", "actually, my first job, which was mass data storage, so you  always want redundancy", "they're all about redundancy", "whether that's a ray to ray or anything else, you don't want a single point of failure", "what was the expression that you used again", "two is one and one is none", "it just means have a backup", "have a backup", "if you only have one of something, it's going to disappear", "the structure of the book, i really like and i spoke with pete about this", "could you describe it", "because it seems like every chapter has a story from combat that reflects  a principle", "then you explain the principle and then you use a business story to show how that translates", "that's exactly right", "what do you think is a part of the book that people might not pay enough  attention to that they should pay more attention to", "for instance, in the four hour chef - i'll give an example - when i'm talking about an accelerated learning frame, like [inaudible] instruction,  got it", "selection, doing the 80/20 analysis, got itsequencing: cool, got it", "stakes: setting up c consequences, they kind of gloss over it", "and i'm like no, no", "if you don't have sufficient incentives, like a punishment or reward, all that other stuff, the how-to stuff, doesn't matter", "but they gloss over it   and i take responsibility for that, like maybe i didn't highlight the importance enough", "but what are areas or chapters of the book, anything that comes to mind where you're like, you know what", "people might gloss over this or pay less attention to it than they should", "i don't know if this will answer your question but what's been interesting on the feedback we've gotten is we have different people find different chapters; they latch onto different chaptersand so there are even chapters where we said hey, maybe we should take this chapter out; i don't know about this chapter or that chapter", "and we even got some feedback saying take this chapter out, and literally would get someone saying the best chapter is the chapter that someone else told us to take outiso i think that  people are going to identify very easily what relates to them", "there will be a high point of this completely relates to me, and then there will be some others: oh yeah, i've seen that before, not as much because maybe that's a skill area that they have so they don't really need to work on that", "that's what i've found most interesting is that variety of answers when people like the different sections and they get something out of the various chapters", "that's  a really good sign, by the way", "and i know we're chatting about this book and i'm excited to see what it does in the wildwhat i've noticed for the books that i've written, which are way, way too long for any sane person to write them; reading is a different story", "because it can be like a choose your own adventure book   but what i've done proofreading and when i've had friends read, the rule that i've decided on is to remove something, you need a consensus", "to keep something, you only need one person  to love it", "so if i have one person who says i love this part, it doesn't matter if nine out of ten people say i hate it; it stays in", "that's a good rule", "so you don't need everything in a book to apply to every personit's just like if you had a commanding officer, not everything that person would say would equally apply to you if they're dealing with groups as you have dealt with groups and teams", "so that's a very promising sign there are so many questions i could ask you, i don't even know where to start", "let me take a quick glance at a few things here because i know we want to grab some  food in not too short order", "jocko hungry", "jocko hungry, jocko smash", "i don't want jocko to smash me because i would be helpless", "what do you talk to about seals more versus civilians", "obviously, you have the comradery and common background of the warfare experience", "but aside from trading those stories, what do you tend to talk to seals about more versus civilians", "straight to the point when i go and talk to seals, i spend a little more time talking about - number one, i talk about the tactics, the actual on the ground tactics of what was happening, and that's valuable lessons learned another thing that i talk about in depth is around the piece of risk mitigation", "now, as you know in the business world, risk mitigation is huge and as a matter of fact, the first time  i ever spent the day with a ceo and he said what do you think about this stuff, i said it's kind of like what i used to do: risk mitigation", "but when you're talking about your guys getting killed, it's a whole nother ballgame", "and i remember a conversation i had with my commanding officer", "so this is the type of thing i would tell seals", "we are not on deployment yet so we're still back in america and my commanding officer brings me in", "he knew  we were going to ramadi", "he knew ramadi was really bad", "and he said before you go on any operation, i want you to think about if it is worth the risk of losing one  of your guys   and i said to him, sir, i don't need to think about that", "i can tell you right now there's no operation you can task me with that i would trade one of my guys for; not going to happen", "that being said, we are going on deployment to iraq", "we have a mission and we have a job, and we have a duty to execute that mission", "and we will take risks, and we'll do everything we can to mitigate those risks", "but if we're going to take zero risks, then we might as well just stay here in san diego, california    that's the kind of thing\u00e9 people can be very risk averse, even in the military", "it can get very, very risk averse", "and it's understandable it's understandable that you say is this worth the risk or not", "and my point always was you have to just mitigate the risks as much as you can, but there are going to be risks you're going to have to deal with", "absolutely", "and in a  military context, it seems like a huge risk is not making a decision, which is a decision in and of itself", "and when i look at, say, the laird hamiltons of the world, who is an incredible big wave surfer, or i just interviewed jimmy chin, who is one of the key climbers; he's effectively a professional athlete in this documentary called marhu, which is about this shark's fin in i want to say india but it might be pakistan, this rock face that has defeated  the world's best climbers for 30 years   people view all of these people as massive risk takers, and when you actually sit down and talk to these guys, you realize they are expert risk mitigators", "i think it's very easy to come to the mistaken conclusion in business, for example, that you only win big if you bet the farm", "and in fact, when i talk to some of these companies here in silicon valley, for instance, that have  become worth billions and billions of dollars, some rightly, some maybe in the rational exuberance of our current day, but many i think rightly so   you see that in my experience, in no cases have they bet the farmthey have evaluated the downside, they've tried to measure the maximum allowable downside, they know not only their bet and their bet size but when they're going to fold they have an exit strategy for minimizing or capping losses", "and unfortunately, i think that the kind of renegade risk taker gets romanticized in a lot of different spheres including  business, and they get the magazine covers in some cases because it makes for a good story   but there is a huge survivorship bias because you don't get to see the nine out of ten who tried the same excessively ballsy move and got their balls chopped off", "they  don't make it to the magazine cover", "i'll get up and brief a bunch of missions that we did and when i get done, i'll be saying i didn't brief you guys on any missions that we didn't do", "there were plenty of missions that we looked at, we weighed the risk versus the reward and we said not worth the riskand so we do the exact, same thing", "i think you're 100 percent right", "very high-level risk mitigation is the same in business and in combat", "yeah i remember hearing an expression, i don't know who to attribute this to but it's like if you cap your downside, the upside takes care of itself", "and i'm not sure that that applies in every circumstance and it might not be a perfect guideline but it's a helpful guideline", "where it's like if you take enough shots and  you've constantly capped your downside, if you have a couple of outliers that give you disproportionate upside, in the long run you're going to average out ahead and beat most people, especially the people who are cavalier who's a historical figure that you identify with, if any", "i talked about david hackworth, and i look up to him", "by the way, he became a peace guy", "that's where he ended up, living in australia  as a premier, leading the pack on anti nuclear weaponsso he's not your average guy", "a historical figure", "that's a tough question", "i'm not sure what my answer would be", "i'll stick with hackworth.alright, hackworth it is", "what is something most people would be surprised to know about you", "again,  i think it's the same thing i talked about earlier with the fact that i have a certain look to me, you might say, that i look like kind of a serial killer combined with some kind of a psychopathic steroid mutant", "you saw my text to my girlfriend", "i was just trying to prepare her", "i think  there's some kind of surprise when people hear me string a sentence together and say okay", "so i think that's surprising to a lot of people", "it makes me think of this comedian, jim gaffigan, really  funny guy", "he's talking about how attractive people have it really easybecause he's like: and then there's a beautiful woman and she has a book, and people are like ooh, she's beautiful and she can readdouble threat", "but no, you're very good at stringing sentences together do you have any bad habit or bad habits that you're working to overcome", "bad habits", "i can rephrase: non-ideal habits", "what are you trying to improve about yourself", "i'm trying to improve everything all the timethat's a much easier question because i want to be faster, stronger, more limber, smarter, quicker, wittier, always everything always trying to improve", "so if you were to prioritize those currently, let's just say over the next 12 months, which are the areas that you're hoping to most push into overdrive or improve upon", "i  literally wake up every day and i'm trying to do all those things", "i don't know how i would prioritize them", "and the reason i think is because they're not mutually exclusive", "one of my  laws of combat is prioritize and execute", "which means if you've got multiple problems going on, if you try to handle them all at once, you will absolutely fail", "so prioritize and execute                                      you look at what problems you have, you pick the most impactful one or the biggest threat and you solve that one", "and then you move on to the next one and the next one and so forth", "i can definitely read and work out and stretch all in the same days", "these are not mutually exclusive things and  i'll do them all", "you're right, and i guess it could be viewed as a trick question", "i was reading a number of transcribed lectures by christian emeriti and he talked about - and i'm probably butchering this by paraphrasing it but the fact that people talk about changing one small thing at a time", "and i do think there's a place for that in behavioral change and it certainly applies to things like dog training, or human training    operant conditioning, and classical conditioning, and blah, blah, blah shaping and all of that", "but there are cases where the elements are so intertwined, you can't change one without changing all the others", "so you can't eat the elephant in one small bite at a time; you have to try to eat the whole fucking elephant", "alright, let me ask you a couple of cheesy questions just because i'm feeling the spirit move me, here", "you walk into a bar", "what do you order from the bartender", "water", "water", "do you not drink alcohol", "no", "you do not", "no caffeine, very limited caffeine no alcohol", "are there any other things you abstain from that would surprise people, perhaps", "i don't think so", "what type of music do you listen to when working out", "i  grew up listening to heavy metal and hardcore music, primarily black sabbath was kind of my indoctrination into that world", "good choice", "i remember one of my buddies, grown up, he was praising black sabbath", "and he said music throughout the history of the world has been meant to make people feel better and bring them joy, and black sabbath has absolutely nothing to do with that", "that darkness, again we're going back to that theme of darkness", "i think that black sabbath was the first group that i heard that i said that's what i feel, what is that", "and i  latched onto it", "from then, i started saying what's harder", "what's darker than that", "and i ended up listening to a lot of hardcore", "i'll give a shout out to black flag", "oh, yeah, black flag", "black flag, my war, side two", "which,  if you listen to black flag, and even me when i was growing up, i thought yeah, these guys are okay, whatever; no big deal, punk rock", "but you get to my war side two, and there was a paradigm shift and it was a completely new thing", "i had black flag my war side two on my record player for maybe even a year,  where that's just what i listened to", "and then again, a lot of the hardcore stuff  that i grew up listening to, i still listen to that today", "it's still on my iphone and what i plug into if i was to say some of the more modern music that i listen to, i'd throw out the white buffalo", "the white buffalo", "yeah, who is just an incredible musician", "and what's incredible about him is he writes  songs and sings songs that have impact and leave a mark", "he plays acoustic guitar and it's not heavy metal by any stretch of the imagination but it is hard and it is raw, and it is true", "one of the few concerts i've seen in the last ten y ears has been white buffalo, white buffalo, white buffalo, and white buffalo", "so i've seen him a bunch of times", "every time he comes around i go and see him", "i'll  have to check that out", "whit e buffalo, i won't even get into it but very interesting mythological or sort of traditional native american associations with the white buffalo, also", "people can google that and check it out", "you can go deep looking into the stories  associated with the white buffalo, alsojust a few more questions", "if you could give your 25-year-old self-advice, what would it be", "i'm 25 years old,  i'm at seal team one and i need to know that you don't know everything", "and right now, i know that right now, that i don't know everything and that i still have a ton to learn", "it's kind of like again we'll go back to jiu-jitsu, but i told that story earlier", "when i first learned a couple basic moves, i thought i knew jiu-jitsu", "i thought i was good", "i got it.and now, and i've been training for 20-something years and i know  that i don't know a quarter of what i need to know or a tenth of what i need to know", "and it's the same thing with everything in life", "you've got to have an open mind", "you've got to be ready to learn all the time", "and always be seeking out that knowledgebecause it doesn't just smack you", "you've got to seek it out and talk to people, and that's how you learn and get smarter", "how old are you now, if you don't mind my asking", "i'm 44", "44", "what about your 35-year-old  self", "now i'm in ramadi", "looking back now, i would say relish that moment, which i did but i would say relish that moment", "jocko, this has been fascinating and a real honor", "i appreciate you taking the time", "where can people find  more about you, about the book, about your company", "where are the best places to visit you", "and everybody listening, of course the links and so on to everything we talked about in this discussion will be at fourhourworkweek, all spelled out, fourhourworkweek.com and just click on podcast", "where can people find more about you and your work online", "we have a facebook for the book that's coming out,  extreme ownership is where you fan find that on facebook", "we have a twitter for extreme ownership, as well", "leif and i are both extremely inept at social media so we're trying to make some improvements there", "and as we get people interested, we'll do more", "i actually have a twitter account", "i think i've posted one twitter statement", "it's kind of weird    i never liked people who just talk for no reason", "and i kind of get the feeling when you're posting something on twitter, you're kind of talking for no reason", "i don't know, maybe as people start to ask me questions on twitter and now i have a conversation, because  to just sit there and talk feels awkward to me and not right", "yeah, to describe the [inaudible] you just had to perfect strangers on the internet", "i'll tell you what i'll do", "after we get off, i'll show you how i use twitter for extremely fast information gathering and polling, and i think you'll find that interesting", "i'm sure i will", "because there are some very practical applications", "so guys, i will link to all of this", "website is - i always mispronounce this", "is it echelon or eckelon", "it's actually echelon", "echelon", "e-c-h-e-l-o-n- front dot com", "i will link to all this stuff but i'll say it anyway", "follow jocks so that he's forced to interact on twitter, which is sort of the antithesis  of the act more, talk less ethos that i so respect", "but i will show him some interesting ways to implement it", "@jockowillink, so on twitter, at j-o-c-k-o w-i-l-l-i-k and extreme ownership will also be on twitter and facebook", "i'll link to all this stuff but that will be in the show notes", "and jocko, thanks so much", "i really appreciate the time", "appreciate the opportunity", "thank you", "alright, man", "we'll  get some food and to be continued", "so guys, let us know what you thought", "check out the book, you should really check out the book, extreme ownership", "i've been reading it and very highly actionable, very easy to digest   you have lessons wrapped into stories so you have some sugar coating that will help compel this and propel this into your brain so you can actually use this information", "as always, thank you for listening", "until next time, learn, experiment,  test and educate yourself."]}
