This is Tim Ferris and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferris Show where it is my job to tease out the habits, routines, tactics you can use from world-class performers of all different types, including business, military, chess, anything and everything imaginable, and there are patterns. The guest today is Frank Blake, @FrankBlake on Twitter. Frank served as chairman and CEO of the Home Depot from January, 2007 through November, 2014, and then as chairman through January of 2015. Frank joined the Home Depot in 2002 as executive vice president for business development and corporate operations. He previously served as deputy secretary for the US Department of Energy. Prior to that, he served in a variety, and I do mean wide variety, of executive roles at General Electric, and we do have some great, great stories related to lessons learned from Jack Welch, as a side note, including senior vice president, corporate business development. Under that umbrella, he did just about everything imaginable. He\u2019s an expert of mergers and acquisitions and much, much more. But, that\u2019s not it. Frank\u2019s public sector experience includes having served as general counsel for the US Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, deputy counsel to Vice President George Bush, and law clerk to Justice Stevens of the US Supreme Court. He serves on the board of directors for the Georgia Aquarium, Procter & Gamble, Macy\u2019s, and is currently serving as chairman of the Delta and Grady hospital boards. Additionally, he sits on the Board of Trustees at Agnes Scott College. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard and a jurisprudence degree from Columbia University School of Law. He is a very, very entertaining guy, has fantastic stories, and also, a lot of takeaways that you can apply. He also has a podcast, which is short form, 25 minutes, so if you wanna scratch that itch, check out crazygoodturns.org. And the description, we tell inspiring stories about people who do amazing things for others. There\u2019s some fantastic episodes so I encourage you to check that out. And, without further ado, please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation with the ever-fascinating and very, very effective, Frank Blake. Frank, welcome to the show. Frank Blake: It\u2019s great to be here, thank you. Tim Ferriss: I am so thrilled to have you here to help me solve the riddles of life. Frank Blake: Uh-oh. Tim Ferriss: And I thought I would start with maybe some common ground, and it relates to a book called Built from Scratch. So, the background, personally speaking, is that Built from Scratch, along with a few other books, have traveled with me for more than 30 years now. Frank Blake: Wow. Tim Ferriss: So, they helped set me on my first entrepreneurial journey step and have traveled from house to house, apartment to apartment, country to country ever since. And in the course of doing research, I had read that when you became the CEO of Home Depot that you had read passages from Built from Scratch, and I was curious if you recalled any of that, why you chose to do that. If you could walk us through it, that would be fantastic. Frank Blake: First, your research is great, absolutely right. That\u2019s very exciting that the book is important to you. As you\u2019ll hear, it\u2019s hugely important to me. First, the book is the story of Home Depot. It was written by Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank and about Bernie and Arthur and Ken Langone and their founding of Home Depot. It\u2019s one of the great entrepreneurial stories of our century, of our times, because Bernie and Arthur had been fired from their prior job. Ken Langone said to them when they got fired, you just got hit by a golden horseshoe in the ass. You\u2019re so lucky. And then they went and established the Home Depot, which was the most successful retail concept of its time, fastest to 10 billion, 20 billion, 30 billion, and 40 billion. My connection with the book is it\u2019s very meaningful to me, not only because it\u2019s the story of the founding of the Home Depot, but also because of my start as the CEO of Home Depot. I did not have a background that would lead anyone to think that I\u2019d ever be the CEO of the Home Depot. In fact, when the board called me and said, we want you to be the CEO, I said you ought to take a day and think about this, because while I had been at Home Depot for a few years, I had not been really doing a lot of the retail work. I\u2019d been doing M&A activity and real estate and that kind of thing, and I said, you ought to spend a day, think about it, and think about hiring a real retailer, and I need to think about it. Obviously, they called back at the end of the day, they still offered me the job. I obviously took the job, but I can honestly say that a nanosecond before the call, I was not thinking, I\u2019m going to be the CEO of this company. There were no moments of driving along in the dark of night thinking, oh, what would I do if I were running this place? I was completely unprepared. And then, like a lot of retailers, we have a way of communicating to our associates. At the time, Home Depot had around 350,000 associates. We have little TVs that we beam in messages to the break rooms, and I have to go and address the 350,000 associates being singularly unprepared. At the time, my son, Home Depot has a program of returning veterans, giving them jobs in the store. My son was a returning Iraq veteran, Iraq War veteran, had come back, had been an assistant store manager, was now a store manager at Home Depot. And so, I gave him a call and I said, Frank \u2013 he has the same name as I \u2013 I said, Frank, do you have any thoughts on what I should say? And first, he said, wow, dad, good luck. And then, the second thing he said was, I don\u2019t know what you should say but I can tell you how I start every store meeting in my store. I said, great, what do you do? And he said, I take Built from Scratch and I read from it. I\u2019ll read a passage from. And I go, this is brilliant. And so, I pick up the book, I flip madly though it to find something that I think is relevant, and in the book, they talk about the inverted pyramid and the leadership concept where the CEO is at the bottom and the customers and the front line associates are at the top. And so, I used that, reading from Built from Scratch and the inverted pyramid as my first communication to our associates. And then, for the next eight years as CEO, I spent time figuring out, what does that actually mean? How do you lead from an inverted pyramid perspective and what are the leadership lessons you pull from that? So, yes, hugely important book. It\u2019s a great book. Unfortunately, it\u2019s out of print but I\u2019m sure I can get it for anybody who wants it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, maybe we could get the publisher to do a reprint. Frank Blake: Yeah, that would be great. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll give them a heads up when this is gonna land. Frank Blake: Right. Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019d like to start right in the middle of the action, in medias res, with something like that, and then rewind the clock. So, if we go back to your childhood, could you tell us a bit about where you grew up and how you would describe your childhood? Frank Blake: I grew up right outside of Boston, Massachusetts, a family of five. I was the fourth of five. Unfortunately, my three older siblings have died. My mom, though, just had her 100th birthday and still lives in the house I grew up in. I had a great, very family-oriented experience growing up, very close family, and we have a lot of relatives in the area so New England\u2019s sort of home still. Tim Ferriss: What did your mom do for her 100th birthday? Frank Blake: So, we had a big party and we had lots of relatives, lots of her friends. She\u2019s the kind of person who, if you say, mention any name, she will know exactly what that person\u2019s father did, what their sister did. She\u2019ll have a backstory that will go on for 15 or 20 minutes. She works the phone constantly. She did that growing up and she\u2019s done that even to the age of 100. She\u2019s sharp as a tack. Tim Ferriss: Wow, so, factual recall. Frank Blake: Yeah, very, very good, and storytelling, so you just go, wow, I had no idea that there was that much interest in going on in their life, they had a twin sister and the twin sister ran away with the grocery man. It was just all that kind of detail, fascinating stuff. Tim Ferriss: What did you think you were going to grow up to be when you were in, say, high school or when you were younger? Frank Blake: I was interested in politics, so I worked on campaigns. When I got out of college, I worked in the state legislature in Massachusetts. After I went to law school, I then ended up in Washington, DC. I had a very traditional Washington, DC lawyer government career, moved back and forth from private practice and into the government, so politic fascinate me. I was interested in politics. Tim Ferriss: Why did it fascinate you? What led to that, or what about it? Frank Blake: I think you start by the issues being so interesting. You think you can impact people\u2019s lives. Power is a fascinating thing and so, politics is a source of power and it\u2019s fascinating because of it. Tim Ferriss: Did you experience conversations about politics over the dinner table or how were you introduced to it? Frank Blake: Not a bit. Tim Ferriss: Not a bit? Frank Blake: Not a bit. No, not a bit. It was entirely self-generated. I don\u2019t know where it came from, but no one else was remotely interested in politics. That was my thing. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, as I was mentioning before we start recording, I\u2019ve had a hell of a time trying to figure out what path to take with this conversation because you have such an eclectic background, and people will have heard, certainly, a fair amount of this in the introduction, but I\u2019ll just mention a few things and then I\u2019ll get to the question. So, you have law clerk for Supreme Court Justice, general counsel for GE \u2013 I\u2019m skipping a lot \u2013 deputy secretary. Now, do you say deputy secretary of the Department of Energy or is it better to just say deputy secretary of energy? Frank Blake: Department of Energy. Tim Ferriss: There we go. Alright, and then CEO of Home Depot, and then, certainly, at least as one of our mutual friends has put it, you are the least retired, retired person he knows. I have a lot of friends who are lawyers, a lot of friends who are lawyers, formal lawyers, and they tend to be very certainty-focused and averse to entrepreneurship. So, how have you, and if this is even accurate, ended up with this combination of very strong legal background and ability to manage amidst uncertainty, and combine those two? It\u2019s really unusual, from my experience, at least. Frank Blake: Probably an awful lot accidental, so the first part accidental was a group of us set up our own law firm. So, there were 12 of us who set up our own law firm and that was kind of my first experience with entrepreneurial activity. The firm did great. Most of my instincts, actually, looking back, are pretty funny because I was wrong. So, that was an introduction to entrepreneurial activity. I left Washington to go to GE to be the general counsel of a business in Schenectady, New York, and everybody thought, that\u2019s the stupidest thing we\u2019ve ever heard. Why would you leave Washington, a great legal practice, and go to Schenectady? And mostly, by that time, I was kind of sick of politics and sick of Washington. And I was the beneficiary of the way GE did HR. Basically, they move people around every 18 months, but they never bothered to move the lawyers because they\u2019re not going to bother to move the lawyers. So, after about five or six years, I\u2019m the person around the table who sort of knows how the business works and I\u2019ve listened to this and I\u2019ve observed over time, and they offered me a job going onto the business side and then the rest of it. Being a lawyer is great, having been a lawyer is even better, so I really enjoyed the business side this out so I really I really enjoyed the business side and found in much, much more fascinating than the legal side. Tim Ferriss: How did you make the decision? Walk us through making the decision to leave the law practice and take the job at GE, because that could be a scary step. And I know, certainly, looking around myself at my friends who have what most people would consider successful legal careers, they often pine after these types of changes but very few of them actually take the leap. So, how did you make that decision? Frank Blake: There were two things. The first, just as a scene-setter, it is the case, I have never made, as a salary, more money than I made as a lawyer, so I did more with my draw from the law firm than through to being CEO of the Home Depot. So, it was a very good legal practice. The problem with legal practice, after a while, that you realize is there\u2019s such a disincentive for any kind of efficiency, right? Somebody comes in with a problem and you go, I know this problem, I can name this tune in three notes. Well, no. Actually, that\u2019s not the business model. You wanna say, oh, boy, that\u2019s a complex symphony. That\u2019s gonna be 3,000 notes. And so, the idea of trying to do something that\u2019s cumulative, rather than billing your time by the hour, is really what appealed to me. And Washington is a very-closed little culture, and I wanted just get out of that closed culture. And Schenectady, New York sounded like the far end of the earth. Tim Ferriss: Now, at the time, were you single, married? Frank Blake: Married. Tim Ferriss: You were married? Frank Blake: Married. Tim Ferriss: How did you deliver the news or how did you discuss the possibility of that switch, if you\u2019re comfortable saying? Frank Blake: Yeah, I don\u2019t know that we had a lot of discussion around it, but it was clear that I was not. I just was becoming increasingly unhappy on the legal side. Well, I\u2019m not sure everybody was thrilled. My family wasn\u2019t thrilled to be moving. We lived in Albany, but to be moving to Upstate New York, they rode in with it. Tim Ferriss: It gets chilly. I grew up in New York but on Long Island, but Upstate gets chilly for people who haven\u2019t been there. Frank Blake: Upstate is chilly. Yeah, it\u2019s very chilly. Tim Ferriss: GE is another company in addition to Home Depot. Even though I\u2019ve never done anything myself in any industries related to either, that is fascinating to me. Frank Blake: Yes. Tim Ferriss: When did you first meet Jack Welch? Frank Blake: Oh, early on, and then I ended up as a direct report for Jack. The founders of Home Depot, Bernie Marcus, Ken Langone, Arthur Blank, they\u2019re extraordinary people. Jack Welch is an extraordinary human being. One of the ways I would describe it is I would never take a phone call from him sitting down. The energy, just immediately, you stood up to provide an answer to Jack. He was hugely helpful to me while I was the CEO at Home Depot, got a lot of stories around Jack, truly a hero. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let\u2019s get into it. This is a long form podcast, so we have the luxury of time. Frank Blake: Alright, so this is an arc. So, I become CEO of the Home Depot. I think, alright, now I\u2019m gonna call Jack and I\u2019m gonna ask him for some time and kind of give me CEO one-on-one lessons, which I did and he was very nice. He was down in Florida at the time and I said, Jack, can I spend a day with you and kind of pick your brains? He said, great. And, mind you, I have done hundreds of pitches to Jack in my time at GE, and I prepared so hard for this meeting with him. I could tell you the margin rate of an ant trap. I mean, I was just into all the details, all the numbers, and I go down and the first thing he says is draw me your org hart. And we spend the day going through people and it was probably one of the most helpful days of my time. And I recommend this for anybody, anywhere. If you find somebody that you really respect who\u2019ll ask you questions and then you just listen to what you\u2019re saying, and in effect, he did that for me on the organization and the people. And then, every year, I do the same thing. I\u2019d spend a day with Jack every single year. And this is jumping ahead but I love the story so much. Tim Ferriss: We can jump around. Frank Blake: So, the eighth year, so my last time, I get to ask the question that\u2019s sort of the moron, stupid question that you wouldn\u2019t dare ask earlier because you wouldn\u2019t be able to get the next meeting with Jack. So, I go, okay, Jack, all of the attributes of leadership, if you had to weigh them all and pick one, what is the single most important attribute of leadership? And his answer shocked me. He said generosity, and I wouldn\u2019t have predicted it. It kind of took me by surprise when he said it, and then when he explained it and explained how, as leaders, you need to be fueled by the success of others and how that\u2019s really got to be the driving force. And I could see that as true for how he ran GE. It made a lot of sense and it stuck with me ever since. It was a great lesson. Tim Ferriss: Why was it important in that first meeting that he shifted the focus to the org chart? What happened? What were the questions he asked? What were the important? Frank Blake: So, the great questions were, first, how are you organized? Because that tells a lot about what your priorities are. And second, he\u2019d be asking about people and I\u2019d find myself, in some instances, kind of making excuses and saying, well, you know, blah-blah-blah, but not really, and then he\u2019d just say, I mean, did you hear what you just said? What are you gonna do about it? And it wasn\u2019t his commentary on these people, he didn\u2019t even know them, but listening to his feeding back to me what I was saying and then say, hey, look, you\u2019re not smart enough to do this on your own, so if you\u2019re gonna do this and be successful, you gotta get the right team with you. Tim Ferriss: For people who don\u2019t know Jack, what would you say he\u2019s best known for? I mean, something that\u2019s stuck with me, and I have great respect for Jack and I\u2019ve read a lot about him, but I might be getting the details wrong because it\u2019s been a while, I mean, he\u2019s had the nickname Neutron Jack. I think it was the bottom ten percent of performers in GE were let go on an annual basis. Frank Blake: Yeah, annual basis. Tim Ferriss: And was he then asking you about strongest, weakest performers and then asking you why you were keeping or why the weakest performers were continuing to be employed? Frank Blake: So, he wasn\u2019t doing it on a kind of percentage, tell me who lags and who\u2019s ahead. It was more individual by individual, tell me, describe for me their strengths and weaknesses, go through it. And what I would say, what Jack did particularly impresses me in retrospect because it\u2019s so hard to do. I go into GE as a lawyer, GE is a finance engineering firm. We had a great legal team, but still, the lawyers are not at the top of organizational pecking order. Somehow, Jack got the sense within me that the path to success in the company was actually to disagree with him and be right, and that\u2019s huge. And he would say this. I\u2019d express, wow, in retrospect, Jack, that\u2019s so amazing, and he\u2019d say, well, I really don\u2019t need to pay people to tell me I\u2019m right. I need to pay people who are going to tell me where I\u2019m wrong. But, organizations are such echo chambers and Bernie Marcus gave me a great piece of advice. He gave me tons of pieces of advice that were terrific. I remember one of them at the start of becoming CEO. Bernie said, okay, let me tell you how this works. You\u2019re gonna be sitting around a table and you\u2019re going to tell a joke, and all the folks are gonna laugh. And he said, let me tell you, you\u2019re not funny. And the point of that is, people are just gonna respond to you the way they think you want them to respond, so eliciting the kind of reaction that Jack did for me, which was, hey, it\u2019s okay, actually, to disagree with the boss. You damn well better be right, but it\u2019s a good thing. To disagree with the boss is huge. Tim Ferriss: So, on that point, and I may get the pronunciation wrong, Carol Tom\u00e9? Frank Blake: Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0At the time, Home Depot\u2019s CFO, she said that when you arrived, still, and this is a compliment, that you invited conflict into the decision-making process. And I\u2019ll quote here. This is from a Fortune article. We were conflict-hesitant. Frank asked a ton of questions that make you say what is working and not working. So, this is interesting to me. How do you encourage people to disagree and elicit the bad news or whatever it might be? How do you do that without also simultaneously or dissipating the fear of getting punished for that? Frank Blake: I think it\u2019s one of the most important things. So, I have a long discussion around what the inverted pyramid means, but one of the things it means is that everything that\u2019s important, as the CEO, everything that\u2019s important is happening above you with the customers and the front line associates, and the folks who work in the organization, so you\u2019ve got to figure out a way to effectively listen and effectively get them to communicate to you. I learned, actually, from a board member at Home Depot, this may be more unique to retail to doing this but it worked, that the best way to do that is if I was walking in a store and we had a particular project, my comment would be why isn\u2019t Project X working? And then they\u2019d go, oh, my gosh. Frank knows that the project isn\u2019t working. I guess we better say something. And so, that would actually prompt a conversation. While, if you said, how\u2019s everything going, in any organization of any size, there\u2019s only one right answer when the boss says, how\u2019s everything going? The answer is, it\u2019s going great, you\u2019re awesome, please go. And you need to pullout from people. Every once in a while, somebody would say, why\u2019d you say it\u2019s not working? It\u2019s working great. But, more often than not, it would be, oh, well, here\u2019s what\u2019s not happening, here are the issues. Tim Ferriss: So, there are so many pieces of paper, as you can see, and so many questions that I want to ask, and the next one is really closely related to this and something that I think about a lot and I\u2019ll lead into it in a somewhat confusing way. The internet is almost all negative feedback. People get punished and attacked. However, if you look at, say, operant classical conditioning, mammal training, and human training, positive reinforcement is actually critically important. So, this is a quote and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019d love to get some examples of how you have celebrated people\u2019s successes and wins, whether within Home Depot of elsewhere. And the quote is, I\u2019m a lawyer, lawyers don\u2019t celebrate shit. OR actually, furthermore, the only way people know what you want is that you celebrate when they get it right. I\u2019m a lawyer, lawyers don\u2019t celebrate shit. So, what are concrete examples of how you would do that? Frank Blake: That was actually one of my biggest learnings of the time as CEO, was the importance of celebration. In fact, what I tell people now is every business person knows the saying that you get what you measure. I\u2019d say there\u2019s an important, maybe even more important, corollary, you get what you celebrate. People, just as you say, they reference off of the stories. They reference off of when you reward someone and make a point of it. That actually sticks in the mind long after other things are forgotten. And at Depot, we did a lot, in fact, spent a lot of time on this. Personally, I would spend every Sunday afternoon writing notes to hourly associates, so, for us, customer service was what we were after. Customer service is such a vague term, and I would write 100 to 200 notes every Sunday. And we had a whole process for rolling up the Joan, Jane, Jack did blank, and it would roll up from the store to the district to the region, and I would write notes saying dear Joe or Jane. And it wouldn\u2019t just be, you\u2019re awesome, thank you very much, Frank. It would be, I heard you did, blank, and I\u2019d write out what it was, thank you very much, and send the note out, sign my name. I have a long thing about note writing and why note-writing is so important. Tim Ferriss: Well, let\u2019s get into it, yeah. Frank Blake: Okay. So, I wondered about the power of that, but early on, I was walking a store and an associate came up to me and said, gee, would you rewriting the note that you sent me? And I said, no, sure, no problem, but why? And he said, well, we were all convinced that it was a robo-pen note, and so we put it under water and it leaked, it ran, and so, would you write me another one? People respond to being recognized. I learned this. Early in my career, I worked for George Bush\u2019s dad when he was Vice President. And so, great thing to work. I mean, he\u2019s a wonderful human being. Working for the vice president is great because it\u2019s a very small staff so you can actually see what he does. At the time, this is 1981, ages and ages ago, no computers, but he would come into the office and type out notes. And you knew that he was typing the notes because the E would be slightly off and there\u2019d be White Out. But, as a staff member, when you go a note from the vice president, you were walking on water. I mean, you just felt like everything was great. And I believe that we learn more from those positive stories and recognition than anything else. In addition, I mean, the notes were kind of my thing, but we also did a video every single week of great customer service, and we put it in that same break room TV. Tim Ferriss: And you\u2019d video tape the actual associates who were being highlighted? Frank Blake: Yeah, we\u2019d retell the story. We\u2019d retell the story with the associates. So, there\u2019s be one of these every single week. We did little books of great associate customer service stories. If you go into storage, you\u2019ll see people with badges and recognition. You just don\u2019t communicate. You can write a memo to someone and think it gets down through an organization but it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s when you pull people out and say, here, this is what this person did that was extraordinary, you tell a story it, and everyone remembers that story. That person\u2019s thrilled and everybody else is going, I want a story told about me, too, I\u2019m doing that kind of stuff as well, and it builds on itself. Tim Ferriss: I think the number that you mentioned was 350,000 or a few hundred thousand. Frank Blake: Right. No, 350,000, and now they\u2019re over 400,000. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, if you have 350,000 associates and you\u2019re doing this every week, what are the check boxes or the process for selecting those 200? I\u2019d love to learn more about that. No doubt, there are people listening to this, I know there are people listening to this, who run very large organizations and that\u2019s gonna be one of the questions top-of-mind, I would imagine. Frank Blake: So, the great thing about it is you take that, so you say, Frank wants to send a note out, then this is where having a new great because then you say, okay, here\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna do it; the stores are going to submit stories of great customer service and the store will submit that to the district, and the district will take its best stories, and the district\u2019s best stories go to the regions, and then the regions all submit them to me. So, beyond the note writing itself, there\u2019s actually a process for recognition, so, I hope, the better store managers were recognizing every single story that they forwarded on to the district and we\u2019re making a celebration with their associates in that store, same with the districts and same with the regions so that it reinforced itself. So, it\u2019s not just the one note. It\u2019s the entire process. It is why, as I say, people just should spend time thinking about what they\u2019re recognizing and celebrating, they should do it intentionally, they should have a process around it, they should do it consistently, because we talked a lot about company culture, but that\u2019s what really sets the culture. It\u2019s what everybody is saying. You want to see the story? You wanna see what this looks like? This is what it looks like. Tim Ferriss: If these letters are going out and people want to receive a letter, they want to be in the video, what were the criteria for good stories? In other words, these various, say, district managers and so on could have their subjective views of what makes a good customer service story, but did you give them any guidelines at all? Frank Blake: I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d be honest. I mean, that\u2019s the important thing about customer service, is it takes lots of different forms, but what we weren\u2019t looking for, and it\u2019s not like this isn\u2019t important, but we weren\u2019t looking for the cashier who stopped the robber. Those are important stories but some companies are more focused on shrink prevention and things like that. We were focused on customer service, and we had lots of different, I mean, just emotionally powerful people helping other people in the store, phenomenal, phenomenally strong stories. But no, didn\u2019t set and guidelines. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned stopping a theft not being a very good example, and what this brings to mind for me is, I think it was Andy Grove of Intel, I might be getting this wrong, I\u2019m sure someone on the internet will correct me if I am, but for every metric they decided to measure which was a positive indicator for the company, Andy would insist that they would identify the perverse incentive or correlating metric that they should measure for side effects. I\u2019m reaching a little bit here but you could see if someone says, of course this is exaggerated but, oh, my god, I could get in the video if I stop a robbery. Who could I hire to simulate a robbery? And I\u2019ll let my buddy go but I\u2019ll put up a good fight and get in the video. You mentioned what you celebrate. I\u2019m sorry, let me get this right. I just wrote it down. Effectively, you get what you measure, you get what you celebrate. Frank Blake: Right. Tim Ferriss: When you took the reins, what were some of the metrics that you focused on or that the organization focused on? Frank Blake: Yeah, so, every retailer, I mean, now, it\u2019s commonplace, but you\u2019d look at what\u2019s called a net promoter score. If that\u2019s an accurate Andy Grove quote, I entirely agree with it. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s definitely a quote from someone. Frank Blake: Definitely a quote from someone and a right quote, because every single metric does have a germ of a problem in it, so you have to be careful. I mean, we would measure net promoter score, how happy the customers are in the store, but it\u2019s always a reminder that the dominant measure is, how are we doing on sales and profitability? So, as you move down below that on the metric side, you have to be very careful. Tim Ferriss: And how do you measure sales? There are many different ways to doing it, a revenue. You have revenue per square foot. You have, say, profit of revenue or net income, whatever it might be per employee. You have many different approaches you could take. Were there any that were more important than others? Frank Blake: No. Our stores, while they\u2019re very idiosyncratic within the box, they\u2019re very similar. So, we didn\u2019t have to get very sophisticated on the store side on revenue per square foot. The merchandising side, you do more of that because you\u2019d wanna say, what\u2019s our return on the space we\u2019re allocating to that merchandise? Tim Ferriss: You\u2019d mentioned at least once, maybe a few times, how you seem to be the accidental CEO, didn\u2019t expect to be asked to be CEO. How did they explain it? Or if they didn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure they probably said something. Why were you asked to be CEO? Frank Blake: Well, in the end, you need to ask Ken Langone who was the lead director and the other directors of Home Depot at the time. I\u2019ve never really spent time asking them why. I think they had seen a lot of me because I was in charge of deals, and we did a lot of M&A transactions. Tim Ferriss: That was as the SVP, the senior vice president of corporate business development? Oh, no, that was at GE. Frank Blake: Well, I did deals. So, the job I ended up with at GE was doing M&A. The job I was doing at Home Depot was doing M&A. We went out and we bought a whole series of companies called, at the time, Home Depot Supply that was the largest commercial industrial distributor in the country. But, I pitched those deals to the board so they saw me a lot, and then the first thing I did when I became CEO is that we need to sell this business and we sold the business. Tim Ferriss: Why did you have to sell the business, or why did you recommend that they sell the business? Frank Blake: The dominant reason for me, personally, and I think that this was organizationally right but I know it was right for me, individually, was saying, to be the best retailer in any space requires 110 percent of the effort. For me to be the best leader of a retailer is 110 percent-plus of effort, no chance that I can also say, oh, and here\u2019s this other business, this great commercial industrial distribution business, I can be the best CEO in that space, too, just knew that was not gonna be possible. And so, I said we need to sell it. Tim Ferriss: Is that what you said to convince the board that it was a good idea? Frank Blake: Pretty much. I don\u2019t think I made it that personal, because the company, we\u2019d been losing market share, we were trailing our principle competitor. I said, we got to be all eyes on the retail business and we gotta get rid of everything that\u2019s a distraction to retail business. Plus, at the time, so I took over right at the start of 2007 and housing crisis, by that point, the clouds were fairly obvious, and so, we knew that we had to make some dramatic changes because things were gonna go downhill fast. And they went even more downhill and faster than we anticipated. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I bought a house in late 2007. Talk about good timing. Frank Blake: Yeah, there you go. Tim Ferriss: In San Jose, AKA Man Jose, California, but that\u2019s a separate story. The decision to divest of HD Supply, and I may be misattributing so please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it also makes me think of Jack Welch if I\u2019m getting this right, which is, did he not want every division or product line or company to be an either No. 1 or No. 2 in its category? Frank Blake: He famously had that as an objective. That did not drive that decision because Home Depot Supply was No. 1. Tim Ferriss: Right, got it. So, it\u2019s more a matter of focus? Frank Blake: So, it was a matter of focus. There are some unique individuals like Jack who can run a conglomerate, and I would be deep into the details of the business I worked at in GE and Jack would still ask questions to me that I\u2019d just slap my head and go, oh, my god, what a great question. Why didn\u2019t I think of that? I knew, not me. As I said, running a conglomerate is a big, big challenge and I knew I couldn\u2019t do it. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ve talked a bit about your legal background and someone compared you at one point to Darwin Smith, the attorney turned CEO at Kimberly-Clark because of how lawyers are trained in conflict how to navigate deep rooted issues, etcetera. I\u2019ve also noticed that, for instance, if I can\u2019t find a proofreader who is a professional writer, I will ask one of my friends who is a lawyer because they\u2019re very good. They\u2019re not professional proofreaders, per se, for the type of writing that I do, but they\u2019re very good at spotting language that is nebulous, words that shouldn\u2019t be there. How did your legal training help you for what came later? And it might be a chicken and the egg thing. It could be what helped you to be a good lawyer, but what about those life experiences or that training helped you later, or hurt? Frank Blake: The hurt is easier. Tim Ferriss: We can start there. Frank Blake: Yeah, so, the things that I had to kind of had to hike away from are, for lawyers, everything is gray, right, and you can chew over decisions for a long time and it\u2019s very complex and full of ambiguity. If you\u2019re leading 350,000 people strong and you\u2019re calling out and your statements are in paragraphs, you\u2019ve lost it right from the start. So, driving for simple, portable messages, screw the ambiguity. That is essential. I actually think it\u2019s essential regardless of whether it\u2019s 350,000 people or three people. That, you kind of have to train away from. The part that\u2019s probably good is you\u2019re trained to worry. Lawyers are trained. I always felt like law school trains you to worry about things that no normal human being would worry about, and so, there is a value as a CEO to worry, but you gotta kind of internalize that as much as possible because the other part, you have to get rid of that worry. Colin Powell has a great expression that I deeply believe in, which is optimism is a force multiplier, and in any organization, and this was particularly true, his things were grim, you\u2019ve gotta drive to the optimistic side. You can\u2019t be going, oh, god, this really could turn out badly. But, I think, internally, that\u2019s helpful, to worry, to be thinking around the corner, to be thinking what\u2019s gonna go wrong. Just as you said, get that every metric that you put in place comes with its own little seed of destruction, understanding that, being aware of it, don\u2019t tell it to anybody else, so all our stores would net promoter scores. I wouldn\u2019t tell them, oh, here\u2019s the fascinating flaw in that metric, why you might not want to be committed to that, we\u2019d just go, this is what we\u2019re focused on. We\u2019re focused on our net promoters. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m gonna zoom out but I wanna zoom in for a second just on net promoter score. How did you all measure that? Frank Blake: It was by surveys on the receipt in the store, and so, you can immediately imagine, not to get into the nitty gritty what\u2019s wrong with net promoter scores. Tim Ferriss: No, let\u2019s get into it. Frank Blake: But, you can imagine, one of the things is the more crowded your store is, the more volume your store does, by and large, that correlated to a net promoter score that was a little bit lower. If you wanted the highest net promoter score, have a store that very few people went to. Tim Ferriss: Right, one customer per employee per day. Frank Blake: Right, exactly, and they were thrilled, and they\u2019d give you the positive feedback. But yeah, we did it straight off of receipts and people typing in and saying whether they were happy or they weren\u2019t happy. And then, now, on the internet, obviously, it\u2019s a lot easier. ForeSee surveys come up all the time. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s also a lot easier to, as you noted, get lost in the seeds of destruction or the noise, right, because if you have a net promoter score also, at least of some types, you can a selection bias for people who are unhappy, which is super tough, right? Frank Blake: Yep, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Zooming out, I want to do right now and look at what you said about keeping a lot of that worry and potential downside inside. This is a huge challenge for a lot of founders and CEOs that I know where they have to really put on the brave face and help everyone march to optimism while keeping any of the concerns they might have inside, or at least not showing it publicly to all the troops. Could you walk us through, if possible, or just describe maybe a period or an instance where you had a lot of that to keep inside and how you dealt with that, because a lot of these CEOs feel really alone. They end up, in some cases, getting health problems. It\u2019s very, very challenging. Could you give us, maybe, an example of how you\u2019ve contended with that? Frank Blake: The best thing for me, there\u2019s a great saying in retail that now has to be amended because of the internet, but the saying in retail is, all truth is on the floor of the store, so now it\u2019s also online but all truth is on the floor of the store. The best vehicle for me to deal with those worries was always spending time in the store, and I would try, I didn\u2019t do it religiously every week, but I would do dinners with hourly associates. Wherever I was, I\u2019d try to do one a week with hourly associates, and you pretty quickly get your problems put in perspective and it was hugely valuable to me. And I remember the first one I did was we fly in and I\u2019m sitting around. There\u2019s this very nice woman sitting next to me, give or take my age, and I\u2019m complaining about my back, so she says, how you doing, and I say something with my back. Mind you, I\u2019d flown in on a private plane and I\u2019m saying I got my back problems. And then, I go, how are you? And she said, well, you know, it\u2019s funny that you say that about your back problem because three months ago, I fractured my spine and I had to be in traction. And it was really difficult when I started working in the store again and I was in a wheelchair. We have bulky items and they have to get moved. I\u2019m complaining. And I go, wow, that\u2019s amazing, and then she said, well, that wasn\u2019t the really hard part. The really hard part was I have a 12-year-old developmentally disabled son, and I have to pay them every day and I have to get him in the bath and that was so difficult when I was in the wheelchair. The fears and worries kind of melt when you see what people are putting up with every day and doing one foot in front of the other, and having a smile and being committed to the people around them. And so, that gave a sense of perspective that sort of put the earnings per share worries a little in farther focus, and they were always great for that, just amazing. Home Depot and both Bernie and Ken, Arthur as well, the great stories of Home Depot. Now, why Built from Scratch is such a great book, why it\u2019s such a great idea \u2013 Tim Ferriss: There are some crazy stories in that book. They\u2019re great. Frank Blake: But, the underlying thing is people who typically start, I come in and I\u2019m shagging carts in the lot, maybe I graduated from high school, I\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m doing this job, and 80 percent of our store managers started as hourly associates, our upper management started as hourly associates, and it\u2019s these amazing career stories, wealth generation through starting at the bottom in retail. I was at dinner last week with a friend. This, I think, happens all the time with Bernie and Ken and Arthur, but if you go, boy, there\u2019s a bell to ring in life, this guy comes up and he\u2019s with his daughter, and he said, I just wanted to introduce my daughter to you because I want to introduce her to the person who\u2019s making her college possible. And you go, first off, obviously not me, but wow. That is such an awesome story, and that story is replicated over and over and over at Home Depot. Bernie and Ken and Arthur always talk about you have your mission statement and all the rest, but what it\u2019s really about is wealth generation for your associates. And it ties back to Jack\u2019s comment about leadership. At the end, you could say, wow, these people made their lives and careers from it. That provides a great perspective on the job. Tim Ferriss: After leaving Home Depot, since that time, how have you created a pressure release valve for the worrying or stress in your life? Frank Blake: The first great thing about retirement is the anxiety level drops dramatically. Tim Ferriss: Fewer inputs, yeah. Frank Blake: Every day, the thing about a retail businesses is, on your phone, there are your sales, and the IT organization is saying, gee, I can give you this by the minute. And you go, no, I really don\u2019t want it. Tim Ferriss: Excuse me. Frank Blake: I don\u2019t want it by the minute. So, that anxiety of every day, Home Depot just reported its results and they\u2019re great results, and Craig Menear is the CEO now. He\u2019s doing a phenomenal job, but it is that every day, every day, pressure on delivery that\u2019s good to step away from and good to think about, what are some of the other things you wanna do in your life and focus some time elsewhere. Tim Ferriss: When it creeps in, is there anything that you like to do, any particular sports or morning routines or anything that you find helpful for managing your state? Frank Blake: There are a lots of things. Tim Ferriss: Because I think your retirement is busier than most people\u2019s careers, in some respects. You certainly keep yourself occupied, so I\u2019d be curious to hear what routines [inaudible] to you. Frank Blake: The habits are very different now. Pretty much because of starting without a preset set of notions of what I was going to do at home depot, if you asked me what I did at the start of every day as CEO of Home Depot, no, the compare and contrast \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, let\u2019s do both, if you\u2019re okay with that. Frank Blake: I\u2019m not recommending this. This is not a good tool but I started every day reading emails from customers, and I did that because in any large organization, it\u2019s really easy to get a false sense from averages and percentages, and then you see, wow, we did that badly and it was a good marker, for me, of how we were doing and what we needed to focus on, and that kind of management by anecdote is actually pretty powerful. But, I would do that for an hour early in the morning. I have always gotten up really, really early. Tim Ferriss: What time is early? Frank Blake: So, I get up about a quarter to 5:00 and I\u2019d usually be in the office by 6:00 and start reading emails. Now, I don\u2019t. I still get up really early. Now, instead, I start by reading. This was a habit introduced and I struggle with the notion of an intentional god. My wife does not. My wife is a strong believer in an intentional god and we pray in the morning together, and it was awkward. I\u2019m a New Englander. Gosh, we don\u2019t do anything with anyone at that level of intimacy, and that\u2019s actually really an interesting habit to have, because saying things aloud and hearing things in her mind, and then sort of being forced in yourself, okay, what am I grateful for, what am I seeking help for, is really valuable. So, that\u2019s a different kind of habit. Tim Ferriss: What is the format? You don\u2019t have to share the specifics, unless you\u2019re open to doing that, but what is the format of the prayer? How long does it last and you mentioned maybe some sneak peaks, but I\u2019d love to hear about that because I journal almost every morning and I\u2019m not speaking aloud but there might be some commonalities. Frank Blake: Yeah. No, I suspect. Tim Ferriss: What is the format that you use? Frank Blake: And so, the format is, there\u2019s a lectionary that tells you what reading, so there are a series of readings. So, you do a reading, typically from the Old Testament, the Psalms and the New Testament is typically how you go. So, we read, and then we pray. And my prayers, I\u2019ve gotten better at it because I do think, to the extent you write it down or you say things, it kind of gives context and maybe, in some way, it makes it more likely to happen. My prayers have tended to be, hey, I hope everything works out and, boy, am I grateful for everything. My wife would be very specific, and is very specific, about this person need help, this is what I\u2019m gonna do to try to help this person. My wife, parenthetically, worked for Habitat for Humanity. That was her job and she goes to Haiti nearly every month. For a while, she was going almost every other week. So, she does a lot for other people, but she will mention, here are the people who are in need. And so, it\u2019s really helpful seeing, okay, that\u2019s what she\u2019s focused on and then it teases out for me, what should I be focused on, who needs help, what should I be doing? Tim Ferriss: So, if someone were transcribing your prayers, would there be certain categories that tend to pop up more than others, like somebody who needs help and how I\u2019m gonna help them, grateful for X? Frank Blake: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: I need help with X, are there particular buckets that tend to pop up a lot? Frank Blake: It\u2019s other people who need help. There\u2019s a separate thing of each time, kind of naming two things we\u2019re grateful for and what are we grateful for, and it could be, I\u2019m grateful to be on Tim Ferris\u2019 podcast. It\u2019s a good mental exercise to say, hey, there is an enormous amount of stuff to be grateful for and then there are people who need help. My wife is a much more powerful prayer than I am, but I\u2019m learning. I\u2019m getting there. Tim Ferriss: I really like that. I don\u2019t pray in the morning, although maybe someone would consider what I do a secular prayer, perhaps, but I do have a gratitude journal and I note the three things that I\u2019m grateful for first thing in the morning, and then I have a handful of prompts that take four to five minutes in the am and then I do a review in the pm, including what am I grateful for that happened today, effectively. It\u2019s very deceptively powerful. Frank Blake: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And, like you mentioned or maybe I\u2019m implying or inferring, it also helps to develop the lens through which you view the rest of the day. If you buy a car and then all of the sudden you go out and you see your car everywhere, it\u2019s not because everyone went out and copied you and bought your car. It\u2019s because you have that attune, selective attention. It\u2019s really powerful. Frank Blake: And it\u2019s a powerful way to get to learn about another person, too, so to get that sense of, oh okay, this is what they\u2019re worried about, this is how they think. It\u2019s really useful. Tim Ferriss: I really love that it starts with somebody else who needs help and then grateful for in the sense that it\u2019s not right off the bat beginning with your ask. That\u2019s really important. You mentioned checking or reading customer email, so I had read on, I think it was consumerist.com, it\u2019s probably elsewhere, but you gave out your phone number and email. This is the line that I found on Consumerist, use it if you have a persistent problem with Home Depot that hasn\u2019t been resolved through normal customer service channels. Remember to be polite, professional, and to the point. And then, there\u2019s a phone number extension dah, dah, dah, and you can also email Frank_Blake@HomeDepot.com. How on earth do you triage that? Did you get fewer email than expected, fewer phone calls? Did you get deluged? What happens? Frank Blake: A lot. Yeah, a lot. There are a lot. There\u2019s a lot and we have a team. I mean, I think it was hugely important to do. I did it early on. I still get customer emails, but we set up an executive resolutions team. I learned the first weekend on the job when I mistakenly answered my phone not thinking and got a customer that take a long time to get resolved. So, we have a professional team that goes through those and resolves them, but, for me, what was useful was you see patterns and you go, okay, this is what\u2019s not going well and this is consistent. It may not be numerically, percentage-wise, that high, but if somebody is taking time out of their day to email the CEO saying this is screwed up, it\u2019s worth listening to. And then, associates also knew my email and they\u2019d send me, hey, this isn\u2019t going well, you gotta fix this, you gotta fix that, whatever. Tim Ferriss: What are some of your favorite interactions, or better put, lessons learned, tidbits of wisdom received from Bernie Marcus. You said you\u2019d learned a lot. Frank Blake: Wow, a lot. Tim Ferriss: Are there any that come to mind? It could be anything where you\u2019re like, wow, that\u2019s really useful. Frank Blake: The first is, just as I said about avoiding the echo chamber, getting outside of the echo chamber. I think one of the things that makes Home Depot such a strong culture is that one of Bernie\u2019s other early on comments to me was, look, you have a prominent job, but you don\u2019t have a significant job. You have a prominent job because you go out and talk to analysts and all the rest of it, but the only significant jobs are the jobs of the people who are helping customers. And so, everything you do, and that, again, it goes back to the inverted pyramid, everything you do is in support of your front line associates and your customers and that\u2019s how you have to think about the orientation of your business. The, quote unquote, headquarters in Home Depot is not called the headquarters, it\u2019s called the store support center. That\u2019s not that unusual in retail. The idea is you\u2019re there to support the store. That\u2019s what you\u2019re there to do. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the other ingredients, those could be preexisting, so before you arrived, or changes that you and your team helped to make that help foster the orange apron cult, that sort of dedication to customer service, because it seems, at least based on what I\u2019d read, that you really paid a lot of attention to, I\u2019m not gonna say resurrecting it, but really reinforcing that as a core differentiator. Frank Blake: And, again, this is another Bernie-ism, but you need to take care of your associates and so, even when things were really tough in the housing downturn, we were giving our hourly associates pay raises and bonuses when we weren\u2019t in the store support center. Our assistant store managers get stock grants, which I don\u2019t think any other retailer anywhere near Home Depot\u2019s size, and now those stock grants, those are worth a lot of money. So, getting them bought into and understanding that the success of the company is their success, as well. Also, on pay, we instituted a very strong success sharing program, so if your store does well, the associates get an extra bonus. All of those things to say, look, I can\u2019t expect an associate to care about paying attention to the customer if the company isn\u2019t caring about the associate. We did lots of other programs and then a lot on the recognition and reward side to reinforce the culture of the company. But, you do actually have to focus on how you pay people, too. I mean, there\u2019s only so much you can do. You\u2019ve got to be creating opportunities for wealth generation for your team and, as I said, that\u2019s what\u2019s got to be exciting to you and what\u2019s gotta be driving. Tim Ferriss: One of the bullets that was suggested to me as a point to explore with you, it\u2019s, in fact, the number one that was suggested by this friend of mine, is accountability. And this is what he wrote, every time something went wrong, he took responsibility. Even right before he left Home Depot and a transition plan was set, up there was a security breach, I think it was 56 million credit card numbers or so, and Frank took the blame, also fixed things fast. He has uncanny self-awareness. Quite separately, I had wanted to chat about this, so the incident response room that was set up on the 20th floor of Home Depot, not headquarters, the store support center. Frank Blake: Got it. Store support center, yeah. Tim Ferriss: How did you handle that crisis? What was your thinking process? Can you just take us through that because I\u2019d really like to kind of explore the macro by digging into the micro? So, maybe we can talk about this. Frank Blake: Home Depot, we had a data breach in September of 2014. In the sort of ironic commentary, in august, we had actually spent a half a day going through with our board why we thought we were in pretty good shape and weren\u2019t gonna have a data breach, but obviously we did. So, once we knew, we went out and made a public announcement right away. I think there was a very nice article written on, hey, you accepted accountability for this. I think another way to look at it is, I mean, really, you had to. I mean, that was not a serious choice, and this is where it actually helped being a lawyer, and understand that the help that the lawyers are gonna give you is not help, because the lawyers are gonna say things like, well, don\u2019t admit that you did anything wrong because then you\u2019re gonna be subject to litigation and all the rest, and you gotta understand that, actually, all that matters is taking care of your customers. So, I actually gave the pen, I said nothing is gonna be written about what we do here from our legal team. Love our legal team, we have great lawyers, but it\u2019s all gonna be written by our person in charge of communications, and all we\u2019re gonna talk about is, as a customer, you\u2019re not liable, and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing for you. And then, we just decided we were gonna be completely transparent so every time we knew something, we said something. It was really painful because the nature of these things is that you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. It unfolds over time and so, we\u2019d have one release after another. It felt like we were constantly in the barrel, but I think people appreciated that we were being transparent and focused on taking care of our customer, and we didn\u2019t really see any significant decline. Tim Ferriss: Was that difficult or an easy conversation to have in terms of how you were choosing to respond? Do you remember sitting down and having that first conversation or any of those? Frank Blake: I do. We set out, here are our three principals. The only thing that matters is how we communicate to the customers. The second thing I tell people, just recognize. The second principal is, recognize, no one is gonna say massive data breach at Home Depot, everybody did things right. So, understand, we screwed up. Don\u2019t worry about that. Worry about fixing it. And I was really pleased and I give a lot of credit to our CIO at the time, Matt Carey. I was really pleased that the experts who kind of came in and cleaned up the situation said that they saw less finger pointing CYA activity with Home Depot than anybody else. So, it was, hey, let\u2019s just move forward and get this thing fixed, and we got through it. I mean, there\u2019s wasn\u2019t a lot of discussion about weighing other alternative approaches. I was very fortunate because my board was entirely supportive of how we handled it. Tim Ferriss: I would imagine having the legal credentials that you do also helps because you can think about it from the perspective of general council, but make the executive decision to do something different. Frank Blake: Exactly, and know that in the end, the value gained from that is modest in terms of the value potentially lost by not being straightforward with your customers. And, frankly, our lawyer was 110 percent behind that, too. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned three principles. Could you review them for us? Frank Blake: Yeah, so it was customers first, no CYA, and fix the problem. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so recognize is related to problem solving. Frank Blake: Right. Tim Ferriss: So, don\u2019t try to spin the facts. Frank Blake: Right. Yep. Tim Ferriss: Were there any decisions that stick out for you as far as the most difficult, or one of the more difficult decisions, conversations you had to have during your tenure at Home Depot? Are there any particularly difficult periods? Because, looking at your resume, I can imagine quite a few people thinking to themselves, my god, this guy just bats 1.000 every time he steps up to the plate, and find it very intimidating, I think, with some understanding, but any particularly difficult times? It doesn\u2019t have to be at Home Depot, in fact. I mean, another question I like to ask and if this is an easier way to go about it, it could be at any point in your career, but a favorite failure, and what I mean by that is a failure that, in some way, set you up for later success. Are there any examples, difficult times, difficult decisions or failures that ended up being for the better? Frank Blake: It\u2019s an embarrassing failure, but I\u2019ll give a failure that was a great wake up for me. So, before I became CEO, one of the things I did for Home Depot is I did our real estate and, as I mentioned, my son worked at the company, still works at the company, but at the time, had just come back from Iraq and started working a store in Depot, and was given, I think, a temporary store assistant manager or a store manager, I can\u2019t remember exactly which, out in Colorado Springs. So, I fly out there to see him and he\u2019s there with four or five of his colleagues who\u2019d also just returned from Iraq, and there telling their stories and I thought I worried about it as a parent, but at the end of it, I was just kind of overwhelmed by, wow, I didn\u2019t worry nearly enough, and these people are just profoundly heroic. So, that was the dinner. Then, in the morning, I say, great, Frank, I gotta drive out and see your store. And, brand new store, so, it was the store I was responsible for, brand new store, and great, here\u2019s the address. And so, I\u2019m driving out to the store. I drive down and I don\u2019t see it. I kind of go three miles up, don\u2019t see it, three miles back, don\u2019t see it, do it again, do it again. And, finally, I see it and the store is hidden by this massive berm along the roadway and there\u2019s this tiny little sign saying Home Depot, and then, the store itself, if you know the construction of the store, the store has beams where they shouldn\u2019t be. And I go, this was my job. It was one. We were doing 200 stores a year at the time. This was my job. This was a number. I was just getting a number out to check my box and this is my son\u2019s damn store. That\u2019s heartbreaking. And my commentary to myself was, personalize this, make this personal, feel it\u2019s personal. Your son may not be doing every job, but pretend that there are people at the end of these decisions and focus on that, and don\u2019t check a number box. As I say, not a happy mistake, failure, but clearly a failure and one, hopefully, I\u2019ll learn from. Tim Ferriss: So, the word worry or worrying has come up quite a bit and it strikes me that perhaps there are different species of worrying in the sense that there is maybe passive worrying where something just eats at you and eats at you and, as I heard someone say to me once, worrying is praying for what you don\u2019t want. And then, perhaps there are other forms of worrying that are more active. So, when something is bothering you or you see a potential risk, what is the thought process or the next steps for you? How do you then take it out of your head so it\u2019s not just acid in the vessel and do something with it? And, any examples? Frank Blake: Well, so, there are different parts of worrying, and just as you said, Tim, there are lots of different ways of worrying. On a personal level, I always found I\u2019d just take the worry to, okay, here are a series of things that can go wrong, every single thing goes wrong, and you could ask my kids, I joke, I always figured I\u2019d end up driving a taxi or an Uber now. Just follow it all through and you\u2019re driving a taxi, and that\u2019s not the end of the world and just deal with it that way. The more constructive worrying is when you actually try to break it down and say, okay, what am I worried about? And, typically, the answer to that is, take the worry from the generic and move it to some level of ground engagement. Go check it out. Go figure out what\u2019s actually happening. Odds are, you\u2019ll be less worried and even if you\u2019re not less worried, odds are, you\u2019ll actually have an answer to how to deal with your worry. Tim Ferriss: So, step number one is fact finding. Frank Blake: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Alright. I read a great book many years ago, so this is another book that has traveled with me, one of the others. So, along with the story of Home Depot, there is one called, How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie. Frank Blake: Oh, okay. Wow, that sounds like a profound book. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a fantastic book and one of the first steps is this fact finding. Don\u2019t assume that your worry is well-founded. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019ve figured it out. Go do some fact finding. After you\u2019ve done that, let\u2019s say perhaps you\u2019re less worried, perhaps you\u2019re more worried, but still worried none the less, this is a legitimate risk, what do you do then? Frank Blake: So, if you ask the people who work for me at Home Depot, and they\u2019d sometimes joke about this, I just would do anxiety transfer. I\u2019d just go, okay, hey, here\u2019s my observation. This isn\u2019t going well. You got it. You got it, you go. Tim Ferriss: Anxiety transfer. Frank Blake: And that is my view of careers. Careers exist, people progress in their lives through solving bigger and bigger problems, so you go here, here\u2019s a problem. Here\u2019s what I see. Tim Ferriss: Here\u2019s a developmental opportunity for you. Frank Blake: Here\u2019s a developmental opportunity, see if you can go fix this, yeah. Tim Ferriss: I was wondering, as you said it, what anxiety transfer would mean. A friend of mine, and he\u2019s a humorist, also a fantastic writer named AJ Jacobs. He writes for Esquire among many other things that he does. And, at one point, he was experimenting with outsourcing to India, the Philippians, and so on, and he was trying to broaden the number of tasks that he could delegate to someone else. Keeping in mind that this is all a bit tongue in cheek, one of the things he did because he is a real worrier, he decided to outsource his worrying. So, whether it was a book deadline or something else, he would ask someone in Bangalore to worry about it for him. Frank Blake: That\u2019s wonderful. I love that. Tim Ferriss: And he told me, he said, it actually worked, just to know that someone was worrying about it on my behalf. Frank Blake: That\u2019s brilliant, I love that. That\u2019s terrific, outsource the worry. Yes, I like that. Tim Ferriss: What advice did you give to your successor at Home Depot? Did you have sort of a presidential meeting, like let me tell you a few things that I\u2019ve learned in the trenches, a few things to keep in mind? Did you have that conversation? Frank Blake: I\u2019m sure we did, but I\u2019m sure he also didn\u2019t need it. Tim Ferriss: But, let\u2019s say that it was someone coming in fresh, so they didn\u2019t have the experience with Home Depot. What advice might you have given them aside from what we\u2019ve discussed so far? Is there anything you would add on top of that? Frank Blake: I think it\u2019s listening, communicating, and getting whatever it is you want as simply stated as possible. So, this is the other part of the legal side, and I can\u2019t remember who said it, but what you always want to get to is simplicity that\u2019s on the other side of complexity. That\u2019s the goal for whatever it is you\u2019re working on, and when you get there, you know you\u2019ve got it and you know you really understand it, and whenever you find yourself just bound up in complexity, you just know you haven\u2019t worked it hard enough. Tim Ferriss: You had mentioned the simple and portable messaging earlier. How would you suggest someone develop that skill or how did you develop that skill? Frank Blake: Think about stories, I think, is the way to start. I mean, listening to your podcast, listening to how you tease out things from people, in the end, you remember stories. And so, if you said this is where I\u2019m trying to go and this is the story around it, you can get pretty simple portable messages. Slogans don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s much better if you can say, here\u2019s the story, here\u2019s what it looks like, because people respond to the stories. Tim Ferriss: Do you remember any stories that you\u2019ve told that have had a particularly large impact or that you\u2019ve just received a lot of positive feedback about? And it harkens back to you talking about reading these passages in your very first sort of address to the troops, but are there any other moments that come to mind? Could be one on one, could be with a smaller group, could be with the entire base of associates. Frank Blake: That\u2019s Home Depot related or broader? Tim Ferriss: Anything. Frank Blake: Aright, so, anything, one of the fun things I\u2019m doing post Home Depot is a podcast, listening to yours and going, gosh, these podcasts are fascinating. So, we do something called Crazy Good Turns, that talks about people who do crazy good things for others. I love it for lots of different reasons, but here\u2019s the story. So, we\u2019ve been doing it for three years and there\u2019s one human story. All of the stories are wonderful, but there\u2019s one in particular that I particularly love. There\u2019s a woman. She happens to live in Atlanta. She\u2019s now around 70 years old. When she was three years old, and she describes very poor circumstances and her mom leaves her in the apartment and goes across the street to get groceries, she\u2019s in the apartment with her sister. She\u2019s playing on the sofa. She finds some matches down in the cushion. She lights them, she\u2019s wearing cotton pajamas, and she goes up like a match. She\u2019s entirely on fire, raced to the hospital, third degree burns covering most of her body. And again, this is now 65, 67 years ago. Massive blood transfusions required, skin grafts, they put out an all point bulletin on a need for blood. A truck driver driving through the town hears this, stops, donates blood, and donates skin, and apparently, the skin graft is one of the most painful operations ever. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I can imagine. Frank Blake: Gets into his truck and drives on. I go, if that\u2019s not the best story ever of people doing something for someone else. That\u2019s my favorite story. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned post Home Depot. What are you focused on these days? What types of projects are keeping your mind occupied? Frank Blake: Yeah. So, this Crazy Good Turns podcast, I have a lot of fun with. I don\u2019t do most of the work on that. The cofounder with me, Brad Shaw, does the real work, and we work together at Home Depot and it goes to the message and the story. And what Brad did at Home Depot was a lot of that storytelling of how you get these messages that are portable that people understand. Tim Ferriss: Was he in coms? Frank Blake: Exactly, he was head of our corporate communications, and did just a phenomenal job, and so, we have great fun working on this podcast. And then, when I started retirement, I had this elegant theory, or I thought it was elegant. I said, I\u2019m gonna spend a third of my time on business stuff, a third of my time on personal stuff, and then a third of my time giving back. And that actually turns out to be sort of a useless way to think about it. Tim Ferriss: Why is that? Frank Blake: Well, it\u2019s sort of choppy and it\u2019s not continuous enough and it struck me recently, in November, this is an interesting story in itself, but I got to spend a day traveling around with Ken Langone. Ken is one of the cofounders of Home Depot. He was my lead director at the start of Home Depot and he\u2019s just one of life\u2019s phenomenal people, and I realized at the end of it that really, what I want to learn is I want to figure out how to be authentically generous. And whatever it is I\u2019m doing, I mean, some people pay me for help, some people don\u2019t pay me for help, people who pay me for help are probably frustrated by it, but it is generosity. So, putting that piece together with Welch\u2019s final advice, and how do you learn to do that? It\u2019s not something that comes naturally to me. I\u2019m not the kind of person who you see the beggar on the street and I reach in my pocket and give a buck. I\u2019m much more the kind of person who\u2019s going, oh, that\u2019s not really gonna help him for the following reasons. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m working on. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to be more genuinely helpful and generous. Tim Ferriss: How are you working on it? Because, it seems like, just like with worry, you have subsets of worry. There are many different ways to be generous and it might mean different things to different people. Frank Blake: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So, how are you working on it? Frank Blake: Yeah and I\u2019m way short, way short, but I know if you kind of work right to left and you go, what do I want people to say? I\u2019d love them to say that, whenever. So, there are small things in terms of just giving. I mean, giving money is one way to do it, trying to be helpful when you do it so that it\u2019s not just writing a check and it actually takes a lot of thought. I\u2019ve learned this. I get to hang around a fair amount with Ken and with Bernie, and Bernie now, what he does is his foundation. That\u2019s what Ken does. How you think about doing that and how you actually think about being helpful to people as you\u2019re generous with your own resources, it\u2019s learning, and I can tell that there are some things I do where I think I\u2019m being helpful where people go, god, that\u2019s fascinating, but keep your help to yourself, and other things I do where I think I\u2019m a little more successful on. Tim Ferriss: What falls in the latter category? Frank Blake: Particularly, people who are starting things and for whatever reason in dealing with their own anxiety, find it helpful to talk to somebody else who\u2019s got some perspective and can help them feel like they\u2019re making progress on whatever direction they\u2019re going. And I think one of the great things that\u2019s true now that wasn\u2019t true when I was growing up is that people are actually really willing to take some risks and do things and start their own businesses and start their own charities and step out, and that\u2019s phenomenal and helping that is great. Tim Ferriss: So, there are probably hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of entrepreneurs listening to this and I\u2019d love to go to some of my well-worn rapid-fire questions, but I might tweak it a little bit. So, I very often ask about the most gifted books or most reread, which I\u2019ll probably ask anyway, but we\u2019re gonna back into that by asking, are there any particular books you would recommend? If you could recommend, say, two or three books, it could be more, to an entrepreneur, maybe they\u2019re a year into their business or in the early stages, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be early stages, I know I\u2019m adding a lot of qualifiers here, but what books might you recommend to them? Frank Blake: So, we talked about one of them. Built from Scratch, I think, is just a great book and any entrepreneur should read it. Saying this, not because I\u2019m on this podcast but because I started listening to your podcast and I think your books are phenomenal, and I think what\u2019s great about them is that you make an effort to kind of pull out from people, here\u2019s what I think is kind of a core part of what makes whatever it is I do successful. And as a reader or as a listener, I can kind of choose. I can say, yeah, okay, that makes sense or, no, boy, that person\u2019s just way away doing something different. I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any one particular. As a business person, I love Jim Collins\u2019s Good to Great. But, you can also look at that and go, oh, this is fascinating because the companies that were originally in Good to Great are now not so great, not even existing. So, you have to be willing to understand that there are lots of different stories and then you find your own within that. So, I\u2019d give your book because I think it\u2019s very cool and I think people have to have more respect for differences and different ways of approaching problems. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s no one path. Frank Blake: No one path. Tim Ferriss: Are there any books besides Built from Scratch that you\u2019ve gifted a lot to other people or reread a lot yourself? Frank Blake: So, the book I tend to gift people has nothing to do with business. It\u2019s a book by a writer called Clive James and it is called Cultural Amnesia. And, first off, he is so learned that you just want to read what he has to say, and I assume he\u2019s not making this up, but he says, well, I wanted to read Proust, but I didn\u2019t know French so I started with [inaudible] and start learning French. And you go, okay, anybody who can do that, I\u2019m interested in what he has to say. But, the book, to me, it\u2019s interesting because it talks about how World War II and the guilt around World War II, particularly in Europe, infected all of the sort of liberal arts world and the unwillingness to actually face into the fact that there was more collaboration than people wanted to admit. And so, oftentimes, the people that were truly heroic are actually heavily criticized because the people who were less than heroic couldn\u2019t stand the comparisons and you go through all of these different literary figures and you go, whoa, didn\u2019t know that back story, that\u2019s pretty interesting. Tim Ferriss: So, Cultural Amnesia, is it a collection of examples and narratives? Frank Blake: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m just trying to make sure I\u2019m clear. Frank Blake: Yes. He goes through different authors. Tim Ferriss: And these are people who are chopped down by their contemporaries because of their success? Frank Blake: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Huh. Frank Blake: Or venerated now, but no one really sees through to, hey, maybe there are more feet of clay than you want to say. Tim Ferriss: That sound fantastic. I want to check that out. And now, do you give that to people? Let me spit out what was on top of my brain, which was, it reminds me of a quote from Francis Ford Coppola when he was being interviewed by a friend of mine Robert Rodriguez whose here in Austin, filmmaker, and I think it was during this interview that he said, I\u2019m paraphrasing but, of course Francis Ford Coppola, one of the greats, and he said, the same things that get you fired when you\u2019re younger are the things they give you lifetime achievement awards for when your older, which I thought was a keen observation. Frank Blake: Great line. Tim Ferriss: Do you give this to people to embolden them to give them courage to do things with the expectation of facing that type of blowback, or why do you give this book? Frank Blake: So, the Cultural Amnesia is the subtext of what he\u2019s talking about, but he also is just such a great observer of different writers, and it makes you want to read all of the source material that he\u2019s writing about. So, if you like reading books, and I like reading books, it\u2019s one of those books that, first, as I say, you go, this may be the smartest human being who\u2019s ever put pen to paper and he\u2019s just brilliantly smart. And, secondly, that\u2019s an interesting way to look at history and how history has impacted things, but it\u2019s more just, do you love books and do you love these authors? Tim Ferriss: Are there any books that you\u2019ve finished recently or that you\u2019re reading currently? Frank Blake: So, the book that I just finished recently, it\u2019s not a full-fledged book, so, it\u2019s real short, 300 Arguments by Sarah Manguso. And it\u2019s kind of a neat book because her objective is, I\u2019m gonna reduce this book to the 300 things that you\u2019d underline if I wrote a real book. You could read it in less than an hour but it\u2019s kind of mundane. It\u2019s like little statements. Tim Ferriss: Lots of aphorisms. Frank Blake: Little aphorisms. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the theme of the book? Frank Blake: Great question, and if I were a deeper reader, I\u2019d probably be able to tell you the theme, and I\u2019m probably doing her book massive injustice by not knowing what the theme is. To me, it was sort of a random set. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s an eclectic mix. Frank Blake: Yeah, I mean, it just bounces around with different observations, some of which you go, god, that\u2019s brilliant and some of it, eh. Tim Ferriss: How did you choose that book? And I guess the broader questions is, how do you choose books? Because we all have finite time on this planet, how do you go about choosing books? Frank Blake: So, on that one, I can\u2019t remember what the path was that got me to this guy who writes a blog, Austin Kleon. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Austin Kleon. Also and Austinite, he\u2019s also here. Frank Blake: Oh, no kidding. Alright, so I don\u2019t know quite why I got to his. Tim Ferriss: Steal Like an Artists, I think, is one of his books. He has a number. Frank Blake: So, I start reading his blog and he had something that said, here are the 15 best books I read in 2017. And I go, done, I\u2019m gonna read the 15, and that was one of the books. He had some others and I\u2019m going through them. I\u2019m gonna go through all 15. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s amazing. A little Austin. Good work, sir. This next question is very much a left turn and it\u2019s a hit-or-miss question. So, if it\u2019s a flub on my side, we can skip it, but what is the purchase of $100.00 or less, could be $1,000.00 or less, whatever, that comes to mind that has positively impacted your life in the last year or two? Does anything come to mind? Frank Blake: So, if I can bump it up above $200.00, it is shoes. So, recognize that I spent years walking concrete floors and as I as saying about my back thing, shoes are just hugely important. So, I got a shoe that I really like. Tim Ferriss: What is the shoe? Frank Blake: So, it is Sam Hubbard shoes. Tim Ferriss: Sam Hubbard. Frank Blake: Yeah. For the last however many years, I don\u2019t have the patience to actually go through the right sizing, and so, I never wear the right size shoes and it\u2019s just been an enormous frustration. And I finally found a pair of shoes I really like. Tim Ferriss: Sam Hubbard. Frank Blake: Big fan of shoes. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I became fixated on shoes at one point because, as backstory, I\u2019d been extremely stingy. Stingy sounds too Scrooge McDuck. Cheap, economical for my entire life, really. I mean, I was the guy who would have his girlfriend complain about the single ply toilet paper and be like, really, Tim? Can we just get two ply? This is terrible. And I would always buy the cheapest shoes that seemed comfortable and were tolerable to my girlfriend, aesthetically. And, at one point, I was in Panama taking to this wonderful woman who is the wife of this gent who, at one point, had owned the largest brewery in Panama, maybe Central America, and really wise woman. And she said to me, you know, Tim? Because she was looking at my shoes, and I just had nothing appropriate for Panama, she said, there are two places you should really spend money, she said, if necessary, your mattress and your shoes, because if you\u2019re not in one you\u2019re going to be in the other, and I was like, whoa. Frank Blake: Yep, that\u2019s great advice. That is phenomenal advice. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so the Sam Hubbard, I mean, I really pay attention to shoes now. Well, I should say, what contributed to that or reinforced it was my experience in writing about cooking, and you have line cooks who are standing all day long. Prep, I mean they\u2019re standing all day. A lot of them wear shoes designed for hospital use. They\u2019re these slip-on shoes that are used by nurses and doctors. Fantastic, alright, well I have a shoe type to check out. If you were to teach a class to, let\u2019s call it, high school seniors or college students, you could pick the grade and, actually, you could pick any grade, what class would you teach and why? Frank Blake: History, just because history is about people. History, we learn so much from history. I love teaching history. I wasn\u2019t a great history student, but when you think about what books are fun to read, it\u2019s great to read history books. Tim Ferriss: Any particular focus? What would the course description look like? Frank Blake: I like American history. I\u2019m not that familiar, I haven\u2019t spent enough time to know the history of other countries, but I think our history is unbelievably complex and fascinating. I\u2019ve been going through the Oxford history of the United States, sort of book by book, and they get maybe more deeply in than I might want to, but it\u2019s fascinating. It\u2019s great. Tim Ferriss: Is there any particular historical figure from US history? That was a little department of redundancy department, but that\u2019s okay, Is there any historical figure in the US you would particularly have liked to meet or have dinner with? Does anyone come to mind? Frank Blake: Boy, there are so many. Tim Ferriss: You could list more than one. Frank Blake: You could have a lot of fascinating people. Truman would be interesting, and Eisenhower would be interesting. I think both of those characters for the decisions they faced and, obviously, Eisenhower, he was the president that I grew up with and so much deeper than any picture we have of him. That would be interesting. Tim Ferriss: Eisenhower gets used a lot as an example by Peter Drucker as an effective executive. Frank Blake: I believe it. The military has so many great learnings on leadership. Tim Ferriss: A lot to be borrowed. Frank Blake: A lot. Tim Ferriss: A lot to be borrowed there, for sure. Alright, last few questions. If you could put anything on a billboard, metaphorically speaking, so a word a sentence, a quote, could be yours or someone else\u2019s, to get out to millions or billions of people, what might you put on that? Frank Blake: It would be, the only blessings you own are the ones you share. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I love that. Frank Blake: The most fun thing about this Crazy Good Turns thing is seeing the people who live that every day, who are seeing things, seeing plights, people in need. I mean, there\u2019s a great one. I could go on and on about this, but there\u2019s a great story on, who knew that there were homeless people living in tunnels under Las Vegas? And then, here\u2019s a guy who recognizes this and goes and takes care of the homeless people in tunnels in Las Vegas and you go, wow, that\u2019s amazing. More of that, please. Tim Ferriss: So, Crazy Good Turns, if you wanted to get someone hooked on Crazy Good Turns are there one or two episodes that you might suggest they start with? Frank Blake: I would start at the start, so Team Rubicon, we did an early one on Team Rubicon, which is the group of Iraqi and Afghan war veterans who\u2019ve come back, and people are probably familiar with them. They use their military training to go, if there\u2019s flood, they go and address the flood. It\u2019s an amazing group. I mean, it\u2019s like kids, which are your favorite kids, so that\u2019s the first one, but every single one of them. And then, I think the second one we did was about Tunnels to Tower, you know the story of the guy who was the fireman on his day off and the twin towers are hit, and he\u2019s driving in to help his colleagues and the tunnel is backed up, and so, he puts on all his gear and runs through the tunnel to the towers and, unfortunaTim:tely, died and then there\u2019s now a run every year through the tower in commemoration of that. So, I\u2019d start with the start and the first ones, but I love them all. There, as I say, it\u2019s like choosing among kids. Tim Ferriss: Why did you create it or why did you co-create it? Why out this into the world? I mean, I know it takes effort. Frank Blake: My first comment to Brad Shaw, the guy who does it with me, is that if eight people listen to this, I\u2019ll be thrilled because I just want to take someone who\u2019s done amazing things and talk about them, and just have them have a notion that someone\u2019s gonna spend, ours are short, 25 minutes talking about the great thing they do. And then, Brad did such a good job of it that now we\u2019re saying, okay, we want people to listen to it, but it goes back to the concept of celebrating. Whatever it is you want, celebrate and highlight it and tell stories about it, and we connect from hearing these stories and sometimes you go, wow, this person\u2019s just so much better a person than I\u2019m ever gonna be that forget it. That\u2019s out of the ballpark, but it\u2019s still inspirational, and then, some of them, you go, oh, yeah, okay. I can do that. Tim Ferriss: Maybe I\u2019ll correct course one day. Frank Blake: Right, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, for all of you who complain that my interviews are too long, I mean, certainly many of you listen to the entire interview, but if you\u2019d like a short form fix, you should check out Crazy Good Turns. And, I don\u2019t do this very much, but I\u2019m gonna make an ask of the audience and then I\u2019m going to ask you if you have any parting words, suggestions, advice, or asks of the audience. Beyond checking out Crazy Good Turns, I would challenge everyone listening for a day, maybe a week, to not criticize, so to try to put into practice what we\u2019ve been taking about and that is highlighting and applauding what it is you want to see more of in the world. If you someone online who\u2019s doing something great, who is making sacrifices for the greater good, practice applauding that because if you do criticize, and the criticism online is certainly 99 percent of what we see, but practice makes perfect, even if the practice isn\u2019t a good practice. So, if you focus on being critical, you\u2019ll get better at it and it\u2019ll become easier. So, for a day, for a week, try to focus on applauding what it is you want to see more of out in the world. So, that would be my challenge, my suggestion to everybody who is listening to this, and I will do the same for myself. I will eat my own dog food on that one. So, any parting words, suggestions? Frank Blake: Well, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m not gonna begin to improve on that. That is brilliant and it is so true. If you take time to recognize and appreciate other people, it bounces back, it gives back, so, very cool. Tim Ferriss: Perfect, well, sorry to go first, but I wanted to get that out because I feel so strongly about it. Frank Blake: No, so well said. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s so much negativity out in the world, you and I, none of us have to create more of it. There\u2019s a surplus of negativity. So, try to focus on increasing the positivity and you don\u2019t get the positive just by shutting down the negative. That void doesn\u2019t fill itself. Where can people learn more about you, find you online, if there is any way that you would like to share, and, of course, everyone who is listening to this, you can find the show notes with the links to everything, including Crazy Good Turns and so on, at tim.blog/podcast. But, are there any other places people can say hello or learn more about what you\u2019re up to? Frank Blake: @FrankBlake on twitter. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good place. Frank Blake: That\u2019s probably the dominant in addition to the Crazy Good Turns. Tim Ferriss: Fantastic. Well, Frank, thank you so much for your time. Frank Blake: What a treat, thank you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this was a lot of fun and for everyone out there on the interwebs, wherever you may be, as always, thank you for listening, talk to you next time.

the inverted pyramid as my first communication to our associates", "and then, for the next eight years as ceo, i spent time figuring out, what does that actually mean", "how do you lead from an inverted pyramid perspective and what are the leadership lessons you pull from that", "so, yes, hugely important book", "it\u2019s a great book", "unfortunately, it\u2019s out of print but i\u2019m

politics, so i worked on campaigns", "when i got out of college, i worked in the state legislature in massachusetts", "after i went to law school, i then ended up in washington, dc", "i had a very traditional washington, dc lawyer government career, moved back and forth from private practice and into the government, so politic fascinate me", "i was interested in politics", "why did it fascinate you", "what led to that, or what about it", "i think you start by the issues being so interesting", "you think you can impact people\u2019s lives", "power is a fascinating thing and so, politics is a source of power and it\u2019s fascinating because of it", "did you experience conversations about politics over the dinner table or how were you introduced to it", "not a bit", "not a bit", "not a bit", "no, not a bit", "it was entirely self-generated", "i don\u2019t know where it came from, but no one else was remotely interested in politics", "that was my thing", "okay", "so, as i was mentioning before we start recording, i\u2019ve had a hell of a time trying to figure out what path to take with this conversation because you have such an eclectic background, and people will have heard, certainly, a fair amount of this in the introduction, but i\u2019ll just mention a few things and then i\u2019ll get to the question", "so, you have law clerk for supreme court justice, general counsel for ge \u2013 i\u2019m skipping a lot \u2013 deputy secretary", "now, do you say deputy secretary of the department of energy or is it better to just say deputy secretary of energy", "department of energy", "there we go", "alright, and then ceo of home depot, and then, certainly, at least as one of our mutual friends has put it, you are the least retired, retired person he knows", "i have a lot of friends who are lawyers, a lot of friends who are lawyers, formal lawyers, and they tend to be very certainty-focused and averse to entrepreneurship", "so, how have you, and if this is even accurate, ended up with this combination of very strong legal background and ability to manage amidst uncertainty, and combine those two", "it\u2019s really unusual, from my experience, at least", "probably an awful lot accidental, so the first part accidental was a group of us set up our own law firm", "so, there were 12 of us who set up our own law firm and that was kind of my first experience with entrepreneurial activity", "the firm did great", "most of my instincts, actually, looking back, are pretty funny because i was wrong", "so, that was an introduction to entrepreneurial activity", "i left washington to go to ge to be the general counsel of a business in schenectady, new york, and everybody thought, that\u2019s the stupidest thing we\u2019ve ever heard", "why would you leave washington, a great legal practice, and go to schenectady", "and mostly, by that time, i was kind of sick of politics and sick of washington", "and i was the beneficiary of the way ge did hr", "basically, they move people around every 18 months, but they never bothered to move the lawyers because they\u2019re not going to bother to move the lawyers", "so, after about five or six years, i\u2019m the person around the table who sort of knows how the business works and i\u2019ve listened to this and i\u2019ve observed over time, and they offered me a job going onto the business side and then the rest of it", "being a lawyer is great, having been a lawyer is even better, so i really enjoyed the business side this out so i really i really enjoyed the business side and found in much, much more fascinating than the legal side", "how did you make the decision", "walk us through making the decision to leave the law practice and take the job at ge, because that could be a scary step", "and i know, certainly, looking around myself at my friends who have what most people would consider successful legal careers, they often pine after these types of changes but very few of them actually take the leap", "so, how did you make that decision", "there were two things", "the first, just as a scene-setter, it is the case, i have never made, as a salary, more money than i made as a lawyer, so i did more with my draw from the law firm than through to being ceo of the home depot", "so, it was a very good legal practice", "the problem with legal practice, after a while, that you realize is there\u2019s such a disincentive for any kind of efficiency, right", "somebody comes in with a problem and you go, i know this problem, i can name this tune in three notes", "well, no", "actually, that\u2019s not the business model", "you wanna say, oh, boy, that\u2019s a complex symphony", "that\u2019s gonna be 3,000 notes", "and so, the idea of trying to do something that\u2019s cumulative, rather than billing your time by the hour, is really what appealed to me", "and washington is a very-closed little culture, and i wanted just get out of that closed culture", "and schenectady, new york sounded like the far end of the earth", "now, at the time, were you single, married", "married", "you were married", "married", "how did you deliver the news or how did you discuss the possibility of that switch, if you\u2019re comfortable saying", "yeah, i don\u2019t know that we had a lot of discussion around it, but it was clear that i was not", "i just was becoming increasingly unhappy on the legal side", "well, i\u2019m not sure everybody was thrilled", "my family wasn\u2019t thrilled to be moving", "we lived in albany, but to be moving to upstate new york, they rode in with it", "it gets chilly", "i grew up in new york but on long island, but upstate gets chilly for people who haven\u2019t been there", "upstate is chilly", "yeah, it\u2019s very chilly", "ge is another company in addition to home depot", "even though i\u2019ve never done anything myself in any industries related to either, that is fascinating to me", "yes", "when did you first meet jack welch", "oh, early on, and then i ended up as a direct report for jack", "the founders of home depot, bernie marcus, ken langone, arthur blank, they\u2019re extraordinary people", "jack welch is an extraordinary human being", "one of the ways i would describe it is i would never take a phone call from him sitting down", "the energy, just immediately, you stood up to provide an answer to jack", "he was hugely helpful to me while i was the ceo at home depot, got a lot of stories around jack, truly a hero", "yeah, let\u2019s get into it", "this is a long form podcast, so we have the luxury of time", "alright, so this is an arc", "so, i become ceo of the home depot", "i think, alright, now i\u2019m gonna call jack and i\u2019m gonna ask him for some time and kind of give me ceo one-on-one lessons, which i did and he was very nice", "he was down in florida at the time and i said, jack, can i spend a day with you and kind of pick your brains", "he said, great", "and, mind you, i have done hundreds of pitches to jack in my time at ge, and i prepared so hard for this meeting with him", "i could tell you the margin rate of an ant trap", "i mean, i was just into all the details, all the numbers, and i go down and the first thing he says is draw me your org hart", "and we spend the day going through people and it was probably one of the most helpful days of my time", "and i recommend this for anybody, anywhere", "if you find somebody that you really respect who\u2019ll ask you questions and then you just listen to what you\u2019re saying, and in effect, he did that for me on the organization and the people", "and then, every year, i do the same thing", "i\u2019d spend a day with jack every single year", "and this is jumping ahead but i love the story so much", "we can jump around", "so, the eighth year, so my last time, i get to ask the question that\u2019s sort of the moron, stupid question that you wouldn\u2019t dare ask earlier because you wouldn\u2019t be able to get the next meeting with jack", "so, i go, okay, jack, all of the attributes of leadership, if you had to weigh them all and pick one, what is the single most important attribute of leadership", "and his answer shocked me", "he said generosity, and i wouldn\u2019t have predicted it", "it kind of took me by surprise when he said it, and then when he explained it and explained how, as leaders, you need to be fueled by the success of others and how that\u2019s really got to be the driving force", "and i could see that as true for how he ran ge", "it made a lot of sense and it stuck with me ever since", "it was a great lesson", "why was it important in that first meeting that he shifted the focus to the org chart", "what happened", "what were the questions he asked", "what were the important", "so, the great questions were, first, how are you organized", "because that tells a lot about what your priorities are", "and second, he\u2019d be asking about people and i\u2019d find myself, in some instances, kind of making excuses and saying, well, you know, blah-blah-blah, but not really, and then he\u2019d just say, i mean, did you hear what you just said", "what are you gonna do about it", "and it wasn\u2019t his commentary on these people, he didn\u2019t even know them, but listening to his feeding back to me what i was saying and then say, hey, look, you\u2019re not smart enough to do this on your own, so if you\u2019re gonna do this and be successful, you gotta get the right team with you", "for people who don\u2019t know jack, what would you say he\u2019s best known for", "i mean, something that\u2019s stuck with me, and i have great respect for jack and i\u2019ve read a lot about him, but i might be getting the details wrong because it\u2019s been a while, i mean, he\u2019s had the nickname neutron jack", "i think it was the bottom ten percent of performers in ge were let go on an annual basis", "yeah, annual basis", "and was he then asking you about strongest, weakest performers and then asking you why you were keeping or why the weakest performers were continuing to be employed", "so, he wasn\u2019t doing it on a kind of percentage, tell me who lags and who\u2019s ahead", "it was more individual by individual, tell me, describe for me their strengths and weaknesses, go through it", "and what i would say, what jack did particularly impresses me in retrospect because it\u2019s so hard to do", "i go into ge as a lawyer, ge is a finance engineering firm", "we had a great legal team, but still, the lawyers are not at the top of organizational pecking order", "somehow, jack got the sense within me that the path to success in the company was actually to disagree with him and be right, and that\u2019s huge", "and he would say this", "i\u2019d express, wow, in retrospect, jack, that\u2019s so amazing, and he\u2019d say, well, i really don\u2019t need to pay people to tell me i\u2019m right", "i need to pay people who are going to tell me where i\u2019m wrong", "but, organizations are such echo chambers and bernie marcus gave me a great piece of advice", "he gave me tons of pieces of advice that were terrific", "i remember one of them at the start of becoming ceo", "bernie said, okay, let me tell you how this works", "you\u2019re gonna be sitting around a table and you\u2019re going to tell a joke, and all the folks are gonna laugh", "and he said, let me tell you, you\u2019re not funny", "and the point of that is, people are just gonna respond to you the way they think you want them to respond, so eliciting the kind of reaction that jack did for me, which was, hey, it\u2019s okay, actually, to disagree with the boss", "you damn well better be right, but it\u2019s a good thing", "to disagree with the boss is huge", "so, on that point, and i may get the pronunciation wrong, carol tom\u00e9", "yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0at the time, home depot\u2019s cfo, she said that when you arrived, still, and this is a compliment, that you invited conflict into the decision-making process", "and i\u2019ll quote here", "this is from a fortune article", "we were conflict-hesitant", "frank asked a ton of questions that make you say what is working and not working", "so, this is interesting to me", "how do you encourage people to disagree and elicit the bad news or whatever it might be", "how do you do that without also simultaneously or dissipating the fear of getting punished for that", "i think it\u2019s one of the most important things", "so, i have a long discussion around what the inverted pyramid means, but one of the things it means is that everything that\u2019s important, as the ceo, everything that\u2019s important is happening above you with the customers and the front line associates, and the folks who work in the organization, so you\u2019ve got to figure out a way to effectively listen and effectively get them to communicate to you", "i learned, actually, from a board member at home depot, this may be more unique to retail to doing this but it worked, that the best way to do that is if i was walking in a store and we had a particular project, my comment would be why isn\u2019t project x working", "and then they\u2019d go, oh, my gosh", "frank knows that the project isn\u2019t working", "i guess we better say something", "and so, that would actually prompt a conversation", "while, if you said, how\u2019s everything going, in any organization of any size, there\u2019s only one right answer when the boss says, how\u2019s everything going", "the answer is, it\u2019s going great, you\u2019re awesome, please go", "and you need to pullout from people", "every once in a while, somebody would say, why\u2019d you say it\u2019s not working", "it\u2019s working great", "but, more often than not, it would be, oh, well, here\u2019s what\u2019s not happening, here are the issues", "so, there are so many pieces of paper, as you can see, and so many questions that i want to ask, and the next one is really closely related to this and something that i think about a lot and i\u2019ll lead into it in a somewhat confusing way", "the internet is almost all negative feedback", "people get punished and attacked", "however, if you look at, say, operant classical conditioning, mammal training, and human training, positive reinforcement is actually critically important", "so, this is a quote and please correct me if i\u2019m wrong, but i\u2019d love to get some examples of how you have celebrated people\u2019s successes and wins, whether within home depot of elsewhere", "and the quote is, i\u2019m a lawyer, lawyers don\u2019t celebrate shit", "or actually, furthermore, the only way people know what you want is that you celebrate when they get it right", "i\u2019m a lawyer, lawyers don\u2019t celebrate shit", "so, what are concrete examples of how you would do that", "that was actually one of my biggest learnings of the time as ceo, was the importance of celebration", "in fact, what i tell people now is every business person knows the saying that you get what you measure", "i\u2019d say there\u2019s an important, maybe even more important, corollary, you get what you celebrate", "people, just as you say, they reference off of the stories", "they reference off of when you reward someone and make a point of it", "that actually sticks in the mind long after other things are forgotten", "and at depot, we did a lot, in fact, spent a lot of time on this", "personally, i would spend every sunday afternoon writing notes to hourly associates, so, for us, customer service was what we were after", "customer service is such a vague term, and i would write 100 to 200 notes every sunday", "and we had a whole process for rolling up the joan, jane, jack did blank, and it would roll up from the store to the district to the region, and i would write notes saying dear joe or jane", "and it wouldn\u2019t just be, you\u2019re awesome, thank you very much, frank", "it would be, i heard you did, blank, and i\u2019d write out what it was, thank you very much, and send the note out, sign my name", "i have a long thing about note writing and why note-writing is so important", "well, let\u2019s get into it, yeah", "okay", "so, i wondered about the power of that, but early on, i was walking a store and an associate came up to me and said, gee, would you rewriting the note that you sent me", "and i said, no, sure, no problem, but why", "and he said, well, we were all convinced that it was a robo-pen note, and so we put it under water and it leaked, it ran, and so, would you write me another one", "people respond to being recognized", "i learned this", "early in my career, i worked for george bush\u2019s dad when he was vice president", "and so, great thing to work", "i mean, he\u2019s a wonderful human being", "working for the vice president is great because it\u2019s a very small staff so you can actually see what he does", "at the time, this is 1981, ages and ages ago, no computers, but he would come into the office and type out notes", "and you knew that he was typing the notes because the e would be slightly off and there\u2019d be white out", "but, as a staff member, when you go a note from the vice president, you were walking on water", "i mean, you just felt like everything was great", "and i believe that we learn more from those positive stories and recognition than anything else", "in addition, i mean, the notes were kind of my thing, but we also did a video every single week of great customer service, and we put it in that same break room tv", "and you\u2019d video tape the actual associates who were being highlighted", "yeah, we\u2019d retell the story", "we\u2019d retell the story with the associates", "so, there\u2019s be one of these every single week", "we did little books of great associate customer service stories", "if you go into storage, you\u2019ll see people with badges and recognition", "you just don\u2019t communicate", "you can write a memo to someone and think it gets down through an organization but it doesn\u2019t", "it\u2019s when you pull people out and say, here, this is what this person did that was extraordinary, you tell a story it, and everyone remembers that story", "that person\u2019s thrilled and everybody else is going, i want a story told about me, too, i\u2019m doing that kind of stuff as well, and it builds on itself", "i think the number that you mentioned was 350,000 or a few hundred thousand", "right", "no, 350,000, and now they\u2019re over 400,000", "right", "so, if you have 350,000 associates and you\u2019re doing this every week, what are the check boxes or the process for selecting those 200", "i\u2019d love to learn more about that", "no doubt, there are people listening to this, i know there are people listening to this, who run very large organizations and that\u2019s gonna be one of the questions top-of-mind, i would imagine", "so, the great thing about it is you take that, so you say, frank wants to send a note out, then this is where having a new great because then you say, okay, here\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna do it; the stores are going to submit stories of great customer service and the store will submit that to the district, and the district will take its best stories, and the district\u2019s best stories go to the regions, and then the regions all submit them to me", "so, beyond the note writing itself, there\u2019s actually a process for recognition, so, i hope, the better store managers were recognizing every single story that they forwarded on to the district and we\u2019re making a celebration with their associates in that store, same with the districts and same with the regions so that it reinforced itself", "so, it\u2019s not just the one note", "it\u2019s the entire process", "it is why, as i say, people just should spend time thinking about what they\u2019re recognizing and celebrating, they should do it intentionally, they should have a process around it, they should do it consistently, because we talked a lot about company culture, but that\u2019s what really sets the culture", "it\u2019s what everybody is saying", "you want to see the story", "you wanna see what this looks like", "this is what it looks like", "if these letters are going out and people want to receive a letter, they want to be in the video, what were the criteria for good stories", "in other words, these various, say, district managers and so on could have their subjective views of what makes a good customer service story, but did you give them any guidelines at all", "i didn\u2019t", "i\u2019d be honest", "i mean, that\u2019s the important thing about customer service, is it takes lots of different forms, but what we weren\u2019t looking for, and it\u2019s not like this isn\u2019t important, but we weren\u2019t looking for the cashier who stopped the robber", "those are important stories but some companies are more focused on shrink prevention and things like that", "we were focused on customer service, and we had lots of different, i mean, just emotionally powerful people helping other people in the store, phenomenal, phenomenally strong stories", "but no, didn\u2019t set and guidelines", "you mentioned stopping a theft not being a very good example, and what this brings to mind for me is, i think it was andy grove of intel, i might be getting this wrong, i\u2019m sure someone on the internet will correct me if i am, but for every metric they decided to measure which was a positive indicator for the company, andy would insist that they would identify the perverse incentive or correlating metric that they should measure for side effects", "i\u2019m reaching a little bit here but you could see if someone says, of course this is exaggerated but, oh, my god, i could get in the video if i stop a robbery", "who could i hire to simulate a robbery", "and i\u2019ll let my buddy go but i\u2019ll put up a good fight and get in the video", "you mentioned what you celebrate", "i\u2019m sorry, let me get this right", "i just wrote it down", "effectively, you get what you measure, you get what you celebrate", "right", "when you took the reins, what were some of the metrics that you focused on or that the organization focused on", "yeah, so, every retailer, i mean, now, it\u2019s commonplace, but you\u2019d look at what\u2019s called a net promoter score", "if that\u2019s an accurate andy grove quote, i entirely agree with it", "it\u2019s definitely a quote from someone", "definitely a quote from someone and a right quote, because every single metric does have a germ of a problem in it, so you have to be careful", "i mean, we would measure net promoter score, how happy the customers are in the store, but it\u2019s always a reminder that the dominant measure is, how are we doing on sales and profitability", "so, as you move down below that on the metric side, you have to be very careful", "and how do you measure sales", "there are many different ways to doing it, a revenue", "you have revenue per square foot", "you have, say, profit of revenue or net income, whatever it might be per employee", "you have many different approaches you could take", "were there any that were more important than others", "no", "our stores, while they\u2019re very idiosyncratic within the box, they\u2019re very similar", "so, we didn\u2019t have to get very sophisticated on the store side on revenue per square foot", "the merchandising side, you do more of that because you\u2019d wanna say, what\u2019s our return on the space we\u2019re allocating to that merchandise", "you\u2019d mentioned at least once, maybe a few times, how you seem to be the accidental ceo, didn\u2019t expect to be asked to be ceo", "how did they explain it", "or if they didn\u2019t, i\u2019m sure they probably said something", "why were you asked to be ceo", "well, in the end, you need to ask ken langone who was the lead director and the other directors of home depot at the time", "i\u2019ve never really spent time asking them why", "i think they had seen a lot of me because i was in charge of deals, and we did a lot of m&a transactions", "that was as the svp, the senior vice president of corporate business development", "oh, no, that was at ge", "well, i did deals", "so, the job i ended up with at ge was doing m&a", "the job i was doing at home depot was doing m&a", "we went out and we bought a whole series of companies called, at the time, home depot supply that was the largest commercial industrial distributor in the country", "but, i pitched those deals to the board so they saw me a lot, and then the first thing i did when i became ceo is that we need to sell this business and we sold the business", "why did you have to sell the business, or why did you recommend that they sell the business", "the dominant reason for me, personally, and i think that this was organizationally right but i know it was right for me, individually, was saying, to be the best retailer in any space requires 110 percent of the effort", "for me to be the best leader of a retailer is 110 percent-plus of effort, no chance that i can also say, oh, and here\u2019s this other business, this great commercial industrial distribution business, i can be the best ceo in that space, too, just knew that was not gonna be possible", "and so, i said we need to sell it", "is that what you said to convince the board that it was a good idea", "pretty much", "i don\u2019t think i made it that personal, because the company, we\u2019d been losing market share, we were trailing our principle competitor", "i said, we got to be all eyes on the retail business and we gotta get rid of everything that\u2019s a distraction to retail business", "plus, at the time, so i took over right at the start of 2007 and housing crisis, by that point, the clouds were fairly obvious, and so, we knew that we had to make some dramatic changes because things were gonna go downhill fast", "and they went even more downhill and faster than we anticipated", "oh, yeah", "i bought a house in late 2007", "talk about good timing", "yeah, there you go", "in san jose, aka man jose, california, but that\u2019s a separate story", "the decision to divest of hd supply, and i may be misattributing so please correct me if i\u2019m wrong, but it also makes me think of jack welch if i\u2019m getting this right, which is, did he not want every division or product line or company to be an either no", "1 or no", "2 in its category", "he famously had that as an objective", "that did not drive that decision because home depot supply was no", "1", "right, got it", "so, it\u2019s more a matter of focus", "so, it was a matter of focus", "there are some unique individuals like jack who can run a conglomerate, and i would be deep into the details of the business i worked at in ge and jack would still ask questions to me that i\u2019d just slap my head and go, oh, my god, what a great question", "why didn\u2019t i think of that", "i knew, not me", "as i said, running a conglomerate is a big, big challenge and i knew i couldn\u2019t do it", "we\u2019ve talked a bit about your legal background and someone compared you at one point to darwin smith, the attorney turned ceo at kimberly-clark because of how lawyers are trained in conflict how to navigate deep rooted issues, etcetera", "i\u2019ve also noticed that, for instance, if i can\u2019t find a proofreader who is a professional writer, i will ask one of my friends who is a lawyer because they\u2019re very good", "they\u2019re not professional proofreaders, per se, for the type of writing that i do, but they\u2019re very good at spotting language that is nebulous, words that shouldn\u2019t be there", "how did your legal training help you for what came later", "and it might be a chicken and the egg thing", "it could be what helped you to be a good lawyer, but what about those life experiences or that training helped you later, or hurt", "the hurt is easier", "we can start there", "yeah, so, the things that i had to kind of had to hike away from are, for lawyers, everything is gray, right, and you can chew over decisions for a long time and it\u2019s very complex and full of ambiguity", "if you\u2019re leading 350,000 people strong and you\u2019re calling out and your statements are in paragraphs, you\u2019ve lost it right from the start", "so, driving for simple, portable messages, screw the ambiguity", "that is essential", "i actually think it\u2019s essential regardless of whether it\u2019s 350,000 people or three people", "that, you kind of have to train away from", "the part that\u2019s probably good is you\u2019re trained to worry", "lawyers are trained", "i always felt like law school trains you to worry about things that no normal human being would worry about, and so, there is a value as a ceo to worry, but you gotta kind of internalize that as much as possible because the other part, you have to get rid of that worry", "colin powell has a great expression that i deeply believe in, which is optimism is a force multiplier, and in any organization, and this was particularly true, his things were grim, you\u2019ve gotta drive to the optimistic side", "you can\u2019t be going, oh, god, this really could turn out badly", "but, i think, internally, that\u2019s helpful, to worry, to be thinking around the corner, to be thinking what\u2019s gonna go wrong", "just as you said, get that every metric that you put in place comes with its own little seed of destruction, understanding that, being aware of it, don\u2019t tell it to anybody else, so all our stores would net promoter scores", "i wouldn\u2019t tell them, oh, here\u2019s the fascinating flaw in that metric, why you might not want to be committed to that, we\u2019d just go, this is what we\u2019re focused on", "we\u2019re focused on our net promoters", "i\u2019m gonna zoom out but i wanna zoom in for a second just on net promoter score", "how did you all measure that", "it was by surveys on the receipt in the store, and so, you can immediately imagine, not to get into the nitty gritty what\u2019s wrong with net promoter scores", "no, let\u2019s get into it", "but, you can imagine, one of the things is the more crowded your store is, the more volume your store does, by and large, that correlated to a net promoter score that was a little bit lower", "if you wanted the highest net promoter score, have a store that very few people went to", "right, one customer per employee per day", "right, exactly, and they were thrilled, and they\u2019d give you the positive feedback", "but yeah, we did it straight off of receipts and people typing in and saying whether they were happy or they weren\u2019t happy", "and then, now, on the internet, obviously, it\u2019s a lot easier", "foresee surveys come up all the time", "it\u2019s also a lot easier to, as you noted, get lost in the seeds of destruction or the noise, right, because if you have a net promoter score also, at least of some types, you can a selection bias for people who are unhappy, which is super tough, right", "yep, exactly", "zooming out, i want to do right now and look at what you said about keeping a lot of that worry and potential downside inside", "this is a huge challenge for a lot of founders and ceos that i know where they have to really put on the brave face and help everyone march to optimism while keeping any of the concerns they might have inside, or at least not showing it publicly to all the troops", "could you walk us through, if possible, or just describe maybe a period or an instance where you had a lot of that to keep inside and how you dealt with that, because a lot of these ceos feel really alone", "they end up, in some cases, getting health problems", "it\u2019s very, very challenging", "could you give us, maybe, an example of how you\u2019ve contended with that", "the best thing for me, there\u2019s a great saying in retail that now has to be amended because of the internet, but the saying in retail is, all truth is on the floor of the store, so now it\u2019s also online but all truth is on the floor of the store", "the best vehicle for me to deal with those worries was always spending time in the store, and i would try, i didn\u2019t do it religiously every week, but i would do dinners with hourly associates", "wherever i was, i\u2019d try to do one a week with hourly associates, and you pretty quickly get your problems put in perspective and it was hugely valuable to me", "and i remember the first one i did was we fly in and i\u2019m sitting around", "there\u2019s this very nice woman sitting next to me, give or take my age, and i\u2019m complaining about my back, so she says, how you doing, and i say something with my back", "mind you, i\u2019d flown in on a private plane and i\u2019m saying i got my back problems", "and then, i go, how are you", "and she said, well, you know, it\u2019s funny that you say that about your back problem because three months ago, i fractured my spine and i had to be in traction", "and it was really difficult when i started working in the store again and i was in a wheelchair", "we have bulky items and they have to get moved", "i\u2019m complaining", "and i go, wow, that\u2019s amazing, and then she said, well, that wasn\u2019t the really hard part", "the really hard part was i have a 12-year-old developmentally disabled son, and i have to pay them every day and i have to get him in the bath and that was so difficult when i was in the wheelchair", "the fears and worries kind of melt when you see what people are putting up with every day and doing one foot in front of the other, and having a smile and being committed to the people around them", "and so, that gave a sense of perspective that sort of put the earnings per share worries a little in farther focus, and they were always great for that, just amazing", "home depot and both bernie and ken, arthur as well, the great stories of home depot", "now, why built from scratch is such a great book, why it\u2019s such a great idea \u2013 there are some crazy stories in that book", "they\u2019re great", "but, the underlying thing is people who typically start, i come in and i\u2019m shagging carts in the lot, maybe i graduated from high school, i\u2019m not really sure why i\u2019m doing this job, and 80 percent of our store managers started as hourly associates, our upper management started as hourly associates, and it\u2019s these amazing career stories, wealth generation through starting at the bottom in retail", "i was at dinner last week with a friend", "this, i think, happens all the time with bernie and ken and arthur, but if you go, boy, there\u2019s a bell to ring in life, this guy comes up and he\u2019s with his daughter, and he said, i just wanted to introduce my daughter to you because i want to introduce her to the person who\u2019s making her college possible", "and you go, first off, obviously not me, but wow", "that is such an awesome story, and that story is replicated over and over and over at home depot", "bernie and ken and arthur always talk about you have your mission statement and all the rest, but what it\u2019s really about is wealth generation for your associates", "and it ties back to jack\u2019s comment about leadership", "at the end, you could say, wow, these people made their lives and careers from it", "that provides a great perspective on the job", "after leaving home depot, since that time, how have you created a pressure release valve for the worrying or stress in your life", "the first great thing about retirement is the anxiety level drops dramatically", "fewer inputs, yeah", "every day, the thing about a retail businesses is, on your phone, there are your sales, and the it organization is saying, gee, i can give you this by the minute", "and you go, no, i really don\u2019t want it", "excuse me", "i don\u2019t want it by the minute", "so, that anxiety of every day, home depot just reported its results and they\u2019re great results, and craig menear is the ceo now", "he\u2019s doing a phenomenal job, but it is that every day, every day, pressure on delivery that\u2019s good to step away from and good to think about, what are some of the other things you wanna do in your life and focus some time elsewhere", "when it creeps in, is there anything that you like to do, any particular sports or morning routines or anything that you find helpful for managing your state", "there are a lots of things", "because i think your retirement is busier than most people\u2019s careers, in some respects", "you certainly keep yourself occupied, so i\u2019d be curious to hear what routines [inaudible] to you", "the habits are very different now", "pretty much because of starting without a preset set of notions of what i was going to do at home depot, if you asked me what i did at the start of every day as ceo of home depot, no, the compare and contrast \u2013 yeah", "well, let\u2019s do both, if you\u2019re okay with that", "i\u2019m not recommending this", "this is not a good tool but i started every day reading emails from customers, and i did that because in any large organization, it\u2019s really easy to get a false sense from averages and percentages, and then you see, wow, we did that badly and it was a good marker, for me, of how we were doing and what we needed to focus on, and that kind of management by anecdote is actually pretty powerful", "but, i would do that for an hour early in the morning", "i have always gotten up really, really early", "what time is early", "so, i get up about a quarter to 5:00 and i\u2019d usually be in the office by 6:00 and start reading emails", "now, i don\u2019t", "i still get up really early", "now, instead, i start by reading", "this was a habit introduced and i struggle with the notion of an intentional god", "my wife does not", "my wife is a strong believer in an intentional god and we pray in the morning together, and it was awkward", "i\u2019m a new englander", "gosh, we don\u2019t do anything with anyone at that level of intimacy, and that\u2019s actually really an interesting habit to have, because saying things aloud and hearing things in her mind, and then sort of being forced in yourself, okay, what am i grateful for, what am i seeking help for, is really valuable", "so, that\u2019s a different kind of habit", "what is the format", "you don\u2019t have to share the specifics, unless you\u2019re open to doing that, but what is the format of the prayer", "how long does it last and you mentioned maybe some sneak peaks, but i\u2019d love to hear about that because i journal almost every morning and i\u2019m not speaking aloud but there might be some commonalities", "yeah", "no, i suspect", "what is the format that you use", "and so, the format is, there\u2019s a lectionary that tells you what reading, so there are a series of readings", "so, you do a reading, typically from the old testament, the psalms and the new testament is typically how you go", "so, we read, and then we pray", "and my prayers, i\u2019ve gotten better at it because i do think, to the extent you write it down or you say things, it kind of gives context and maybe, in some way, it makes it more likely to happen", "my prayers have tended to be, hey, i hope everything works out and, boy, am i grateful for everything", "my wife would be very specific, and is very specific, about this person need help, this is what i\u2019m gonna do to try to help this person", "my wife, parenthetically, worked for habitat for humanity", "that was her job and she goes to haiti nearly every month", "for a while, she was going almost every other week", "so, she does a lot for other people, but she will mention, here are the people who are in need", "and so, it\u2019s really helpful seeing, okay, that\u2019s what she\u2019s focused on and then it teases out for me, what should i be focused on, who needs help, what should i be doing", "so, if someone were transcribing your prayers, would there be certain categories that tend to pop up more than others, like somebody who needs help and how i\u2019m gonna help them, grateful for x", "yeah", "i need help with x, are there particular buckets that tend to pop up a lot", "it\u2019s other people who need help", "there\u2019s a separate thing of each time, kind of naming two things we\u2019re grateful for and what are we grateful for, and it could be, i\u2019m grateful to be on tim ferris\u2019 podcast", "it\u2019s a good mental exercise to say, hey, there is an enormous amount of stuff to be grateful for and then there are people who need help", "my wife is a much more powerful prayer than i am, but i\u2019m learning", "i\u2019m getting there", "i really like that", "i don\u2019t pray in the morning, although maybe someone would consider what i do a secular prayer, perhaps, but i do have a gratitude journal and i note the three things that i\u2019m grateful for first thing in the morning, and then i have a handful of prompts that take four to five minutes in the am and then i do a review in the pm, including what am i grateful for that happened today, effectively", "it\u2019s very deceptively powerful", "exactly right", "and, like you mentioned or maybe i\u2019m implying or inferring, it also helps to develop the lens through which you view the rest of the day", "if you buy a car and then all of the sudden you go out and you see your car everywhere, it\u2019s not because everyone went out and copied you and bought your car", "it\u2019s because you have that attune, selective attention", "it\u2019s really powerful", "and it\u2019s a powerful way to get to learn about another person, too, so to get that sense of, oh okay, this is what they\u2019re worried about, this is how they think", "it\u2019s really useful", "i really love that it starts with somebody else who needs help and then grateful for in the sense that it\u2019s not right off the bat beginning with your ask", "that\u2019s really important", "you mentioned checking or reading customer email, so i had read on, i think it was consumerist.com, it\u2019s probably elsewhere, but you gave out your phone number and email", "this is the line that i found on consumerist, use it if you have a persistent problem with home depot that hasn\u2019t been resolved through normal customer service channels", "remember to be polite, professional, and to the point", "and then, there\u2019s a phone number extension dah, dah, dah, and you can also email frank_blake@homedepot.com", "how on earth do you triage that", "did you get fewer email than expected, fewer phone calls", "did you get deluged", "what happens", "a lot", "yeah, a lot", "there are a lot", "there\u2019s a lot and we have a team", "i mean, i think it was hugely important to do", "i did it early on", "i still get customer emails, but we set up an executive resolutions team", "i learned the first weekend on the job when i mistakenly answered my phone not thinking and got a customer that take a long time to get resolved", "so, we have a professional team that goes through those and resolves them, but, for me, what was useful was you see patterns and you go, okay, this is what\u2019s not going well and this is consistent", "it may not be numerically, percentage-wise, that high, but if somebody is taking time out of their day to email the ceo saying this is screwed up, it\u2019s worth listening to", "and then, associates also knew my email and they\u2019d send me, hey, this isn\u2019t going well, you gotta fix this, you gotta fix that, whatever", "what are some of your favorite interactions, or better put, lessons learned, tidbits of wisdom received from bernie marcus", "you said you\u2019d learned a lot", "wow, a lot", "are there any that come to mind", "it could be anything where you\u2019re like, wow, that\u2019s really useful", "the first is, just as i said about avoiding the echo chamber, getting outside of the echo chamber", "i think one of the things that makes home depot such a strong culture is that one of bernie\u2019s other early on comments to me was, look, you have a prominent job, but you don\u2019t have a significant job", "you have a prominent job because you go out and talk to analysts and all the rest of it, but the only significant jobs are the jobs of the people who are helping customers", "and so, everything you do, and that, again, it goes back to the inverted pyramid, everything you do is in support of your front line associates and your customers and that\u2019s how you have to think about the orientation of your business", "the, quote unquote, headquarters in home depot is not called the headquarters, it\u2019s called the store support center", "that\u2019s not that unusual in retail", "the idea is you\u2019re there to support the store", "that\u2019s what you\u2019re there to do", "what are some of the other ingredients, those could be preexisting, so before you arrived, or changes that you and your team helped to make that help foster the orange apron cult, that sort of dedication to customer service, because it seems, at least based on what i\u2019d read, that you really paid a lot of attention to, i\u2019m not gonna say resurrecting it, but really reinforcing that as a core differentiator", "and, again, this is another bernie-ism, but you need to take care of your associates and so, even when things were really tough in the housing downturn, we were giving our hourly associates pay raises and bonuses when we weren\u2019t in the store support center", "our assistant store managers get stock grants, which i don\u2019t think any other retailer anywhere near home depot\u2019s size, and now those stock grants, those are worth a lot of money", "so, getting them bought into and understanding that the success of the company is their success, as well", "also, on pay, we instituted a very strong success sharing program, so if your store does well, the associates get an extra bonus", "all of those things to say, look, i can\u2019t expect an associate to care about paying attention to the customer if the company isn\u2019t caring about the associate", "we did lots of other programs and then a lot on the recognition and reward side to reinforce the culture of the company", "but, you do actually have to focus on how you pay people, too", "i mean, there\u2019s only so much you can do", "you\u2019ve got to be creating opportunities for wealth generation for your team and, as i said, that\u2019s what\u2019s got to be exciting to you and what\u2019s gotta be driving", "one of the bullets that was suggested to me as a point to explore with you, it\u2019s, in fact, the number one that was suggested by this friend of mine, is accountability", "and this is what he wrote, every time something went wrong, he took responsibility", "even right before he left home depot and a transition plan was set, up there was a security breach, i think it was 56 million credit card numbers or so, and frank took the blame, also fixed things fast", "he has uncanny self-awareness", "quite separately, i had wanted to chat about this, so the incident response room that was set up on the 20th floor of home depot, not headquarters, the store support center", "got it", "store support center, yeah", "how did you handle that crisis", "what was your thinking process", "can you just take us through that because i\u2019d really like to kind of explore the macro by digging into the micro", "so, maybe we can talk about this", "home depot, we had a data breach in september of 2014", "in the sort of ironic commentary, in august, we had actually spent a half a day going through with our board why we thought we were in pretty good shape and weren\u2019t gonna have a data breach, but obviously we did", "so, once we knew, we went out and made a public announcement right away", "i think there was a very nice article written on, hey, you accepted accountability for this", "i think another way to look at it is, i mean, really, you had to", "i mean, that was not a serious choice, and this is where it actually helped being a lawyer, and understand that the help that the lawyers are gonna give you is not help, because the lawyers are gonna say things like, well, don\u2019t admit that you did anything wrong because then you\u2019re gonna be subject to litigation and all the rest, and you gotta understand that, actually, all that matters is taking care of your customers", "so, i actually gave the pen, i said nothing is gonna be written about what we do here from our legal team", "love our legal team, we have great lawyers, but it\u2019s all gonna be written by our person in charge of communications, and all we\u2019re gonna talk about is, as a customer, you\u2019re not liable, and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing for you", "and then, we just decided we were gonna be completely transparent so every time we knew something, we said something", "it was really painful because the nature of these things is that you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on", "it unfolds over time and so, we\u2019d have one release after another", "it felt like we were constantly in the barrel, but i think people appreciated that we were being transparent and focused on taking care of our customer, and we didn\u2019t really see any significant decline", "was that difficult or an easy conversation to have in terms of how you were choosing to respond", "do you remember sitting down and having that first conversation or any of those", "i do", "we set out, here are our three principals", "the only thing that matters is how we communicate to the customers", "the second thing i tell people, just recognize", "the second principal is, recognize, no one is gonna say massive data breach at home depot, everybody did things right", "so, understand, we screwed up", "don\u2019t worry about that", "worry about fixing it", "and i was really pleased and i give a lot of credit to our cio at the time, matt carey", "i was really pleased that the experts who kind of came in and cleaned up the situation said that they saw less finger pointing cya activity with home depot than anybody else", "so, it was, hey, let\u2019s just move forward and get this thing fixed, and we got through it", "i mean, there\u2019s wasn\u2019t a lot of discussion about weighing other alternative approaches", "i was very fortunate because my board was entirely supportive of how we handled it", "i would imagine having the legal credentials that you do also helps because you can think about it from the perspective of general council, but make the executive decision to do something different", "exactly, and know that in the end, the value gained from that is modest in terms of the value potentially lost by not being straightforward with your customers", "and, frankly, our lawyer was 110 percent behind that, too", "you mentioned three principles", "could you review them for us", "yeah, so it was customers first, no cya, and fix the problem", "okay, so recognize is related to problem solving", "right", "so, don\u2019t try to spin the facts", "right", "yep", "were there any decisions that stick out for you as far as the most difficult, or one of the more difficult decisions, conversations you had to have during your tenure at home depot", "are there any particularly difficult periods", "because, looking at your resume, i can imagine quite a few people thinking to themselves, my god, this guy just bats 1.000 every time he steps up to the plate, and find it very intimidating, i think, with some understanding, but any particularly difficult times", "it doesn\u2019t have to be at home depot, in fact", "i mean, another question i like to ask and if this is an easier way to go about it, it could be at any point in your career, but a favorite failure, and what i mean by that is a failure that, in some way, set you up for later success", "are there any examples, difficult times, difficult decisions or failures that ended up being for the better", "it\u2019s an embarrassing failure, but i\u2019ll give a failure that was a great wake up for me", "so, before i became ceo, one of the things i did for home depot is i did our real estate and, as i mentioned, my son worked at the company, still works at the company, but at the time, had just come back from iraq and started working a store in depot, and was given, i think, a temporary store assistant manager or a store manager, i can\u2019t remember exactly which, out in colorado springs", "so, i fly out there to see him and he\u2019s there with four or five of his colleagues who\u2019d also just returned from iraq, and there telling their stories and i thought i worried about it as a parent, but at the end of it, i was just kind of overwhelmed by, wow, i didn\u2019t worry nearly enough, and these people are just profoundly heroic", "so, that was the dinner", "then, in the morning, i say, great, frank, i gotta drive out and see your store", "and, brand new store, so, it was the store i was responsible for, brand new store, and great, here\u2019s the address", "and so, i\u2019m driving out to the store", "i drive down and i don\u2019t see it", "i kind of go three miles up, don\u2019t see it, three miles back, don\u2019t see it, do it again, do it again", "and, finally, i see it and the store is hidden by this massive berm along the roadway and there\u2019s this tiny little sign saying home depot, and then, the store itself, if you know the construction of the store, the store has beams where they shouldn\u2019t be", "and i go, this was my job", "it was one", "we were doing 200 stores a year at the time", "this was my job", "this was a number", "i was just getting a number out to check my box and this is my son\u2019s damn store", "that\u2019s heartbreaking", "and my commentary to myself was, personalize this, make this personal, feel it\u2019s personal", "your son may not be doing every job, but pretend that there are people at the end of these decisions and focus on that, and don\u2019t check a number box", "as i say, not a happy mistake, failure, but clearly a failure and one, hopefully, i\u2019ll learn from", "so, the word worry or worrying has come up quite a bit and it strikes me that perhaps there are different species of worrying in the sense that there is maybe passive worrying where something just eats at you and eats at you and, as i heard someone say to me once, worrying is praying for what you don\u2019t want", "and then, perhaps there are other forms of worrying that are more active", "so, when something is bothering you or you see a potential risk, what is the thought process or the next steps for you", "how do you then take it out of your head so it\u2019s not just acid in the vessel and do something with it", "and, any examples", "well, so, there are different parts of worrying, and just as you said, tim, there are lots of different ways of worrying", "on a personal level, i always found i\u2019d just take the worry to, okay, here are a series of things that can go wrong, every single thing goes wrong, and you could ask my kids, i joke, i always figured i\u2019d end up driving a taxi or an uber now", "just follow it all through and you\u2019re driving a taxi, and that\u2019s not the end of the world and just deal with it that way", "the more constructive worrying is when you actually try to break it down and say, okay, what am i worried about", "and, typically, the answer to that is, take the worry from the generic and move it to some level of ground engagement", "go check it out", "go figure out what\u2019s actually happening", "odds are, you\u2019ll be less worried and even if you\u2019re not less worried, odds are, you\u2019ll actually have an answer to how to deal with your worry", "so, step number one is fact finding", "yeah", "alright", "i read a great book many years ago, so this is another book that has traveled with me, one of the others", "so, along with the story of home depot, there is one called, how to stop worrying and start living by dale carnegie", "oh, okay", "wow, that sounds like a profound book", "it\u2019s a fantastic book and one of the first steps is this fact finding", "don\u2019t assume that your worry is well-founded", "don\u2019t assume you\u2019ve figured it out", "go do some fact finding", "after you\u2019ve done that, let\u2019s say perhaps you\u2019re less worried, perhaps you\u2019re more worried, but still worried none the less, this is a legitimate risk, what do you do then", "so, if you ask the people who work for me at home depot, and they\u2019d sometimes joke about this, i just would do anxiety transfer", "i\u2019d just go, okay, hey, here\u2019s my observation", "this isn\u2019t going well", "you got it", "you got it, you go", "anxiety transfer", "and that is my view of careers", "careers exist, people progress in their lives through solving bigger and bigger problems, so you go here, here\u2019s a problem", "here\u2019s what i see", "here\u2019s a developmental opportunity for you", "here\u2019s a developmental opportunity, see if you can go fix this, yeah", "i was wondering, as you said it, what anxiety transfer would mean", "a friend of mine, and he\u2019s a humorist, also a fantastic writer named aj jacobs", "he writes for esquire among many other things that he does", "and, at one point, he was experimenting with outsourcing to india, the philippians, and so on, and he was trying to broaden the number of tasks that he could delegate to someone else", "keeping in mind that this is all a bit tongue in cheek, one of the things he did because he is a real worrier, he decided to outsource his worrying", "so, whether it was a book deadline or something else, he would ask someone in bangalore to worry about it for him", "that\u2019s wonderful", "i love that", "and he told me, he said, it actually worked, just to know that someone was worrying about it on my behalf", "that\u2019s brilliant, i love that", "that\u2019s terrific, outsource the worry", "yes, i like that", "what advice did you give to your successor at home depot", "did you have sort of a presidential meeting, like let me tell you a few things that i\u2019ve learned in the trenches, a few things to keep in mind", "did you have that conversation", "i\u2019m sure we did, but i\u2019m sure he also didn\u2019t need it", "but, let\u2019s say that it was someone coming in fresh, so they didn\u2019t have the experience with home depot", "what advice might you have given them aside from what we\u2019ve discussed so far", "is there anything you would add on top of that", "i think it\u2019s listening, communicating, and getting whatever it is you want as simply stated as possible", "so, this is the other part of the legal side, and i can\u2019t remember who said it, but what you always want to get to is simplicity that\u2019s on the other side of complexity", "that\u2019s the goal for whatever it is you\u2019re working on, and when you get there, you know you\u2019ve got it and you know you really understand it, and whenever you find yourself just bound up in complexity, you just know you haven\u2019t worked it hard enough", "you had mentioned the simple and portable messaging earlier", "how would you suggest someone develop that skill or how did you develop that skill", "think about stories, i think, is the way to start", "i mean, listening to your podcast, listening to how you tease out things from people, in the end, you remember stories", "and so, if you said this is where i\u2019m trying to go and this is the story around it, you can get pretty simple portable messages", "slogans don\u2019t do it", "it\u2019s much better if you can say, here\u2019s the story, here\u2019s what it looks like, because people respond to the stories", "do you remember any stories that you\u2019ve told that have had a particularly large impact or that you\u2019ve just received a lot of positive feedback about", "and it harkens back to you talking about reading these passages in your very first sort of address to the troops, but are there any other moments that come to mind", "could be one on one, could be with a smaller group, could be with the entire base of associates", "that\u2019s home depot related or broader", "anything", "aright, so, anything, one of the fun things i\u2019m doing post home depot is a podcast, listening to yours and going, gosh, these podcasts are fascinating", "so, we do something called crazy good turns, that talks about people who do crazy good things for others", "i love it for lots of different reasons, but here\u2019s the story", "so, we\u2019ve been doing it for three years and there\u2019s one human story", "all of the stories are wonderful, but there\u2019s one in particular that i particularly love", "there\u2019s a woman", "she happens to live in atlanta", "she\u2019s now around 70 years old", "when she was three years old, and she describes very poor circumstances and her mom leaves her in the apartment and goes across the street to get groceries, she\u2019s in the apartment with her sister", "she\u2019s playing on the sofa", "she finds some matches down in the cushion", "she lights them, she\u2019s wearing cotton pajamas, and she goes up like a match", "she\u2019s entirely on fire, raced to the hospital, third degree burns covering most of her body", "and again, this is now 65, 67 years ago", "massive blood transfusions required, skin grafts, they put out an all point bulletin on a need for blood", "a truck driver driving through the town hears this, stops, donates blood, and donates skin, and apparently, the skin graft is one of the most painful operations ever", "oh, i can imagine", "gets into his truck and drives on", "i go, if that\u2019s not the best story ever of people doing something for someone else", "that\u2019s my favorite story", "you mentioned post home depot", "what are you focused on these days", "what types of projects are keeping your mind occupied", "yeah", "so, this crazy good turns podcast, i have a lot of fun with", "i don\u2019t do most of the work on that", "the cofounder with me, brad shaw, does the real work, and we work together at home depot and it goes to the message and the story", "and what brad did at home depot was a lot of that storytelling of how you get these messages that are portable that people understand", "was he in coms", "exactly, he was head of our corporate communications, and did just a phenomenal job, and so, we have great fun working on this podcast", "and then, when i started retirement, i had this elegant theory, or i thought it was elegant", "i said, i\u2019m gonna spend a third of my time on business stuff, a third of my time on personal stuff, and then a third of my time giving back", "and that actually turns out to be sort of a useless way to think about it", "why is that", "well, it\u2019s sort of choppy and it\u2019s not continuous enough and it struck me recently, in november, this is an interesting story in itself, but i got to spend a day traveling around with ken langone", "ken is one of the cofounders of home depot", "he was my lead director at the start of home depot and he\u2019s just one of life\u2019s phenomenal people, and i realized at the end of it that really, what i want to learn is i want to figure out how to be authentically generous", "and whatever it is i\u2019m doing, i mean, some people pay me for help, some people don\u2019t pay me for help, people who pay me for help are probably frustrated by it, but it is generosity", "so, putting that piece together with welch\u2019s final advice, and how do you learn to do that", "it\u2019s not something that comes naturally to me", "i\u2019m not the kind of person who you see the beggar on the street and i reach in my pocket and give a buck", "i\u2019m much more the kind of person who\u2019s going, oh, that\u2019s not really gonna help him for the following reasons", "so, that\u2019s what i\u2019m working on", "i\u2019m trying to figure out how to be more genuinely helpful and generous", "how are you working on it", "because, it seems like, just like with worry, you have subsets of worry", "there are many different ways to be generous and it might mean different things to different people", "right, exactly", "so, how are you working on it", "yeah and i\u2019m way short, way short, but i know if you kind of work right to left and you go, what do i want people to say", "i\u2019d love them to say that, whenever", "so, there are small things in terms of just giving", "i mean, giving money is one way to do it, trying to be helpful when you do it so that it\u2019s not just writing a check and it actually takes a lot of thought", "i\u2019ve learned this", "i get to hang around a fair amount with ken and with bernie, and bernie now, what he does is his foundation", "that\u2019s what ken does", "how you think about doing that and how you actually think about being helpful to people as you\u2019re generous with your own resources, it\u2019s learning, and i can tell that there are some things i do where i think i\u2019m being helpful where people go, god, that\u2019s fascinating, but keep your help to yourself, and other things i do where i think i\u2019m a little more successful on", "what falls in the latter category", "particularly, people who are starting things and for whatever reason in dealing with their own anxiety, find it helpful to talk to somebody else who\u2019s got some perspective and can help them feel like they\u2019re making progress on whatever direction they\u2019re going", "and i think one of the great things that\u2019s true now that wasn\u2019t true when i was growing up is that people are actually really willing to take some risks and do things and start their own businesses and start their own charities and step out, and that\u2019s phenomenal and helping that is great", "so, there are probably hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of entrepreneurs listening to this and i\u2019d love to go to some of my well-worn rapid-fire questions, but i might tweak it a little bit", "so, i very often ask about the most gifted books or most reread, which i\u2019ll probably ask anyway, but we\u2019re gonna back into that by asking, are there any particular books you would recommend", "if you could recommend, say, two or three books, it could be more, to an entrepreneur, maybe they\u2019re a year into their business or in the early stages, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be early stages, i know i\u2019m adding a lot of qualifiers here, but what books might you recommend to them", "so, we talked about one of them", "built from scratch, i think, is just a great book and any entrepreneur should read it", "saying this, not because i\u2019m on this podcast but because i started listening to your podcast and i think your books are phenomenal, and i think what\u2019s great about them is that you make an effort to kind of pull out from people, here\u2019s what i think is kind of a core part of what makes whatever it is i do successful", "and as a reader or as a listener, i can kind of choose", "i can say, yeah, okay, that makes sense or, no, boy, that person\u2019s just way away doing something different", "i don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any one particular", "as a business person, i love jim collins\u2019s good to great", "but, you can also look at that and go, oh, this is fascinating because the companies that were originally in good to great are now not so great, not even existing", "so, you have to be willing to understand that there are lots of different stories and then you find your own within that", "so, i\u2019d give your book because i think it\u2019s very cool and i think people have to have more respect for differences and different ways of approaching problems", "there\u2019s no one path", "no one path", "are there any books besides built from scratch that you\u2019ve gifted a lot to other people or reread a lot yourself", "so, the book i tend to gift people has nothing to do with business", "it\u2019s a book by a writer called clive james and it is called cultural amnesia", "and, first off, he is so learned that you just want to read what he has to say, and i assume he\u2019s not making this up, but he says, well, i wanted to read proust, but i didn\u2019t know french so i started with [inaudible] and start learning french", "and you go, okay, anybody who can do that, i\u2019m interested in what he has to say", "but, the book, to me, it\u2019s interesting because it talks about how world war ii and the guilt around world war ii, particularly in europe, infected all of the sort of liberal arts world and the unwillingness to actually face into the fact that there was more collaboration than people wanted to admit", "and so, oftentimes, the people that were truly heroic are actually heavily criticized because the people who were less than heroic couldn\u2019t stand the comparisons and you go through all of these different literary figures and you go, whoa, didn\u2019t know that back story, that\u2019s pretty interesting", "so, cultural amnesia, is it a collection of examples and narratives", "yes", "i\u2019m just trying to make sure i\u2019m clear", "yes", "he goes through different authors", "and these are people who are chopped down by their contemporaries because of their success", "yes", "huh", "or venerated now, but no one really sees through to, hey, maybe there are more feet of clay than you want to say", "that sound fantastic", "i want to check that out", "and now, do you give that to people", "let me spit out what was on top of my brain, which was, it reminds me of a quote from francis ford coppola when he was being interviewed by a friend of mine robert rodriguez whose here in austin, filmmaker, and i think it was during this interview that he said, i\u2019m paraphrasing but, of course francis ford coppola, one of the greats, and he said, the same things that get you fired when you\u2019re younger are the things they give you lifetime achievement awards for when your older, which i thought was a keen observation", "great line", "do you give this to people to embolden them to give them courage to do things with the expectation of facing that type of blowback, or why do you give this book", "so, the cultural amnesia is the subtext of what he\u2019s talking about, but he also is just such a great observer of different writers, and it makes you want to read all of the source material that he\u2019s writing about", "so, if you like reading books, and i like reading books, it\u2019s one of those books that, first, as i say, you go, this may be the smartest human being who\u2019s ever put pen to paper and he\u2019s just brilliantly smart", "and, secondly, that\u2019s an interesting way to look at history and how history has impacted things, but it\u2019s more just, do you love books and do you love these authors", "are there any books that you\u2019ve finished recently or that you\u2019re reading currently", "so, the book that i just finished recently, it\u2019s not a full-fledged book, so, it\u2019s real short, 300 arguments by sarah manguso", "and it\u2019s kind of a neat book because her objective is, i\u2019m gonna reduce this book to the 300 things that you\u2019d underline if i wrote a real book", "you could read it in less than an hour but it\u2019s kind of mundane", "it\u2019s like little statements", "lots of aphorisms", "little aphorisms", "what\u2019s the theme of the book", "great question, and if i were a deeper reader, i\u2019d probably be able to tell you the theme, and i\u2019m probably doing her book massive injustice by not knowing what the theme is", "to me, it was sort of a random set", "it\u2019s an eclectic mix", "yeah, i mean, it just bounces around with different observations, some of which you go, god, that\u2019s brilliant and some of it, eh", "how did you choose that book", "and i guess the broader questions is, how do you choose books", "because we all have finite time on this planet, how do you go about choosing books", "so, on that one, i can\u2019t remember what the path was that got me to this guy who writes a blog, austin kleon", "yeah, austin kleon", "also and austinite, he\u2019s also here", "oh, no kidding", "alright, so i don\u2019t know quite why i got to his", "steal like an artists, i think, is one of his books", "he has a number", "so, i start reading his blog and he had something that said, here are the 15 best books i read in 2017", "and i go, done, i\u2019m gonna read the 15, and that was one of the books", "he had some others and i\u2019m going through them", "i\u2019m gonna go through all 15", "that\u2019s amazing", "a little austin", "good work, sir", "this next question is very much a left turn and it\u2019s a hit-or-miss question", "so, if it\u2019s a flub on my side, we can skip it, but what is the purchase of $100.00 or less, could be $1,000.00 or less, whatever, that comes to mind that has positively impacted your life in the last year or two", "does anything come to mind", "so, if i can bump it up above $200.00, it is shoes", "so, recognize that i spent years walking concrete floors and as i as saying about my back thing, shoes are just hugely important", "so, i got a shoe that i really like", "what is the shoe", "so, it is sam hubbard shoes", "sam hubbard", "yeah", "for the last however many years, i don\u2019t have the patience to actually go through the right sizing, and so, i never wear the right size shoes and it\u2019s just been an enormous frustration", "and i finally found a pair of shoes i really like", "sam hubbard", "big fan of shoes", "yeah, i became fixated on shoes at one point because, as backstory, i\u2019d been extremely stingy", "stingy sounds too scrooge mcduck", "cheap, economical for my entire life, really", "i mean, i was the guy who would have his girlfriend complain about the single ply toilet paper and be like, really, tim", "can we just get two ply", "this is terrible", "and i would always buy the cheapest shoes that seemed comfortable and were tolerable to my girlfriend, aesthetically", "and, at one point, i was in panama taking to this wonderful woman who is the wife of this gent who, at one point, had owned the largest brewery in panama, maybe central america, and really wise woman", "and she said to me, you know, tim", "because she was looking at my shoes, and i just had nothing appropriate for panama, she said, there are two places you should really spend money, she said, if necessary, your mattress and your shoes, because if you\u2019re not in one you\u2019re going to be in the other, and i was like, whoa", "yep, that\u2019s great advice", "that is phenomenal advice", "yeah, so the sam hubbard, i mean, i really pay attention to shoes now", "well, i should say, what contributed to that or reinforced it was my experience in writing about cooking, and you have line cooks who are standing all day long", "prep, i mean they\u2019re standing all day", "a lot of them wear shoes designed for hospital use", "they\u2019re these slip-on shoes that are used by nurses and doctors", "fantastic, alright, well i have a shoe type to check out", "if you were to teach a class to, let\u2019s call it, high school seniors or college students, you could pick the grade and, actually, you could pick any grade, what class would you teach and why", "history, just because history is about people", "history, we learn so much from history", "i love teaching history", "i wasn\u2019t a great history student, but when you think about what books are fun to read, it\u2019s great to read history books", "any particular focus", "what would the course description look like", "i like american history", "i\u2019m not that familiar, i haven\u2019t spent enough time to know the history of other countries, but i think our history is unbelievably complex and fascinating", "i\u2019ve been going through the oxford history of the united states, sort of book by book, and they get maybe more deeply in than i might want to, but it\u2019s fascinating", "it\u2019s great", "is there any particular historical figure from us history", "that was a little department of redundancy department, but that\u2019s okay, is there any historical figure in the us you would particularly have liked to meet or have dinner with", "does anyone come to mind", "boy, there are so many", "you could list more than one", "you could have a lot of fascinating people", "truman would be interesting, and eisenhower would be interesting", "i think both of those characters for the decisions they faced and, obviously, eisenhower, he was the president that i grew up with and so much deeper than any picture we have of him", "that would be interesting", "eisenhower gets used a lot as an example by peter drucker as an effective executive", "i believe it", "the military has so many great learnings on leadership", "a lot to be borrowed", "a lot", "a lot to be borrowed there, for sure", "alright, last few questions", "if you could put anything on a billboard, metaphorically speaking, so a word a sentence, a quote, could be yours or someone else\u2019s, to get out to millions or billions of people, what might you put on that", "it would be, the only blessings you own are the ones you share", "oh, i love that", "the most fun thing about this crazy good turns thing is seeing the people who live that every day, who are seeing things, seeing plights, people in need", "i mean, there\u2019s a great one", "i could go on and on about this, but there\u2019s a great story on, who knew that there were homeless people living in tunnels under las vegas", "and then, here\u2019s a guy who recognizes this and goes and takes care of the homeless people in tunnels in las vegas and you go, wow, that\u2019s amazing", "more of that, please", "so, crazy good turns, if you wanted to get someone hooked on crazy good turns are there one or two episodes that you might suggest they start with", "i would start at the start, so team rubicon, we did an early one on team rubicon, which is the group of iraqi and afghan war veterans who\u2019ve come back, and people are probably familiar with them", "they use their military training to go, if there\u2019s flood, they go and address the flood", "it\u2019s an amazing group", "i mean, it\u2019s like kids, which are your favorite kids, so that\u2019s the first one, but every single one of them", "and then, i think the second one we did was about tunnels to tower, you know the story of the guy who was the fireman on his day off and the twin towers are hit, and he\u2019s driving in to help his colleagues and the tunnel is backed up, and so, he puts on all his gear and runs through the tunnel to the towers and, unfortunatim:tely, died and then there\u2019s now a run every year through the tower in commemoration of that", "so, i\u2019d start with the start and the first ones, but i love them all", "there, as i say, it\u2019s like choosing among kids", "why did you create it or why did you co-create it", "why out this into the world", "i mean, i know it takes effort", "my first comment to brad shaw, the guy who does it with me, is that if eight people listen to this, i\u2019ll be thrilled because i just want to take someone who\u2019s done amazing things and talk about them, and just have them have a notion that someone\u2019s gonna spend, ours are short, 25 minutes talking about the great thing they do", "and then, brad did such a good job of it that now we\u2019re saying, okay, we want people to listen to it, but it goes back to the concept of celebrating", "whatever it is you want, celebrate and highlight it and tell stories about it, and we connect from hearing these stories and sometimes you go, wow, this person\u2019s just so much better a person than i\u2019m ever gonna be that forget it", "that\u2019s out of the ballpark, but it\u2019s still inspirational, and then, some of them, you go, oh, yeah, okay", "i can do that", "maybe i\u2019ll correct course one day", "right, yeah", "so, for all of you who complain that my interviews are too long, i mean, certainly many of you listen to the entire interview, but if you\u2019d like a short form fix, you should check out crazy good turns", "and, i don\u2019t do this very much, but i\u2019m gonna make an ask of the audience and then i\u2019m going to ask you if you have any parting words, suggestions, advice, or asks of the audience", "beyond checking out crazy good turns, i would challenge everyone listening for a day, maybe a week, to not criticize, so to try to put into practice what we\u2019ve been taking about and that is highlighting and applauding what it is you want to see more of in the world", "if you someone online who\u2019s doing something great, who is making sacrifices for the greater good, practice applauding that because if you do criticize, and the criticism online is certainly 99 percent of what we see, but practice makes perfect, even if the practice isn\u2019t a good practice", "so, if you focus on being critical, you\u2019ll get better at it and it\u2019ll become easier", "so, for a day, for a week, try to focus on applauding what it is you want to see more of out in the world", "so, that would be my challenge, my suggestion to everybody who is listening to this, and i will do the same for myself", "i will eat my own dog food on that one", "so, any parting words, suggestions", "well, that\u2019s great", "i\u2019m not gonna begin to improve on that", "that is brilliant and it is so true", "if you take time to recognize and appreciate other people, it bounces back, it gives back, so, very cool", "perfect, well, sorry to go first, but i wanted to get that out because i feel so strongly about it", "no, so well said", "there\u2019s so much negativity out in the world, you and i, none of us have to create more of it", "there\u2019s a surplus of negativity", "so, try to focus on increasing the positivity and you don\u2019t get the positive just by shutting down the negative", "that void doesn\u2019t fill itself", "where can people learn more about you, find you online, if there is any way that you would like to share, and, of course, everyone who is listening to this, you can find the show notes with the links to everything, including crazy good turns and so on, at tim.blog/podcast", "but, are there any other places people can say hello or learn more about what you\u2019re up to", "@frankblake on twitter", "that\u2019s a good place", "that\u2019s probably the dominant in addition to the crazy good turns", "fantastic", "well, frank, thank you so much for your time", "what a treat, thank you", "yeah, this was a lot of fun and for everyone out there on the interwebs, wherever you may be, as always, thank you for listening, talk to you next time"]}
