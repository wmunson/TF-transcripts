[Foreign Language], or if you prefer Cantonese, [Foreign Language]. I think I mangled that because my Cantonese is [Foreign Language], but Happy New Year, everybody. To all of my first-time and long-term listeners, thank you for joining me once again for another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show. Normally, it is my job to deconstruct a world-class performer over two to three hours of interview to tease out the habits, routines, tactics, and so on that they apply in their lives that you can borrow and apply in your own. It could range from favorite books to nighttime rituals to the first 60 minutes of their day and so on. In this episode, I\u2019m going to take a slightly different approach. Many of you have asked, over the last, say, six months, specifically after reading Tools of Titans and Tribe of Mentors \u2013 my last two books \u2013 how I process all the information that I receive. That also came about because I showed some people a screen shot of the 392,000 unread e-mails that I have. I\u2019ve also been asked how I make sense of the signal versus the noise on social media and, I suppose, delineate between the things that I should try to absorb versus distractions. This episode will cover all of those topics, and it will also answer a few questions that have been asked many times that are popular about building a world-class network and writing books, specifically answering the question, should you write a book, or, if you\u2019re doing it first-person, should I write a book? If you\u2019re asking yourself that, then I have some thoughts because I am constantly asked about book writing and publishing. I hope that this episode, this information helps you to strengthen the signal to discard some of the noise in the upcoming year and that it makes every piece of information that you receive that you choose to process easier to process. So, thanks for listening, and enjoy. Social media, let\u2019s talk about the abusive spouse we all know that we go back to because they give us a flower. We walk back onto the internet, and the first thing that happens is they throw a bring out of a window as we\u2019re walking down the sidewalk, and it catches us in the teeth. Anyway, a little dramatic, maybe, but internet\u2019s a rough place, and social media\u2019s certainly a full contact sport. I do have a few guidelines or policies for myself that help me to maintain my sanity. Number one is that my phone is on airplane mode, I would say, 80 plus percent of my day. It is particularly critical post dinner all the way until I finish my morning routine the next day. My phone is almost never on, or say off of airplane mode, when I\u2019m in bed. I don\u2019t like the health implications, particularly, and I don\u2019t want to go into a reactive mode when I wake up. I want to have my medication and/or exercise and sitting down doing, say, five-minute journal or determining my top one or two priorities for the day while I have my tea. Then and only then, once I\u2019ve calibrated my true north for the day and my one or two must-do to-dos that make everything else on the list easier or irrelevant only then do I open the window, my bullet proof car and let the bullets start whizzing. That I\u2019m only referring to in the case of text messages and, potentially, e-mail. I do not have notifications on my phone for most things. I do not have e-mail notifications. I do not have news notifications. I turned off all news notifications. I have no social media notifications. I want to be able to select the exact times that I engage, if I engage on social media. So, a few thoughts. Number one is that, if you don\u2019t want to amplify something or encourage someone, then starve given say tweet of oxygen. My default action for negativity or tax starve of it oxygen because I\u2019ll have people deliberately attack me just to provoke a response because it will benefit them for me to respond. I very, very, very rarely respond to any type of attack on the internet for many different reasons. Also, because it will then, in almost some cost fallacy type of way engage me and make me feel committed to engaging. If I send a retort, and I think it\u2019s addressed them or, in some way, defeated them, and they respond, I will feel the inclination to respond yet and again, and then you\u2019re just wrestling in the mud with the pig. It makes you filthy; makes the pig happy, so I opt out whenever possible. I don\u2019t remember exactly who this is attributed to, but the quote is, \u201cThe best revenge is living well.\u201d So, that\u2019s how I feel. The best revenge is living well, and the best way to live well is to ignore things. An even better way to live well is to not see things. I never look at, for instance, home screens on, say, Twitter. I will look at my at replies because many of my readers and listeners are very good at finding things I find really, really interesting and fascinating and say, \u201cHey, Tim, I thought you\u2019d really enjoy this study related to A, B, and C. Hey, Tim, you shared this video about blobbity blah in five-bullet Friday newsletter. I thought you\u2019d love this video that very few people have seen outside of Poland.\u201d Awesome, fantastic. That\u2019s the stuff I want to see. So, Twitter is useful for, specifically, looking at feedback via at mentions, but also connecting with celebrities or well-known people, I should say, who then can communicate with you if they follow you or if you can catalyze and you can encourage them to follow you in a bunch of indirect ways, like retweeting things they\u2019ve done, favoriting things they\u2019ve done, following them doing all three of those things at the same time, or in rapid succession. Then you can DM with them, and neither of you has to exchange personal information. That is how I\u2019ve got, probably, 40 of the people who are, in some ways, above my weight class to be involved with Tribe Mentors. The different social media networks also, to me, represent different types of neighborhoods. Twitters, of those I engage with, readily the most poisonous, in a way. It\u2019s not the most violent. There are others that are more violent, but it\u2019s really a street, as I mentioned in the beginning, where you walk down the street, and people are throwing potted plants at your head for no apparent reason and yelling at you and calling you names. It\u2019s really a pretty nasty neighborhood, not very friendly. Facebook is significantly better, I think, in part because there is less anonymity. It\u2019s significantly better in my experience. One level further would be \u2013 maybe it\u2019s just my experience \u2013 but Instagram. I find Instagram to be a much, much friendlier environment. I\u2019m most inclined to look at, say, the entire bulk of comments to a specific post on Instagram because people aren\u2019t dicks as much. They\u2019re still idiots on Instagram. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I also have absolutely no problem with muting or blocking people. If someone comes to my profile to my post and they start berating me, I view that as them coming into my house, kicking off their shoes or keeping their shoes on, putting their feet up on my dinner table and spitting on the floor. They are not invited back. I routinely block and mute without any regard for whether those people are having a bad day and they\u2019re just off. They\u2019re gone. It\u2019s a one strike, you\u2019re out policy. If I feel that I\u2019m already pre-agitated \u2013 meaning, I have a lot going on. I\u2019m feeling somewhat reactive or combative, I think very carefully about going on social media. I think about it specifically at night. Let\u2019s say that I\u2019m going to have a really late dinner. It\u2019s like 10:00 dinner, so I\u2019m probably going to go to bed within the next two hours, and I\u2019m tempted to go Twitter because sometimes I\u2019ll look at my, say \u2013 I\u2019ll look at my verified at mentions. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my god. Such and such basketball player, or such and such director or [inaudible] athlete \u2013 whoever it might be \u2013 listens to my podcast. How cool.\u201d That\u2019s, I would say, 20 percent of the time. Eighty percent of the time, there\u2019s going to be someone who\u2019s like, \u201cTim Ferriss is a stupid blobbity blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\u201d and then I\u2019m going to get my knickers in a twist, and I\u2019m going to be all wound up and potentially angry right before going to bed, the worst possible time for me to be stuck in my head considering hypothetical arguments and how I could win those arguments. Not productive. Not helpful. So, I think about that. If I turn on this phone, and I look at Twitter, there\u2019s an 80 percent chance that I will have a bad outcome. Okay, let\u2019s not do it, and I put it down. Those are a few of the ways that I think about managing social media, so to speak. Managing by neglect and cultivating selecting ignorance, I think, is very, very important because you have, in social media, companies with billions of dollars of capital in R&D and advertising and product development whose sole job is to take you off task. One of the most effective ways to take you off task is to make you angry. This is what many of the polarizing news outlets have figured out and have used for a very, very long time. If it bleeds, it leads. If I can scare you, make you upset, that takes you off task. So, the advertisements that you\u2019re going to see might do that, and, certainly, I think, in today\u2019s political climate, people are more interested in fighting than reconciling. It would appear the vast majority of people are taking what I would consider the lesser route to making themselves feel better. You can make yourself better, or you can make yourself feel better. Those are not the same thing. You make yourself better by evaluating your own weaknesses, by evaluating your own strengths, and working on yourself. It\u2019s hard work. It takes focus, takes dedication. You\u2019ll have painful moments. Ultimately, in the long term, it makes everything easier. As one of my mentors, Jerzy Gregorek would say, \u201cEasy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.\u201d You can make yourself better. If you want to make yourself feel better, you tear other people down, and you throw mud, and you spend time on social media biting ankles. That might feel good in the short term, but, in the long term, you\u2019re going to lose. You\u2019re going to lose in competition, and you\u2019re going to lose your own self-respect. That, I think, is, perhaps, the ultimate travesty. Some thoughts on social media, but focus on making yourself better, not making other people feel worse and yourself feel better. That\u2019s a loser\u2019s game. When in doubt, fucking starve it of oxygen and focus on what you\u2019re supposed to be doing because social isn\u2019t it, generally speaking. Good luck. I get asked a fair amount, \u201cHow do you contend with the sheer volume of information and advice that you hear and receive from, say, podcasts guests?\u201d Because I\u2019m doing six podcast episodes a month. They are two to four hours in length typically. It could seem that I \u2013 and maybe even my listeners \u2013 would be getting waterboarded with details to the extent that they wouldn\u2019t be able to absorb or assimilate them. It\u2019s pretty simple for me. There are a few different tactics and, I would say, beliefs that allow me to get a lot out of it without feeling overwhelmed. The first is actually something that relates to writing after doing extensive research because you suffer from the same problem. I have 15 notebooks with 1,500 pages of notes, and I\u2019m writing a 200-page book, if you\u2019re not me. How am I going to condense all this? How am I going to remember the most important parts? What Cal Fussman \u2013 who is an incredible writer and also very gifted interviewer \u2013 was taught, at one point, by a very famous novelist, and then he told me this story was the good shit sticks. The good shit sticks just means don\u2019t stress about it. The really standout stuff has a strong foothold in your mind. It will either stay with you, or it will come to you when you need it, so have that confidence. If you are paying attention, and you\u2019re present when you take the notes, and you\u2019re present when you are listening to people so that it can make an initial imprint, the good shit sticks. Just have that faith. I hate to use that word, typically, but just have the faith that, if you\u2019re present and really paying attention when you\u2019re reading or writing something down or listening to someone, that the imprint has been made, and the good shit has stuck. That\u2019s number one. Number two is actually brought from Derek Sivers. Very well-known entrepreneur, a philosopher king of sorts in the programming worlds, also a tremendous musician. His policy for evaluating opportunities is, if it\u2019s not a hell yes, it\u2019s a no. If it\u2019s not a hell yes, it\u2019s a decline. I think that, similarly, when I\u2019m interviewing someone, I have a notebook at all times when I\u2019m interviewing someone. If they say something that really grabs me \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s not, \u201cOh, that\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWhoa.\u201d I get pulled by the shirt. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck? Oh, my god, that\u2019s \u2013 I have to do that,\u201d then I note it down. If it\u2019s lukewarm, I don\u2019t highlight it. If it\u2019s lukewarm, kind of cool, I pay attention. It makes the imprint, but I don\u2019t note it down. At the end of, say, any given three-hour interviewer, I may only have four or five highlights of things I want to test. What\u2019s important at that point is that I put it into a calendar. If you want to try something, or if you want to purchase something, within the two hours after that interview, I set down some type of next steps. I either go on, say, Amazon Prime, boom. I bought it. I\u2019ll have it in two days. Or I go into my calendar. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, I want to commit to scheduling, say, voice lessons.\u201d After I did podcast with a very well-known musician, I said, \u201cAll right, I want to schedule voice lessons.\u201d It\u2019s got to be done now, or it\u2019s just never going to happen. As soon as I finished, I got into [inaudible] to communicate with my assistant. I also did some preliminary research, looked at my calendar as to where I would be, thought about what my perimeters and criteria might be, and, boom, it\u2019s in motion. In my world, and in many worlds, if it doesn\u2019t happen now or it\u2019s not put into the calendar, it\u2019s not going to happen. It will never happen. That\u2019s part two. I would also say part three is another belief, and that is you don\u2019t have to do a million things right. You really just have to get a few things right and have first principles, which is why I enjoyed so much my interview with Ray Dalio, who manages the largest hedge fund in the world. He is always thinking about first principles because you have principles, strategies, tactics, and then everything else. For instance, if you want to be an artist, you can use every latest tech tool, the different crayons and markers and pencils and get really stressed out about which of these to use. Ultimately, you need to have the fine motor control, and then you need to have the ability to see. Learning to be an artist or learning to be a physicist, in some ways, is learning how to see, which is what Ed Catmull, president of Pixar, said to me, and I thought very deeply about this. I said, \u201cOkay, this is a first principle. I can think about that, and if I cultivate that skill, my ability to observe, that then filters down to 20 other fields.\u201d If you don\u2019t fixate on the tiny, little tools \u2013 they can be fun, the apps and so on, don\u2019t get me wrong. If it grabs you by the shirt and you\u2019re excited, try it, but you only have to get a few things right. By that, you only need to cultivate a handful of skills \u2013 deal making, negotiating, nonviolent communication, prioritization by, say, reading something like The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker, and you\u2019re good. You\u2019re going to win at the game of life if you don\u2019t drown in the lower level details. Just have the confidence that it\u2019s not about doing a million things right. It\u2019s actually about saying, \u201cYes. Hell yes,\u201d to a handful of things and then saying no thank you to 1,000, 10,000 other things. Those are a few of the approaches that I use, and I, often, will very frequently use Evernote to keep track of different notes that I\u2019ve taken on various interviews. With articles online, for instance, I will pull them using the Evernote clipper offline into Evernote. I will read all these articles in Evernote. When I find little tidbits that I find useful, unlike, say, Kindle where you can highlight things and review your highlights. In Evernote, with something that\u2019s just a mishmash pulled off the internet, what I\u2019ll do is I will put three asterisks before what I find really interesting and then bold and underline it. Then all I need to do is, in those notes, if I want to do a quick refresh on what I found very important at the time, is I will do a control F, which is find. It\u2019ll say, \u201cFound seven instances of star, star, start.\u201d Boom, and then five minutes, I can do my review. I would say, last but not least, try to specialize in, as I mentioned, first principles and those higher-level tools. Secondarily, try to focus \u2013 and Kathy Sierra, who\u2019s amazing, first said it this way to me: On just in time information, not just in case information. If you think about it, how many nonfiction books have you read, and you\u2019re like, \u201cJust in case I need this. I\u2019m interested in \u2013,\u201d I remember, way back in the day, import/export. I want to be an import/export.\u201d This is a long time ago. I read it, and that was with the understanding, but, I suppose not with all too much clarity, that I probably wouldn\u2019t use that for years. What happens? If I need to use it years from then, and it\u2019s a book, I just need to reread the damn book. Instead of doing that, focus on just in time information. It\u2019s like, \u201cAll right, I have this to do tomorrow, next week. These are the ways I can prepare. Boom, and you\u2019re on it,\u201d instead of just in case information. That also relieves a huge psychological burden. Oh, hi, thank you for joining me for another video. This is my dog Molly, and this is a wooden wine glass. I\u2019m going to talk to you about mistakes people make networking. What a dirty word that is, and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about how I\u2019ve built my own network, as it were. My advice, in short, is to go narrow and to go long. That involves deep relationships with a small number of people and then playing the long game. What many people do is they go to an event to collect business cards, and then they follow up with people with whom they have no common interests in the hopes of some type of transaction in the near term, the next few weeks, the next few months. That can work, but what I would suggest you do is, if we\u2019re looking at events, which can be very, very high yield, look at either volunteer events where you can volunteer or super high-end events where you can attend and pay premium to attend. In the former category, I can give you an example of a tipping point for The Four-Hour Work Week, my first book. That came about by going, in part, to South by Southwest 2007. My tactic was, an attendee here, which is fairly expensive, to go to moderated panels. Then, when a panel ended, instead of flooding the scene to get in line to talk to a panelist, I would actually talk to the moderator who people would tend to ignore. I would be very, very humble to the extent I could and say, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time South by Southwest. I\u2019m pretty nervous. I just wrote my first book. I don\u2019t know anybody. I\u2019m not going to pretend to understand everything about tech. I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m really interested in A, B, C, D, and E. I\u2019m originally from this part of the world, and these are some of my interests. Is there anyone you think I might enjoy meeting here?\u201d Now, you have, say, Mary or Joe or whoever saying, \u201cYeah, you should meet Mike such and such.\u201d Then I got and find Mike, or I\u2019m introduced to Mike, and I already have that social stamp of approval of one person. Okay, now, I meet that person. We talk, and there\u2019s no explicit ask. This is really important. I do the same thing. Just got to South by Southwest. My first time here. I apologize kind of. A random introduction, but I don\u2019t know anybody, and I have my first book out. I really don\u2019t know what to do because I have my launch coming up, but I\u2019m here to learn. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m here to learn and meet people. I don\u2019t even know what to ask for. Talk to them. Talk to them. Talk to them. Then, if the timing seems right \u2013 and it may not. May never be right, but if it is, you can ask, \u201cIs there anybody else here you think I should meet up with or buy a drink for? Who can I buy a round of drinks for? Just to have fun. Cool people who I might be able to hang out with and who might enjoy hanging out with me?\u201d Then you go to the second person and so on. Now, all the way up to this point, I\u2019ve not made a single ask other than the question, \u201cIs there anybody else you think I might enjoy meeting?\u201d Now, at some point, you will then have a small gaggle of people and, probably, you\u2019ll be buying booze, at least that\u2019s my tactic. It\u2019s fairly, fairly easy to buy booze for people. Then everyone\u2019s talking. Let\u2019s say you have a group of people in tech, or you have a dog who wants a treat who\u2019s coming back to say hello \u2013 a bunch of people in tech who are talking about tech things, and they\u2019re saying things like, \u201cBlobbity, blobbity, blah, Ruby on Rails,\u201d and I don\u2019t know what that is. As a guy \u2013 I\u2019m talking to the guys here because women generally don\u2019t have this problem. Don\u2019t pretend like you know everything. It\u2019s really not endearing. They would say something like, \u201cBlah, blah, Ruby on Rails,\u201d and I would say, \u201cSo sorry to interrupt. This is deep in the end of my ignorance pool. I don\u2019t know what Ruby on Rails is. What is Ruby on Rails?\u201d Every once in a while, I would interject, and ask for clarification just to learn. Eventually, after two or three rounds of drinks, someone will say, \u201cWho are you again? What do you do? What are you doing here?\u201d Then you can offer a little bit. You say something like, \u201cWell, I just finished my first book. I\u2019m really nervous. It\u2019s coming out on such and such a date, and I don\u2019t know what a book launch is, so I\u2019m here to try to meet people and learn different skills to figure that out.\u201d Then you stop. You don\u2019t give them a two-minute or three-minute pitch. Chances are, someone will ask, \u201cOkay, well, what\u2019s your book about?\u201d Then you can give a little bit more. Then, let\u2019s say you\u2019re in a group of eight people. You watch the one or two who are going to have more follow up questions. Then, eventually, maybe, in a group of eight people, you say to one of them afterwards, you say, \u201cLook, I have a ton of books that my publisher has sent me. These are review copies and advance copies. I don\u2019t know what to do with them. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d actually read the whole book, but there\u2019s a 20-page book that I think you\u2019d really enjoy on X, Y, and Z,\u201d because you know that. You\u2019ve already ascertained it through the conversation you had. You say, \u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be a burden, if you\u2019d enjoy it, maybe I could send it do you. If not, that\u2019s cool. I would say, 90 percent of the time, they said, \u201cYeah, sure. That\u2019d be cool. I\u2019d love to see it.\u201d That\u2019s how it all happened, guys. That\u2019s how the book hit The New York Times bestseller list. Was by doing that over and over again. This is the key point: you don\u2019t have to be a networking whore. You don\u2019t have to sell yourself to the highest bidder or compromise and spend time with people you don\u2019t like. You can find people who are A class players in a given world who you want to spend time with, who have similar values and hobbies. That one person out of the ten who said, \u201cYeah, cool. No, I\u2019d love to check it out \u2013,\u201d the vast majority of those people from 11 years ago are still my friends today. That\u2019s going narrow and going long. All right, should you write a book? Should someone or anyone write a book? I get asked questions about launching books all the time. How can I make my book a bestseller? Have you written a book? No, I\u2019m going to write a book. Have you written any books before? No. Why are you writing a book? We get into this conversation. Ultimately, I ask one question, and that is, for the period of a year, can you make this your number one priority? For a period of at least a year, can this be your number one \u2013 if you have a company, that means your business is number two. If you have a family, that means your family is number two. Can this be your number one priority for a year? That\u2019s the general litmus test because, if you put out a mediocre book or even a good book \u2013 a good enough book, which, by the way, equals shitty as Brian Grazer, legendary film and TV producer would say \u2013 it\u2019s more of a liability than a help. A mediocre book is more of a liability than no book at all. You can\u2019t take it back. As Michael Gerber told me, who wrote The E Myth Revisited, which is a book that had a huge impact on me. Before I launched The Four-Hour Work Week, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to write a book, write a fucking book.\u201d Meaning, you\u2019re all in. All of your chips are into this book. How did I know that I should do The Four-Hour Work Week? Was it that obvious? Was it clear? Was I dying to be a writer \u2013 which, by the way, I don\u2019t think is a necessary check box. You don\u2019t have to write the book yourself, necessary. Open, by Andre Agassi, by the way, [inaudible] \u2013 Andre Agassi was ghostwritten, but it was a collaboration that took a long time and a lot of Andre\u2019s time. Beautifully written, but, nonetheless, required a lot of focus from him. You can have a collaborator. My, I suppose, hurdle was it was easier for me to get out of my head than it was for me to live with it in my head. It was less painful to put it down than to have it ricocheting inside my head. I had all these experiences from 2004 to, say, end of 2005 where I was restructuring and reformulating my entire business to run without me, traveling the world for 18 months without any set schedule, meeting all these case studies. I was teaching a class at Princeton twice a year, sometimes in person, sometimes remotely in high-tech entrepreneurship where I was sharing my findings about scaling a bootstrapped business. That slowly morphed into lifestyle design, how to create a business or career to allow you to take advantage of the most valuable nonrenewable resource, which is time. I\u2019m already giving these two to three-hour classes, and I would take notes. Over time \u2013 because one of the students said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just write a book and be done with it as opposed to teaching a class of 40 students,\u201d which was actually a snarky Princeton student response. It wasn\u2019t a real suggestion, I don\u2019t think. Nonetheless, I had insomnia for many, many, many, many years. I couldn\u2019t get to sleep because these chapter ideas would come. These stories would come to mind, and I just couldn\u2019t get to sleep without jotting down a little note on a piece of paper. I ended up with a huge pile of paper on lessons learned and so on. I knew that at least two of my friends [00:35:20] \u2013 there were two specific friends in mind. One who was trapped in a decent paying job where he had no time, disliked what he was doing, but he could finally afford that nice car \u2013 he felt like he was trapped. Then I had a friend who had started his own company who, similarly, is making decent money, but felt trapped in a monster of his own making. I felt these notes would help them. Did not want to write a book at that point. Actively, did not want to write a book, but I felt a moral obligation to share this material somehow, and a few of my friends who were authors recommended that I explore the path to publishing it. I made a few assumptions going into it because, keep in mind, I did not want to write a book. I assumed it was going to be extremely difficult and brutal to write the book, which it was. We\u2019re talking repeated moments of doubt. I should throw in the towel. I am going to have a nervous breakdown. Repeatedly. That has, more or less, been the case for every book that I\u2019ve written. I\u2019m at five now. The second assumption was that I was going to probably hate the book itself, which I did. That has been largely true for every book I\u2019ve done. Assume that, up until after a book comes out, are you going to look at it and be disappointed with what you\u2019ve produced. Given that, the third assumption was that I would write the book. If it even changed the life of one or two people, that would justify all the pain, all the self-loathing, all the loathing of the book, all of the opportunity cost of putting it together and that, last but not least, it was easier for me, less painful for me to get it out and throw a hail Mary and hope for the best than to keep it inside of me and wonder, what if? So, a lot of different check boxes. The book \u2013 keep in mind, The Four-Hour Work Week was rejected by 27 publishers. Then, when it was finally printed \u2013 first print run was about 10,000 copies. You don\u2019t even get national distribution with that. Nobody really expected a whole lot. Then, with the same amount of focus that I put into the writing, put into launch. Ended up hitting The New York Times bestseller list, and, now, it\u2019s millions of copies in 40 plus languages. I don\u2019t think you get to millions of copies in 40 plus languages trying to write a book for the world that is going to help your business. I just don\u2019t think it happens. I\u2019ve never seen it happen. Instead, check all the boxes that I mentioned, and I wrote this book for two friends very specifically. By personalizing it in that way, by talking to them in a very conversational way, we ended up with the results that we had. Could\u2019ve very easily gone a different direction, but if you can listen to everything I\u2019ve just said, and you think to yourself, \u201cI should write a book,\u201d then, by all means, go for it. For most people, this doesn\u2019t mean I am a great writer, therefore, you need to be a great writer. No, I\u2019m just saying it was less painful for me to put it out than to keep it in my head.

you angry", "this is what many of the polarizing news outlets have figured out and have used for a very, very long time", "if it bleeds, it leads", "if i can scare you, make you upset, that takes you

amount, \u201chow do you contend with the sheer volume of information and advice that you hear and receive from, say, podcasts guests?\u201d because i\u2019m doing six podcast episodes a month", "they

absorb or assimilate them", "it\u2019s pretty simple for me", "there are a few different tactics and, i would say, beliefs that allow me to get a lot out of it without feeling overwhelmed", "the first is actually something that relates to writing after doing extensive research because you suffer from the same problem", "i have 15 notebooks with 1,500 pages of notes, and i\u2019m writing a 200-page

really standout stuff has a strong foothold in your mind", "it will either stay with you, or it will come to you when you need it, so have that confidence", "if you are paying attention, and you\u2019re present when you take the notes, and you\u2019re present when you are listening to people so that it can make an initial imprint, the good shit sticks", "just have that faith", "i hate to use that word, typically, but just have the faith that, if you\u2019re present and really paying attention when you\u2019re reading or writing something down or listening to someone, that the imprint has been made, and the good shit has stuck", "that\u2019s number one", "number two is actually brought from derek sivers", "very well-known entrepreneur, a philosopher king of sorts in the programming worlds, also a tremendous musician", "his policy for evaluating opportunities is, if it\u2019s not a hell yes, it\u2019s a no", "if it\u2019s not a hell yes, it\u2019s a decline", "i think that, similarly, when i\u2019m interviewing someone, i have a notebook at all times when i\u2019m interviewing someone", "if they say something that really grabs me \u2013 i mean, it\u2019s not, \u201coh, that\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cwhoa.\u201d i get pulled by the shirt", "i\u2019m like, \u201cwhat the fuck", "oh, my god, that\u2019s \u2013 i have to do that,\u201d then i note it down", "if it\u2019s lukewarm, i don\u2019t highlight it", "if it\u2019s lukewarm, kind of cool, i pay attention", "it makes the imprint, but i don\u2019t note it down", "at the end of, say, any given three-hour interviewer, i may only have four or five highlights of things i want to test", "what\u2019s important at that point is that i put it into a calendar", "if you want to try something, or if you want to purchase something, within the two hours after that interview, i set down some type of next steps", "i either go on, say, amazon prime, boom", "i bought it", "i\u2019ll have it in two days", "or i go into my calendar", "it\u2019s like, \u201cokay, i want to commit to scheduling, say, voice lessons.\u201d after i did podcast with a very well-known musician, i said, \u201call right, i want to schedule voice lessons.\u201d it\u2019s got to be done now, or it\u2019s just never going to happen", "as soon as i finished, i got into [inaudible] to communicate with my assistant", "i also did some preliminary research, looked at my calendar as to where i would be, thought about what my perimeters and criteria might be, and, boom, it\u2019s in motion", "in my world, and in many worlds, if it doesn\u2019t happen now or it\u2019s not put into the calendar, it\u2019s not going to happen", "it will never happen", "that\u2019s part two", "i would also say part three is another belief, and that is you don\u2019t have to do a million things right", "you really just have to get a few things right and have first principles, which is why i enjoyed so much my interview with ray dalio, who manages the largest hedge fund in the world", "he is always thinking about first principles because you have principles, strategies, tactics, and then everything else", "for instance, if you want to be an artist, you can use every latest tech tool, the different crayons and markers and pencils and get really stressed out about which of these to use", "ultimately, you need to have the fine motor control, and then you need to have the ability to see", "learning to be an artist or learning to be a physicist, in some ways, is learning how to see, which is what ed catmull, president of pixar, said to me, and i thought very deeply about this", "i said, \u201cokay, this is a first principle", "i can think about that, and if i cultivate that skill, my ability to observe, that then filters down to 20 other fields.\u201d if you don\u2019t fixate on the tiny, little tools \u2013 they can be fun, the apps and so on, don\u2019t get me wrong", "if it grabs you by the shirt and you\u2019re excited, try it, but you only have to get a few things right", "by that, you only need to cultivate a handful of skills \u2013 deal making, negotiating, nonviolent communication, prioritization by, say, reading something like the effective executive by peter drucker, and you\u2019re good", "you\u2019re going to win at the game of life if you don\u2019t drown in the lower level details", "just have the confidence that it\u2019s not about doing a million things right", "it\u2019s actually about saying, \u201cyes", "hell yes,\u201d to a handful of things and then saying no thank you to 1,000, 10,000 other things", "those are a few of the approaches that i use, and i, often, will very frequently use evernote to keep track of different notes that i\u2019ve taken on various interviews", "with articles online, for instance, i will pull them using the evernote clipper offline into evernote", "i will read all these articles in evernote", "when i find little tidbits that i find useful, unlike, say, kindle where you can highlight things and review your highlights", "in evernote, with something that\u2019s just a mishmash pulled off the internet, what i\u2019ll do is i will put three asterisks before what i find really interesting and then bold and underline it", "then all i need to do is, in those notes, if i want to do a quick refresh on what i found very important at the time, is i will do a control f, which is find", "it\u2019ll say, \u201cfound seven instances of star, star, start.\u201d boom, and then five minutes, i can do my review", "i would say, last but not least, try to specialize in, as i mentioned, first principles and those higher-level tools", "secondarily, try to focus \u2013 and kathy sierra, who\u2019s amazing, first said it this way to me: on just in time information, not just in case information", "if you think about it, how many nonfiction books have you read, and you\u2019re like, \u201cjust in case i need this", "i\u2019m interested in \u2013,\u201d i remember, way back in the day, import/export", "i want to be an import/export.\u201d this is a long time ago", "i read it, and that was with the understanding, but, i suppose not with all too much clarity, that i probably wouldn\u2019t use that for years", "what happens", "if i need to use it years from then, and it\u2019s a book, i just need to reread the damn book", "instead of doing that, focus on just in time information", "it\u2019s like, \u201call right, i have this to do tomorrow, next week", "these are the ways i can prepare", "boom, and you\u2019re on it,\u201d instead of just in case information", "that also relieves a huge psychological burden", "oh, hi, thank you for joining me for another video", "this is my dog molly, and this is a wooden wine glass", "i\u2019m going to talk to you about mistakes people make networking", "what a dirty word that is, and i\u2019ll talk a little bit about how i\u2019ve built my own network, as it were", "my advice, in short, is to go narrow and to go long", "that involves deep relationships with a small number of people and then playing the long game", "what many people do is they go to an event to collect business cards, and then they follow up with people with whom they have no common interests in the hopes of some type of transaction in the near term, the next few weeks, the next few months", "that can work, but what i would suggest you do is, if we\u2019re looking at events, which can be very, very high yield, look at either volunteer events where you can volunteer or super high-end events where you can attend and pay premium to attend", "in the former category, i can give you an example of a tipping point for the four-hour work week, my first book", "that came about by going, in part, to south by southwest 2007", "my tactic was, an attendee here, which is fairly expensive, to go to moderated panels", "then, when a panel ended, instead of flooding the scene to get in line to talk to a panelist, i would actually talk to the moderator who people would tend to ignore", "i would be very, very humble to the extent i could and say, \u201cit\u2019s my first time south by southwest", "i\u2019m pretty nervous", "i just wrote my first book", "i don\u2019t know anybody", "i\u2019m not going to pretend to understand everything about tech", "i don\u2019t, but i\u2019m really interested in a, b, c, d, and e", "i\u2019m originally from this part of the world, and these are some of my interests", "is there anyone you think i might enjoy meeting here?\u201d now, you have, say, mary or joe or whoever saying, \u201cyeah, you should meet mike such and such.\u201d then i got and find mike, or i\u2019m introduced to mike, and i already have that social stamp of approval of one person", "okay, now, i meet that person", "we talk, and there\u2019s no explicit ask", "this is really important", "i do the same thing", "just got to south by southwest", "my first time here", "i apologize kind of", "a random introduction, but i don\u2019t know anybody, and i have my first book out", "i really don\u2019t know what to do because i have my launch coming up, but i\u2019m here to learn", "that\u2019s it", "i\u2019m here to learn and meet people", "i don\u2019t even know what to ask for", "talk to them", "talk to them", "talk to them", "then, if the timing seems right \u2013 and it may not", "may never be right, but if it is, you can ask, \u201cis there anybody else here you think i should meet up with or buy a drink for", "who can i buy a round of drinks for", "just to have fun", "cool people who i might be able to hang out with and who might enjoy hanging out with me?\u201d then you go to the second person and so on", "now, all the way up to this point, i\u2019ve not made a single ask other than the question, \u201cis there anybody else you think i might enjoy meeting?\u201d now, at some point, you will then have a small gaggle of people and, probably, you\u2019ll be buying booze, at least that\u2019s my tactic", "it\u2019s fairly, fairly easy to buy booze for people", "then everyone\u2019s talking", "let\u2019s say you have a group of people in tech, or you have a dog who wants a treat who\u2019s coming back to say hello \u2013 a bunch of people in tech who are talking about tech things, and they\u2019re saying things like, \u201cblobbity, blobbity, blah, ruby on rails,\u201d and i don\u2019t know what that is", "as a guy \u2013 i\u2019m talking to the guys here because women generally don\u2019t have this problem", "don\u2019t pretend like you know everything", "it\u2019s really not endearing", "they would say something like, \u201cblah, blah, ruby on rails,\u201d and i would say, \u201cso sorry to interrupt", "this is deep in the end of my ignorance pool", "i don\u2019t know what ruby on rails is", "what is ruby on rails?\u201d every once in a while, i would interject, and ask for clarification just to learn", "eventually, after two or three rounds of drinks, someone will say, \u201cwho are you again", "what do you do", "what are you doing here?\u201d then you can offer a little bit", "you say something like, \u201cwell, i just finished my first book", "i\u2019m really nervous", "it\u2019s coming out on such and such a date, and i don\u2019t know what a book launch is, so i\u2019m here to try to meet people and learn different skills to figure that out.\u201d then you stop", "you don\u2019t give them a two-minute or three-minute pitch", "chances are, someone will ask, \u201cokay, well, what\u2019s your book about?\u201d then you can give a little bit more", "then, let\u2019s say you\u2019re in a group of eight people", "you watch the one or two who are going to have more follow up questions", "then, eventually, maybe, in a group of eight people, you say to one of them afterwards, you say, \u201clook, i have a ton of books that my publisher has sent me", "these are review copies and advance copies", "i don\u2019t know what to do with them", "i don\u2019t think you\u2019d actually read the whole book, but there\u2019s a 20-page book that i think you\u2019d really enjoy on x, y, and z,\u201d because you know that", "you\u2019ve already ascertained it through the conversation you had", "you say, \u201cif it wouldn\u2019t be a burden, if you\u2019d enjoy it, maybe i could send it do you", "if not, that\u2019s cool", "i would say, 90 percent of the time, they said, \u201cyeah, sure", "that\u2019d be cool", "i\u2019d love to see it.\u201d that\u2019s how it all happened, guys", "that\u2019s how the book hit the new york times bestseller list", "was by doing that over and over again", "this is the key point: you don\u2019t have to be a networking whore", "you don\u2019t have to sell yourself to the highest bidder or compromise and spend time with people you don\u2019t like", "you can find people who are a class players in a given world who you want to spend time with, who have similar values and hobbies", "that one person out of the ten who said, \u201cyeah, cool", "no, i\u2019d love to check it out \u2013,\u201d the vast majority of those people from 11 years ago are still my friends today", "that\u2019s going narrow and going long", "all right, should you write a book", "should someone or anyone write a book", "i get asked questions about launching books all the time", "how can i make my book a bestseller", "have you written a book", "no, i\u2019m going to write a book", "have you written any books before", "no", "why are you writing a book", "we get into this conversation", "ultimately, i ask one question, and that is, for the period of a year, can you make this your number one priority", "for a period of at least a year, can this be your number one \u2013 if you have a company, that means your business is number two", "if you have a family, that means your family is number two", "can this be your number one priority for a year", "that\u2019s the general litmus test because, if you put out a mediocre book or even a good book \u2013 a good enough book, which, by the way, equals shitty as brian grazer, legendary film and tv producer would say \u2013 it\u2019s more of a liability than a help", "a mediocre book is more of a liability than no book at all", "you can\u2019t take it back", "as michael gerber told me, who wrote the e myth revisited, which is a book that had a huge impact on me", "before i launched the four-hour work week, he said, \u201cif you\u2019re going to write a book, write a fucking book.\u201d meaning, you\u2019re all in", "all of your chips are into this book", "how did i know that i should do the four-hour work week", "was it that obvious", "was it clear", "was i dying to be a writer \u2013 which, by the way, i don\u2019t think is a necessary check box", "you don\u2019t have to write the book yourself, necessary", "open, by andre agassi, by the way, [inaudible] \u2013 andre agassi was ghostwritten, but it was a collaboration that took a long time and a lot of andre\u2019s time", "beautifully written, but, nonetheless, required a lot of focus from him", "you can have a collaborator", "my, i suppose, hurdle was it was easier for me to get out of my head than it was for me to live with it in my head", "it was less painful to put it down than to have it ricocheting inside my head", "i had all these experiences from 2004 to, say, end of 2005 where i was restructuring and reformulating my entire business to run without me, traveling the world for 18 months without any set schedule, meeting all these case studies", "i was teaching a class at princeton twice a year, sometimes in person, sometimes remotely in high-tech entrepreneurship where i was sharing my findings about scaling a bootstrapped business", "that slowly morphed into lifestyle design, how to create a business or career to allow you to take advantage of the most valuable nonrenewable resource, which is time", "i\u2019m already giving these two to three-hour classes, and i would take notes", "over time \u2013 because one of the students said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just write a book and be done with it as opposed to teaching a class of 40 students,\u201d which was actually a snarky princeton student response", "it wasn\u2019t a real suggestion, i don\u2019t think", "nonetheless, i had insomnia for many, many, many, many years", "i couldn\u2019t get to sleep because these chapter ideas would come", "these stories would come to mind, and i just couldn\u2019t get to sleep without jotting down a little note on a piece of paper", "i ended up with a huge pile of paper on lessons learned and so on", "i knew that at least two of my friends [00:35:20] \u2013 there were two specific friends in mind", "one who was trapped in a decent paying job where he had no time, disliked what he was doing, but he could finally afford that nice car \u2013 he felt like he was trapped", "then i had a friend who had started his own company who, similarly, is making decent money, but felt trapped in a monster of his own making", "i felt these notes would help them", "did not want to write a book at that point", "actively, did not want to write a book, but i felt a moral obligation to share this material somehow, and a few of my friends who were authors recommended that i explore the path to publishing it", "i made a few assumptions going into it because, keep in mind, i did not want to write a book", "i assumed it was going to be extremely difficult and brutal to write the book, which it was", "we\u2019re talking repeated moments of doubt", "i should throw in the towel", "i am going to have a nervous breakdown", "repeatedly", "that has, more or less, been the case for every book that i\u2019ve written", "i\u2019m at five now", "the second assumption was that i was going to probably hate the book itself, which i did", "that has been largely true for every book i\u2019ve done", "assume that, up until after a book comes out, are you going to look at it and be disappointed with what you\u2019ve produced", "given that, the third assumption was that i would write the book", "if it even changed the life of one or two people, that would justify all the pain, all the self-loathing, all the loathing of the book, all of the opportunity cost of putting it together and that, last but not least, it was easier for me, less painful for me to get it out and throw a hail mary and hope for the best than to keep it inside of me and wonder, what if", "so, a lot of different check boxes", "the book \u2013 keep in mind, the four-hour work week was rejected by 27 publishers", "then, when it was finally printed \u2013 first print run was about 10,000 copies", "you don\u2019t even get national distribution with that", "nobody really expected a whole lot", "then, with the same amount of focus that i put into the writing, put into launch", "ended up hitting the new york times bestseller list, and, now, it\u2019s millions of copies in 40 plus languages", "i don\u2019t think you get to millions of copies in 40 plus languages trying to write a book for the world that is going to help your business", "i just don\u2019t think it happens", "i\u2019ve never seen it happen", "instead, check all the boxes that i mentioned, and i wrote this book for two friends very specifically", "by personalizing it in that way, by talking to them in a very conversational way, we ended up with the results that we had", "could\u2019ve very easily gone a different direction, but if you can listen to everything i\u2019ve just said, and you think to yourself, \u201ci should write a book,\u201d then, by all means, go for it", "for most people, this doesn\u2019t mean i am a great writer, therefore, you need to be a great writer", "no, i\u2019m just saying it was less painful for me to put it out than to keep it in my head"]}
