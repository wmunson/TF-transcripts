Ferriss: Hello, boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, breakfasts, whatever it might be that you can test and apply in your own life \u2013 the specifics, the details, the beliefs, habits and so on that you can actually use in the real world. In this episode, we have a fantastic guest I\u2019ve wanted to connect with for a very long time \u2013 Darren Aronofsky. Who is Darren? We\u2019re going to get to that in a second. But he was introduced to me by another podcast guest, Peter Attia, who is a medical doctor, an endurance athlete, or he would say a former endurance athlete. I encourage you to also check out his episodes because it will put a lot in context. Peter has three episodes. If you just go to tim.blog/attia, you will find three of them. They start with Dr. Peter Attia on life extension, drinking jet fuel, ultra-endurance, human fois gras and more. To the next one, optimizing investing, blood, hormones, and life. Then, my life extension pilgrimage to Easter Island. It\u2019s a long story, but check it out at tim.blog/attia. But back to Darren. Darren Aronofsky. You can find him on Twitter and Instagram @darrenaronofsky, to say hello. He\u2019s doing some very cool stuff on Instagram, and DarrenAronofsky.com. He\u2019s the founder and head of the production company, Protozoa Pictures. He is the acclaimed and award-winning filmmaker behind cult classics like Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler, which are really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his filmography. But going back to the beginning, Pi, his first film, that was 1998, won him early plaudits and a Best Director Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Aronofsky, that\u2019s Darren, later directed and produced The Wrestler, which I absolutely loved. It made its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, which happens to be the oldest film festival in the world, where it became only the third U.S. film in history to win the esteemed Golden Lion Award. Darren later directed the indie box office phenomenon, Black Swan, which won Natalie Portman the Academy Award for Best Actress and garnered four other Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Then, his Biblically inspired epi, Noah, opened at No. 1 at the box office and grossed more than $362 million worldwide. His latest movie is mother!, a psychological horror thriller film, starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, and many others \u2013 Michelle Pfeiffer, it goes on. I\u2019ve had a chance to see this movie and I\u2019m stumbling over my words because it\u2019s hard to describe. It was mind-bending, super intense. I walked around in a dream state for an entire day after seeing this. It is unlike anything you have ever seen. So if you want to strap on your seatbelt and go on a rollercoaster, I suggest that you check it out. Without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Darren Aronofsky. Darren, sir. Welcome to the show. Darren Aronofsky: Thank you, Tim. Tim Ferriss: I have been looking forward to meeting you for some time now. Darren Aronofsky: Thank you. I\u2019m a big fan as well. Tim Ferriss: We have quite a few mutual friends. I have some suggestions, I won\u2019t mention them by name yet, as to topics and questions. I wanted to start with a question about your writing environment. Darren Aronofsky: Oh, that\u2019s a good question. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve read a little bit about a desk. A peculiar desk. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Could you describe this desk and if you still use it? Darren Aronofsky: It was interesting. I know you\u2019ve spent time in Japan. I was in Japan probably promoting, I don\u2019t know if it was Pi or Requiem for a Dream, and I went to some spa town south of Tokyo. I can\u2019t remember the name of it. I guess it was the kind of nexus of this place where they make these puzzle boxes. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen them. They\u2019re kind of beautiful, patterned, wooden boxes. You can\u2019t see any hinges or any spaces. But if you slide a few panels in a certain order, and it could be up to 8, 16, 32 moves, depending on how much money you want to spend, eventually it opens and there\u2019s a secret compartment. It blew my mind. I had never seen any type of souvenir like it. I bought a couple. I played with it for a long time. Then I think it was early days of the internet, so I started to Google a little bit about what it is. It\u2019s a whole art form. I won\u2019t try to butcher the Japanese word for it. But I then noticed that there were contests worldwide and that there was this one dude who was winning contests year after year. He was a guy in Colorado. I was like, oh, that\u2019s kind of interesting. Randomly I tracked him down and I sent him an email. His name is Kagen Sound. I sent him an email. I said, \u201cHey, did you ever think of doing any furniture?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cActually, I\u2019m working on this thing for a library.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it would interesting maybe to do a desk out of it.\u201d He loved the idea. It was amazing. He\u2019s a true master. We should probably go over to my house and check it out. Tim Ferriss: I would love to see it. Darren Aronofsky: David saw it. I don\u2019t know if he told you about it, but he freaked the hell out. Tim Ferriss: So David Blaine? Yeah, this is part of why I\u2019m asking. Darren Aronofsky: Okay, cool. Anyway, the whole thing is made completely out of wood. He doesn\u2019t work with any other materials but wood. I\u2019m not sure the count on puzzles in the desk, but there are scores of them. Eventually, they all work together to build to a final release, where basically he was able to turn it into a musical instrument. He created bellows all controlled with wood in the drawers. Actually, by pushing the drawers, it creates sounds. It has a full octave. He asked me what song I wanted. He then was able to build a computer, a thing that has switches that are all blown by the bellows and if they\u2019re done in the right order, a panel flaps open in the back with a secret drawer. It took him five years to do it and it was insane. I think the price we agreed on was a crime at the beginning. Tim Ferriss: A crime to him or a crime to you? Darren Aronofsky: A crime to him. Then I realized I didn\u2019t have a chair for it, so then I said, we should make a puzzle chair for it. I paid through the nose for that to get him back. But it\u2019s a beautiful thing and it\u2019s a great desk. Tim Ferriss: I want to say I read this in a previous interview that you\u2019ve referred to yourself as a nomadic writer. Writing in one place for a few weeks and then moving locations. How does your writing process differ project to project? How do you use the desk we were just talking about and combine that with shifting locations? I\u2019m on book deadline right now, so I\u2019m thinking about this. Of course, I\u2019ll do anything to avoid writing, including interviews. Darren Aronofsky: Exactly. I completely understand that procrastination. But my writing partner, a guy I write with a lot, Ari Handel, once said to me, probably the most important thing I taught him was that \u2013 and I didn\u2019t do this on purpose \u2013 was that procrastination is part of the process. That actually your brain needs a break every once in a while. Not to say to abuse that, but to be a little easy on yourself and allow yourself to go to a bookstore, to go to a museum. If you are serious your work, even when you\u2019re not working you are working. Your brain is putting stuff together. Inspiration comes from the strangest places, as we all know. You suddenly stumble on something that\u2019s exactly what you were looking for when you didn\u2019t know you were looking for it. But it\u2019s changed my writing process. What I used to do was a tremendous amount of prep, where we would do a tremendous amount of research and outlines and eventually get to a place where we were exhausted with that. Then I would do something called the muscle draft, where I would go and disappear somewhere. Usually far away, where I could be very alone and be very lonely. That loneliness would inspire me to work hard and fast. I would muscle out a draft. Which meant I would never go back. It was all about just pounding through it to get to the end as quick as possible. It was like a two, three-day process. You come out with \u2013 if it ended up being a 120-page screenplay, you\u2019d have a 79, 80-page screenplay. But in that muscle draft, there would be moments when you do enter that zone. I don\u2019t know if you have a term for it if you run into it. But there\u2019s that zone where you forget time. I imagine athletes are doing it. Rock musicians seem to be doing it when their eyes roll back in their head. But as a writer, every once in a while you get that where time disappears and something comes on the page. That scene is often something that ends up staying all the way through to the end of the process. Tim Ferriss: When you are muscling out that first draft, is it in \u2013 are you using screenwriting software? Is it just kind of brain vomiting bullets into a word document? What does it look like? Darren Aronofsky: I\u2019m trying to think. Final Draft has been around for a long time now and it\u2019s a great software that I\u2019ve used. I don\u2019t know if Pi was written on it. That was \u201997, so I doubt it probably. I probably was formatting stuff back then. I don\u2019t really remember. But that just helps you. It helps you work quicker because of dealing with indentation, you press tabs and shortcuts to get through it quicker. Screenwriting is very much like sculpture in the sense that if you start with a piece of clay, you don\u2019t want to just focus on the hand. Any artist that does that will tell you then the hand will be grossly detailed and enlarged compared to the rest of the body. You just want to slowly start cutting away at the clay to get closer and closer to the final form. But you don\u2019t want to get the sandpaper out until you\u2019re ready for that level of detail work. So it\u2019s just about passes. You keep going through it. Once you say, \u201cI\u2019m going to start writing,\u201d even if you get to page 30 and you think page 5 needs something, you just make a note of it and then zap to the end before you ever go back. So it\u2019s really like working slowly away at that big clay. Tim Ferriss: Do you no longer do the isolation retreats? Darren Aronofsky: I do it less and less. I mean, a funny story I was just telling my son. When I wrote Pi, my friend actually who does visual effects for me, his parents had a little cabin outside of Woodstock. I was like, \u201cHey, can I go there for a few days and pound out my muscle draft on Pi,\u201d and he was like, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I went up there. His parents were intellectuals and just had books and books and books. They were academics, so there were tons of books. I was procrastinating, looking through the books. And of course, the only book that caught my attention was Carrie, which I had never read. So I proceeded to pound through procrastinating by reading Carrie, scaring the living crap out of myself. When you read King, it\u2019s just like wow. Then I really had to write quickly because I had to get the hell out of this cabin. I think I wrote the first draft of Pi in 18 hours. But to talk about now, it\u2019s funny, this new movie, mother!, is a very different process. The most different process than I\u2019ve ever done. And probably more similar to where I started. I wrote the script in five days. It was this kind of fever dream when it happened. I had the idea two weeks before. It started off with this idea for this allegory with a real relationship drama at the core. But I didn\u2019t know how to structure it. Then I had this breakthrough of what the structure is. I had a five-day weekend without \u2013 my son was with his Mom and I was all alone. I just sat in my kitchen. I actually didn\u2019t even go up to the desk. I just pounded it out in my kitchen in my underwear, barely eating. It was just like this fever that came out of me in five days. When I was done with the script, I showed it to my producers, who didn\u2019t know I was even working on something. They were like, \u201cWow, I think there\u2019s something here.\u201d It\u2019s weird. I think I\u2019ve always been jealous of musicians. You hear the story where Bob Dylan wrote a song in the afternoon and it became the anthem for a generation. But as filmmakers, we really don\u2019t get to do that. It takes us two to five years. Black Swan, the first meeting with Natalie was ten years before I shot it. The Wrestler was eight years. The Fountain took me six years. Noah was an idea for 20 years. It\u2019s a long time. But I was like, is it possible as a filmmaker to take a single emotion and a feeling of \u2013 it\u2019s kind of what I was feeling right at that moment \u2013 and try to channel it into a single track and into a movie. I think it kind of captures a single emotion in this film. Even though it has other stuff, it really was one color that burst right through. Tim Ferriss: I want to talk something maybe related to a fever dream. The idea or the concept of, madness. I want to say, I\u2019m certainly paraphrasing, but that maybe you\u2019ve said that by walking the tightrope between sanity and insanity, you can learn what sanity is. Or something along those lines. Do you have a fascination with madness? Why do people have that perception? Darren Aronofsky: I had an uncle who was schizophrenic. So I grew up around that. I got to see it very close. I sort of saw his mindset and also how it weighed on my family. The emotional ripples from that were tremendous. Then I also saw how society treated people like that. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been very close to and I\u2019ve always thought about it. I remember reading \u2013 what was it? The Denial of Death? Did you ever read that book? Tim Ferriss: No. Darren Aronofsky: That\u2019s a good one for you. But they talk about the liminal, the line, the thin line between the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Conscious and subliminal. Darren Aronofsky: Or, I think how they were using between genius and insanity. There were things that my uncle would say. He was a highly functioning guy. He worked as an engineer for New York City for his entire life and had a pension and all that. Made it through, but lived a very tough life because of the illness. He would say things that were just unbelievably brilliant. I remember one time, my Dad was talking to him about how to do something. I don\u2019t remember exactly the details. He said \u2013 well, I can\u2019t really say this on radio, right? Tim Ferriss: Oh, you can say what you want. You can. Darren Aronofsky: He said something like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s like if you fuck a snake, you get an elephant.\u201d I remember hearing it. I was 12 or 13. But that\u2019s kind of a crazy metaphor and kind of beautiful and it\u2019s so extreme. It was like the best way of saying yeah, right. Like you\u2019re selling me the Brooklyn Bridge. But he had many of those that were just sort of like, that\u2019s not proper English, but it kind of works. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve always had an absolute fascination with that very thin line. When I was an undergrad \u2013 I\u2019m not a mathematician. In fact, part of the reason I went to Princeton is that, at the time of least, did not have a math requirement. I was scared off of math by a very belligerent teacher in tenth grade. Darren Aronofsky: Oh, that sucks. Tim Ferriss: It was terrible My brother, in fact, same grade, different teacher, was steered in the opposite direction and is finishing a Ph.D. in statistics. Darren Aronofsky: That shows you what teachers can do. Tim Ferriss: But I was drawn to a few, specifically, mathematicians at Princeton, who were really riding that razor\u2019s edge and had multiple suicide attempts, but were all brilliant beyond all description. I personally, and in fact, I also have a cousin who\u2019s schizophrenic, which was relatively later onset, and became effectively a different person. Still very smart. Have you ever worried that you would bleed over that edge? Darren Aronofsky: Luckily, my hubris doesn\u2019t go that far where I get that worried. I\u2019m not a crazy hypochondriac, but yeah, sure, when I was a \u2013 I think when I was a teenager and I read somewhere that schizophrenia\u2019s onset can happen in your 20s. That idea that when you\u2019re a fully formed human being, suddenly things can change for you. That was a scary idea. Will it happen for me? I definitely think when it came to perhaps exploring plant enhancements, I was always a little terrified that I might go too far in a certain direction. It\u2019s always been in the back of my head a little bit, just because, you know, a lot of that stuff is genetic. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really haunting me. But I guess maybe a little bit you thought of maybe the possibility, the fear of it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, well, I almost offed myself in college. I went through a very dark period that I actually talked about really publicly in a major way for the first time on stage at Ted, which really shut the room down. Darren Aronofsky: Good for you. I think it\u2019s important. Tim Ferriss: But that is always or has always been in the back of my mind. One of the things that I got from \u2013 as you put it, place enhancements \u2013 or psychedelic experience was temporarily experiencing what could only be, it would have to be on some level synonymous with extreme mental illness. Darren Aronofsky: Definitely. There\u2019s a neural connection. Tim Ferriss: And developing more empathy as a result, living in a place like San Francisco, where you\u2019re just surrounded by people who homeless and mentally ill. One of the topics I had down to talk about was psychedelics, which was suggested by someone we both know who will remain nameless for now. Darren Aronofsky: I want to know who that was. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 how he feels. There are only three. But what role has that played in your life? How do you think about it as fitting into your life? Darren Aronofsky: Look, I\u2019ve researched it, read a lot about it. I think it\u2019s very interesting. The story of deer in Siberia that eat mushrooms and fall over and it doesn\u2019t seem there\u2019s any \u2013 survival of the fittest, evolutionary positivity for a deer to make itself that helpless. So maybe there is something else going on. Some other medicine or something else that this creature is getting out of putting itself at risk was just a fascinating idea. The fact that shamanism and reaching alternative states has been part of our culture for a super long time and then somehow got completely washed out. I don\u2019t know, turned into the sacrament, maybe rock and roll music. But we really lost anything that sort of trying to reach away from scientific reality is clearly a loss. It seems like there\u2019s a lot of wisdom to come out of some exploration in a safe type of example, as long as it\u2019s very controlled environments. There\u2019s clearly tremendous benefit that\u2019s happened for society that\u2019s recently been discovered and is being rediscovered right now. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m involved with some research at Johns Hopkins and a few other places related to the use of psilocybin specifically in potentially addressing treatment-resistant depression, among other things. Darren Aronofsky: That\u2019s what\u2019s fascinating out of all that stuff that MAPS is doing with PTSD and the fact that the Defense Department is supporting it because it seems to be working. I just saw a film that came out of Israel that is using MDMA to sort of help people deal \u2013 not just soldiers \u2013 but people deal with all different types of emotional distress. It\u2019s fascinating and it\u2019s interesting and it\u2019s clearly \u2013 if the Defense Department is supporting it, then it\u2019s probably pretty interesting to them. Tim Ferriss: I think it\u2019s also a really smart place for research to start. Or one at least to the subsets of the population that\u2019s very smart to work with is returning vets. Specifically, among other reasons, because it is a nonpartisan issue. It\u2019s very hard to be like, \u201cFuck the vets.\u201d Or \u201cScrew the terminal cancer patients who want to decrease end-of-life anxiety.\u201d Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s funny though because another thing I\u2019m involved with is I\u2019m on the Board of Directors for The Sierra Club. A big part of what Sierra Club is trying to do is get vets into nature. We have all these different programs that do that. In fact, I actually went to the Arctic with two vets. It was amazing for them \u2013 not just to have that experience, which is completely mind-expansive to see nature in a true \u2013 see true wilderness, like what\u2019s happening in the Arctic. But I think to a lot of them, what they expressed to me is this is what they were fighting for. To defend this and their spirit. So they actually get to see the beauty of America outside of the cities that they\u2019re from. Tim Ferriss: I want to continue to talk for a little bit about really old traditions. What we\u2019re talking about, or at least some of these traditions have existed for millennia. Fasting is another one. Have you done experiments with fasting? Darren Aronofsky: A little bit. It\u2019s something I definitely want to get more into. I\u2019ve been totally into the idea for a long time. Of course, I fast once a year. Not that I\u2019m religious, but because I like the spiritual practice of fasting once a year with my buddies. So I get together with my friends and fast for that one day. But a long-term fasting I think is fascinating. I\u2019ve heard great stories about it, but I haven\u2019t actually had \u2013 it\u2019s amazing how little that goes on in our privileged lives and how that\u2019s just a very interesting practice. Tim Ferriss: What is interesting about it to you? Because I try to do it, for instance, I try to do \u2013 and note to people listening \u2013 I\u2019m not a doctor. I don\u2019t play one on the internet. Don\u2019t be stupid. Talk to a qualified medical professional, blah, blah, blah. I tend to do at least three days of consecutive fasting per month and then I do longer fasts a few times per year. Darren Aronofsky: Wow. You do just water? Tim Ferriss: I will make some allowances. I do it differently at different times. What I will sometimes do is use fasting as a way to kickstart ketosis. So clicking over into ketosis. Certainly, our friend, Peter Attia, knows a lot about it. He was in ketosis for about two and a half years straight. But fasting for a period of time what I will allow if I\u2019m doing a longer fast, in particular, is I will allow myself non-caloric drinks that are unsweetened. So let\u2019s say black tea, black coffee. Darren Aronofsky: And KitKat bars. Tim Ferriss: And KitKat bars. Only zero-calorie KitKat bars. I will also, particularly in the beginning, allow myself some exogenous ketones. They\u2019re just supplemental ketones. Or fat like coconut oil, to help with the transition. Darren Aronofsky: That\u2019s great. Tim Ferriss: But besides that, nix. Darren Aronofsky: Then the pain is after two, three days, right, it\u2019s supposed to ease off? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for most men \u2013 women can sometimes take a little longer to click over. For most men, about two to three days and then you can click over. Darren Aronofsky: All right, well, let\u2019s do it. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m in. What interests you about fasting? Darren Aronofsky: Once again, it\u2019s clearly a way to explore other spaces. I immediately \u2013 for me, if I\u2019ve got a difficult meeting where I have to be a jerk because something is not getting done correctly. If I skip breakfast and do it close to when lunch is, I get stuff done. So in my own way, I do micro fasting to control my mood. Knowing that some of that anxiety and anger will disappear as soon as I eat. So it\u2019s sometimes a good thing to motivate me to help with the work in certain ways. I do my own mood enhancement. For a long time, I was dating someone and we used to get at each other and then finally, someone turned me on to the word \u201changry,\u201d which I think is probably pretty common now, but at the time, it was a pretty new word. It kind of changed my relationship and kept the relationship going for the next three or four years because we could actually identify why we both became assholes for a little bit. So clearly it\u2019s a major mood blocker and changer and alternator and all that stuff. I think that\u2019s interesting. Then I\u2019ve heard and read all about the health benefits of it. Then, of course, there are all the meditative elements of it. The control, the mind over the body. David Blaine is always demonstrating going to some serious extremes. But I think there are lessons to be learned and experiences to be had during it. Tim Ferriss: This is sort of the nature of my fragmented mind that we\u2019re going to jump around a lot. You mentioned difficult conversations or where you have to be an asshole. I had read about, while very much in passing, you had a conversation with Mickey Rourke before filming. Darren Aronofsky: Well, Mickey\u2019s version \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Well, no, so I actually don\u2019t have a whole lot of context, but roughly that you knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy and that he had a lot of strong opinions. So you had an honest, upfront conversation. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: I would love to hear how you open a conversation like that or plan for it. Darren Aronofsky: Mickey, at the time, had an awful reputation. I think that\u2019s because he \u2013 I think in many ways, he was his worst enemy because he loved acting, but he also loved boxing. He had this fight and struggle between him which one he was going to focus on. I think he really respected the box. Anyway, whatever happened to him, everyone was warning me about it, everyone. But I love him. I loved his work. Before I knew him, I thought his work was exceptional. I felt it was a crime on the acting arts that he did not have more opportunities to share himself with the world because whenever he has shared himself, it was unbelievable. From Barfly to Angel Heart, to all of that beautiful, early work he did. Then it just sort of disappeared. But I just wanted to be very clear with him because I felt I just knew how challenging the film we were about to do was going to be. I find that the longer I do this, the more clear you can be up front, the better. No matter what happens, it always changes. I think people sometimes don\u2019t really hear what you\u2019re saying to them a lot because they really want to do something. So I try to be very straightforward and clear because I want to get as many of the problems off the table because when we do get to set, time is really the biggest enemy or foe because it\u2019s so short and it happens so quickly that if you start getting into stupid things that weren\u2019t pre-discussed, it\u2019s a nightmare. So you have to be as completely prepared and professional as you can when you\u2019re spending whatever it is \u2013 $20,000 a minute or whatever it may be that day. Mike Tyson money time is what I\u2019m talking about. You want to be on top of your game. I just went in very clearly with Mickey. I think what it meant for Mickey for it is he looked at me like medicine. It tasted really bad, but he knew it was good for him. So he just closed his eyes, opened his mouth and swallowed to get it done and really to keep \u2013 because I think he knew deep in his heart that what I was trying to do was make a great film with him. Then he rose to it and brought it. He talks about that meeting like the little, skinny punk coming to him and pointing his little stubby finger in his face \u2013 which I love. It\u2019s funny. I wish I was that tough and that straightforward. I\u2019m sure I was more cordial and polite to him because I was, I know I was in awe of him and excited to meet him. But I just wanted to be clear that look, if we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re going to do this. Let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and go for it. Because for me, filmmaking is so hard. I think for a lot of people, there are just so many challenges. Literally, every single film I\u2019ve done has been like its own IPO. It\u2019s own corporation. I start off with an idea. I have to attract talent and money to come together. Yes, there\u2019s a formula but I generally am making things that don\u2019t quite fit into the widget factory. They\u2019re a little weird and stuff. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I don\u2019t think they fit in the widget factory. Darren Aronofsky: So I have to convince people why it\u2019s going to be a widget. Then we have to raise the money and hopefully make it and get the investors\u2019 money back. I\u2019m 5 for 6, which isn\u2019t bad. But each time, it\u2019s a real, it\u2019s a lot of work. You want to make the whole process of it, for all the artists working with you, as easy as possible. That\u2019s not really where you want to put your fighting. You want to do your fighting for the world and the money and all that. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re making a new film. You\u2019re working with someone who you respect, just to depersonalize it a little bit. Although, you could give a real example. Let\u2019s say like Mickey, someone you really admire, who has a reputation for being very strong-willed and you\u2019re going to have this conversation again. How do you open it? What are some of the phrases that you use to prevent it from blowing up or to try to allow it to go well? Darren Aronofsky: I\u2019ve never done a situation where I\u2019m asking someone, hey, we\u2019re going to waterboard you for three months. I mean, we\u2019re trying to do something that\u2019s exciting and hopefully beautiful and striving to make art. So that\u2019s the underlying agreement. You\u2019re walking into that conversation. Hey, I dig you, you dig me, let\u2019s try to make this work. But just to be clear, these are some of the things that are going to be going on that will probably make you feel uncomfortable. Tim Ferriss: What would be some examples of those? Darren Aronofsky: A very clear example would be when working with women (or men) if there are things that are sexual in nature \u2013 what\u2019s required nudity-wise and all that type of stuff. You have to talk about that beforehand because, of course, it\u2019s very sensitive material. You want everyone to be comfortable and very clear on why you\u2019re doing something. Anytime you do a lovemaking scene, what exactly is it going to be and why? I\u2019ve never really don\u2019t a lovemaking scene to make it an erotic thing for an audience. I always try to tie it in narratively. So I tell them very clearly where the camera is going to be, what we\u2019re going to do, how we\u2019re going to run the set, stuff like that. The same thing with violence. Violence, I think, is just as important in the other way of how we\u2019re going to be demonstrating violence, how we\u2019re going to show it. For me, that\u2019s a huge pet peeve. Because I feel in this country, sexuality and violence have flipped, especially in the movies. Where you can have as much violence as you want in a PG, PG-13 movie, but you can\u2019t have an ounce of sexuality in a PG or PG-13 movie. That, to me, is disgusting. I don\u2019t have words to go beyond that. The fact that we\u2019re training our kids to fire guns at such a young age, with Nerf guns and video games, it\u2019s disgusting and disturbing while any form of saying there\u2019s a beauty in the human physical connection that no, we can\u2019t talk about that. The fact that the MPAA sort of reinforces that. I\u2019ll go off, but like guns in ads. I\u2019ll walk down the street \u2013 when my kid was 5, 6 years old and my kid\u2019s pointing at huge, crazy, sexy-looking machine guns on the biggest movie stars in the world. It\u2019s disgusting. The gun companies are getting free ads. Yet, you can\u2019t show someone kissing. There\u2019s a whole sort of bend with that. I don\u2019t know how I got there, but I got there. I\u2019m sorry. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t know how I get to where I go half the time. I want to talk a little bit about the word, \u201ccatharsis.\u201d I recently saw your new film. I really enjoyed the experience and came away \u2013 I told you this \u2013 for a full day afterward was in this dreamlike state. Darren Aronofsky: Wonderful. Tim Ferriss: Which I savored. I had a lot of questions. Sometimes I feel like we \u2013 actually, I think Milan Kundera I think said that the stupidity of man is that he has all the answers and the intelligence or beauty of a novel is that it\u2019s a question for everything. Something like that. Darren Aronofsky: That\u2019s interesting. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m paraphrasing. This is in his Book of Laughter and Forgetting. At one point, I recall reading that you didn\u2019t intend people to find catharsis in your movies. They expect to have happy endings and so on, but perhaps the catharsis comes the day after seeing the film. What do you want the experience of your audience to be? What do you want them to take away from any one of your films? You could give a concrete example or in general something that drives you. Darren Aronofsky: Well, I guess I start off with the first rule of filmmaking is never to bore an audience. That, to me, is the worst feeling and experience when I\u2019m watching a movie and my mind is wandering and maybe looking at the color splatter across the screen. I think you always want to engage an audience. Not just visually, not just through sound, but emotionally. I think that\u2019s rule one is to just to give people an engaging, memorial experience for two hours, whatever you\u2019re running time is. Then I think, on top of that you can hopefully layer in some ideas so that when people leave the theater, it\u2019s not like 15 minutes later, what did we watch? I don\u2019t want to be the McDonald\u2019s of movies, where just the wrapper is all that\u2019s left over. I want people to be thinking a bit about it and talking about it. For me, one of my best life experiences was just randomly I walked into a coffee shop. It happened to be around the corner from where Pi was playing at the New Art. A dad came in with his 18-year-old daughter and two of her friends. The four of them were sitting there, just talking about this black-and-white movie that they had just seen. I just eavesdropped; listening to them, just thrilled that there were a conversation and a debate. What did that mean? And what did that mean? For me, that\u2019s always been \u2013 the films I love, yes, there are movies that you have a great experience in and enjoy and it\u2019s just a great pleasure to watch and a great experience. But I also like the ones that make you scratch your head and you think about and you talk and you debate. Because you want to have an impact. I think in today\u2019s landscape, a lot of things are disposable and it\u2019s really quick how disposable they are because of how much stuff we\u2019re being bombarded with day after day after day. It\u2019s nice to hopefully have something that reflects back on it and thinks about it. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned emotion. I think you had said emotional connection or engagement. What are some of the ingredients that help to create that? Because most films fail. I think anyway. Darren Aronofsky: It starts with what I think is the greatest invention of the 20th century, which is overlooked, which is the close-up. That\u2019s the great thing about cinema is the fact that you can stick a camera right in the face of Paul Newman, right in those beautiful blue eyes. You can go right into his soul. Then when you project it months later to an audience or years later, potentially centuries later, you are anonymous in that audience, yet you can feel the empathy. Because, in reality, two people talking and hanging out, how much eye contact do you make? There are lots of other things going on in this room that you\u2019re taking in. That air conditioning rattling. My guys mixing in the other room. But the actual connection with another human being, where you\u2019re really looking into their soul and not thinking about yourself. Because the thing is when I look at you and you look at me, we\u2019re thinking a little bit about wow, now I\u2019m making us uncomfortable looking at each other and we\u2019re going to be looking away. But in a movie and via the close-up, you can be unconscious and fully be in Paul Newman\u2019s head, even though you don\u2019t exactly what he\u2019s thinking, you can study him and steal that thought. That to me is the greatness of cinema or one of the great things about cinema. That\u2019s where you get the emotion. What happens is if you start linking different emotions together, hopefully, you start to tell a story. What the story does is it expands the emotion. Just like a joke \u2013 set up, set up, set up, payoff. That\u2019s the classic structure of a joke. It\u2019s the same thing with drama, where you\u2019re setting up a character and building character. You give him a challenge and then you see them go through that challenge and payoff. Then there\u2019s always the pitfall when it all falls apart and then they rise up. That hero\u2019s journey is just so \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s genetic. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s part of the human condition. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something that we\u2019re taught very young in our first Dr. Seuss books. But it\u2019s something that we all around the planet in every language, in every culture, can relate to. For me, the power storytelling happened \u2013 I graduated high school early and backpacked around Europe and the Middle East. I ended up in the Gemma in Marrakech. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been there. Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t. Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s an amazing in the middle of the Souk, where they have all the shops and stuff. At nighttime, it\u2019s filled with snake charmers and food and all this stuff. There was this one old guy, leaning on a cane in a beard, telling a story. He had a huge crowd around him. It was all in Arabic and I didn\u2019t understand a freaking word, but I was mesmerized. I was like, that\u2019s what I want to do. I want to tell stories. Because that little, old, shriveled guy on a cane was transforming himself into this 20-foot beast and I didn\u2019t even understand the language. I was like, that\u2019s cool, to entertain a crowd with a point of view. Tim Ferriss: Where was that experience relative to your time in Kenya? Darren Aronofsky: That was after Kenya. I\u2019m also on the Board of Directors for an organization called The School for Field Studies, which is a great organization out of Salem, Massachusetts, which basically trains mostly college students to go abroad and into sensitive environmental areas and do environmental studies. When I was a young teenager, I worked at the New York City Aquarium in Coney Island, which was right next to my neighborhood in Brooklyn. One of the big perks of that job, besides being at the Aquarium, was that if you wore the Aquarium t-shirt, you got to go on the Cyclone rollercoaster over and over again. So we used to go 40, 50 times in a row on the Cyclone. But I picked up a book for The School for Field Studies there. It was just this little color catalog. I was like wow, they sent kids to Kenya and I was like, \u201cMa, this is what I want to do. Dad.\u201d Somehow they took a few high school students. I was in advanced biology, so I had a little bit \u2013 I was always good in science. My Dad was a science teacher, so I was always pointed in that direction a bit. I got them to let me go to Kenya, where I studied water strategies and ungulates. The next year, I went to Alaska with them to Prince William Sound, actually where that big Exxon spill was, but I was there two years before that. Which was fascinating because the research we did there actually they used that research after the spill to see what the impact was. But in Alaska, I studied thermal regulation in harbor seals. I just like to say these words because they\u2019re fancy sounding. Tim Ferriss: Ungulates. Darren Aronofsky: Ungulates. Tim Ferriss: Tell us what would fall into the class of ungulates. Darren Aronofsky: All animals that stand on their hooves. So everything from cattle, domesticated cattle, to zebra, gazelle, wildebeest. Tim Ferriss: Deer and elk. Darren Aronofsky: There were no deer or elk. There might have been some type of elk there. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. I guess there would be caribou in Alaska. Darren Aronofsky: It was interesting. We basically were there. We were on this ranch owned by an Afrikaner who wanted to \u2013 he did this thing called preservation for profit. Where basically he was like, \u201cLook, during a drought, all the cattle die, but indigenous animals, of course, don\u2019t die because they basically forage in the morning when there\u2019s dew on the leaves and in the mid-afternoon, they\u2019re in the shade. Basically what we were there to do is to prove his idea that indigenous animals were better adapted to the environment than domesticated animals, which is completely obvious, but in science, you have to prove it. So we studied them morphologically, which was biologically, and then we also looked at them and their behavior patterns during the day. It was fascinating because basically we just use \u2013 I learned the scientific method and we did real, serious research and real charting. The next year was Alaska when I went to Prince William Sound. The beauty of that was the textbook. The only textbook we had was Origin of Species. Every two days, we had to read another chapter of Origin of Species and discuss it. Over the six, seven weeks I was out in the bush, that was the whole class. Tim Ferriss: I had read that your time \u2013 this was acting as a field biologist or doing field biology in Kenya changed how you looked at the word. I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s accurate or not. But if that is true, how did it change how you looked at things? Darren Aronofsky: Everything in your life changes all the time. But back at that age, when you\u2019re 16 and you\u2019re a Brooklyn kid from New York City who\u2019s basically a concrete jungle flea and you\u2019re suddenly in the savannah of Kenya, of course, it\u2019s going to change your life. It\u2019s a little bit of an overstatement, I think. But every day was mind-blowing. As an embarrassing moment \u2013 when I was 16, so you have to forgive me \u2013 I got off the plane and I was riding with the professors to the thing. I was like, \u201cOh, when are we going to see tigers?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any tigers in Africa, they\u2019re in Asia.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh.\u201d So that\u2019s what I meant. So I was a kid from Brooklyn with no idea what was going on. Every day literally was something I had never seen before. Then in Alaska \u2013 this is a pre-Google, pre-crazy media age, still only 11 channels on the station. A couple of people had cable. But early days of civilization. I remember we were kayaking. It was an amazing trip. It was five weeks in kayaks out in Prince William Sound, one of the most untouched places on the planet, at that point, until Exxon showed up. We were going to this glacier. I had never seen a glacier. Now everyone\u2019s seen a glacier at this point because of the calving ice and what\u2019s happening to the glaciers. But the idea of blue ice, for a kid from Brooklyn? This Chineka Glacier, the first time I saw it, it was two miles long, half a mile tall. There were huge chunks of ice falling. You\u2019d see the chunks fall off and then a minute later you\u2019d hear the sound because of the distance like at a ballpark. Then these huge waves from that start coming at you. You\u2019re in a kayak so you\u2019re really close to the water. On those waves are icebergs with seals hauled out, regulating their temperature on it, going up and down. I mean, who needs psychedelics? Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve been called controversial. I don\u2019t know if you view yourself that way. But I\u2019d love to talk a little bit about how to respond to public perception and criticism. Another mutual friend of ours, Rick Rubin, fantastic guy, incredible music producer, among other things. Darren Aronofsky: The greatest. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. He has said on this podcast, I\u2019m paraphrasing, but \u201cThe best art divides the audience.\u201d I think it was \u2013 help me out here \u2013 I think it was Variety, the day after you got a 30-minute standing ovation and said you should quit filmmaking and go to therapy instead. you\u2019ve had, as anybody who is in the public arena has, a fair amount of criticism of various types. What would your advice be to a filmmaker you think is very promising who is doing something that doesn\u2019t fit cleanly in the widget factory. They\u2019re probably going to catch fire, but they haven\u2019t had the experience. What would you say to a person like that? Darren Aronofsky: That\u2019s an easy answer. Keep going. That\u2019s what you want. When I meet, when I teach \u2013 both my parents were teachers and so it\u2019s in the blood and I love teaching \u2013 the thing I try to instill in students is the only thing you have to offer is you, your individual stories, your individual perception, your individual humanity. Figuring out a way to communicate that humanity to humanity at large. That\u2019s the beauty of cinema, once again. That you can have a 6-year-old Iranian girl or a 90-year-old British gentleman and you can have an equally emotional experience if the filmmaker does their job right to it. For me, it would be a ballerina and a wrestler. Can I make you feel their blood and their pain? That\u2019s the goal. Because that\u2019s one of the great thing cinema does is to bring us into other human experiences. If it\u2019s truthful to who you are and you\u2019re concerned about how people are going to react to it, stick up your middle finger and charge straight into that fire if you have to. If you\u2019re trying to be a provocateur just to be a provocateur, go after yourself. That, to me, is the bad stuff. Like when it\u2019s not real. For me, it\u2019s never like, oh shit, how do I mess around with people? That\u2019s not why I make movies at all. I\u2019m just juiced about these ideas. They have nothing about being confrontational. But even when I do a film like The Fountain \u2013 which has been called a love poem to death \u2013 I piss people off. Even though it\u2019s really a gentle, romantic movie about a guy coming to terms with dying. I guess that\u2019s just not a very commercial idea in the west. But I thought it was at the time. I was dancing around for five years, telling studios that people would be interested in the movie because I really believed it. I\u2019m not interested. I happen to be a filmmaker who wants to talk to audiences. I love it. I love when they respond. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t done a comedy or something that\u2019s easier to connect with an audience. Not easier to make, by any means. I just mean when you\u2019re aiming to please an audience, it\u2019s a lot easier to make it than when you\u2019re just making something that you feel inside. For me, it\u2019s not a conscious thing. It\u2019s purely from my gut. That\u2019s the core for me. It comes from my stomach, always. It\u2019s not the heart. It might be somewhere between. I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s right here? Tim Ferriss: Solar plexus? Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s right beneath the solar plexus. It\u2019s kind of the stomach, I guess. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like your large intestine? Darren Aronofsky: Oh, great. [Crosstalk] Darren Aronofsky: \u2013 it\u2019s that area. When I\u2019m writing and it\u2019s coming out of there, I know it\u2019s some time of qi energy from there. Tim Ferriss: Do you pay a lot of attention to your kinesthetic response to what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re writing? Darren Aronofsky: I mean, it\u2019s that unconscious state where you\u2019re not feeling the body. That\u2019s the state to get into. Where it\u2019s just coming out of you. By no means is that often. I believe there are writers out there \u2013 I know some real writers and I think they get into that state a lot easier. I\u2019m not a real writer, but sometimes I have ideas that I want to get out and express, so I try to do it. Tim Ferriss: Why did you say you\u2019re not a real writer? There are people who would argue if you have writing credits, that you are a writer. Darren Aronofsky: Right. I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m in awe of \u2013 I have some friends that really write and I see the way they can put words together. Look, the reality \u2013 I\u2019m being more truthful with Ferriss than I\u2019ve been with probably anyone \u2013 the reality is I was a public school kid from Brooklyn and they never really taught me how to write. When I got to college, I went into the creative writing class and I almost flunked out of it because I really did not know how to write an essay. To this day, my 11-year-old son knows more about pronouns and nouns and sentence structure. I just never learned grammar. It was never taught to me. It was a shame. I just never did the remedial. So I probably have some type of insecurity about that because I don\u2019t think I could write that. I can write dialogue because I have an ear and I do have some ideas that I can try to sketch out, but I don\u2019t really \u2013 I guess I\u2019m scared you\u2019re going to give me an essay to write because that\u2019s going to be a challenging one. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to be the last person to give you an essay to write. My writing of my senior thesis in college, which was mandatory, and it constitutes a huge part of your departmental grade for the entire time that you\u2019re at school, traumatized me so much that I pledged to myself when I graduated I would never write anything longer than an email ever again. Clearly, it did not work out. It worked out, but it didn\u2019t work out as planned. Darren Aronofsky: What was your thesis on? Tim Ferriss: My thesis was on the phonetic and semantic acquisition of Chinese characters in the Japanese language, called kanji, by native English speakers. So how do native English speakers most effectively acquire both the meaning and pronunciation of Chinese characters? Darren Aronofsky: Unbelievable. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. In retrospect. Darren Aronofsky: It doesn\u2019t seem like someone who\u2019s afraid of writing would write something like that. That\u2019s pretty \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You know, a lot of my true interests were buried in some of these early writing projects, or even scientific assignments that I then felt were trivial or not serious for some reason and now I\u2019m coming back to them 20 years later. Darren Aronofsky: Amazing. Tim Ferriss: I remember I took a neuroscience class. Initially, the plan was to be a neuroscience major. I actually was a psychology major focusing on neuroscience. For a host of reasons, I moved to language acquisition, namely, principally I couldn\u2019t do the animal testing that was required to be part of the lab I wanted to be part of. Darren Aronofsky: Good for you. Tim Ferriss: I will say I understand the sensitivity of the subject. I do think some studies are very difficult to do or impossible to do without certain animal modeling. Darren Aronofsky: I\u2019ve been deep into this. Tim Ferriss: No, I know you are. [Crosstalk] Darren Aronofsky: No, not for environmental reasons. I have \u2013 well, we\u2019ll talk about it later. Tim Ferriss: No, we can definitely talk about it. I was really fascinated by REM sleep and some of the physiological similarities to states that can be induced with hallucinogens. So this was probably my sophomore year in college that I was really fascinated by this. It only took 25 years to come back to it full circle. Darren Aronofsky: Did you ever try to stay awake for a long time? Tim Ferriss: I stayed awake \u2013 and this is not advisable at all \u2013 I wanted to \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: I love the disclaimer. Tim Ferriss: Well, because every once in a while I\u2019ll get an email from somebody, like \u201cMy cousin tried what you said and he gave himself a headache.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, you got to use your common sense, people.\u201d I stayed awake for six days. I wanted to see what would happen. I had read these reports of people having all sorts of odd phenomena crop up when you stay awake for that period of time. I used stimulants, nothing illegal. But I was very going at putting together these cocktails for myself and stayed awake for five and a half, six days. I stopped because I was walking on campus \u2013 I remember very clearly where I was. I was \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: And you were naked. Tim Ferriss: No, I wasn\u2019t naked. There were goblins everywhere. No, I fell asleep while I was walking and woke up about a block later. I had crossed two or three streets. I was like, you know what? This is no longer a good idea. Have you stayed awake for a really long period of time? Darren Aronofsky: No. There was a test when I was an undergrad and my roommate did it where he basically, to stay awake. He just became cruel. I remember him telling me. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to sleep.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep.\u201d He took a deck of cards and started throwing cards around the room and made everyone run around and pick them up; otherwise, he would go to sleep. So he started really messing with the aides and the grad students that were doing the studies on him. Of course, the overnighter and those are important, not just when you\u2019re in college and stuff. I\u2019m glad you are out there exploring it for us. Tim Ferriss: The conclusion is, don\u2019t do that. If you remove sleep and food from people, they get really grumpy, it turns out. This is a quote from New York Magazine. This may have been from a while ago. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that old, actually. \u201cI think when I was starting out as a filmmaker, I had tremendous focus, but I don\u2019t think I robbed myself of too much life. I\u2019m still friends with the guys I grew up with nursery school. I have a great relationship with my family. I\u2019m definitely attracted to balance to symmetry. I\u2019m definitely an order personality, but I\u2019m a lot less ordered than I was.\u201d Darren Aronofsky: God damn, I said some stupid shit. Tim Ferriss: You can definitely deny. You can correct. You can set the record straight. Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s all right. Tim Ferriss: This is of incredible interest to me because many people who would aspire to be creative or who self-describe as creative, wear themselves out. They sacrifice family, relationships by being singularly focused. Sometimes they\u2019re proud of it; sometimes they regret it. But this is something that I don\u2019t hear very often. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that. How do you have the tremendous focus required to do what you\u2019ve done while still having that balance and symmetry? Darren Aronofsky: It is a balancing act. But I think all the time you put into life, into family and into friends, and into activities outside of the work, back to I\u2019ll procrastinate \u2013 not to say time with your family is procrastination \u2013 but bringing in those other experiences into your life is what makes you be able to relate to people and to communicate. At least, for filmmaking, that\u2019s a major part. Going to a diner with friends and seeing an argument between some strangers over there ends up in a movie for me. Living life and seeing stuff and doing all different types of experiences through this planet is important to being a storyteller because it\u2019s all about the stories. I think the first three or four films of my career and definitely all my short films before that, all came out of very personal experiences of my life. The problem is if you keep working nonstop and you\u2019re originating your material \u2013 I think it\u2019s different if you\u2019re more of a journeyman who\u2019s going along and then just taking your craft and bringing it to life, bringing a great script to life. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that, \u201cas a journeyman?\u201d Darren Aronofsky: Something that\u2019s not a personal story by nature. I think every story is personal or you can find a personal way because anytime you portray a character on screen, you should sort of infuse them with real emotions and stuff. To do that, you have to feel it yourself. But if you\u2019re drawing on your own life and your own stories and you\u2019re somehow more autobiographical somehow, even through metaphor. I think all my films are not \u2013 I\u2019m not a ballerina, yet there\u2019s a lot of Natalie in me. I mean, that character, Nina, in me. Not Natalie, but Nina, the character. I\u2019m not a wrestler, but Randy the Ram I\u2019m pretty connected to and I understand why he makes every decision. Some of those stories in there I can relate to or are drawn from my own life. I think if it\u2019s an assignment where you\u2019re just showing up as a director and you\u2019re there to make all the departments work together and make the actors do it, I think it becomes more of a craft then. Not to say that it\u2019s not an art, but I think if you\u2019re trying to create your own stories that are coming out of life, you have to actually live life to do it. Otherwise, you\u2019re just getting your stories \u2013 I don\u2019t know where you could get your stories from. I guess you could make things about being an obsessive filmmaker. Which is kind of like one of my favorite filmmakers, Fellini started making films about directors making films. [Crosstalk] Darren Aronofsky: Eventually he went off into other things, but for a while, that\u2019s what he worked on. I think you have to balance it in this art form. It\u2019s very different, I think, in different forms because other forms can be expressed in different ways. I can\u2019t really speak to that, but storytelling, you need stories. Tim Ferriss: It reminds me of something I was told at one point, which helped me at least, which was a friend of mine, a writer, I think it was either Debbie Millman or Maria Popova. They said, \u201cIf art imitates life, you have to have a life.\u201d I guess my follow-up question is, when you are really immersed in a project, and maybe now with family and so on it\u2019s different than in the early days, but my experience and part of the risk I have when I go into a project is that it tends to crowd out other things. Do you schedule time with friends and family so that they don\u2019t get displaced? How do you ensure that happens? Or are you just programmed in such a way that it\u2019s natural? It\u2019s not a bad life as a filmmaker because basically, at least the way my schedule is, I do a film every two, three years. In that two, three years, there will be like a 50, 60-day run which will be completely selfish and completely committed and dedicated to the film, where I\u2019m working 18, 20-hour days over and over again. An insane amount of time. You get one day off on the weekend and then the next day you\u2019re probably prepping. Although I\u2019m able now to almost get two days off because I\u2019ve been doing it enough that I kind of have more skills that I can go in. So I can get a weekend off sometimes where I can spend with family and friends. Not that I could go out and party and have a beer. It\u2019s got to be very mellow. Most of the time, I\u2019ll just want to watch Game of Thrones. But that\u2019s a huge marathon that only happens once every two, three years. Then you get into editing and it\u2019s basically a 9:00 to 5:00 job. There\u2019s always things coming up, but it\u2019s a much slower pace. That could be a 40-week process. Then you get to selling the film, which is kind of a two, three week kind of marathon of travel, but it\u2019s kind of fun because that\u2019s where a lot of stories come from because you see all these different cultures and you just see a lot of crazy shit. It\u2019s not that bad. Then I get into development. When I\u2019m in development for the next project, once again, I can really shape that around my son\u2019s schedule and I can have time to see my friends and have experiences and travel and stuff like that. Because when you\u2019re developing, it\u2019s all virtual in your head. Not quite in a computer, but it\u2019s all in your imagination for a while. All you need is a notepad and a pen and you could be anywhere. Tim Ferriss: Are there any particular resources \u2013 and I\u2019m sure this is a question you\u2019ve had a lot, so I apologize in advance, but I haven\u2019t heard the answer \u2013 to aspiring filmmakers? Let\u2019s just assume intelligent, driven, organized. So a big assumption, but let\u2019s just assume they check those three boxes. Darren Aronofsky: Sure. Tim Ferriss: Are there any particular books or resources or approaches that you would suggest they take? Assuming that they want to put together some type of narrative storytelling, not doing a documentary. Darren Aronofsky: I always push The Writer\u2019s Journey by Christopher Vogler. It\u2019s very good. But it\u2019s only for people who are writing screenplays. But he\u2019s great. He basically took Joseph Campbell\u2019s work and turned it into screenplay language. He did a really good job at it. We\u2019re totally part of his cult. Because I believe in that hero\u2019s journey. Not to say that\u2019s the end all to end all and there are other ways to approach it, but it\u2019s a very interesting structure that can really lead to big breakthroughs. When you\u2019re struggling, you can look at the different archetypes that there are and often you find yourself falling into it. It\u2019s funny, like Requiem for a Dream, when I was working on it, it was before I read Vogler. But now that I look back, I was doing stuff similarly, where I was charting out where the characters\u2019 emotions were. What was interesting was that the graph was actually upside down. When something good was supposed to happen, something bad was happening. I was looking at it and one day I flipped it over and I said, \u201cOh. They\u2019re actually the bad guys, all my characters. The good guy is addiction and this is actually a hero\u2019s journey of addiction overcoming the human spirit.\u201d That\u2019s when I finally understood what the movie was about. Charting it and using hero\u2019s journey is how I was able to figure that idea out that this invisible monster, this craving, was actually the hero of the film. But that\u2019s great. Then the other thing back on what we talked about is to tell your story. Don\u2019t try to figure out what people want because the reality is \u2013 and I kind of learned this. When I was coming out of film school, I went to support my friend, Scott Silver, who is a big screenwriter now. He had directed a film that was at Sundance and it was the year that Welcome to the Dollhouse was there and a bunch of other indie gems. I remember watching these films and going, these are such specific, unique movies, but they\u2019re done exquisitely well. What Sundance allowed me to believe and what independent film has allowed so many dreamers to believe is that if you make a film well, no matter how personal it is, if it\u2019s truthful, you\u2019ll find an audience. Tim Ferriss: Not to invoke the name of Rick again, but I was having a conversation with Rick recently in a barrel sauna that is the exact replica of his barrel sauna, and we were talking about this deadline that I continually \u2013 I\u2019m actually working hard on the book. Darren Aronofsky: Give yourself a break, man. Tim Ferriss: I spend a lot of time talking about how hard I\u2019m working on the book. I was asking him some questions about working with musicians and whether he knows if something has hit the mark or not. I\u2019m going to paraphrase here, but he said effectively, \u201cGreat is always better than now.\u201d The way I interpreted that was there\u2019s always a good time for great, there\u2019s never a good time for mediocre. So if you feel like you rushed to hit some kind of a deadline \u2013 obviously there are realities of production and so on, don\u2019t get me wrong. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah, you can\u2019t rush. Rick\u2019s filled with wisdom. It always comes out so interesting. I get that. You can\u2019t force it. Tim Ferriss: The thread I want to tease a little bit, which is something you mentioned earlier, which is the argument between the strangers in the diner that then makes it into your movie. Could you tell me about your history with the game of Go? Darren Aronofsky: I got into it a lot when I was doing Pi. I needed a game for the two guys to be playing so that they had some reason that they were meeting so that Max and his mentor could meet. I just thought playing chess was just \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it so much and it\u2019s clich\u00e9 and mathematicians playing chess was just not quite interesting enough. At that point in \u201997, Go was still very much a fringe game. Sort of is, still. But I think it was much more fringe then. We used to go a lot to the New York Go Chapter meetings, which were like 18 very intellectual people in very book-lined apartments at different houses each week playing Go. It was a great cast of characters. The best thing about Go characters are the ones that blow off chess as a fool\u2019s game. They so look down on chess. It\u2019s just such a chip on their shoulder that they\u2019ve graduated to Go. Another thing that\u2019s fascinating that I\u2019ve been hearing a lot of people \u2013 I think actually Rick was talking to me about it, that\u2019s where I heard it. Tim Ferriss: Well, he\u2019s the one who suggested I ask you. Darren Aronofsky: Oh, there you go. He told me there was some documentary about what it meant, this computer finally beating these Go masters. He was telling me about a scene where after the first move, the Go master gets up and walks away because basically, I guess the point was that it\u2019s such a radical way to change how the game is played \u2013 how this computer is playing it, that it\u2019s actually affecting now how humans play each other. That\u2019s a line about AI that is interesting. Where it actually changes the way we act with each other after thousands of years of playing a game a certain way, suddenly this idea comes that is a moment of genius that changes the way we look at the board. That was an interesting idea. Tim Ferriss: And that\u2019s from a documentary? Darren Aronofsky: I believe so, but you have to ask Rick. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll ask Rick. Darren Aronofsky: It fascinated me. I\u2019ve been thinking about it since. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t want to take us totally off the rails. Darren Aronofsky: Do you play Go? Tim Ferriss: I have a Go board at my house. I am not good. I tend to play a highbrow version of Connect 5, which is Connect 5. My brother and I love to play. We just call it Connect 5 or something like that, where we use a Go board. It seems really childish, but my brother, he\u2019s a statistics Ph.D. and a very good chess player. These games can actually last a really long time. Darren Aronofsky: So it\u2019s just basically getting five in a row and you can place them anywhere on the board? Sounds great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It can take a long time. Darren Aronofsky: You don\u2019t flip tiles or anything? It\u2019s just about blocking each other. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. You leave them there. You\u2019re not capturing \u2013 well, you are capturing territory, but the rules are completely different from real Go. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah, my son came home from math class with that on paper and we played it for a while. I was like wow, this is a complicated game. Tim Ferriss: Super complicated. Go is so fascinating on many levels. One of which is you can feel like you\u2019re winning and effectively, if your pattern recognition is off, in a handful of moves, completely lose. The tide can turn a lot faster. I shouldn\u2019t say this with any degree of credibility because I know people like Josh Waitzkin are actually going to check. The game I got really into in Japan \u2013 my first trip abroad was a year in Japan as an exchange student at a Japanese school. I lived with a Japanese family. Darren Aronofsky: I listened to the session you did with the knifemaker. It was fascinating. Tim Ferriss: Oh yeah, Murray Carter. Murray\u2019s amazing. Darren Aronofsky: I want to get some of his knives, actually. Tim Ferriss: His knives are incredible. You should. They\u2019re so good. The Muteki line \u2013 his stuff is amazing. The game I got into was called Shogi. Shogi is Japanese chess. What makes Japanese chess different \u2013 and there are ways you can play western chess this way \u2013 but you\u2019re able to re-use the captured pieces and just drop them on the board at different places. Then also, not only do pawns get promoted, there are multiple pieces that turn into completely different pieces when they get \u2013 [Crosstalk]\u00a0 Darren Aronofsky: Very cool. It\u2019s like the Pok\u00e9mon of chess. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s really a cool game. I used to buy these books in Japan. Sumaishogi. Sumaishogi is, think of a really slow app, it\u2019s a book where you try to figure out the three or four moves in a given position necessary to win the game. Then there\u2019s an answer key. On the subway \u2013 because you spend a lot of time on the subway in Tokyo, at least I did \u2013 I would either read comic books or I would look at these sumaishogi or I would read judo textbooks. Darren Aronofsky: You do judo? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Darren Aronofsky: As an aside, it\u2019s funny. It was very upsetting when they got WiFi on the New York City subway because now I have to work hard. But my rule is to never take out your phone. Not because I\u2019m worried about it getting stolen or anything, but just because that\u2019s the chance to watch people for me. You don\u2019t want to get lost in your device at that point. That\u2019s a great time. The rule in New York is great. Basically, you can stare at anyone you want. If they make eye contact with you, you can never look at them again. But you\u2019re allowed to look as long as they don\u2019t look at you. People come to New York and I say, that\u2019s a rule. You can watch and check each other out, but if they realize they\u2019re being checked out, stop. I find it fascinating. I imagine the subways in Japan must be insane. Tim Ferriss: What shocked me \u2013 there are so many things that are so alien about Japan for someone who hasn\u2019t been exposed to Japan, specifically, even in East Asia. I\u2019ve spent time in China. I\u2019ve gone to school there. I\u2019ve spent time in Taiwan. I\u2019ve spent time in Japan. Japan and within Japan, Tokyo is just a particular brand of weird. You get on the subway and I remember a couple of things really striking me. Because I\u2019m 15, everything is backward, right? We\u2019re driving on the opposite side of the street. We have to take a shower before we get into the bath. All these rules that seem very Alice in Wonderland, topsy-turvy. Then I sit down on the subway and see these salarymen, who are on their way to work, these worker bees. They\u2019re reading comic books with the most explicit porn imaginable. They\u2019re completely nonchalant about it. Darren Aronofsky: Alien porn. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, tentacle porn, who knows? Then the other hilarious phenomenon I bumped to which I really didn\u2019t expect \u2013 you hear about in Japan perverts on the subways. There are definitely perverts on the subways and they\u2019re called chikan. So if you hear chikan, chikan, that means a pervert \u2013 [Crosstalk] Darren Aronofsky: Oh, really? Tim Ferriss: So if some guy is trying to fondle some girl\u2019s ass, you\u2019ll hear \u201cChikan\u201d and then there\u2019s a big kerfuffle. What they don\u2019t tell you is that \u2013 I remember one day, I was in my \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: You just put chikan and kerfuffle in one sentence. Just so you know. Tim Ferriss: It might be the first time ever. The singularity is near. I was in my school uniform, 15. Clearly a high school student. I have my judo uniform over my shoulder. It\u2019s wrapped up. I\u2019m standing up. It was a packed subway. I feel someone groping my ass. I\u2019m like, what is going on here? I can\u2019t turn around because it\u2019s so crowded. Eventually I\u2019m able to turn around and what do I see? Not what I expect. I see two really old women with half of their teeth capped in gold, chuckling to themselves because they\u2019d been grabbing my ass. These women are called Obatalian. Obatalian is from \u201cold battalion,\u201d but it refers to older Japanese women who just don\u2019t give a fuck anymore. It was a real cultural experience. Darren Aronofsky: My favorite, when I went to Japan for the first time, which was with Pi, I was a huge fan of \u2013 I dreamt for so long to go to Tokyo. I wanted to make a statement here. I want to be remembered. I\u2019m coming with this little film, what can I do? So I dyed my hair purple. I came and I\u2019m doing interviews the whole time with big, bright purple hair and no one mentions it. I get to my last interview and it\u2019s kind of a young, hip guy who\u2019s a pop star in Japan and we become buddies. I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, you know, I\u2019ve made my hair purple, but no one\u2019s commenting on it.\u201d He goes, \u201cHere, come to the window.\u201d We look outside and it\u2019s a major intersection. He says, \u201cWho has purple hair out there?\u201d All the old ladies dye their hair purple. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true! Darren Aronofsky: I\u2019m like, oh. Oops. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s totally true. 100% accurate. Ohmygod, I didn\u2019t fuse those together. That\u2019s true. I\u2019m having flashbacks. I think the old ladies who were grabbing my ass had purple hair. Darren Aronofsky: Just so you know, in Requiem for a Dream, they dyed their hair red and out there it\u2019s purple. So very funny. Tim Ferriss: So speaking of tentacle porn, that\u2019s about as graceful a segue as I can make. We don\u2019t have to talk about this if you don\u2019t want to, but this is one of the bullets that was recommended for me to talk to you about. I should preface this by saying, in my second book, The 4-Hour Body, there are two chapters on female orgasm, two on various aspects of male sexuality, so I\u2019m not shy about talking about this, but \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: Suddenly, I\u2019m on the Howard Stern show. Tim Ferriss: Suddenly, you\u2019re on the Howard Stern show. Restricting ejaculation. I don\u2019t have any context for this. But I was told to ask you about restricting ejaculation. Darren Aronofsky: Wow, where\u2019d you get that from? Tim Ferriss: My sources cannot be named. Is that something that you can tell us about? Darren Aronofsky: I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referencing. Oh, I think, oh, there we go. It\u2019s coming back to me. It was funny. In Requiem for a Dream, there\u2019s something in the background called Month of Fury. I guess it was early self-help. Wow, this is going way back. It actually kind of flows a little bit into probably why a growing friendship is happening here because we have similar roots in a certain way. When I was in film school \u2013 and this is another great thing for young film students to know is there\u2019s usually the first screenplay you write that will never get made. Believe me, that happens. At a certain point, you have to take the bold step to abandon it, because there\u2019s a learning process in that first script. I worked on a script that was set in Coney Island. I had a guy, a really talented kid I grew up with who probably if he went to Wall Street would be a hundred millionaire type of guy. He ended up getting involved in this kind of cult organization that are those guys who go around and sell roses and little toys around the streets wearing ties. I don\u2019t know if you ever see them. There are a lot on the West Coast. They\u2019re basically pyramid schemes where you basically open up an office and you hire ten 20-year-old kids and they go and hustle for you. You buy it from a guy above you. Then if you get a few, you slowly move up. They have these huge conventions in Vegas where they all come together and they have all these chants where they juice each other up and get all excited. When I was in film school, he was in the West Coast area. I just sort of studied it and hung out with him. Once again, here\u2019s another hang out with a friend but also kind of get stories. So I developed this whole kind of characters are world for this move about this. Eventually I didn\u2019t make that film, but I was able to take that character when I had to bring Hubert Selby Jr.\u2019s Requiem for a Dream alive. Sarah Goldfarb, the old lady, watched a lot of TV. But we couldn\u2019t afford the TV to put TV on the channel, so I decided to make my own TV show and create kind of a Tony Robbins-esque \u2013 because Tony was just starting. He didn\u2019t evolve into the kind of figure he is now. Now one really knew what it was. it was odd. So I created my own version of that and had this guy on TV. I had to give him a philosophy. I had an actor friend who was also a boxer and he had this thing called Month of Fury. Eddie DeHarp is his name. There were three roles, which are actually three great rules. It was 30 days no refined sugar. 30 days no red meat. 30 days no orgasm. Tim Ferriss: Were those all together? Darren Aronofsky: Yeah, you do all three for a month, for 30 days. It was actually very interesting. He preached it to me because he would do it before he would box. Tim Ferriss: One more time. No refined sugar? Darren Aronofsky: No refined sugar, so that\u2019s everything, like toothpaste, anywhere there could be sugar. No red meat, and then no orgasm. So in the movie, Requiem for a Dream, the third one is not actually pitched because I just thought it would be good as a little secret. Now I\u2019m giving it away. It\u2019s actually in there, but it\u2019s an Easter egg that\u2019s hidden in the film somewhere. It was funny because when we started working on it, I suggested to the actors that they should go on a Month of Fury before we make the movie, just to understand what it is to withdraw, which is a big part of the movie. It\u2019s hard if you\u2019re not a drug addict or a smoker to actually stop something for 30 days. To fast, as you talked about. It\u2019s really tricky. Here with three things that were seemingly not hard to do. \u00a0It was funny to see my actors at Day 24 and 25 wanting to kill me. Tim Ferriss: Hence the Month of Fury. Darren Aronofsky: I have another friend, my best buddy, who actually on Day 29, ended up proposing to a woman. I was like, you never propose on Day 29! What are you, out of your freaking mind? Tim Ferriss: The Month of Fury. Darren Aronofsky: The Month of Fury. If I ever did self-help, that would be \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so hey if you want to co-write it and start a movement, I know you got \u2013 [Crosstalk] \u00a0Tim Ferriss: The Month of Fury. All right. You heard it here first, folks. I think I could get quite a few people to participate in the month of fury. Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s actually very effective. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d like to ask quite a few questions about the new film. But the first is related to the writing of the film. When you are writing a film like mother! and there are many \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to give anything away \u2013 but many visual components, how do you write that type of material? Darren Aronofsky: Being the writer and then the director, I can not worry about that much. But there are two different steps. First you\u2019re writing and you\u2019re following along the emotional truth of the characters and following scene-by-scene what\u2019s going on and watching the story unfold. Then there\u2019s the next stage. At a certain point, you hang up most of your writing cap because you can always re-write if you\u2019re the writer. But then you start to become the director and start to think about blocking and movement. That was a very big deal in this film. Tim Ferriss: Can you define blocking for people who don\u2019t know what it is? Darren Aronofsky: Yeah, sure. Blocking is basically just how actors move in a scene. That\u2019s all it is. But it\u2019s really truly a big part of the work for a lot of reasons. First, you want to create blocking that\u2019s organic and natural to what the actors are doing in the scene. You want to make sure whatever the actor\u2019s doing makes sense with what their objective is in the scene, or what they\u2019re doing in the scene, or what they\u2019re not doing in the scene, or what they\u2019re hiding in the scene. You want to think about what that is all about. Then, there\u2019s a second tier, which is as the filmmaker, you\u2019re trying to make it as economical as possible, meaning as few setups, as few times to move the camera as possible because every time you have to sort of change where the camera is, you have to change the lighting and that just takes time. You want to get as much time shooting as possible. You\u2019re trying to figure out blocking what works best for the simplest amount of technical problems. Unless you\u2019re really trying to do something technically super challenging and stuff. You try to balance those. It\u2019s kind of a balance because sometimes you\u2019ll tell the actor, \u201cCan you help me out here with blocking?\u201d Because it means we have to do less. But sometimes you don\u2019t want to get in their way and you want them to be creatively free so you want to give them an open playground to play around in where they can do and move. It\u2019s a balancing act. But it\u2019s a big part of it. At a certain point, when the script is done, and in the case of mother!, I was actually lucky enough to have a three-and-a-half month rehearsal period, where basically I convinced Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem and Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris to join me in a warehouse out in East Brooklyn, where we basically taped out the set. We would work on the scenes and then we\u2019d get up on our feet and we would just start to block them. In the last two weeks of that three-and-a-half-month-long process, I actually brought in my cameraman and we shot the entire movie, moving the camera around, on video, as homework. Which was really fascinating because you figure out all different types of problems, like how\u2019s the camera going to get from \u2013 it\u2019s a constant, moving, handheld camera. So how am I going to get the camera from here to there because there\u2019s a wall there? That suddenly started to play into action. This film, it was a very restricted visual language that was part of one of the challenges I put in front of myself. Normally, you\u2019ll have a wide shot in a movie. The nice thing about a wide shot is if an actor somehow does something that\u2019s dramatically new, emotionally new, or if they decide to comb their hair a different way in each take, if you go out to a wide shot, basically the illusion is broken for a moment because the viewers\u2019 eyes have to take in more or a different part of scene or there\u2019s other things to look at. So that when you pop back into a closeup, you can get away cheap almost with what\u2019s happening and no one would ever notice. In the case of my film, since there were no wide shots, it was extremely challenging. The only shots in the film are either over Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s shoulder, on Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s face, or her point of view, which means what she\u2019s looking at. That\u2019s the only coverage in the entire film. So that\u2019s why this edit has been almost a year-long cut. Because I had such a limited amount of language to work with. I had to make every moment by moment by moment work, even though that\u2019s not really happening in real time. Tim Ferriss: Why did you choose to use that constraint? I feel like I could talk to you about constraints and rules for a really long time. Because you mentioned \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: The Month of Fury. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, the Month of Fury, exactly. Just get progressively more belligerent. You talked about having lunch scheduled for after a difficult meeting. Then you have shooting over Max\u2019s shoulder and different ways of, as you put it, limiting your visual palette. Why do that? Darren Aronofsky: I think starting as an independent filmmaker with very limited resources makes you strategically figure out economical means to basically take advantage of all the limited resources you have. I ended up actually stylistically creating techniques that actually turn those limited economics into a stylistic choice. I\u2019ve always been preaching that boundaries are the most important thing in any form of an art. When you\u2019re a painter, you have the boundaries of a canvas and the limitation of your colors. I think it\u2019s extremely important to do the same in filmmaking. To make real choices about how you want to do those limits. Sometimes they\u2019re self-imposed. I have less of the economic issues, although always you have to be very economically responsible for what you\u2019re doing. But I went really extreme on this film. I basically said, there\u2019s three shots for every scene, which is an incredibly low amount of shots than I would normally do in a movie. It just became an interesting exercise and experiment. There were times when Matty, my VP \u2013 he was like, don\u2019t you want to \u2013 you know, like never does a character come between Jennifer and the camera. No one ever crosses the lens. Tim Ferriss: I noticed that. Darren Aronofsky: Which is crazy because when we\u2019re doing crowd scenes with lots of people, it would be a lot easier to tell the story by having Jen get lost in the crowd and crowd come through, but no. My VP, Matty, was like, it could be \u2013 we talked about it for a while. I was like no, let\u2019s just remain orthodox here. Let\u2019s remain truthful to the intent. The one thing I was worried about, people would feel claustrophobic or bored by the style and that doesn\u2019t seem to be the response. People aren\u2019t seeing those limitations. I think that\u2019s because we just turned it into a language and into a style that people can understand. Tim Ferriss: Is there something you hope audiences will respond with or walk out with? Did you have an objective? This ties into, I suppose, the genesis of the film as well. I don\u2019t actually know the origin story. Darren Aronofsky: The origin story is hard because it\u2019s murky. I think it came out of these endless headlines, the endless stream of notifications on your telephone. The ability to scratch right beneath the surface of our civilization and realize how many desperate and awful things are happening around the planet still in this pretty enlightened time. There\u2019s a lot of rage and a lot of helplessness. What can I do? How can I stop this? Being an environmentalist when we\u2019re completely under assault, when what science is telling us is going on. The same people that use their smartphone every second and every minute of the day who say, well, science isn\u2019t always right. Yet, this, the product of science is in their pocket. Dominating their lives, yet refusing to see what\u2019s going on. How can you not say wow, there might be some connection going on? I don\u2019t know. I come from a science background. I witnessed how little, tiny, small changes by man can deeply have huge effects very quickly that are out of control. Then this new idea of these feedback loops, which isn\u2019t that new anymore. But these ideas that are becoming more idea that there\u2019s these tipping points where things are just going to start to accelerate. As a parent, I just sit there and I go, oh my gosh. I look at the beauty of my child and want them to forget about having a job, having a freaking atmosphere and having the ability to \u2013 it\u2019s crazy to ever think he\u2019ll really see an elephant in the wild in any type of wilderness way. I guess Prince William Sound was very much wilderness when I was a kid. Something happened to me when I was in Prince William Sound. We were kayaking, as I said, for weeks. I was eating a granola bar and the wrapper fell into the water. It was like a foil wrapper. I freaked out. I stopped. I tried to \u2013 it just went right under. Because of that guilt of that, I still, when I see trash on a beach, I pick it up for that foil. That guilt has carried me. Because at that time, it very much felt untouched. Like I was one of the first humans to ever experience it. There isn\u2019t a place on the planet anymore, not because of pollution only, but because of climate change, that isn\u2019t affected by humans. There\u2019s nowhere on the planet that is true wilderness as it was 60 years ago. I was writing a Western and I realized \u2013 it was set in 1883, I think \u2013 if every single person on the planet disappeared, dropped dead, was abducted or whatever at that point in time, besides some forged metals, belt buckles, horseshoes, bullets, guns, everything, every remnant of humanity would be gone in a century. Completely gone. Because everything was built out of earth materials. Then you suddenly have all these freakish new materials where every single bag of Lay\u2019s potato chip you have is something that\u2019s around for 10,000 years longer. Particles that are part of us. You can\u2019t escape it. So quickly. From my childhood, where there still were places on the planet that weren\u2019t feeling any impact. To now, where it\u2019s all changed. It\u2019s scary that people are just completely denying it and turning their backs on it. Out of that, I just want to howl. I felt the Ginsburg Howl. I just wanted to howl. I guess it\u2019s my howl. Tim Ferriss: What is the Ginsburg howl? Darren Aronofsky: Allen Ginsburg, the poem Howl. You never read that one? Tim Ferriss: Got it. Sorry, I\u2019m betraying my lack of education. Darren Aronofsky: That one you should read. That one\u2019s great. But it\u2019s basically, it was a cry from the \u201860s for his generation. At least that\u2019s the way I took it. Tim Ferriss: How would you like people to go into the movie? Who should go see the movie? Now, the obvious commercial answer might be everyone. Darren Aronofsky: Everyone! Well, I think you\u2019ve got to know you\u2019re going into a rollercoaster ride. When you get to the amusement park and you see that loop-de-loop and you\u2019re like, no freaking way. You should be ready for it. And no matter how much I prep you, and Tim can tell you, it goes there. Right? Tim Ferriss: Yes, yes it does. Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s intense. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s very intense. Darren Aronofsky: If you want an intense, different ride, if you want to see something different at the cinema, please come on down. That\u2019s what we tried to do is make a very unique rollercoaster. Except it may go off the tracks and into the concrete wall, but I can\u2019t really be \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be responsible for that. But that sort of happens. I just want \u2013 I think it works on a lot of levels. I was always thinking it was going to be really scary and tilting into the horror genre. Jen Lawrence, when she saw it, actually thought it was incredibly beautiful and moving. That there was a beauty to it. I\u2019ve heard that reflected in a lot of ways. It\u2019s definitely not your normal night at the movie, but it\u2019s the type of movie you go see and everyone will have something to say about it, I think. Hopefully there are not too many profane words directed in my direction. Tim Ferriss: Well, they could be profane but modifying something good also. There\u2019s that. I\u2019d like to ask about the sound. I have read that \u2013 well, a few things. That (a) a lot of independent films or films in general fail from poor audio quality. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah, that was a big thing I realized very young in my career. This is a pretty good movie, but something is off. It was always the sound. Tim Ferriss: The sound in this movie, and in more than one of your films certainly, is very \u2013 I\u2019m searching for the right words \u2013 but very visceral, very pronounced. I only read this other expression after the fact, after I saw the movie, but thinking of music or the sound as an additional character. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Could you elaborate on that? Because I\u2019ve never paid so much attention to sound in a film. Darren Aronofsky: I think it\u2019s \u2013 well, you saw a slightly unfinished \u2013 only the first half of the film was really dialed in. It\u2019s going to get better, I hope. That\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to be doing as we speak. Sound design for me is a huge tool. I got totally turned on when I was a young kid. I saw a documentary on the guys who did the sound design for Star Wars and they were out in the desert, banging on wires, making light saber sounds. It blew my mind. I was like, wow, that\u2019s such a cool idea that you can use any sound to do this and matching up sound and image, you can really mess around. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by that. But since I make these films where I really am trying to make the audience have a visceral experience with the character \u2013 in this case, Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s character \u2013 I try to draw the audience into her subjective point of view by creating a soundscape that starts of realistic, but then as things sort of shift and get more and more insane, it becomes more and more expressive and expressionistic. Tim Ferriss: I love the fact that people are going to be able to see this in theaters for a lot of reasons. I want to connect this to something else that I read about you, which relates to the historical lack of compliance to widget making. The story of you shooting Natalie Portman for Black Swan in the subway at something like 3:00 in the morning without necessary permits, without her having signed a contract. How do you \u2013 and I don\u2019t know as many filmmakers as you do, but I know a few. How do you get away with it? Meaning you seem to be able \u2013 and this is from the outside looking in \u2013 but to make the art you want to make and bend the rules or do things like that. Why is that? Are there certain contractual decisions or conversations you\u2019ve had that allow you to do it? Did you set the precedent as a problem child early so they\u2019re just like, oh, it\u2019s fucking Darren. So you get away with it? Darren Aronofsky: I mean, it\u2019s just the project. I don\u2019t think \u2013 it\u2019s never meant to be abusive. Tim Ferriss: No, I\u2019m not calling it that. Darren Aronofsky: No, but I\u2019m just saying. I think the reality is it\u2019s not abusive, it\u2019s about the work. It\u2019s always about the work. I think if you can relate back to that, this is about us bringing this to life in the best way. I think there are people that would take that line of argument and turn it into abuse or push the line to something that\u2019s not safe or fair. I think I\u2019m pretty empathetic to other people\u2019s feelings, maybe to a fault. Because I think some directors, it\u2019s kind of helpful to push past some of that pain and be blind to it, but that\u2019s just not my character. I can\u2019t do it. I feel when people are uncomfortable very easily. It makes me probably better as a director to read performance, but it probably gets me less than what I always need because I feel sorry sometimes. I have mercy. Tim Ferriss: How dare you? Darren Aronofsky: I think thought that when it\u2019s the work, you just go for it and people get excited by that. If you\u2019re actually being truthful about that, but there are times and places where I\u2019ve tried to do too much and people have pointed out to me, hey, that\u2019s probably not fair for these reasons. I hear that and then I just listen to myself if that\u2019s the truth or not. Tim Ferriss: If you have that conversation and it doesn\u2019t feel true to you, is that one of the primary causes of walking from potential projects? I guess all of this is sort of coalescing into a question of, if you were talking to a very promising, new director. Maybe they\u2019re a writer/director, but they direct. You wanted to prevent them from getting chewed up or corrupted by the system, is there any particular career advise that you would give to them? Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s a good question. I mean, you\u2019ve got to be doing it. I\u2019m always from the school that you\u2019ve got to do it because you have to do it. But you don\u2019t have any other choice but to do it. Just recently, I ran into a filmmaker and he was complaining and whining about doing a TV show because he really wanted to be making films. My advice to him was not to stick with your gut and do what you want. I could tell he was the type of guy that should be doing that TV show because I could see he was already past that point where he had crossed. I was like, do it. But then you find people who want to do what they do and you just want to support them and give them as much love and support to get it because they\u2019re trying their hardest to do something that only they can do. Tim Ferriss: Does that mean \u2013 for instance, I\u2019ve heard this advice with writing \u2013 that you should only write a book if it\u2019s easier for you to write the book than to not write the book. It has to be that much of a compulsion. Darren Aronofsky: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever easier to make a movie than not make a movie. Tim Ferriss: I guess maybe just from a personal, pain/pleasure standpoint? I remember reading an anecdote, and again, who knows, it\u2019s the internet. About you, actually, I think this might\u2019ve been from The New Yorker, about a diary entry where you were talking about a rave in Thailand. You were like, \u201cThe sun came up and the people were dancing and the people were dancing, and the sun came down and the people were dancing. The tides went out and I was miserable because I wasn\u2019t making movies.\u201d Darren Aronofsky: Yeah, that\u2019s true. Tim Ferriss: That means you have to make movies, right? Darren Aronofsky: I guess so. I think for me it was storytelling more than films. Although I think there were definitely in my past and experience that helped me. Very early on, I got into photography, into black-and-white photography when I was in junior high school. I would go into the darkroom and develop the film. I loved it. I don\u2019t know why that fell into my lab. It just so happened they had this lab nearby and I was able to take a class there. Then I just started thinking about photographs and taking pictures and all that. That all led to this. I think it could have gone any way. It\u2019s funny because when I was in college, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. The first couple years I was in college, I hadn\u2019t discovered filmmaking until I was a junior in college. I remember walking around, hitting myself in the head going, \u201cI\u2019m never going to find what I want. I\u2019m never going to find my calling.\u201d Then it happens for you, hopefully. It happened for me. I found something that \u2013 it was the first time I ever got an A in college was filmmaking. I was a B- student until film came along. The suddenly, boom. It was like something that kept me out of my girlfriend\u2019s room. I\u2019d rather be cutting the movie than laying in bed. I found it. But I think eventually it comes. But it could\u2019ve been a lot of things. I don\u2019t think necessarily \u2013 it\u2019s this kind of weird art form. It could\u2019ve probably come to me in lots of different ways. It was just something that I was like, okay. I see a path. I see something there. It\u2019s interesting and fascinating and there\u2019s a lot to learn in there. So I just went for it. Tim Ferriss: If I were to ask some of your closest friends what your super power is, maybe you wouldn\u2019t talk about it because you seem to be a pretty understated, humble guy. But what your super power is or what makes you different, what would they say? What might they say? Darren Aronofsky: I mean, my friend Dan, who does visual effects for me, I met him the first day of freshman year of college says, \u201cYou know, if people ask me if you\u2019ve changed, I say, you know what? He was asshole in college and he\u2019s still an asshole.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s what old friends are for. Darren Aronofsky: Exactly. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard for me to say. But definitely one of the best things about my life, as I talked about there, is I still hang out with the guys I went to nursery school with. I still hang out with the guys I went to high school with. I still hang out with the guys I went to college with. I think that having the roots \u2013 I\u2019m into roots. I\u2019m into loyalty. I work with the same filmmakers, pretty much. My friend Jed once said that \u201cThe guy who dies with the most friends wins.\u201d I thought that was pretty good advice. Tim Ferriss: If I were to pester your friends a little bit more, give them a few drinks and they get past the obligatory, still an asshole, he\u2019s still an asshole \u2013 if they got to the point of drunk reminiscing and sort of the emotional point of drunkenness. What would they attribute your success to? More people don\u2019t make it than make it in the film business. Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s a good question. Tim Ferriss: What would you attribute it to? We can make it direct. Darren Aronofsky: I mean, it\u2019s a combination. I had excellent parents that almost always supported me and always told me not to work so hard. Not to work too hard. When I would say, \u201cI got to go work,\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201cWell, don\u2019t work too hard,\u201d was their saying. That was after I got out of college. So up to college \u2013 they were both schoolteachers and academics was super important. But they also created very good responsibility and boundaries, but also didn\u2019t necessarily create opportunities, but gave me breathing room with support to find opportunities. I struggled in my 20s, but I was able to struggle in my 20s. That was, I think, a big part, was having that type of support system. And my sister. Family was a major part of it. I think that allowed me to have persistence. Which I always say is 9/10ths of the game. You\u2019ve got to get up to the plate to get that chance, to take that swing. To get to the plate just takes a lot of work. Then when you get there, it\u2019s preparation and homework. Having done all your homework, as well as you can and as much as you can. Then as you\u2019re taking the swing, make it a responsible swing for the team. I love the baseball metaphor. I wonder how much longer I can keep going. Tim Ferriss: With your students you teach, what is the name of the class? Darren Aronofsky: I don\u2019t do it regularly because I haven\u2019t found the best place. I taught at NYU for a bit and a few other places. To be honest, I wing it to see what kids are doing. I\u2019ll come in. I\u2019ll talk to them about what their dreams are, what their projects are. They all share, so I have them all describe each other\u2019s stuff. I love doing scene study with kids, where I have them put up a scene, work with actors, put up a scene. Tim Ferriss: Now, this is a scene that has already appeared in a film? Darren Aronofsky: No, a scene from their projects. They describe it to me, they tell me what they want. They\u2019ll put up the scene and then I\u2019ll give them my direction on how I would block it. I\u2019ll work with the actors. I\u2019ll just show them my process. Then I\u2019ll take a chalkboard out and I\u2019ll show them, how do we shoot it? I\u2019ll draw my designs to show them how to draw it. Tim Ferriss: And the chalkboard is sort of bird\u2019s-eye view? Darren Aronofsky: It\u2019s always bird\u2019s-eye view. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always \u2013 I know other filmmakers do it, but it was when I was 20 years old starting to do films, that\u2019s how I started. It\u2019s probably from playing Dungeons and Dragons as a kid. You get that sky view and I drew little triangles and I came up with all these different shapes and forms. I have my own language that I\u2019ve developed over the years for how to do it. I have the ability to look at that architectural plans and then to see it in 3-D below. That\u2019s how I do it. I do it very much from a bird\u2019s-eye view. Tim Ferriss: Dungeons and Dragons will be for Round 2. I was always a chaotic, good \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: You were a cleric? Tim Ferriss: I was a gray elf. Darren Aronofsky: You were a gray elf? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You were a cleric? Darren Aronofsky: No, I don\u2019t remember that well, actually. We played forever, but I don\u2019t actually remember my characters to well. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll bring some graph paper for next time. Darren Aronofsky: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: If you were to \u2013 this is related to the class \u2013 let\u2019s just say you could no longer make films. Your divinely assigned mission was to coach five to ten filmmakers. Not only would you get the psychic reward of seeing them do well, but much like someone who bankrolls a poker player, you would get a percentage of the future. What are the things you would focus on if you had a six-month period? Darren Aronofsky: If I was doing that I had a share of it, as soon as you bring the share into it, it\u2019s like, you know. Tim Ferriss: We could approach this a couple different ways. One is you get the profit share. So it\u2019s like a 50/50 split with them, plus you have a kicker, but you have to add some money in. We could do that. Darren Aronofsky: I would never do that. Film investment is an awful investment. Tim Ferriss: This is, of course \u2013 that\u2019s what we have huge, Chinese companies for. But the other could be really whatever reward you want to get out of it. It could be the acclaim and receiving awards and prizes and so on. It could be anything else. Darren Aronofsky: I mean, really, the gift of any teacher is to see whatever the goals of the student are, as long as they\u2019re righteous goals, be achieved. I would probably want to teach students that probably just wanted to tell good stories. I would want to see them make them as well as they could and then have them connect with as many people as they could. The awards, the money, that\u2019s all silly stuff. It\u2019s great for everything, but it really has as many issues with it as good things. It\u2019s just you\u2019d want to find people and I\u2019d want to find students that really just want to tell stories and entertain. Not that they\u2019d want to be a filmmaker because we\u2019re the rock star of the present day or the NBA basketball player of the day. It\u2019s because that\u2019s what they want to do. When I was a kid, no one knew what Spielberg do. We heard the names Lucas and Spielberg, but that was it. But not really. No one \u2013 how do you become a director? When I started to do it even in the early \u201890s, it was the early Sundance days. There wasn\u2019t this track record of how to do it. I wasn\u2019t looking for the reason to be that it could lead to something that was clear. It was just something that was interesting and fascinating to me. At this point, when there are all these paths to fame and money and all that. If you make one film, you can do a Marvel movie or something like that, which is happening all the time now. I think you want to find people that are looking to tell the stories and then help them tell the stories. The last class I taught at NYU, my best student was a Turkish kid who was going back to Turkey to tell a small story about an apple tree on the side of Mount Ararat that starts a village fight. A tiny story. It could be huge, who knows? But he was serious and he just wanted to tell that story. I gravitated to him and I spent most of my time in the class working with him to help him because he was the guy who was going to go make a movie and was serious and knew what he was doing. I said let me focus on this kid so the other kids can be inspired by this path. Tim Ferriss: Any top scripts if somebody has never read a screenplay and you\u2019re like, look, just start with A, B, C? Darren Aronofsky: I mean, the guys working today \u2013 Eric Roth, Scott Silver \u2013 read any of their scripts. They\u2019re great writers. Chris Terrio. There\u2019s a lot of great writers working right now. There\u2019s a lot of great scripts that I\u2019ve read. Charlie Kaufman\u2019s scripts are great and fun to read. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s enough to start with. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah, I think so. Tim Ferriss: Where can people find the film? Where should they learn more about it? I\u2019ve never had something \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: mother!? Tim Ferriss: Yes, exactly. Just for everybody listening, I highly recommend you check it out. Like Darren said, know you\u2019re signing up for a rollercoaster. But I\u2019ve had nothing produce this really unique, I\u2019ll get yelled at for modifying unique by someone I know, but that\u2019s okay. Just for him \u2013 a very unique dreamlike state for about 18 hours afterwards. Darren Aronofsky: That\u2019s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it was really profound. Where can people learn more about it? Darren Aronofsky: Well, it\u2019s mother! with a lowercase m and an exclamation point, which causes all different type of difficulties with social media because of the exclamation point. But by the time this comes out, I hope it\u2019s going to be around. If not, just Google mother! movie, and you\u2019ll be seeing a bunch about it, I hope. Tim Ferriss: Where can people, if they want to check you out on social media? Darren Aronofsky: Both my full name @darrenaronofsky on Instagram and Twitter. Instagram is pretty cool. I\u2019ve been doing this cool thing. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been following it. But I found two young film students and they were moving out to go to film school in LA and I rented them a big projector and a cube truck and they\u2019ve been driving through the country, projecting the word mother in different languages onto all different types of structures around the country. I\u2019ve been posting these beautiful images that these young filmmakers have been making to help self-promote my film. But also it\u2019s been a fun project to learn about all these different places all over America. It\u2019s kind of \u201cHumans of New York.\u201d Is that the name? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Humans of New York. Darren Aronofsky: Humans of New York. But more projections of mother. Tim Ferriss: Very cool. So people can say hi to you on the interwebs and check it out. Darren Aronofsky: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Any last asks or recommendations of the people beside seeing the movie? Darren Aronofsky: Keep seeing the weird stuff. Go out and support and then spread the word. I think if you dig the movie, get it out there and get everyone to go see it. I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s the type of film that you\u2019ll want to talk to other people about. Tim Ferriss: Well, I can attest certainly with one or two people I saw it with. We talked about it for hours afterward. One of the things I really enjoyed is it does not follow the typical template, any typical template that I can see. It leads to a lot of conversation. Darren Aronofsky: Dare to be different. Tim Ferriss: Dare to be different. Darren Aronofsky: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Well, Darren, I really appreciate the time. Darren Aronofsky: Thank you, Tim. It\u2019s been amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this has been really fun. We can keep going, but I want to let you get back to your \u2013 Darren Aronofsky: Next film. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. [Inaudible] polishing up everything.

tim.blog/attia, you will find three of them", "they start with dr", "peter attia on life extension, drinking jet fuel, ultra-endurance, human fois gras and more", "to the next one, optimizing investing, blood, hormones, and life", "then, my life extension pilgrimage to easter island", "it\u2019s a long story, but check it out at tim.blog/attia", "but back to darren", "darren aronofsky", "you can find him on twitter and instagram @darrenaronofsky, to say hello", "he\u2019s doing some very cool stuff on instagram, and darrenaronofsky.com", "he\u2019s the founder and head of the production company, protozoa pictures", "he is the acclaimed and award-winning filmmaker behind cult classics like pi, requiem for a dream, and the wrestler, which are really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his filmography", "but going back to the beginning, pi, his first film, that was 1998, won him early plaudits and a best director award at the sundance film festival", "aronofsky, that\u2019s darren, later directed and produced the wrestler, which i absolutely loved", "it made its premiere at the venice film festival, which happens to be the oldest film festival in the world, where it became only the third u.s", "film in history to win the esteemed golden lion award", "darren later directed the indie box office phenomenon, black swan, which won natalie portman the academy award for best actress and garnered four other oscar nominations, including best picture", "then, his biblically inspired epi, noah, opened at no", "1 at the box office and grossed more than $362 million worldwide", "his latest movie is mother!, a psychological horror thriller film, starring jennifer lawrence, javier bardem, ed harris, and many others \u2013 michelle pfeiffer, it goes on", "i\u2019ve had a chance to see this movie and i\u2019m stumbling over my words because it\u2019s hard to describe", "it was mind-bending, super intense", "i walked around in a dream state for an entire day after seeing this", "it is unlike anything you have ever seen", "so if you want to strap on your seatbelt and go on a rollercoaster, i suggest that you check it out", "without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with darren aronofsky", "darren, sir", "welcome to the show", "thank you, tim", "i have been looking forward to meeting you for some time now", "thank you", "i\u2019m a big fan as well", "we have quite a few mutual friends", "i have some suggestions, i won\u2019t mention them by name yet, as to topics and questions", "i wanted to start with a question about your writing environment", "oh, that\u2019s a good question", "i\u2019ve read a little bit about a desk", "a peculiar desk", "yeah", "could you describe this desk and if you still use it", "it was interesting", "i know you\u2019ve spent time in japan", "i was in japan probably promoting, i don\u2019t know if it was pi or requiem for a dream, and i went to some spa town south of tokyo", "i can\u2019t remember the name of it", "i guess it was the kind of nexus of this place where they make these puzzle boxes", "i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen them", "they\u2019re kind of beautiful, patterned, wooden boxes", "you can\u2019t see any hinges or any spaces", "but if you slide a few panels in a certain order, and it could be up to 8, 16, 32 moves, depending on how much money you want to spend, eventually it opens and there\u2019s a secret compartment", "it blew my mind", "i had never seen any type of souvenir like it", "i bought a couple", "i played with it for a long time", "then i think it was early days of the internet, so i started to google a little bit about what it is", "it\u2019s a whole art form", "i won\u2019t try to butcher the japanese word for it", "but i then noticed that there were contests worldwide and that there was this one dude who was winning contests year after year", "he was a guy in colorado", "i was like, oh, that\u2019s kind of interesting", "randomly i tracked him down and i sent him an email", "his name is kagen sound", "i sent him an email", "i said, \u201chey, did you ever think of doing any furniture?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cactually, i\u2019m working on this thing for a library.\u201d i said, \u201cwell, it would interesting maybe to do a desk out of it.\u201d he loved the idea", "it was amazing", "he\u2019s a true master", "we should probably go over to my house and check it out", "i would love to see it", "david saw it", "i don\u2019t know if he told you about it, but he freaked the hell out", "so david blaine", "yeah, this is part of why i\u2019m asking", "okay, cool", "anyway, the whole thing is made completely out of wood", "he doesn\u2019t work with any other materials but wood", "i\u2019m not sure the count on puzzles in the desk, but there are scores of them", "eventually, they all work together to build to a final release, where basically he was able to turn it into a musical instrument", "he created bellows all controlled with wood in the drawers", "actually, by pushing the drawers, it creates sounds", "it has a full octave", "he asked me what song i wanted", "he then was able to build a computer, a thing that has switches that are all blown by the bellows and if they\u2019re done in the right order, a panel flaps open in the back with a secret drawer", "it took him five years to do it and it was insane", "i think the price we agreed on was a crime at the beginning", "a crime to him or a crime to you", "a crime to him", "then i realized i didn\u2019t have a chair for it, so then i said, we should make a puzzle chair for it", "i paid through the nose for that to get him back", "but it\u2019s a beautiful thing and it\u2019s a great desk", "i want to say i read this in a previous interview that you\u2019ve referred to yourself as a nomadic writer", "writing in one place for a few weeks and then moving locations", "how does your writing process differ project to project", "how do you use the desk we were just talking about and combine that with shifting locations", "i\u2019m on book deadline right now, so i\u2019m thinking about this", "of course, i\u2019ll do anything to avoid writing, including interviews", "exactly", "i completely understand that procrastination", "but my writing partner, a guy i write with a lot, ari handel, once said to me, probably the most important thing i taught him was that \u2013 and i didn\u2019t do this on purpose \u2013 was that procrastination is part of the process", "that actually your brain needs a break every once in a while", "not to say to abuse that, but to be a little easy on yourself and allow yourself to go to a bookstore, to go to a museum", "if you are serious your work, even when you\u2019re not working you are working", "your brain is putting stuff together", "inspiration comes from the strangest places, as we all know", "you suddenly stumble on something that\u2019s exactly what you were looking for when you didn\u2019t know you were looking for it", "but it\u2019s changed my writing process", "what i used to do was a tremendous amount of prep, where we would do a tremendous amount of research and outlines and eventually get to a place where we were exhausted with that", "then i would do something called the muscle draft, where i would go and disappear somewhere", "usually far away, where i could be very alone and be very lonely", "that loneliness would inspire me to work hard and fast", "i would muscle out a draft", "which meant i would never go back", "it was all about just pounding through it to get to the end as quick as possible", "it was like a two, three-day process", "you come out with \u2013 if it ended up being a 120-page screenplay, you\u2019d have a 79, 80-page screenplay", "but in that muscle draft, there would be moments when you do enter that zone", "i don\u2019t know if you have a term for it if you run into it", "but there\u2019s that zone where you forget time", "i imagine athletes are doing it", "rock musicians seem to be doing it when their eyes roll back in their head", "but as a writer, every once in a while you get that where time disappears and something comes on the page", "that scene is often something that ends up staying all the way through to the end of the process", "when you are muscling out that first draft, is it in \u2013 are you using screenwriting software", "is it just kind of brain vomiting bullets into a word document", "what does it look like", "i\u2019m trying to think", "final draft has been around for a long time now and it\u2019s a great software that i\u2019ve used", "i don\u2019t know if pi was written on it", "that was \u201997, so i doubt it probably", "i probably was formatting stuff back then", "i don\u2019t really remember", "but that just helps you", "it helps you work quicker because of dealing with indentation, you press tabs and shortcuts to get through it quicker", "screenwriting is very much like sculpture in the sense that if you start with a piece of clay, you don\u2019t want to just focus on the hand", "any artist that does that will tell you then the hand will be grossly detailed and enlarged compared to the rest of the body", "you just want to slowly start cutting away at the clay to get closer and closer to the final form", "but you don\u2019t want to get the sandpaper out until you\u2019re ready for that level of detail work", "so it\u2019s just about passes", "you keep going through it", "once you say, \u201ci\u2019m going to start writing,\u201d even if you get to page 30 and you think page 5 needs something, you just make a note of it and then zap to the end before you ever go back", "so it\u2019s really like working slowly away at that big clay", "do you no longer do the isolation retreats", "i do it less and less", "i mean, a funny story i was just telling my son", "when i wrote pi, my friend actually who does visual effects for me, his parents had a little cabin outside of woodstock", "i was like, \u201chey, can i go there for a few days and pound out my muscle draft on pi,\u201d and he was like, \u201cyeah, sure.\u201d i went up there", "his parents were intellectuals and just had books and books and books", "they were academics, so there were tons of books", "i was procrastinating, looking through the books", "and of course, the only book that caught my attention was carrie, which i had never read", "so i proceeded to pound through procrastinating by reading carrie, scaring the living crap out of myself", "when you read king, it\u2019s just like wow", "then i really had to write quickly because i had to get the hell out of this cabin", "i think i wrote the first draft of pi in 18 hours", "but to talk about now, it\u2019s funny, this new movie, mother!, is a very different process", "the most different process than i\u2019ve ever done", "and probably more similar to where i started", "i wrote the script in five days", "it was this kind of fever dream when it happened", "i had the idea two weeks before", "it started off with this idea for this allegory with a real relationship drama at the core", "but i didn\u2019t know how to structure it", "then i had this breakthrough of what the structure is", "i had a five-day weekend without \u2013 my son was with his mom and i was all alone", "i just sat in my kitchen", "i actually didn\u2019t even go up to the desk", "i just pounded it out in my kitchen in my underwear, barely eating", "it was just like this fever that came out of me in five days", "when i was done with the script, i showed it to my producers, who didn\u2019t know i was even working on something", "they were like, \u201cwow, i think there\u2019s something here.\u201d it\u2019s weird", "i think i\u2019ve always been jealous of musicians", "you hear the story where bob dylan wrote a song in the afternoon and it became the anthem for a generation", "but as filmmakers, we really don\u2019t get to do that", "it takes us two to five years", "black swan, the first meeting with natalie was ten years before i shot it", "the wrestler was eight years", "the fountain took me six years", "noah was an idea for 20 years", "it\u2019s a long time", "but i was like, is it possible as a filmmaker to take a single emotion and a feeling of \u2013 it\u2019s kind of what i was feeling right at that moment \u2013 and try to channel it into a single track and into a movie", "i think it kind of captures a single emotion in this film", "even though it has other stuff, it really was one color that burst right through", "i want to talk something maybe related to a fever dream", "the idea or the concept of, madness", "i want to say, i\u2019m certainly paraphrasing, but that maybe you\u2019ve said that by walking the tightrope between sanity and insanity, you can learn what sanity is", "or something along those lines", "do you have a fascination with madness", "why do people have that perception", "i had an uncle who was schizophrenic", "so i grew up around that", "i got to see it very close", "i sort of saw his mindset and also how it weighed on my family", "the emotional ripples from that were tremendous", "then i also saw how society treated people like that", "it\u2019s something i\u2019ve been very close to and i\u2019ve always thought about it", "i remember reading \u2013 what was it", "the denial of death", "did you ever read that book", "no", "that\u2019s a good one for you", "but they talk about the liminal, the line, the thin line between the \u2013 conscious and subliminal", "or, i think how they were using between genius and insanity", "there were things that my uncle would say", "he was a highly functioning guy", "he worked as an engineer for new york city for his entire life and had a pension and all that", "made it through, but lived a very tough life because of the illness", "he would say things that were just unbelievably brilliant", "i remember one time, my dad was talking to him about how to do something", "i don\u2019t remember exactly the details", "he said \u2013 well, i can\u2019t really say this on radio, right", "oh, you can say what you want", "you can", "he said something like, \u201cyeah, that\u2019s like if you fuck a snake, you get an elephant.\u201d i remember hearing it", "i was 12 or 13", "but that\u2019s kind of a crazy metaphor and kind of beautiful and it\u2019s so extreme", "it was like the best way of saying yeah, right", "like you\u2019re selling me the brooklyn bridge", "but he had many of those that were just sort of like, that\u2019s not proper english, but it kind of works", "i\u2019ve always had an absolute fascination with that very thin line", "when i was an undergrad \u2013 i\u2019m not a mathematician", "in fact, part of the reason i went to princeton is that, at the time of least, did not have a math requirement", "i was scared off of math by a very belligerent teacher in tenth grade", "oh, that sucks", "it was terrible my brother, in fact, same grade, different teacher, was steered in the opposite direction and is finishing a ph.d", "in statistics", "that shows you what teachers can do", "but i was drawn to a few, specifically, mathematicians at princeton, who were really riding that razor\u2019s edge and had multiple suicide attempts, but were all brilliant beyond all description", "i personally, and in fact, i also have a cousin who\u2019s schizophrenic, which was relatively later onset, and became effectively a different person", "still very smart", "have you ever worried that you would bleed over that edge", "luckily, my hubris doesn\u2019t go that far where i get that worried", "i\u2019m not a crazy hypochondriac, but yeah, sure, when i was a \u2013 i think when i was a teenager and i read somewhere that schizophrenia\u2019s onset can happen in your 20s", "that idea that when you\u2019re a fully formed human being, suddenly things can change for you", "that was a scary idea", "will it happen for me", "i definitely think when it came to perhaps exploring plant enhancements, i was always a little terrified that i might go too far in a certain direction", "it\u2019s always been in the back of my head a little bit, just because, you know, a lot of that stuff is genetic", "but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s really haunting me", "but i guess maybe a little bit you thought of maybe the possibility, the fear of it", "yeah, well, i almost offed myself in college", "i went through a very dark period that i actually talked about really publicly in a major way for the first time on stage at ted, which really shut the room down", "good for you", "i think it\u2019s important", "but that is always or has always been in the back of my mind", "one of the things that i got from \u2013 as you put it, place enhancements \u2013 or psychedelic experience was temporarily experiencing what could only be, it would have to be on some level synonymous with extreme mental illness", "definitely", "there\u2019s a neural connection", "and developing more empathy as a result, living in a place like san francisco, where you\u2019re just surrounded by people who homeless and mentally ill", "one of the topics i had down to talk about was psychedelics, which was suggested by someone we both know who will remain nameless for now", "i want to know who that was", "[crosstalk] \u2013 how he feels", "there are only three", "but what role has that played in your life", "how do you think about it as fitting into your life", "look, i\u2019ve researched it, read a lot about it", "i think it\u2019s very interesting", "the story of deer in siberia that eat mushrooms and fall over and it doesn\u2019t seem there\u2019s any \u2013 survival of the fittest, evolutionary positivity for a deer to make itself that helpless", "so maybe there is something else going on", "some other medicine or something else that this creature is getting out of putting itself at risk was just a fascinating idea", "the fact that shamanism and reaching alternative states has been part of our culture for a super long time and then somehow got completely washed out", "i don\u2019t know, turned into the sacrament, maybe rock and roll music", "but we really lost anything that sort of trying to reach away from scientific reality is clearly a loss", "it seems like there\u2019s a lot of wisdom to come out of some exploration in a safe type of example, as long as it\u2019s very controlled environments", "there\u2019s clearly tremendous benefit that\u2019s happened for society that\u2019s recently been discovered and is being rediscovered right now", "i\u2019m involved with some research at johns hopkins and a few other places related to the use of psilocybin specifically in potentially addressing treatment-resistant depression, among other things", "that\u2019s what\u2019s fascinating out of all that stuff that maps is doing with ptsd and the fact that the defense department is supporting it because it seems to be working", "i just saw a film that came out of israel that is using mdma to sort of help people deal \u2013 not just soldiers \u2013 but people deal with all different types of emotional distress", "it\u2019s fascinating and it\u2019s interesting and it\u2019s clearly \u2013 if the defense department is supporting it, then it\u2019s probably pretty interesting to them", "i think it\u2019s also a really smart place for research to start", "or one at least to the subsets of the population that\u2019s very smart to work with is returning vets", "specifically, among other reasons, because it is a nonpartisan issue", "it\u2019s very hard to be like, \u201cfuck the vets.\u201d or \u201cscrew the terminal cancer patients who want to decrease end-of-life anxiety.\u201d it\u2019s funny though because another thing i\u2019m involved with is i\u2019m on the board of directors for the sierra club", "a big part of what sierra club is trying to do is get vets into nature", "we have all these different programs that do that", "in fact, i actually went to the arctic with two vets", "it was amazing for them \u2013 not just to have that experience, which is completely mind-expansive to see nature in a true \u2013 see true wilderness, like what\u2019s happening in the arctic", "but i think to a lot of them, what they expressed to me is this is what they were fighting for", "to defend this and their spirit", "so they actually get to see the beauty of america outside of the cities that they\u2019re from", "i want to continue to talk for a little bit about really old traditions", "what we\u2019re talking about, or at least some of these traditions have existed for millennia", "fasting is another one", "have you done experiments with fasting", "a little bit", "it\u2019s something i definitely want to get more into", "i\u2019ve been totally into the idea for a long time", "of course, i fast once a year", "not that i\u2019m religious, but because i like the spiritual practice of fasting once a year with my buddies", "so i get together with my friends and fast for that one day", "but a long-term fasting i think is fascinating", "i\u2019ve heard great stories about it, but i haven\u2019t actually had \u2013 it\u2019s amazing how little that goes on in our privileged lives and how that\u2019s just a very interesting practice", "what is interesting about it to you", "because i try to do it, for instance, i try to do \u2013 and note to people listening \u2013 i\u2019m not a doctor", "i don\u2019t play one on the internet", "don\u2019t be stupid", "talk to a qualified medical professional, blah, blah, blah", "i tend to do at least three days of consecutive fasting per month and then i do longer fasts a few times per year", "wow", "you do just water", "i will make some allowances", "i do it differently at different times", "what i will sometimes do is use fasting as a way to kickstart ketosis", "so clicking over into ketosis", "certainly, our friend, peter attia, knows a lot about it", "he was in ketosis for about two and a half years straight", "but fasting for a period of time what i will allow if i\u2019m doing a longer fast, in particular, is i will allow myself non-caloric drinks that are unsweetened", "so let\u2019s say black tea, black coffee", "and kitkat bars", "and kitkat bars", "only zero-calorie kitkat bars", "i will also, particularly in the beginning, allow myself some exogenous ketones", "they\u2019re just supplemental ketones", "or fat like coconut oil, to help with the transition", "that\u2019s great", "but besides that, nix", "then the pain is after two, three days, right, it\u2019s supposed to ease off", "yeah, for most men \u2013 women can sometimes take a little longer to click over", "for most men, about two to three days and then you can click over", "all right, well, let\u2019s do it", "i\u2019m in", "what interests you about fasting", "once again, it\u2019s clearly a way to explore other spaces", "i immediately \u2013 for me, if i\u2019ve got a difficult meeting where i have to be a jerk because something is not getting done correctly", "if i skip breakfast and do it close to when lunch is, i get stuff done", "so in my own way, i do micro fasting to control my mood", "knowing that some of that anxiety and anger will disappear as soon as i eat", "so it\u2019s sometimes a good thing to motivate me to help with the work in certain ways", "i do my own mood enhancement", "for a long time, i was dating someone and we used to get at each other and then finally, someone turned me on to the word \u201changry,\u201d which i think is probably pretty common now, but at the time, it was a pretty new word", "it kind of changed my relationship and kept the relationship going for the next three or four years because we could actually identify why we both became assholes for a little bit", "so clearly it\u2019s a major mood blocker and changer and alternator and all that stuff", "i think that\u2019s interesting", "then i\u2019ve heard and read all about the health benefits of it", "then, of course, there are all the meditative elements of it", "the control, the mind over the body", "david blaine is always demonstrating going to some serious extremes", "but i think there are lessons to be learned and experiences to be had during it", "this is sort of the nature of my fragmented mind that we\u2019re going to jump around a lot", "you mentioned difficult conversations or where you have to be an asshole", "i had read about, while very much in passing, you had a conversation with mickey rourke before filming", "well, mickey\u2019s version \u2013 [crosstalk] well, no, so i actually don\u2019t have a whole lot of context, but roughly that you knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy and that he had a lot of strong opinions", "so you had an honest, upfront conversation", "yeah", "i would love to hear how you open a conversation like that or plan for it", "mickey, at the time, had an awful reputation", "i think that\u2019s because he \u2013 i think in many ways, he was his worst enemy because he loved acting, but he also loved boxing", "he had this fight and struggle between him which one he was going to focus on", "i think he really respected the box", "anyway, whatever happened to him, everyone was warning me about it, everyone", "but i love him", "i loved his work", "before i knew him, i thought his work was exceptional", "i felt it was a crime on the acting arts that he did not have more opportunities to share himself with the world because whenever he has shared himself, it was unbelievable", "from barfly to angel heart, to all of that beautiful, early work he did", "then it just sort of disappeared", "but i just wanted to be very clear with him because i felt i just knew how challenging the film we were about to do was going to be", "i find that the longer i do this, the more clear you can be up front, the better", "no matter what happens, it always changes", "i think people sometimes don\u2019t really hear what you\u2019re saying to them a lot because they really want to do something", "so i try to be very straightforward and clear because i want to get as many of the problems off the table because when we do get to set, time is really the biggest enemy or foe because it\u2019s so short and it happens so quickly that if you start getting into stupid things that weren\u2019t pre-discussed, it\u2019s a nightmare", "so you have to be as completely prepared and professional as you can when you\u2019re spending whatever it is \u2013 $20,000 a minute or whatever it may be that day", "mike tyson money time is what i\u2019m talking about", "you want to be on top of your game", "i just went in very clearly with mickey", "i think what it meant for mickey for it is he looked at me like medicine", "it tasted really bad, but he knew it was good for him", "so he just closed his eyes, opened his mouth and swallowed to get it done and really to keep \u2013 because i think he knew deep in his heart that what i was trying to do was make a great film with him", "then he rose to it and brought it", "he talks about that meeting like the little, skinny punk coming to him and pointing his little stubby finger in his face \u2013 which i love", "it\u2019s funny", "i wish i was that tough and that straightforward", "i\u2019m sure i was more cordial and polite to him because i was, i know i was in awe of him and excited to meet him", "but i just wanted to be clear that look, if we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re going to do this", "let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and go for it", "because for me, filmmaking is so hard", "i think for a lot of people, there are just so many challenges", "literally, every single film i\u2019ve done has been like its own ipo", "it\u2019s own corporation", "i start off with an idea", "i have to attract talent and money to come together", "yes, there\u2019s a formula but i generally am making things that don\u2019t quite fit into the widget factory", "they\u2019re a little weird and stuff", "yeah, i don\u2019t think they fit in the widget factory", "so i have to convince people why it\u2019s going to be a widget", "then we have to raise the money and hopefully make it and get the investors\u2019 money back", "i\u2019m 5 for 6, which isn\u2019t bad", "but each time, it\u2019s a real, it\u2019s a lot of work", "you want to make the whole process of it, for all the artists working with you, as easy as possible", "that\u2019s not really where you want to put your fighting", "you want to do your fighting for the world and the money and all that", "let\u2019s say you\u2019re making a new film", "you\u2019re working with someone who you respect, just to depersonalize it a little bit", "although, you could give a real example", "let\u2019s say like mickey, someone you really admire, who has a reputation for being very strong-willed and you\u2019re going to have this conversation again", "how do you open it", "what are some of the phrases that you use to prevent it from blowing up or to try to allow it to go well", "i\u2019ve never done a situation where i\u2019m asking someone, hey, we\u2019re going to waterboard you for three months", "i mean, we\u2019re trying to do something that\u2019s exciting and hopefully beautiful and striving to make art", "so that\u2019s the underlying agreement", "you\u2019re walking into that conversation", "hey, i dig you, you dig me, let\u2019s try to make this work", "but just to be clear, these are some of the things that are going to be going on that will probably make you feel uncomfortable", "what would be some examples of those", "a very clear example would be when working with women (or men) if there are things that are sexual in nature \u2013 what\u2019s required nudity-wise and all that type of stuff", "you have to talk about that beforehand because, of course, it\u2019s very sensitive material", "you want everyone to be comfortable and very clear on why you\u2019re doing something", "anytime you do a lovemaking scene, what exactly is it going to be and why", "i\u2019ve never really don\u2019t a lovemaking scene to make it an erotic thing for an audience", "i always try to tie it in narratively", "so i tell them very clearly where the camera is going to be, what we\u2019re going to do, how we\u2019re going to run the set, stuff like that", "the same thing with violence", "violence, i think, is just as important in the other way of how we\u2019re going to be demonstrating violence, how we\u2019re going to show it", "for me, that\u2019s a huge pet peeve", "because i feel in this country, sexuality and violence have flipped, especially in the movies", "where you can have as much violence as you want in a pg, pg-13 movie, but you can\u2019t have an ounce of sexuality in a pg or pg-13 movie", "that, to me, is disgusting", "i don\u2019t have words to go beyond that", "the fact that we\u2019re training our kids to fire guns at such a young age, with nerf guns and video games, it\u2019s disgusting and disturbing while any form of saying there\u2019s a beauty in the human physical connection that no, we can\u2019t talk about that", "the fact that the mpaa sort of reinforces that", "i\u2019ll go off, but like guns in ads", "i\u2019ll walk down the street \u2013 when my kid was 5, 6 years old and my kid\u2019s pointing at huge, crazy, sexy-looking machine guns on the biggest movie stars in the world", "it\u2019s disgusting", "the gun companies are getting free ads", "yet, you can\u2019t show someone kissing", "there\u2019s a whole sort of bend with that", "i don\u2019t know how i got there, but i got there", "i\u2019m sorry", "that\u2019s all right", "i don\u2019t know how i get to where i go half the time", "i want to talk a little bit about the word, \u201ccatharsis.\u201d i recently saw your new film", "i really enjoyed the experience and came away \u2013 i told you this \u2013 for a full day afterward was in this dreamlike state", "wonderful", "which i savored", "i had a lot of questions", "sometimes i feel like we \u2013 actually, i think milan kundera i think said that the stupidity of man is that he has all the answers and the intelligence or beauty of a novel is that it\u2019s a question for everything", "something like that", "that\u2019s interesting", "i\u2019m paraphrasing", "this is in his book of laughter and forgetting", "at one point, i recall reading that you didn\u2019t intend people to find catharsis in your movies", "they expect to have happy endings and so on, but perhaps the catharsis comes the day after seeing the film", "what do you want the experience of your audience to be", "what do you want them to take away from any one of your films", "you could give a concrete example or in general something that drives you", "well, i guess i start off with the first rule of filmmaking is never to bore an audience", "that, to me, is the worst feeling and experience when i\u2019m watching a movie and my mind is wandering and maybe looking at the color splatter across the screen", "i think you always want to engage an audience", "not just visually, not just through sound, but emotionally", "i think that\u2019s rule one is to just to give people an engaging, memorial experience for two hours, whatever you\u2019re running time is", "then i think, on top of that you can hopefully layer in some ideas so that when people leave the theater, it\u2019s not like 15 minutes later, what did we watch", "i don\u2019t want to be the mcdonald\u2019s of movies, where just the wrapper is all that\u2019s left over", "i want people to be thinking a bit about it and talking about it", "for me, one of my best life experiences was just randomly i walked into a coffee shop", "it happened to be around the corner from where pi was playing at the new art", "a dad came in with his 18-year-old daughter and two of her friends", "the four of them were sitting there, just talking about this black-and-white movie that they had just seen", "i just eavesdropped; listening to them, just thrilled that there were a conversation and a debate", "what did that mean", "and what did that mean", "for me, that\u2019s always been \u2013 the films i love, yes, there are movies that you have a great experience in and enjoy and it\u2019s just a great pleasure to watch and a great experience", "but i also like the ones that make you scratch your head and you think about and you talk and you debate", "because you want to have an impact", "i think in today\u2019s landscape, a lot of things are disposable and it\u2019s really quick how disposable they are because of how much stuff we\u2019re being bombarded with day after day after day", "it\u2019s nice to hopefully have something that reflects back on it and thinks about it", "you mentioned emotion", "i think you had said emotional connection or engagement", "what are some of the ingredients that help to create that", "because most films fail", "i think anyway", "it starts with what i think is the greatest invention of the 20th century, which is overlooked, which is the close-up", "that\u2019s the great thing about cinema is the fact that you can stick a camera right in the face of paul newman, right in those beautiful blue eyes", "you can go right into his soul", "then when you project it months later to an audience or years later, potentially centuries later, you are anonymous in that audience, yet you can feel the empathy", "because, in reality, two people talking and hanging out, how much eye contact do you make", "there are lots of other things going on in this room that you\u2019re taking in", "that air conditioning rattling", "my guys mixing in the other room", "but the actual connection with another human being, where you\u2019re really looking into their soul and not thinking about yourself", "because the thing is when i look at you and you look at me, we\u2019re thinking a little bit about wow, now i\u2019m making us uncomfortable looking at each other and we\u2019re going to be looking away", "but in a movie and via the close-up, you can be unconscious and fully be in paul newman\u2019s head, even though you don\u2019t exactly what he\u2019s thinking, you can study him and steal that thought", "that to me is the greatness of cinema or one of the great things about cinema", "that\u2019s where you get the emotion", "what happens is if you start linking different emotions together, hopefully, you start to tell a story", "what the story does is it expands the emotion", "just like a joke \u2013 set up, set up, set up, payoff", "that\u2019s the classic structure of a joke", "it\u2019s the same thing with drama, where you\u2019re setting up a character and building character", "you give him a challenge and then you see them go through that challenge and payoff", "then there\u2019s always the pitfall when it all falls apart and then they rise up", "that hero\u2019s journey is just so \u2013 i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s genetic", "i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s part of the human condition", "i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something that we\u2019re taught very young in our first dr", "seuss books", "but it\u2019s something that we all around the planet in every language, in every culture, can relate to", "for me, the power storytelling happened \u2013 i graduated high school early and backpacked around europe and the middle east", "i ended up in the gemma in marrakech", "i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been there", "i haven\u2019t", "it\u2019s an amazing in the middle of the souk, where they have all the shops and stuff", "at nighttime, it\u2019s filled with snake charmers and food and all this stuff", "there was this one old guy, leaning on a cane in a beard, telling a story", "he had a huge crowd around him", "it was all in arabic and i didn\u2019t understand a freaking word, but i was mesmerized", "i was like, that\u2019s what i want to do", "i want to tell stories", "because that little, old, shriveled guy on a cane was transforming himself into this 20-foot beast and i didn\u2019t even understand the language", "i was like, that\u2019s cool, to entertain a crowd with a point of view", "where was that experience relative to your time in kenya", "that was after kenya", "i\u2019m also on the board of directors for an organization called the school for field studies, which is a great organization out of salem, massachusetts, which basically trains mostly college students to go abroad and into sensitive environmental areas and do environmental studies", "when i was a young teenager, i worked at the new york city aquarium in coney island, which was right next to my neighborhood in brooklyn", "one of the big perks of that job, besides being at the aquarium, was that if you wore the aquarium t-shirt, you got to go on the cyclone rollercoaster over and over again", "so we used to go 40, 50 times in a row on the cyclone", "but i picked up a book for the school for field studies there", "it was just this little color catalog", "i was like wow, they sent kids to kenya and i was like, \u201cma, this is what i want to do", "dad.\u201d somehow they took a few high school students", "i was in advanced biology, so i had a little bit \u2013 i was always good in science", "my dad was a science teacher, so i was always pointed in that direction a bit", "i got them to let me go to kenya, where i studied water strategies and ungulates", "the next year, i went to alaska with them to prince william sound, actually where that big exxon spill was, but i was there two years before that", "which was fascinating because the research we did there actually they used that research after the spill to see what the impact was", "but in alaska, i studied thermal regulation in harbor seals", "i just like to say these words because they\u2019re fancy sounding", "ungulates", "ungulates", "tell us what would fall into the class of ungulates", "all animals that stand on their hooves", "so everything from cattle, domesticated cattle, to zebra, gazelle, wildebeest", "deer and elk", "there were no deer or elk", "there might have been some type of elk there", "that\u2019s right", "i guess there would be caribou in alaska", "it was interesting", "we basically were there", "we were on this ranch owned by an afrikaner who wanted to \u2013 he did this thing called preservation for profit", "where basically he was like, \u201clook, during a drought, all the cattle die, but indigenous animals, of course, don\u2019t die because they basically forage in the morning when there\u2019s dew on the leaves and in the mid-afternoon, they\u2019re in the shade", "basically what we were there to do is to prove his idea that indigenous animals were better adapted to the environment than domesticated animals, which is completely obvious, but in science, you have to prove it", "so we studied them morphologically, which was biologically, and then we also looked at them and their behavior patterns during the day", "it was fascinating because basically we just use \u2013 i learned the scientific method and we did real, serious research and real charting", "the next year was alaska when i went to prince william sound", "the beauty of that was the textbook", "the only textbook we had was origin of species", "every two days, we had to read another chapter of origin of species and discuss it", "over the six, seven weeks i was out in the bush, that was the whole class", "i had read that your time \u2013 this was acting as a field biologist or doing field biology in kenya changed how you looked at the word", "i don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, so i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s accurate or not", "but if that is true, how did it change how you looked at things", "everything in your life changes all the time", "but back at that age, when you\u2019re 16 and you\u2019re a brooklyn kid from new york city who\u2019s basically a concrete jungle flea and you\u2019re suddenly in the savannah of kenya, of course, it\u2019s going to change your life", "it\u2019s a little bit of an overstatement, i think", "but every day was mind-blowing", "as an embarrassing moment \u2013 when i was 16, so you have to forgive me \u2013 i got off the plane and i was riding with the professors to the thing", "i was like, \u201coh, when are we going to see tigers?\u201d they\u2019re like, \u201cthere aren\u2019t any tigers in africa, they\u2019re in asia.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201coh.\u201d so that\u2019s what i meant", "so i was a kid from brooklyn with no idea what was going on", "every day literally was something i had never seen before", "then in alaska \u2013 this is a pre-google, pre-crazy media age, still only 11 channels on the station", "a couple of people had cable", "but early days of civilization", "i remember we were kayaking", "it was an amazing trip", "it was five weeks in kayaks out in prince william sound, one of the most untouched places on the planet, at that point, until exxon showed up", "we were going to this glacier", "i had never seen a glacier", "now everyone\u2019s seen a glacier at this point because of the calving ice and what\u2019s happening to the glaciers", "but the idea of blue ice, for a kid from brooklyn", "this chineka glacier, the first time i saw it, it was two miles long, half a mile tall", "there were huge chunks of ice falling", "you\u2019d see the chunks fall off and then a minute later you\u2019d hear the sound because of the distance like at a ballpark", "then these huge waves from that start coming at you", "you\u2019re in a kayak so you\u2019re really close to the water", "on those waves are icebergs with seals hauled out, regulating their temperature on it, going up and down", "i mean, who needs psychedelics", "you\u2019ve been called controversial", "i don\u2019t know if you view yourself that way", "but i\u2019d love to talk a little bit about how to respond to public perception and criticism", "another mutual friend of ours, rick rubin, fantastic guy, incredible music producer, among other things", "the greatest", "yeah", "he has said on this podcast, i\u2019m paraphrasing, but \u201cthe best art divides the audience.\u201d i think it was \u2013 help me out here \u2013 i think it was variety, the day after you got a 30-minute standing ovation and said you should quit filmmaking and go to therapy instead", "you\u2019ve had, as anybody who is in the public arena has, a fair amount of criticism of various types", "what would your advice be to a filmmaker you think is very promising who is doing something that doesn\u2019t fit cleanly in the widget factory", "they\u2019re probably going to catch fire, but they haven\u2019t had the experience", "what would you say to a person like that", "that\u2019s an easy answer", "keep going", "that\u2019s what you want", "when i meet, when i teach \u2013 both my parents were teachers and so it\u2019s in the blood and i love teaching \u2013 the thing i try to instill in students is the only thing you have to offer is you, your individual stories, your individual perception, your individual humanity", "figuring out a way to communicate that humanity to humanity at large", "that\u2019s the beauty of cinema, once again", "that you can have a 6-year-old iranian girl or a 90-year-old british gentleman and you can have an equally emotional experience if the filmmaker does their job right to it", "for me, it would be a ballerina and a wrestler", "can i make you feel their blood and their pain", "that\u2019s the goal", "because that\u2019s one of the great thing cinema does is to bring us into other human experiences", "if it\u2019s truthful to who you are and you\u2019re concerned about how people are going to react to it, stick up your middle finger and charge straight into that fire if you have to", "if you\u2019re trying to be a provocateur just to be a provocateur, go after yourself", "that, to me, is the bad stuff", "like when it\u2019s not real", "for me, it\u2019s never like, oh shit, how do i mess around with people", "that\u2019s not why i make movies at all", "i\u2019m just juiced about these ideas", "they have nothing about being confrontational", "but even when i do a film like the fountain \u2013 which has been called a love poem to death \u2013 i piss people off", "even though it\u2019s really a gentle, romantic movie about a guy coming to terms with dying", "i guess that\u2019s just not a very commercial idea in the west", "but i thought it was at the time", "i was dancing around for five years, telling studios that people would be interested in the movie because i really believed it", "i\u2019m not interested", "i happen to be a filmmaker who wants to talk to audiences", "i love it", "i love when they respond", "unfortunately, i haven\u2019t done a comedy or something that\u2019s easier to connect with an audience", "not easier to make, by any means", "i just mean when you\u2019re aiming to please an audience, it\u2019s a lot easier to make it than when you\u2019re just making something that you feel inside", "for me, it\u2019s not a conscious thing", "it\u2019s purely from my gut", "that\u2019s the core for me", "it comes from my stomach, always", "it\u2019s not the heart", "it might be somewhere between", "i don\u2019t know, what\u2019s right here", "solar plexus", "it\u2019s right beneath the solar plexus", "it\u2019s kind of the stomach, i guess", "it\u2019s like your large intestine", "oh, great", "[crosstalk] \u2013 it\u2019s that area", "when i\u2019m writing and it\u2019s coming out of there, i know it\u2019s some time of qi energy from there", "do you pay a lot of attention to your kinesthetic response to what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re writing", "i mean, it\u2019s that unconscious state where you\u2019re not feeling the body", "that\u2019s the state to get into", "where it\u2019s just coming out of you", "by no means is that often", "i believe there are writers out there \u2013 i know some real writers and i think they get into that state a lot easier", "i\u2019m not a real writer, but sometimes i have ideas that i want to get out and express, so i try to do it", "why did you say you\u2019re not a real writer", "there are people who would argue if you have writing credits, that you are a writer", "right", "i don\u2019t know", "i guess i\u2019m in awe of \u2013 i have some friends that really write and i see the way they can put words together", "look, the reality \u2013 i\u2019m being more truthful with ferriss than i\u2019ve been with probably anyone \u2013 the reality is i was a public school kid from brooklyn and they never really taught me how to write", "when i got to college, i went into the creative writing class and i almost flunked out of it because i really did not know how to write an essay", "to this day, my 11-year-old son knows more about pronouns and nouns and sentence structure", "i just never learned grammar", "it was never taught to me", "it was a shame", "i just never did the remedial", "so i probably have some type of insecurity about that because i don\u2019t think i could write that", "i can write dialogue because i have an ear and i do have some ideas that i can try to sketch out, but i don\u2019t really \u2013 i guess i\u2019m scared you\u2019re going to give me an essay to write because that\u2019s going to be a challenging one", "i\u2019m going to be the last person to give you an essay to write", "my writing of my senior thesis in college, which was mandatory, and it constitutes a huge part of your departmental grade for the entire time that you\u2019re at school, traumatized me so much that i pledged to myself when i graduated i would never write anything longer than an email ever again", "clearly, it did not work out", "it worked out, but it didn\u2019t work out as planned", "what was your thesis on", "my thesis was on the phonetic and semantic acquisition of chinese characters in the japanese language, called kanji, by native english speakers", "so how do native english speakers most effectively acquire both the meaning and pronunciation of chinese characters", "unbelievable", "yeah", "in retrospect", "it doesn\u2019t seem like someone who\u2019s afraid of writing would write something like that", "that\u2019s pretty \u2013 you know, a lot of my true interests were buried in some of these early writing projects, or even scientific assignments that i then felt were trivial or not serious for some reason and now i\u2019m coming back to them 20 years later", "amazing", "i remember i took a neuroscience class", "initially, the plan was to be a neuroscience major", "i actually was a psychology major focusing on neuroscience", "for a host of reasons, i moved to language acquisition, namely, principally i couldn\u2019t do the animal testing that was required to be part of the lab i wanted to be part of", "good for you", "i will say i understand the sensitivity of the subject", "i do think some studies are very difficult to do or impossible to do without certain animal modeling", "i\u2019ve been deep into this", "no, i know you are", "[crosstalk] no, not for environmental reasons", "i have \u2013 well, we\u2019ll talk about it later", "no, we can definitely talk about it", "i was really fascinated by rem sleep and some of the physiological similarities to states that can be induced with hallucinogens", "so this was probably my sophomore year in college that i was really fascinated by this", "it only took 25 years to come back to it full circle", "did you ever try to stay awake for a long time", "i stayed awake \u2013 and this is not advisable at all \u2013 i wanted to \u2013 i love the disclaimer", "well, because every once in a while i\u2019ll get an email from somebody, like \u201cmy cousin tried what you said and he gave himself a headache.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cyeah, you got to use your common sense, people.\u201d i stayed awake for six days", "i wanted to see what would happen", "i had read these reports of people having all sorts of odd phenomena crop up when you stay awake for that period of time", "i used stimulants, nothing illegal", "but i was very going at putting together these cocktails for myself and stayed awake for five and a half, six days", "i stopped because i was walking on campus \u2013 i remember very clearly where i was", "i was \u2013 and you were naked", "no, i wasn\u2019t naked", "there were goblins everywhere", "no, i fell asleep while i was walking and woke up about a block later", "i had crossed two or three streets", "i was like, you know what", "this is no longer a good idea", "have you stayed awake for a really long period of time", "no", "there was a test when i was an undergrad and my roommate did it where he basically, to stay awake", "he just became cruel", "i remember him telling me", "he was like, \u201ci\u2019m going to go to sleep.\u201d they\u2019re like, \u201cdon\u2019t go to sleep.\u201d he took a deck of cards and started throwing cards around the room and made everyone run around and pick them up; otherwise, he would go to sleep", "so he started really messing with the aides and the grad students that were doing the studies on him", "of course, the overnighter and those are important, not just when you\u2019re in college and stuff", "i\u2019m glad you are out there exploring it for us", "the conclusion is, don\u2019t do that", "if you remove sleep and food from people, they get really grumpy, it turns out", "this is a quote from new york magazine", "this may have been from a while ago", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s that old, actually", "\u201ci think when i was starting out as a filmmaker, i had tremendous focus, but i don\u2019t think i robbed myself of too much life", "i\u2019m still friends with the guys i grew up with nursery school", "i have a great relationship with my family", "i\u2019m definitely attracted to balance to symmetry", "i\u2019m definitely an order personality, but i\u2019m a lot less ordered than i was.\u201d god damn, i said some stupid shit", "you can definitely deny", "you can correct", "you can set the record straight", "it\u2019s all right", "this is of incredible interest to me because many people who would aspire to be creative or who self-describe as creative, wear themselves out", "they sacrifice family, relationships by being singularly focused", "sometimes they\u2019re proud of it; sometimes they regret it", "but this is something that i don\u2019t hear very often", "i was wondering if you could just elaborate on that", "how do you have the tremendous focus required to do what you\u2019ve done while still having that balance and symmetry", "it is a balancing act", "but i think all the time you put into life, into family and into friends, and into activities outside of the work, back to i\u2019ll procrastinate \u2013 not to say time with your family is procrastination \u2013 but bringing in those other experiences into your life is what makes you be able to relate to people and to communicate", "at least, for filmmaking, that\u2019s a major part", "going to a diner with friends and seeing an argument between some strangers over there ends up in a movie for me", "living life and seeing stuff and doing all different types of experiences through this planet is important to being a storyteller because it\u2019s all about the stories", "i think the first three or four films of my career and definitely all my short films before that, all came out of very personal experiences of my life", "the problem is if you keep working nonstop and you\u2019re originating your material \u2013 i think it\u2019s different if you\u2019re more of a journeyman who\u2019s going along and then just taking your craft and bringing it to life, bringing a great script to life", "what do you mean by that, \u201cas a journeyman?\u201d something that\u2019s not a personal story by nature", "i think every story is personal or you can find a personal way because anytime you portray a character on screen, you should sort of infuse them with real emotions and stuff", "to do that, you have to feel it yourself", "but if you\u2019re drawing on your own life and your own stories and you\u2019re somehow more autobiographical somehow, even through metaphor", "i think all my films are not \u2013 i\u2019m not a ballerina, yet there\u2019s a lot of natalie in me", "i mean, that character, nina, in me", "not natalie, but nina, the character", "i\u2019m not a wrestler, but randy the ram i\u2019m pretty connected to and i understand why he makes every decision", "some of those stories in there i can relate to or are drawn from my own life", "i think if it\u2019s an assignment where you\u2019re just showing up as a director and you\u2019re there to make all the departments work together and make the actors do it, i think it becomes more of a craft then", "not to say that it\u2019s not an art, but i think if you\u2019re trying to create your own stories that are coming out of life, you have to actually live life to do it", "otherwise, you\u2019re just getting your stories \u2013 i don\u2019t know where you could get your stories from", "i guess you could make things about being an obsessive filmmaker", "which is kind of like one of my favorite filmmakers, fellini started making films about directors making films", "[crosstalk] eventually he went off into other things, but for a while, that\u2019s what he worked on", "i think you have to balance it in this art form", "it\u2019s very different, i think, in different forms because other forms can be expressed in different ways", "i can\u2019t really speak to that, but storytelling, you need stories", "it reminds me of something i was told at one point, which helped me at least, which was a friend of mine, a writer, i think it was either debbie millman or maria popova", "they said, \u201cif art imitates life, you have to have a life.\u201d i guess my follow-up question is, when you are really immersed in a project, and maybe now with family and so on it\u2019s different than in the early days, but my experience and part of the risk i have when i go into a project is that it tends to crowd out other things", "do you schedule time with friends and family so that they don\u2019t get displaced", "how do you ensure that happens", "or are you just programmed in such a way that it\u2019s natural", "it\u2019s not a bad life as a filmmaker because basically, at least the way my schedule is, i do a film every two, three years", "in that two, three years, there will be like a 50, 60-day run which will be completely selfish and completely committed and dedicated to the film, where i\u2019m working 18, 20-hour days over and over again", "an insane amount of time", "you get one day off on the weekend and then the next day you\u2019re probably prepping", "although i\u2019m able now to almost get two days off because i\u2019ve been doing it enough that i kind of have more skills that i can go in", "so i can get a weekend off sometimes where i can spend with family and friends", "not that i could go out and party and have a beer", "it\u2019s got to be very mellow", "most of the time, i\u2019ll just want to watch game of thrones", "but that\u2019s a huge marathon that only happens once every two, three years", "then you get into editing and it\u2019s basically a 9:00 to 5:00 job", "there\u2019s always things coming up, but it\u2019s a much slower pace", "that could be a 40-week process", "then you get to selling the film, which is kind of a two, three week kind of marathon of travel, but it\u2019s kind of fun because that\u2019s where a lot of stories come from because you see all these different cultures and you just see a lot of crazy shit", "it\u2019s not that bad", "then i get into development", "when i\u2019m in development for the next project, once again, i can really shape that around my son\u2019s schedule and i can have time to see my friends and have experiences and travel and stuff like that", "because when you\u2019re developing, it\u2019s all virtual in your head", "not quite in a computer, but it\u2019s all in your imagination for a while", "all you need is a notepad and a pen and you could be anywhere", "are there any particular resources \u2013 and i\u2019m sure this is a question you\u2019ve had a lot, so i apologize in advance, but i haven\u2019t heard the answer \u2013 to aspiring filmmakers", "let\u2019s just assume intelligent, driven, organized", "so a big assumption, but let\u2019s just assume they check those three boxes", "sure", "are there any particular books or resources or approaches that you would suggest they take", "assuming that they want to put together some type of narrative storytelling, not doing a documentary", "i always push the writer\u2019s journey by christopher vogler", "it\u2019s very good", "but it\u2019s only for people who are writing screenplays", "but he\u2019s great", "he basically took joseph campbell\u2019s work and turned it into screenplay language", "he did a really good job at it", "we\u2019re totally part of his cult", "because i believe in that hero\u2019s journey", "not to say that\u2019s the end all to end all and there are other ways to approach it, but it\u2019s a very interesting structure that can really lead to big breakthroughs", "when you\u2019re struggling, you can look at the different archetypes that there are and often you find yourself falling into it", "it\u2019s funny, like requiem for a dream, when i was working on it, it was before i read vogler", "but now that i look back, i was doing stuff similarly, where i was charting out where the characters\u2019 emotions were", "what was interesting was that the graph was actually upside down", "when something good was supposed to happen, something bad was happening", "i was looking at it and one day i flipped it over and i said, \u201coh", "they\u2019re actually the bad guys, all my characters", "the good guy is addiction and this is actually a hero\u2019s journey of addiction overcoming the human spirit.\u201d that\u2019s when i finally understood what the movie was about", "charting it and using hero\u2019s journey is how i was able to figure that idea out that this invisible monster, this craving, was actually the hero of the film", "but that\u2019s great", "then the other thing back on what we talked about is to tell your story", "don\u2019t try to figure out what people want because the reality is \u2013 and i kind of learned this", "when i was coming out of film school, i went to support my friend, scott silver, who is a big screenwriter now", "he had directed a film that was at sundance and it was the year that welcome to the dollhouse was there and a bunch of other indie gems", "i remember watching these films and going, these are such specific, unique movies, but they\u2019re done exquisitely well", "what sundance allowed me to believe and what independent film has allowed so many dreamers to believe is that if you make a film well, no matter how personal it is, if it\u2019s truthful, you\u2019ll find an audience", "not to invoke the name of rick again, but i was having a conversation with rick recently in a barrel sauna that is the exact replica of his barrel sauna, and we were talking about this deadline that i continually \u2013 i\u2019m actually working hard on the book", "give yourself a break, man", "i spend a lot of time talking about how hard i\u2019m working on the book", "i was asking him some questions about working with musicians and whether he knows if something has hit the mark or not", "i\u2019m going to paraphrase here, but he said effectively, \u201cgreat is always better than now.\u201d the way i interpreted that was there\u2019s always a good time for great, there\u2019s never a good time for mediocre", "so if you feel like you rushed to hit some kind of a deadline \u2013 obviously there are realities of production and so on, don\u2019t get me wrong", "yeah, you can\u2019t rush", "rick\u2019s filled with wisdom", "it always comes out so interesting", "i get that", "you can\u2019t force it", "the thread i want to tease a little bit, which is something you mentioned earlier, which is the argument between the strangers in the diner that then makes it into your movie", "could you tell me about your history with the game of go", "i got into it a lot when i was doing pi", "i needed a game for the two guys to be playing so that they had some reason that they were meeting so that max and his mentor could meet", "i just thought playing chess was just \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it so much and it\u2019s clich\u00e9 and mathematicians playing chess was just not quite interesting enough", "at that point in \u201997, go was still very much a fringe game", "sort of is, still", "but i think it was much more fringe then", "we used to go a lot to the new york go chapter meetings, which were like 18 very intellectual people in very book-lined apartments at different houses each week playing go", "it was a great cast of characters", "the best thing about go characters are the ones that blow off chess as a fool\u2019s game", "they so look down on chess", "it\u2019s just such a chip on their shoulder that they\u2019ve graduated to go", "another thing that\u2019s fascinating that i\u2019ve been hearing a lot of people \u2013 i think actually rick was talking to me about it, that\u2019s where i heard it", "well, he\u2019s the one who suggested i ask you", "oh, there you go", "he told me there was some documentary about what it meant, this computer finally beating these go masters", "he was telling me about a scene where after the first move, the go master gets up and walks away because basically, i guess the point was that it\u2019s such a radical way to change how the game is played \u2013 how this computer is playing it, that it\u2019s actually affecting now how humans play each other", "that\u2019s a line about ai that is interesting", "where it actually changes the way we act with each other after thousands of years of playing a game a certain way, suddenly this idea comes that is a moment of genius that changes the way we look at the board", "that was an interesting idea", "and that\u2019s from a documentary", "i believe so, but you have to ask rick", "[crosstalk] i\u2019ll ask rick", "it fascinated me", "i\u2019ve been thinking about it since", "i don\u2019t want to take us totally off the rails", "do you play go", "i have a go board at my house", "i am not good", "i tend to play a highbrow version of connect 5, which is connect 5", "my brother and i love to play", "we just call it connect 5 or something like that, where we use a go board", "it seems really childish, but my brother, he\u2019s a statistics ph.d", "and a very good chess player", "these games can actually last a really long time", "so it\u2019s just basically getting five in a row and you can place them anywhere on the board", "sounds great", "yeah", "it can take a long time", "you don\u2019t flip tiles or anything", "it\u2019s just about blocking each other", "that\u2019s right", "you leave them there", "you\u2019re not capturing \u2013 well, you are capturing territory, but the rules are completely different from real go", "yeah, my son came home from math class with that on paper and we played it for a while", "i was like wow, this is a complicated game", "super complicated", "go is so fascinating on many levels", "one of which is you can feel like you\u2019re winning and effectively, if your pattern recognition is off, in a handful of moves, completely lose", "the tide can turn a lot faster", "i shouldn\u2019t say this with any degree of credibility because i know people like josh waitzkin are actually going to check", "the game i got really into in japan \u2013 my first trip abroad was a year in japan as an exchange student at a japanese school", "i lived with a japanese family", "i listened to the session you did with the knifemaker", "it was fascinating", "oh yeah, murray carter", "murray\u2019s amazing", "i want to get some of his knives, actually", "his knives are incredible", "you should", "they\u2019re so good", "the muteki line \u2013 his stuff is amazing", "the game i got into was called shogi", "shogi is japanese chess", "what makes japanese chess different \u2013 and there are ways you can play western chess this way \u2013 but you\u2019re able to re-use the captured pieces and just drop them on the board at different places", "then also, not only do pawns get promoted, there are multiple pieces that turn into completely different pieces when they get \u2013 [crosstalk]\u00a0 very cool", "it\u2019s like the pok\u00e9mon of chess", "yeah, it\u2019s really a cool game", "i used to buy these books in japan", "sumaishogi", "sumaishogi is, think of a really slow app, it\u2019s a book where you try to figure out the three or four moves in a given position necessary to win the game", "then there\u2019s an answer key", "on the subway \u2013 because you spend a lot of time on the subway in tokyo, at least i did \u2013 i would either read comic books or i would look at these sumaishogi or i would read judo textbooks", "you do judo", "yeah", "as an aside, it\u2019s funny", "it was very upsetting when they got wifi on the new york city subway because now i have to work hard", "but my rule is to never take out your phone", "not because i\u2019m worried about it getting stolen or anything, but just because that\u2019s the chance to watch people for me", "you don\u2019t want to get lost in your device at that point", "that\u2019s a great time", "the rule in new york is great", "basically, you can stare at anyone you want", "if they make eye contact with you, you can never look at them again", "but you\u2019re allowed to look as long as they don\u2019t look at you", "people come to new york and i say, that\u2019s a rule", "you can watch and check each other out, but if they realize they\u2019re being checked out, stop", "i find it fascinating", "i imagine the subways in japan must be insane", "what shocked me \u2013 there are so many things that are so alien about japan for someone who hasn\u2019t been exposed to japan, specifically, even in east asia", "i\u2019ve spent time in china", "i\u2019ve gone to school there", "i\u2019ve spent time in taiwan", "i\u2019ve spent time in japan", "japan and within japan, tokyo is just a particular brand of weird", "you get on the subway and i remember a couple of things really striking me", "because i\u2019m 15, everything is backward, right", "we\u2019re driving on the opposite side of the street", "we have to take a shower before we get into the bath", "all these rules that seem very alice in wonderland, topsy-turvy", "then i sit down on the subway and see these salarymen, who are on their way to work, these worker bees", "they\u2019re reading comic books with the most explicit porn imaginable", "they\u2019re completely nonchalant about it", "alien porn", "yeah, tentacle porn, who knows", "then the other hilarious phenomenon i bumped to which i really didn\u2019t expect \u2013 you hear about in japan perverts on the subways", "there are definitely perverts on the subways and they\u2019re called chikan", "so if you hear chikan, chikan, that means a pervert \u2013 [crosstalk] oh, really", "so if some guy is trying to fondle some girl\u2019s ass, you\u2019ll hear \u201cchikan\u201d and then there\u2019s a big kerfuffle", "what they don\u2019t tell you is that \u2013 i remember one day, i was in my \u2013 you just put chikan and kerfuffle in one sentence", "just so you know", "it might be the first time ever", "the singularity is near", "i was in my school uniform, 15", "clearly a high school student", "i have my judo uniform over my shoulder", "it\u2019s wrapped up", "i\u2019m standing up", "it was a packed subway", "i feel someone groping my ass", "i\u2019m like, what is going on here", "i can\u2019t turn around because it\u2019s so crowded", "eventually i\u2019m able to turn around and what do i see", "not what i expect", "i see two really old women with half of their teeth capped in gold, chuckling to themselves because they\u2019d been grabbing my ass", "these women are called obatalian", "obatalian is from \u201cold battalion,\u201d but it refers to older japanese women who just don\u2019t give a fuck anymore", "it was a real cultural experience", "my favorite, when i went to japan for the first time, which was with pi, i was a huge fan of \u2013 i dreamt for so long to go to tokyo", "i wanted to make a statement here", "i want to be remembered", "i\u2019m coming with this little film, what can i do", "so i dyed my hair purple", "i came and i\u2019m doing interviews the whole time with big, bright purple hair and no one mentions it", "i get to my last interview and it\u2019s kind of a young, hip guy who\u2019s a pop star in japan and we become buddies", "i\u2019m like, \u201cman, you know, i\u2019ve made my hair purple, but no one\u2019s commenting on it.\u201d he goes, \u201chere, come to the window.\u201d we look outside and it\u2019s a major intersection", "he says, \u201cwho has purple hair out there?\u201d all the old ladies dye their hair purple", "that\u2019s true", "i\u2019m like, oh", "oops", "that\u2019s totally true", "100% accurate", "ohmygod, i didn\u2019t fuse those together", "that\u2019s true", "i\u2019m having flashbacks", "i think the old ladies who were grabbing my ass had purple hair", "just so you know, in requiem for a dream, they dyed their hair red and out there it\u2019s purple", "so very funny", "so speaking of tentacle porn, that\u2019s about as graceful a segue as i can make", "we don\u2019t have to talk about this if you don\u2019t want to, but this is one of the bullets that was recommended for me to talk to you about", "i should preface this by saying, in my second book, the 4-hour body, there are two chapters on female orgasm, two on various aspects of male sexuality, so i\u2019m not shy about talking about this, but \u2013 suddenly, i\u2019m on the howard stern show", "suddenly, you\u2019re on the howard stern show", "restricting ejaculation", "i don\u2019t have any context for this", "but i was told to ask you about restricting ejaculation", "wow, where\u2019d you get that from", "my sources cannot be named", "is that something that you can tell us about", "i\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referencing", "oh, i think, oh, there we go", "it\u2019s coming back to me", "it was funny", "in requiem for a dream, there\u2019s something in the background called month of fury", "i guess it was early self-help", "wow, this is going way back", "it actually kind of flows a little bit into probably why a growing friendship is happening here because we have similar roots in a certain way", "when i was in film school \u2013 and this is another great thing for young film students to know is there\u2019s usually the first screenplay you write that will never get made", "believe me, that happens", "at a certain point, you have to take the bold step to abandon it, because there\u2019s a learning process in that first script", "i worked on a script that was set in coney island", "i had a guy, a really talented kid i grew up with who probably if he went to wall street would be a hundred millionaire type of guy", "he ended up getting involved in this kind of cult organization that are those guys who go around and sell roses and little toys around the streets wearing ties", "i don\u2019t know if you ever see them", "there are a lot on the west coast", "they\u2019re basically pyramid schemes where you basically open up an office and you hire ten 20-year-old kids and they go and hustle for you", "you buy it from a guy above you", "then if you get a few, you slowly move up", "they have these huge conventions in vegas where they all come together and they have all these chants where they juice each other up and get all excited", "when i was in film school, he was in the west coast area", "i just sort of studied it and hung out with him", "once again, here\u2019s another hang out with a friend but also kind of get stories", "so i developed this whole kind of characters are world for this move about this", "eventually i didn\u2019t make that film, but i was able to take that character when i had to bring hubert selby jr.\u2019s requiem for a dream alive", "sarah goldfarb, the old lady, watched a lot of tv", "but we couldn\u2019t afford the tv to put tv on the channel, so i decided to make my own tv show and create kind of a tony robbins-esque \u2013 because tony was just starting", "he didn\u2019t evolve into the kind of figure he is now", "now one really knew what it was", "it was odd", "so i created my own version of that and had this guy on tv", "i had to give him a philosophy", "i had an actor friend who was also a boxer and he had this thing called month of fury", "eddie deharp is his name", "there were three roles, which are actually three great rules", "it was 30 days no refined sugar", "30 days no red meat", "30 days no orgasm", "were those all together", "yeah, you do all three for a month, for 30 days", "it was actually very interesting", "he preached it to me because he would do it before he would box", "one more time", "no refined sugar", "no refined sugar, so that\u2019s everything, like toothpaste, anywhere there could be sugar", "no red meat, and then no orgasm", "so in the movie, requiem for a dream, the third one is not actually pitched because i just thought it would be good as a little secret", "now i\u2019m giving it away", "it\u2019s actually in there, but it\u2019s an easter egg that\u2019s hidden in the film somewhere", "it was funny because when we started working on it, i suggested to the actors that they should go on a month of fury before we make the movie, just to understand what it is to withdraw, which is a big part of the movie", "it\u2019s hard if you\u2019re not a drug addict or a smoker to actually stop something for 30 days", "to fast, as you talked about", "it\u2019s really tricky", "here with three things that were seemingly not hard to do", "\u00a0it was funny to see my actors at day 24 and 25 wanting to kill me", "hence the month of fury", "i have another friend, my best buddy, who actually on day 29, ended up proposing to a woman", "i was like, you never propose on day 29", "what are you, out of your freaking mind", "the month of fury", "the month of fury", "if i ever did self-help, that would be \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so hey if you want to co-write it and start a movement, i know you got \u2013 [crosstalk] \u00a0the month of fury", "all right", "you heard it here first, folks", "i think i could get quite a few people to participate in the month of fury", "it\u2019s actually very effective", "i\u2019d like to ask quite a few questions about the new film", "but the first is related to the writing of the film", "when you are writing a film like mother", "and there are many \u2013 and i don\u2019t want to give anything away \u2013 but many visual components, how do you write that type of material", "being the writer and then the director, i can not worry about that much", "but there are two different steps", "first you\u2019re writing and you\u2019re following along the emotional truth of the characters and following scene-by-scene what\u2019s going on and watching the story unfold", "then there\u2019s the next stage", "at a certain point, you hang up most of your writing cap because you can always re-write if you\u2019re the writer", "but then you start to become the director and start to think about blocking and movement", "that was a very big deal in this film", "can you define blocking for people who don\u2019t know what it is", "yeah, sure", "blocking is basically just how actors move in a scene", "that\u2019s all it is", "but it\u2019s really truly a big part of the work for a lot of reasons", "first, you want to create blocking that\u2019s organic and natural to what the actors are doing in the scene", "you want to make sure whatever the actor\u2019s doing makes sense with what their objective is in the scene, or what they\u2019re doing in the scene, or what they\u2019re not doing in the scene, or what they\u2019re hiding in the scene", "you want to think about what that is all about", "then, there\u2019s a second tier, which is as the filmmaker, you\u2019re trying to make it as economical as possible, meaning as few setups, as few times to move the camera as possible because every time you have to sort of change where the camera is, you have to change the lighting and that just takes time", "you want to get as much time shooting as possible", "you\u2019re trying to figure out blocking what works best for the simplest amount of technical problems", "unless you\u2019re really trying to do something technically super challenging and stuff", "you try to balance those", "it\u2019s kind of a balance because sometimes you\u2019ll tell the actor, \u201ccan you help me out here with blocking?\u201d because it means we have to do less", "but sometimes you don\u2019t want to get in their way and you want them to be creatively free so you want to give them an open playground to play around in where they can do and move", "it\u2019s a balancing act", "but it\u2019s a big part of it", "at a certain point, when the script is done, and in the case of mother!, i was actually lucky enough to have a three-and-a-half month rehearsal period, where basically i convinced jennifer lawrence and javier bardem and michelle pfeiffer and ed harris to join me in a warehouse out in east brooklyn, where we basically taped out the set", "we would work on the scenes and then we\u2019d get up on our feet and we would just start to block them", "in the last two weeks of that three-and-a-half-month-long process, i actually brought in my cameraman and we shot the entire movie, moving the camera around, on video, as homework", "which was really fascinating because you figure out all different types of problems, like how\u2019s the camera going to get from \u2013 it\u2019s a constant, moving, handheld camera", "so how am i going to get the camera from here to there because there\u2019s a wall there", "that suddenly started to play into action", "this film, it was a very restricted visual language that was part of one of the challenges i put in front of myself", "normally, you\u2019ll have a wide shot in a movie", "the nice thing about a wide shot is if an actor somehow does something that\u2019s dramatically new, emotionally new, or if they decide to comb their hair a different way in each take, if you go out to a wide shot, basically the illusion is broken for a moment because the viewers\u2019 eyes have to take in more or a different part of scene or there\u2019s other things to look at", "so that when you pop back into a closeup, you can get away cheap almost with what\u2019s happening and no one would ever notice", "in the case of my film, since there were no wide shots, it was extremely challenging", "the only shots in the film are either over jennifer lawrence\u2019s shoulder, on jennifer lawrence\u2019s face, or her point of view, which means what she\u2019s looking at", "that\u2019s the only coverage in the entire film", "so that\u2019s why this edit has been almost a year-long cut", "because i had such a limited amount of language to work with", "i had to make every moment by moment by moment work, even though that\u2019s not really happening in real time", "why did you choose to use that constraint", "i feel like i could talk to you about constraints and rules for a really long time", "because you mentioned \u2013 the month of fury", "yeah, the month of fury, exactly", "just get progressively more belligerent", "you talked about having lunch scheduled for after a difficult meeting", "then you have shooting over max\u2019s shoulder and different ways of, as you put it, limiting your visual palette", "why do that", "i think starting as an independent filmmaker with very limited resources makes you strategically figure out economical means to basically take advantage of all the limited resources you have", "i ended up actually stylistically creating techniques that actually turn those limited economics into a stylistic choice", "i\u2019ve always been preaching that boundaries are the most important thing in any form of an art", "when you\u2019re a painter, you have the boundaries of a canvas and the limitation of your colors", "i think it\u2019s extremely important to do the same in filmmaking", "to make real choices about how you want to do those limits", "sometimes they\u2019re self-imposed", "i have less of the economic issues, although always you have to be very economically responsible for what you\u2019re doing", "but i went really extreme on this film", "i basically said, there\u2019s three shots for every scene, which is an incredibly low amount of shots than i would normally do in a movie", "it just became an interesting exercise and experiment",

noticed that", "which is crazy because when we\u2019re doing crowd scenes with lots of people, it would be a lot easier to tell the story by having jen get lost in the crowd and crowd come through, but no", "my vp, matty, was like, it could be \u2013 we talked about it for a while", "i was like no, let\u2019s just remain orthodox here", "let\u2019s remain truthful to the intent", "the one thing i was worried about, people would feel claustrophobic or bored by the style and that doesn\u2019t seem to be the response", "people aren\u2019t seeing those limitations", "i think that\u2019s because we just turned it into a language and into a style that people can understand", "is there something you hope audiences will respond with or walk out with", "did you have an objective", "this ties into, i suppose, the genesis of the film as well", "i don\u2019t actually know the origin story", "the origin story is hard because it\u2019s murky", "i think it came out of these endless headlines, the endless stream of notifications on your telephone", "the ability to scratch right beneath the surface of our civilization and realize how many desperate and awful things are happening around the planet still in this pretty enlightened time", "there\u2019s a lot of rage and a lot of helplessness", "what can i do", "how can i stop this", "being an environmentalist when we\u2019re completely

know", "i come from a science background", "i witnessed how little, tiny, small changes by man can deeply have huge effects very quickly that are out of control", "then this new idea of these feedback loops, which isn\u2019t that new anymore", "but these ideas that are becoming more idea that there\u2019s these tipping points where things are just going to start to accelerate", "as a parent, i just sit there and i go, oh my gosh", "i look at the beauty of my child and want them to forget about having a job, having a freaking atmosphere and having the ability to \u2013 it\u2019s crazy to ever

prince william sound", "we were kayaking, as i said, for weeks", "i was eating a granola bar and the wrapper fell into the water", "it was like a foil wrapper", "i freaked out", "i stopped", "i tried to \u2013 it just went right under", "because of that guilt of that, i still, when i see trash on a beach, i pick it up for that foil", "that guilt has carried me", "because at that time, it very much felt untouched", "like i was one of the first humans to ever experience it", "there isn\u2019t a place on the planet anymore, not because of pollution only, but because of climate change, that isn\u2019t affected by humans", "there\u2019s nowhere on the planet that is true wilderness as it was 60 years ago", "i was writing a western and i realized \u2013 it was set in 1883, i think \u2013

remnant of humanity would be gone in a century", "completely gone", "because everything was built out of earth materials", "then you suddenly have all these freakish new materials where every single

there still were places on the planet that weren\u2019t feeling any impact", "to now, where it\u2019s all changed", "it\u2019s scary that people are just completely denying it and turning their backs on it", "out of that, i just want to howl", "i felt the ginsburg howl", "i just wanted to howl", "i guess it\u2019s my howl", "what is the ginsburg howl", "allen ginsburg, the poem howl", "you never read that one", "got it", "sorry, i\u2019m betraying my lack of education", "that one you should read", "that one\u2019s great", "but it\u2019s basically, it was a cry from the \u201860s for his generation", "at least that\u2019s the way i took it", "how would you like people to go into the movie", "who should go see the movie", "now, the obvious commercial answer might be everyone",

way", "you should be ready for it", "and no matter how much i prep you, and tim can tell you, it goes there", "right", "yes, yes it does", "it\u2019s intense", "it\u2019s very intense", "if you want an intense, different ride, if you want to see something different at the cinema, please come on down", "that\u2019s what we tried to do is make a very unique rollercoaster", "except it may go off the tracks and into the concrete wall, but i can\u2019t really be \u2013 i don\u2019t want to be responsible for that", "but that sort of happens", "i just want \u2013 i think it works on a lot of levels", "i was always thinking it was going to be really scary and tilting into the horror genre", "jen lawrence, when she saw it, actually thought it was incredibly beautiful and moving", "that there was a beauty to it", "i\u2019ve heard that reflected in a lot of ways", "it\u2019s definitely not your normal night at the movie, but it\u2019s the type of movie you go see and everyone will have something to say about it, i think", "hopefully there are not too many profane words directed in my direction", "well, they could be profane but modifying something good also", "there\u2019s that", "i\u2019d like to ask about the sound", "i have read that \u2013 well, a few things", "that (a) a lot of independent films or films in general fail from poor audio quality", "yeah, that was a big thing i realized very young in my career", "this is a pretty good movie, but something is off", "it was always the sound", "the sound in this movie, and in more than one of your films certainly, is very \u2013 i\u2019m searching for the right words \u2013 but very visceral, very pronounced", "i only read this other expression after the fact, after i saw the movie, but thinking of music or the sound as an additional character", "yeah", "could you elaborate on that", "because i\u2019ve never paid so much attention to sound in a film", "i think it\u2019s \u2013 well, you saw a slightly unfinished \u2013 only the first half of the film was really dialed in", "it\u2019s going to get better, i hope", "that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to be doing as we speak", "sound design for me is a huge tool", "i got totally turned on when i was a young kid", "i saw a documentary on the guys who did the sound design for star wars and they were out in the desert, banging on wires, making light saber sounds", "it blew my mind", "i was like, wow, that\u2019s such a cool idea that you can use any sound to do this and matching up sound and image, you can really mess around", "i\u2019ve always been fascinated by that", "but since i make these films where i really am trying to make the audience have a visceral experience with the character \u2013 in this case, jennifer lawrence\u2019s character \u2013 i try to draw the audience into her subjective point of view by creating a soundscape that starts of realistic, but then as things sort of shift and get more and more insane, it becomes more and more expressive and expressionistic", "i love the fact that people are going to be able to see this in theaters for a lot of reasons", "i want to connect this to something else that i read about you, which relates to the historical lack of compliance to widget making", "the story of you shooting natalie portman for black swan in the subway at something like 3:00 in the morning without necessary permits, without her having signed a contract", "how do you \u2013 and i don\u2019t know as many filmmakers as you do, but i know a few", "how do you get away with it", "meaning you seem to be able \u2013 and this is from the outside looking in \u2013 but to make the art you want to make and bend the rules or do things like that", "why is that", "are there certain contractual decisions or conversations you\u2019ve had that allow you to do it", "did you set the precedent as a problem child early so they\u2019re just like, oh, it\u2019s fucking darren", "so you get away with it", "i mean, it\u2019s just the project", "i don\u2019t think \u2013 it\u2019s never meant to be abusive", "no, i\u2019m not calling it that", "no, but i\u2019m just saying", "i think the reality is it\u2019s not abusive, it\u2019s about the work", "it\u2019s always about the work", "i think if you can relate back to that, this is about us bringing this to life in the best way", "i think there are people that would take that line of argument and turn it into abuse or push the line to something that\u2019s not safe or fair", "i think i\u2019m pretty empathetic to other people\u2019s feelings, maybe to a fault", "because i think some directors, it\u2019s kind of helpful to push past some of that pain and be blind to it, but that\u2019s just not my character", "i can\u2019t do it", "i feel when people are uncomfortable very easily", "it makes me probably better as a director to read performance, but it probably gets me less than what i always need because i feel sorry sometimes", "i have mercy", "how dare you", "i think thought that when it\u2019s the work, you just go for it and people get excited by that", "if you\u2019re actually being truthful about that, but there are times and places where i\u2019ve tried to do too much and people have pointed out to me, hey, that\u2019s probably not fair for these reasons", "i hear that and then i just listen to myself if that\u2019s the truth or not", "if you have that conversation and it doesn\u2019t feel true to you, is that one of the primary causes of walking from potential projects", "i guess all of this is sort of coalescing into a question of, if you were talking to a very promising, new director", "maybe they\u2019re a writer/director, but they direct", "you wanted to prevent them from getting chewed up or corrupted by the system, is there any particular career advise that you would give to them", "it\u2019s a good question", "i mean, you\u2019ve got to be doing it", "i\u2019m always from the school that you\u2019ve got to do it because you have to do it", "but you don\u2019t have any other choice but to do it", "just recently, i ran into a filmmaker and he was complaining and whining about doing a tv show because he really wanted to be making films", "my advice to him was not to stick with your gut and do what you want", "i could tell he was the type of guy that should be doing that tv show because i could see he was already past that point where he had crossed", "i was like, do it", "but then you find people who want to do what they do and you just want to support them and give them as much love and support to get it because they\u2019re trying their hardest to do something that only they can do", "does that mean \u2013 for instance, i\u2019ve heard this advice with writing \u2013 that you should only write a book if it\u2019s easier for you to write the book than to not write the book", "it has to be that much of a compulsion", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever easier to make a movie than not make a movie", "i guess maybe just from a personal, pain/pleasure standpoint", "i remember reading an anecdote, and again, who knows, it\u2019s the internet", "about you, actually, i think this might\u2019ve been from the new yorker, about a diary entry where you were talking about a rave in thailand", "you were like, \u201cthe sun came up and the people were dancing and the people were dancing, and the sun came down and the people were dancing", "the tides went out and i was miserable because i wasn\u2019t making movies.\u201d yeah, that\u2019s true", "that means you have to make movies, right", "i guess so", "i think for me it was storytelling more than films", "although i think there were definitely in my past and experience that helped me", "very early on, i got into photography, into black-and-white photography when i was in junior high school", "i would go into the darkroom and develop the film", "i loved it", "i don\u2019t know why that fell into my lab", "it just so happened they had this lab nearby and i was able to take a class there", "then i just started thinking about photographs and taking pictures and all that", "that all led to this", "i think it could have gone any way", "it\u2019s funny because when i was in college, i didn\u2019t know what i wanted to do", "the first couple years i was in college, i hadn\u2019t discovered filmmaking until i was a junior in college", "i remember walking around, hitting myself in the head going, \u201ci\u2019m never going to find what i want", "i\u2019m never going to find my calling.\u201d then it happens for you, hopefully", "it happened for me", "i found something that \u2013 it was the first time i ever got an a in college was filmmaking", "i was a b- student until film came along", "the suddenly, boom", "it was like something that kept me out of my girlfriend\u2019s room", "i\u2019d rather be cutting the movie than laying in bed", "i found it", "but i think eventually it comes", "but it could\u2019ve been a lot of things", "i don\u2019t think necessarily \u2013 it\u2019s this kind of weird art form", "it could\u2019ve probably come to me in lots of different ways", "it was just something that i was like, okay", "i see a path", "i see something there", "it\u2019s interesting and fascinating and there\u2019s a lot to learn in there", "so i just went for it", "if i were to ask some of your closest friends what your super power is, maybe you wouldn\u2019t talk about it because you seem to be a pretty understated, humble guy", "but what your super power is or what makes you different, what would they say", "what might they say", "i mean, my friend dan, who does visual effects for me, i met him the first day of freshman year of college says, \u201cyou know, if people ask me if you\u2019ve changed, i say, you know what", "he was asshole in college and he\u2019s still an asshole.\u201d that\u2019s what old friends are for", "exactly", "i don\u2019t know", "it\u2019s hard for me to say", "but definitely one of the best things about my life, as i talked about there, is i still hang out with the guys i went to nursery school with", "i still hang out with the guys i went to high school with", "i still hang out with the guys i went to college with", "i think that having the roots \u2013 i\u2019m into roots", "i\u2019m into loyalty", "i work with the same filmmakers, pretty much", "my friend jed once said that \u201cthe guy who dies with the most friends wins.\u201d i thought that was pretty good advice", "if i were to pester your friends a little bit more, give them a few drinks and they get past the obligatory, still an asshole, he\u2019s still an asshole \u2013 if they got to the point of drunk reminiscing and sort of the emotional point of drunkenness", "what would they attribute your success to", "more people don\u2019t make it than make it in the film business", "it\u2019s a good question", "what would you attribute it to", "we can make it direct", "i mean, it\u2019s a combination", "i had excellent parents that almost always supported me and always told me not to work so hard", "not to work too hard", "when i would say, \u201ci got to go work,\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201cwell, don\u2019t work too hard,\u201d was their saying", "that was after i got out of college", "so up to college \u2013 they were both schoolteachers and academics was super important", "but they also created very good responsibility and boundaries, but also didn\u2019t necessarily create opportunities, but gave me breathing room with support to find opportunities", "i struggled in my 20s, but i was able to struggle in my 20s", "that was, i think, a big part, was having that type of support system", "and my sister", "family was a major part of it", "i think that allowed me to have persistence", "which i always say is 9/10ths of the game", "you\u2019ve got to get up to the plate to get that chance, to take that swing", "to get to the plate just takes a lot of work", "then when you get there, it\u2019s preparation and homework", "having done all your homework, as well as you can and as much as you can", "then as you\u2019re taking the swing, make it a responsible swing for the team", "i love the baseball metaphor", "i wonder how much longer i can keep going", "with your students you teach, what is the name of the class", "i don\u2019t do it regularly because i haven\u2019t found the best place", "i taught at nyu for a bit and a few other places", "to be honest, i wing it to see what kids are doing", "i\u2019ll come in", "i\u2019ll talk to them about what their dreams are, what their projects are", "they all share, so i have them all describe each other\u2019s stuff", "i love doing scene study with kids, where i have them put up a scene, work with actors, put up a scene", "now, this is a scene that has already appeared in a film", "no, a scene from their projects", "they describe it to me, they tell me what they want", "they\u2019ll put up the scene and then i\u2019ll give them my direction on how i would block it", "i\u2019ll work with the actors", "i\u2019ll just show them my process", "then i\u2019ll take a chalkboard out and i\u2019ll show them, how do we shoot it", "i\u2019ll draw my designs to show them how to draw it", "and the chalkboard is sort of bird\u2019s-eye view", "it\u2019s always bird\u2019s-eye view", "that\u2019s how i\u2019ve always \u2013 i know other filmmakers do it, but it was when i was 20 years old starting to do films, that\u2019s how i started", "it\u2019s probably from playing dungeons and dragons as a kid", "you get that sky view and i drew little triangles and i came up with all these different shapes and forms", "i have my own language that i\u2019ve developed over the years for how to do it", "i have the ability to look at that architectural plans and then to see it in 3-d below", "that\u2019s how i do it", "i do it very much from a bird\u2019s-eye view", "dungeons and dragons will be for round 2", "i was always a chaotic, good \u2013 you were a cleric", "i was a gray elf", "you were a gray elf", "yeah", "you were a cleric", "no, i don\u2019t remember that well, actually", "we played forever, but i don\u2019t actually remember my characters to well", "i\u2019ll bring some graph paper for next time", "exactly", "if you were to \u2013 this is related to the class \u2013 let\u2019s just say you could no longer make films", "your divinely assigned mission was to coach five to ten filmmakers", "not only would you get the psychic reward of seeing them do well, but much like someone who bankrolls a poker player, you would get a percentage of the future", "what are the things you would focus on if you had a six-month period", "if i was doing that i had a share of it, as soon as you bring the share into it, it\u2019s like, you know", "we could approach this a couple different ways", "one is you get the profit share", "so it\u2019s like a 50/50 split with them, plus you have a kicker, but you have to add some money in", "we could do that", "i would never do that", "film investment is an awful investment", "this is, of course \u2013 that\u2019s what we have huge, chinese companies for", "but the other could be really whatever reward you want to get out of it", "it could be the acclaim and receiving awards and prizes and so on", "it could be anything else", "i mean, really, the gift of any teacher is to see whatever the goals of the student are, as long as they\u2019re righteous goals, be achieved", "i would probably want to teach students that probably just wanted to tell good stories", "i would want to see them make them as well as they could and then have them connect with as many people as they could", "the awards, the money, that\u2019s all silly stuff", "it\u2019s great for everything, but it really has as many issues with it as good things", "it\u2019s just you\u2019d want to find people and i\u2019d want to find students that really just want to tell stories and entertain", "not that they\u2019d want to be a filmmaker because we\u2019re the rock star of the present day or the nba basketball player of the day", "it\u2019s because that\u2019s what they want to do", "when i was a kid, no one knew what spielberg do", "we heard the names lucas and spielberg, but that was it", "but not really", "no one \u2013 how do you become a director", "when i started to do it even in the early \u201890s, it was the early sundance days", "there wasn\u2019t this track record of how to do it", "i wasn\u2019t looking for the reason to be that it could lead to something that was clear", "it was just something that was interesting and fascinating to me", "at this point, when there are all these paths to fame and money and all that", "if you make one film, you can do a marvel movie or something like that, which is happening all the time now", "i think you want to find people that are looking to tell the stories and then help them tell the stories", "the last class i taught at nyu, my best student was a turkish kid who was going back to turkey to tell a small story about an apple tree on the side of mount ararat that starts a village fight", "a tiny story", "it could be huge, who knows", "but he was serious and he just wanted to tell that story", "i gravitated to him and i spent most of my time in the class working with him to help him because he was the guy who was going to go make a movie and was serious and knew what he was doing", "i said let me focus on this kid so the other kids can be inspired by this path", "any top scripts if somebody has never read a screenplay and you\u2019re like, look, just start with a, b, c", "i mean, the guys

lot of great scripts that i\u2019ve read", "charlie kaufman\u2019s scripts are great and fun to read", "that\u2019s enough to start with", "yeah, i think so", "where can people find the film", "where should they learn more about it", "i\u2019ve never had something \u2013 mother!", "yes, exactly", "just for everybody listening, i highly recommend you check it out", "like darren said, know

\u2013 a very unique dreamlike state for about 18 hours afterwards", "that\u2019s amazing", "yeah, it was really profound", "where can people learn more about it", "well, it\u2019s mother", "with a lowercase m and an exclamation point, which causes all different type of difficulties with social media because of the exclamation point", "but by the time this comes out, i hope it\u2019s going to be around", "if not, just google mother", "movie, and you\u2019ll be seeing a bunch about it, i hope", "where can people, if they want to check you out on social media", "both my full name

york", "humans of new york", "but more projections of mother", "very cool", "so people can say hi to you on the interwebs and check it out", "absolutely", "any last asks or recommendations of the people beside seeing the movie", "keep seeing the weird stuff", "go out and support and then spread the word", "i think if you dig the movie, get it out there and get everyone to go see it", "i\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s the type of film that you\u2019ll want to talk to other people about", "well, i can attest certainly with one or two people i saw it with", "we talked about it for hours afterward", "one of the things i really enjoyed is it does not follow the typical template, any typical template that i can see", "it leads to a lot of conversation", "dare to be different", "dare to be different", "yeah", "well, darren, i really appreciate the time", "thank you, tim", "it\u2019s been amazing", "yeah, this has been really fun", "we can keep going, but i want to let you get back to
