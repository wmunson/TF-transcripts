Sanjayan, PhD. Oh, my goodness, are you in for a treat. You\u2019re going to hear about everything from monkeys and birthday cakes to building a personal board of advisors for yourself. I\u2019m not going to give you the bio right this second because you\u2019re going to hear it from a live recording. The live recording was taken at Sixth & I, a very famous historic location in Washington, DC. Sixthandi.org. You can check them out. Where I interviewed to different people in separate sessions. Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL and known for many other things, and then, M Sanjayan who you are going to hear from next. Enjoy. Is everybody loosened up, limbered? Let\u2019s just jump right into it. This is going to be fun. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this, trying to make this happen, hoping to make this happen, and here we are. So, let me just jump right into out. Our next guest is M. Sanjayan, PhD, a global conservation scientist specializing in how nature preserves and enhances human life. He serves as Conservation International\u2019s chief executive officer. We have met before. And we\u2019ll get into that. Sanjayan joined CI in 2014 as executive vice president and senior scientist and has led several key divisions, underscoring that for you guys, including oceans, science, development, branded communications, and strategic priorities. That sounds like a lot. Sanjayan holds a doctorate from the University of California Santa Cruz. And his peer reviewed scientific work has been published in journals, including science, nature, and conservation biology. He is a visiting researcher at UCLA and a distinguished professor of practice at Arizona State University. Raised in Southeast Asia and Africa, Sanjayan\u2019s background and expertise provide a unique lens for hosting and co-hosting a range of documentaries for PBS, BBC, Discovery, and Showtime. Most recently, he hosted the University of California and Vox Media\u2019s Climate Lab series. Sanjayan is a Disney Nature Ambassador, Cato fellow at the Aspen Institute, and a member of the National Geographic Society Explorers\u2019 Council. He posts frequently from his expeditions @msanjayan on Twitter. Please welcome to the stage, M. Sanjayan. M. Sanjayan: Hello. Tim Ferriss: Welcome. All right. So, I want to start with something we were discussing very briefly before we got up here. And I said wait, wait, wait, don\u2019t tell me. I want to hear the story, but let\u2019s save it. What is your full birth name? M. Sanjayan: Okay. Can you guys hear me? Okay. First of all, Tim called me up yesterday, when I was in Botswana getting on a flight 22 hours to get here and said, \u201cHey, are you in DC because I\u2019m going to be there?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not just arriving.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m there for 24 hours, but hey, I\u2019d love to see you. Do you want to come to this thing? Oh, by the way, do you want to be on stage?\u201d And I\u2019m not very good at saying no, which we\u2019ll get to, having listened to his last podcast about saying no to things. But I feel so much better today because I realized it isn\u2019t a last minute invitation because he did the same thing to Steve Case. I\u2019m feeling really good about it. So, I\u2019m a [inaudible]. I\u2019m from Sri Lanka. And some of us are just given one name. So, on my birth certificate, it just says Sanjayan. But my dad\u2019s name, which I use as a last name like from my American passport, is Muttulingam. And I don\u2019t use it much for two reasons. One reason is an obvious one because, if someone said Dr. Muttulingam, it would be my dad who would look, not me. So, I don\u2019t associate it distinctly with myself. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve told everyone. The reason I don\u2019t tend to use it, I\u2019ve never, ever told this to anyone, at least not in a public audience, is that when I came to America, people have this obsession about what your name means. They always ask you like oh, wow, cool name. What does that name mean? I don\u2019t go around going like Michael, what does your name mean? I\u2019m an angel. It doesn\u2019t come up. But they do tend to ask that of foreigners, for some reason. And the problem is this name Muttulingam quite literally means giant pearl penis. And until I was like a junior, I was deeply conscious of that, and I would never say it. And then, one day, in a bar, somehow, it kind of blurted out. And the reaction I got was really? And so then, it became not a problem anymore sort of thing. Tim Ferriss: That sounds like a last name meaning I would shout from the rooftops. M. Sanjayan: So, you know what lingam, is, look it up. That\u2019s like a phallic representation. It\u2019s like penis. It\u2019s the same thing. And muttu means pearl. It\u2019s actually mother of pearl. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like the Hope Diamond of penises. M. Sanjayan: Yeah. I know. It can be \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s the best last name ever or adopted last name. So, I think the most logical segue here is to ask you about bullying during your childhood. We\u2019ve suffered, many of us, through bullying. And I want to talk about a monkey who stole your birthday cake. M. Sanjayan: How do you know that? Tim Ferriss: Can you explain what the hell is going on here? Yeah, could you please explain monkey birthday cake story? M. Sanjayan: Sure. I\u2019ll do that very quickly because it actually comes to one of your questions that you ask people, which is about a strange habit. So, one of my strange habits or unusual habit is that I like to do something new, something I\u2019ve never done before, I like to try it on my birthday. And that\u2019s a tradition. It\u2019s been everything from writing poetry to learning how to snowboard when I was 45 to fly fishing to learning to bake a beef Wellington. So, it could be anything that I\u2019ve never done before. And I instituted this as a practice about 15 years ago because I would always get very depressed on my birthday because what happened on my birthday is that \u2013 this is a long story. I have to do it very short. So, a very quick version is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: No, no. No quick version. It doesn\u2019t have to be short. M. Sanjayan: So, at 5 years old, we just moved from Sri Lanka to Sierra Leone, West Africa. And not just in town. We were like in the bush, in the country like way out there. My mother, amazingly \u2013 in Sri Lanka, I was like a little prince. I had these amazing cakes like a battleship cake, entire zoo cake. It was like that kind of cake. And then, we went to Sierra Leone, and we had to flee Sri Lanka in the middle of the night because of trouble in the country. And my mom actually packed, which is amazing I think back on it, a pound of flour and icing sugar because we came to Sierra Leone on December 4, and my birthday was on December 26. And she knew this. And so, out there, in the middle of the jungle, she baked me a cake. It was a simple, little, round cake with chocolate frosting, which is like the simplest frosting you can get. Basically, you can make it almost anywhere. And I didn\u2019t like it. So, I was crying. I was weeping. I was unhappy about it. My mother eventually got tired. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s it, here\u2019s the cake.\u201d She put it on the table. She goes in to take a bath, and I kind of stop crying, as you do when you\u2019re 5 and no one is watching, and I walk into the living room. And, out of the corner of my eye, I catch a glimpse of something. I turn and look, and there\u2019s a monkey. And the monkey is holding my cake like this. And the monkey looks at me, and I look at the monkey, and we\u2019re both like \u2013 the monkey is like \u2013 and then, it jumps. It jumps on the window sill and it flees, it goes, gone. And I go screaming in, \u201cThe cake, the cake, my cake,\u201d like just that kind of thing. My mom comes out. She\u2019s like worried, petrified. She\u2019d only been in the country for a few days, at that point, like 22 days, shaking me. She\u2019s like are you okay, are you okay. And I\u2019m like the cake, the cake. She goes to the window, no cake there. She goes to the window, and our house is on stilts to avoid flooding in the rain forest. And she looks down, and the cake is down there. And she turns to me, and she says, \u201cYou wicked, wicked child. Your birthday is cancelled forever. We will never do birthday again. Just wait until your father comes home.\u201d And that was it. And now, I\u2019m on the floor because, for a child, injustice is like the worst thing ever. So, since then, birthdays have been really, really difficult for me. It\u2019s also on December 26, which is not great for lots of reasons. And so, it creates this gigantic sense of anxiety. It\u2019s never good enough. It carried right into adulthood. It was very, very destructive to everyone around me. And even today, by the way, when we get together with my family, there is discussion about whether I threw the cake out the window or not. And this has what\u2019s happened to my mind. I start thinking did I really see that monkey, or did I actually throw the cake? I don\u2019t even know, after a while, which is sort of interesting. Anyway, that\u2019s a very long story, but that\u2019s it. Sorry. Tim Ferriss: That is a great story. I want to hear the monkey\u2019s version of that story. At some point, I\u2019ll track that monkey down. That will be a really awkward podcast. How did your parents, or how did your family, end up going to Sierra Leone, of all places? M. Sanjayan: My dad got attacked in the middle of the night. My parents are the mildest, meekest mannered Asians you can possibly meet. My dad is an accountant. And even now, when I travel, in Botswana or Namibia or Indonesia or Colorado, Aspen, the same advice. Don\u2019t talk to strangers. Be careful what you eat. Call. It\u2019s the same kind of meek, careful advice. But they had this one gigantic moment of courage, which I still don\u2019t understand because, even today, it would be a massive deal to do. But these Asians who never have left the country decided to pick up their 5-year-old and 1-year-old and, over a weekend, decide that the country was getting politically really bad. And with two suitcases and only the jewelry my mother had, just left. And the only place my dad had a job offer was in Sierra Leone as an accountant for a forestry company. Later on, his career just took off, and he did great. But it just was this unbelievable thing. And not just Freetown. This is like where Ebola was recently. This is where there was a 30 year civil war in Sierra Leone. We didn\u2019t just go to the capital. We went 200 miles in the interior and lived in like a tree house with, quite literally, monkeys, obviously, around us. And I don\u2019t get that. And I still ask them. And they\u2019re like yeah, you know, we didn\u2019t have a choice. Just like the two lotteries you win. The parents you have, that\u2019s one lottery. You don\u2019t get to pick that. I won that one. And the country of your birth is your second lottery. I sort of snuck into that one. But those are the two things. And Steve is completely right. All of the other things in your life tend not to matter as much as those two lotteries that you get. Tim Ferriss: So, let\u2019s talk about the factors \u2013 or maybe if you could describe for us how you ended up in science and then conservation. M. Sanjayan: Sure. I always loved nature. I loved animals. I think all kids love nature and love things that move. And, as you get older, it kind of gets beaten out of you. You just stop encouraging to do that. But my parents just let me do that because it was the only thing that was sort of around me. And I fooled them for a long time thinking I was sort of in pre-med and kind of went further and further into that realm, until, eventually, very late in my \u2013 I had my master\u2019s and just getting into my PhD, I sort of realized there\u2019s actually a career that was actually open to Asians in thinking about the environment and thinking about conservation and thinking about actually saving the planet. You could actually do that respectably so for most of your life and be okay with it. It took a lot of convincing for that bigger family to get that. Once I got my PhD, I tell a story of it, I went back to Sri Lanka. And my grandmother, I overheard her telling her friend who is like across the wall, kind of leans over, and they have this conversation. My grandson is back. He\u2019s a doctor now, but not the kind that saves people. And she had to add that, right? And I started thinking about it. And I\u2019m like isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re actually trying to do because, ultimately, it\u2019s all connected? People need nature to thrive. And that is one virtuous cycle. But it was a fooling game. And I bet many, many people who follow their \u201cpassion\u201d, sort of try to find their way do a lot of fooling around and fooling of other people, fooling of social circles. I was just lucky, lucky, lucky enough that there was enough there. And I finally realized that I could actually do this. Tim Ferriss: What was the triggering event? You were getting, at the time, your master\u2019s and PhD were in what? M. Sanjayan: So, where were they? Tim Ferriss: The fields, what was the concentration? M. Sanjayan: It was biology for my master\u2019s, and genetics for my PhD. Tim Ferriss: And was there a conversation or a book or something that proved to you that conservation could be a path you could embrace? Or was it \u2013 M. Sanjayan: Honestly, I wish there was something more epic on that. I think there were two moments in my life where I made these big leaps. The first was coming to America, deciding that I wanted to be here for graduate school or for my higher education. And that was because of Bruce Springsteen, kid you not. Kid you not. That\u2019s how we picked colleges back then because I didn\u2019t have the internet. And I definitely didn\u2019t have any way of knowing why America would make sense for me. Very little concept of America. But someone gave me that Nebraska album. And I remember looking at the cover of that album. And something about that cover and something about the songs on that and the last song on that album. And it just made you want to think of sort of endless possibilities and wide open spaces. And it always felt confined in my life, confined by society or by whatever. I was always a stranger in a strange land no matter where we moved because we moved around a lot throughout Africa and sometimes into Asia. And I just felt that was a big leap. Taking the sort of bet to come to America. And then, the second one, I think, had more to do with I had an amazing advisor, a guy named Michael Soul\u00e9 who was the father of conservation biology. He really coined that word, and he put it on the map. And 20 years ago, he was the guy. And I was lucky enough to work with him. I just cold called him and sort of pestered him until he took me on as a student. And I think that made me realize there was a path there. Tim Ferriss: So, you mentioned this professor. Could you remind me of his last name, the pronunciation? M. Sanjayan: Soule, S-O-U-L- E. Tim Ferriss: Now, I\u2019ve read that he told you your job as a graduate student was to train yourself as a critical thinker. I believe, maybe that\u2019s the internet lying to me again, but \u2013 M. Sanjayan: No, so, what was true is I was eager to say things. You thought that\u2019s what you did. I wanted to go save wildlife. And he said, \u201cNo. Right now, your job is to just do a really good piece of science. It\u2019s actually good advice. Do a really hard piece of work so that you\u2019d own it, and you\u2019d know that, once in your life, you could do that. And there\u2019s time enough later to say things. He tells me now that he might not have said that advice today. But, at that time, it made an impression on me, and that\u2019s sort of what I did. Tim Ferriss: Why wouldn\u2019t he give that advice today? Did he explain it? M. Sanjayan: I think he is so distraught about what has happened in the last 20 or 30 years to our planet. And so, am I. And I think we all are really impatient. And I keep waiting for other people to see something that I have seen. And very, very few people around me, somehow, seem to have that gene turned on. And I think that impatience is what sort of makes us sometimes be irrational, but other times just feel desperate. Tim Ferriss: So, the intention, just to take a step back so you guys have a meta context here \u2013 what are we doing? That\u2019s the question of the evening. So, initially, I was like you know what would be really fun? Is to have Steve Case come up, who is in the book, and ask him questions that aren\u2019t in the book. And then, to have someone, you, come up and ask the questions that are in the book. But then, of course, we got the birthday cake and the monkey, and we\u2019re off on a completely different landscape. So, I\u2019m going to bounce around between questions that I\u2019m dying to ask but then the questions that I feel like would be fun to sprinkle throughout. So, there\u2019s going to be very little connective tissue. It\u2019s going to be like the worst edited movie you\u2019ve ever seen. What purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in recent memory? M. Sanjayan: That\u2019s a really hard question for me because I don\u2019t buy a lot of stuff. I\u2019m a total snob when it comes to the stuff I own. And the reason for that is because I travel incessantly. And when I travel, I just have one bag, and I have to take it. So, everything I own has to do like double duty. And so, I\u2019m very, very, very picky about either simplifying or just taking exactly what I like. So, I can\u2019t think of something really easy that comes to mind under $100.00 that I could just name. Ice Breaker Underwear. Ice Breaker is a great company. They produce amazing stuff all out of marina wool, a New Zealand based company. I think you and I both know the founder, Jeremy Moon. And I like his person ethos, and his stuff works. I don\u2019t get paid by his company or anything like that. But that\u2019s probably the last under $100.00 purchase I made that I love. Tim Ferriss: Do you have a go to bag? You mentioned you have one bag. Have you vetted a lot of bags? M. Sanjayan: Yeah. So, I used to love this Victoria Knox bag. They don\u2019t make it anymore. It just kills you, right? It really kills you. You just figure out that there\u2019s something that works really well, and then, they go and change it. It\u2019s like shoes, athletic shoes. Oh, my God, did they change it. And there\u2019s a whole race to change it fast. So, this is really a hard question because I now use a Tumi bag, and I like it because I like the four wheels. I also like the sturdiness of that bag. It\u2019s heavy. That\u2019s the downside on it. But I\u2019m getting older, so, I can\u2019t really carry things on my back anymore, so, I need the four wheeled, Tumi bag. Tim Ferriss: Do you have a protocol for surviving or maintaining your sanity and health for really long flights? Like that flight from Botswana where I ambushed you with this invitation? Is there anything special you do? And I know friends who carry saline misters for their noses or wrap their heads in all sorts of weird contraptions to block out sound and light. Or do you just go out, and you\u2019re done? M. Sanjayan: No, I try to be as comfortable as I possibly can during the flight. It\u2019s just the usual stuff. I try to get myself on the new time zone fast. I\u2019m very strategic about when I drink coffee or anything like coffee or tea, very strategic about the timing on that. I tend to fast a little bit on flights. I don\u2019t eat a lot just because I can catch up later. And it always makes me feel a little better. I guess that\u2019s sort of it. Sometimes, you get \u2013 it depends. I did this flight, and I\u2019ll be absolutely honest with you, I fly so much that, sometimes, I\u2019m flying in business class, especially for very, very long flights when I have to land there and get into meetings. Sometimes, I fly in economy. I did this very long flight from Sydney to Johannesburg, and I\u2019m in the back of an old 747, middle seat with these two very nice but large Samoan gentlemen. And I decided \u2013 the plane hadn\u2019t even really taken off. They both fell asleep. And their hands kept falling into my lap, boom, like this. And I had to lift and put it. That kind of flight, you just have to completely do this mind shift. So, I stripped all of my stuff off, got into my jeans and a t-shirt, curled up, made my little space, and then, I started playing this game. So, all you have to do is think about what worst form of transportation you could be stuck in in that moment. So, you just have to think this could be Mombasa to Kampala truck ride right now in the back of a local bus. And you\u2019re like oh, my God, this would be so much better than that. I can order food. I can get drinks. Just infinitely better, infinitely better. So, that\u2019s the trick. I once had to spend an entire month in a very small cabin on a boat, no windows. It\u2019s a research vessel. I\u2019m stuck in there with another roommate, tiny, for a month. And we had food, literally, cans of food under our bed. That\u2019s how small the whole \u2013 but I kept thinking this is like a sleeper suite on Singapore Airlines like a $20,000.00 ticket right now because I can sleep. There\u2019s a shower. I can walk around. And it just makes you feel so much better. So, that\u2019s the trick with distance. Any time there\u2019s space constraint, just think of what\u2019s worse and then just mind shift. It works. Tim Ferriss: No, it sounds like a fantastic trick. I\u2019m still thinking about the thick Samoan hands landing in your lap. If you were to \u2013 we were talking about one of your mentors and the advice he gave you. If you were to have the opportunity to teach say, I\u2019ll give you three options, a ninth grade class, college freshmen class, or college senior class, you choose one of those three and to teach a seminar or class of your choosing, what age would you choose, and what would you teach for a semester? M. Sanjayan: So, tell me again how old people are at ninth grade because I didn\u2019t go to school here. Tim Ferriss: Ninth grade is 14 or 15, I would say. Fourteen probably. M. Sanjayan: I\u2019d probably teach that freshmen seminar class. Tim Ferriss: Freshmen College. M. Sanjayan: Freshmen College. Because I think I have relatable experiences that I can translate to that group, and it\u2019s still early enough for their trajectory to make a big difference. So, that\u2019s probably why I\u2019d pick that group. And what would I teach? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. What would the class be? And it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 there\u2019s no pre-req. There\u2019s no \u2013 M. Sanjayan: It would be like how to get shit done. Tim Ferriss: This is a good subject. M. Sanjayan: It\u2019s like so much stuff that we learned in college is wasted. You just think about the vast amount of stuff that they taught us that we never, ever actually use. So, I would probably teach a class, being really honest because I do teach at universities. So, it would probably be something about biology and something about the environment. So, chances are it will be in that vein. It might be a class in communication because I\u2019ve done enough television work and stuff like that to be able to do that legitimately so or storytelling. But I would probably teach a class in biology. But if I really could get away with it, I would do something like all of the things you wish you\u2019d known getting into this, or how to organize your life to get stuff done. And it would be kind of in that vain. I\u2019d actually just, basically, take some of your books, crib it, regurgitate it. Tim Ferriss: So, I want to ask both about the getting shit done freshmen seminar, but let\u2019s just, as a thought exercise, if it were, instead, so, you don\u2019t have to think about the entire semester, if it were just a three to four hour seminar, what would be some of the key principles or strategies or anything that you would want to hammer home? M. Sanjayan: You\u2019re getting me after a really long flight, so, my brain is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: And we could also buy some time by asking you what you would teach in a storytelling class. M. Sanjayan: So, stay with the first one. Tim Ferriss: Or \u2013 no, I\u2019m kidding. M. Sanjayan: So, what was the question, again, sorry? Tim Ferriss: The question was, if you have a three to four hour seminar on getting shit done, what are some of the \u2013 any of the key messages or strategies of anything that you would emphasize? Because you get a lot done. I\u2019ve observed how much you do, and it boggles my mind. I don\u2019t know how you stand in one piece. M. Sanjayan: Yeah. So, there\u2019s some of the principles that you\u2019d probably want to get into are dealing with focus. So, this is a major challenge, especially for younger people. And it\u2019s not getting any better. And I have the ability, and it\u2019s not because I have some magical ability, it\u2019s just because I practice it, of intensely focusing on one thing for a few seconds or for a few minutes. And I think that ability to intensely focus on something and not be distracted from anything else is a very useful habit to have. And so, I\u2019m very good at \u2013 when you\u2019re one on one, you can be one on one, and you can be very focused. And I think that\u2019s true for storytelling. I think that\u2019s true for really getting information out of people. And I think helping people focusing on one thing and then, switching to another, so a serial focus, is a very, very useful practice. I think that we waste enormous amounts of time pretending to work. And we can just sort of get rid of that whole thing. I think we\u2019re not honest with ourselves about what we\u2019re really good at and what we\u2019re not good at. And very early, success to light is being absolutely, brutally honest about what you\u2019re not good at. And you can compensate for it, in some ways. But just don\u2019t \u2013 ask people what do you think you\u2019re good at. And they\u2019ll sort of tell you their resume, or they\u2019ll recite you that \u2013 and that\u2019s not particularly useful. I\u2019ll tell them about the things that I wish I had \u2013 I think every student going through should take a class in ethics. I think every student going through should take a class on communications and storytelling. I think every student who goes through should think about how, during their four year or whatever their college term is, spending a little time working on something that is completely unrelated to their primary area of interest. That was probably the best thing I ever did when I was going through the American education system is that, during the summers, I was restricted on what jobs I could do because I was a foreign student. I would go and work at the World Bank. And for a biologist to be walking around at the World Bank was a very strange thing, at the time. And it was unbelievably useful to me. It was like the most useful thing I did, really. Tim Ferriss: Why was it useful? M. Sanjayan: Because it put me in touch with a whole bunch of people who were completely unlike me and would think about the world in completely different terms. I\u2019d go in there, and they\u2019d be like you must be an economist. And I\u2019d be like no, I\u2019m a wildlife biologist. And they\u2019d be like wow, that\u2019s crazy. What are you doing here? But I just started realizing how they worked and how a whole different set of rules applied and how a whole other institution was working on problems. And it just opened my eyes. The easiest thing would have been for me to go work for a nonprofit like the one I work for now, a conservation [inaudible]. I didn\u2019t do that. I really, particularly, went and got jobs in areas that had nothing, nothing to do with my primary area of interest just to see what it looked like. And the best \u2013 the funnest things in the world are all on those angles when you can bring two different fields together. There\u2019s so much gold in those angles. You do that all of the time, actually. And I\u2019ve really \u2013 learning how to exploit that is often your little trick to getting a head start. Tim Ferriss: It makes me think, also, of career advice that I\u2019ve heard from both Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, and also Mark Andreessen in different senses. But they\u2019ve said, this is more Scott Adams and his writing, that there are different ways to \u201csucceed\u201d. One is you can try to be say top 1 percent of 1 percent like a Michael Jordan in one skill. That\u2019s really, really, really difficult. The other approach is that you can be say in the top 10 percent in 2 typically uncombined areas. So, you have Scott Adams who would say himself, he\u2019s not the best artist. He\u2019s not the best comedian. But he\u2019s unusually good at combining both of those things. And, in the world of business, it could be a JD plus computer science, or softer skills. And I\u2019ve heard Warren Buffet talk about his best ever investment being I believe it was Toast Masters or some equivalent public speaking course because you layer that on top of almost anything, and it automatically puts you in a position to have a really unfair advantage. So, storytelling, you were kind enough, we were trading before this, and you mentioned storytelling So, this is one thing I highlighted of notes that you sent to me, which was storytelling was one way to rule the world. And another friend of mine who has been on the podcast, Chris Sacca who is just an incredible investor, hilarious guy, but he originally trained to be a lawyer. And he was beaten soundly, at one point, by this guy who got \u2013 after Chris had presented all of his spreadsheets and all of the data, and some guy got up, I think it was in Arkansas or Texas or somewhere, and he was like you can\u2019t lead a horse to water or something. He just started speaking in five or six different parables and completely kicked Chris\u2019s ass. And so, Chris concluded that stories beat spreadsheets. How have you developed your ability to tell stories? Or how would you recommend people develop, perhaps, books, tools, practices, the ability to tell better stories because I think it\u2019s, as you\u2019ve said, so, so, so powerful. M. Sanjayan: Right. So, I really agree with what you just said. And I think storytelling is one really powerful way to kind of rule the world. And a lot of people that we kind of look up to and think about like from Einstein to Elon Musk to Steve Jobs, they were really powerful storytellers, in their own way. So, they had this ability through words or through images to really convince you that you could do something that no one else could think about. And just that mind shift that they created propelled you along with their vision. And, all of a sudden, you were doing it. So, and you absolutely learn those skills. You can actually get better at it. When I was in high school, I was painfully shy. Like painfully shy. I wore very thick glasses. I had long hair. I did get beaten up all of the time. I went to school, for my high school, I went to school, it was like Hogwarts\u2019s without any of the magic. So, it was tough. But I had a break. And the break was, this is such a funny break, so, I was sent to boarding school in England for a year. And the break was that we had a debate team, which was quite good. And it would go up against like Eaton and all of the other schools like that. And the kid who was supposed to be the main kid for this debate team got ill. And they suggested that I fill that role, and I did. And I really had to \u2013 the first time I did this, they make fun of my accent because I had a bit of an accent. I didn\u2019t actually have much of an accent, but in their minds, I had a very strong Asian accent. And what I did was I started the debate with that very, very strong \u2013 I over emphasized. Everyone laughed at me. I laughed at myself. I got over it. And I moved on. That\u2019s not a big deal to do today. But when you\u2019re 14 or 15, it feels big and scary and really hard to do. And I realized there was power in that. By the way, we went all the way to the finals, and this kid then got well. And then, they kicked me off the team. And then, this kid actually lost. I\u2019m not saying anything here, but this is exactly what happens in my life. Literally, three debates, three rounds we were doing fine. The team was doing great. Okay. He had chicken pox. And then, he was out of quarantine, so, he could come back on the team. And then, I was off. So, you can practice, and you can get better. So, I practiced. And I think about it, and I think about how people tell stories. Look at Tim\u2019s \u2013 you open those first couple of pages, and he talks that little story that he puts in there about what he was grappling with in his college days. It immediately captivates you. You just immediately want to know more and read more. So, there\u2019s real power there. And you can develop and get better at it. So, what are some of the ways in which you can do this? So, you have to be genuinely interested in the stories you\u2019re telling. You can\u2019t fake that. If you\u2019re interviewing someone, you\u2019ve got to be actually a fan of that person. If you\u2019re not a fan of that topic or that person or not genuinely interested, it\u2019s just not going to work. You\u2019ve got to own that story. It\u2019s got to be all you. You can\u2019t bluff the story. You can\u2019t lie about it. You can learn a story and repeat someone else\u2019s story. But you really have to own it in like a deep, deep sense of it. You have to know when to stop. You have to know when to \u2013 the message is also important. That\u2019s something I often say. It\u2019s not just the story, but it\u2019s also the kind of stories you tell, and they have to be true to who you are as a storyteller. So, I\u2019m not a professional at like teaching people how to tell stories. I can\u2019t do that professionally. I know I do it. I know I practice it. I got it from my parents. I think it\u2019s a wonderful craft to think about. Read books and figure out what piece of that is really catching your heart. It always starts with the heart. It always comes from a place of commonality and laughter and love or pain or something from the heart before you can engage the mind. And those sorts of stories always tend to win. Tim Ferriss: So, I want to underscore something you said. And then, I want to ask about this very, very clear smirk that came on your face when you just said something a second ago. But I think the going for the heart or noticing what captures the heart applies to questions, too.\u00a0 For instance. Cal Fussman who was one of the main writers of the What I Learned column in Esquire for a long, long, long time, I want to say 10 plus interviews, interviewed Gorbachev and all of these people routinely would get told, right before an interview, yeah, this hour long interview, you now have five minutes. And so, he would have to hook someone like Gorbie into continuing to talk. And he\u2019d think about his questions. And then, he\u2019d say tell me about when your father left for war. Was there any particular lesson he taught you? And he would go for the emotion first. And that would then allow him to get to the headier questions later. So, I think that it applies to not only the telling of stories, but the asking, the eliciting of stories. M. Sanjayan: And good storytelling is that, right. So, in a good story, a really phenomenal story is one way you actually are having this relationship with the audience. And it\u2019s a two-way story. And when people do that magically, you\u2019re a whole other kind of level of it. And when you talk about how you organize your questions, it sounds so simple. Like okay, he\u2019s got a bunch of questions. But there\u2019s so much thought going into it because you\u2019re actually engaging a story. And you\u2019re doing it in that way so that you can get the whole thing kind of coming out, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Absolutely. And the piece that I wanted to ask about, and maybe it was just because you enjoy smiling and do it so well, but you said you have to know when to stop. And then, I think you had this big grin on your face. Maybe that was me noticing something that wasn\u2019t there. But what\u2019s behind knowing when to stop? What\u2019s the opposite? What does that look like? Just telling a long story that goes on too long? M. Sanjayan: So, the best storytellers leave you wanting to hear more. The best comedians just absolutely will leave you wanting to hear more. There\u2019s a real art to that. You can\u2019t give it all away. You have to leave the audience saying I wanted to hear \u2013 tell me more. And that\u2019s really important about knowing when to be able to stop. And you can over explain things many, many ways. And I\u2019m really not articulate today, by the way. I\u2019m apologizing a little bit for that. But that\u2019s a really important skill to know like when does that story end. Don\u2019t bury the punchline. So many times, it\u2019s like there\u2019s a whole wind up where I\u2019m going to tell you a story about a monkey that stole my \u2013 don\u2019t do that. Just go right into it because you have them at the first minute. And then, every minute after that, you\u2019re going to start losing audience share, so, you want to get it fast and get right into it as fast as you can. Tim Ferriss: So, I want to talk about \u2013 M. Sanjayan: By the way, can I tell you one thing about that? Tim Ferriss: Yes, of course. M. Sanjayan: So, when I was talking about the message about owning a story, go do this when you get a chance, when you get home. You know that song Respect, R-E-S-P-E-C-T? You know that song, right? So, who sang that? Aretha Franklin. Everyone knows Aretha Franklin. Everyone can hum it right now. If I played it to you, you\u2019d know it in a heartbeat. She\u2019s not the one who actually first sang it. It was actually done by Otis Redding. Same words, same song, very different meaning. The song is really exact opposite of what Aretha makes that song to be. Otis Redding\u2019s song is like I\u2019m working all day, woman, and I\u2019m putting food on the table for you. And when I fucking come home \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry I said that. Tim Ferriss: No, no, no. Curse away. M. Sanjayan: I think it\u2019s in this song, when I come home, all I want is just some god damn respect. That\u2019s his song. Never made it big, but Otis Redding was a big singer by then. A decent blues song. She owned it. She completely \u2013 same words, but just the way she put that story together, her complete ownership of it. And who will forget her spelling of that just makes her the one who remembers it. And later on in life, Otis actually kind of complained slightly about her taking the song and making it so huge and no one remembers that he\u2019s the one who recorded and sang it and performed it for at least two years before she came along. So, you want to see two stories, same story, told in different ways, listen to those two songs. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s amazing. I had no idea. I want to talk about some of the stories, and the stories may not be the right word, but narratives that have stuck with you. And I\u2019m going to prompt it with a question. And I can certainly cheat a little bit and prompt. But what is the book or books you\u2019ve given the most as a gift and why? Or books that have influenced you? M. Sanjayan: Yeah. Tim and I have talked about this a little bit. So, for me, books are all about the moment and the emotion that I\u2019m in and the person I\u2019m giving it to is in. and so, I can\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s one book that has predominated how I give because I love books, and I love to give books. And I carry books around. Even today, I brought two books for you to autograph that I\u2019m giving away. So, there\u2019s an act of giving. And a book is a wonderful way to convey something to another person. Books that I\u2019ve loved giving away, Norman McClain\u2019s A River Runs Through It. I read that book in so many different ways, in so many pieces. It totally influenced my life in terms of fly fishing and finding magic in words and that quiet space. He also wrote that book when he was 71 years old. Kind of only the really big book he wrote. It was at 71. And you think about all of this sort of bullshit about creative genius being in the young and all of that. As you get older, you start appreciating it. If Norman could do it at 71, maybe I could do it not quite at 71 yet. Another book I really liked, a more recent book, is Stanley McChrystal\u2019s Team of Teams. Completely different reason. Just a really clever, smart book about how to organize businesses and enterprises for today\u2019s world. And he takes this experiential army in Afghanistan and brings it over to sort of your life or my life and makes it kind of relevant and meaningful. I found it very influential. I\u2019ve given away quite a few copies of James Nester\u2019s book, The Deep, which you might have read, right. You\u2019ve read his book. Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t read The Deep. M. Sanjayan: That book is pretty damn good. It\u2019s about free diving, which I knew nothing about. That was one of my birthday things. That was like two years ago. So, I thought I\u2019ll try this free diving thing because I read Nester\u2019s book. And it\u2019s amazing, the physiology of the human body and what it can do is amazing. So, I read this book. It\u2019s about free diving, a very scary, it can be a very dangerous sport, but also an amazing sport because it completely changes the way you think about your body and what you\u2019re capable of. And I thought this book inspired me. I\u2019m going to go try and take a lesson in free diving. So, I went to Hawaii around my birthday, and I took a lesson from a very, very good \u2013 you want to do this with someone very, very good, and I did. And this woman, Shelly Eisenberg, who was my teacher for the day, basically, this is what she did. Within three hours, I could hold my breath for maybe 45 seconds, maybe a minute if I tried. Within three hours, three hours, just by doing exercises with me, she had me at two minutes, ten seconds. That floored me. It would be like saying how fast can you run around, I\u2019d be like I can do a nine minute mile. And you say give me three hours, and I\u2019ll get you down to a six minute. You just couldn\u2019t do that. And that floored me. And she\u2019s like yeah, let\u2019s keep going. And sure enough, you\u2019re doing three minutes. You\u2019re doing three minutes within twenty-four hours. Unbelievable. True story, you can do it. Everyone in here can do that, too. That\u2019s why that book was so kind of mentally transformative. Tim Ferriss: I feel obligated as the person who is certainly not a doctor, and you\u2019ve heard this before, I don\u2019t play one on the internet. But you have to be very, very careful with this type of training. So, do not take the DIY approach. I know people who have died. And I know people who have come very close to dying from shadow water black outs. And when you, depending on the technique, if you blow off a lot of CO2, you won\u2019t sense that you\u2019re going to black out before you black out. You\u2019re fine, and then, you\u2019re blacked out, which you don\u2019t really want to have happen in any amount of water. You could Jimi Hendrix yourself, or it could be in 1,000 feet of water, same outcome. So, be very, very careful only with supervision, but it is fascinating. M. Sanjayan: I mean, two Navy seals drowned in a training exercise in San Diego like two years ago, just the two of them trying this out and breaking the rules. The No. 1 with this is you\u2019re doing it with a buddy who can do this better than you can. And you definitely want to do this, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t just try this. I read this book. Then, I went and got one of the best teachers, and I spent time with her. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Billboards, let\u2019s talk about them. If you could have a giant billboard anywhere with anything on it \u2013 M. Sanjayan: A giant what? Tim Ferriss: Billboard, with a message that you would get out to millions and billions of people, what would it say, and why? M. Sanjayan: I\u2019m going to take an easy one. I\u2019m going to use one of the slogans that we at Conservation International use, in some ways, which I would probably say something like either people need nature. That\u2019s not obvious enough. I\u2019d say nature is speaking. Or I might say nature is screaming. And I\u2019d like to put those outside of every place where there\u2019s this \u201cnatural disaster\u201d, which is usually human disaster that was exacerbated by just not listening to nature. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do. And I was always influenced by you drive across this country; you see these signs for religious purposes. So and so deity will do this to you or not do this to you if only you believe. And I always thought why don\u2019t we put that same kind of effort into putting billboards up that says nature is screaming or nature is speaking. When are we going to listen? Something like that. So, that\u2019s probably what I\u2019d put on it. Tim Ferriss: So, I really want to, and this isn\u2019t just professional courtesy, so we can talk about the work you\u2019re doing. Conservation and the state of progressive destruction of our natural habitats and surroundings causes me a lot of anxiety personally. In part because I feel like, for instance, if a study comes out on metabolism, and there are a bunch of conflicting headlines, and things are poorly interpreted by certain media, I can parse it. I can go to [inaudible]. I can figure out what\u2019s what. But, in the world of conservation or trying to do the right thing, I sometimes feel lost, in the sense that I attempt to do the right thing, what I perceive to be the right thing, and then, I find out, oh, shit, that type of wild caught fish or farmed fish is exactly the opposite of what I should be doing or whatever it might be. You\u2019re going to have a lot of people listening to this, people in this room, and then, people on the podcast. If people want to think more precisely about this and feel like they can take proactive steps, what are some of the most common misconceptions about conservation? Or what\u2019s a smart way to just approach thinking about it? M. Sanjayan: Right. So, the first thing I would say is, don\u2019t let perfection and trying to find the silver bullet keep you out of the game. So, we were both, recently, at summit in Los Angeles. And I heard people talk about philanthropy and giving and wanting to find the most perfect way to give. And I was sort of struck by how many people around me were all nodding. And I was just thinking to myself really? Yeah, okay, I want to make sure my dollar goes the furthest as well. But there are so many other things in life, which we waste all of the time, and why this one we want perfection? So, when someone says to me tell me the one thing I can do to change the planet, guess what, there isn\u2019t. There are lots of things. And it\u2019s messy. And you\u2019re not always going to get it right. And is it better to drink out of ceramic cup that you have to wash in hot water or a Styrofoam cup? Those are important questions for you to think about. But, ultimately, they shouldn\u2019t stop you from getting engaged. So, the truth of the matter is very, very, very few people are actually engaged in trying to care about the fate of our planet, the fate of where we live and our kids\u2019 lives. And I just want to get more people in it. And I think if more are in it, then, absolutely, we\u2019ll come up with more honed solutions. But it shouldn\u2019t stop you from getting in it. So, that\u2019s my first thing I would say. If you want to make some small changes in your life, what you eat and how you cook it makes a huge difference. It\u2019s probably the one thing that you could do. So, being thoughtful whether it\u2019s farm caught or wild. That\u2019s a useful question to think about and try to get the best half way there. And I can answer that for you. Like Seafood Watch that the Monterey Bay Aquarium puts out gives you a reasonable pathway. But how you cook and how you waste food, like wasting food, is a big, big deal. Your energy output on those completely outweighs what car you drive or anything like that. So, that\u2019s just something simple you can do. Getting engaged in the political system, I think it really does matter. It really does matter. So, there was this kind of crazy decision very recently on wanting to, at this moment in time, when all of these crises are going on on the planet, on overturning the ban on importing elephant heads from trophy hunting from Zimbabwe and Zambia. That actually somehow became a priority for the administration all of a sudden. We\u2019re going to overturn the ban so that any hunter who goes to Zimbabwe or Zambia and shoots an elephant can bring the ivory and the head into the country. Why is that all of a sudden, the thing to do? And people really got upset about it. And, believe it or not, it kind of did change something, at least for now. There\u2019s been a reversal of that decision. So, the administration has decided to wait on that for a while. So, make your voices heard. It\u2019s important that you make your voices heard. And don\u2019t sit this out. Tim Ferriss: Are there any other resources that you would suggest people look to, like Seafood Watch, or any other websites where people could find simple things they might not think of like the slower shipping to make an impact? Just assuming these people are busy professionals with high demands on their time, where do you suggest they look? M. Sanjayan: Okay. And without being totally self serving. So, I will say my own organization, conservation.org, decent website. You\u2019ll find lots of ways in which you can be engaged. The Nature Conservancy, nature.org, decent website. Lots of ways you can get engaged. Environmental Defense Fund, they do a lot of great work, particularly in the United States around climate. World Resource Institute gives you the macro picture. They have great graphics, great infographics. It gives you sort of the macro picture. I did a series, recently, on Vox with the University of California called Climate Labs, which are just these eight minute, very short, digestible, little videos on something like food waste. Slightly irreverent, slightly counterintuitive, simple ways in which you can either get engaged or make a change in your life. You can have an impact. And so, we took a bunch of different topics like shipping and did the short videos on it. It\u2019s called Climate Labs on Vox. So, those are things that come quickly to mind. But here\u2019s the most important thing, seriously. I really mean this we really are on a race to save the planet. I really, really believe this. Here\u2019s the thing. We\u2019re the only generation who actually has some foresight. Think about this. In the entire history of humanity, we had to rely on crystal balls and a burning bush sitting where we are to give us a glimpse of where we\u2019re heading. And now, we actually have some data. We\u2019re the first generation in human history to see the \u2013 I met John Glen before he passed away. Amazing guy. Amazing American. First American to go around the planet, see the whole thing. I asked him, and he said, \u201cYeah, it blew me away. I never thought we could see the whole planet all at once.\u201d If you were standing on a flat earth, if you\u2019re standing on the sea shore, you see about seven miles. After that, the horizon dips away. And as long as humans have been around, we\u2019ve been climbing taller and taller mountains, towers, trees to be able to see what\u2019s over the horizon. What are we looking for? We\u2019re thinking about a lion that\u2019s over the horizon that might bite us, or looking for opportunity. Now, in our generation, we can see the whole thing. And not only that, we\u2019re also mostly all connected. There is no reason for us not to act right now. And believe me, that window is small. And if we don\u2019t do it, I swear, future generations will look back and say what a waste. You had that opportunity when the opportunity cost was actually relatively cheap. The price of conservation will never get cheaper in the future. It\u2019s as cheap as it\u2019s going to get now, and it will only get more expensive. So, not acting now is crazy. And that\u2019s why people who have done the giving pledge like Steve Case and others, I so applaud that because they\u2019re not just saying we\u2019re going to leave this for future generations to deal with. They\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to deal with it now because, right now, is probably the cheapest to be able to deal with it. Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019ll ask just a few more questions, and then, we\u2019ll do some audience. And then, we\u2019ll head off to tequila shots or whatever comes next. But I really want to ask you what you found helpful for training humans to think more long term because it strikes me that, if you look at history, and you don\u2019t have to go very far back, but you certainly could, we\u2019ve evolved from millions of years, effectively, to survive until puberty, have sex, and procreate. That\u2019s basically it. That\u2019s Darwinism at work. And people act in their intensely worst of interests long term for short term gain. How do you train people to think more in longer term time horizons and in ways that are more communal and not individual? It seems like a very tough task but a very, very, very important one. What are some of the most effective learnings or lessons that you\u2019ve had with that? M. Sanjayan: So, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the truth of the answer. I don\u2019t know how to fundamentally beat evolutionary biology. It is so hard wired into us. The people who do and do it rationally, so, you look at what Charlie Munger says. He says, basically, our investment technique that he and Buffet used is just don\u2019t do anything stupid over the long run. Pretty much he basically says that, right? It\u2019s surprisingly simple but incredibly hard to follow, incredibly hard to follow. And the people who do it tend to be sort of investors and others who sort of faithfully follow a system. But even they get spooked, as we\u2019ve seen many, many times over. So, it\u2019s very difficult to beat it. So, I\u2019m not trying to do that. I\u2019m just trying to figure out how I can make you change your life for the betterment of the planet in your own enlightened self interest. And the better I can do that and tell you that it\u2019s actually going to make your life better now, now, now, now, not even your kids, but your life, the better chance I have of promoting change. The interesting thing is it doesn\u2019t have to be rational because we do so many things that are completely irrational. And so, it doesn\u2019t have to be rational. It can be very emotional. And it has to be about your own enlightened self interest. It can\u2019t be about the future. Tim Ferriss: So, I think, at some point, we\u2019ll have to do a Round 2. M. Sanjayan: And I\u2019m stuck. And any help you have and want to throw it my way, our way, we\u2019ll take it. But I\u2019m actually stuck because I know much better communiques than I am and far smarter people than I am in my field who are, basically, stuck as well. Tim Ferriss: To that point, my next question is going to be what ask would you have of people listening? Is there anything that you\u2019re looking for, any particular type of help, or just next steps that people \u2013 you would like to see people take because you\u2019re going to have a lot of people listening, people in all different walks of life, different sectors, every possible place imaginable. What would you like them to do or consider? M. Sanjayan: So, the most important thing you could do for me or for us or for this cause is to be a messenger. It really is, quite simply, that because the people who are more likely to listen are people like yourselves. They\u2019re more likely to listen to the message coming from you than if it came from me. And that\u2019s really \u2013 so, I strongly believe in that. So, the messenger matters as much as the message. You can reach audiences that I could never reach. So, being that messenger, to carry that message into your community, into your church or synagogue, your place of worship, your school, your community, your family is far, far more useful than me trying to just get my voice to be bigger and bigger and bigger. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. And where can people say hello to you on social or learn more about what you\u2019re up to? Is Twitter the best place? M. Sanjayan: Twitter is a good place. Facebook is also really good because it allows a longer conversation to occur. I can easily be found as M Sanjayan on Facebook. And that\u2019s a good place to also engage. Twitter is fine, too. Tim Ferriss: And then, conservation.org. M. Sanjayan: Yeah. And conservation.org. I think our website and our social media platform is a great place to engage. Tim Ferriss: Perfect. M. Sanjayan: Particularly for a DC audience, but I think also for a global audience. Tim Ferriss: So, this is, I think, a great place to grab just a few questions. And then, we can close up and have some tequila, give George Clooney a few hundred million more dollars, if anybody knows the [inaudible], what a story. M. Sanjayan: By the way, while he\u2019s thinking about that, one other book I wanted to mention to you guys, especially for this town, is a book called Destiny of the Republic by Candace Millard. It\u2019s a fantastic book. She\u2019s a great author, and she talks about President Garfield and being shot and how his life could have been saved, if they had only listened to the surgeon who gave them advice, but he was sort of ignored because he was this black surgeon in the Union Army. And, instead, they took another route, and it\u2019s just a fascinating story about race and technology at the cusp of a really important moment in our nation. About a president that very few people had heard about but who, if he had survived, would have completely changed the course of our country probably for the better. Tim Ferriss: So, this is a question from Bill from Long Island. It\u2019s addressed to me, but I\u2019m going to ask you, since I\u2019ve talked ad nauseum about my mornings. What does the first 60 to 90 seconds of your day look like? I\u2019m going to modify this. But he\u2019s asking what do you do to jump start the first waking moments? Do you have any morning rituals or routines that are consistent for you? M. Sanjayan: Coffee. Yeah. To jump start my day? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Or just anything that you do as part of your routine in the mornings? M. Sanjayan: Yeah. So, I often put the toughest things I need to deal with and the most creative things early in the morning. It\u2019s just as simple as that. I tend not to check my email until I\u2019m actually starting work. That\u2019s just something I \u2013 my work email, until I\u2019m actually starting work because it just really clutters the mind. So, what happens with email, especially for my company because it\u2019s a global organization, so, I get emails in the middle of the night. And so, they pile up. And so, if I find out that if I open my day by checking email, I get diverted into all of these other small things that I am very bad at saying no to. So, I kind of ruin the rest of that day. And rather, I want to sort of set my agenda, then, look at it, and deal with the ones I can deal with and ignore the others. Tim Ferriss: This is a question from it\u2019s either Eric or Erin, I\u2019m not quite sure. Who is your most recent mentor, and what has that person taught you? And if you have an answer for that, great. Otherwise, we could modify it to just be what is a recent lesson that you\u2019ve learned or insight? M. Sanjayan: That\u2019s a good one because it kind of harkens back to Tribe of Mentors. So, one of the things that I did that I found very, very useful in my life, and I think, for many of you, you could apply it, too, is that, some years ago, I created a personal board. So, a group of individuals who would personally spend a little bit of time vesting in my and my success. And I didn\u2019t do this because of some grandiose notion of who I was. But it struck me that, whenever you wanted letters of reference when you go for a job, you always have to sort of scramble around and try to catch up to people who you haven\u2019t spoken to for a long time and hope they give you this letter. And they really don\u2019t know you, by that point, and life has sort of gone by. And I thought what happens if I had a group of five individuals that I would pick, and I would make a promise that I would never solicit them for money, which I have kept up, even though some now do give to CI, but that\u2019s not the purpose. They don\u2019t belong to my organization. They\u2019re not my board for my organization. They\u2019re my personal board. And they\u2019re great people. And I would just say to them, listen, can you do this for me? I\u2019ll meet with you two, maybe three times a week. We\u2019ll have coffee or lunch. Tim Ferriss: Two or three times a week? M. Sanjayan: I\u2019m sorry, two or three times a year. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like man, this is a really generous board. M. Sanjayan: Sorry. And we\u2019ll just have a little conversation and a catch up. And I can just occasionally ping you for guidance. That has been incredibly, incredibly useful. I picked some great people. You might know some of them. But it\u2019s been very, very helpful. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, I want to dig into this because this is really interesting. So, your personal board. M. Sanjayan: By the way, they all said yes. Not one person turned me down. Tim Ferriss: How could we not get into this? Now, I want to mention, just as a side note because people might find this helpful, something that I found very helpful from Chris Fussell who co-authored Team of Teams with Stan McChrystal. And he was Stan\u2019s aide-de-camp for quite a long time in JSOC. And advice he was given was, at all times, you want to surround yourself with at least three people. Someone who is doing an excellent job of what you hope to be doing say a few years from now, someone who is doing a better job than you are, in some capacity, at what you\u2019re doing now, and then, somebody who is doing something you used to do, but is doing it much better than you did. And that was how he ended up seeking out people to surround himself with. How did you choose \u2013 since they all said yes, I guess you reached out to five or six people, right? M. Sanjayan: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How did you choose those people? What were the criteria? M. Sanjayan: I wanted people I respected. So, that was sort of important to me. They had to be people I really respected. I wanted people who were not in my field because I had plenty of colleagues in my field. So, I\u2019ll give you some names. I don\u2019t think it matters that much. So, Tom Tierney, Bridge Span, he\u2019s also the chairman of the Nature Conservancy now. A really smart guy. He kind of gets how businesses should organize. He coached me on how to get the CEO job for Conservation International. And the tips he gave me were incredibly valuable, incredible. I never realized that you could actually coach your way into a job. And that guy really helped me do that. So, that was one. Paula Kerger, she\u2019s the president of PBS, amazing woman, very unusual. She was a development staff. So, she asked people for money and then, rose through the ranks and ended up running PBS. She\u2019s also across the road from my office, so, it\u2019s kind of easy to sometimes see her. Really smart, very thoughtful, wonderfully kind, generous person. A guy name Seth Neiman, Cross Point Venture Partners is one of his companies. He\u2019s also a race car driver. That guy interviews CEO\u2019s for a living. So, his whole job is about interviewing CEO\u2019s and deciding which ones he wants to bet on as a venture capital guy. Really useful for me as I\u2019m thinking about what qualities and attributes I want to strengthen as a CEO. So, I sort of looked at it that way as sort of this group of folks who could sort of help and guide. Tim Ferriss: Were they people you\u2019d had contact with before? M. Sanjayan: Yeah. They were all people who had somehow been in my orbit. And then, I thought, well, let\u2019s just try to make this formal, in some way. And let\u2019s just see if they would agree to do this. And they all said yeah, so long as you do that to me in return, which was a very nice, flattering thing. I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t work that way. But that\u2019s been very useful. And believe me, I did end up using that board when I went through the CEO search. So, 150 days ago, our founder who had been running Conservation International for 30 years stepped down. And I became the CEO. And last year, the board went through a very challenging process of trying to decide who the next CEO and what the next leadership team would look like. And it\u2019s a very scary moment for an organization because over half to the CEO\u2019s who come in after a founder fail. And, actually, if you want to get the job, you want to be the one in waiting. Seriously, that\u2019s what typically happens. New CEO comes in, they fail, and either the old CEO comes back, or the person in waiting kind of gets the role and then, runs it. So, it\u2019s fraught with challenges and dangers all over the place. And I really didn\u2019t think I would get it. I thought there was a chance I would get it. But I was really worried about it for lots of reasons, including my color, to be absolutely honest. And this mentoring group, honest to God, coached me. Them and a couple of other people really helped coach me through this. Tim Ferriss: Can you share any of the advice that they gave you? M. Sanjayan: Yeah. One really simple one. So, this is such an amazing thing, and I\u2019ve applied for other jobs before like kind of like the CEO or top level person job and not got that. Three times, in the past, I\u2019ve been rejected for that. I\u2019d get very close and then, somehow, either they talked me out of it, or I get rejected. Here\u2019s what I was doing. So, they would ask me, tell me about this. So, why do you want this job? And I\u2019m like well, I\u2019ve got a good career. I don\u2019t really need this, but if it was the right thing. You kind of had this kind of long, meandering story about saying I\u2019m not totally vested. Yeah, I could do this, but I could do lots of other things. And I actually feel that way, in a lot of ways. So, in a lot of ways, I think I\u2019m definitely \u2013 I didn\u2019t start my life thinking I want to be the CEO of Conservation International. It was never a dream. It was never a goal, never a goal. The goal was to have impact. I didn\u2019t really care how I had impact. But what these guys said to me was like one guy actually said this to me. He said that is not the right answer. I want you to repeat after me. Say I will walk through a wall to get this job. Say it. I\u2019m like really? Say it. He says, \u201cNow, when you go into that interview, they\u2019re going to ask you this question. And I want you to repeat this.\u201d So, he did, first question. Why do you want this job? Tell us what prepared you for this job. And I said, \u201cLet me make one thing clear. I will walk through a wall to get this job.\u201d And they all went, great. Because, guess what? Most times, when you\u2019re hiring people, and I do this all of the time, I hire people all of the time. And I\u2019m so amazed that I didn\u2019t listen to my own rule. You want someone who gives you the confidence that they will solve the problems that you don\u2019t want to deal with. You want someone coming in saying I got this. You don\u2019t want someone to come in and say I don\u2019t know if I really want it. Convince me. And you start negotiating at Day 1. You don\u2019t want to do that. It\u2019s a very, very, simple rule. So, whatever job you go for, start by saying let me be clear, I really want this job. I will walk through a wall to get this job. Now, let me tell you what makes me so great for this, and then, just lay it out. You can negotiate later. It\u2019s a really simple one. Tim Ferriss: When you sent the emails out to recruit this X Men team of mentors to form a structure, a couple of questions, and this won\u2019t go on for hours. Don\u2019t worry, guys. Even though it could, and it might later with tequila. I don\u2019t know why I keep thinking of tequila. We can psychoanalyze that later. Do you interact with these mentors as a group? Or is it all one to one? M. Sanjayan: It\u2019s one on one, although they know about each other. Getting them together as a group would be too difficult. Tim Ferriss: Impossible, yeah. Do you block out say a week every quarter just to schedule them in batches? M. Sanjayan: Yeah. I schedule it around travel that I have in their city. So, I do this as much as I can I person, unless I have a crisis or an emergency, and I just need to get on the phone. And then, they\u2019re always willing. I, literally, today, I had a little, minor crisis. I, literally, had a CEO of a company I don\u2019t want to name, but enormous company, he returned my call today. I\u2019m so floored. It\u2019s like I\u2019m so sorry it took me so long to get back to you. And I\u2019m like you\u2019re kidding me. Once you get that relationship with those few individuals, it does work. It can really work very well. Tim Ferriss: Did you say, hey, let\u2019s grab coffee and then, make the pitch in person? Or did you lay it out in email? M. Sanjayan: I made it \u2013 no, I don\u2019t think I did it by email. I think I did it all by phone or when I met them in person after the first coffee. So, the people I knew well, I did by phone. I\u2019ll tell you one thing though. I do take it sort of seriously. So, when I go to see them, there are two things that I never make informal, two things that I never make informal. One is when I talk to my board, my organization board, or my group of mentors\u2019 board, which means I put on a shirt. I kind of put on a jacket, if it\u2019s appropriate. Whatever way you want to do it, and it\u2019s not about dress code. But I\u2019m whatever way you want to do it, you want to make sure that they understand that you are using and taking their hour really seriously. So, just don\u2019t waste time with that. And the other thing I do, I always take seriously, when I ask people for money, something that I never do on the \u2013 I never ask someone for a donation or to fund Conservation International when I\u2019m having a drink with them, or when I\u2019m fly fishing with them or going on a hike with them because people don\u2019t want to be hit up all of the time. You want to just go do that and enjoy it and have fun. And then, you want to say can I meet with you at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon, or can I meet with you at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow or today or whatever it is. I want to just clean up, show up, and be straight about it. Tim Ferriss: I said last two questions like twenty questions ago. But when you\u2019re preparing for one of these meetings, what does it look like? You have 60 minutes with such and such super hot shot, what\u2019s the format of the hour? M. Sanjayan: It often depends. At this point, it depends on what the major thing that I\u2019m dealing with has been and what\u2019s been kind of bugging me on my mind that I really want. Tim Ferriss: Could you give an example, or is it too personal? M. Sanjayan: It\u2019s not a big surprise. Any time a founder leaves an organization, there are \u2013 so, here\u2019s a really legitimate answer. So, I was not the only internal candidate going for this job. There were two other very, very good candidates for this job as well. And they both could do this job. They both could be CEO\u2019s. And my No. 1 task, as soon as I knew I was going to get this job, was to figure out a way to keep them. It almost never happens. And think what you\u2019ve just done. You\u2019ve now lost the second best person to run your organization has just walked out your door. It almost never happens. So, that was something I prepared for, I thought about how I might try to approach it. I went to them, and I said this is a problem. It\u2019s a big problem. Tell me what I need to do to be able to do this. And they gave me \u2013 some of them, not all of them, different people, and you\u2019ve got to filter that advice. But the two individuals I went to gave me incredibly good advice that I followed to a T. And it served me well, I think it served me well, because both of those individuals are incredibly valuable and still part of Conservation International. Tim Ferriss: Well, on that note, I want to thank you for so much good advice. Ladies and gentlemen, M. Sanjayan.

like a little prince", "i had these amazing cakes like a battleship cake, entire zoo cake", "it was like that kind of cake", "and then, we went to sierra leone, and we had to flee sri lanka in the middle of the night because of trouble in the country", "and my mom actually packed, which is amazing i think back on it, a pound of flour and icing sugar because we came to sierra leone on december 4, and my birthday was on december 26", "and she knew this", "and so, out there, in the middle of the jungle, she baked me a cake", "it was a simple, little, round cake with chocolate frosting, which is like the simplest frosting you can get", "basically, you can make it almost anywhere", "and i didn\u2019t like it", "so, i was crying", "i was weeping", "i was unhappy about it", "my mother

cake like this", "and the monkey looks at me, and i look at the monkey, and we\u2019re both like \u2013 the monkey is like \u2013 and then, it jumps", "it jumps on the window sill and it flees, it goes, gone", "and i go screaming in, \u201cthe cake, the cake, my cake,\u201d like just that kind of thing", "my mom comes out", "she\u2019s like worried, petrified", "she\u2019d only been in the country for a few days, at that point, like 22 days, shaking me", "she\u2019s like are you okay, are you okay", "and i\u2019m like the cake, the cake", "she goes to the window, no cake there", "she goes to the window, and our house is on stilts to avoid flooding in the rain forest", "and she looks down, and the cake is down there", "and she turns to me, and she says, \u201cyou wicked, wicked child", "your birthday is cancelled forever", "we will never do birthday again", "just wait until your father comes home.\u201d and that was it", "and now, i\u2019m on the floor because, for a child, injustice is like the worst thing ever", "so, since then, birthdays have been really, really difficult for me", "it\u2019s also on december 26, which is not great for lots of reasons", "and so, it creates this gigantic sense of anxiety", "it\u2019s never good enough", "it carried right into adulthood", "it was very, very destructive to everyone around me", "and even today, by the way, when we get together with my family, there is discussion about whether i threw the cake out the window or not", "and this has what\u2019s happened to my mind", "i start thinking did i really see that monkey, or did i actually throw the cake", "i don\u2019t even know, after a while, which is sort of interesting", "anyway, that\u2019s a very long story, but that\u2019s it", "sorry", "that is a great story", "i want to hear the monkey\u2019s version of that story", "at some point, i\u2019ll track that monkey down", "that will be a really awkward podcast", "how did your parents, or how did your family, end up going to sierra leone, of all places", "m", "sanjayan: my dad got attacked in the middle of the night", "my parents are the mildest, meekest mannered asians you can possibly meet", "my dad is an accountant", "and even now, when i travel, in botswana or namibia or indonesia or colorado, aspen, the same advice", "don\u2019t talk to strangers", "be careful what you eat", "call", "it\u2019s the same kind of meek, careful advice", "but they had this one gigantic moment of courage, which i still don\u2019t understand because, even today, it would be a massive deal to do", "but these asians who never have left the country decided to pick up their 5-year-old and 1-year-old and, over a weekend, decide that the country was getting politically really bad", "and with two suitcases and only the jewelry my mother had, just left", "and the only place my dad had a job offer was in sierra leone as an accountant for a forestry company", "later on, his career just took off, and he did great", "but it just was this unbelievable thing", "and not just freetown", "this is like where ebola was recently", "this is where there was a 30 year civil war in sierra leone", "we didn\u2019t just go to the capital", "we went 200 miles in the interior and lived in like a tree house with, quite literally, monkeys, obviously, around us", "and i don\u2019t get that", "and i still ask them", "and they\u2019re like yeah, you know, we didn\u2019t have a choice", "just like the two lotteries you win", "the parents you have, that\u2019s one lottery", "you don\u2019t get to pick that", "i won that one", "and the country of your birth is your second lottery", "i sort of snuck into that one", "but those are the two things", "and steve is completely right", "all of the other things in your life tend not to matter as much as those two lotteries that you get", "so, let\u2019s talk about the factors \u2013 or maybe if you could describe for us how you ended up in science and then conservation", "m", "sanjayan: sure", "i always loved nature", "i loved animals", "i think all kids love nature and love things that move", "and, as you get older, it kind of gets beaten out of you", "you just stop encouraging to do that", "but my parents just let me do that because it was the only thing that was sort of around me", "and i fooled them for a long time thinking i was sort of in pre-med and kind of went further and further into that realm, until, eventually, very late in my \u2013 i had my master\u2019s and just getting into my phd, i sort of realized there\u2019s actually a career that was actually open to asians in thinking about the environment and thinking about conservation and thinking about actually saving the planet", "you could actually do that respectably so for most of your life and be okay with it", "it took a lot of convincing for that bigger family to get that", "once i got my phd, i tell a story of it, i went back to sri lanka", "and my grandmother, i overheard her telling her friend who is like across the wall, kind of leans over, and they have this conversation", "my grandson is back", "he\u2019s a doctor now, but not the kind that saves people", "and she had to add that, right", "and i started thinking about it", "and i\u2019m like isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re actually trying to do because, ultimately, it\u2019s all connected", "people need nature to thrive", "and that is one virtuous cycle", "but it was a fooling game", "and i bet many, many people who follow their \u201cpassion\u201d, sort of try to find their way do a lot of fooling around and fooling of other people, fooling of social circles", "i was just lucky, lucky, lucky enough that there was enough there", "and i finally realized that i could actually do this", "what was the triggering event", "you were getting, at the time, your master\u2019s and phd were in what", "m", "sanjayan: so, where were they", "the fields, what was the concentration", "m", "sanjayan: it was biology for my master\u2019s, and genetics for my phd", "and was there a conversation or a book or something that proved to you that conservation could be a path you could embrace", "or was it \u2013 m", "sanjayan: honestly, i wish there was something more epic on that", "i think there were two moments in my life where i made these big leaps", "the first was coming to america, deciding that i wanted to be here for graduate school or for my higher education", "and that was because of bruce springsteen, kid you not", "kid you not", "that\u2019s how we picked colleges back then because i didn\u2019t have the internet", "and i definitely didn\u2019t have any way of knowing why america would make sense for me", "very little concept of america", "but someone gave me that nebraska album", "and i remember looking at the cover of that album", "and something about that cover and something about the songs on that and the last song on that album", "and it just made you want to think of sort of endless possibilities and wide open spaces", "and it always felt confined in my life, confined by society or by whatever", "i was always a stranger in a strange land no matter where we moved because we moved around a lot throughout africa and sometimes into asia", "and i just felt that was a big leap", "taking the sort of bet to come to america", "and then, the second one, i think, had more to do with i had an amazing advisor, a guy named michael soul\u00e9 who was the father of conservation biology", "he really coined that word, and he put it on the map", "and 20 years ago, he was the guy", "and i was lucky enough to work with him", "i just cold called him and sort of pestered him until he took me on as a student", "and i think that made me realize there was a path there", "so, you mentioned this professor", "could you remind me of his last name, the pronunciation", "m", "sanjayan: soule, s-o-u-l- e", "now, i\u2019ve read that he told you your job as a graduate student was to train yourself as a critical thinker", "i believe, maybe that\u2019s the internet lying to me again, but \u2013 m", "sanjayan: no, so, what was true is i was eager to say things", "you thought that\u2019s what you did", "i wanted to go save wildlife", "and he said, \u201cno", "right now, your job is to just do a really good piece of science", "it\u2019s actually good advice", "do a really hard piece of work so that you\u2019d own it, and you\u2019d know that, once in your life, you could do that", "and there\u2019s time enough later to say things", "he tells me now that he might not have said that advice today", "but, at that time, it made an impression on me, and that\u2019s sort of what i did", "why wouldn\u2019t he give that advice today", "did he explain it", "m", "sanjayan: i think he is so distraught about what has happened in the last 20 or 30 years to our planet", "and so, am i", "and i think we all are really impatient", "and i keep waiting for other people to see something that i have seen", "and very, very few people around me, somehow, seem to have that gene turned on", "and i think that impatience is what sort of makes us sometimes be irrational, but other times just feel desperate", "so, the intention, just to take a step back so you guys have a meta context here \u2013 what are we doing", "that\u2019s the question of the evening", "so, initially, i was like you know what would be really fun", "is to have steve case come up, who is in the book, and ask him questions that aren\u2019t in the book", "and then, to have someone, you, come up and ask the questions that are in the book", "but then, of course, we got the birthday cake and the monkey, and we\u2019re off on a completely different landscape", "so, i\u2019m going to bounce around between questions that i\u2019m dying to ask but then the questions that i feel like would be fun to sprinkle throughout", "so, there\u2019s going to be very little connective tissue", "it\u2019s going to be like the worst edited movie you\u2019ve ever seen", "what purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in recent memory", "m", "sanjayan: that\u2019s a really hard question for me because i don\u2019t buy a lot of stuff", "i\u2019m a total snob when it comes to the stuff i own", "and the reason for that is because i travel incessantly", "and when i travel, i just have one bag, and i have to take it", "so, everything i own has to do like double duty", "and so, i\u2019m very, very, very picky about either simplifying or just taking exactly what i like", "so, i can\u2019t think of something really easy that comes to mind under $100.00 that i could just name", "ice breaker underwear", "ice breaker is a great company", "they produce amazing stuff all out of marina wool, a new zealand based company", "i think you and i both know the founder, jeremy moon", "and i like his person ethos, and his stuff works", "i don\u2019t get paid by his company or anything like that", "but that\u2019s probably the last under $100.00 purchase i made that i love", "do you have a go to bag", "you mentioned you have one bag", "have you vetted a lot of bags", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "so, i used to love this victoria knox bag", "they don\u2019t make it anymore", "it just kills you, right", "it really kills you", "you just figure out that there\u2019s something that works really well, and then, they go and change it", "it\u2019s like shoes, athletic shoes", "oh, my god, did they change it", "and there\u2019s a whole race to change it fast", "so, this is really a hard question because i now use a tumi bag, and i like it because i like the four wheels", "i also like the sturdiness of that bag", "it\u2019s heavy", "that\u2019s the downside on it", "but i\u2019m getting older, so, i can\u2019t really carry things on my back anymore, so, i need the four wheeled, tumi bag", "do you have a protocol for surviving or maintaining your sanity and health for really long flights", "like that flight from botswana where i ambushed you with this invitation", "is there anything special you do", "and i know friends who carry saline misters for their noses or wrap their heads in all sorts of weird contraptions to block out sound and light", "or do you just go out, and you\u2019re done", "m", "sanjayan: no, i try to be as comfortable as i possibly can during the flight", "it\u2019s just the usual stuff", "i try to get myself on the new time zone fast", "i\u2019m very strategic about when i drink coffee or anything like coffee or tea, very strategic about the timing on that", "i tend to fast a little bit on flights", "i don\u2019t eat a lot just because i can catch up later", "and it always makes me feel a little better", "i guess that\u2019s sort of it", "sometimes, you get \u2013 it depends", "i did this flight, and i\u2019ll be absolutely honest with you, i fly so much that, sometimes, i\u2019m flying in business class, especially for very, very long flights when i have to land there and get into meetings", "sometimes, i fly in economy", "i did this very long flight from sydney to johannesburg, and i\u2019m in the back of an old 747, middle seat with these two very nice but large samoan gentlemen", "and i decided \u2013 the plane hadn\u2019t even really taken off", "they both fell asleep", "and their hands kept falling into my lap, boom, like this", "and i had to lift and put it", "that kind of flight, you just have to completely do this mind shift", "so, i stripped all of my stuff off, got into my jeans and a t-shirt, curled up, made my little space, and then, i started playing this game", "so, all you have to do is think about what worst form of transportation you could be stuck in in that moment", "so, you just have to think this could be mombasa to kampala truck ride right now in the back of a local bus", "and you\u2019re like oh, my god, this would be so much better than that", "i can order food", "i can get drinks", "just infinitely better, infinitely better", "so, that\u2019s the trick", "i once had to spend an entire month in a very small cabin on a boat, no windows", "it\u2019s a research vessel", "i\u2019m stuck in there with another roommate, tiny, for a month", "and we had food, literally, cans of food under our bed", "that\u2019s how small the whole \u2013 but i kept thinking this is like a sleeper suite on singapore airlines like a $20,000.00 ticket right now because i can sleep", "there\u2019s a shower", "i can walk around", "and it just makes you feel so much better", "so, that\u2019s the trick with distance", "any time there\u2019s space constraint, just think of what\u2019s worse and then just mind shift", "it works", "no, it sounds like a fantastic trick", "i\u2019m still thinking about the thick samoan hands landing in your lap", "if you were to \u2013 we were talking about one of your mentors and the advice he gave you", "if you were to have the opportunity to teach say, i\u2019ll give you three options, a ninth grade class, college freshmen class, or college senior class, you choose one of those three and to teach a seminar or class of your choosing, what age would you choose, and what would you teach for a semester", "m", "sanjayan: so, tell me again how old people are at ninth grade because i didn\u2019t go to school here", "ninth grade is 14 or 15, i would say", "fourteen probably", "m", "sanjayan: i\u2019d probably teach that freshmen seminar class", "freshmen college", "m", "sanjayan: freshmen college", "because i think i have relatable experiences that i can translate to that group, and it\u2019s still early enough for their trajectory to make a big difference", "so, that\u2019s probably why i\u2019d pick that group", "and what would i teach", "yeah", "what would the class be", "and it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 there\u2019s no pre-req", "there\u2019s no \u2013 m", "sanjayan: it would be like how to get shit done", "this is a good subject", "m", "sanjayan: it\u2019s like so much stuff that we learned in college is wasted", "you just think about the vast amount of stuff that they taught us that we never, ever actually use", "so, i would probably teach a class, being really honest because i do teach at universities", "so, it would probably be something about biology and something about the environment", "so, chances are it will be in that vein", "it might be a class in communication because i\u2019ve done enough television work and stuff like that to be able to do that legitimately so or storytelling", "but i would probably teach a class in biology", "but if i really could get away with it, i would do something like all of the things you wish you\u2019d known getting into this, or how to organize your life to get stuff done", "and it would be kind of in that vain", "i\u2019d actually just, basically, take some of your books, crib it, regurgitate it", "so, i want to ask both about the getting shit done freshmen seminar, but let\u2019s just, as a thought exercise, if it were, instead, so, you don\u2019t have to think about the entire semester, if it were just a three to four hour seminar, what would be some of the key principles or strategies or anything that you would want to hammer home", "m", "sanjayan: you\u2019re getting me after a really long flight, so, my brain is \u2013 and we could also buy some time by asking you what you would teach in a storytelling class", "m", "sanjayan: so, stay with the first one", "or \u2013 no, i\u2019m kidding", "m", "sanjayan: so, what was the question, again, sorry", "the question was, if you have a three to four hour seminar on getting shit done, what are some of the \u2013 any of the key messages or strategies of anything that you would emphasize", "because you get a lot done", "i\u2019ve observed how much you do, and it boggles my mind", "i don\u2019t know how you stand in one piece", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "so, there\u2019s some of the principles that you\u2019d probably want to get into are dealing with focus", "so, this is a major challenge, especially for younger people", "and it\u2019s not getting any better", "and i have the ability, and it\u2019s not because i have some magical ability, it\u2019s just because i practice it, of intensely focusing on one thing for a few seconds or for a few minutes", "and i think that ability to intensely focus on something and not be distracted from anything else is a very useful habit to have", "and so, i\u2019m very good at \u2013 when you\u2019re one on one, you can be one on one, and you can be very focused", "and i think that\u2019s true for storytelling", "i think that\u2019s true for really getting information out of people", "and i think helping people focusing on one thing and then, switching to another, so a serial focus, is a very, very useful practice", "i think that we waste enormous amounts of time pretending to work", "and we can just sort of get rid of that whole thing", "i think we\u2019re not honest with ourselves about what we\u2019re really good at and what we\u2019re not good at", "and very early, success to light is being absolutely, brutally honest about what you\u2019re not good at", "and you can compensate for it, in some ways", "but just don\u2019t \u2013 ask people what do you think you\u2019re good at", "and they\u2019ll sort of tell you their resume, or they\u2019ll recite you that \u2013 and that\u2019s not particularly useful", "i\u2019ll tell them about the things that i wish i had \u2013 i think every student going through should take a class in ethics", "i think every student going through should take a class on communications and storytelling", "i think every student who goes through should think about how, during their four year or whatever their college term is, spending a little time working on something that is completely unrelated to their primary area of interest", "that was probably the best thing i ever did when i was going through the american education system is that, during the summers, i was restricted on what jobs i could do because i was a foreign student", "i would go and work at the world bank", "and for a biologist to be walking around at the world bank was a very strange thing, at the time", "and it was unbelievably useful to me", "it was like the most useful thing i did, really", "why was it useful", "m", "sanjayan: because it put me in touch with a whole bunch of people who were completely unlike me and would think about the world in completely different terms", "i\u2019d go in there, and they\u2019d be like you must be an economist", "and i\u2019d be like no, i\u2019m a wildlife biologist", "and they\u2019d be like wow, that\u2019s crazy", "what are you doing here", "but i just started realizing how they worked and how a whole different set of rules applied and how a whole other institution was working on problems", "and it just opened my eyes", "the easiest thing would have been for me to go work for a nonprofit like the one i work for now, a conservation [inaudible]", "i didn\u2019t do that", "i really, particularly, went and got jobs in areas that had nothing, nothing to do with my primary area of interest just to see what it looked like", "and the best \u2013 the funnest things in the world are all on those angles when you can bring two different fields together", "there\u2019s so much gold in those angles", "you do that all of the time, actually", "and i\u2019ve really \u2013 learning how to exploit that is often your little trick to getting a head start", "it makes me think, also, of career advice that i\u2019ve heard from both scott adams, creator of dilbert, and also mark andreessen in different senses", "but they\u2019ve said, this is more scott adams and his writing, that there are different ways to \u201csucceed\u201d", "one is you can try to be say top 1 percent of 1 percent like a michael jordan in one skill", "that\u2019s really, really, really difficult", "the other approach is that you can be say in the top 10 percent in 2 typically uncombined areas", "so, you have scott adams who would say himself, he\u2019s not the best artist", "he\u2019s not the best comedian", "but he\u2019s unusually good at combining both of those things", "and, in the world of business, it could be a jd plus computer science, or softer skills", "and i\u2019ve heard warren buffet talk about his best ever investment being i believe it was toast masters or some equivalent public speaking course because you layer that on top of almost anything, and it automatically puts you in a position to have a really unfair advantage", "so, storytelling, you were kind enough, we were trading before this, and you mentioned storytelling so, this is one thing i highlighted of notes that you sent to me, which was storytelling was one way to rule the world", "and another friend of mine who has been on the podcast, chris sacca who is just an incredible investor, hilarious guy, but he originally trained to be a lawyer", "and he was beaten soundly, at one point, by this guy who got \u2013 after chris had presented all of his spreadsheets and all of the data, and some guy got up, i think it was in arkansas or texas or somewhere, and he was like you can\u2019t lead a horse to water or something", "he just started speaking in five or six different parables and completely kicked chris\u2019s ass", "and so, chris concluded that stories beat spreadsheets", "how have you developed your ability to tell stories", "or how would you recommend people develop, perhaps, books, tools, practices, the ability to tell better stories because i think it\u2019s, as you\u2019ve said, so, so, so powerful", "m", "sanjayan: right", "so, i really agree with what you just said", "and i think storytelling is one really powerful way to kind of rule the world", "and a lot of people that we kind of look up to and think about like from einstein to elon musk to steve jobs, they were really powerful storytellers, in their own way", "so, they had this ability through words or through images to really convince you that you could do something that no one else could think about", "and just that mind shift that they created propelled you along with their vision", "and, all of a sudden, you were doing it", "so, and you absolutely learn those skills", "you can actually get better at it", "when i was in high school, i was painfully shy", "like painfully shy", "i wore very thick glasses", "i had long hair", "i did get beaten up all of the time", "i went to school, for my high school, i went to school, it was like hogwarts\u2019s without any of the magic", "so, it was tough", "but i had a break", "and the break was, this is such a funny break, so, i was sent to boarding school in england for a year", "and the break was that we had a debate team, which was quite good", "and it would go up against like eaton and all of the other schools like that", "and the kid who was supposed to be the main kid for this debate team got ill", "and they suggested that i fill that role, and i did", "and i really had to \u2013 the first time i did this, they make fun of my accent because i had a bit of an accent", "i didn\u2019t actually have much of an accent, but in their minds, i had a very strong asian accent", "and what i did was i started the debate with that very, very strong \u2013 i over emphasized", "everyone laughed at me", "i laughed at myself", "i got over it", "and i moved on", "that\u2019s not a big deal to do today", "but when you\u2019re 14 or 15, it feels big and scary and really hard to do", "and i realized there was power in that", "by the way, we went all the way to the finals, and this kid then got well", "and then, they kicked me off the team", "and then, this kid actually lost", "i\u2019m not saying anything here, but this is exactly what happens in my life", "literally, three debates, three rounds we were doing fine", "the team was doing great", "okay", "he had chicken pox", "and then, he was out of quarantine, so, he could come back on the team", "and then, i was off", "so, you can practice, and you can get better", "so, i practiced", "and i think about it, and i think about how people tell stories", "look at tim\u2019s \u2013 you open those first couple of pages, and he talks that little story that he puts in there about what he was grappling with in his college days", "it immediately captivates you", "you just immediately want to know more and read more", "so, there\u2019s real power there", "and you can develop and get better at it", "so, what are some of the ways in which you can do this", "so, you have to be genuinely interested in the stories you\u2019re telling", "you can\u2019t fake that", "if you\u2019re interviewing someone, you\u2019ve got to be actually a fan of that person", "if you\u2019re not a fan of that topic or that person or not genuinely interested, it\u2019s just not going to work", "you\u2019ve got to own that story", "it\u2019s got to be all you", "you can\u2019t bluff the story", "you can\u2019t lie about it", "you can learn a story and repeat someone else\u2019s story", "but you really have to own it in like a deep, deep sense of it", "you have to know when to stop", "you have to know when to \u2013 the message is also important", "that\u2019s something i often say", "it\u2019s not just the story, but it\u2019s also the kind of stories you tell, and they have to be true to who you are as a storyteller", "so, i\u2019m not a professional at like teaching people how to tell stories", "i can\u2019t do that professionally", "i know i do it", "i know i practice it", "i got it from my parents", "i think it\u2019s a wonderful craft to think about", "read books and figure out what piece of that is really catching your heart", "it always starts with the heart", "it always comes from a place of commonality and laughter and love or pain or something from the heart before you can engage the mind", "and those sorts of stories always tend to win", "so, i want to underscore something you said", "and then, i want to ask about this very, very clear smirk that came on your face when you just said something a second ago", "but i think the going for the heart or noticing what captures the heart applies to questions, too.\u00a0 for instance", "cal fussman who was one of the main writers of the what i learned column in esquire for a long, long, long time, i want to say 10 plus interviews, interviewed gorbachev and all of these people routinely would get told, right before an interview, yeah, this hour long interview, you now have five minutes", "and so, he would have to hook someone like gorbie into continuing to talk", "and he\u2019d think about his questions", "and then, he\u2019d say tell me about when your father left for war", "was there any particular lesson he taught you", "and he would go for the emotion first", "and that would then allow him to get to the headier questions later", "so, i think that it applies to not only the telling of stories, but the asking, the eliciting of stories", "m", "sanjayan: and good storytelling is that, right", "so, in a good story, a really phenomenal story is one way you actually are having this relationship with the audience", "and it\u2019s a two-way story", "and when people do that magically, you\u2019re a whole other kind of level of it", "and when you talk about how you organize your questions, it sounds so simple", "like okay, he\u2019s got a bunch of questions", "but there\u2019s so much thought going into it because you\u2019re actually engaging a story", "and you\u2019re doing it in that way so that you can get the whole thing kind of coming out, right", "yeah", "absolutely", "and the piece that i wanted to ask about, and maybe it was just because you enjoy smiling and do it so well, but you said you have to know when to stop", "and then, i think you had this big grin on your face", "maybe that was me noticing something that wasn\u2019t there", "but what\u2019s behind knowing when to stop", "what\u2019s the opposite", "what does that look like", "just telling a long story that goes on too long", "m", "sanjayan: so, the best storytellers leave you wanting to hear more", "the best comedians just absolutely will leave you wanting to hear more", "there\u2019s a real art to that", "you can\u2019t give it all away", "you have to leave the audience saying i wanted to hear \u2013 tell me more", "and that\u2019s really important about knowing when to be able to stop", "and you can over explain things many, many ways", "and i\u2019m really not articulate today, by the way", "i\u2019m apologizing a little bit for that", "but that\u2019s a really important skill to know like when does that story end", "don\u2019t bury the punchline", "so many times, it\u2019s like there\u2019s a whole wind up where i\u2019m going to tell you a story about a monkey that stole my \u2013 don\u2019t do that", "just go right into it because you have them at the first minute", "and then, every minute after that, you\u2019re going to start losing audience share, so, you want to get it fast and get right into it as fast as you can", "so, i want to talk about \u2013 m", "sanjayan: by the way, can i tell you one thing about that", "yes, of course", "m", "sanjayan: so, when i was talking about the message about owning a story, go do this when you get a chance, when you get home", "you know that song respect, r-e-s-p-e-c-t", "you know that song, right", "so, who sang that", "aretha franklin", "everyone knows aretha franklin", "everyone can hum it right now", "if i played it to you, you\u2019d know it in a heartbeat", "she\u2019s not the one who actually first sang it", "it was actually done by otis redding", "same words, same song, very different meaning", "the song is really exact opposite of what aretha makes that song to be", "otis redding\u2019s song is like i\u2019m working all day, woman, and i\u2019m putting food on the table for you", "and when i fucking come home \u2013 i\u2019m so sorry i said that", "no, no, no", "curse away", "m", "sanjayan: i think it\u2019s in this song, when i come home, all i want is just some god damn respect", "that\u2019s his song", "never made it big, but otis redding was a big singer by then", "a decent blues song", "she owned it", "she completely \u2013 same words, but just the way she put that story together, her complete ownership of it", "and who will forget her spelling of that just makes her the one who remembers it", "and later on in life, otis actually kind of complained slightly about her taking the song and making it so huge and no one remembers that he\u2019s the one who recorded and sang it and performed it for at least two years before she came along", "so, you want to see two stories, same story, told in different ways, listen to those two songs", "that\u2019s amazing", "i had no idea", "i want to talk about some of the stories, and the stories may not be the right word, but narratives that have stuck with you", "and i\u2019m going to prompt it with a question", "and i can certainly cheat a little bit and prompt", "but what is the book or books you\u2019ve given the most as a gift and why", "or books that have influenced you", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "tim and i have talked about this a little bit", "so, for me, books are all about the moment and the emotion that i\u2019m in and the person i\u2019m giving it to is in", "and so, i can\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s one book that has predominated how i give because i love books, and i love to give books", "and i carry books around", "even today, i brought two books for you to autograph that i\u2019m giving away", "so, there\u2019s an act of giving", "and a book is a wonderful way to convey something to another person", "books that i\u2019ve loved giving away, norman mcclain\u2019s a river runs through it", "i read that book in so many different ways, in so many pieces", "it totally influenced my life in terms of fly fishing and finding magic in words and that quiet space", "he also wrote that book when he was 71 years old", "kind of only the really big book he wrote", "it was at 71", "and you think about all of this sort of bullshit about creative genius being in the young and all of that", "as you get older, you start appreciating it", "if norman could do it at 71, maybe i could do it not quite at 71 yet", "another book i really liked, a more recent book, is stanley mcchrystal\u2019s team of teams", "completely different reason", "just a really clever, smart book about how to organize businesses and enterprises for today\u2019s world", "and he takes this experiential army in afghanistan and brings it over to sort of your life or my life and makes it kind of relevant and meaningful", "i found it very influential", "i\u2019ve given away quite a few copies of james nester\u2019s book, the deep, which you might have read, right", "you\u2019ve read his book", "i haven\u2019t read the deep", "m", "sanjayan: that book is pretty damn good", "it\u2019s about free diving, which i knew nothing about", "that was one of my birthday things", "that was like two years ago", "so, i thought i\u2019ll try this free diving thing because i read nester\u2019s book", "and it\u2019s amazing, the physiology of the human body and what it can do is amazing", "so, i read this book", "it\u2019s about free diving, a very scary, it can be a very dangerous sport, but also an amazing sport because it completely changes the way you think about your body and what you\u2019re capable of", "and i thought this book inspired me", "i\u2019m going to go try and take a lesson in free diving", "so, i went to hawaii around my birthday, and i took a lesson from a very, very good \u2013 you want to do this with someone very, very good, and i did", "and this woman, shelly eisenberg, who was my teacher for the day, basically, this is what she did", "within three hours, i could hold my breath for maybe 45 seconds, maybe a minute if i tried", "within three hours, three hours, just by doing exercises with me, she had me at two minutes, ten seconds", "that floored me", "it would be like saying how fast can you run around, i\u2019d be like i can do a nine minute mile", "and you say give me three hours, and i\u2019ll get you down to a six minute", "you just couldn\u2019t do that", "and that floored me", "and she\u2019s like yeah, let\u2019s keep going", "and sure enough, you\u2019re doing three minutes", "you\u2019re doing three minutes within twenty-four hours", "unbelievable", "true story, you can do it", "everyone in here can do that, too", "that\u2019s why that book was so kind of mentally transformative", "i feel obligated as the person who is certainly not a doctor, and you\u2019ve heard this before, i don\u2019t play one on the internet", "but you have to be very, very careful with this type of training", "so, do not take the diy approach", "i know people who have died", "and i know people who have come very close to dying from shadow water black outs", "and when you, depending on the technique, if you blow off a lot of co2, you won\u2019t sense that you\u2019re going to black out before you black out", "you\u2019re fine, and then, you\u2019re blacked out, which you don\u2019t really want to have happen in any amount of water", "you could jimi hendrix yourself, or it could be in 1,000 feet of water, same outcome", "so, be very, very careful only with supervision, but it is fascinating", "m", "sanjayan: i mean, two navy seals drowned in a training exercise in san diego like two years ago, just the two of them trying this out and breaking the rules", "the no", "1 with this is you\u2019re doing it with a buddy who can do this better than you can", "and you definitely want to do this, and that\u2019s why i didn\u2019t just try this", "i read this book", "then, i went and got one of the best teachers, and i spent time with her", "and that\u2019s why i think it\u2019s amazing", "billboards, let\u2019s talk about them", "if you could have a giant billboard anywhere with anything on it \u2013 m", "sanjayan: a giant what", "billboard, with a message that you would get out to millions and billions of people, what would it say, and why", "m", "sanjayan: i\u2019m going to take an easy one", "i\u2019m going to use one of the slogans that we at conservation international use, in some ways, which i would probably say something like either people need nature", "that\u2019s not obvious enough", "i\u2019d say nature is speaking", "or i might say nature is screaming", "and i\u2019d like to put those outside of every place where there\u2019s this \u201cnatural disaster\u201d, which is usually human disaster that was exacerbated by just not listening to nature", "that\u2019s what i\u2019d do", "and i was always influenced by you drive across this country; you see these signs for religious purposes", "so and so deity will do this to you or not do this to you if only you believe", "and i always thought why don\u2019t we put that same kind of effort into putting billboards up that says nature is screaming or nature is speaking", "when are we going to listen", "something like that", "so, that\u2019s probably what i\u2019d put on it", "so, i really want to, and this isn\u2019t just professional courtesy, so we can talk about the work you\u2019re doing", "conservation and the state of progressive destruction of our natural habitats and surroundings causes me a lot of anxiety personally", "in part because i feel like, for instance, if a study comes out on metabolism, and there are a bunch of conflicting headlines, and things are poorly interpreted by certain media, i can parse it", "i can go to [inaudible]", "i can figure out what\u2019s what", "but, in the world of conservation or trying to do the right thing, i sometimes feel lost, in the sense that i attempt to do the right thing, what i perceive to be the right thing, and then, i find out, oh, shit, that type of wild caught fish or farmed fish is exactly the opposite of what i should be doing or whatever it might be", "you\u2019re going to have a lot of people listening to this, people in this room, and then, people on the podcast", "if people want to think more precisely about this and feel like they can take proactive steps, what are some of the most common misconceptions about conservation", "or what\u2019s a smart way to just approach thinking about it", "m", "sanjayan: right", "so, the first thing i would say is, don\u2019t let perfection and trying to find the silver bullet keep you out of the game", "so, we were both, recently, at summit in los angeles", "and i heard people talk about philanthropy and giving and wanting to find the most perfect way to give", "and i was sort of struck by how many people around me were all nodding", "and i was just thinking to myself really", "yeah, okay, i want to make sure my dollar goes the furthest as well", "but there are so many other things in life, which we waste all of the time, and why this one we want perfection", "so, when someone says to me tell me the one thing i can do to change the planet, guess what, there isn\u2019t", "there are lots of things", "and it\u2019s messy", "and you\u2019re not always going to get it right", "and is it better to drink out of ceramic cup that you have to wash in hot water or a styrofoam cup", "those are important questions for you to think about", "but, ultimately, they shouldn\u2019t stop you from getting engaged", "so, the truth of the matter is very, very, very few people are actually engaged in trying to care about the fate of our planet, the fate of where we live and our kids\u2019 lives", "and i just want to get more people in it", "and i think if more are in it, then, absolutely, we\u2019ll come up with more honed solutions", "but it shouldn\u2019t stop you from getting in it", "so, that\u2019s my first thing i would say", "if you want to make some small changes in your life, what you eat and how you cook it makes a huge difference", "it\u2019s probably the one thing that you could do", "so, being thoughtful whether it\u2019s farm caught or wild", "that\u2019s a useful question to think about and try to get the best half way there", "and i can answer that for you", "like seafood watch that the monterey bay aquarium puts out gives you a reasonable pathway", "but how you cook and how you waste food, like wasting food, is a big, big deal", "your energy output on those completely outweighs what car you drive or anything like that", "so, that\u2019s just something simple you can do", "getting engaged in the political system, i think it really does matter", "it really does matter", "so, there was this kind of crazy decision very recently on wanting to, at this moment in time, when all of these crises are going on on the planet, on overturning the ban on importing elephant heads from trophy hunting from zimbabwe and zambia", "that actually somehow became a priority for the administration all of a sudden", "we\u2019re going to overturn the ban so that any hunter who goes to zimbabwe or zambia and shoots an elephant can bring the ivory and the head into the country", "why is that all of a sudden, the thing to do", "and people really got upset about it", "and, believe it or not, it kind of did change something, at least for now", "there\u2019s been a reversal of that decision", "so, the administration has decided to wait on that for a while", "so, make your voices heard", "it\u2019s important that you make your voices heard", "and don\u2019t sit this out", "are there any other resources that you would suggest people look to, like seafood watch, or any other websites where people could find simple things they might not think of like the slower shipping to make an impact", "just assuming these people are busy professionals with high demands on their time, where do you suggest they look", "m", "sanjayan: okay", "and without being totally self serving", "so, i will say my own organization, conservation.org, decent website", "you\u2019ll find lots of ways in which you can be engaged", "the nature conservancy, nature.org, decent website", "lots of ways you can get engaged", "environmental defense fund, they do a lot of great work, particularly in the united states around climate", "world resource institute gives you the macro picture", "they have great graphics, great infographics", "it gives you sort of the macro picture", "i did a series, recently, on vox with the university of california called climate labs, which are just these eight minute, very short, digestible, little videos on something like food waste", "slightly irreverent, slightly counterintuitive, simple ways in which you can either get engaged or make a change in your life", "you can have an impact", "and so, we took a bunch of different topics like shipping and did the short videos on it", "it\u2019s called climate labs on vox", "so, those are things that come quickly to mind", "but here\u2019s the most important thing, seriously", "i really mean this we really are on a race to save the planet", "i really, really believe this", "here\u2019s the thing", "we\u2019re the only generation who actually has some foresight", "think about this", "in the entire history of humanity, we had to rely on crystal balls and a burning bush sitting where we are to give us a glimpse of where we\u2019re heading", "and now, we actually have some data", "we\u2019re the first generation in human history to see the \u2013 i met john glen before he passed away", "amazing guy", "amazing american", "first american to go around the planet, see the whole thing", "i asked him, and he said, \u201cyeah, it blew me away", "i never thought we could see the whole planet all at once.\u201d if you were standing on a flat earth, if you\u2019re standing on the sea shore, you see about seven miles", "after that, the horizon dips away", "and as long as humans have been around, we\u2019ve been climbing taller and taller mountains, towers, trees to be able to see what\u2019s over the horizon", "what are we looking for", "we\u2019re thinking about a lion that\u2019s over the horizon that might bite us, or looking for opportunity", "now, in our generation, we can see the whole thing", "and not only that, we\u2019re also mostly all connected", "there is no reason for us not to act right now", "and believe me, that window is small", "and if we don\u2019t do it, i swear, future generations will look back and say what a waste", "you had that opportunity when the opportunity cost was actually relatively cheap", "the price of conservation will never get cheaper in the future", "it\u2019s as cheap as it\u2019s going to get now, and it will only get more expensive", "so, not acting now is crazy", "and that\u2019s why people who have done the giving pledge like steve case and others, i so applaud that because they\u2019re not just saying we\u2019re going to leave this for future generations to deal with", "they\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to deal with it now because, right now, is probably the cheapest to be able to deal with it", "so, i\u2019ll ask just a few more questions, and then, we\u2019ll do some audience", "and then, we\u2019ll head off to tequila shots or whatever comes next", "but i really want to ask you what you found helpful for training humans to think more long term because it strikes me that, if you look at history, and you don\u2019t have to go very far back, but you certainly could, we\u2019ve evolved from millions of years, effectively, to survive until puberty, have sex, and procreate", "that\u2019s basically it", "that\u2019s darwinism at work", "and people act in their intensely worst of interests long term for short term gain", "how do you train people to think more in longer term time horizons and in ways that are more communal and not individual", "it seems like a very tough task but a very, very, very important one", "what are some of the most effective learnings or lessons that you\u2019ve had with that", "m", "sanjayan: so, i don\u2019t know", "that\u2019s the truth of the answer", "i don\u2019t know how to fundamentally beat evolutionary biology", "it is so hard wired into us", "the people who do and do it rationally, so, you look at what charlie munger says", "he says, basically, our investment technique that he and buffet used is just don\u2019t do anything stupid over the long run", "pretty much he basically says that, right", "it\u2019s surprisingly simple but incredibly hard to follow, incredibly hard to follow", "and the people who do it tend to be sort of investors and others who sort of faithfully follow a system", "but even they get spooked, as we\u2019ve seen many, many times over", "so, it\u2019s very difficult to beat it", "so, i\u2019m not trying to do that", "i\u2019m just trying to figure out how i can make you change your life for the betterment of the planet in your own enlightened self interest", "and the better i can do that and tell you that it\u2019s actually going to make your life better now, now, now, now, not even your kids, but your life, the better chance i have of promoting change", "the interesting thing is it doesn\u2019t have to be rational because we do so many things that are completely irrational", "and so, it doesn\u2019t have to be rational", "it can be very emotional", "and it has to be about your own enlightened self interest", "it can\u2019t be about the future", "so, i think, at some point, we\u2019ll have to do a round 2", "m", "sanjayan: and i\u2019m stuck", "and any help you have and want to throw it my way, our way, we\u2019ll take it", "but i\u2019m actually stuck because i know much better communiques than i am and far smarter people than i am in my field who are, basically, stuck as well", "to that point, my next question is going to be what ask would you have of people listening", "is there anything that you\u2019re looking for, any particular type of help, or just next steps that people \u2013 you would like to see people take because you\u2019re going to have a lot of people listening, people in all different walks of life, different sectors, every possible place imaginable", "what would you like them to do or consider", "m", "sanjayan: so, the most important thing you could do for me or for us or for this cause is to be a messenger", "it really is, quite simply, that because the people who are more likely to listen are people like yourselves", "they\u2019re more likely to listen to the message coming from you than if it came from me", "and that\u2019s really \u2013 so, i strongly believe in that", "so, the messenger matters as much as the message", "you can reach audiences that i could never reach", "so, being that messenger, to carry that message into your community, into your church or synagogue, your place of worship, your school, your community, your family is far, far more useful than me trying to just get my voice to be bigger and bigger and bigger", "thank you", "and where can people say hello to you on social or learn more about what you\u2019re up to", "is twitter the best place", "m", "sanjayan: twitter is a good place", "facebook is also really good because it allows a longer conversation to occur", "i can easily be found as m sanjayan on facebook", "and that\u2019s a good place to also engage", "twitter is fine, too", "and then, conservation.org", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "and conservation.org", "i think our website and our social media platform is a great place to engage", "perfect", "m", "sanjayan: particularly for a dc audience, but i think also for a global audience", "so, this is, i think, a great place to grab just a few questions", "and then, we can close up and have some tequila, give george clooney a few hundred million more dollars, if anybody knows the [inaudible], what a story", "m", "sanjayan: by the way, while he\u2019s thinking about that, one other book i wanted to mention to you guys, especially for this town, is a book called destiny of the republic by candace millard", "it\u2019s a fantastic book", "she\u2019s a great author, and she talks about president garfield and being shot and how his life could have been saved, if they had only listened to the surgeon who gave them advice, but he was sort of ignored because he was this black surgeon in the union army", "and, instead, they took another route, and it\u2019s just a fascinating story about race and technology at the cusp of a really important moment in our nation", "about a president that very few people had heard about but who, if he had survived, would have completely changed the course of our country probably for the better", "so, this is a question from bill from long island", "it\u2019s addressed to me, but i\u2019m going to ask you, since i\u2019ve talked ad nauseum about my mornings", "what does the first 60 to 90 seconds of your day look like", "i\u2019m going to modify this", "but he\u2019s asking what do you do to jump start the first waking moments", "do you have any morning rituals or routines that are consistent for you", "m", "sanjayan: coffee", "yeah", "to jump start my day", "yeah", "or just anything that you do as part of your routine in the mornings", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "so, i often put the toughest things i need to deal with and the most creative things early in the morning", "it\u2019s just as simple as that", "i tend not to check my email until i\u2019m actually starting work", "that\u2019s just something i \u2013 my work email, until i\u2019m actually starting work because it just really clutters the mind", "so, what happens with email, especially for my company because it\u2019s a global organization, so, i get emails in the middle of the night", "and so, they pile up", "and so, if i find out that if i open my day by checking email, i get diverted into all of these other small things that i am very bad at saying no to", "so, i kind of ruin the rest of that day", "and rather, i want to sort of set my agenda, then, look at it, and deal with the ones i can deal with and ignore the others", "this is a question from it\u2019s either eric or erin, i\u2019m not quite sure", "who is your most recent mentor, and what has that person taught you", "and if you have an answer for that, great", "otherwise, we could modify it to just be what is a recent lesson that you\u2019ve learned or insight", "m", "sanjayan: that\u2019s a good one because it kind of harkens back to tribe of mentors", "so, one of the things that i did that i found very, very useful in my life, and i think, for many of you, you could apply it, too, is that, some years ago, i created a personal board", "so, a group of individuals who would personally spend a little bit of time vesting in my and my success", "and i didn\u2019t do this because of some grandiose notion of who i was", "but it struck me that, whenever you wanted letters of reference when you go for a job, you always have to sort of scramble around and try to catch up to people who you haven\u2019t spoken to for a long time and hope they give you this letter", "and they really don\u2019t know you, by that point, and life has sort of gone by", "and i thought what happens if i had a group of five individuals that i would pick, and i would make a promise that i would never solicit them for money, which i have kept up, even though some now do give to ci, but that\u2019s not the purpose", "they don\u2019t belong to my organization", "they\u2019re not my board for my organization", "they\u2019re my personal board", "and they\u2019re great people", "and i would just say to them, listen, can you do this for me", "i\u2019ll meet with you two, maybe three times a week", "we\u2019ll have coffee or lunch", "two or three times a week", "m", "sanjayan: i\u2019m sorry, two or three times a year", "it\u2019s like man, this is a really generous board", "m", "sanjayan: sorry", "and we\u2019ll just have a little conversation and a catch up", "and i can just occasionally ping you for guidance", "that has been incredibly, incredibly useful", "i picked some great people", "you might know some of them", "but it\u2019s been very, very helpful", "okay", "so, i want to dig into this because this is really interesting", "so, your personal board", "m", "sanjayan: by the way, they all said yes", "not one person turned me down", "how could we not get into this", "now, i want to mention, just as a side note because people might find this helpful, something that i found very helpful from chris fussell who co-authored team of teams with stan mcchrystal", "and he was stan\u2019s aide-de-camp for quite a long time in jsoc", "and advice he was given was, at all times, you want to surround yourself with at least three people", "someone who is doing an excellent job of what you hope to be doing say a few years from now, someone who is doing a better job than you are, in some capacity, at what you\u2019re doing now, and then, somebody who is doing something you used to do, but is doing it much better than you did", "and that was how he ended up seeking out people to surround himself with", "how did you choose \u2013 since they all said yes, i guess you reached out to five or six people, right", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "how did you choose those people", "what were the criteria", "m", "sanjayan: i wanted people i respected", "so, that was sort of important to me", "they had to be people i really respected", "i wanted people who were not in my field because i had plenty of colleagues in my field", "so, i\u2019ll give you some names", "i don\u2019t think it matters that much", "so, tom tierney, bridge span, he\u2019s also the chairman of the nature conservancy now", "a really smart guy", "he kind of gets how businesses should organize", "he coached me on how to get the ceo job for conservation international", "and the tips he gave me were incredibly valuable, incredible", "i never realized that you could actually coach your way into a job", "and that guy really helped me do that", "so, that was one", "paula kerger, she\u2019s the president of pbs, amazing woman, very unusual", "she was a development staff", "so, she asked people for money and then, rose through the ranks and ended up running pbs", "she\u2019s also across the road from my office, so, it\u2019s kind of easy to sometimes see her", "really smart, very thoughtful, wonderfully kind, generous person", "a guy name seth neiman, cross point venture partners is one of his companies", "he\u2019s also a race car driver", "that guy interviews ceo\u2019s for a living", "so, his whole job is about interviewing ceo\u2019s and deciding which ones he wants to bet on as a venture capital guy", "really useful for me as i\u2019m thinking about what qualities and attributes i want to strengthen as a ceo", "so, i sort of looked at it that way as sort of this group of folks who could sort of help and guide", "were they people you\u2019d had contact with before", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "they were all people who had somehow been in my orbit", "and then, i thought, well, let\u2019s just try to make this formal, in some way", "and let\u2019s just see if they would agree to do this", "and they all said yeah, so long as you do that to me in return, which was a very nice, flattering thing", "i\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t work that way", "but that\u2019s been very useful", "and believe me, i did end up using that board when i went through the ceo search", "so, 150 days ago, our founder who had been running conservation international for 30 years stepped down", "and i became the ceo", "and last year, the board went through a very challenging process of trying to decide who the next ceo and what the next leadership team would look like", "and it\u2019s a very scary moment for an organization because over half to the ceo\u2019s who come in after a founder fail", "and, actually, if you want to get the job, you want to be the one in waiting", "seriously, that\u2019s what typically happens", "new ceo comes in, they fail, and either the old ceo comes back, or the person in waiting kind of gets the role and then, runs it", "so, it\u2019s fraught with challenges and dangers all over the place", "and i really didn\u2019t think i would get it", "i thought there was a chance i would get it", "but i was really worried about it for lots of reasons, including my color, to be absolutely honest", "and this mentoring group, honest to god, coached me", "them and a couple of other people really helped coach me through this", "can you share any of the advice that they gave you", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "one really simple one", "so, this is such an amazing thing, and i\u2019ve applied for other jobs before like kind of like the ceo or top level person job and not got that", "three times, in the past, i\u2019ve been rejected for that", "i\u2019d get very close and then, somehow, either they talked me out of it, or i get rejected", "here\u2019s what i was doing", "so, they would ask me, tell me about this", "so, why do you want this job", "and i\u2019m like well, i\u2019ve got a good career", "i don\u2019t really need this, but if it was the right thing", "you kind of had this kind of long, meandering story about saying i\u2019m not totally vested", "yeah, i could do this, but i could do lots of other things", "and i actually feel that way, in a lot of ways", "so, in a lot of ways, i think i\u2019m definitely \u2013 i didn\u2019t start my life thinking i want to be the ceo of conservation international", "it was never a dream", "it was never a goal, never a goal", "the goal was to have impact", "i didn\u2019t really care how i had impact", "but what these guys said to me was like one guy actually said this to me", "he said that is not the right answer", "i want you to repeat after me", "say i will walk through a wall to get this job", "say it", "i\u2019m like really", "say it", "he says, \u201cnow, when you go into that interview, they\u2019re going to ask you this question", "and i want you to repeat this.\u201d so, he did, first question", "why do you want this job", "tell us what prepared you for this job", "and i said, \u201clet me make one thing clear", "i will walk through a wall to get this job.\u201d and they all went, great", "because, guess what", "most times, when you\u2019re hiring people, and i do this all of the time, i hire people all of the time", "and i\u2019m so amazed that i didn\u2019t listen to my own rule", "you want someone who gives you the confidence that they will solve the problems that you don\u2019t want to deal with", "you want someone coming in saying i got this", "you don\u2019t want someone to come in and say i don\u2019t know if i really want it", "convince me", "and you start negotiating at day 1", "you don\u2019t want to do that", "it\u2019s a very, very, simple rule", "so, whatever job you go for, start by saying let me be clear, i really want this job", "i will walk through a wall to get this job", "now, let me tell you what makes me so great for this, and then, just lay it out", "you can negotiate later", "it\u2019s a really simple one", "when you sent the emails out to recruit this x men team of mentors to form a structure, a couple of questions, and this won\u2019t go on for hours", "don\u2019t worry, guys", "even though it could, and it might later with tequila", "i don\u2019t know why i keep thinking of tequila", "we can psychoanalyze that later", "do you interact with these mentors as a group", "or is it all one to one", "m", "sanjayan: it\u2019s one on one, although they know about each other", "getting them together as a group would be too difficult", "impossible, yeah", "do you block out say a week every quarter just to schedule them in batches", "m", "sanjayan: yeah", "i schedule it around travel that i have in their city", "so, i do this as much as i can i person, unless i have a crisis or an emergency, and i just need to get on the phone", "and then, they\u2019re always willing", "i, literally, today, i had a little, minor crisis", "i, literally, had a ceo of a company i don\u2019t want to name, but enormous company, he returned my call today", "i\u2019m so floored", "it\u2019s like i\u2019m so sorry it took me so long to get back to you", "and i\u2019m like you\u2019re kidding me", "once you get that relationship with those few individuals, it does work", "it can really work very well", "did you say, hey, let\u2019s grab coffee and then, make the pitch in person", "or did you lay it out in email", "m", "sanjayan: i made it \u2013 no, i don\u2019t think i did it by email", "i think i did it all by phone or when i met them in person after the first coffee", "so, the people i knew well, i did by phone", "i\u2019ll tell you one thing though", "i do take it sort of seriously", "so, when i go to see them, there are two things that i never make informal, two things that i never make informal", "one is when i talk to my board, my organization board, or my group of mentors\u2019 board, which means i put on a shirt", "i kind of put on a jacket, if it\u2019s appropriate", "whatever way you want to do it, and it\u2019s not about dress code", "but i\u2019m whatever way you want to do it, you want to make sure that they understand that you are using and taking their hour really seriously", "so, just don\u2019t waste time with that", "and the other thing i do, i always take seriously, when i ask people for money, something that i never do on the \u2013 i never ask someone for a donation or to fund conservation international when i\u2019m having a drink with them, or when i\u2019m fly fishing with them or going on a hike with them because people don\u2019t want to be hit up all of the time", "you want to just go do that and enjoy it and have fun", "and then, you want to say can i meet with you at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon, or can i meet with you at 8:00 a.m", "tomorrow or today or whatever it is", "i want to just clean up, show up, and be straight about it", "i said last two questions like twenty questions ago", "but when you\u2019re preparing for one of these meetings, what does it look like", "you have 60 minutes with such and such super hot shot, what\u2019s the format of the hour", "m", "sanjayan: it often depends", "at this point, it depends on what the major thing that i\u2019m dealing with has been and what\u2019s been kind of bugging me on my mind that i really want", "could you give an example, or is it too personal", "m", "sanjayan: it\u2019s not a big surprise", "any time a founder leaves an organization, there are \u2013 so, here\u2019s a really legitimate answer", "so, i was not the only internal candidate going for this job", "there were two other very, very good candidates for this job as well", "and they both could do this job", "they both could be
