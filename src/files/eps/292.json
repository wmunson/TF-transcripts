This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show where each episode it is my job to tease out the habits, routines, belief systems, decision making frameworks, whatever it might be. Backstories, failures, and what they\u2019ve learned from them, that you can borrow from performers and apply in your own lives in some fashion. In this episode, we\u2019re gonna feature three guests: Soman Chainani, Susan Cain, and Graham Duncan. And I won\u2019t get into their bios right now. Soman Chainani was introduced to me by Brian Koppelman, some of you may know, as the cocreator of the hit show Billions as well as a filmmaker, writer, director, known for flicks such as Rounders, The Illusionist\u00b8 and the list goes on and on. Susan Cain, speaking myself as someone who considers himself an introvert who can, for short periods, pretend to be an extrovert. What she writes about is very, very applicable to my own life. And Graham Duncan is a very understated person who tends to stay out of the public eye and out of the limelight. You may notice, for those of you who spotted the names (all three of them are featured in my latest book, Tribe of Mentors), that Graham Duncan has no social media profiles in the book. And that tells you a lot about Graham. All three of them, I should note, share something in common. And that is that I would view all three as people who are very, very expert at mitigating risk. So, I don\u2019t view them as a \u201cthrow caution to the wind, risk it all\u201d bunch whatsoever. Nonetheless, they\u2019ve been very good at capping the downside and making various career decisions and bets that have paid off very, very, very, very large. So, I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. And I will let these three brilliant guests take it from here. Our guest today is Soman Chainani. On Twitter @SomanChainani S-O-M-A-N C-H-A-I-N-A-N-I. On Instagram @SomanC or you can find more about him at SomanChainani.net. Soman is a detailed planner, filmmaker, and New York Times bestselling author. His debut fiction series, The School for Good and Evil has sold more than a million copies, has been translated into more than 20 languages across six continents, and will soon be a film from Universal Pictures. A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia University\u2019s MFA film program, Soman began his career as a screenwriter and director with his films playing at more than 150 film festivals around the world. He was recently named to the OUT100 and has and has received the $100,000.00 Shasha Grant and Sun Valley Writers\u2019 fellowship both for debut writers. Soman Chainani: So, the right book can slip right inside of you and somehow wake up the part of you that\u2019s asleep. It can actually put words to the thoughts that your soul can\u2019t quite get a hold of without at least a little help. And there\u2019re so many books that have done this for me, but there\u2019s three in particular that I\u2019ve read over and over and over. The first is The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, which is this slim, tiny, little book about the creative process. It\u2019s almost like a Tao Te Ching for artists that every time you read, lets you go deeper and deeper into this idea of overcoming the innate resistance that faces anybody who wants to make a change in their life, especially a creative one. And every time I read it, it lights this crazy bonfire inside of me that reminds me just how far I have to go in order to trust the creative voices inside of me instead of the ego voices because that\u2019s the real crisis with all creative work is that it requires us to trust the silent voices, the ones that we actually don\u2019t hear as loud as the positive and negative ones that are always judging the work that we do. And it\u2019s easy to mix all these voices up and end up quietly abandoning your ambition often before you even start your project. These ego voices are also why I became a pharmaceutical consultant at 21 years old, hocking Viagra instead of writing fantasy books and movies like I do now because at the time, a pharmaceutical consultant felt like a safe job, the kind of normal job that you tell your parents about, and they tell their friends about and makes you feel like you\u2019re doing something right with your life. And so, these ego voices are also why I\u2019m afraid to date ivy leaguers, I guess, even though I reluctantly have to admit that I am one because when you go to an ivy league school, you\u2019re tagged as a success before you even accomplish anything, before you even know who you are. And so, it stokes this very fragile sense of self and it makes you play it completely safe. And ultimately, to make any real progress in my own life, I had to decondition myself from my own education and really believe that I had nothing to lose. So, yes. Pressfield\u2019s War of Art. That\u2019s where I would say the yellow brick road starts. For a second book, I\u2019d choose something unusual, which is A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara, which is a whopper of a novel that tracks the friendship of four male friends in New York City over the course of almost 40 years. You honestly won\u2019t find a book more polarizing or divisive, but to me it\u2019s the greatest work of fiction I\u2019ve ever read primarily because it hits a nerve that I\u2019ve struggled with my whole life, which is that all of us have baggage and wounds and pain that have shaped the way we see the world, but we so often hide it or compartmentalize it. And because of that, we close off parts of ourselves and make our lives a lot smaller. A Little Life reminds us that the pain we feel is shared, and it\u2019s a common human bond, we shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of it, and that if we talk about it and shine a light on it, it\u2019s the first step to becoming a whole person instead of a fragmented one. I honestly can\u2019t imagine a more ambitious or healing or moving book, but what\u2019s also funny is that a lot of people hate A Little Life and consider it the worst book ever written. By brother despises it, and he says, \u201cIt\u2019s trash. Basically the literary equivalent of rubbernecking at a car accident.\u201d So, take that for what you will. Tim, if any of your listeners end up reading A Little Life, I\u2019d be curious to hear which camp they end up in. And then, I was thinking for the third book, given my profession, it made sense to think a little younger because I honestly think the greatest exercise you can do when you\u2019re stuck or in a rut in your life is to remember what your favorite children\u2019s book was, a book that you read over and over and over again and never got tired of because somewhere in that book is the clue to not only what makes you tick, but also to your life\u2019s purpose. My book was Peter Pan, which featured a title character who was at once charming and also a complete narcissistic pathological demon. And I think it was that ambiguous space between good and evil that I sparked to as a kid, and I\u2019m now exploring for a living as a result. Tim Ferriss: What purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months or in recent memory? Soman Chainani: This is easy. It\u2019s called Mother Dirt. It clears your skin, and it cost $49.00. My skin was a hot mess for most of my adolescence and into my 20\u2019s. And when skin problems follow you into adulthood, it\u2019s so frustrating because it becomes completely demoralizing, and it psychs you out, and it wreaks havoc on your self-esteem. And in my case, I tried to fix it with will power, which meant that I tried every single product on Earth. I tried antibiotics which kill your stomach. I tried harsh cleansers which dry out your skin and really make everything so much worse. And then I was trying every three-step cleansing program this side of Sephora, which just left my skin even more inflamed and rung out. But then four years ago, I discovered Mother Dirt in a New York Times profile. Back then, I think it was known as AO+ Biome. And their theory was super simple. It was that skin naturally needs AOB, which is short for Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria, in order to stay healthy and clear. But soaps, creams, and all the things we use to help our skin end up killing all that natural bacteria. So, if you stop using those products and restore that bacteria naturally, then all of a sudden, your skin goes back to its normal, healthy state. So, my brain instantly connected with this. I was like, \u201cYes. This makes sense. I want to try this.\u201d So, I wrote them, begging them to become one of their beta testers. And luckily, they agreed. And Mother Dirt came in a little spray bottle which I kept in my fridge. And within a week of using it, my skin was really completely clear. And I\u2019ve been using it for four years every single day. The trick to making it work though is not to use other products that will kill the bacteria while you\u2019re using Mother Dirt. Mother Dirt literally becomes your routine. So, I threw out all my fancy zit zapping, pore unclogging, oil unchiming microderming, \u201cWe promise this will make you look like Natalie Portman,\u201d creams and toners and cleansers. All of it. And it was really the best day ever. And all I do now is spray my face twice a day with Mother Dirt. I don\u2019t use anything else. It\u2019s that easy. Their website is motherdirt.com. And I have tons of experience with this product. So, your listeners should feel free to shoot me questions if they have any of them if they wanna try it or if they\u2019re using it. Tim Ferriss: How has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success? Do you have any favorite failure of yours? Soman Chainani: This story hurts to tell. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever told it. The biggest failure I\u2019ve ever had was with my thesis film at Columbia\u2019s graduate film school. It was a movie I poured all my savings into at that point, about $25,000.00, and worked on for eight months. And a day before my final showing to the faculty, I suddenly got a really bad case of cold feet. And there was a reason for this, which goes back to what I said earlier about ivy leaguers and fragile egos. Columbia Film School had this diabolical little system, which I don\u2019t even know if they still have today. But after the first year, the faculty all got together and gave out this one big cash prize. I think it was $16,000.00 to whoever they thought was the most promising director. I ended up getting that prize, which ended up being a lot more of a curse than anything, since it directly led to the failure that happened next. So, with my thesis film, I wanted to prove so badly that I deserved that prize, that I was the most promising director, that they put their faith in the right student. So, the night before my jury showing, instead of being content with all the work I put into that film, I completely panicked and decided I should show it to one of the professors on the jury hoping that he\u2019d reassure me. He didn\u2019t. He thought it was slow and \u201cfeckless.\u201d That word still stings anytime I hear it or read it. And he recommended I slash the whole movie to pieces and make it half the length. Instead of looking for a second opinion or balancing his feedback against my own thoughts of my work, I panicked liked I was a headless rooster. This professor was obviously on the jury, and I wanted to stay the faculty\u2019s blessed son, and so I trusted external validation at this point in my life more than my own creative compass. So, like a lemming, I followed his advice. I spent the whole night undoing eight months\u2019 work and recutting the film. And the next day, I presented this hacked up Frankenstein to the faculty, who absolutely demolished it. They literally thought it was the worst movie in our class, probably one of the worst movies they\u2019d seen come into the thesis presentations. All credibility I\u2019d earned over the past three years went up in smoke. I wasn\u2019t invited to participate in the public film school festival. Lots of gossip about how I never should have gotten that scholarship floated around, how I had no talent, how I\u2019d let the prize get to my head. And of course it did, just not in the way that they all thought. A few weeks later, I ran into one of those disappointed faculty members, one who\u2019d been a huge supporter of my work before this and now could barely look at me. I told him the story of the last minute recutting I\u2019d done the night before my presentation, and he asked me if he could see the original version. So, I showed it to him. And I just remember the way his eyes lit up like stars. And he said, \u201cAh. There you are. Now I see you.\u201d Incidentally, that short film in its original version went on to great success. And it started my whole career. But here\u2019s the lesson that I remind myself of constantly, and which I hope you can take away from it, which is: Don\u2019t let someone knock you off your course after you\u2019ve put in all the work. You have to trust the work. You have to always trust the work. Tim Ferriss: If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say and why? Soman Chainani: If I was in Hollywood, the billboard would say, \u201cThey\u2019re lying.\u201d And I actually have to remind myself of this all the time. Every time I\u2019m on a call with a Hollywood producer or studio executive, I actually pull up a screensaver with those two words, \u201cTHEY\u2019RE LYING,\u201d in all caps. And I watch it spread across the screen during the call over and over. And it makes the whole experience a lot more productive and less frustrating. This reminds me of my first experience in Hollywood. I was coming out of film school. I\u2019d written a script that a lot of producers and studios were interested in. And at my first ever studio meeting, the exec sweeps into the room, crows it\u2019s the best script that he\u2019s ever read. And he\u2019s like, \u201cKid, we are making this movie.\u201d And he slams his fists on the table. After that meeting, I never heard from him again. And obviously, he didn\u2019t make the movie. But I think it\u2019s a depressing billboard to focus on Hollywood\u2019s lies. So, let\u2019s pick another one. If I\u2019m anywhere but LA, the billboard would say, \u201cIf you can conceive of it, it\u2019s probably wrong.\u201d And use of meditation taught me that most of the ideas, and opinions, and rules, and fixed systems I have in my mind aren\u2019t the real truth. They\u2019re the residues of past experience that I haven\u2019t found a way to let go of. And to be open to life, to be truly ourselves, it\u2019s our job to be aware, only aware, not to clutter that precious awareness with judgements. So, I need meditation as my primary weapon to survive life, to let me study my own brain like a detective looking for thoughts or thought patterns that I can let go of because the secret to happiness, I\u2019ve learned isn\u2019t really happiness at all, but cultivating silence inside of me. This big, blank, beautiful space. And the only way I know how to make more blank space is through meditation. So, 20 minutes a day every day, wherever I am. Often, I use the Headspace app because it logs your progress. So, it gives you a little bit of an incentive to keep a streak going. But all you need is a comfortable chair and silence, and meditation becomes the portal to the rest of my day. Tim Ferriss: What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made? Soman Chainani: Oh, it\u2019s definitely flying trapeze lessons. Those are like shock therapy for the soul because as soon as you get on the platform for your first class, it\u2019s 50 feet high. And so, you\u2019re instantly making all these cerebral calculations. You\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna jump this way, and then I\u2019m gonna do this. And then my legs are gonna go over the bar here, and I\u2019m gonna drop into the net there.\u201d And it\u2019s all complete and utter BS because once you jump off the platform; you realize in an instant that you have two choices. Either you trust your body, or you die. And for someone who makes a living with my head, I need that kind of primal therapy to reintegrate with my body in a very forceful, violent way. And just one class made me realize that underneath my mind\u2019s chatter, my body actually has everything under control if I\u2019m willing to just take the plunge and fly. This reminds me of a related story which is that I\u2019m a compulsive CrossFitter. And at first, my favorite skill when I started the classes was box jumps. It felt so controllable that if you just jump on a box of a certain height, and you clear it, you get to build the box higher and try again. It was linear, it was Pavlovian, and it rewards a control freak like me in the clearest possible way. But at some point I hit a plateau, and I couldn\u2019t jump any higher. I got frustrated. I tried to will myself higher. I was watching YouTube videos all day trying to find out what I was doing wrong. And it just led to me forcing it again, and again, and again, and compromising my form and wiping out a lot. And no matter how much I grit my teeth and did it again and again, I couldn\u2019t get past my max of 42 inches. So, I finally said, \u201cThat\u2019s my max.\u201d I told my trainer, Dave. I said, \u201c42 inches. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s my complete max.\u201d And he disagreed. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten to this height by jumping. Anyone can jump. You can control a jump. But the only way you\u2019re going to get any higher is by flying. And you can\u2019t think your way through flight.\u201d So, I had to relearn box jumping to get past my self-imposed max, my cerebral max, and find my real maximum. And this required the same trust in my body as the trapeze did. Jump, commit, let the body do the work. And if there\u2019s one thing you can take from this, it\u2019s that you can find something in your own life that forces you to have this experience. Jump, commit, let the body do the work. whether those trapeze lessons, or an improv class, or just freestyle dancing in your room to Rhianna, let your body show you its natural intelligence. Give it the chance to show you. It\u2019s gonna be the most intimate experience you ever have with yourself. Tim Ferriss: What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? Soman Chainani: I feel like this is a guilty pleasures question. And I have so many of those. Everything from Celine Dion to peanut butter slathered popcorn to the movie Showgirls to that horrible TV show ALF. But here\u2019s one I guess that\u2019s more important to me. It\u2019s not something I confess regularly. But every night before I go to bed, I pull out old issues of Archie comics and read them. It\u2019s not a new habit. I used to read Archie as a kid before I went to bed back then, also. And it\u2019s because Riverdale in the comic always seems so crisp and bright and welcoming. Riverdale was the complete opposite of the kind of school I went to, which always felt so dark and morose and always made me feel scared somehow before having to go there on Monday mornings. And so, just reading the Archie comics gave me a little soothing warm feeling before I drifted off to sleep that I still get to this very day when I read them. But maybe more importantly, closing the day by reading the same thing I did when I was younger gives my life this sense of perfect order somehow. Maybe there\u2019s a deeper lesson in this, also. I know I\u2019m technically a writer of young adult literature, but I never think of my audience that way. Or I never think of myself as a writer for kids because I think the things we love when we\u2019re young are still the things we love when we\u2019re older. We just forget. Or we give up. Or we \u201cgrow up.\u201d And that\u2019s why the old fairy tales always held so much power for me because they worked for everyone, young or old. It didn\u2019t matter who you were. Just like Archie works for me young or old. And so, maybe we all grow up in body one day, but I\u2019m not sure our soul ever does. And that\u2019s why the best stories somehow can touch us all and transcend things like age, or nationality, or culture, or anything like that. That\u2019s why the best stories are universal. Tim Ferriss: In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life? Soman Chainani: I know I should offer something deeply profound here, but honestly, the thing that\u2019s most improved my life in the last year is unfollowing hot people on Instagram. There\u2019s this amazing short story by Ted Chiang that started all this called \u201cLiking What You See\u201d that did a real number on me. The story asserts that beauty has become this kind of alien modern day super drug that with filters and Facetune on social media, and retouched models on ads, and porn so easily accessible, we\u2019ve completely overloaded the senses and overstimulated ourselves so that our natural instincts can no longer recognize or react to real beauty anymore. And that\u2019s making us confused and miserable both in how we judge ourselves and also how we judge others. And that crystal clear warning that beauty is literally ruining our lives like the worst drug woke me up because if we\u2019re not careful, and this is where I fell into this trap and was completely guilty of it, our social media feeds become filled with people we follow only because they\u2019re beautiful or because we\u2019re envious of their lives. And without really realizing it, your feed turns into this torture device, an assault of beauty and perfection designed to make you feel inadequate. And so, opening up Instagram doesn\u2019t inspire you anymore. It just makes you start to hate-live your own life since you can\u2019t possibly measure up to the gods and goddesses of all these perfectly filtered pictures. And it makes you intolerant of other peoples\u2019 real imperfections. And then it makes you start to despise the weight of real people and real life and invest in shallow, flimsy, 2D mirrors of it. It makes you constantly judge your own life against others. It makes you fragment your own consciousness because you\u2019re living outside of your own life in order to get the perfect picture of it. It\u2019s completely and utterly deadly. And so, I would say you have to use social media to make yourself better, to make yourself feel better, not to punish yourself. And that honestly has been the most valuable change in my life in the last couple years. Tim Ferriss: What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the real world? Soman Chainani: Let\u2019s start with the advice that I\u2019d give, which is make sure that you have something every day that you\u2019re looking forward to. Hopefully, it\u2019s your job. But if it\u2019s not, which is a completely universal and understandable condition, maybe it\u2019s a basketball game after work, or a voice lesson, or your writing group, or an open mic night. Maybe it\u2019s a date. Have something every day that lights you up because it\u2019ll keep your soul hungry to create more of these moments instead of getting dragged down into the rut of having a job that you\u2019re not excited about. And I\u2019ll also remind you what really fulfills you in life. When I was a pharmaceutical consultant, and I was completely miserable, I used to come home from work and work on my novel that would eventually become The School for Good and Evil. I never intended to publish it. I never intended anyone to read it. I just did it to offset the misery of a job that I hated. And over time, I loved writing the book so much that I used to leave early sometimes in order to work on it. And slowly, the novel started to take over my work life too. I found myself secretly working on it in the mornings, during meetings, in the corner during office, during lunch. And eventually, I got fired because they figured out I wasn\u2019t doing any of the real work, and I was actually working on my book. And the truth was I wasn\u2019t upset because I had discovered what had made me happy at that point, which was telling stories. And nothing was gonna put that genie back in the bottle. As for advice I\u2019d ignore, a little part of me dies every time someone tells me that they\u2019ve taken a job as a stepping stone to something else when they clearly have no interest in that job whatsoever. And I think it\u2019s because the truth is you only have one life to live. Time is super valuable. It\u2019s the one currency that we\u2019re all fighting to get more of. And so, if you\u2019re using the idea of stepping stones and jobs that you\u2019re not really interested in to get somewhere else, you\u2019re probably relying on somebody else\u2019s path or definitions of success that was created in the past. And I think it\u2019s more important to live in your own present and try to make your own path. It\u2019s gonna end up being more fulfilling for your own life. Tim Ferriss: What are bad recommendations that you hear in your profession or are of expertise? Soman Chainani: I think too often, aspiring artists put this pressure on themselves to make the creative work their only source of income, that they can\u2019t be an artist unless they\u2019re a fulltime artist somehow. And in my experience, it\u2019s just a road to complete and utter misery because if art is your only source of income, then there\u2019s unrelenting pressure on that art. And mercenary pressure isn\u2019t just the enemy of the creative elves inside you trying to get the work done, but mercenary pressure also often leads to really bad and rushed work. So, having another stream of income drains the pressure on your creative engine. If nothing comes of your art or it flops miserably, whatever. You still have an ironclad plan to support yourself. And so, your creative soul feels a lot lighter. It feels free to do its best work. And I\u2019m still a personal practitioner of this even though I could easily be a fulltime writer because after four books and a movie deal, I want a separate side stream of income in order to be able to write without feeling like it\u2019s a matter of life and death. So, I tutor kids on the side. I help them with their college applications. And I\u2019ve been doing that for the last ten years. And really no plans to stop because it makes the books better in the end if I don\u2019t feel like the books are my only source of livelihood. Tim Ferriss: In the last five years, what have you become better at saying, \u201cNo,\u201d to? Soman Chainani: I\u2019m convinced that the reason Hollywood movies are often so terrible is because everyone is so busy hedging their bets that they\u2019re working on a thousand projects at once. They don\u2019t wanna commit to anything for fear that it\u2019s gonna fail. No one is giving anything their full focus. So, when I worked on The School for Good and Evil, I decided to take the opposite track. I decided to commit completely. And the series has taught me to be patient because when I\u2019m writing a new book, that\u2019s all I work on. And I say, \u201cNo,\u201d to all other creative projects no matter how lucrative. Do I miss opportunities? Absolutely. But it means that when the books hit the shelves, I know that I have left everything on the page, and they\u2019re the absolute best I could have done, which then gives the series the greatest chance to survive through time. It\u2019s easier to say, \u201cNo,\u201d though when professionally, I know what my driving need is because if your driving need is to build income and provide for your family, then you\u2019ll say no to anything that doesn\u2019t further that goal. But if your driving need is to have your own business, for example, then you need to be a bit more promiscuous in trying out ideas until the right one hits. In my case, my driving need is always unequivocal, which is I want to make something that lasts. And that means committing to my current work like a marriage and believing that if I give these six books in the series everything I have, then better opportunities will eventually rise to replace the ones that I\u2019ve passed up. Tim Ferriss: When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do? Soman Chainani: So, feeling overwhelmed usually means one of two things. Either my blood\u2019s trapped in my head, and I need to get out there and exercise and move the blood around and give myself space to breathe, or more likely, my to do list has become completely overpacked, and my brain knows there\u2019s no way I can reasonably get done everything I\u2019ve set out to do. And so, that\u2019s been the solution is taking out the calendar and start canceling things, moving things around, seeing what I can take off my plate. And then, I can feel the paralysis evaporate once I\u2019ve hit that threshold of knowing that I can reasonably accomplish whatever I want to do now. Feeling unfocused is a little different because it usually means I haven\u2019t quite locked in to whatever I\u2019m working on, that a part of me still thinks I can ripcord and bail and is afraid to commit. It usually happens in the first three months of writing a new book because that lack of focus is usually just fear. Fear that the new book is terrible, fear that it\u2019s going to fail miserably and sink my career. Early on, I used to give in to that fear. And four books later now, I know that I just have to hold on tight, grit my teeth, and blow right through it like a ghost. Tim Ferriss: Our guest today is Susan Cain. C-A-I-N. On Twitter @SusanCain. Facebook: Author Susan Cain. Quietrev.com is her website. Susan is the cofounder of quiet revolution and the author of the bestsellers Quiet Power subtitle: The secret strengths of introverted kids and Quiet subtitle: The power of introverts in a world that can\u2019t stop talking, which has been translated into 40 languages and has been on the New York Times bestseller list for more than four years straight. Quiet was named the best book of the year by Fast Company Magazine, which also named Susan one of its most creative people in business. Susan is the cofounder of the Quiet Schools Network and the Quiet Leadership Institute. And her writing has appeared in the New York Times, the Atlantic, the Wall Street Journal, and other publications. Her TED Talk has been viewed more than 17 million times, probably more than 20 million at this point, and was named by Bill Gates as one of his all-time favorite talks. How has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success? Do you have any favorite failure of yours? Susan Cain: So, a very long time ago, I used to be a corporate lawyer. And I was a very ambivalent corporate lawyer. And anyone could have told you that I was in the wrong profession. But still, I had dedicated tons of time to it: three years of law school, one year of clerking for a federal judge, six and a half years at a Wall Street law firm, and I had a lot of very deep relationships with fellow attorneys. But the day came when I was very well along on partnership track, that the senior partner in my firm came to my office and sat down and told me that I would not be put up for partner on schedule. And to this day, I really don\u2019t know whether he met that I would never be put up for partner or just delayed for a long time. But all I know is that I burst into tears right in front of him and then asked for a leave of absence. And I left work that day, and I remember bicycling around and around Central Park in New York City having no idea what I was gonna do next. I thought I\u2019d probably travel. And I had all kinds of plans to go to India and so on. But instead, and this all happened in such a sudden and cinematic way that it will defy belief, but what happened is I remembered that I had always wanted to be a writer, which seems strange. You would think I had always had that in the back of my mind, but my writing dreams were something I had forgotten about for a very long time. But I started writing that very night. And then the next day, I signed up for a class at NYU in creative nonfiction writing. And the next week, I went to the very first session of that class, and it really was like an epiphany moment. I felt like I was finally home. I had no expectation of ever making a living through writing because you always hear about how difficult that is, but it was clear to me that from then on, I was gonna put writing at my center. And so, I decided to just look for freelance work that would give me lots of free time to feed my hobby. Now, if I had succeeded at making partner on schedule, I might still be there today, miserably negotiating corporate transactions 16 hours a day. It\u2019s not that I had never thought about what else I might want to do other than law, but there\u2019s something about being inside a very intense, 16-hour-a-day, hermetic culture like a law practice that makes it really difficult to figure out what else you might wanna do. Tim Ferriss: What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made? Susan Cain: The best investment I ever made was the seven years of time that it took me to write Quiet. I really didn\u2019t care how long it took. And though I very much wanted the book to succeed, I felt good about that investment of time regardless of the outcome because I really didn\u2019t know what was gonna happen. But I felt so certain that writing in general and that writing that book in particular was the right thing to do. First of all, I had two kids along the way. So, of course that slowed me down. But also, I handed in a first draft after the first two years, and my editor basically said, \u201cThis is very crappy.\u201d And she said, \u201cTake all the time you need and start from scratch and go home and get it right.\u201d And you might think that that was a moment of grand discouragement, but it was actually exactly the opposite. I remember leaving her office elated because I agreed with her. And I knew I needed a lot of time to get it right. And I was thrilled that the publisher was giving it to me. I had never published a word before Quiet, and I felt like I was learning how to write a book from scratch. And most publishing houses rush books to market a long time before they\u2019re really, fully done just because of economic exigencies. And I feel like if she had done that, there would be no Quiet Revolution. Tim Ferriss: What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? Susan Cain: I really love sad, minor key music. And the funny thing is I find that kind of music very elevating and transcendent and not actually sad at all. And I think it\u2019s because this kind of music is really about the fragility and the preciousness of life and love. So, if you\u2019re curious about some examples, for me Leonard Cohen is my patron saint. You could try listening to \u201cDance Me to the End of Love,\u201d or to \u201cFamous Blue Raincoat,\u201d or pretty much to anything that he\u2019s ever written. If you\u2019re not familiar with his work, I\u2019m sure you know his song, \u201cHallelujah\u201d that has been made into a cover a gazillion times. But that really is only the tip of the Leonard iceberg. I also love this song called \u201cHinach Yafah\u201d by an amazing guy named Idan Raichel. It\u2019s a really gorgeous song of a man longing for his beloved, and it\u2019s really about longing in general, whether longing for God, or for heaven, or whatever. My favorite word in any language is the word saudade, which is the Portuguese word that\u2019s at the heart of Brazilian and Portuguese culture and music. And it basically means a kind of sweet longing for a beloved thing or person that will likely never return to you. And I know that sounds so desperately sad, but again, it\u2019s so hard to articulate it, but there\u2019s something so incredibly beautiful and transcendent in that very idea. And if you wanna hear music expressing that idea, you could try a band called Madredeus or the singer Ces\u00e1ria. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m pronouncing her name correctly, but Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora. Something like that. And by the way, my next book, or my whole next work chapter of my life is all about this topic of how loss and longing are such an essential part of love, and art, and growth in general. Tim Ferriss: What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the real world? Susan Cain:\u00a0\u00a0 Smart, driven college student. You\u2019re gonna hear so many stories of people who risked everything in order to achieve this goal or that goal, especially when it comes to creative goals. But I don\u2019t believe that your best creative work is done when you\u2019re stressed out because you\u2019re on the edge of bankruptcy or some other personal disaster. It\u2019s really just the opposite. So, you should be setting up your life in a way that\u2019s as comfortable and as happy as possible, and that often means setting it up in a way that doesn\u2019t appear very creative on the outside because you\u2019re tapping in to more conservative structures, but what you\u2019re really doing is freeing yourself up to accommodate your creative work. So, I often ask myself whether all those years of Wall Street law were a waste, given that what I really was meant, I think, to be doing the whole time was to explore human psychology and do what I love to do now, writing about what it\u2019s like to be alive. It\u2019s really how I think of my work. But the answer is that no. It was totally not a waste for so many reasons, first of all because I learned so much about this so called real world that would have otherwise been a mystery to me, and second because a front row seat at a wall street negotiation is as good a place as any to study the ridiculousness of being human, but most of all, maybe, is because those years that I spent practicing law gave me a financial cushion when I was ready to use it to try out a creative life. It wasn\u2019t a huge cushion. I had not managed to save that much. But it did make a huge difference. So, even once I started my writing life, I spent tons of time setting up this little freelance business on the side where I taught people negotiation skills. And it was something that I felt I could use as long as I needed to support myself when my real center always was writing. The thing I was trying to do the whole time was take the pressure off the writing, so that the writing could always be a source of joy and satisfaction. So, I told myself that my goal was to get something published by the time I was 75 years old. And that was it. So, I met my goal a lot earlier than that. So, I am not saying, by the way, that the smart, driven college student who wants to have a creative life should spend ten years in corporate finance first. I\u2019m very much not saying that. I\u2019m really making a more basic point that you should just be planning how you\u2019re gonna make ends meet and have a way to do that. And that way, the time that you do spend on your creative projects, and it could be 30 minutes a day, it could be ten hours a day, but you want those moments to be about focus, and flow, and occasional glimpses of joy. You do not want them to be associated with financial stress. Tim Ferriss: When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do? Susan Cain:\u00a0\u00a0 I love espresso, and I would happily consume it all day long, but I\u2019m really afraid of habituating to it and losing its magic powers. So, I only allow myself to have one latte a day. And I save it for when I\u2019m doing my most creative work of the day because it really does jumpstart my mind in this almost magical \u2013 it has a kind of magical power. And also, by now, I associate latte in a kind of Pavlovian way with writing, which then gets associated in a Pavlovian way with the pleasure of coffee. So, it\u2019s all a really good feedback loop. Tim Ferriss: My guest today is Graham Duncan. You can find out more about him at eastrockcap \u2013 C-A-P \u2013 .com. Graham is the cofounder of East Rock Capital, an investment firm that manages $2 billion or so for a small number of families and their charitable foundations. Before starting East Rock 12 years ago, Graham worked at two other investment firms. He started his career by cofounding the independent Wall Street research firm, Medley Global Advisors. Graham graduated from Yale with a B.A. in ethics, politics, and economics. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and serves as co-chair of the Sohn Conference Foundation, which funds pediatric cancer research. Our mutual friend Josh Waitzkin, who introduced us \u2013 and you should look up Josh Waitzkin if you don\u2019t know who he is. I\u2019ll give you a hint: Searching for Bobby Fischer. Josh calls Graham, \u201cThe tip of the spear in the realms of talent tracking in judgment of human potential in high-stakes mental arenas.\u201d That is a mouthful, but Graham, as I\u2019ve gotten to know him over the years, is more and more impressive with every encounter that I have with him. And if you wanna hear more from Graham (ideas, his thinking, frameworks, everything), you can sign up for his monthly email newsletter at GrahamDuncan.blog. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? Graham Duncan: So Tim, I wear the SUBPAC Wearable Physical Sound System while I commute on the subway to my office. And sometimes I wear it while I work at my desk. You strap the system to your back and chest, and it lets you feel the vibration of music through your whole body. Music producers, gamers, and deaf people are the primary users. I find the full body experience of music makes listening to music, or even a podcast that has a lot of bass, more of an immersive somatic experience rather than just a conceptual head thing. Tim Ferriss: If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say and why? Graham Duncan: So, I have two candidates. First, \u201cIt\u2019s not how well you play the game. It\u2019s deciding what game you wanna play.\u201d That\u2019s by Kwame Appiah who\u2019s a philosophy professor at NYU. And I like it because it separates striving from strategy, and it reminds me to take a macro view of whatever I\u2019m doing, like in a video game where you can zoom out, and you suddenly see you\u2019ve been running around in one corner of the maze. It loosens my relationship to the game too. It\u2019s the game of the game, helping to separate having ambition from being ambitious, or accessing hustle without actually becoming a hustler. Another quote that I really like is form the Buddhist novelist George Saunders, who said in an interview with the New Yorker that he has an image of people\u2019s \u201cnectar in decaying containers.\u201d Buddhists like Saunders think everyone has a Buddha nature, that good core of your being. Some people sometimes lose track of it, but it\u2019s there. And I think it\u2019s such a good assumption to have about everyone even if you\u2019re wrong sometimes, that that\u2019s there. And I also love that image of \u201cnectar in decaying containers.\u201d It helps me visualize the stream of Buddha nature flowing through all the lovely, flawed, living, and slowly dying creatures that we all encounter every day. And I sometimes get this glimpse of how my three-year-old daughter\u2019s three-year-old self is so temporary. Buddhists like to say we\u2019re all on fire, and it\u2019s so beautiful to sometime tune in and just see the flickering. What are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life? So, the psychiatrist Sam Barondes has a book called Making Sense of People that\u2019s had a huge impact on my thinking. And I sometimes give a copy to people who are building a new team and doing a lot of hiring, or even a friend that might be deciding whether or not to get engaged. As part of my role as an investor, I interview four to five hundred people a year to decide whether to hire them or invest in their various startups or investment funds. The most useful mental model I\u2019ve found to help me understand what makes people tick is the one that Barondes describes eloquently in his book. The model is called the \u201cBig Five,\u201d or OCEAN. And the O stands for open-minded. The C stands for conscientious. The E for extroverted. A for agreeable. N for neurotic. And the academics who developed the model clumped every English adjective that could be used to describe somebody into categories, and then they reduced them to as small a set of factors as they could. So, if lots of people agreed they could call somebody both gregarious and outgoing, then they decided that was the same thing. And they kept reducing that down until they got, say, extroversion as a primary factor. And in the academic literature on personality, the Big Five is like the equivalent of gravity. There have been thousands of studies, and it\u2019s considered much more statistically accurate than alternatives such as Myers-Briggs. And so, if you want to picture it like for high open-minded, picture Leonardo da Vinci. For high conscientious picture Robocop. For high extroverted, picture Bill Clinton. And for the opposite, high introverted, picture Obama. For low neuroticism, picture The Dude from the Big Lebowski or any stereotypical Californian. And for high neuroticism, picture Woody Allen, or Kanye West, or most New Yorkers. I could free associate about the Big Five, but I\u2019ll leave it there. If you want more then check out Sam Barondes book, and Scott Barry Kaufman is also obsessed with the Big Five and writes a bunch of useful stuff about it. There are two other mental models that have greatly influenced my thinking about people and teams.\u00a0 The first is Harvard Professor Robert Kegan\u2019s model of adult development. Kegan argues that adults develop and make sense of reality in five discreet phases. He lays out his theory in his 1994 book In Over Our Heads, which is unfortunately not available on Kindle, but is available in paperback. And the title In Over Our Heads is a reference to how the vast majority of adult Americans are at the \u201csocialized\u201d stage of development. He calls it level three. They have difficulty taking other people\u2019s perspectives, and they tend to follow assumptions given to them by society (as opposed to assumptions they freely choose). And he puts out in modern life that many activities such as parenting benefit if you can set boundaries and not care what your kid thinks. You need to direct them in doing what you think they should do. I feel like I sometimes see what I imagine to be socialized stage parents who are almost of their kid on some level. They take what their kids think too seriously, and they wanna be their friends first and parents second. When I\u2019m interviewing somebody, there\u2019s something that can feel a little bit icy when you\u2019re interacting with self-authored people because they aren\u2019t sourcing their approval from you. There\u2019s something about the tone of the interview that is distinctive. And to try to make this more concrete, there\u2019s this amazing example in Chapter 9 of In Over Our Heads, where Kegan describes a couple who are both operating from a self-authored mindset. And it\u2019s a very distinctive description of the way they make sense of each other and of being married that totally reminds me of one of Tim\u2019s podcasts with Laird Hamilton and Gabby Reece where Gabby is describing the way she relates to Laird and to their marriage in a way that, to my ear, is a super unusual, self-authored way. For people who are interested in learning more about the model, I recommend Kegan\u2019s later book, Immunity to Change where he describes the model briefly at the beginning of the book. I\u2019ll read a quick excerpt, just so people have a feel. \u201cHaving a socialized mind dramatically influences the sending and receiving of information at work. If this is the level of mental complexity through which I view the world, then what I send will be strongly influenced by what I believe others want to hear. Let\u2019s contrast this with the self-authoring mind. If I view the world from this level of mental complexity, what I send is more likely to be a function of what I deem others need to hear to best further the agenda or mission of my design. Consciously or unconsciously, I have a direction, an agenda, a stance, a strategy, an analysis of what is needed, a prior context from which my communication arises. The self-authoring mind creates a filter for what it will allow to come through. It places a priority on receiving the information it has sought. Information that I haven\u2019t asked for and which does not have obvious relevance to my own design for action has a much tougher time making it through my filter. It\u2019s easy to see how all of this could describe an admirable capacity for focus, for distinguishing the important from the urgent, for making best use of one\u2019s limited time by having a means to cut through the unending and ever mounting claims on one\u2019s attention. This speaks to the way the self-authoring mind is then advanced over the socialized mind. But the same description may also be a recipe for disaster if one\u2019s plan or stance is flawed in some way, if it leaves out some crucial element of the equation not appreciated by the filter, or if the world changes in such a way that a once good frame becomes an antiquated one. In contrast, the self-transforming mind both values and is wary about any one stance analysis or agenda. It is mindful that powerful though a given design might be, this design almost inevitably leaves something out. It is aware that it lives in time, and that the world is in motion, and that what might have made sense today may not make as much sense tomorrow. Therefore, when communicating, people with self-transforming minds are not only advancing their agenda and design, they\u2019re also inquiring about the design itself. Information sending is not just on behalf of driving. It is also to remake the map or reset the direction. If someone wants to hear how a person sounds when they make sense of reality at the self-transforming stage, then I\u2019d direct them to listen to Tim\u2019s early podcast with Ed Catmull, the Pixar founder and president. The loose but strong grip that Catmull has on his own beliefs, his fluid and flexible relationship to time, there\u2019s a slightly ephemeral quality and comfort with paradox that comes through in the interview. In Tim\u2019s interview with him, he\u2019s actually a bit of a difficult interviewee, and he feels a little hard to pin down at times. For instance, he refuses to answer Tim\u2019s question about what he would tell his 20-year-old self because he says now he has a way of understanding that his 20-year-old self simply couldn\u2019t understand. This is all very consistent with a self-transforming mindset, which happens later in life for most people if it happens at all. As an example, it would surprise me to hear Catmull say or think any version of \u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay relevant\u201d as he gets older. And from one perspective, he might be losing ground versus younger people in this industry, or he fails to get his phone calls returned. But his way of making sense is likely that he gets to define who or what is relevant, not his peers in Silicon Valley or the movie industry. One last self-transforming example I would is the voice of the narrator of \u201cThe Parable\u201d by Louise Gluck. If you Google it, she\u2019s really amazing. The third mental model that I find myself recommending lately is not in a book, but on a slightly obscure website called workwithsource.com, and it\u2019s based on a European management consultant who studied hundreds of startups and realized that even when there are multiple cofounders, there\u2019s actually always, in every case he found, an actual single \u201csource\u201d: the person who took the first risk on a new initiative, even if that risk was only picking up the phone and calling the other cofounder. And he argues that that source maintains a unique relationship with what he calls the gestalt of the original idea. And that person has an intuitive knowledge of what the right next step for the initiative is, whereas others who join later to help with the execution often lack that intuitive connection to the founder\u2019s original insight. And these guys argue that many organizational tensions and power struggles actually often revolve around lack of explicit acknowledgement of who the source of the initiative is. I was talking about this with a prominent angel investor recently, and he had found that consistent with his sample of startups. And he noted that many founders seemed to hire friends as cofounders more to quell their own anxiety during the early, highly ambiguous days of a new company than to fulfil a specific role. This can work fine as long as everyone is clear on who the source is. And what\u2019s a little paradoxical here is that the responsibility to fully own the role of source rests in large part with the source themselves. Handing off the source role of an initiative to another person is possible but extremely difficult, and it\u2019s often mishandled. And these guys note that a key to a successful transition is for the original source to actually move on and allow the new leader room to move. I was speaking with an investment manager about this, and it was consistent with a study he\u2019d done of stock performance following founder CEOs departing their businesses. And he found that any subsequent positive stock performance was correlated with the founder completely leaving the board rather than hanging around to mentor the next CEO. So, through that lens, Gates remaining on the Microsoft board during Ballmer\u2019s tenure may have contributed to subsequent lackluster stock performance and Ballmer\u2019s inability to exert his own creative vision, whereas Ballmer leaving the board has allowed Satya Nadella to fully exert his own creative vision. I encounter this dynamic myself sometimes in running a multifamily office where we manage money for Forbes 500 families. And second and third generations sometimes struggle with how to relate to the original patriarch and the \u201csource\u201d or their wealth. In my observation, it\u2019s often that room for real transition is in the hands of the original source. It\u2019s the lesson from George Washington\u2019s song in the Hamilton musical, as Washington declines Hamilton\u2019s plea to run for a third term, and he sings, \u201cWe\u2019re going to teach them how to say goodbye.\u201d Tim Ferriss: What purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months or in recent memory? Graham Duncan: So, I recently bought the FINIS, F-I-N-I-S, swim paddles. They somewhat magically lengthen out my freestyle stroke. And when I combined them with some fins, I use the ones Cressi, C-R-E-S-S-I, I feel sometimes like I\u2019m almost flying through the water. For non-swimmers, I highly recommend the canned sardines from Matiz, M-A-T-I-Z. I feel like one of my proudest accomplishments as a dad is that my two younger kids eat sardines with me most mornings for breakfast. They\u2019re super high protein and high good fats. There\u2019s no need to supplement fish oil. And Matiz sardines aren\u2019t fishy. I usually add avocado with salt and lemon, and the kids love them. And I often alternate the sardines with canned wild salmon belly, which they call restreca, R-E-S-T-R-E-C-A, from the company Vital Choice. The bonus on both of those is that when the zombie apocalypse comes, you\u2019ll have canned food ready to go. Tim Ferriss: How has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success? Do you have any favorite failure of yours? Graham Duncan: I have so many failures. I\u2019m just gonna pick one. In my role in investing in and seeding investment firms, I do really extensive reference checks on people in order to try to accelerate the process of building mutual trust with them. And I should note that I have a somewhat oddly specific aspiration to be among the best in the world in terms of being able to really do a reference on someone. I feel like it\u2019s a real art form to gather private information in the form of multiple perspectives about how someone has played a repeat iteration game in the past and then try to accurately project how they\u2019re gonna play in the future. And I define success as gathering enough honest perspectives on someone to mimic how I would know someone if I had sat next to them at work for five years. At East Rock, we try to do references in person, and it\u2019s a huge time investment. In late 2007, I was about to back a firm, and we conducted a final reference check with the investment manager\u2019s former boss who was quite negative and skeptical about his former analyst. I remember I asked him what percentile the analyst was in terms of all the analysts who had ever worked for him, and he said top 60 percent, which I thought I misheard at first. And I\u2019ve never gotten that response again in a reference. And it surprised me, given that the analyst had given me this guy\u2019s name as a reference. It wasn\u2019t an off-list reference. It was on his list. And it made me pause on proceeding with the investment, which then proceeded to work out amazingly well as the financial crisis unfolded, and I had a lot of regret about the size of the profits I missed. Later on, it emerged that the reference source may have had an agenda to sabotage his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s new firm. Then several years later, I was evaluating another investment manager to partner with, and toward the end of our diligence process, I got another reference not quite as negative as that one, but it was mixed. But I felt like at this point, I was better able to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously without experience cognitive dissonance. It\u2019s like the state of negative capability that Keats referred to as useful to writers. And this time, having those mixed data points only made me do more work, and I gained even more conviction in the character and competence of the investment manager. And that investment has ended up being super profitable. And I think absent my earlier failure, I wouldn\u2019t have had the ability to see the reality of the situation. And it also just helped me appreciate something I try to do, which is I try to hold people\u2019s perspectives with a light grip, which the knowledge that they and I have very incomplete maps of reality. Tim Ferriss: What are bad recommendations that you hear in your profession or area of expertise? Graham Duncan: So, I think people massively overuse the term \u201chedge fund.\u201d They fetishize it a little too much. And it reminds me a little bit of a similar issue that Ray Dalio found when he used the word depression in 2008 to describe some of the underlaying dynamics in the economy. He found that his readers had too much baggage with the word, so he switched to using the word \u201cdeprocess.\u201d And Yuval Harari makes a similar reframing move by referring to us as sapiens because we have so much baggage about being human and being in the center of the most important species. And in a similar way, I think people now have way too much baggage with the word \u201chedge fund.\u201d The press and the managers themselves have made it almost jump the shark. And I\u2019ve been telling people lately, I think we should start using \u201cH structure\u201d or something like that to instead capture the concept of incentive compensation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to see a hedge fund, or a product, or even the hedge fund industry because these are just temporary constructions of flawed, brilliant people, who in any given year decide to make a sequel to the movie they made the prior year. The only product is the set of future decisions that the portfolio manager make. If they get divorced, or depressed, if their second in command leaves, the \u201cproduct\u201d completely changes. And I think thinking of it as a product ignores the reality that the only source of stability is actually whether the mindset of the team leader is resilient or even antifragile, which is Nassim Taleb\u2019s thing about it actually getting stronger with volatility rather than just enduring it. Tim Ferriss: When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do? Graham Duncan: So, I ask myself, \u201cWhat would be the worst thing about that outcome not going the way I want?\u201d I had actually starting using it out loud with my kids, and recently, my eight-year-old daughter started asking it back to me, which was karmic full circle. I really like to be punctual, and we were late to drop her at school. And I was impatiently hurrying her along. And she asked me, \u201cDad, what exactly would be the worst thing about being late?\u201d And in the moment, it completely shifted my mindset. I like the question because it often surfaces a hidden assumption. In this case, maybe some subconscious script of, \u201cI\u2019m playing the role of father, and our family meets our commitments,\u201d or some version of that. And another good related question is Byron Katie\u2019s thing about can the opposite of your story be true? I think that question serves the same role. Tim Ferriss: In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life? Graham Duncan: I\u2019ve begun swimming most mornings, and I find it often shifts my mindset for the entire rest of my day. Some swimmers talk about this concept of \u201cwater feel,\u201d which is getting a grip in the water and pulling your body past that point instead of ripping your hand through the water. Ripping your hand through the water moves you forward, but it\u2019s a lot less efficient, and it\u2019s less graceful. And I really like David Foster Wallace\u2019s speech, \u201cThis Is Water,\u201d where he\u2019s making the point that so much of life is water to us. We\u2019re swimming in it. We can\u2019t see it because we\u2019re either in a hurry or not awake to our context. Or in Kegan language, we are subject to it. And when I stop to really feel the water before I pull, it shifts my way of being from one of thrashing toward the end of the pool somewhat mindlessly to a more effortless flow of working with the reality of the water where I am. Tim Ferriss: What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the real world? Graham Duncan: So lately, I\u2019ve been thinking about careers through Dan Siegel\u2019s model of mental health where he says, \u201cPicture a river flowing between two banks where one side is chaos and the other side is rigidity.\u201d And Dan points out that mental illnesses all reside on one bank or the other. Schizophrenia is on the chaos side. OCD is rigidity. And basically, a healthy integration is swimming in the middle of the river, says the argument. And most college students have started life closer to the rigidity bank is my observation and over the course of their careers will experiment with swimming toward the middle. And I\u2019ve come to think of the lane right next to the rigidity bank as an appropriately conventional one for when you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s and you\u2019re acquiring the skill of refining reality. It\u2019s a place to swim where it\u2019s important to learn the jargon of an industry and apprentice under somebody, to develop judgment and discover your own zone of genius. And I think swimming in the middle lane happens most often in people\u2019s 30\u2019s or 40\u2019s. It\u2019s a stage where you begin crafting your own language for what you do. As an increasingly strong poet, you make your craft your own. You view your life as more self-expression than simply playing out other people\u2019s roles for you. And then some small percentage of people will paddle over to the lane next to chaos, which is the place where you find novelists like Robert Pirsig and David Foster Wallace, investors like Mike Burry or Eddie Lampert, or entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. And I experience them as consistently asserting reality through powerful storytelling while always bearing the risks that if their egos grow too big and their creative narcissism gets too well defended, they lose situational awareness, and they basically lose their feedback loop with reality. I visualize them almost flopping onto the bank of chaos. And so, if you look at it through this lens, then Pirsig wrestling with sanity towards the end of his life, Steve Jobs\u2019 magical thinking about his illness, and Eddie Lampert\u2019s Ayn Randian framing of his investment in Sears may have all been examples of these guys losing their feel for where they can mythologize to the point of bending our collective reality, and then they suddenly briefly appear crazy. I think Musk in particular drives hedge fund managers up the wall as half of them are short of shares because he exudes so much promotional hucksterism as he asserts reality, and half of them are long because he\u2019s actually thinking on a 100-year timescale. And that\u2019s very confusing. At East Rock, we always say that if you wanna have variant perception, it helps to be variant. And I remember interviewing Mike Burry, Steve Eisman, and all the other somewhat fringe, somewhat variant investors who were shorting subprime mortgages in 2006 and basically all the characters that Michael Lewis captured so accurately in The Big Short. And the housing bubble is obvious in retrospect, but at the time almost everyone thought they were completely smoking dope. And the current cryptocurrency scene reminds me a lot of the subprime short ecosystem because the opportunity attracts the more variant players who have nothing to lose from disrupting the status quo. So, on crypto, you\u2019ve got all the libertarians, and the unemployed macro hedge fund managers, and all the kids. There\u2019s this great quote by one of the characters in Tom Stoppard\u2019s play, Arcadia that the crypto guys like, which is \u201cThe future is disorder. A door like this has cracked open five or six times since we got up on our hind legs. It\u2019s the best possible time to be alive when almost everything you thought you knew was wrong.\u201d I think that mentality of saying, \u201cBring it on,\u201d to chaos, that now is the best possible time to be alive, to \u201clearn to love the rain,\u201d as Josh Waitzkin says is really hard for people who have succeeded in the status quo context. And so, I think bitcoin could just be a bubble due to QE post the financial crisis, or it could be a change in how we organize human activity at the level of the internet itself, or both. And I\u2019m, at the moment, trying to hold both perspectives without needing to decide yet. I\u2019m trying to stay \u2013 I think of it as open-sharing instead of striving for closure. I\u2019ll finish up the career question with one last quote from the very self-transforming Charlie Munger, who at 93 has no filters left, and he has more wisdom percentage than almost anyone I read. He says, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed in a long lifetime that the people who really love you are the people where you scramble together with difficulty, and you\u2019ve jointly gotten through. And in the end, those people will love you more than somebody who just shared in an even prosperity through the whole thing. So, this adversity that seems so awful when you\u2019re scrambling through actually is the sinecure of your success, your affection, every other damn thing. The idea that life is a series of adversities, and each one is an opportunity to behave well instead of badly is a very, very good idea.\u201d And he says, \u201cAnd it works so well in old age because you get so many adversities you can\u2019t fix. So, you better have some technique for welcoming those adversities.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Hey, guys. This is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. No. 1, this is 5-Bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me \u2013 would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend? And 5-Bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I\u2019ve found or that I\u2019ve been pondering over the week. That could include favorite new albums that I\u2019ve discovered. It could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I\u2019ve somehow dug up in the world of the esoteric, as I do. It could include favorite articles that I have read and that I\u2019ve shared with my close friends, for instance. And it\u2019s very short. It\u2019s just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend. So, if you want to receive that, check it out. Just go to fourhourworkweek.com, that\u2019s fourhourworkweek.com all spelled out, and just drop in your email, and you will get the very next one. And if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it.

like a tao te ching for artists that every time you read, lets you go deeper and deeper into this idea of overcoming the innate resistance that faces anybody who wants to make a change in their life, especially a creative one", "and every time i read it, it lights this crazy bonfire inside of me that reminds me just how far i have to go in order to trust the creative voices inside of me instead of the ego voices because that\u2019s the real crisis with all creative work is that it requires us to trust the silent voices, the ones that we actually don\u2019t hear as loud as the positive and

to what i said earlier about ivy leaguers and fragile egos", "columbia film school had this diabolical little system, which i don\u2019t even know if they still have today", "but after the first year, the faculty all got together and gave out this one big cash prize", "i think it was $16,000.00 to whoever they thought was the most promising director", "i ended up getting that prize, which ended up being a lot more of a curse than anything, since it directly led to the failure that happened next", "so, with my thesis film, i wanted to prove so badly that i deserved that prize, that i was the most promising director, that they put their faith in the right student", "so, the night before my jury showing, instead of being content with all the work i put into that film, i completely panicked and decided i should show it to one of the professors on the jury hoping that he\u2019d reassure me", "he didn\u2019t", "he thought it was slow and \u201cfeckless.\u201d that word still stings anytime i hear it or read it", "and he recommended i slash the whole movie to pieces and make it half the length", "instead of looking for a second opinion or balancing his feedback against my own thoughts of my work, i panicked liked i was a headless rooster", "this professor was obviously on the jury, and i wanted to stay the faculty\u2019s blessed son, and so i trusted external validation at this point in my life more than my own creative compass", "so, like a lemming, i followed his advice", "i spent the whole night undoing eight months\u2019 work and recutting the film", "and the next day, i presented this hacked up frankenstein to the faculty, who absolutely demolished it", "they literally thought it was the worst movie in our class, probably one of the worst movies they\u2019d seen come into the thesis presentations", "all credibility i\u2019d earned over the past three years went up in smoke", "i wasn\u2019t invited to participate in the public film school festival", "lots of gossip about how i never should have gotten that scholarship floated around, how i had no talent, how i\u2019d let the prize get to my head", "and of course it did, just not in the way that they all thought", "a few weeks later, i ran into one of those disappointed faculty members, one who\u2019d been a huge supporter of my work before this and now could barely look at me", "i told him the story of the last minute recutting i\u2019d done the night before my presentation, and he asked me if he could see the original version", "so, i showed it to him", "and i just remember the way his eyes lit up like stars", "and he said, \u201cah", "there you are", "now i see you.\u201d incidentally, that short film in its original version went on to great success", "and it started my whole career", "but here\u2019s the lesson that i remind myself of constantly, and which i hope you can take away from it, which is: don\u2019t let someone knock you off your course after you\u2019ve put in all the work", "you have to trust the work", "you have to always trust the work", "if you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say and why", "if i was in hollywood, the billboard would say, \u201cthey\u2019re lying.\u201d and i actually have to remind myself of this all the time", "every time i\u2019m on a call with a hollywood producer or studio executive, i actually pull up a screensaver with those two words, \u201cthey\u2019re lying,\u201d in all caps", "and i watch it spread across the screen during the call over and over", "and it makes the whole experience a lot more productive and less frustrating", "this reminds me of my first experience in hollywood", "i was coming out of film school", "i\u2019d written a script that a lot of producers and studios were interested in", "and at my first ever studio meeting, the exec sweeps into the room, crows it\u2019s the best script that he\u2019s ever read", "and he\u2019s like, \u201ckid, we are making this movie.\u201d and he slams his fists on the table", "after that meeting, i never heard from him again", "and obviously, he didn\u2019t make the movie", "but i think it\u2019s a depressing billboard to focus on hollywood\u2019s lies", "so, let\u2019s pick another one", "if i\u2019m anywhere but la, the billboard would say, \u201cif you can conceive of it, it\u2019s probably wrong.\u201d and use of meditation taught me that most of the ideas, and opinions, and rules, and fixed systems i have in my mind aren\u2019t the real truth", "they\u2019re the residues of past experience that i haven\u2019t found a way to let go of", "and to be open to life, to be truly ourselves, it\u2019s our job to be aware, only aware, not to clutter that precious awareness with judgements", "so, i need meditation as my primary weapon to survive life, to let me study my own brain like a detective looking for thoughts or thought patterns that i can let go of because the secret to happiness, i\u2019ve learned isn\u2019t really happiness at all, but cultivating silence inside of me", "this big, blank, beautiful space", "and the only way i know how to make more blank space is through meditation", "so, 20 minutes a day every day, wherever i am", "often, i use the headspace app because it logs your progress", "so, it gives you a little bit of an incentive to keep a streak going", "but all you need is a comfortable chair and silence, and meditation becomes the portal to the rest of my day", "what is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made", "oh, it\u2019s definitely flying trapeze lessons", "those are like shock therapy for the soul because as soon as you get on the platform for your first class, it\u2019s 50 feet high", "and so, you\u2019re instantly making all these cerebral calculations", "you\u2019re like, \u201ci\u2019m gonna jump this way, and then i\u2019m gonna do this", "and then my legs are gonna go over the bar here, and i\u2019m gonna drop into the net there.\u201d and it\u2019s all complete and utter bs because once you jump off the platform; you realize in an instant that you have two choices", "either you trust your body, or you die", "and for someone who makes a living with my head, i need that kind of primal therapy to reintegrate with my body in a very forceful, violent way", "and just one class made me realize that underneath my mind\u2019s chatter, my body actually has everything under control if i\u2019m willing to just take the plunge and fly", "this reminds me of a related story which is that i\u2019m a compulsive crossfitter", "and at first, my favorite skill when i started the classes was box jumps", "it felt so controllable that if you just jump on a box of a certain height, and you clear it, you get to build the box higher and try again", "it was linear, it was pavlovian, and it rewards a control freak like me in the clearest possible way", "but at some point i hit a plateau, and i couldn\u2019t jump any higher", "i got frustrated", "i tried to will myself higher", "i was watching youtube videos all day trying to find out what i was doing wrong", "and it just led to me forcing it again, and again, and again, and compromising my form and wiping out a lot", "and no matter how much i grit my teeth and did it again and again, i couldn\u2019t get past my max of 42 inches", "so, i finally said, \u201cthat\u2019s my max.\u201d i told my trainer, dave", "i said, \u201c42 inches", "that\u2019s it", "that\u2019s my complete max.\u201d and he disagreed", "he\u2019s like, \u201cyou\u2019ve gotten to this height by jumping", "anyone can jump", "you can control a jump", "but the only way you\u2019re going to get any higher is by flying", "and you can\u2019t think your way through flight.\u201d so, i had to relearn box jumping to get past my self-imposed max, my cerebral max, and find my real maximum", "and this required the same trust in my body as the trapeze did", "jump, commit, let the body do the work", "and if there\u2019s one thing you can take from this, it\u2019s that you can find something in your own life that forces you to have this experience", "jump, commit, let the body do the work", "whether those trapeze lessons, or an improv class, or just freestyle dancing in your room to rhianna, let your body show you its natural intelligence", "give it the chance to show you", "it\u2019s gonna be the most intimate experience you ever have with yourself", "what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love", "i feel like this is a guilty pleasures question", "and i have so many of those", "everything from celine dion to peanut butter slathered popcorn to the movie showgirls to that horrible tv show alf", "but here\u2019s one i guess that\u2019s more important to me", "it\u2019s not something i confess regularly", "but every night before i go to bed, i pull out old issues of archie comics and read them", "it\u2019s not a new habit", "i used to read archie as a kid before i went to bed back then, also", "and it\u2019s because riverdale in the comic always seems so crisp and bright and welcoming", "riverdale was the complete opposite of the kind of school i went to, which always felt so dark and morose and always made me feel scared somehow before having to go there on monday mornings", "and so, just reading the archie comics gave me a little soothing warm feeling before i drifted off to sleep that i still get to this very day when i read them", "but maybe more importantly, closing the day by reading the same thing i did when i was younger gives my life this sense of perfect order somehow", "maybe there\u2019s a deeper lesson in this, also", "i know i\u2019m technically a writer of young adult literature, but i never think of my audience that way", "or i never think of myself as a writer for kids because i think the things we love when we\u2019re young are still the things we love when we\u2019re older", "we just forget", "or we give up", "or we \u201cgrow up.\u201d and that\u2019s why the old fairy tales always held so much power for me because they worked for everyone, young or old", "it didn\u2019t matter who you were", "just like archie works for me young or old", "and so, maybe we all grow up in body one day, but i\u2019m not sure our soul ever does", "and that\u2019s why the best stories somehow can touch us all and transcend things like age, or nationality, or culture, or anything like that", "that\u2019s why the best stories are universal", "in the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life", "i know i should offer something deeply profound here, but honestly, the thing that\u2019s most improved my life in the last year is unfollowing hot people on instagram", "there\u2019s this amazing short story by ted chiang that started all this called \u201cliking what you see\u201d that did a real number on me", "the story asserts that beauty has become this kind of alien modern day super drug that with filters and facetune on social media, and retouched models on ads, and porn so easily accessible, we\u2019ve completely overloaded the senses and overstimulated ourselves so that our natural instincts can no longer recognize or react to real beauty anymore", "and that\u2019s making us confused and miserable both in how we judge ourselves and also how we judge others", "and that crystal clear warning that beauty is literally ruining our lives like the worst drug woke me up because if we\u2019re not careful, and this is where i fell into this trap and was completely guilty of it, our social media feeds become filled with people we follow only because they\u2019re beautiful or because we\u2019re envious of their lives", "and without really realizing it, your feed turns into this torture device, an assault of beauty and perfection designed to make you feel inadequate", "and so, opening up instagram doesn\u2019t inspire you anymore", "it just makes you start to hate-live your own life since you can\u2019t possibly measure up to the gods and goddesses of all these perfectly filtered pictures", "and it makes you intolerant of other peoples\u2019 real imperfections", "and then it makes you start to despise the weight of real people and real life and invest in shallow, flimsy, 2d mirrors of it", "it makes you constantly judge your own life against others", "it makes you fragment your own consciousness because you\u2019re living outside of your own life in order to get the perfect picture of it", "it\u2019s completely and utterly deadly", "and so, i would say you have to use social media to make yourself better, to make yourself feel better, not to punish yourself", "and that honestly has been the most valuable change in my life in the last couple years", "what advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the real world", "let\u2019s start with the advice that i\u2019d give, which is make sure that you have something every day that you\u2019re looking forward to", "hopefully, it\u2019s your job", "but if it\u2019s not, which is a completely universal and understandable condition, maybe it\u2019s a basketball game after work, or a voice lesson, or your writing group, or an open mic night", "maybe it\u2019s a date", "have something every day that lights you up because it\u2019ll keep your soul hungry to create more of these moments instead of getting dragged down into the rut of having a job that you\u2019re not excited about", "and i\u2019ll also remind you what really fulfills you in life", "when i was a pharmaceutical consultant, and i was completely miserable, i used to come home from work and work on my novel that would eventually become the school for good and evil", "i never intended to publish it", "i never intended anyone to read it", "i just did it to offset the misery of a job that i hated", "and over time, i loved writing the book so much that i used to leave early sometimes in order to work on it", "and slowly, the novel started to take over my work life too", "i found myself secretly working on it in the mornings, during meetings, in the corner during office, during lunch", "and eventually, i got fired because they figured out i wasn\u2019t doing any of the real work, and i was actually working on my book", "and the truth was i wasn\u2019t upset because i had discovered what had made me happy at that point, which was telling stories", "and nothing was gonna put that genie back in the bottle", "as for advice i\u2019d ignore, a little part of me dies every time someone tells me that they\u2019ve taken a job as a stepping stone to something else when they clearly have no interest in that job whatsoever", "and i think it\u2019s because the truth is you only have one life to live", "time is super valuable", "it\u2019s the one currency that we\u2019re all fighting to get more of", "and so, if you\u2019re using the idea of stepping stones and jobs that you\u2019re not really interested in to get somewhere else, you\u2019re probably relying on somebody else\u2019s path or definitions of success that was created in the past", "and i think it\u2019s more important to live in your own present and try to make your own path", "it\u2019s gonna end up being more fulfilling for your own life", "what are bad recommendations that you hear in your profession or are of expertise", "i think too often, aspiring artists put this pressure on themselves to make the creative work their only source of income, that they can\u2019t be an artist unless they\u2019re a fulltime artist somehow", "and in my experience, it\u2019s just a road to complete and utter misery because if art is your only source of income, then there\u2019s unrelenting pressure on that art", "and mercenary pressure isn\u2019t just the enemy of the creative elves inside you trying to get the work done, but mercenary pressure also often leads to really bad and rushed work", "so, having another stream of income drains the pressure on your creative engine", "if nothing comes of your art or it flops miserably, whatever", "you still have an ironclad plan to support yourself", "and so, your creative soul feels a lot lighter", "it feels free to do its best work", "and i\u2019m still a personal practitioner of this even though i could easily be a fulltime writer because after four books and a movie deal, i want a separate side stream of income in order to be able to write without feeling like it\u2019s a matter of life and death", "so, i tutor kids on the side", "i help them with their college applications", "and i\u2019ve been doing that for the last ten years", "and really no plans to stop because it makes the books better in the end if i don\u2019t feel like the books are my only source of livelihood", "in the last five years, what have you become better at saying, \u201cno,\u201d to", "i\u2019m convinced that the reason hollywood movies are often so terrible is because everyone is so busy hedging their bets that they\u2019re working on a thousand projects at once", "they don\u2019t wanna commit to anything for fear that it\u2019s gonna fail", "no one is giving anything their full focus", "so, when i worked on the school for good and evil, i decided to take the opposite track", "i decided to commit completely", "and the series has taught me to be patient because when i\u2019m writing a new book, that\u2019s all i work on", "and i say, \u201cno,\u201d to all other creative projects no matter how lucrative", "do i miss opportunities", "absolutely", "but it means that when the books hit the shelves, i know that i have left everything on the page, and they\u2019re the absolute best i could have done, which then gives the series the greatest chance to survive through time", "it\u2019s easier to say, \u201cno,\u201d though when professionally, i know what my driving need is because if your driving need is to build income and provide for your family, then you\u2019ll say no to anything that doesn\u2019t further that goal", "but if your driving need is to have your own business, for example, then you need to be a bit more promiscuous in trying out ideas until the right one hits", "in my case, my driving need is always unequivocal, which is i want to make something that lasts", "and that means committing to my current work like a marriage and believing that if i give these six books in the series everything i have, then better opportunities will eventually rise to replace the ones that i\u2019ve passed up", "when you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do", "so, feeling overwhelmed usually means one of two things", "either my blood\u2019s trapped in my head, and i need to get out there and exercise and move the blood around and give myself space to breathe, or more likely, my to do list has become completely overpacked, and my brain knows there\u2019s no way i can reasonably get done everything i\u2019ve set out to do", "and so, that\u2019s been the solution is taking out the calendar and start canceling things, moving things around, seeing what i can take off my plate", "and then, i can feel the paralysis evaporate once i\u2019ve hit that threshold of knowing that i can reasonably accomplish whatever i want to do now", "feeling unfocused is a little different because it usually means i haven\u2019t quite locked in to whatever i\u2019m working on, that a part of me still thinks i can ripcord and bail and is afraid to commit", "it usually happens in the first three months of writing a new book because that lack of focus is usually just fear", "fear that the new book is terrible, fear that it\u2019s going to fail miserably and sink my career", "early on, i used to give in to that fear", "and four books later now, i know that i just have to hold on tight, grit my teeth, and blow right through it like a ghost", "our guest today is susan cain", "c-a-i-n", "on twitter @susancain", "facebook: author susan cain", "quietrev.com is her website", "susan is the cofounder of quiet revolution and the author of the bestsellers quiet power subtitle: the secret strengths of introverted kids and quiet subtitle: the power of introverts in a world that can\u2019t stop talking, which has been translated into 40 languages and has been on the new york times bestseller list for more than four years straight", "quiet was named the best book of the year by fast company magazine, which also named susan one of its most creative people in business", "susan is the cofounder of the quiet schools network and the quiet leadership institute", "and her writing has appeared in the new york times, the atlantic, the wall street journal, and other publications", "her ted talk has been viewed more than 17 million times, probably more than 20 million at this point, and was named by bill gates as one of his all-time favorite talks", "how has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success", "do you have any favorite failure of yours", "so, a very long time ago, i used to be a corporate lawyer", "and i was a very ambivalent corporate lawyer", "and anyone could have told you that i was in the wrong profession", "but still, i had dedicated tons of time to it: three years of law school, one year of clerking for a federal judge, six and a half years at a wall street law firm, and i had a lot of very deep relationships with fellow attorneys", "but the day came when i was very well along on partnership track, that the senior partner in my firm came to my office and sat down and told me that i would not be put up for partner on schedule", "and to this day, i really don\u2019t know whether he met that i would never be put up for partner or just delayed for a long time", "but all i know is that i burst into tears right in front of him and then asked for a leave of absence", "and i left work that day, and i remember bicycling around and around central park in new york city having no idea what i was gonna do next", "i thought i\u2019d probably travel", "and i had all kinds of plans to go to india and so on", "but instead, and this all happened in such a sudden and cinematic way that it will defy belief, but what happened is i remembered that i had always wanted to be a writer, which seems strange", "you would think i had always had that in the back of my mind, but my writing dreams were something i had forgotten about for a very long time", "but i started writing that very night", "and then the next day, i signed up for a class at nyu in creative nonfiction writing", "and the next week, i went to the very first session of that class, and it really was like an epiphany moment", "i felt like i was finally home", "i had no expectation of ever making a living through writing because you always hear about how difficult that is, but it was clear to me that from then on, i was gonna put writing at my center", "and so, i decided to just look for freelance work that would give me lots of free time to feed my hobby", "now, if i had succeeded at making partner on schedule, i might still be there today, miserably negotiating corporate transactions 16 hours a day", "it\u2019s not that i had never thought about what else i might want to do other than law, but there\u2019s something about being inside a very intense, 16-hour-a-day, hermetic culture like a law practice that makes it really difficult to figure out what else you might wanna do", "what is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made", "the best investment i ever made was the seven years of time that it took me to write quiet", "i really didn\u2019t care how long it took", "and though i very much wanted the book to succeed, i felt good about that investment of time regardless of the outcome because i really didn\u2019t know what was gonna happen", "but i felt so certain that writing in general and that writing that book in particular was the right thing to do", "first of all, i had two kids along the way", "so, of course that slowed me down", "but also, i handed in a first draft after the first two years, and my editor basically said, \u201cthis is very crappy.\u201d and she said, \u201ctake all the time you need and start from scratch and go home and get it right.\u201d and you might think that that was a moment of grand discouragement, but it was actually exactly the opposite", "i remember leaving her office elated because i agreed with her", "and i knew i needed a lot of time to get it right", "and i was thrilled that the publisher was giving it to me", "i had never published a word before quiet, and i felt like i was learning how to write a book from scratch", "and most publishing houses rush books to market a long time before they\u2019re really, fully done just because of economic exigencies", "and i feel like if she had done that, there would be no quiet revolution", "what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love", "i really love sad, minor key music", "and the funny thing is i find that kind of music very elevating and transcendent and not actually sad at all", "and i think it\u2019s because this kind of music is really about the fragility and the preciousness of life and love", "so, if you\u2019re curious about some examples, for me leonard cohen is my patron saint", "you could try listening to \u201cdance me to the end of love,\u201d or to \u201cfamous blue raincoat,\u201d or pretty much to anything that he\u2019s ever written", "if you\u2019re not familiar with his work, i\u2019m sure you know his song, \u201challelujah\u201d that has been made into a cover a gazillion times", "but that really is only the tip of the leonard iceberg", "i also love this song called \u201chinach yafah\u201d by an amazing guy named idan raichel", "it\u2019s a really gorgeous song of a man longing for his beloved, and it\u2019s really about longing in general, whether longing for god, or for heaven, or whatever", "my favorite word in any language is the word saudade, which is the portuguese word that\u2019s at the heart of brazilian and portuguese culture and music", "and it basically means a kind of sweet longing for a beloved thing or person that will likely never return to you", "and i know that sounds so desperately sad, but again, it\u2019s so hard to articulate it, but there\u2019s something so incredibly beautiful and transcendent in that very idea", "and if you wanna hear music expressing that idea, you could try a band called madredeus or the singer ces\u00e1ria", "i\u2019m not sure i\u2019m pronouncing her name correctly, but ces\u00e1ria \u00e9vora", "something like that", "and by the way, my next book, or my whole next work chapter of my life is all about this topic of how loss and longing are such an essential part of love, and art, and growth in general", "what advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the real world", "susan cain:\u00a0\u00a0 smart, driven college student", "you\u2019re gonna hear so many stories of people who risked everything in order to achieve this goal or that goal, especially when it comes to creative goals", "but i don\u2019t believe that your best creative work is done when you\u2019re stressed out because you\u2019re on the edge of bankruptcy or some other personal disaster", "it\u2019s really just the opposite", "so, you should be setting up your life in a way that\u2019s as comfortable and as happy as possible, and that often means setting it up in a way that doesn\u2019t appear very creative on the outside because you\u2019re tapping in to more conservative structures, but what you\u2019re really doing is freeing yourself up to accommodate your creative work", "so, i often ask myself whether all those years of wall street law were a waste, given that what i really was meant, i think, to be doing the whole time was to explore human psychology and do what i love to do now, writing about what it\u2019s like to be alive", "it\u2019s really how i think of my work", "but the answer is that no", "it was totally not a waste for so many reasons, first of all because i learned so much about this so called real world that would have otherwise been a mystery to me, and second because a front row seat at a wall street negotiation is as good a place as any to study the ridiculousness of being human, but most of all, maybe, is because those years that i spent practicing law gave me a financial cushion when i was ready to use it to try out a creative life", "it wasn\u2019t a huge cushion", "i had not managed to save that much", "but it did make a huge difference", "so, even once i started my writing life, i spent tons of time setting up this little freelance business on the side where i taught people negotiation skills", "and it was something that i felt i could use as long as i needed to support myself when my real center always was writing", "the thing i was trying to do the whole time was take the pressure off the writing, so that the writing could always be a source of joy and satisfaction", "so, i told myself that my goal was to get something published by the time i was 75 years old", "and that was it", "so, i met my goal a lot earlier than that", "so, i am not saying, by the way, that the smart, driven college student who wants to have a creative life should spend ten years in corporate finance first", "i\u2019m very much not saying that", "i\u2019m really making a more basic point that you should just be planning how you\u2019re gonna make ends meet and have a way to do that", "and that way, the time that you do spend on your creative projects, and it could be 30 minutes a day, it could be ten hours a day, but you want those moments to be about focus, and flow, and occasional glimpses of joy", "you do not want them to be associated with financial stress", "when you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do", "susan cain:\u00a0\u00a0 i love espresso, and i would happily consume it all day long, but i\u2019m really afraid of habituating to it and losing its magic powers", "so, i only allow myself to have one latte a day", "and i save it for when i\u2019m doing my most creative work of the day because it really does jumpstart my mind in this almost magical \u2013 it has a kind of magical power", "and also, by now, i associate latte in a kind of pavlovian way with writing, which then gets associated in a pavlovian way with the pleasure of coffee", "so, it\u2019s all a really good feedback loop", "my guest today is graham duncan", "you can find out more about him at eastrockcap \u2013 c-a-p \u2013 .com", "graham is the cofounder of east rock capital, an investment firm that manages $2 billion or so for a small number of families and their charitable foundations", "before starting east rock 12 years ago, graham worked at two other investment firms", "he started his career by cofounding the independent wall street research firm,

"i\u2019ll give you a hint: searching for bobby fischer", "josh calls graham, \u201cthe tip of the spear in the realms of talent tracking in judgment of human potential in high-stakes mental arenas.\u201d that is a mouthful, but graham, as i\u2019ve gotten to know him over the years, is more and more impressive with every encounter that i have with him", "and if you wanna hear more from

wear the subpac wearable physical sound system while i commute on the subway to my office", "and sometimes i wear it while i work at my desk", "you strap the system to your back and chest, and it lets you feel the vibration of music through your whole body", "music producers, gamers, and deaf people are the primary users", "i find the full body experience of music makes listening to music, or even a podcast that has a lot of bass, more of an immersive somatic experience rather than just a conceptual head thing", "if you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say and why", "so, i have two candidates", "first, \u201cit\u2019s not how well you play the game", "it\u2019s deciding what game you wanna play.\u201d that\u2019s by kwame appiah who\u2019s a philosophy professor at nyu", "and i like it because it separates striving from strategy, and it reminds me to take a macro view of whatever i\u2019m doing, like in a video game where you can zoom out, and you suddenly see you\u2019ve been running around in one corner of the maze", "it loosens my relationship to the game too", "it\u2019s the game of the game, helping to separate having ambition from being ambitious, or accessing hustle without actually becoming a hustler", "another quote that i really like is form the buddhist novelist george saunders, who said in an interview with the new yorker that he has an image of people\u2019s \u201cnectar in decaying containers.\u201d buddhists like saunders think everyone has a buddha nature, that good core of your being", "some people sometimes lose track of it, but it\u2019s there", "and i think it\u2019s such a good assumption to have about everyone even if you\u2019re wrong sometimes, that that\u2019s there", "and i also love that image of \u201cnectar in decaying containers.\u201d it helps me visualize the stream of buddha nature flowing through all the lovely, flawed, living, and slowly dying creatures that we all encounter every day", "and i sometimes get this glimpse of how my three-year-old daughter\u2019s three-year-old self is so temporary", "buddhists like to say we\u2019re all on fire, and it\u2019s so beautiful to sometime tune in and just see the flickering", "what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life", "so, the psychiatrist sam barondes has a book called making sense of people that\u2019s had a huge impact on my thinking", "and i sometimes give a copy to people who are building a new team and doing a lot of hiring, or even a friend that might be deciding whether or not to get engaged", "as part of my role as an investor, i interview four to five hundred people a year to decide whether to hire them or invest in their various startups or investment funds", "the most useful mental model i\u2019ve found to help me understand what makes people tick is the one that barondes describes eloquently in his book", "the model is called the \u201cbig five,\u201d or ocean", "and the o stands for open-minded", "the c stands for conscientious", "the e for extroverted", "a for agreeable", "n for neurotic", "and the academics who developed the model clumped every english adjective that could be used to describe somebody into categories, and then they reduced them to as small a set of factors as they could", "so, if lots of people agreed they could call somebody both gregarious and outgoing, then they decided that was the same thing", "and they kept reducing that down until they got, say, extroversion as a primary factor", "and in the academic literature on personality, the big five is like the equivalent of gravity", "there have been thousands of studies, and it\u2019s considered much more statistically accurate than alternatives such as myers-briggs", "and so, if you want to picture it like for high open-minded, picture leonardo da vinci", "for high conscientious picture robocop", "for high extroverted, picture bill clinton", "and for the opposite, high introverted, picture obama", "for low neuroticism, picture the dude from the big lebowski or any stereotypical californian", "and for high neuroticism, picture woody allen, or kanye west, or most new yorkers", "i could free associate about the big five, but i\u2019ll leave it there", "if you want more then check out sam barondes book, and scott barry kaufman is also obsessed with the big five and writes a bunch of useful stuff about it", "there are two other mental models that have greatly influenced my thinking about people and teams.\u00a0 the first is harvard professor robert kegan\u2019s model of adult development", "kegan argues that adults develop and make sense of reality in five discreet phases", "he lays out his theory in his 1994 book in over our heads, which is unfortunately not available on kindle, but is available in paperback", "and the title in over our heads is a reference to how the vast majority of adult americans are at the \u201csocialized\u201d stage of development", "he calls it level three", "they have difficulty taking other people\u2019s perspectives, and they tend to follow assumptions given to them by society (as opposed to assumptions they freely choose)", "and he puts out in modern life that many activities such as parenting benefit if you can set boundaries and not care what your kid thinks", "you need to direct them in doing what you think they should do", "i feel like i sometimes see what i imagine to be socialized stage parents who are almost of their kid on some level", "they take what their kids think too seriously, and they wanna be their friends first and parents second", "when i\u2019m interviewing somebody, there\u2019s something that can feel a little bit icy when you\u2019re interacting with self-authored people because they aren\u2019t sourcing their approval from you", "there\u2019s something about the tone of the interview that is distinctive", "and to try to make this more concrete, there\u2019s this amazing example in chapter 9 of in over our heads, where kegan describes a couple who are both operating from a self-authored mindset", "and it\u2019s a very distinctive description of the way they make sense of each other and of being married that totally reminds me of one of tim\u2019s podcasts with laird hamilton and gabby reece where gabby is describing the way she relates to laird and to their marriage in a way that, to my ear, is a super unusual, self-authored way", "for people who are interested in learning more about the model, i recommend kegan\u2019s later book, immunity to change where he describes the model briefly at the beginning of the book", "i\u2019ll read a quick excerpt, just so people have a feel", "\u201chaving a socialized mind dramatically influences the sending and receiving of information at work", "if this is the level of mental complexity through which i view the world, then what i send will be strongly influenced by what i believe others want to hear", "let\u2019s contrast this with the self-authoring mind", "if i view the world from this level of mental complexity, what i send is more likely to be a function of what i deem others need to hear to best further the agenda or mission of my design", "consciously or unconsciously, i have a direction, an agenda, a stance, a strategy, an analysis of what is needed, a prior context from which my communication arises", "the self-authoring mind creates a filter for what it will allow to come through", "it places a priority on receiving the information it has sought", "information that i haven\u2019t asked for and which does not have obvious relevance to my own design for action has a much tougher time making it through my filter", "it\u2019s easy to see how all of this could describe an admirable capacity for focus, for distinguishing the important from the urgent, for making best use of one\u2019s limited time by having a means to cut through the unending and ever mounting claims on one\u2019s attention", "this speaks to the way the self-authoring mind is then advanced over the socialized mind", "but the same description may also be a recipe for disaster if one\u2019s plan or stance is flawed in some way, if it leaves out some crucial element of the equation not appreciated by the filter, or if the world changes in such a way that a once good frame becomes an antiquated one", "in contrast, the self-transforming mind both values and is wary about any one stance analysis or agenda", "it is mindful that powerful though a given design might be, this design almost inevitably leaves something out", "it is aware that it lives in time, and that the world is in motion, and that what might have made sense today may not make as much sense tomorrow", "therefore, when communicating, people with self-transforming minds are not only advancing their agenda and design, they\u2019re also inquiring about the design itself", "information sending is not just on behalf of driving", "it is also to remake the map or reset the direction", "if someone wants to hear how a person sounds when they make sense of reality at the self-transforming stage, then i\u2019d direct them to listen to tim\u2019s early podcast with ed catmull, the pixar founder and president", "the loose but strong grip that catmull has on his own beliefs, his fluid and flexible relationship to time, there\u2019s a slightly ephemeral quality and comfort with paradox that comes through in the interview", "in tim\u2019s interview with him, he\u2019s actually a bit of a difficult interviewee, and he feels a little hard to pin down at times", "for instance, he refuses to answer tim\u2019s question about what he would tell his 20-year-old self because he says now he has a way of understanding that his 20-year-old self simply couldn\u2019t understand", "this is all very consistent with a self-transforming mindset, which happens later in life for most people if it happens at all", "as an example, it would surprise me to hear catmull say or think any version of \u201ci\u2019m just trying to stay relevant\u201d as he gets older", "and from one perspective, he might be losing ground versus younger people in this industry, or he fails to get his phone calls returned", "but his way of making sense is likely that he gets to define who or what is relevant, not his peers in silicon valley or the movie industry", "one last self-transforming example i would is the voice of the narrator of \u201cthe parable\u201d by louise gluck", "if you google it, she\u2019s really amazing", "the third mental model that i find myself recommending lately is not in a book, but on a slightly obscure website called workwithsource.com, and it\u2019s based on a european management consultant who studied hundreds of startups and realized that even when there are multiple cofounders, there\u2019s actually always, in every case he found, an actual single \u201csource\u201d: the person who took the first risk on a new initiative, even if that risk was only picking up the phone and calling the other cofounder", "and he argues that that source maintains a unique relationship with what he calls the gestalt of the original idea", "and that person has an intuitive knowledge of what the right next step for the initiative is, whereas others who join later to help with the execution often lack that intuitive connection to the founder\u2019s original insight", "and these guys argue that many organizational tensions and power struggles actually often revolve around lack of explicit acknowledgement of who the source of the initiative is", "i was talking about this with a prominent angel investor recently, and he had found that consistent with his sample of startups", "and he noted that many founders seemed to hire friends as cofounders more to quell their own anxiety during the early, highly ambiguous days of a new company than to fulfil a specific role", "this can work fine as long as everyone is clear on who the source is", "and what\u2019s a little paradoxical here is that the responsibility to fully own the role of source rests in large part with the source themselves", "handing off the source role of an initiative to another person is possible but extremely difficult, and it\u2019s often mishandled", "and these guys note that a key to a successful transition is for the original source to actually move on and allow the new leader room to move", "i was speaking with an investment manager about this, and it was consistent with a study he\u2019d done of stock performance following founder ceos departing their businesses", "and he found that any subsequent positive stock performance was correlated with the founder completely leaving the board rather than hanging around to mentor the next ceo", "so, through that lens, gates remaining on the microsoft board during ballmer\u2019s tenure may have contributed to subsequent lackluster stock performance and ballmer\u2019s inability to exert his own creative vision, whereas ballmer leaving the board has allowed satya nadella to fully exert his own creative vision", "i encounter this dynamic myself sometimes in running a multifamily office where we manage money for forbes 500 families", "and second and third generations sometimes struggle with how to relate to the original patriarch and the \u201csource\u201d or their wealth", "in my observation, it\u2019s often that room for real transition is in the hands of the original source", "it\u2019s the lesson from george washington\u2019s song in the hamilton musical, as washington declines hamilton\u2019s plea to run for a third term, and he sings, \u201cwe\u2019re going to teach them how to say goodbye.\u201d what purchase of $100.00 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months or in recent memory", "so, i recently bought the finis, f-i-n-i-s, swim paddles", "they somewhat magically lengthen out my freestyle stroke", "and when i combined them with some fins, i use the ones cressi, c-r-e-s-s-i, i feel sometimes like i\u2019m almost flying through the water", "for non-swimmers, i highly recommend the canned sardines from matiz, m-a-t-i-z", "i feel like one of my proudest accomplishments as a dad is that my two younger kids eat sardines with me most mornings for breakfast", "they\u2019re super high protein and high good fats", "there\u2019s no need to supplement fish oil", "and matiz sardines aren\u2019t fishy", "i usually add avocado with salt and lemon, and the kids love them", "and i often alternate the sardines with canned wild salmon belly, which they call restreca, r-e-s-t-r-e-c-a, from the company vital choice", "the bonus on both of those is that when the zombie apocalypse comes, you\u2019ll have canned food ready to go", "how has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success", "do you have any favorite failure of yours", "i have so many failures", "i\u2019m just gonna pick one", "in my role in investing in and seeding investment firms, i do really extensive reference checks on people in order to try to accelerate the process of building mutual trust with them", "and i should note that i have a somewhat oddly specific aspiration to be among the best in the world in terms of being able to really do a reference on someone", "i feel like it\u2019s a real art form to gather private information in the form of multiple perspectives about how someone has played a repeat iteration game in the past and then try to accurately project how they\u2019re gonna play in the future", "and i define success as gathering enough honest perspectives on someone to mimic how i would know someone if i had sat next to them at work for five years", "at east rock, we try to do references in person, and it\u2019s a huge time investment", "in late 2007, i was about to back a firm, and we conducted a final reference check with the investment manager\u2019s former boss who was quite negative and skeptical about his former analyst", "i remember i asked him what percentile the analyst was in terms of all the analysts who had ever worked for him, and he said top 60 percent, which i thought i misheard at first", "and i\u2019ve never gotten that response again in a reference", "and it surprised me, given that the analyst had given me this guy\u2019s name as a reference", "it wasn\u2019t an off-list reference", "it was on his list", "and it made me pause on proceeding with the investment, which then proceeded to work out amazingly well as the financial crisis unfolded, and i had a lot of regret about the size of the profits i missed", "later on, it emerged that the reference source may have had an agenda to sabotage his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s new firm", "then several years later, i was evaluating another investment manager to partner with, and toward the end of our diligence process, i got another reference not quite as negative as that one, but it was mixed", "but i felt like at this point, i was better able to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously without experience cognitive dissonance", "it\u2019s like the state of negative capability that keats referred to as useful to writers", "and this time, having those mixed data points only made me do more work, and i gained even more conviction in the character and competence of the investment manager", "and that investment has ended up being super profitable", "and i think absent my earlier failure, i wouldn\u2019t have had the ability to see the reality of the situation", "and it also just helped me appreciate something i try to do, which is i try to hold people\u2019s perspectives with a light grip, which the knowledge that they and i have very incomplete maps of reality", "what are bad recommendations that you hear in your profession or area of expertise", "so, i think people massively overuse the term \u201chedge fund.\u201d they fetishize it a little too much", "and it reminds me a little bit of a similar issue that ray dalio found when he used the word depression in 2008 to describe some of the underlaying dynamics in the economy", "he found that his readers had too much baggage with the word, so he switched to using the word \u201cdeprocess.\u201d and yuval harari makes a similar reframing move by referring to us as sapiens because we have so much baggage about being human and being in the center of the most important species", "and in a similar way, i think people now have way too much baggage with the word \u201chedge fund.\u201d the press and the managers themselves have made it almost jump the shark", "and i\u2019ve been telling people lately, i think we should start using \u201ch structure\u201d or something like that to instead capture the concept of incentive compensation", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to see a hedge fund, or a product, or even the hedge fund industry because these are just temporary constructions of flawed, brilliant people, who in any given year decide to make a sequel to the movie they made the prior year", "the only product is the set of future decisions that the portfolio manager make", "if they get divorced, or depressed, if their second in command leaves, the \u201cproduct\u201d completely changes", "and i think thinking of it as a product ignores the reality that the only source of stability is actually whether the mindset of the team leader is resilient or even antifragile, which is nassim taleb\u2019s thing about it actually getting stronger with volatility rather than just enduring it", "when you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do", "so, i ask myself, \u201cwhat would be the worst thing about that outcome not going the way i want?\u201d i had actually starting using it out loud with my kids, and recently, my eight-year-old daughter started asking it back to me, which was karmic full circle", "i really like to be punctual, and we were late to drop her at school", "and i was impatiently hurrying her along", "and she asked me, \u201cdad, what exactly would be the worst thing about being late?\u201d and in the moment, it completely shifted my mindset", "i like the question because it often surfaces a hidden assumption", "in this case, maybe some subconscious script of, \u201ci\u2019m playing the role of father, and our family meets our commitments,\u201d or some version of that", "and another good related question is byron katie\u2019s thing about can the opposite of your story be true", "i think that question serves the same role", "in the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life", "i\u2019ve begun swimming most mornings, and i find it often shifts my mindset for the entire rest of my day", "some swimmers talk about this concept of \u201cwater feel,\u201d which is getting a grip in the water and pulling your body past that point instead of ripping your hand through the water", "ripping your hand through the water moves you forward, but it\u2019s a lot less efficient, and it\u2019s less graceful", "and i really like david foster wallace\u2019s speech, \u201cthis is water,\u201d where he\u2019s making the point that so much of life is water to us", "we\u2019re swimming in it", "we can\u2019t see it because we\u2019re either in a hurry or not awake to our context", "or in kegan language, we are subject to it", "and when i stop to really feel the water before i pull, it shifts my way of being from one of thrashing toward the end of the pool somewhat mindlessly to a more effortless flow of working with the reality of the water where i am", "what advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the real world", "so lately, i\u2019ve been thinking about careers through dan siegel\u2019s model of mental health where he says, \u201cpicture a river flowing between two banks where one side is chaos and the other side is rigidity.\u201d and dan points out that mental illnesses all reside on one bank or the other", "schizophrenia is on the chaos side", "ocd is rigidity", "and basically, a healthy integration is swimming in the middle of the river, says the argument", "and most college students have started life closer to the rigidity bank is my observation and over the course of their careers will experiment with swimming toward the middle", "and i\u2019ve come to think of the lane right next to the rigidity bank as an appropriately conventional one for when you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s and you\u2019re acquiring the skill of refining reality", "it\u2019s a place to swim where it\u2019s important to learn the jargon of an industry and apprentice under somebody, to develop judgment and discover your own zone of genius", "and i think swimming in the middle lane happens most often in people\u2019s 30\u2019s or 40\u2019s", "it\u2019s a stage where you begin crafting your own language for what you do", "as an increasingly strong poet, you make your craft your own", "you view your life as more self-expression than simply playing out other people\u2019s roles for you", "and then some small percentage of people will paddle over to the lane next to chaos, which is the place where you find novelists like robert pirsig and david foster wallace, investors like mike burry or eddie lampert, or entrepreneurs like steve jobs and elon musk", "and i experience them as consistently asserting reality through powerful storytelling while always bearing the risks that if their egos grow too big and their creative narcissism gets too well defended, they lose situational awareness, and they basically lose their feedback loop with reality", "i visualize them almost flopping onto the bank of chaos", "and so, if you look at it through this lens, then pirsig wrestling with sanity towards the end of his life, steve jobs\u2019 magical thinking about his illness, and eddie lampert\u2019s ayn randian framing of his investment in sears may have all been examples of these guys losing their feel for where they can mythologize to the point of bending our collective reality, and then they suddenly briefly appear crazy", "i think musk in particular drives hedge fund managers up the wall as half of them are short of shares because he exudes so much promotional hucksterism as he asserts reality, and half of them are long because he\u2019s actually thinking on a 100-year timescale", "and that\u2019s very confusing", "at east rock, we always say that if you wanna have variant perception, it helps to be variant", "and i remember interviewing mike burry, steve eisman, and all the other somewhat fringe, somewhat variant investors who were shorting subprime mortgages in 2006 and basically all the characters that michael lewis captured so accurately in the big short", "and the housing bubble is obvious in retrospect, but at the time almost everyone thought they were completely smoking dope", "and the current cryptocurrency scene reminds me a lot of the subprime short ecosystem because the opportunity attracts the more variant players who have nothing to lose from disrupting the status quo", "so, on crypto, you\u2019ve got all the libertarians, and the unemployed macro hedge fund managers, and all the kids", "there\u2019s this great quote by one of the characters in tom stoppard\u2019s play, arcadia that the crypto guys like, which is \u201cthe future is disorder", "a door like this has cracked open five or six times since we got up on our hind legs", "it\u2019s the best possible time to be alive when almost everything you thought you knew was wrong.\u201d i think that mentality of saying, \u201cbring it on,\u201d to chaos, that now is the best possible time to be alive, to \u201clearn to love the rain,\u201d as josh waitzkin says is really hard for people who have succeeded in the status quo context", "and so, i think bitcoin could just be a bubble due to qe post the financial crisis, or it could be a change in how we organize human activity at the level of the internet itself, or both", "and i\u2019m, at the moment, trying to hold both perspectives without needing to decide yet", "i\u2019m trying to stay \u2013 i think of it as open-sharing instead of striving for closure", "i\u2019ll finish up the career question with one last quote from the very self-transforming charlie munger, who at 93 has no filters left, and he has more wisdom percentage than almost anyone i read", "he says, \u201ci\u2019ve noticed in a long lifetime that the people who really love you are the people where you scramble together with difficulty, and you\u2019ve jointly gotten through", "and in the end, those people will love you more than somebody who just shared in an even prosperity through the whole thing", "so, this adversity that seems so awful when you\u2019re scrambling through actually is the sinecure of your success, your affection, every other damn thing", "the idea that life is a series of adversities, and each one is an opportunity to behave well instead of badly is a very, very good idea.\u201d and he says, \u201cand it works so well in old age because you get so many adversities you can\u2019t fix", "so, you better have some technique for welcoming those adversities.\u201d hey, guys", "this is tim again", "just a few more things before you take off", "no", "1, this is 5-bullet friday", "do you want to get a short email from me \u2013 would you enjoy getting a short email from me every friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend", "and 5-bullet friday is a very short email where i share the coolest things i\u2019ve found or that i\u2019ve been pondering over the week", "that could include favorite new albums that i\u2019ve discovered", "it could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that i\u2019ve somehow dug up in the world of the esoteric, as i do", "it could include favorite articles that i have read and that i\u2019ve shared with my close friends, for instance", "and it\u2019s very short",
