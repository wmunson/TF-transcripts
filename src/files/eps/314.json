"num_sentences": 1754, "num_words": 22712, "raw_text": "Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Cindy, welcome to the show. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Thanks for having me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I am very excited to dig in. I thought we could start in medias res, as they say in novels where you start right in the middle of the action. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Okay. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, we\u2019re going to bounce all over the place as I always do. JPMorgan Healthcare Conference \u2013 I\u2019ve heard some murmurs about stories and getting attention or people to focus. Could you please describe for folks what happened? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Awesome. So, biggest conference in all of healthcare \u2013 I get invited in. I have eight minutes, do or die. So proud of this opportunity, I get in front of the room. You can imagine. Here\u2019s me in the hot pink, head to toe. I start to talk about women and sex and the whole room starts to giggle. I can feel this giggle going off across the crowd and I\u2019m panicking watching the clock count down. So, I can remember reaching to my laptop, fast-forwarding as fast as I can to a slide that was just brain scan studies, studies of women with this condition versus women without, where in black and white, we could see there is a biological basis to women\u2019s lack of desire for sex. So, I put the slide up. I turned and pointed. Long enough for it to be uncomfortable for everybody, I went silent. When I did that, I said, \u201cAre you looking at what I\u2019m looking at because I\u2019m just here to talk about the biology of sex for women.\u201d It\u2019s an important lesson for me of what I was going to have to do to make people focus. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, you let the silence do the work. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It was uncomfortable. I figured it was long enough for it to be uncomfortable for me, which was a fair trade for them having made me really uncomfortable as they started giggling and wouldn\u2019t pay attention to me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Silence. Yeah. It\u2019s so powerful. It\u2019s so, so powerful. I remember advice I was given at one point \u2013 well, I was given that advice first by someone named Cal Fussman, who\u2019s a master interviewer, when he was going over some transcripts from this podcast in the early days. He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re too fast. You don\u2019t leave gaps. You don\u2019t have to save people. Let the silence do the work.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, I love that story. So, speaking of letting the silence do the work, I\u2019m going to go silent really quick because I want to ask you two questions that might take a few minutes to answer, but I\u2019m going to start with the short one. What is your favorite business and why? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0My favorite business of all is Wegmans, which if anybody is from the Northeast, they appreciate this is a grocery store. How can you get excited about a grocery story? I\u2019m excited because it\u2019s from my birthplace, Rochester, and I went there every Sunday as a little girl. Here\u2019s why I loved it \u2013 because of the incredible loyalty that they instilled. How do you get folks that are cashiers at the checkout line with jobs that may seem relatively unexciting to show up every day with unbridled enthusiasm for what the do? So, it opened years later \u2013 I moved my whole life \u2013 it opened in the DC area. I went the first day that Wegmans opened in DC and I walked up and all of their employees were standing outside holding their hands above their head like a W because they have Wegmans pride, the Wegmans way. I\u2019ve got to tell you, that first day, anybody in the entire DC metro area who had ever been to a Wegmans showed up and stood in line to walk through this store. I love them for being a private, family-held business that has that kind of loyalty and longevity of employees. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do they instill that? I mean, is it filtering for the right employees who are prone to that to begin with? Is it something else? How do they develop that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I think it is oh-so-simple. I think it is their basic appreciation for the people who show up and work for them every day. They reward them through the right incentives, they reward them through the best benefits, they help develop them, they encourage them when they lose weight. There are all of these incentives to their employees to make them truly feel that appreciation from their employer and also, I think, be proud to work there. They go home and have pride in saying who they work for. So, I started studying businesses I loved at a very young age. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I had a conversation with Frank Blake, former CEO of Home Depot right here, sitting where you are. They developed this orange apron cult, as it was sometimes referred to. The dedication that some of these employees showed was incredible. His point was, \u201cOne of the systems I instilled was positive reinforcement by sharing stories on a very regular, scheduled basis of standout customer service.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Incredible. Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I have to tell you, I sold my first business late. I sold it to a group that was private equity-backed. I ran into one of those guys, one of the bankers years later and he said, \u201cThat group you had, they were almost cult-like.\u201d I think he said it with sort of one eyebrow raised, like, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cThank you for that.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the nicest compliment I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You mean in the Apple way, not the David Koresh way? Perfect. I\u2019ll take it. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Exactly. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, the next question, which will seem odd to people listening, but will soon make more sense, is not really a question. I\u2019ll be polite and make it a question. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Okay. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Could you please give me your three-minute commercial? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Okay. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Tell me about yourself, soup to nuts. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Alright. I moved my entire childhood. So, every year from 4th to 12th grade, I was in a different school. So, I was the perpetual new kid. I think what that did was perfect my ability to stand on the outside of the room and look in and really listen, understand motivations, understand the dynamic, which served me well later in life. At the time, I went kicking and screaming. I have a love that started very young in life for what makes businesses great. So, as I went through college, I was fortunate to have a great business professor who really cultivated that in me. So, I\u2019d have to report to her every week what my favorite business was, why, what they were doing differently. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0And along that way, I made a unilateral decision that I was going to go work for Merck. So, she thought I should probably broaden my options. It wasn\u2019t such a slam dunk. I told her, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to work for Merck.\u201d They weren\u2019t hiring when I got out of school, but eight months later, they were, and I got the job. I called her up. I said, \u201cI got that job that you said I might not.\u201d And she said, \u201cGreat. We\u2019re going out to dinner and you\u2019re buying.\u201d So, I went to work for Merck. I started in pharma because it was Fortune\u2019s Most Admired Company. That\u2019s why I went there. I wanted to learn from the best. I thought I would actually take it elsewhere and apply it. I didn\u2019t really think I was going to be so fascinated with the science, fell in love with the science and the innovation, what it could mean in people\u2019s lives. I loved what pharma had the capacity to do, hated how they got it done in the bigger companies. So, I made the leap, went smaller, smaller, and smaller until I ultimately was maybe crazy enough to start it for myself. I built two businesses, both in sexual health. People say, \u201cWhy?\u201d I say, \u201cIrish Catholic, of course.\u201d So, I built a business slate with the only long-acting testosterone for men. That made me on the path of watching this emergent science for women. When this drug was put on the shelf by the company that invented it, I made a decision to sell that off and take it on and got the only ever drug approved for sexual desire in women. I sold that business and now as a pass through, do nothing but spend my time reaching my hand back and trying to get female founders there to my kind of outcomes faster than I got there myself. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That was really good. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0How many minutes? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now, I wasn\u2019t watching the time, but if I had to use my spider sense\u2026 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Your listeners will know. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If I had to use my spider sense, I think that was really, really close. So, I\u2019m very impressed. For people who are wondering, \u201cWhat the hell is Tim doing? This is the oddest interview I\u2019ve ever heard him attempt to give,\u201d it is because why? What do the last two questions have in common? Why did I ask those two questions? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0You asked those two questions because I love to ask those questions of everybody I interview because I think that if you\u2019ll just be quiet and listen, which you heard a little bit from my background, people will tell you a lot about themselves and what their motivations are. So, that was always probably my initial question in interviewing and figuring out from people what they would tell me about themselves. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What would you look for? Were there any particular checkered flags, meaning fantastic, or red flags, meaning, \u201cMaybe not a good person to pick?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0For me, it was discomfort with change, the lack of adaptability because in my environments, they were not the same structure that they might have been coming from. They were going to have to be nimble, have to move quickly to keep pace. I always laid my cards at the table at the end of interviews and said, \u201cHere\u2019s who we are. Here\u2019s this culture. We both should lay our cards on the table because six months from now, I don\u2019t want us to be unhappy with each other.\u201d So, I think I\u2019m always listening for those cues that would indicate a fit for my environment. And in it, I think I was finding the people with a love of businesses. I often ask that question, \u201cWhat is the business that you most admire?\u201d because they\u2019ve got to have that passion. I think particularly in small and startup, you have to have a real love affair with what it is that makes things tick. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What did you study in undergrad? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Business. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Business? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What did your business professor do besides have you report back each week on your favorite business of the week? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I think she just took a special interest. I think she saw something there and cultivated it so that she was pushing me. So, not only did she push me with the assignment that was above and beyond what she was asking of everybody else. But I think she also tortured me a little bit with the doubt to see if I would push through it. When I said to her, \u201cI\u2019m going to go work for Merck,\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Your science grades aren\u2019t that good.\u201d She really pushed back like it wasn\u2019t such a sure thing. So, she was constantly setting the bar for me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, I don\u2019t know if you had a chance to ask her, but did she genuinely think that you would have trouble getting the job or was it a Yoda trick to get you to stubbornly pursue it twice as hard? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0100 percent a stubborn trick. I think she knew that I have sort of a healthy chip on my shoulder of proving it. So, she was definitely pushing right at that button of, \u201cGo out there and prove it.\u201d So, yeah, very clever. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, how does one start a pharma company without a pharma background? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Well, pharma background in that I\u2019d been in the industry for a long time. So, I had the right contacts. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You had the industry experience. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I had the industry experience, yes. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t word that very well \u2013 without the\u2026 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0The scientific background. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s right. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Surround yourself with an extraordinary scientific team. I feel like I\u2019ve learned at the hands of some of the best in science. I think I\u2019ve always brought a lens to it of what would work in the market. We were sort of a magical pairing because many times in science, you can get enamored in the lab with things and not look outside to what\u2019s really going to work in the mainstream. So, it was a lot about having just a great team. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you pick \u2013 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0And I can play a doctor on TV now. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You can? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes, or I at least think I can. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Or via people\u2019s earbuds if they may have them. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah, that\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you end up choosing the \u2013 you said long-acting testosterone. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Testosterone. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, paint a picture of us. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0We can certainly get into testosterone and like HPTA and all this fun stuff. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0But I don\u2019t want to bore some segment of my population of listeners to death, although I am fascinated by it. So, we probably will get into it. How did you end up choosing that? Did it start with finding the opportunity and then, \u201cI want to start a company?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0No. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Or did you decide, \u201cI want to start a company now. Let me try to find a product?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That was it. Yeah. I wanted to start my own company. I felt like I had a hypothesis. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old were you at the time or where were you in time? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I was in my early 30s at the time when I started it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. Got it. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I had one career experience that was very informative. So, I had been at a company that was acquired. They had been gobbled up by somebody who had gobbled up a lot and then they had to integrate them. I got to be on that team. So, I got this put together of the perfect company. That was a great career moment for me. Then I got to go apply it doing my own. The reason I did it is for that same reason. I love pharma for what it can do. At 3:00 a.m. in the morning, if you\u2019re sick, you love pharma. In the light of day, you probably don\u2019t and it\u2019s because it is an industry that has a certain reputation. I thought there was a way to do it better. I had the hypothesis that here I am, driven and succeeding in these environments, but totally uninspired. There have to be other people like me. What if I got them together, gave them permission to do it on my own terms? That was Slate. I named my company Slate on purpose \u2013 clean slate. We were going to do it our way. It was to go out and find a diamond in the rough, an asset that had been overlooked. I love the category. I love sexual medicine. I\u2019m a card-carrying member of the Sexual Medicine Society. Who knew there was that? There is. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, there is? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It makes me popular at cocktail parties. I whip it out. No. There really is a society. It\u2019s because actually, our understanding there has really come much more recently. It\u2019s a relatively new field. Yet, we\u2019re learning such interesting things. It\u2019s in conditions that you might not lose your life from them, but you will lose your life as you know it when you\u2019re affected by these dysfunctions. So, I found this inventor who had the only FDA-approved long-acting testosterone.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do you find someone like that? You would think in a world of pharma discovery that the bones would have been picked clean. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes. Okay. This is a great story. A scientist that I knew from a previous company was quoted in an article. This gentleman reached out to him. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this space, but I know somebody who\u2019s really interested in it.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, the inventor was looking for a way to commercialize? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It was a very fortuitous introduction. I couldn\u2019t believe that this had been overlooked. The reason it had been overlooked is that almost all of this product was being used off-label, meaning that not for its being indication. It was being used, interestingly, in women. So, my journey started very early in this use for libido. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s the compound? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It was testosterone. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What type of testosterone? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It was a pellet. So, it was long-acting, put under the surface of the skin, released testosterone over a four to six-month window. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Wow. Okay.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, here\u2019s me looking at it going, \u201cFirst of all, it should be used by urologists in men.\u201d I did this crossover analyst. Only one urologist in the country was using it. So, I thought this would be a great business to build. Frankly, the delivery system is better than what\u2019s available on the market today if I thought of something that was custom made for men. I have big brothers. I\u2019m used to being around guys. They can be sitting on the beach burning bright red and they still won\u2019t be sunscreen on or rub something on. The most common applications for testosterone at the time were gels. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Gel, right. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, this was like, \u201cHey, can you remember to show up three times a year to the doctor?\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0They\u2019re like, \u201cSure, I can do that.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright. The inventor reaches out to your friend, the scientist, who says, \u201cI can\u2019t help you but maybe my friend can.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s how it starts. So, the pellet \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of, for instance, like Trenbolone, which is used in cattle, in some cases, also popular with some power lifters and so on who do not use it in pellet form. How is it administered or how is it put into the patient? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, it\u2019s put in in an in-office procedure. At the end of it, it requires a band-aid. So, there\u2019s a device, a trocar. You go just under the surface of the skin, set it underneath the skin, put a band-aid on, and\u2026 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Off you go. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. For urologists or surgeons, this in-office procedure was very simple. The great news is it was half the price of anything on the market. So, everybody was winning in this equation. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why was it half the price? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0On purpose for me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Because you set the pricing. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I did, yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Was it less costly because you were comparing it to other modes of administration which require more visits, hence it\u2019s not \u2013 no. It was just the market positioning. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Just the cost of the drug. Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Fascinating. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I have a belief system around that in pharma around drug pricing. So, it was important for me to do that. We were making great money, building a great business, and we were doing just fine at that cost. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right. You don\u2019t need a 500 million-percent markup. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Exactly. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yes. As we may or may not talk about, some people get into a lot of trouble for that. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Rightfully so. Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What other questions do you like to ask when you\u2019re interviewing people? Are there any other questions that you find yield \u2013 or are worth the effort, that are particularly helpful or other approaches to hiring? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I\u2019m going to go back to silence. I\u2019m going to go back to \u2013 I do more listening than asking. I ask the one open-ended question and try to see where they\u2019ll take me. I think I\u2019m getting a lot of insights into who they are by doing that. I don\u2019t think there are magical questions. I think there are ways to tease out cultural fit. That is so important. I care much less about the resume. Everybody wants to come in and impress you. They haven\u2019t really hit your doorstep unless they have the cred, I think, to be in there interviewing for the position. So, I feel like it\u2019s my job to really tease out that cultural fit so that we\u2019re both happy with each other. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, culture can mean a lot of things to different people. In this particular case \u2013 you mentioned the adaptability, which in a small startup, especially, you\u2019re going to be wearing a lot of hats and those hats may change. So, you need someone who\u2019s adaptable. What else were you looking for and what did they mean to you? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Six things. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Good. There we go. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Mine are pretty specific. Let me say \u2013 overarching, I\u2019m looking for people who wake up every day and make deliberate choices. It\u2019s all a choice how you go through life. My six were they had to choose to be an owner. They had to be highly motivated by that ownership. They had to choose to be bold. We were going to make decisions a little differently. They had to choose to be quirky because I needed them to feel that permission to be individual in my environment. Most of them were coming out of environments in which we beat sameness into people and homogenize the whole group. They had to choose to be learning. That\u2019s fundamental to me even as I invest today. It\u2019s so important to watch what people do to learn every day. They had to choose to be family because we were going to be a small, tight-knit group. And they had to choose to be appreciative. I think that is how you go through life. What is your attitude? Do you marvel at the opportunity you have to make impact? So, those were my six choices I was looking for. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do you avoid false positives in the sense that if you say to them, \u201cThese are the six values\u2026?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Oh, I never, never \u2013 you\u2019re listening to the story that, I think, exposes those values. But if you ask somebody that, like, \u201cDo you choose to be quirky?\u201d \u201cUh, sure.\u201d You\u2019re not going to get, I think, the right response. I think you have to know your core of who you are and who fits. Then I think you have to ask the questions. I will say there is one other question I do always ask. I ask, \u201cHow is the very first way you ever made money?\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I like that. That\u2019s a really good one. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0If they can\u2019t tell me, \u201cI put flyers in the mailboxes in the neighborhood and said, \u2018Odd jobs, call me,\u2019\u201d or if they are like, \u201cWell, my first job out of college was\u2026\u201d They\u2019re out. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They don\u2019t have that sort of mentality that\u2019s going to fit. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0One of my friends, Brian Johnson, who has done a whole host of very impressive things, he was the founder \u2013 I don\u2019t think he had a cofounder \u2013 but let\u2019s just say one of the founders, to be safe, of Braintree, which then sold for a whole lot of money. When entrepreneurs come to him, because he invests quite a lot now, and they say they want to start something, he\u2019ll ask them, \u201cIs that an itch or is it a burn?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s cool. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Then he\u2019ll take them down that discussion to assess, \u201cDo you really have the stick-to-itiveness and the stubbornness and just the, \u2018It can\u2019t be any other way with me,\u2019 to actually make it through this?\u201d Because it\u2019s not going to be all roses and kittens and sunshine. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Can I tell you a quirky story? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You can absolutely tell me a quirky story. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0This is how it went in an interview. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0After you tell me one quirky story, I would like you to tell me a bold story from your personal experience. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Perfect. Okay. Here is my quirky \u2013 if I had asked for this, it wouldn\u2019t have come out. But I am in an interview with a young woman who wants to come sell for me this testosterone product. Her brother had a particular genetic condition that meant that he didn\u2019t go through puberty normally. So, they have to have testosterone replacement from a very young age. Nobody was more passionate about our product. She had witnessed what it did for his life, what it did for her family, but she\u2019d never sold. So, I was taking a big chance. Look, young, no sales experience, going to be walking into urology offices having a pretty sensitive conversation about men\u2019s sexual health and I\u2019m in the interview with her and I\u2019m going, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just kind of worried about\u2026\u201d And I didn\u2019t so much as get it out as she looked at me and she said, \u201cBalls.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d So, there was no doubt of recognition from me that this girl was quirky, that she was not going to have fear in the office. Maybe that\u2019s bold. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s bold or quirky. I\u2019m going to call it both Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I think it\u2019s both. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It ultimately became her nickname in the office. We called her Duck Balls. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Duck balls? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah, because we had a whole other duck story. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Wait, I\u2019ll take the bait \u2013 what\u2019s the duck? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0We called her Ducky because she was always very calm on the surface, but like going like this a million miles an hour underneath. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. We\u2019re going to come back to the bold story. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah, that\u2019s fair. TIm Ferriss:\u00a0First, I should just, as a public service announcement, say to those people out there who do not have common sense \u2013 don\u2019t just jump up and shout, \u201cBalls,\u201d in every job interview because you think that\u2019s going to show how bold you are. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Fair enough. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And if you do and you don\u2019t get hired, shame on you. In the course of doing some research, I believe \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m making this up \u2013 but you give everybody nicknames or a lot of your employees nicknames. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I do. Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why is that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It is my quirk. I\u2019ve had it my whole life. I know my mother by so many different names that I think people don\u2019t know who I\u2019m referring to half of the time that have known us for years. I did it because we love to story tell. We sit around the lunch table. We have a discipline of having lunch together every single day. That was an effort to \u2013 you know, no death by meeting. How would we all be on the same page and still create this family spirit? People get to telling stories and of course, it\u2019s the one you wish you hadn\u2019t told that ultimately arrives at your nickname. But the beauty of that is we have a whole ceremony \u2013 a caricature, you get a nickname. It\u2019s basically handed over at the lunch table. You will never me known by your real name again. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Wait a second \u2013 so, this is like the knighting by nickname. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It is. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0At what point does this happen? Is it like your first week on the job? Is it like, \u201cOn Friday, you\u2019re going to be\u2026?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0No. We need a little more time than that, but probably a month in, it happens. The caricature goes on the wall. Your name is sort of never to be heard again other than your nickname. The reason I did it \u2013 it was important to me that I was giving permission in my environments \u2013 permission to be yourself, to show who that was. Especially when you\u2019re building companies where a lot of your people are outside of the main office or salespeople or other, it was a way for us to get to know one another. It felt like, \u201cOh, I get it. I know who you are. I\u2019ve heard your story.\u201d I think it created this culture of locked arms, us against the world. We knew each other\u2019s quirks. So, yeah, weird habit, but one that stays to today. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright. If I may \u2013 this is going to lead somewhere, but I\u2019m a little sleep-deprived and on lots of caffeine. So, I\u2019m just going to roll with it. So, a friend of mine told me a joke recently. I\u2019m not going to give the whole joke because it\u2019s kind of long, but this tourist goes to Scotland. He\u2019s sitting in a bar. He\u2019s hanging out. There\u2019s this old guy in the corner. He starts like yelling at this tourist every couple of minutes. He\u2019d be like, \u201cHey, laddie, you see that pier out there? I built it with me own hands. What do they call me? Scotty the Pier Builder? No.\u201d He keeps doing this. This guy\u2019s like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He goes on and on and on. He goes, \u201cBut laddie, I fuck one goat and what do they call me?\u201d So, the point being do people have the ability to veto their nickname? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely not. Who gets to request their own nickname? That never works. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s true. That\u2019s not going to work. Just to give examples, you have Duck Balls. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I do.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What are some other examples? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I have a guy named Spoon, which was born out of a story of this incredible bromance between him and another guy. They\u2019re still great friends to this day. They so loved each other in their sales training that we said that all that was missing was them spooning. But I\u2019ll give an example of how that story and that nickname stuck with the whole group. Actually, this guy got cancer, one of my reps, and a pretty dismal diagnosis. It was one of the other reps who came forward and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a virtual Get Well Spoon card.\u201d So, every single person in the company had the spoon hanging on the end of their nose and sent it out. It was their kids and it was their dogs and it was their family. I think that it didn\u2019t come from me. That came from somebody else in the organization. That\u2019s how as much as we teased him about it, in that really important moment, he knew we were all looking out for him. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, this makes me think of a few things. \u00a0I really would love your thoughts on, of course, everything I\u2019m asking you, otherwise why would I ask you in the first place? But this type of joking around, I think, is a really, from what I\u2019ve seen, a really critical ingredient in almost any tight-knit group that does big things. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019ve also spoken with a controversial guy for a bunch of reasons, but Jim Watson, co-discoverer of the double helix. That story is also a little more complicated than we have time for right now. He talked about how these small groups \u2013 my words, not his, but like dick and fart jokes are actually really important for like letting the air out of the tires and to facilitate the endurance that people are going to need to get through the emotional hurdles. So, my question is like Duck Balls, clearly not the most politically correct nickname, right? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0 Fair. Yes. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0But that\u2019s kind of why it works, right? So, my question is in today\u2019s times where, yes, there are horrible things that do happen in offices and terrible misbehavior at the same time, this type of nicknaming and so on, I think, is really helpful. So, how do you \u2013 what would your advice be to people that are like, \u201cYeah, I want that, we need that,\u201d but they\u2019re afraid? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Well, look, I think you know \u2013 it\u2019s that laying my cards on the table. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0When you first came in an interview with me, \u201cHere\u2019s who we are.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll hate us in six months if you don\u2019t like this, this, and this.\u201d I think that transparency from me of who we were and what the environment was like \u2013 and look, we never were offensive. There was such an underlying affection for one another. But it gave us permission to have what I\u2019ll call constructive irreverence. Irreverence with me too \u2013 they gave me a nickname. We knew that we could have that comfortably inside of our environment and all be on the same page when we walked out into the world. I think it\u2019s really important. I think that not taking yourself to seriously, I think being self-deprecating \u2013 when I talk to a lot of female founders who are very frustrated by the injustices and this or that, I say, \u201cThe best piece of advice I could have for you is perfect your sense of humor along the way,\u201d because when it is something that is offensive, the best way for you to cut through that is with humor. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, for sure. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It is the best way. Actually, the person on the other side might take a step back and think, \u201cOh god, did I just do that?\u201d But you\u2019ve given them room to sort of ask for forgiveness in that. I think humor is really important. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. It also gives \u2013 this is having spent a lot of time in Japan and China also, where in China, [inaudible] [00:29:58] is like to lose face. You\u2019re giving someone the chance to also kind of recover form a stumble instead of creating what could be a really longstanding, kind of awkwardness intention. Do you have a nickname? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I do. It\u2019s HBIC. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Were you allowed to come up with your own nickname? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely not. They tell me that the B stands for Betty, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re lying. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What does the whole thing stand for. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Head Betty in Charge. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Who gave you that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0There\u2019s always a secret nicknaming committee. It\u2019s never revealed. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I see. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It just came to the table one day. It was written on my caricature. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m just going all over the place, but that\u2019s what I do. You mentioned new sales rep, Balls, and then henceforth, you will forever be known as Duck Balls. We\u2019re not going to keep going on Duck Balls. I just like saying it. That\u2019s six or seven. But the sales position is a really important position. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Really important position. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s like everything is a whole lot of talk until something gets sold, ultimately, right? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you train? What were some of the techniques that worked really well for either of your products for selling? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. I think that the best approach was that I gave them permission to fire the D-list. In sales, particularly in pharma sales, you get on this like, \u201cEvery two weeks, this is my routing. I\u2019m going to go out \u2013 reach and frequency, reach and frequency.\u201d I think that it says to keep chasing your tail in situations in which you\u2019re never going to pull it through. So, it\u2019s rare, I think, to say to a salesperson, \u201cYou know what? Scope it out. Move on. Fire them. Wait until they call you back and they\u2019re looking for the product and really focus your energy on those who are raising their hand quickly.\u201d So, I think that was different, at least in my industry. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s counterintuitive at all to selling, but it certainly is in the traditional pharma approach. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How is first contact made? Is it walk in the door, brush the feet on the carpet, \u201cI\u2019m here to see Dr. So-and-So?\u201d Or is it an email? What does the first contact look like with a prospect? Who is the prospect? What\u2019s the right approach? What\u2019s the right pitch? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Hit the front line of the office and you\u2019re actually dealing with the receptionist that you need to talk to to see the physician, the nurse, etc. So, you\u2019re going through all of those different steps to get to them. Our group was helping in an in-office procedure. I think they were highly valued for what they could do in the office. They walked in in scrubs. It was different. They sort of walked right to the back of the room. So, I think that it was them knowing that they\u2019re bringing something of value. I think in sales, you can feel like the one that is the pain in the ass, that people are saying, \u201cYou, go, you\u2019re just taking time in my day.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I think they had enough confidence in what they were bringing that they didn\u2019t accept that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right. It wasn\u2019t \u201cDeath of a Salesman.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It wasn\u2019t. Exactly. With that product, we had this incredible opportunity. So, what happens today? You get a drug. You get it filled at a pharmacy. You probably have no idea who the drug manufacturer is. With that product, because it was done in office, we had this incredible opportunity to own that relationship with the physician. So, I looked around and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, who in pharma does well with customer service? Oh, nobody. Okay. So, what are we going to do?\u201d I took my entire leadership team to Zappos and we learned from them. We were constantly looking outside of our industry for who was doing it great. So, here\u2019s a story. Our most important guide, sort of the top researcher in the country is from Harvard. He did a lot of the early days testosterone research. He did that research on lizards. When he would buy our product, we\u2019d put a plastic lizard in his box, wouldn\u2019t say anything, just drop one in his box. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0We were trying to see what would happen. I went to visit him several months later. I walk in \u2013 can\u2019t get more ivory tower. I\u2019m in Harvard. He\u2019s got this beautiful mahogany bookcase \u2013 second shelf, all of our lizards. It made a difference. It was that quirky \u2013 so, I think our salespeople were always \u2013just like we listened to each other for what our stories were, they really listened closely and celebrated that in the customer. Not what you\u2019d you think from a pharma company, huh? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No, it\u2019s not. What other companies did you borrow from or look at? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Wow. Big and small \u2013 I think that all of the people who worked for me were students of great businesses. They mimicked that behavior that my business professor probably taught me. At one time, we went to Seattle. I love Seattle. I used to live there. We went to the Pike Place Market, spent an hour, just went out and learned from those businesses. We were learning from Beecher\u2019s, the cheese shop. What do they do exceptionally well? How do they invite people into the experience? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, Zappos was probably our most formal \u2013 go together, learn from them. But constantly reading or picking those businesses that we loved, that was a constant conversation at the lunch table. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If you were \u2013 this could be, let\u2019s just say freshman year of high school, freshman year of college \u2013 teaching an entrepreneurship class, but the only way you could teach it is by recommending books and exercises or practices, are there any particular books that come to mind that you would insist they read or any particular practices or exercises that you would have people do? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I would insist that they read \u201cPurple Cow.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cPurple Cow?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Mr. Godin. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Right? Yeah. I would insist that they read it about how you stand out in a sea of sameness. That\u2019s it. I think in terms of sales, for sure, or for entrepreneurship, how do you stand out? What is going to be your defining difference and how do you sort of attract remarkable to you if you\u2019re doing something truly remarkable? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one-size-fits-all. That would be my ask. I think that I would tell every entrepreneur go sell something. If they\u2019ve never sold anything, go learn from somebody. Go be in their sales organization and then take it back to your company. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, there\u2019s a fellow Austinite here named Noah Kagan who recommends \u2013 one of his exercises that he suggests to everybody is the coffee challenge. The coffee challenge is just getting more comfortable with discomfort by for the next, say, week, every day, you have to go into a coffee shop \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Starbucks, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s mom and pop \u2013 and asking for 10 percent off your coffee when you get to the checkout. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I love that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0He\u2019s the first one to say the outcome does not matter. You just have to ask. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Okay. I love that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You can\u2019t say you\u2019re doing an experiment. You can\u2019t make them more comfortable with it. You just have to ask for a discount. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Thank you, Noah. I\u2019m going to be applying that now. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s really valuable. I was trading texts with a friend of mine, younger guy, who is developing his own product and he\u2019s working on the product in a startup, but it\u2019s not at a point where he\u2019s interacted with any customers yet. I mentioned this to him and he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t need that because I make myself uncomfortable in all of these following ways.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just do it? Send me a photograph of the receipt, whether you get a discount or not.\u201d He\u2019s young enough that we have somewhat of a mentor/mentee relationship. He\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, prove it to me. If you don\u2019t need to do it, you\u2019re going to get coffee or tea or water. It doesn\u2019t matter. Buy something. Ask for it. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0He\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll do it just to make you happy.\u201d He sends me a text a few days later. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh my god, I had to walk around the block psyching myself up to do this. My palms were sweating.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Really? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cAnd I got 10 percent off, but it was so much harder \u2013 it brought up all of these emotions I didn\u2019t expect to come up.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s awesome. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You think it\u2019s going to be easy. Let\u2019s confirm.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0 I love it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0This segues nicely to what I promised I would come back to, which is boldness. What are some events or inflection points for you, maybe \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 but any stories of you choosing boldness? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Well, I\u2019ll tell you probably my boldest choice was when I made a decision to dispute the FDA. I was on this course \u2013 it\u2019s pretty straightforward. You have a pre-specified endpoint. You go out and do the studies. You meet them with statistical significance. You get to an approval, provided there are no show-stoppers. So, I had gone out. I\u2019d gotten this drug from the company that first developed it. I had sat down with the FDA, \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d We had agreed. I had gone out. I had done the work. I had gotten the outcomes. We got rejected. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What was the drug? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0This was Addyi. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0A-D-D-Y-I. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, at that moment, it was crippling for my business. We had done the work. We had done all the right things scientifically and yet we got to a no. I was faced with turning back to shareholders and saying, \u201cThis is going to be this many million more dollars.\u201d At that time, I was lucky. A woman reached out to me. People knew we were on this journey. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Just for context for people listening, this is your second company. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It is, Sprout Pharmaceuticals. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Dubbed by the media, the product, at least, as female Viagra, just for people who are trying to keep track. Okay. Please continue. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, people knew that we were going down this path. I think that it was so fortuitous that she reached out to me at this moment and said, \u201cDon\u2019t give up. I was on the drug in the research trials. I want to share my story with you.\u201d She lived outside of DC. I was in DC all the time.\u00a0 I went to have a coffee with her. She walked into the room and this woman was in charge \u2013 type A, recognized her right away. She walked over. She had her own business. She had raised two beautiful boys. She had what looked like the perfect marriage by all of our normal standards. She said, \u201cI have succeeded in every aspect of my life other than this. I\u2019m waiting every day for my husband to ask me for a divorce.\u201d And I\u2019m looking at this woman and I thought \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Because of their sex life or lack thereof? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. She had no interest. She had been diagnosed with this condition. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is the condition? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It\u2019s called hypoactive sexual desire disorder. HSDD is the moniker. Same prevalence as ED has for men \u2013 so, ED is the most common male sexual dysfunction. HSDD is women\u2019s most common. It\u2019s a lack of interest in having sex. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Physiologically, how does that manifest? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, in order to respond to sexual stimuli, you need the right balance of key chemicals in the brain. Your excitement factors and your inhibition factors need to come into play. For some subset of women, they go out of whack. They become imbalanced. It\u2019s how Addyi works. It works on the restoration of those key chemicals. And we know it from these brain scan studies. So, a woman who has this condition with the normal ebb and flow of desire for sex, put them in an MRI, show them sexual cues, their brains light up, actually, totally differently. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What are the chemicals? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0 Dopamine and serotonin. So, our excitatory factors have a transient negative effect on serotonin, which is an inhibitor for your sexual response. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Say that one more time? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Serotonin. So, dopamine is positive, excitement for sex. Serotonin is inhibition. The drug worked by this transient negative effect. So, a negative effect on a negative for sex equaled a pro-sexual effect. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Got it. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m just trying to think. Okay. So, it would be\u2026 Got it. So, serotonin has an inhibitory effect. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0What do we know of the antidepressants? Their most common side effect is actually killing your sex drive. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, interestingly, as drugs are often discovered, this drug was looked at for its effect on depression. What you do when you\u2019re testing those drugs is you actually have to administer a scale to see, \u201cHow much am I killing their sex drive?\u201d In this particular drug\u2019s case, it all went the other direction. It had a pro-sexual effect. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, wow. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, at that time, all of the study changed to look at this condition, specifically. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I don\u2019t know if this is due to the tracking. There\u2019s some maybe folklore in this genesis story, but Viagra, same story. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah, same. Absolutely. Blood pressure medication, low and behold, a very interesting side effect. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So the folklore goes \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true \u2013 but the male subject would not give the medication back. They\u2019re like, \u201cHey, this doesn\u2019t work for blood pressure. Give us our supplies back.\u201d They were like, \u201cNo, we want to keep them.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Very interestingly, when I got to Addyi, I had built this great company for men. I was in this community. The company that innovated this drug originally was going to put it on the shelf. They were going to walk away from it. One of the great researchers in the field went out to women who w ere in the trials and said, \u201cI need you to come in and bring your medication with you. We\u2019re going to have a normal meeting.\u201d He was actually delivering the news that they were killing it, that they were killing the development trial. He filmed it and the women were like this, giving their drug back \u2013 hands shaking, crying. He said, \u201cYou need to do something about this.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Two questions \u2013 why were they going to shelf it? When you say got the drug \u2013 there\u2019s a good amount of discussion and deal making that goes into that. How does one get a drug? If you don\u2019t mind discussing it, what does a typical deal structure look like for something like that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Mine was very atypical. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, then let\u2019s talk about both typical and atypical. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Okay, happy. First, let me tell you just about how we got the drug. Lucky for me, I think I built a reputation in this field that the key researchers in it knew that I cared deeply about women having access to medicine. At the time, there were 26 FDA-approved drugs for some form of male sexual dysfunction and not a single one for women. You asked why that company would put it on the shelf. It was very clear to me that it wasn\u2019t on the basis of science. Actually, the scientific understanding is spectacular. We\u2019ve come a long way recently in terms of this understanding. It was on the basis of the societal narrative. Boy, if you say women and sex, people have an opinion. It\u2019s not like developing a diabetes medication. Unless you\u2019re diabetic, you probably don\u2019t care. Develop something for sex, we all have a point of view. I think that it was a conservative company. They said, \u201cWe\u2019re not getting into this. We\u2019re not going to get into this entire discussion.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. So, was it a larger company developing multiple drugs? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Large German. I like to tease. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s sex. We\u2019re German. We\u2019re out.\u201d That helps actually promote the understanding. But you have to appreciate cultures inside of companies, certain categories that they\u2019re in. This would have been paving a new frontier for them. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you find this? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I was watching all of this research being presented at the scientific meetings I went to at the Sexual Medicine Society meetings and really just cheering it on from the sidelines as a woman, like, \u201cFinally, we\u2019re going to have one for women.\u201d Then they walked away. I watched a clinical community go from all of this excitement to this true sadness in delivering this message to women. So, I spent a year just listening to women. After I did that, I sold off my company for men and took this on. But when I did that, I went to this company. I think it was with thanks to the fact that the clinical community, the experts in the field were so supportive of me that they gave me the shot. So, they gave me the drug. I didn\u2019t pay for it upfront. They won. I win, they win. They had a royalty in the case that I finally got it to market and in a success scenario. But it was a bold move for them. They\u2019d never done a deal like this before. I think they bet on me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you convince them? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I don\u2019t know that I convinced them as much as those who had watched me build Slate and saw who I was and what I really cared about. I really cared about women having access to this. Women with a medical condition deserved access to a medical treatment, not any of our value judgements on whether or not they needed it or the worthiness of treatment, but just purely the science had spoken and we needed to listen. I think they knew that was my definition of success. I wasn\u2019t in this to create the next blockbuster drug. I was in it to make sure to make sure that women had access. Then they got to choose for themselves. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Did you first deliver that message via email, in person? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0In person. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you get them in person for it, a conference? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Again, thankfully, this kind of key researcher reached out to them and said, \u201cYou need to meet with her.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0\u201cI think she can get this done.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Got it. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0 He wanted me to get it done, I think, for women. He was, by the way, the principal investigator on the Viagra trials. So, he got Viagra approved for men. He would have to tell this story, but in my mind, the story goes he did that and he was like, \u201cOkay, fixed, guys, moving on to women.\u201d He\u2019s actually spent almost all of his years since then just working on women and researching. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No kidding. What\u2019s his name? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Dr. Irwin Goldstein. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Irwin Goldstein. Good for Dr. Goldstein. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I know. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If you don\u2019t mind me asking, if we can\u2019t get into the particulars, it\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m just so fascinated by this stuff \u2013 in publishing, for instance, books, my world, typical royalties would range from, say, 12 to 15 percent for a hardcover. Keeping in mind we\u2019re talking about books. So, the margins are very different, I\u2019m sure. Then there are fairly typical advance ranges for certain types of books, advance on royalties than there are typical royalty rates. There\u2019s very little deviation in the traditional deals, which are still very, very common and certainly predominant. What does that look like in pharma, broadly speaking? We don\u2019t have to talk about your deals, necessarily. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Pharma typically, if you had this type of discovery, you would go out and shop it. If you as an organization decided, \u201cNot a fit, not a fit in our key areas of focus,\u201d or whatever, you\u2019d put it out there to auction, people would bid. They would be buying it on the basis or sort of a projected ultimate kind of peak sales. So, ours was so different I don\u2019t think the royalties look all too different than as you describe, but it was really a very unusual deal. Usually, you\u2019re buying it for a healthy upfront that is anticipating peak sales. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Got it. Is that an advance on royalties, just like books, where you\u2019re getting pre-paid for the anticipated sales? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s making a big bet. That\u2019s somebody coming in and betting on that future for it. So, I buy it. You go away. It\u2019s mine now to further the development. So, we had interesting \u2013 I can\u2019t say it was a partnership. They just ultimately got a check if I was successful. Maybe I even surprised them. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you get it through the FDA? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Well, I was talking about that moment of boldness of the rejection and that decision to fight them. I was fighting them because I had 11,000 women worth of data. That\u2019s why I was fighting them. I knew that the science had spoken. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s also a large sample size compared to, I\u2019m sure, a lot of the other 26. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Extraordinary. So, we\u2019re talking in the 700 to 800 patient range, vis-\u00e0-vis ours.\u00a0 Viagra were big trials, 4,000, but we were several factors higher than that and a very different path. So, I think ultimately, I won on the science. But what had to happen is we had to listen to women. I think in categories where we have natural unconscious bias \u2013 we\u2019ll call it unconscious \u2013 conscious-unconscious bias, you really do have to spend time with the people who are affected by it. So, even if you look at things like AIDS, it took the patient voice for us to really appreciate what needed to happen. Our job as a drug company is to characterize the benefits and the risks with great rigor in trials. Ultimately, the FDA\u2019s job is to protect patient safety if there is a show-stopper in there. But otherwise, it is to turn that decision over to patients and the providers. Because of, again, I think all of the feelings we have about sex, I was told all the time \u2013 I said this earlier \u2013 \u201cCindy, why are you such a crusader in this? Nobody\u2019s going to lose their life from this.\u201d What I said is, \u201cGo spend time with these women. They\u2019re losing their life as they know it.\u201d It\u2019s breaking up their marriages. It\u2019s affecting how they feel about themselves. Our sex is a lot of how we show up in the world, our moxie. If it breaks down in the bedroom, it is breaking down over the breakfast table. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, absolutely. I might be butchering this, but I\u2019ve read you quoted as saying something along the lines of in sexual dysfunction in males, we assume it\u2019s biological and in sexual dysfunction in women, we assume it\u2019s psychological, or not we but most people. Not we, but most people. You certainly don\u2019t, but many people in society do. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0In society at large, for sure, we absolutely do. We sort of pat them on the shoulder. When is at with this woman outside of DC and she told me she succeeded in every aspect of her life other than this, I saw the portrait of a woman who turned on herself, like, \u201cOh, if only I bought sexier lingerie, if only I read \u201950 Shades of Grey.\u2019\u201d When I saw that, I said to her, \u201cHey, mind if I show you something?\u201d I popped open by MacBook, I started showing her, geeking out showing these brain scans. I turned to her and she\u2019s crying. I thought, \u201cThis is why I\u2019m going to do it. It\u2019s the validation that this is real. It\u2019s not just in her head.\u201d That really was a defining moment for when I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fight the FDA.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, tactically speaking, now you have the motivation. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. How do you do it? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do you do? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It is, actually, a path available to drug manufacturers. I like to call it the road less traveled to take them on. But it was a path in which to their credit, what happened was a lot of public conversation. So, they opened their doors. They invited in women who have the condition. They asked them a number of questions so they could have a better understanding for impact, for how they would define success. Then ultimately, they asked us to do additional work along the way and they assembled a body of scientific experts to vote yes or no. It\u2019s an incredible process. So, talk about the nerves in the room. I went in this day. It was a panel of 24. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Is there a name for this alternative path? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It\u2019s a dispute resolution path. Then there\u2019s something called an advisory committee, which is the FDA can go out, assemble experts. You almost go on trial. They read all of your data. They get to ask you, the company, questions. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They get to ask the FDA questions. Then the public gets to speak at the microphone. On that day, by the press of a button they vote. Would they approve it or not based on everything? I remember looking at the screen and my hand shaking with my phone and they overwhelmingly voted to approve it. Again, science won. It had always given us the answer, but we just had to listen to women to, I think, listen to what the data was telling us. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What were their objections with the initial rocky territory that you then had to overcome via the dispute resolution? You don\u2019t have to get into it. I\u2019m just curious. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I think it was just additional study, additional study. We are very protective of women in the process. I think what we have to be careful of is that we don\u2019t become paternalistic in terms of being so protective of women that we are not allowing them to have choice. Here\u2019s why I say it. 26 times we had looked at data sets for men that had benefits and risks \u2013 make no mistake, all drugs had benefits and risks. And we had said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And we turned over the decision to the guy and his provider. We were being protective to the point of not just characterizing those benefits and those risks, giving women that information and letting them make the decision for themselves. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, part of the reason that I\u2019m asking, we definitely don\u2019t need to get into this right now. Even though it\u2019s called the Tim Ferriss show, it\u2019s not me being interviewed, so I\u2019ll try not to be long-winded. Part of the reason I\u2019m so fascinated by this is I am in the process of doing my best to help get both MDMA and [inaudible] [00:54:40] through phase II trials. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Very much top of mind to me. Fortunately, MDMA was recently designated or received breakthrough therapy designation. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Awesome. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Which is fantastic. The results with PTSD are truly astonishing. The magnitude of effect is just so incredible. It\u2019s like 22 percent efficacy psychotherapy alone, 72 percent efficacy \u2013 of course, you have to look at how that\u2019s measured, but with the aid of just a handful of sessions. In any case, that\u2019s part of the reason why I\u2019m digging so much. It\u2019s very much of great interest. Okay. Where to go next? So, you\u2019ve sold two companies, at least. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes, I have. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0To an entrepreneur who is someday thinking of selling a company or in the midst of maybe on the cusp of trying to sell a company, what advice would you give them? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0The first is be prepared that if you sell it, it is both exhilarating and excruciating. I think you don\u2019t anticipate that. It\u2019s the, \u201cIsn\u2019t there the billion-dollar happy ending?\u201d I think you lose a big piece of who you are in that moment and that\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to wrestle with. So, that\u2019s in a success scenario. But as you prepare for it, I think only do it if you believe it makes good on the mission that you hold dear. Have a real sense of, \u201cThis is my baby,\u201d but in the hands of an adoptive parent, it\u2019s going to go to the next level. When you do that deal, make sure you have safeguards that they really will raise that child you want them to. I\u2019ll tell you a lesson learned for me. I sold my first company. Typically, when you sell a company, it\u2019s structured transaction. You get an upfront payment and then hopefully, you participate in the success down the road. Certainly, that\u2019s good for your shareholders. The first time I sold, it was a best efforts clause. Best efforts can hide a multitude of sins. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Describe a best efforts clause. This is really important. So, everybody should listen very, very closely. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0If you\u2019re going to participate together downstream, you don\u2019t want somebody to say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to make my best effort to have this work.\u201d You better have some definition around that. I did that the first time and I had pain when they were deprioritizing it, when they didn\u2019t have enough sales people on the product. So, lesson learned. When I went in to selling sprout, I had real rigor around the definition of performance obligations \u2013 you will have this many salespeople, you will spend this much money on marketing, you\u2019ll make this commitment in terms of disease state education. What that ultimately meant for me is the opportunity when they didn\u2019t do it to get the product back. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. We\u2019ll definitely get to that. This best efforts is really important. I want to just emphasize it. It\u2019s certainly been said that the man and woman who acts as their own lawyer has an idiot for a client, something like that. So, unless you\u2019re trained as a lawyer, get proper legal advice, please. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely. On that point, don\u2019t worry as much about the bank. People are always saying, \u201cWho did you use? What is the bank?\u201d Worry about your transaction attorneys because of how you write these contracts. In any structured transaction, they are your most important asset. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Absolutely. This is important in so many different types of contracts, whether, for instance, I\u2019ve run into this quite a lot in many of my contracts \u2013 publishing, television. If you are a product developer or inventor and you want to license something for a royalty, you only get a percentage of what is sold and what happens if they decide it\u2019s not a priority? Do you have an out? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Well, how scary is it to think that somebody might take it on and kill it? Competitors wanting to own the market \u2013 often, you\u2019re bought by somebody who has products in the category. What if they\u2019re buying you and they\u2019re going to kill your product? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Absolutely. Or doing a fishing expedition to determine how they can kills you or steal your employees \u2013 super common. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, you talked about the second company. What are some other pieces of advice for people thinking of selling a company or in the process of selling a company? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0 I was selling it early. So, from that point, at least in my case, it was actually having the full plan to go it alone. I couldn\u2019t count on, \u201cHey, this really needs to be in the hand of somebody who could march it across the globe.\u201d I needed the plan of going it alone if they never showed up. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do you mean by that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Meaning I had the plan to launch it myself, the ability to hire. I was capitalized to do all of those things, like never go into a negotiation running out of money in the bank because you think you\u2019re going to sell this grand idea that could be realized in the hands of somebody bigger than you. I think that\u2019s a huge mistake. I watch a lot of people do that thinking they\u2019re going to sell it then. In fact, if you want to command the highest price, you better have that ability to say, \u201cBye. I\u2019m doing it myself. See you. I know you want it. I\u2019m going to do it myself.\u201d I think people sometimes mess that piece up. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, for sure. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They go in on skids. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. If you don\u2019t have alternatives, it does not matter how great a wordsmith you are with your negotiating. If the other side knows that you are shit out of luck, you are fucked. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Could you pull some Jedi mind trick? Yeah, maybe. I was given advice a long time ago because I\u2019ve just negotiated so many types of deals. I\u2019ll come back to why that doesn\u2019t actually conflict with lawyer advice that I just gave. But the piece of advice that comes to mind that I was given at one point was this expert, master negotiator, done a lot of business development and bought and sold companies, just dozens and dozens of times, he said to me, \u201cHe who cares the least wins.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Absolutely. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s like the person who has like, \u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely. That\u2019s true. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I think some advice that I remember in the fundraising world, which is slightly different \u2013 but actually, we should talk about fundraising too \u2013 it was, \u201cIf you want money, ask for advice. If you want advice, ask for money.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Actually, the reason I said, just for people listening, that the negotiating deals does not conflict with the get a good lawyer is that \u2013 I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this, but lawyers are really, really critically important. I work with a ton of lawyers for a ton of different things. However, you have to recognize, like really study the incentives and how lawyers are rewarded and how they are punished. If you want to be very business-forward and not play defense, it is often times very, very helpful and certainly cheaper to spec out the basic terms of engagement and maybe along the lines \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be a letter of intent \u2013 but have the basic range of what numbers could look like so that you can disqualify a deal before you pay lawyers to put 20 hours in at $1,500.00 an hour. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0No question. I totally agree with that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, the second company, Sprout \u2013 hurrah, hurrah, you get the FDA approval. Before I get to my real question, I\u2019ll give a real question, which I guess I just smaller \u2013 what did you guys do to celebrate? Did you do anything to celebrate? How did you feel? Button, button, button, button, holy shit. In that moment, when you first realized what had happened, how did you feel? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, I have to tell you, it wasn\u2019t at the moment of sale. It was the moment we won that advisory committee. What we did was \u2013 my team, they were blood, sweat, and tears true to the cause. They prepared so hard for this day. I actually threw a victory party the night before. I can remember the chairman of my board came up and said, \u201cWow, Cindy.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Hold on a second \u2013 the night before you got the news on the advisory committee? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Oh, yeah, because I thought \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Because you were waiting \u2013 you were like, \u201cAlright, we\u2019re going to get the results tomorrow?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes. I thought, \u201cWin or lose, we will have given this all. We will have taken it to the mat.\u201d I needed the team to go in with that. They had won the night before, before we ever got to the outcome. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s really smart. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I can remember the chairman of my board came over and he said \u2013 he\u2019s a Brit \u2013 like, \u201cCindy, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen this before, but I\u2019m questioning this one right now, but I\u2019m going to go with it.\u201d I think that was really important. We celebrated the victory of having gotten it to there and really having cared. When we sold the company, I think that was the whirlwind. There was a lot of emotion with it. I woke up the next day. I\u2019m the same person. I\u2019ve still go to go to work. I\u2019ve still got to get it done. I think people think they\u2019re some kind of remarkable transformation from one day to the next and I think, actually, it\u2019s often a little bit of sadness. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, yeah. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Having spent time with a lot of people who just have more money than they could ever spend or even in some cases give away before they die, it rarely fixes as many things as you would hope. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0No question. The day of the approval, I will say we waited. What we knew is that the day we wanted the outcome just informs the FDA decision. So, it wasn\u2019t the day that we got the approval. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I see. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, they take their information in. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s one factor. Okay. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They get to go back, deliberate, and ultimately, the FDA comes forward with their decision and you wait. They actually send it to you late in the day. So, the entire company was in. We were all standing around, pink balloons everywhere waiting for a victory. What was actually so sweet about this is that all the other companies on the same floor \u2013 we were on the tenth floor of a building \u2013 I used to say we could almost entirely fit in an elevator and we were going to change the conversation about women and sex forever \u2013 they waited too. They stayed. I can remember them showing up and it was 7:00 at night and they were like, \u201cOh, my god, how are you guys doing? Is it okay? Are you not going to get the approval?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, that was fun that so many people \u2013 I was so lucky that as small as we were, we had this extraordinary group cheering us on. We had this incredible bench. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, as the fearless leader, you didn\u2019t know what the verdict was going to be. You had high hopes. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Did you have anything prepared \u2013 what were you going to do if it came back a no? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Celebrate that we did it all. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What were you going to say to the troops or if you had to imagine, if you can\u2019t remember what you would have said? Did you even think about it, really? What would you have said? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I didn\u2019t imagine a scenario in which we wouldn\u2019t win. The reason is I really thought that at the end of the day, we all had the capacity to get out of our own way, get beyond our own bias and look at the data. I think that in particular \u2013 look, I think that part of the characteristic of female leaders I love is a certain empathy. I felt like that data informed through a lens of empathy of having like walked a mile in the shoes of these women and now, we have all listened to them. I believed we would get there. I really did. What I would have said to the team had we lost is I would have said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you for putting it all in and for caring that deeply to see it all the way through.\u201d It was grueling work and long hours and a lot of punches in the face to get there. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Welcome to entrepreneurship. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Exactly. That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You\u2019re going to conquer the world, huh? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I will tell you, I have to go back to \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Do you have a mouthguard? Good. You\u2019re going to need that. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I\u2019m going back to your story for the people thinking about selling. Be a little bit reluctant to give it up. It\u2019s your point about who \u2013 he or she who cares the least \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0He who cares the least wins, yeah. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0When we went into our first negotiation with the company that ultimately bought it, we went into the room. They made an offer. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They said, \u201cWere going to walk out of the room.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m sorry. Say this one more time. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, the company that was offering to purchase us, we went to this room. They were very excited. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0This is the second company. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0This is for Sprout. Yes. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0We go into the room. Companies come courting. They want to buy us. They throw an offer down. They said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to let you guys think about that,\u201d and leave the room. One of the things I had done is I had prepared binders of all of our data, of all of our research, and it was huge. We brought him into the room and sat them down for effect. They left the room and I looked around at my team and I said, \u201cOkay, when I walk back in, within five minutes, we\u2019re going to all be out of our chairs and we\u2019re going to walk out of the room.\u201d They were like, \u201cWhat?\u201d So, they come back in the room and I said, \u201cThank you so much. We\u2019re very flattered by that offer. We\u2019re going to do it on our own.\u201d And as we got up, a woman who worked for me, she had all these binders sitting next to her. She\u2019s looking at me like, \u201cShould I take the binders?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cLeave them.\u201d So, we walk out of the room. Sure enough, I knew they would call me back to get those binders. So, they had a reason to reengage, which is, of course, \u201cHey, Cindy, we have these binders.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no, those are for you. You can keep them.\u201d But they called back a little while later and said, \u201cHey, we still have those binders we want to give back.\u201d So, the conversation continued. That\u2019s negotiation, right? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0But it was a fun story. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, for people listening who are like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s one in a million,\u201d no. This shit works. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. A couple of thoughts for people listening \u2013 number one is there is a book called \u201cGetting to Yes,\u201d \u201cHarvard Negotiation Project,\u201d etc. I think \u201cGetting Past No,\u201d which is another book written by one of the original coauthors is actually a little more realistic, where they talk about the BATNA, the best alternative to negotiated agreement. You really need to think this through. Negotiation rewards those who come in prepared. I remember at one point, I learned so much. I mentioned I lived in China for a while. It was in China where I really learned the flinch and realized, \u201cWow, you can actually improve so many deals just by letting someone negotiate against themselves.\u201d It\u2019s not like you\u2019re making a counter-offer. If you try to buy anything, at the time I think it was just called Silk Ally in Beijing, where you could by all the counterfeit Jordan shoes and all this stuff, they would always start off like 10X what any rational person would pay if they ever lived in China. Then you would counter and they go\u2026 Like you\u2019ve just \u2013 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Offended them. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You\u2019ve clubbed their dog or something. The emotion would come pouring out so exaggerated. You would see these foreign exchange students immediately capitulate or reverse and be like, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d And then they\u2019d walk off and you\u2019d just see these people laughing. It\u2019s like the flinch or silence, letting the silence doing the work. One that I encourage people to use \u2013 read the room, know the person across the table \u2013 but before you counter with anything, if you\u2019re not going to use silence, just saying something like, \u201cIs this the best offer you guys can make? Is this the best you guys can do?\u201d Don\u2019t be condescending about it, but just be like, \u201cJust so I\u2019m clear, is this the best you guys can offer?\u201d I would say depending on who you\u2019re dealing with, but the vast majority of the time, if it\u2019s not someone who\u2019s paid to negotiate, you\u2019re going to get something, but you have to be comfortable sitting in that silence. So, once approved, my homework says \u2013 it could be inaccurate \u2013 three competing offers, is that right? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Were those forthcoming? Were they inbound? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They were inbound. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. They were. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They were. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Walk me through, then, how you, in a competition/auction environment, how do you make the most of that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Well, for me, I think the winner emerged not on the basis of the price but on the basis of willingness to keep my team. That had been important to me when I sold my previous companies. In both of my companies, it was really important what happened to the people who came to work for me. So, that became one of the differentiators for me in the room, but no question when people know that others are interested, you do want that competitiveness because definitely it drives up the price and everything else. That\u2019s how I reached my final decision. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What were some of the most important terms? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0For me? It was that we were going to go the distance together, that it was still going to be realized, I think, on our terms, and that there was a real commitment to making it broadly affordably accessible to women, that they were going to march it across the globe. I can pull this incidence data out of the US, out of Brazil, out of the UK, wherever it may be, it\u2019s the same for women worldwide. That factor of what became so attractive to me in this one company that came forward who bought us \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Can you\u2026? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It was Valeant. Sure. So, when Valeant bought us, it was that they did this deliberately. So, they had acquired a lot. They were highly inquisitive. They were a company with a lot of McKinsey folks and maybe fewer traditional operators. Their greatest criticism at that time \u2013 it has changed \u2013 but at that time it was really no organic growth. So, I think they saw this product that had a lot of interest and an ability to prove it from scratch that they could grow it inside and they saw in me an operator who had been there, done that. So, that deal structure was such that here, I could go out and run. I had all of their resources, the ability to do it at a much bigger scale than I could have on my own, and I got to keep the team who cared so deeply that they got it to the finish line of approval. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And you had deliverables and measurables instead of best efforts. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best.\u201d Handshake. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely. How many salespeople are we going to have? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Thanks for the handshake, but my mama told me put it in writing. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s right. Exactly. These weren\u2019t extraordinary. They were sort of market standard for what is brand new category drug launch 101. So, they were reasonable expectations. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, let\u2019s fast-forward \u2013 we can spend a lot of time on any segment of your story. It\u2019s just so amazing. This is not as \u2013 it\u2019s rare, but it does happen, like this kind of thing does happen and it\u2019s happened to a few of my friends in tech, actually, who have the opportunity to then take back their company or product or whatever it is that they\u2019ve sold. So, what the hell happened? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Well, what happened is\u2026 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0First of all, if you\u2019re comfortable, I think it\u2019s public at this point \u2013 how much did Sprout sell for? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0$1 billion upfront. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0$1 billion. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0And we had a pretty impressive structure transaction on the backend. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Like earnout/royalties. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Correct. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, tres commas, for you Silicon Valley fans. Then what unfolds? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I couldn\u2019t have written it for a movie. I really couldn\u2019t have. So, we got the drug approved in August. Everybody had come courting after that advisory committee meeting. We announced our intention to sell and then it takes time for a deal to close. So, in that interim time, I\u2019m just running. I\u2019m building a salesforce. I\u2019m getting ready for launch. The deal is closing to full closure. Eleven days into our deal closing, the world basically went sideways for Valeant. If you follow pharma, you certainly know they were at about $260.00 a share the day they bought us. They\u2019ve traded as low as $8.00 in the last two years. It was just\u2026 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0For those people who don\u2019t know, why did that happen? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Accusation around drug pricing issues and also a non-disclosure of a pharmacy relationship that they hadn\u2019t disclosed. So, it really just \u2013 it went kaboom. It was so sad for me for all of these salespeople who had come to work for me. They weren\u2019t in the field a week before this happened. Me being who I am, here\u2019s my baby. We\u2019ve just gone out. The world is collapsing higher up. I\u2019m not getting information and I\u2019m screaming quite loudly. I think that just didn\u2019t fit for them at that moment. They had enough distraction. They did not need Cindy Whitehead screaming as well. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cHey, lady. We have enough stress.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I was invited to leave. They called me and they said, \u201cIt\u2019s clear you no longer want to be here,\u201d to which I\u2019m pretty sure my answer was, \u201cLike hell.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, as it turns out, you are no longer going to be here.\u201d I have to tell you, at that moment, for me, founder, sometimes you have to go, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m the founder and maybe there will be a personality conflict. They\u2019ve taken my baby. They\u2019ve paid good money.\u201d So, in an effort, I think, to check myself, I thought, \u201cI need to step to the sidelines and cheer everybody on. I need to be positive about this and optimistic that maybe with me removed it will be championed inside of the organization.\u201d Certainly, I wanted to protect all of my people who were still there. I think if I have one regret, it\u2019s that I didn\u2019t speak up then because what happened after I was gone is that they surely \u2013 I can\u2019t even say slowly but surely \u2013 pretty rapidly dismantled my whole organization and then everybody was gone. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now, there\u2019s more to the story. There is. Because of those important performance obligations, I had an opportunity when they weren\u2019t meeting those to go back and open a different discussion with them that ultimately became the basis of a lawsuit. In this time, they changed CEOs. We\u2019ve had a really positive \u2013 it became clear to me this was not going to be an area of focus. Again, remember, they had bought it very intentionally, but it was an outlier. It was different than what they had normally done and they didn\u2019t quite have the infrastructure inside to put that focus into it. So, I think what was starting off as a lawsuit to be able to get through the noise of everything they were going to ultimately became a discussion in, \u201cWhat\u2019s the win-win here? Nobody\u2019s winning. We\u2019re not winning. You\u2019re not winning. Women aren\u2019t winning.\u201d I think in exchange for dropping that lawsuit, they decided to give me the drug back. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0A few things \u2013 so, in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, they decided to give you the drug back. They did not charge you for the drug. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Correct. They gave me a loan. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0They gave you a $25 million loan to help you get started. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes, they did. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And did you and other people who had equity in your company when it sold have to give back the $1 billion? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0We did not. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s a good deal. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It\u2019s a good deal. We\u2019re pretty happy with it. But let me tell you \u2013 for my shareholders, I do think this speaks volumes to them. We could have stayed the course. We had a pretty explicit contract in terms of a lawsuit. Not a single one of my \u2013 this had to be approved by my shareholders to do this transaction \u2013 not a single one of them voted against it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Just to clarify, you\u2019re saying by all of your shareholders or a majority or board of directors? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0No, no, all of my shareholders voted. It had to be by a majority. But not a single one voted against it. Not a single one. That speaks volumes, I think, to who funded me, what they really cared about. An easier path to money was probably just staying on the path that we were on. This is the path of getting it right. This is about it always having been about the women and really defining success the way we want to. We had a great outcome for a company and now, we have the ability to just do it in a different way, in a way that we\u2019re all proud of. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I have plenty of questions, but what\u2019s next, then, for that particular drug? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0What\u2019s next is 101. It\u2019s access, that women have access to the product. It\u2019s education, that we remove some of the myth and misconception that surrounds female Viagra and the condition itself, and then I think it is marching across the globe. We\u2019ve got a lot of work in front of us. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Are you going to be at the helm? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. So many questions\u2026 Let\u2019s talk about rules for a second. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Okay. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I think you\u2019ve drawn this distinction. There are a lot of rules out there. There are some that you\u2019re generally better off following. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0The rules of law and order. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The rules of law and order, regulatory, and then there are unwritten rules or just socially reinforced rules. So, what are some of the rules that you have broken or routinely break as a matter of personal best practices? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I embrace under-estimation as an opportunity to surprise people. I think that I break rules in terms of it\u2019s frustrating to me when people say, \u201cYeah, but nobody does it that way.\u201d I\u2019m saying, \u201cOkay, nobody does it that way, like show me a rule in which I cannot do it that way.\u201d If they don\u2019t have an answer to that, be they a lawyer, a consultant, whoever they may be, that\u2019s an unacceptable answer. I think they just haven\u2019t dreamed up a new way to do something or a better way to do something. I think that particularly women in business, I think women are bound by many more unwritten rules. This TEDx Talk I gave was about this, like what\u2019s the DNA of a female rulebreaker because I think that it takes this extraordinary injustice and the empathy that surrounds that for them to really break a rule. That certainly is my story \u2013 fueled by the injustice, really informed by listening. Why would I move forward with something that nobody else was willing to do? I think there are rules about, \u201cDo you talk about money?\u201d I like to say in the Pinkubator, my goal is to make women really rich. That elicits a certain response. I do these pajama parties in the Pinkubator, eighth grade girls \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The Pinkubator \u2013 we\u2019re going to come back to this, but could you give us a sense or two on what that is? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. As part of the pink ceiling, I make early bets on breakthrough first either buyer for women and they all become part of my Pinkubator. So, I\u2019ve got ten different companies in there right now, all with a female lens. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How are you going to balance that with\u2026? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Having a great team. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Having a great team. It\u2019s certainly not all me. I didn\u2019t get to here without having had the most incredible people surround me, many of them do today. I\u2019m with people who know all of my stories because they\u2019ve been on the ride with me for 13+ years through the startups. So, it\u2019s always about the other people you surround yourself with. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So far, we\u2019ve talked about not necessarily the highlight reel, but we\u2019ve talked about a bunch of huge successes. I\u2019d love for you to talk about \u2013 this is from a bit of my homework also. Correct me if this is wrong and I\u2019d really love to dig in very briefly \u2013 for people listening, this isn\u2019t going to be all startup, finance for the next 30 minutes, so just sit tight. This will apply more broadly. But I read that one mistake that you made at one point in your business was taking money from someone you either didn\u2019t know very well or didn\u2019t trust. Can you talk about what you learned from that to the extent that you can disclose whatever you\u2019re comfortable disclosing and then how that informed later decisions or approaches? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0My biggest fail, really and truly. Early days of Slate, I was fortunate that this drug was adopted by the top-tier. They were out at medical conferences talking about it and all of a sudden, I\u2019m getting phone calls in from other people like, \u201cHey, I write testosterone. Why has nobody come by to see me?\u201d I really didn\u2019t have the capital to build a sales organization on my own. So, I went out with a company that would build a sales organization around it. I did the deal, all the right intentions, seemingly. It couldn\u2019t have departed more radically in terms of our philosophy on how you compensate people, on how you treat people. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And because you didn\u2019t have the money, you paid them in equity? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes. They had a seat on my board. They came into this company, had this partnership with them. It was that inexperience, I think, in my first company of going, \u201cGod, I need money. God, I need this partner. I need this for scale,\u201d and not being discriminating enough in terms of really who they were.\u201d So, it was painful because we really didn\u2019t get along. It had the ability to cripple the company. At that moment that I could cut the deal, I had swallowed hard, hired as many people as I could. Our eight people were out sell their 40, cut the deal and \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Cut meaning ended. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Ended it and went off to the races. But it taught me the lesson of \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How long did it take you to cut the deal? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0A year. I had a year agreement with them. It took years off my life. It didn\u2019t feel like a year. It felt like a longer than that. But it was a lesson of who I was going to raise money from going forward. This is the perfect segue to it. I had to buy out their position. I needed them the hell of my board. They could have stayed on the board even with that deal gone. I had people coming in to try to buy it out. Actually, one guy came in, a VC, and he came to our table. One of the things I want to do is I spent time with him and he came out to the glass table, where we have our lunch together every day. He was hideous to one of my sales reps, just like the attitude, how he treated them. I thought, \u201cAbsolutely not. I am not doing it.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve seen how this move turns out. Let\u2019s not do that.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0The next group came in. It was a family office. Also came, sat with my table, wanted them to be there. They said nothing. I was like, \u201cOh my god, we\u2019re not going to get the money. We\u2019re going under.\u201d It was so important. I needed to get this group out. They called me back and they said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to invest for what we saw at the table.\u201d So, they were the right person. I now started to understand I have to have people who care about who we are in our mission. So, I raised, actually, almost all of my money through basically angels or family offices, very unconventional in pharma. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How much funding? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0$100 million. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright. So, $100 million through angels \u2013 I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re not talking like $25,000.00 checks. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Correct. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How many of these people did you know in advance before raising the money? It doesn\u2019t need to be an exact number. What percentage of the people you raised money from did you know before hand? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Three. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. Roughly how many were there? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0 We were at a little over 100 in the end. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How they hell do you do that without it becoming your full-time job for six-plus months? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It grew through word of mouth. I was fortunate that they introduced me to a group or they introduced me to a group. So, I had pockets of investors that I treated almost like they were units. I have an incredible group of investors in Fort Worth, Texas. I love to go visit them. But it was so flattering, I think, that they helped me get there. I came from no background where I had access to this kind of privilege. I didn\u2019t know these high-net worth individuals. But I was fortunate that once one of them came in, they introduced me to others. There actually was great joy in communicating with them. I didn\u2019t see it as a full-time job. I actually saw it as an opportunity for this incredible network, who today come in on a lot of my companies as well and invest in them. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you choose people? How did you vet them? I know companies with \u2013 let\u2019s just say in contrast. You could certainly have, say, a VC, venture capitalist, or somebody who comes in, writes a huge check and they say, \u201cNumber one, I need 10, 20 percent of the company and I want at least one seat on the board.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That has its potential pitfalls. I\u2019ve also seen situations where startups that are super lean and have a small company have a ton of people on their cap table. They\u2019ve taken a ton of investors. All of a sudden, they\u2019re getting the hug of death, basically, because even if the investors are trying to be helpful, they\u2019re managing communications with 100 people. So, how did you think about avoiding that? Family offices are kind of a unique animal, but how did you think about avoiding that potential problem? \u00a0 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I actually think I was hyper-communicative myself. I went on the offense on that. They were part of this with me. They were part of the ride. I was going to turn around to them and say, \u201cHow are you going to help me? Who are you going to introduce me to? What am I not thinking of here?\u201d These are very impressive people. So, I think I didn\u2019t wait for that to choke me. If anything, they would tell you like I communicated a lot. I expected a lot of them. I felt like they were part of it. They were owners in this and they had to perform not unlike the owners of my employees. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I promised we\u2019d come back to the Pinkubator. So, what is The Pink Ceiling? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, The Pink Ceiling is investment firm meets hell of a great place for mentorship, where we make bets on early stage companies by or for women. Mostly all health tech and not only, I think, disruptive first, but often products that can be catalysts in social conversations we care about. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What would be some examples of products or companies? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0So, a company with a technology that detects date rape drugs in drinks. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How does it detect? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Through color change. So, dip your finger in a drink, touch your finger to the decal. It changes colors if there\u2019s a date rape drug. I have two nieces in college. It\u2019s sad that we need a product like this, but we need to put power in the hands of women \u2013 great company. It\u2019s sort of the quintessential fit for who we were. Love the tech \u2013 first of its kind, patented, but also just love the social conversation it promotes. Flushable pregnancy test coming out, great female founder \u2013 I think only a woman would have thought of that. It\u2019s not your mother\u2019s pregnancy test, right? In so many ways, not only in the eco way, but I think also because we have this belief that all women want a certain outcome when they take a pregnancy test. Some women want to get rid of the evidence, including women who are going through infertility and don\u2019t want a daily reminder. That\u2019s a product. I have a great young female founder who has a biometric sensor to recognize deviations in movement for athletes so they can start to signal when you\u2019re moving differently and may injure in the future. She\u2019s such a story \u2013 mother was a Russian mail order bride, wanted to move herself and her daughter to a better life, came over to the US in a pretty poor neighborhood. She thought, \u201cMy only way out is if I get a scholarship in athletics,\u201d became a nationally ranked soccer player, injured. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, soccer is brutal.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0She decided, \u201cOkay, I still have upper body strength, became a rower, got a full ride to Duke, and then invented this tech. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh my god, what a beast. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Love her. When Ivana walked in the room, I will tell you \u2013 when she walked in the room, I was buying no matter what she was selling. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0She didn\u2019t have to yell, \u201cBalls,\u201d for you. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0No, she did not. I didn\u2019t tell her this at the moment, but I was investing because even if this wasn\u2019t her deal, the next one was going to be. So, it\u2019s fun because I get to bet on these great people, doing, I think, really interesting things. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Where is it based? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0We\u2019re in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I\u2019ve built all my companies. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What should people know about Raleigh? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0People should know that Raleigh is number two in the country in terms of exits. I think that surprises people. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I didn\u2019t know that. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0There you go. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You would expect me to know that and I didn\u2019t. Shame on me. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Pitchbook did the terms of the multiples we get out of companies. So, the next billion-dollar company will come from Raleigh, just like who knew the birthplace of female Viagra was Raleigh, North Carolina? Great startup scene, wonderful talent in that area. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m going to read a quote and it may be off, but I liked it. So, I thought maybe I could ask you to elaborate on it. I\u2019m not sure where I found this, but I think it\u2019s yours. \u201cWe talk all the time about how women need a voice. We don\u2019t need a voice. We need power. Money is power.\u201d Please explain or please, tell me where that comes from. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I think we just \u2013 we\u2019re constantly in the discussion around women talking about needing a voice. What really changes is when women have power. The power that comes with money is to sit on the other side of the table and make the decisions \u2013 2 percent of VC funding goes to women, 2 percent. That means we think have the population have 2 percent of the good ideas. It\u2019s ridiculous. If you consider it, what we need to do is get women to outcomes like mine so they get to sit on the table, sit at the other side of the table and pick those things they really care about. Not pass over a product for women thinking it\u2019s a niche brand. I think it\u2019s also just this comfort with the conversation around money. I started talking about these pajamas parties in the Pinkubator. We have eighth-grade girls come through. We do all these drills or setting their sites for the C-suite. The first group we ever had come in, one of their teachers came and she said, \u201cOh, Cindy, when they were coming over here, they wanted to ask you about money but we told them you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, no, no, have them ask me.\u201d The young girl who was asking me all the questions and getting to the real data, that girl is going to create a big company. That\u2019s okay to have that conversation. Even as a woman, those are some of the unwritten rules. When I first got an opportunity to go out and speak on these stages to rising star female entrepreneurs or women in business, a woman came up to me and said, \u201cI love that you don\u2019t ever say that you sold your company for over $1 billion.\u201d The next time I got up on stage, I said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Cindy Whitehead. I sold my last company for $1 billion,\u201d because I was clear that, \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m doing it.\u201d Here\u2019s why I say it happily \u2013 because women will pay it back. They\u2019ll give it back to other women. They\u2019ll give it back into their community. There\u2019s plenty of data sources on that. What I love to see and my greatest pride has been the ripple effect of ownership. Everyone who came to work for me got skin in the game. To watch our outcomes and what it has meant for them in terms of freedom \u2013 I don\u2019t really mean financial freedom. If you\u2019re in it just for the money, you\u2019re never going to be successful. But it affords them not only financial freedom, but freedom to do the things they really care about. I\u2019m watching them start their own companies or fund their children\u2019s companies. That\u2019s what I love to see as an army pink ladies coming out of the Pinkubator who are sponsoring the next group to do it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I love that you also caught yourself or even if you didn\u2019t have that as a subconscious behavior, made it a point to get up and say what you might have not been saying. I think this underscores something really critical, which is we \u2013 and this is not gender-specific, anyone \u2013 we often think of the external opponents and how we might be restricted by someone else, which could very well be the case and is the case very often. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0However, when you\u2019re looking for unwritten rules, it\u2019s important not to just look at unwritten rules that are being imposed on you externally, but to look at the unwritten rules you were following. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Absolutely. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I remember talking to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to name her because I don\u2019t have her permission \u2013 but super successful female entrepreneur and I asked her what some of the main challenges were she thought women were facing. She mentioned quite a few, which you\u2019re very familiar with. But one that I didn\u2019t expect was she said women need to learn how to ask for raises and negotiate. A lot of them just don\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t know exactly why that is, but I was like, \u201cOh, fuck.\u201d When I think about the female founders I\u2019ve invested in, whether it\u2019s Leah at TaskRabbit, which was acquired not too long ago by Ikea, or Tracy DiNunzio or any number of these women, they are all so good at negotiating. It didn\u2019t even cross my mind that I was like, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d It\u2019s certainly true for a lot of men as well. The point being be really cognizant of \u2013 this definitely goes for everybody, not just women, but where you are following rules that are really just enforced in your own mind. You can certainly experiment with bending and breaking.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0 I think a lack of asking for raises is also that discomfort or that don\u2019t brag. It\u2019s sort of not lady-like to talk about money or be capitalistic, if you will. I think that has an incredible effect that maybe we\u2019re not so conscious of. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, totally. If you were going to teach, say, a freshman class \u2013 I\u2019ll come back to the freshman class again \u2013 or a class, if you were going to teach a seminar \u2013 it could be any age range. You could pick your audience. It could be female-only. It could be mixed gender. It doesn\u2019t matter. What would you teach? What would the seminar look like? It\u2019s like once a week, two or three hours a week. You have as many weeks as you want. What would you teach? It doesn\u2019t have to be anything we talked about. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0What would I teach? I would push people around how you\u2019re going to make choices in life. I think that my teaching would be how do you set out there and sort of remove all of those confinements in thinking. I am lucky, I think, having grown up in such a mobile childhood. I think what it taught me is you can imagine I was always \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Mobile, physically mobile. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Physically mobile. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Was your dad State Department? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0State Department, yeah. I was the perpetual new kid and always having to have that agony of what was going to happen. It turned out nothing bad happened, right? In retrospect, I went in anticipating that. I think that really helped me. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a course. Is that a course? Can I teach a course in losing the fear? What\u2019s the worst that can happen and helping folks go through that? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. You can just have case study after case study after case study. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I think when I do the Pinkubator, I\u2019m teaching a course in, really at its core, confidence for these girls. It\u2019s confidence in the choices that they make and going all in when they\u2019re going to do it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019d love to actually hear you elaborate on that. I\u2019m looking through my many, many, many notes. One of the things I highlighted where I was like, \u201cYes, please, thank you for that,\u201d this is for Fortune. The question was, \u201cWhat advice would you give early stage founders?\u201d And it was, \u201cEmbrace the workhorse to become the unicorn. I\u2019m so tired of all the grandiose startup speak, the founders who declare their genius before they ever even execute it. So, what I tell founders is don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to change the world. Put your head down, do the work and show me.\u201d So, assuming that\u2019s somewhat accurate, I\u2019m asked all the time, \u201cHow do I build my confidence?\u201d or, \u201cHow can I become confident?\u201d The best answer I\u2019ve been able to come up with \u2013 and this is just my perspective \u2013 is you have to actually believe in yourself. The way you develop that belief is by actually getting onto the playing field and taking your lumps, but proving to yourself that you have certain competencies. It\u2019s not about like Stuart Smalley sitting in front of a mirror telling yourself how awesome you are and believing that and then going out and getting your face ripped off by the real world. No, you actually have to put in the time to earn the confidence that you then carry. What has your experience been or how do you think of that with the startup founders? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Well, look, I\u2019m particularly focused on women and I think that just by virtue of the numbers, they tend to be unexpected in the room. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do you mean by that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They\u2019re unexpected. By the numbers, we\u2019re not expecting them to walk through the room and ask for the money. They\u2019re not likely to get the funding, all of that. I think that\u2019s certainly been the course of my career. When you say pharmaceutical CEO who sold the last business for $1 billion, nobody imagines me showing up in hot pink. I don\u2019t look the part. I\u2019m not your classic in any way and I think that\u2019s been sort of the story of my career in terms of places I\u2019ve gone or products I\u2019ve taken on have been unexpected. So, as a result of being unexpected, I think it\u2019s underestimated. So, my key piece of advice is underestimation, you have two choices \u2013 you can either reel back in frustration and self-doubt, you can let that eat away at you, or you can gamify it as this opportunity to surprise people with your competence. So, I think that for founders, I\u2019m looking at how they reframe the frustrations, the setbacks, the kicks in the teeth to this opportunity to go forward and surprise. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do you say to women \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you get this question \u2013 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s confidence. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. What do you say to women \u2013 I don\u2019t get this question because I\u2019m not a woman, but I\u2019ve certainly, with some of my founders, they get this question a lot from other founders, which is the belief \u2013 it might not even be a question that women should dial back their womenness, femininity \u2013 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Did you hear my reaction? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I did hear that. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I choked. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I did hear the choke. This seems to be a very common belief, not just among women, but certainly advice that men would give to women. It\u2019s very prevalent. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0The worst. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do you think of that? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0The worst advice. It\u2019s given and it\u2019s given woman to woman, for sure. Whatever it may be, I absolutely \u2013 part of the reason I wear pink \u2013 so, I wear pink all the time. You should see my closet. But when I went through the process with the \u201cfemale Viagra,\u201d it was called the little pink pill. People all but patted me on the shoulder and said, \u201cThat\u2019s cute.\u201d The little pink pill was so dismissive that I realized, \u201cMy god, this is a conversation we need to be having.\u201d I started showing up in blazing pink to the FDA. \u201cHi, we\u2019re going to talk about this.\u201d I think what it taught me is like in gender stereotypes or that underestimation, you run away from it. I guess, if you\u2019re me, you run right toward it. The idea that there isn\u2019t something valuable and unique that a woman brings to the table and in owning her femininity \u2013 you know, pink for me is about owning it as a woman, unapologetically pink. I like pink. I\u2019m going to wear it. We\u2019re going to have this conversation. So, I think that\u2019s the way to go. I tell women all the time, \u201cIf you are in an environment in which you need to not wear makeup, pull your hair back, not be you\u2026\u201d Listen, I was at a table \u2013 I won\u2019t name the\u00a0 conference \u2013 where were giving advice to younger women across the table. A woman very accomplished sitting to might right told a woman, \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty. You need to pull your hair back and not wear any makeup.\u201d I said, \u201cAbsolutely not. If you\u2019re in an environment in which you need to do that, move.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. So, I love the reason for the pink. It makes me think of a conversation I had with Amanda Palmer, the musician, on this podcast. She\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s a hell of a character, certainly has her fair share of controversy. I don\u2019t know how this came up exactly, but I heard her referring to herself or her friends calling her Amanda Fucking Palmer, AFP. At some point, I was like, \u201cWhat is the story with this Amanda Fucking Palmer?\u201d It turns out that one of her frenemies or just straight up enemies or somebody who hated her always referred to her as Amanda Fucking Palmer. Instead of letting it bother her, the way she put it to me was take that pain and wear it as a shirt, basically. I\u2019m paraphrasing. I love the fact that she took this barb or something that was thrown at her and turned it around and like co-opted it in and used it in such a way that she found empowering and maybe just funny to start with, but disarmed it in that way. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I thought it was just fantastic. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s awesome. I love it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I think we should just do a round two at some point or an extension. I\u2019m not going to ask all of my rapid fire questions, but I do want to ask two or three of them. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Okay. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, the first is what book or books have you gifted the most to other people? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0\u201cPurple Cow.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cThe Purple Cow?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah, I have to everybody who\u2019s worked for me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What books besides that have you reread yourself the most, if any come to mind? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I won\u2019t name one of yours because that seems too flattering. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No, no, no, more, more, more. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0What else have I read that I love? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If none come to mind, that\u2019s fine too. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Pat Lencioni\u2019s books \u2013 I love that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is it, like \u201cThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0\u201cFive Temptations of a CEO.\u201d Yeah. I think it was about what do you prioritize, what do you let go \u2013 I thought that was actually a great book. Maybe they\u2019re simple reads that I need on the airplane. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is the last time that you cried tears of joy? This is a new one. Or the time that comes to mind\u2026 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I rescued a pig. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You rescued a pig? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I cried tears of joy for taking this animal out of a terrible situation. I love animals. So, I went across the state and rescued a pig in a Porsche. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do you find a pig needing rescuing? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I was worried that my car was never going to smell the same. Just through a network, like knowing that, but I cried tears \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The pig called a scientist and he said, \u201cI can\u2019t help you, but I know a lady who can.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I cried tears of joy for making a better life. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Hold on a second \u2013 this is a full-grown pig? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Like hundreds of pounds pig? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Not a hog, like a pot-belly, but still big. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Are you now the caretaker of said pig? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. I think it\u2019s important to have \u2013 sort of in my daily routine, I\u2019ve still got to scrape the shit off my boots. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, you have a pet pig? Amazing. That\u2019s incredible. The most impressive \u2013 I hope I\u2019m getting this right. I\u2019m a little low on caffeine right now, but Jessie Graff, who\u2019s an incredible phenom in the \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d world, the most impressive hand strength maybe of anyone I\u2019ve ever seen, certainly any woman. She\u2019s probably 30 times stronger than I am, at least, which maybe isn\u2019t saying a lot, but like 1,000 times stronger. Incredible athlete. She has a pet pig as well, for those interested. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s cool. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Jessie, call me and tell me what to do. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Jessie, if you\u2019re listening, let her know, best practices, best pig practices. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love or love doing? I\u2019ll give you an example just to buy some time. I\u2019ll give you some time to think. When I asked Cheryl Strayed this question, who wrote \u201cWild\u201d and has done many other things and written many other books, she said, \u201cWell, I like to rearrange my sandwiches. So, the first thing I do when I get a sandwich is I rearrange the inside so that with every bite, you get an everything bite. It\u2019s very important that the avocado and the tomatoes and so on are very evenly distributed.\u201d She will also do this for, I think, her husband\u2019s sandwich and rearrange it. That\u2019s pretty odd. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That is pretty weird, yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0There are a lot of weird things that everybody does. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I like it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is one of yours? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I was going to say nickname people, but that seems so vanilla now. What is the most absurd thing I like to do? I climb and sit in the sink to put my makeup on, which is really weird. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s unusual. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It\u2019s kind of weird. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Do you have any superstitions? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0When I was a little girl, I was in the Fiji Islands. So, I had a very unusual childhood where there was a lot of superstition. So, I think being exposed to that young made me lose that later in life, not so sure they were true, not so sure they were worth buying into at that age. They created a lot of fear unnecessarily. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Do you have any examples? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0In that culture, everything was very superstitious that if you didn\u2019t see the fish first, you didn\u2019t get in the water. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Good omen, bad omen. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. I think at a young and impressionable age, they probably had an effect where I decided, \u201cI\u2019m not going to worry about this going forward. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If you had to give a TED Talk on something no one would expect \u2013 it can\u2019t be the pharma stuff, it can\u2019t be the company building stuff\u2026 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0A TED Talk on something people wouldn\u2019t expect\u2026 Growing up in a third-world country? I don\u2019t know. Could I do that one? Lessons learned? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What I you had six months to prepare for a TED Talk but it had to be on a new skill. What would you focus on? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Oh my god, I would learn how to fiddle. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Fiddle? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Totally. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Fiddle like Irish bar music fiddle? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah, for sure. I would learn how to do that and I would teach everybody else. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Is this something you just came up with or is this something you thought about, like, \u201cOne day, I should learn the fiddle.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yes, I would love to learn how to fiddle. I feel I don\u2019t have any music talent. It sucks. I would like to be able to do that. That\u2019s a good party trick. I need a better party trick than my sexual medicine card. It\u2019s not good enough. It\u2019s not taking me far. I need to play music or inspire through that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, I will tell you, as someone who has been fantasizing about and simultaneously putting off voice lessons for probably a decade \u2013 I just started about a month ago, I want to say, or six weeks ago. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s awesome. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0One of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0That\u2019s cool. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s really been empowering and also worth doing, in terms of the fiddle, just so that you listen to music differently. Now I hear things totally differently, which is totally cool. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Next time I come on, I\u2019m going to fiddle at the beginning. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You don\u2019t have to get good. Please, yes. Some people hate my intro music. So, perhaps I can license for a reasonable fee your fiddle. What do you do when you feel overwhelmed or unfocused? What do you do to get back on track or let some pressure out of the tires?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I usually call my big brothers. I think that they\u2019re very \u2013 they\u2019re like the exact right balance of kicking me in the ass and encouraging me. So, when I\u2019m feeling like overwhelmed or anything else, nothing like my family to be totally unimpressed with my problems and kick me in the ass. I think that\u2019s what I do. I probably call my big brothers. They\u2019ve been hugely influential in my life. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Can you think of an example of them kicking you in the ass or what they would say to you to be like, \u201cReally?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. I think it\u2019s just generally\u2026 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do they do professionally, if you don\u2019t mind me asking? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Sure. So, one is a lawyer, who actually, has an operating role in a big construction company, and the other one was a startup guy, who\u2019s head of sales and marketing for a company. He was a big part of why I went smaller when I left my big company career. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0When you left Merck? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. He said, \u201cGo smaller, push yourself, challenge yourself.\u201d I knew I didn\u2019t fit in big environments. So, he was important in that. But I can call my brothers, same thing, overwhelmed or overly enthused about myself, like, \u201cHey, did you see that I was just on with Tim Ferriss,\u201d like, \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s great. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Don\u2019t be too proud of yourself. So, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re classic big brothers. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cTim who, that shiny gnome with a big head?\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u201cNot impressed.\u201d Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They like a lot of mockery. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, they\u2019ve also both spent quite a bit of time in the trenches. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0They have. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0They\u2019ve played full-contact sports. So, that\u2019s always very helpful. If you could have a word, a message, a quote on a billboard to get out to millions, billions, metaphorically speaking, a lot of people, what would you put on it? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Can I put it in the Valley? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Sure. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I\u2019d put, \u201cFuck the Unicorn, Be the Workhorse.\u201d I\u2019d like that to get out to millions of people in the Valley. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yes. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It would make me super happy. This is my distaste for all the grandiose speak in step and I think the lack of attention on the fundamentals. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Show, don\u2019t tell, friend. Get it done. How has a failure or an apparent failure set you up or led to later success, contributed to later success? I mean one potential example would be the decision to take that money from someone who your spider sense told you you shouldn\u2019t take money from, right? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Are there any other examples that come to mind? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Professionally, that\u2019s certainly been the worst. I\u2019m thinking of huge personal failures of mine that have taught me lessons along the way. I\u2019ve probably crashed and burned a lot going through childhood of trying to figure out how to fit in in new environments and playing to the popular thought and it not working because it wasn\u2019t authentically who I am. I think at some point, I became comfortable that I might just be the outlier. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s funny about being the outlier is you tend to attract other outliers. Then it kind of works out. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0It does work. I love it, the band of misfits. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I was just going to say that exact thing. Wow, I\u2019ve never said that before. That\u2019s crazy \u2013 band of misfits. Well, I think at this point, I would just say where can people find you? Where can people say hello? Where can people see what you\u2019re up to? Where would you like people to wave a hand on the internets? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I\u2019d love for people to find me online. On Twitter, I\u2019m @CindyPinkCEO, that or on Insta. I\u2019d love for people to find me there, considering I\u2019m so late to the social media party. Being in a regulated industry with my point of view, my lawyers are pretty sure I should not be on social media. So, it\u2019s been a pretty fun journey in these last two years. I\u2019ve got a lot to say. So, I\u2019d love for them to find me there and say something back. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Cool. I will put those in the show notes as well for folks. Do you have any final parting words, advice, an ask of the audience, something they should consider, anything? Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Look, I\u2019m going to play to my group that I\u2019m looking out for, which is female founders. I\u2019m just going to ask you to share the stories, share the stories of success. I think it matters that we do that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I agree. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Just recently, I learned that only 17 percent of those profiled on Wikipedia are women. More than that deserve to be profiled with their stories. I thank you too for having me on today for that reason. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Of course. My pleasure. For what it\u2019s worth \u2013 this could be taken the wrong way by some people, but hopefully not \u2013 I didn\u2019t invite you on because you\u2019re a woman. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I get it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I invited you on because you\u2019re a good entrepreneur. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Thank you. I appreciate that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If that also gets more women on the show, fantastic. They are out there. I\u2019m really glad you took the time. Thank you for being on the show. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0I think it\u2019s your question to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d I do think people should ask themselves that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Absolutely. That is one of the most empowering questions. You have to spend some time on it. If it\u2019s just a big scary shadow, it\u2019s going to continue to be a big scary shadow. You have to shine light on it. For people who want to explore that, you can just check out my TED Talk, tim.blog/ted. This has been really fun. Cindy Whitehead:\u00a0Really fun. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Thank you for taking the time. We have so many other questions we could explore, but I\u2019ll let you get back to your evening. For everybody listening or watching, hi, as always, you can find links to everything we\u2019ve discussed, books, resources, @CindyPinkCEO on Twitter, Instagram, all of the places in the show notes, tim.blog/podcast for this episode and every other.

If you\u2019re a long-time listener of the show or brand new to the podcast, my favorite Finnish entrepreneurs who founded this company \u2013 of course, I don\u2019t know that many Finnish entrepreneurs, but they may be my favorites \u2013 have something new that I\u2019ve been loving. Some of you are familiar with Four Sigmatic. I\u2019ve used their products for years now. They were introduced to me by an acrobat of all folks and they tend to mix different types of medicinal mushrooms into their products. I have recently started using their matcha, which is a green tea, which is designed as a coffee alternative. If you\u2019re trying to cut back on caffeine, as I am these days, the matcha is a great option and one that I originally learned to love in Japan. It has a very smooth texture to it. Their matcha blend in particular includes the amino acid L-theanine, which helps to provides a balance-boosted energy without the jitters. It also includes the adaptogen astragalus, if I \u2018m pronouncing that correctly, which may help with overall stress tolerance. For those of you that are wondering, no, the products don\u2019t taste like mushrooms. If they say mushroom coffee, for instance, another product I use, it doesn\u2019t taste like mushrooms. It tastes like coffee. But you get the nutritional benefits of some of these special ingredients. So, the products don\u2019t taste like mushrooms and are enjoyable. I offer them to my houseguests and use them myself and I don\u2019t particularly want to drink anything that tastes like mushrooms. So, moving on \u2013 the folks at Four Sigmatic have designed a few special deals for you guys, my listeners, which include many of my favorite products of theirs. So, check it out. Visit foursigmatic.com/timtim to see these special deals, which are not offered anywhere else.

"so proud of this opportunity, i get in front of the room", "you can imagine", "here\u2019s me in the hot pink, head to toe", "i start to talk about women and sex and the whole room starts to giggle", "i can feel this giggle going off across the crowd and i\u2019m panicking watching the clock count down", "so, i can remember reaching to my laptop, fast-forwarding as fast as i can to a slide that was just brain scan studies, studies of women with this condition versus women without, where in black and white, we could see there is a biological basis to women\u2019s lack of desire for sex", "so, i put the slide up", "i turned and pointed", "long enough for it to be uncomfortable for everybody, i went silent", "when i did that, i said, \u201care you looking at what i\u2019m looking at because i\u2019m just here to talk about the biology of sex for women.\u201d it\u2019s an important lesson for me of what i was going to have to do to make people focus", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, you let the silence do the work", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it was uncomfortable", "i figured it was long enough for it to be uncomfortable for me, which was a fair trade for them having made me really uncomfortable as they started giggling and wouldn\u2019t pay attention to me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0silence", "yeah", "it\u2019s so powerful", "it\u2019s so, so powerful", "i remember advice i was given at one point \u2013 well, i was given that advice first by someone named cal fussman, who\u2019s a master interviewer, when he was going over some transcripts from this podcast in the early days", "he\u2019s like,

story", "so, speaking of letting the silence do the work, i\u2019m going to go silent really quick because i want to ask you two questions that might take a few minutes to answer, but i\u2019m going to start with the short one", "what is your favorite business and why", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0my favorite business of all is wegmans, which if anybody is from the northeast, they appreciate this is a grocery store", "how can you get excited about a grocery story", "i\u2019m excited because it\u2019s from my birthplace, rochester, and i went there every sunday as a little girl", "here\u2019s why i loved it \u2013 because of the incredible loyalty that they instilled", "how do you get folks that are cashiers at the checkout line with jobs that may seem relatively unexciting to show up every day with unbridled enthusiasm for what the do", "so, it opened years later \u2013 i moved my whole life \u2013 it opened in the dc area", "i went the first day that wegmans opened in dc and i walked up and all of their employees were standing outside holding their hands above their head like a w because they have wegmans pride, the wegmans way", "i\u2019ve got to tell you, that first day, anybody in the entire dc metro area who had ever been to a wegmans showed up and stood in line to walk through this store", "i love them for being a private, family-held business that has that kind of loyalty and longevity of employees", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how do they instill that", "i mean, is it filtering for the right employees who are prone to that to begin with", "is it something else", "how do they develop that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i think it is oh-so-simple", "i think it is their basic appreciation for the people who show up and work for them every day", "they reward them through the right incentives, they reward them through the best benefits, they help develop them, they encourage them when they lose weight", "there are all of these incentives to their employees to make them truly feel that appreciation from their employer and also, i think, be proud to work there", "they go home and have pride in saying who they work for", "so, i started studying businesses i loved at a very young age", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i had a conversation with frank blake, former ceo of home depot right here, sitting where you are", "they developed this orange apron cult, as it was sometimes referred to", "the dedication that some of these employees showed was incredible", "his point was, \u201cone of the systems i instilled was positive reinforcement by sharing stories on a very regular, scheduled basis of standout customer service.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0incredible", "yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i have to tell you, i sold my first business late", "i sold it to a group that was private equity-backed", "i ran into one of those guys, one of the bankers years later and he said, \u201cthat group you had, they were almost cult-like.\u201d i think he said it with sort of one eyebrow raised, like, \u201chmm\u2026\u201d and i said, \u201cwhy, thank you.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0\u201cthank you for that.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s the nicest compliment i\u2019ve ever received.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0you mean in the apple way, not the david koresh way", "perfect", "i\u2019ll take it", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0exactly", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, the next question, which will seem odd to people listening, but will soon make more sense, is not really a question", "i\u2019ll be polite and make it a question", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0okay", "tim ferriss:\u00a0could you please give me your three-minute commercial", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0okay", "tim ferriss:\u00a0tell me about yourself, soup to nuts", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0alright", "i moved my entire childhood", "so, every year from 4th to 12th grade, i was in a different school", "so, i was the perpetual new kid", "i think what that did was perfect my ability to stand on the outside of the room and look in and really listen, understand motivations, understand the dynamic, which served me well later in life", "at the time, i went kicking and screaming", "i have a love that started very young in life for what makes businesses great", "so, as i went through college, i was fortunate to have a great business professor who really cultivated that in me", "so, i\u2019d have to report to her every week what my favorite business was, why, what they were doing differently", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0and along that way, i made a unilateral decision that i was going to go work for merck", "so, she thought i should probably broaden my options", "it wasn\u2019t such a slam dunk", "i told her, \u201cno, i\u2019m going to work for merck.\u201d they weren\u2019t hiring when i got out of school, but eight months later, they were, and i got the job", "i called her up", "i said, \u201ci got that job that you said i might not.\u201d and she said, \u201cgreat", "we\u2019re going out to dinner and you\u2019re buying.\u201d so, i went to work for merck", "i started in pharma because it was fortune\u2019s most admired company", "that\u2019s why i went there", "i wanted to learn from the best", "i thought i would actually take it elsewhere and apply it", "i didn\u2019t really think i was going to be so fascinated with the science, fell in love with the science and the innovation, what it could mean in people\u2019s lives", "i loved what pharma had the capacity to do, hated how they got it done in the bigger companies", "so, i made the leap, went smaller, smaller, and smaller until i ultimately was maybe crazy enough to start it for myself", "i built two businesses, both in sexual health", "people say, \u201cwhy?\u201d i say, \u201cirish catholic, of course.\u201d so, i built a business slate with the only long-acting testosterone for men", "that made me on the path of watching this emergent science for women", "when this drug was put on the shelf by the company that invented it, i made a decision to sell that off and take it on and got the only ever drug approved for sexual desire in women", "i sold that business and now as a pass through, do nothing but spend my time reaching my hand back and trying to get female founders there to my kind of outcomes faster than i got there myself", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that was really good", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0how many minutes", "tim ferriss:\u00a0now, i wasn\u2019t watching the time, but if i had to use my spider sense\u2026 cindy whitehead:\u00a0your listeners will know", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if i had to use my spider sense, i think that was really, really close", "so, i\u2019m very impressed", "for people who are wondering, \u201cwhat the hell is tim doing", "this is the oddest interview i\u2019ve ever heard him attempt to give,\u201d it is because why", "what do the last two questions have in common", "why did i ask those two questions", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0you asked those two questions because i love to ask those questions of everybody i interview because i think that if you\u2019ll just be quiet and listen, which you heard a little bit from my background, people will tell you a lot about themselves and what their motivations are", "so, that was always probably my initial question in interviewing and figuring out from people what they would tell me about themselves", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what would you look for", "were there any particular checkered flags, meaning fantastic, or red flags, meaning, \u201cmaybe not a good person to pick?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0for me, it was discomfort with change, the lack of adaptability because in my environments, they were not the same structure that they might have been coming from", "they were going to have to be nimble, have to move quickly to keep pace", "i always laid my cards at the table at the end of interviews and said, \u201chere\u2019s who we are", "here\u2019s this culture", "we both should lay our cards on the table because six months from now, i don\u2019t want us to be unhappy with each other.\u201d so, i think i\u2019m always listening for those cues that would indicate a fit for my environment", "and in it, i think i was finding the people with a love of businesses", "i often ask that question, \u201cwhat is the business that you most admire?\u201d because they\u2019ve got to have that passion", "i think particularly in small and startup, you have to have a real love affair with what it is that makes things tick", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what did you study in undergrad", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0business", "tim ferriss:\u00a0business", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what did your business professor do besides have you report back each week on your favorite business of the week", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i think she just took a special interest", "i think she saw something there and cultivated it so that she was pushing me", "so, not only did she push me with the assignment that was above and beyond what she was asking of everybody else", "but i think she also tortured me a little bit with the doubt to see if i would push through it", "when i said to her, \u201ci\u2019m going to go work for merck,\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cwell, i don\u2019t know", "your science grades aren\u2019t that good.\u201d she really pushed back like it wasn\u2019t such a sure thing", "so, she was constantly setting the bar for me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, i don\u2019t know if you had a chance to ask her, but did she genuinely think that you would have trouble getting the job or was it a yoda trick to get you to stubbornly pursue it twice as hard", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0100 percent a stubborn trick", "i think she knew that i have sort of a healthy chip on my shoulder of proving it", "so, she was definitely pushing right at that button of, \u201cgo out there and prove it.\u201d so, yeah, very clever", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, how does one start a pharma company without a pharma background", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0well, pharma background in that i\u2019d been in the industry for a long time", "so, i had the right contacts", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you had the industry experience", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i had the industry experience, yes", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you\u2019re right", "i didn\u2019t word that very well \u2013 without the\u2026 cindy whitehead:\u00a0the scientific background", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s right", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0surround yourself with an extraordinary scientific team", "i feel like i\u2019ve learned at the hands of some of the best in science", "i think i\u2019ve always brought a lens to it of what would work in the market", "we were sort of a magical pairing because many times in science, you can get enamored in the lab with things and not look outside to what\u2019s really going to work in the mainstream", "so, it was a lot about having just a great team", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you pick \u2013 cindy whitehead:\u00a0and i can play a doctor on tv now", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you can", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yes, or i at least think i can", "tim ferriss:\u00a0or via people\u2019s earbuds if they may have them", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah, that\u2019s right", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you end up choosing the \u2013 you said long-acting testosterone", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0testosterone", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, paint a picture of us", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0sure", "tim ferriss:\u00a0we can certainly get into testosterone and like hpta and all this fun stuff", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0sure", "tim ferriss:\u00a0but i don\u2019t want to bore some segment of my population of listeners to death, although i am fascinated by it", "so, we probably will get into it", "how did you end up choosing that", "did it start with finding the opportunity and then, \u201ci want to start a company?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cindy whitehead:\u00a0no", "tim ferriss:\u00a0or did you decide, \u201ci want to start a company now", "let me try to find a product?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0that was it", "yeah", "i wanted to start my own company", "i felt like i had a hypothesis", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old were you at the time or where were you in time", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i was in my early 30s at the time when i started it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "got it", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i had one career experience that was very informative", "so, i had been at a company that was acquired", "they had been gobbled up by somebody who had gobbled up a lot and then they had to integrate them", "i got to be on that team", "so, i got this put together of the perfect company", "that was a great career moment for me", "then i got to go apply it doing my own", "the reason i did it is for that same reason", "i love pharma for what it can do", "at 3:00 a.m", "in the morning, if you\u2019re sick, you love pharma", "in the light of day, you probably don\u2019t and it\u2019s because it is an industry that has a certain reputation", "i thought there was a way to do it better", "i had the hypothesis that here i am, driven and succeeding in these environments, but totally uninspired", "there have to be other people like me", "what if i got them together, gave them permission to do it on my own terms", "that was slate", "i named my company slate on purpose \u2013 clean slate", "we were going to do it our way", "it was to go out and find a diamond in the rough, an asset that had been overlooked", "i love the category", "i love sexual medicine", "i\u2019m a card-carrying member of the sexual medicine society", "who knew there was that", "there is", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, there is", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it makes me popular at cocktail parties", "i whip it out", "no", "there really is a society", "it\u2019s because actually, our understanding there has really come much more recently", "it\u2019s a relatively new field", "yet, we\u2019re learning such interesting things", "it\u2019s in conditions that you might not lose your life from them, but you will lose your life as you know it when you\u2019re affected by these dysfunctions", "so, i found this inventor who had the only fda-approved long-acting testosterone.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 tim ferriss:\u00a0how do you find someone like that", "you would think in a world of pharma discovery that the bones would have been picked clean", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yes", "okay", "this is a great story", "a scientist that i knew from a previous company was quoted in an article", "this gentleman reached out to him", "he said, \u201ci don\u2019t know anything about this space, but i know somebody who\u2019s really interested in it.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0so, the inventor was looking for a way to commercialize", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it was a very fortuitous introduction", "i couldn\u2019t believe that this had been overlooked", "the reason it had been overlooked is that almost all of this product was being used off-label, meaning that not for its being indication", "it was being used, interestingly, in women", "so, my journey started very early in this use for libido", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what\u2019s the compound", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it was testosterone", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what type of testosterone", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it was a pellet", "so, it was long-acting, put under the surface of the skin, released testosterone over a four to six-month window", "tim ferriss:\u00a0wow", "okay.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, here\u2019s me looking at it going, \u201cfirst of all, it should be used by urologists in men.\u201d i did this crossover analyst", "only one urologist in the country was using it", "so, i thought this would be a great business to build", "frankly, the delivery system is better than what\u2019s available on the market today if i thought of something that was custom made for men", "i have big brothers", "i\u2019m used to being around guys", "they can be sitting on the beach burning bright red and they still won\u2019t be sunscreen on or rub something on", "the most common applications for testosterone at the time were gels", "tim ferriss:\u00a0gel, right", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, this was like, \u201chey, can you remember to show up three times a year to the doctor?\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0they\u2019re like, \u201csure, i can do that.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright", "the inventor reaches out to your friend, the scientist, who says, \u201ci can\u2019t help you but maybe my friend can.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s how it starts", "so, the pellet \u2013 i\u2019m thinking of, for instance, like trenbolone, which is used in cattle, in some cases, also popular with some power lifters and so on who do not use it in pellet form", "how is it administered or how is it put into the patient", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, it\u2019s put in in an in-office procedure", "at the end of it, it requires a band-aid", "so, there\u2019s a device, a trocar", "you go just under the surface of the skin, set it underneath the skin, put a band-aid on, and\u2026 tim ferriss:\u00a0off you go", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "for urologists or surgeons, this in-office procedure was very simple", "the great news is it was half the price of anything on the market", "so, everybody was winning in this equation", "tim ferriss:\u00a0why was it half the price", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0on purpose for me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0because you set the pricing", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i did, yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0was it less costly because you were comparing it to other modes of administration which require more visits, hence it\u2019s not \u2013 no", "it was just the market positioning", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0just the cost of the drug", "yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0fascinating", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i have a belief system around that in pharma around drug pricing", "so, it was important for me to do that", "we were making great money, building a great business, and we were doing just fine at that cost", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right", "you don\u2019t need a 500 million-percent markup", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0exactly", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yes", "as we may or may not talk about, some people get into a lot of trouble for that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0rightfully so", "yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what other questions do you like to ask when you\u2019re interviewing people", "are there any other questions that you find yield \u2013 or are worth the effort, that are particularly helpful or other approaches to hiring", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i\u2019m going to go back to silence", "i\u2019m going to go back to \u2013 i do more listening than asking", "i ask the one open-ended question and try to see where they\u2019ll take me", "i think i\u2019m getting a lot of insights into who they are by doing that", "i don\u2019t think there are magical questions", "i think there are ways to tease out cultural fit", "that is so important", "i care much less about the resume", "everybody wants to come in and impress you", "they haven\u2019t really hit your doorstep unless they have the cred, i think, to be in there interviewing for the position", "so, i feel like it\u2019s my job to really tease out that cultural fit so that we\u2019re both happy with each other", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, culture can mean a lot of things to different people", "in this particular case \u2013 you mentioned the adaptability, which in a small startup, especially, you\u2019re going to be wearing a lot of hats and those hats may change", "so, you need someone who\u2019s adaptable", "what else were you looking for and what did they mean to you", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0six things", "tim ferriss:\u00a0good", "there we go", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0mine are pretty specific", "let me say \u2013 overarching, i\u2019m looking for people who wake up every day and make deliberate choices", "it\u2019s all a choice how you go through life", "my six were they had to choose to be an owner", "they had to be highly motivated by that ownership", "they had to choose to be bold", "we were going to make decisions a little differently", "they had to choose to be quirky because i needed them to feel that permission to be individual in my environment", "most of them were coming out of environments in which we beat sameness into people and homogenize the whole group", "they had to choose to be learning", "that\u2019s fundamental to me even as i invest today", "it\u2019s so important to watch what people do to learn every day", "they had to choose to be family because we were going to be a small, tight-knit group", "and they had to choose to be appreciative", "i think that is how you go through life", "what is your attitude", "do you marvel at the opportunity you have to make impact", "so, those were my six choices i was looking for", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how do you avoid false positives in the sense that if you say to them, \u201cthese are the six values\u2026?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0oh, i never, never \u2013 you\u2019re listening to the story that, i think, exposes those values", "but if you ask somebody that, like, \u201cdo you choose to be quirky?\u201d \u201cuh, sure.\u201d you\u2019re not going to get, i think, the right response", "i think you have to know your core of who you are and who fits", "then i think you have to ask the questions", "i will say there is one other question i do always ask", "i ask, \u201chow is the very first way you ever made money?\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0i like that", "that\u2019s a really good one", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0if they can\u2019t tell me, \u201ci put flyers in the mailboxes in the neighborhood and said, \u2018odd jobs, call me,\u2019\u201d or if they are like, \u201cwell, my first job out of college was\u2026\u201d they\u2019re out", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they don\u2019t have that sort of mentality that\u2019s going to fit", "tim ferriss:\u00a0one of my friends, brian johnson, who has done a whole host of very impressive things, he was the founder \u2013 i don\u2019t think he had a cofounder \u2013 but let\u2019s just say one of the founders, to be safe, of braintree, which then sold for a whole lot of money", "when entrepreneurs come to him, because he invests quite a lot now, and they say they want to start something, he\u2019ll ask them, \u201cis that an itch or is it a burn?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0that\u2019s cool", "tim ferriss:\u00a0then he\u2019ll take them down that discussion to assess, \u201cdo you really have the stick-to-itiveness and the stubbornness and just the, \u2018it can\u2019t be any other way with me,\u2019 to actually make it through this?\u201d because it\u2019s not going to be all roses and kittens and sunshine", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0can i tell you a quirky story", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you can absolutely tell me a quirky story", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0this is how it went in an interview", "tim ferriss:\u00a0after you tell me one quirky story, i would like you to tell me a bold story from your personal experience", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0perfect", "okay", "here is my quirky \u2013 if i had asked for this, it wouldn\u2019t have come out", "but i am in an interview with a young woman who wants to come sell for me this testosterone product", "her brother had a particular genetic condition that meant that he didn\u2019t go through puberty normally", "so, they have to have testosterone replacement from a very young age", "nobody was more passionate about our product", "she had witnessed what it did for his life, what it did for her family, but she\u2019d never sold", "so, i was taking a big chance", "look, young, no sales experience, going to be walking into urology offices having a pretty sensitive conversation about men\u2019s sexual health and i\u2019m in the interview with her and i\u2019m going, \u201cwell, i\u2019m just kind of worried about\u2026\u201d and i didn\u2019t so much as get it out as she looked at me and she said, \u201cballs.\u201d i said, \u201cyou\u2019re hired.\u201d so, there was no doubt of recognition from me that this girl was quirky, that she was not going to have fear in the office", "maybe that\u2019s bold", "i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s bold or quirky", "i\u2019m going to call it both tim ferriss:\u00a0i think it\u2019s both", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it ultimately became her nickname in the office", "we called her duck balls", "tim ferriss:\u00a0duck balls", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah, because we had a whole other duck story", "tim ferriss:\u00a0wait, i\u2019ll take the bait \u2013 what\u2019s the duck", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0we called her ducky because she was always very calm on the surface, but like going like this a million miles an hour underneath", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "we\u2019re going to come back to the bold story", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah, that\u2019s fair", "tim ferriss:\u00a0first, i should just, as a public service announcement, say to those people out there who do not have common sense \u2013 don\u2019t just jump up and shout, \u201cballs,\u201d in every job interview because you think that\u2019s going to show how bold you are", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0fair enough", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and if you do and you don\u2019t get hired, shame on you", "in the course of doing some research, i believe \u2013 i don\u2019t think i\u2019m making this up \u2013 but you give everybody nicknames or a lot of your employees nicknames", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i do", "yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0why is that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it is my quirk", "i\u2019ve had it my whole life", "i know my mother by so many different names that i think people don\u2019t know who i\u2019m referring to half of the time that have known us for years", "i did it because we love to story tell", "we sit around the lunch table", "we have a discipline of having lunch together every single day", "that was an effort to \u2013 you know, no death by meeting", "how would we all be on the same page and still create this family spirit", "people get to telling stories and of course, it\u2019s the one you wish you hadn\u2019t told that ultimately arrives at your nickname", "but the beauty of that is we have a whole ceremony \u2013 a caricature, you get a nickname", "it\u2019s basically handed over at the lunch table", "you will never me known by your real name again", "tim ferriss:\u00a0wait a second \u2013 so, this is like the knighting by nickname", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it is", "tim ferriss:\u00a0at what point does this happen", "is it like your first week on the job", "is it like, \u201con friday, you\u2019re going to be\u2026?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0no", "we need a little more time than that, but probably a month in, it happens", "the caricature goes on the wall", "your name is sort of never to be heard again other than your nickname", "the reason i did it \u2013 it was important to me that i was giving permission in my environments \u2013 permission to be yourself, to show who that was", "especially when you\u2019re building companies where a lot of your people are outside of the main office or salespeople or other, it was a way for us to get to know one another", "it felt like, \u201coh, i get it", "i know who you are", "i\u2019ve heard your story.\u201d i think it created this culture of locked arms, us against the world", "we knew each other\u2019s quirks", "so, yeah, weird habit, but one that stays to today", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright", "if i may \u2013 this is going to lead somewhere, but i\u2019m a little sleep-deprived and on lots of caffeine", "so, i\u2019m just going to roll with it", "so, a friend of mine told me a joke recently", "i\u2019m not going to give the whole joke because it\u2019s kind of long, but this tourist goes to scotland", "he\u2019s sitting in a bar", "he\u2019s hanging out", "there\u2019s this old guy in the corner", "he starts like yelling at this tourist every couple of minutes", "he\u2019d be like, \u201chey, laddie, you see that pier out there", "i built it with me own hands", "what do they call me", "scotty the pier builder", "no.\u201d he keeps doing this", "this guy\u2019s like, \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d he goes on and on and on", "he goes, \u201cbut laddie, i fuck one goat and what do they call me?\u201d so, the point being do people have the ability to veto their nickname", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely not", "who gets to request their own nickname", "that never works", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s true", "that\u2019s not going to work", "just to give examples, you have duck balls", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i do.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 tim ferriss:\u00a0what are some other examples", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i have a guy named spoon, which was born out of a story of this incredible bromance between him and another guy", "they\u2019re still great friends to this day", "they so loved each other in their sales training that we said that all that was missing was them spooning", "but i\u2019ll give an example of how that story and that nickname stuck with the whole group", "actually, this guy got cancer, one of my reps, and a pretty dismal diagnosis", "it was one of the other reps who came forward and said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to do a virtual get well spoon card.\u201d so, every single person in the company had the spoon hanging on the end of their nose and sent it out", "it was their kids and it was their dogs and it was their family", "i think that it didn\u2019t come from me", "that came from somebody else in the organization", "that\u2019s how as much as we teased him about it, in that really important moment, he knew we were all looking out for him", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, this makes me think of a few things", "\u00a0i really would love your thoughts on, of course, everything i\u2019m asking you, otherwise why would i ask you in the first place", "but this type of joking around, i think, is a really, from what i\u2019ve seen, a really critical ingredient in almost any tight-knit group that does big things", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0sure", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019ve also spoken with a controversial guy for a bunch of reasons, but jim watson, co-discoverer of the double helix", "that story is also a little more complicated than we have time for right now", "he talked about how these small groups \u2013 my words, not his, but like dick and fart jokes are actually really important for like letting the air out of the tires and to facilitate the endurance that people are going to need to get through the emotional hurdles", "so, my question is like duck balls, clearly not the most politically correct nickname, right", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0 fair", "yes", "tim ferriss:\u00a0but that\u2019s kind of why it works, right", "so, my question is in today\u2019s times where, yes, there are horrible things that do happen in offices and terrible misbehavior at the same time, this type of nicknaming and so on, i think, is really helpful", "so, how do you \u2013 what would your advice be to people that are like, \u201cyeah, i want that, we need that,\u201d but they\u2019re afraid", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0well, look, i think you know \u2013 it\u2019s that laying my cards on the table", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0when you first came in an interview with me, \u201chere\u2019s who we are.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0right", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019ll hate us in six months if you don\u2019t like this, this, and this.\u201d i think that transparency from me of who we were and what the environment was like \u2013 and look, we never were offensive", "there was such an underlying affection for one another", "but it gave us permission to have what i\u2019ll call constructive irreverence", "irreverence with me too \u2013 they gave me a nickname", "we knew that we could have that comfortably inside of our environment and all be on the same page when we walked out into the world", "i think it\u2019s really important", "i think that not taking yourself to seriously, i think being self-deprecating \u2013 when i talk to a lot of female founders who are very frustrated by the injustices and this or that, i say, \u201cthe best piece of advice i could have for you is perfect your sense of humor along the way,\u201d because when it is something that is offensive, the best way for you to cut through that is with humor", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, for sure", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it is the best way", "actually, the person on the other side might take a step back and think, \u201coh god, did i just do that?\u201d but you\u2019ve given them room to sort of ask for forgiveness in that", "i think humor is really important", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "it also gives \u2013 this is having spent a lot of time in japan and china also, where in china, [inaudible] [00:29:58] is like to lose face", "you\u2019re giving someone the chance to also kind of recover form a stumble instead of creating what could be a really longstanding, kind of awkwardness intention", "do you have a nickname", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i do", "it\u2019s hbic", "tim ferriss:\u00a0were you allowed to come up with your own nickname", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely not", "they tell me that the b stands for betty, but i\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re lying", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what does the whole thing stand for", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0head betty in charge", "tim ferriss:\u00a0who gave you that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0there\u2019s always a secret nicknaming committee", "it\u2019s never revealed", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i see", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it just came to the table one day", "it was written on my caricature", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m just going all over the place, but that\u2019s what i do", "you mentioned new sales rep, balls, and then henceforth, you will forever be known as duck balls", "we\u2019re not going to keep going on duck balls", "i just like saying it", "that\u2019s six or seven", "but the sales position is a really important position", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0really important position", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s like everything is a whole lot of talk until something gets sold, ultimately, right", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you train", "what were some of the techniques that worked really well for either of your products for selling", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "i think that the best approach was that i gave them permission to fire the d-list", "in sales, particularly in pharma sales, you get on this like, \u201cevery two weeks, this is my routing", "i\u2019m going to go out \u2013 reach and frequency, reach and frequency.\u201d i think that it says to keep chasing your tail in situations in which you\u2019re never going to pull it through", "so, it\u2019s rare, i think, to say to a salesperson, \u201cyou know what", "scope it out", "move on", "fire them", "wait until they call you back and they\u2019re looking for the product and really focus your energy on those who are raising their hand quickly.\u201d so, i think that was different, at least in my industry", "i don\u2019t think that\u2019s counterintuitive at all to selling, but it certainly is in the traditional pharma approach", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how is first contact made", "is it walk in the door, brush the feet on the carpet, \u201ci\u2019m here to see dr", "so-and-so?\u201d or is it an email", "what does the first contact look like with a prospect", "who is the prospect", "what\u2019s the right approach", "what\u2019s the right pitch", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0hit the front line of the office and you\u2019re actually dealing with the receptionist that you need to talk to to see the physician, the nurse, etc", "so, you\u2019re going through all of those different steps to get to them", "our group was helping in an in-office procedure", "i think they were highly valued for what they could do in the office", "they walked in in scrubs", "it was different", "they sort of walked right to the back of the room", "so, i think that it was them knowing that they\u2019re bringing something of value", "i think in sales, you can feel like the one that is the pain in the ass, that people are saying, \u201cyou, go, you\u2019re just taking time in my day.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0i think they had enough confidence in what they were bringing that they didn\u2019t accept that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right", "it wasn\u2019t \u201cdeath of a salesman.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0it wasn\u2019t", "exactly", "with that product, we had this incredible opportunity", "so, what happens today", "you get a drug", "you get it filled at a pharmacy", "you probably have no idea who the drug manufacturer is", "with that product, because it was done in office, we had this incredible opportunity to own that relationship with the physician", "so, i looked around and i\u2019m like, \u201cokay, who in pharma does well with customer service", "oh, nobody", "okay", "so, what are we going to do?\u201d i took my entire leadership team to zappos and we learned from them", "we were constantly looking outside of our industry for who was doing it great", "so, here\u2019s a story", "our most important guide, sort of the top researcher in the country is from harvard", "he did a lot of the early days testosterone research", "he did that research on lizards", "when he would buy our product, we\u2019d put a plastic lizard in his box, wouldn\u2019t say anything, just drop one in his box", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0we were trying to see what would happen", "i went to visit him several months later", "i walk in \u2013 can\u2019t get more ivory tower", "i\u2019m in harvard", "he\u2019s got this beautiful mahogany bookcase \u2013 second shelf, all of our lizards", "it made a difference", "it was that quirky \u2013 so, i think our salespeople were always \u2013just like we listened to each other for what our stories were, they really listened closely and celebrated that in the customer", "not what you\u2019d you think from a pharma company, huh", "tim ferriss:\u00a0no, it\u2019s not", "what other companies did you borrow from or look at", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0wow",

went to seattle", "i love seattle", "i used to live there", "we went to the pike place market, spent an hour, just went out and learned from those businesses", "we were learning from beecher\u2019s, the cheese shop", "what do they do exceptionally well", "how do they invite people into the experience", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, zappos was probably our most formal \u2013 go together, learn from them", "but constantly reading or picking those businesses that we loved, that was a constant conversation at the lunch table", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if you were \u2013 this could be, let\u2019s just say freshman year of high school, freshman year of college \u2013 teaching an entrepreneurship class, but the only way you could teach it is by recommending books and exercises or practices, are there any particular books that come to mind that you would insist they read or any particular practices or exercises that you would have people do", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i would insist that they read \u201cpurple cow.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0\u201cpurple cow?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0mr", "godin", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0right", "yeah", "i would insist that they read it about how you stand out in a sea of sameness", "that\u2019s it", "i think in terms of sales, for sure, or for entrepreneurship, how do you stand out", "what is going to be your defining difference and how do you sort of attract remarkable to you if you\u2019re doing something truly remarkable", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i don\u2019t think it\u2019s one-size-fits-all", "that would be my ask", "i think that i would tell every entrepreneur go sell something", "if they\u2019ve never sold anything, go learn from somebody", "go be in their sales organization and then take it back to your company", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, there\u2019s a fellow austinite here named noah kagan who recommends \u2013 one of his exercises that he suggests to everybody is the coffee challenge", "the coffee challenge is just getting more comfortable with discomfort by for the next, say, week, every day, you have to go into a coffee shop \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s starbucks, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s mom and pop \u2013 and asking for 10 percent off your coffee when you get to the checkout", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i love that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0he\u2019s the first one to say the outcome does not matter", "you just have to ask", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0okay", "i love that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you can\u2019t say you\u2019re doing an experiment", "you can\u2019t make them more comfortable with it", "you just have to ask for a discount", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0thank you, noah", "i\u2019m going to be applying that now", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s really valuable", "i was

customers yet", "i mentioned this to him and he\u2019s like, \u201ci don\u2019t need that because i make myself uncomfortable in all of these following ways.\u201d i was like, \u201cwell, why don\u2019t you just do it", "send me a photograph of the receipt, whether you get a discount or not.\u201d he\u2019s young enough that we have somewhat of a mentor/mentee relationship", "he\u2019s like, \u201cthat\u2019s ridiculous", "i don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d i was like, \u201cwell, prove it to me", "if you don\u2019t need to do it, you\u2019re going to get coffee or tea or water",

a text a few days later", "he\u2019s like, \u201coh my god, i had to walk around the block psyching myself up to do this", "my palms were sweating.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0really", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u201cand i got 10 percent off, but it was so much harder \u2013 it brought up all of these emotions i didn\u2019t expect to come up.\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cthat\u2019s right",

nicely to what i promised i would come back to, which is boldness", "what are some events or inflection points for you, maybe \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 but any stories of you choosing boldness", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0well, i\u2019ll tell you probably my boldest choice was when i made a decision to dispute the fda", "i was on this course \u2013 it\u2019s pretty straightforward", "you have a pre-specified endpoint", "you go out and do the studies", "you meet them with statistical significance", "you get to an approval, provided there are no show-stoppers", "so, i had gone out", "i\u2019d gotten this drug from the company that first developed it", "i had sat down with the fda, \u201cwhat do i need to do?\u201d we had agreed", "i had gone out", "i had done the work", "i had gotten the outcomes", "we got rejected", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what was the drug", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0this was addyi", "tim ferriss:\u00a0a-d-d-y-i", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, at that moment, it was crippling for my business", "we had done the work", "we had done all the right things scientifically and yet we got to a no", "i was faced with turning back to shareholders and saying, \u201cthis is going to be this many million more dollars.\u201d at that time, i was lucky", "a woman reached out to me", "people knew we were on this journey", "tim ferriss:\u00a0just for context for people listening, this is your second company", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it is, sprout pharmaceuticals", "tim ferriss:\u00a0dubbed by the media, the product, at least, as female viagra, just for people who are trying to keep track", "okay", "please continue", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, people knew that we were going down this path", "i think that it was so fortuitous that she reached out to me at this moment and said, \u201cdon\u2019t give up", "i was on the drug in the research trials", "i want to share my story with you.\u201d she lived outside of dc", "i was in dc all the time.\u00a0 i went to have a coffee with her", "she walked into the room and this woman was in charge \u2013 type a, recognized her right away", "she walked over", "she had her own business", "she had raised two beautiful boys", "she had what looked like the perfect marriage by all of our normal standards", "she said, \u201ci have succeeded in every aspect of my life other than this", "i\u2019m waiting every day for my husband to ask me for a divorce.\u201d and i\u2019m looking at this woman and i thought \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0because of their sex life or lack thereof", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "she had no interest", "she had been diagnosed with this condition", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what is the condition", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it\u2019s called hypoactive sexual desire disorder", "hsdd is the moniker", "same prevalence as ed has for men \u2013 so, ed is the most common male sexual dysfunction", "hsdd is women\u2019s most common", "it\u2019s a lack of interest in having sex", "tim ferriss:\u00a0physiologically, how does that manifest", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, in order to respond to sexual stimuli, you need the right balance of key chemicals in the brain", "your excitement factors and your inhibition factors need to come into play", "for some subset of women, they go out of whack", "they become imbalanced", "it\u2019s how addyi works", "it works on the restoration of those key chemicals", "and we know it from these brain scan studies", "so, a woman who has this condition with the normal ebb and flow of desire for sex, put them in an mri, show them sexual cues, their brains light up, actually, totally differently", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what are the chemicals", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0 dopamine and serotonin", "so, our excitatory factors have a transient negative effect on serotonin, which is an inhibitor for your sexual response", "tim ferriss:\u00a0say that one more time", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0serotonin", "so, dopamine is positive, excitement for sex", "serotonin is inhibition", "the drug worked by this transient negative effect", "so, a negative effect on a negative for sex equaled a pro-sexual effect", "tim ferriss:\u00a0got it", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m just trying to think", "okay", "so, it would be\u2026 got it", "so, serotonin has an inhibitory effect", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0what do we know of the antidepressants", "their most common side effect is actually killing your sex drive", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, interestingly, as drugs are often discovered, this drug was looked at for its effect on depression", "what you do when you\u2019re testing those drugs is you actually have to administer a scale to see, \u201chow much am i killing their sex drive?\u201d in this particular drug\u2019s case, it all went the other direction", "it had a pro-sexual effect", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, wow", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, at that time, all of the study changed to look at this condition, specifically", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i don\u2019t know if this is due to the tracking", "there\u2019s some maybe folklore in this genesis story, but viagra, same story", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah, same", "absolutely", "blood pressure medication, low and behold, a very interesting side effect", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so the folklore goes \u2013 i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true \u2013 but the male subject would not give the medication back", "they\u2019re like, \u201chey, this doesn\u2019t work for blood pressure", "give us our supplies back.\u201d they were like, \u201cno, we want to keep them.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0very interestingly, when i got to addyi, i had built this great company for men", "i was in this community", "the company that innovated this drug originally was going to put it on the shelf", "they were going to walk away from it", "one of the great researchers in the field went out to women who w ere in the trials and said, \u201ci need you to come in and bring your medication with you", "we\u2019re going to have a normal meeting.\u201d he was actually delivering the news that they were killing it, that they were killing the development trial", "he filmed it and the women were like this, giving their drug back \u2013 hands shaking, crying", "he said, \u201cyou need to do something about this.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0two questions \u2013 why were they going to shelf it", "when you say got the drug \u2013 there\u2019s a good amount of discussion and deal making that goes into that", "how does one get a drug", "if you don\u2019t mind discussing it, what does a typical deal structure look like for something like that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0mine was very atypical", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, then let\u2019s talk about both typical and atypical", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0okay, happy", "first, let me tell you just about how we got the drug", "lucky for me, i think i built a reputation in this field that the key researchers in it knew that i cared deeply about women having access to medicine", "at the time, there were 26 fda-approved drugs for some form of male sexual dysfunction and not a single one for women", "you asked why that company would put it on the shelf", "it was very clear to me that it wasn\u2019t on the basis of science", "actually, the scientific understanding is spectacular", "we\u2019ve come a long way recently in terms of this understanding", "it was on the basis of the societal narrative", "boy, if you say women and sex, people have an opinion", "it\u2019s not like developing a diabetes medication", "unless you\u2019re diabetic, you probably don\u2019t care", "develop something for sex, we all have a point of view", "i think that it was a conservative company", "they said, \u201cwe\u2019re not getting into this", "we\u2019re not going to get into this entire discussion.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "so, was it a larger company developing multiple drugs", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0large german", "i like to tease", "i said, \u201cit\u2019s sex", "we\u2019re german", "we\u2019re out.\u201d that helps actually promote the understanding", "but you have to appreciate cultures inside of companies, certain categories that they\u2019re in", "this would have been paving a new frontier for them", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you find this", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i was watching all of this research being presented at the scientific meetings i went to at the sexual medicine society meetings and really just cheering it on from the sidelines as a woman, like, \u201cfinally, we\u2019re going to have one for women.\u201d then they walked away", "i watched a clinical community go from all of this excitement to this true sadness in delivering this message to women", "so, i spent a year just listening to women", "after i did that, i sold off my company for men and took this on", "but when i did that, i went to this company", "i think it was with thanks to the fact that the clinical community, the experts in the field were so supportive of me that they gave me the shot", "so, they gave me the drug", "i didn\u2019t pay for it upfront", "they won", "i win, they win", "they had a royalty in the case that i finally got it to market and in a success scenario", "but it was a bold move for them", "they\u2019d never done a deal like this before", "i think they bet on me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you convince them", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i don\u2019t know that i convinced them as much as those who had watched me build slate and saw who i was and what i really cared about", "i really cared about women having access to this", "women with a medical condition deserved access to a medical treatment, not any of our value judgements on whether or not they needed it or the worthiness of treatment, but just purely the science had spoken and we needed to listen", "i think they knew that was my definition of success", "i wasn\u2019t in this to create the next blockbuster drug", "i was in it to make sure to make sure that women had access", "then they got to choose for themselves", "tim ferriss:\u00a0did you first deliver that message via email, in person", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0in person", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you get them in person for it, a conference", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0again, thankfully, this kind of key researcher reached out to them and said, \u201cyou need to meet with her.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0\u201ci think she can get this done.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0got it", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0 he wanted me to get it done, i think, for women", "he was, by the way, the principal investigator on the viagra trials", "so, he got viagra approved for men", "he would have to tell this story, but in my mind, the story goes he did that and he was like, \u201cokay, fixed, guys, moving on to women.\u201d he\u2019s actually spent almost all of his years since then just working on women and researching", "tim ferriss:\u00a0no kidding", "what\u2019s his name", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0dr", "irwin goldstein", "tim ferriss:\u00a0irwin goldstein", "good for dr", "goldstein", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i know", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if you don\u2019t mind me asking, if we can\u2019t get into the particulars, it\u2019s fine, but i\u2019m just so fascinated by this stuff \u2013 in publishing, for instance, books, my world, typical royalties would range from, say, 12 to 15 percent for a hardcover", "keeping in mind we\u2019re talking about books", "so, the margins are very different, i\u2019m sure", "then there are fairly typical advance ranges for certain types of books, advance on royalties than there are typical royalty rates", "there\u2019s very little deviation in the traditional deals, which are still very, very common and certainly predominant", "what does that look like in pharma, broadly speaking", "we don\u2019t have to talk about your deals, necessarily", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0pharma typically, if you had this type of discovery, you would go out and shop it", "if you as an organization decided, \u201cnot a fit, not a fit in our key areas of focus,\u201d or whatever, you\u2019d put it out there to auction, people would bid", "they would be buying it on the basis or sort of a projected ultimate kind of peak sales", "so, ours was so different i don\u2019t think the royalties look all too different than as you describe, but it was really a very unusual deal", "usually, you\u2019re buying it for a healthy upfront that is anticipating peak sales", "tim ferriss:\u00a0got it", "is that an advance on royalties, just like books, where you\u2019re getting pre-paid for the anticipated sales", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0that\u2019s making a big bet", "that\u2019s somebody coming in and betting on that future for it", "so, i buy it", "you go away", "it\u2019s mine now to further the development", "so, we had interesting \u2013 i can\u2019t say it was a partnership", "they just ultimately got a check if i was successful", "maybe i even surprised them", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you get it through the fda", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0well, i was talking about that moment of boldness of the rejection and that decision to fight them", "i was fighting them because i had 11,000 women worth of data", "that\u2019s why i was fighting them", "i knew that the science had spoken", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s also a large sample size compared to, i\u2019m sure, a lot of the other 26", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0extraordinary", "so, we\u2019re talking in the 700 to 800 patient range, vis-\u00e0-vis ours.\u00a0 viagra were big trials, 4,000, but we were several factors higher than that and a very different path", "so, i think ultimately, i won on the science", "but what had to happen is we had to listen to women", "i think in categories where we have natural unconscious bias \u2013 we\u2019ll call it unconscious \u2013 conscious-unconscious bias, you really do have to spend time with the people who are affected by it", "so, even if you look at things like aids, it took the patient voice for us to really appreciate what needed to happen", "our job as a drug company is to characterize the benefits and the risks with great rigor in trials", "ultimately, the fda\u2019s job is to protect patient safety if there is a show-stopper in there", "but otherwise, it is to turn that decision over to patients and the providers", "because of, again, i think all of the feelings we have about sex, i was told all the time \u2013 i said this earlier \u2013 \u201ccindy, why are you such a crusader in this", "nobody\u2019s going to lose their life from this.\u201d what i said is, \u201cgo spend time with these women", "they\u2019re losing their life as they know it.\u201d it\u2019s breaking up their marriages", "it\u2019s affecting how they feel about themselves", "our sex is a lot of how we show up in the world, our moxie", "if it breaks down in the bedroom, it is breaking down over the breakfast table", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, absolutely", "i might be butchering this, but i\u2019ve read you quoted as saying something along the lines of in sexual dysfunction in males, we assume it\u2019s biological and in sexual dysfunction in women, we assume it\u2019s psychological, or not we but most people", "not we, but most people", "you certainly don\u2019t, but many people in society do", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0in society at large, for sure, we absolutely do", "we sort of pat them on the shoulder", "when is at with this woman outside of dc and she told me she succeeded in every aspect of her life other than this, i saw the portrait of a woman who turned on herself, like, \u201coh, if only i bought sexier lingerie, if only i read \u201950 shades of grey.\u2019\u201d when i saw that, i said to her, \u201chey, mind if i show you something?\u201d i popped open by macbook, i started showing her, geeking out showing these brain scans", "i turned to her and she\u2019s crying", "i thought, \u201cthis is why i\u2019m going to do it", "it\u2019s the validation that this is real", "it\u2019s not just in her head.\u201d that really was a defining moment for when i said, \u201ci\u2019m going to fight the fda.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0so, tactically speaking, now you have the motivation", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "how do you do it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do you do", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it is, actually, a path available to drug manufacturers", "i like to call it the road less traveled to take them on", "but it was a path in which to their credit, what happened was a lot of public conversation", "so, they opened their doors", "they invited in women who have the condition", "they asked them a number of questions so they could have a better understanding for impact, for how they would define success", "then ultimately, they asked us to do additional work along the way and they assembled a body of scientific experts to vote yes or no", "it\u2019s an incredible process", "so, talk about the nerves in the room", "i went in this day", "it was a panel of 24", "tim ferriss:\u00a0is there a name for this alternative path", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it\u2019s a dispute resolution path", "then there\u2019s something called an advisory committee, which is the fda can go out, assemble experts", "you almost go on trial", "they read all of your data", "they get to ask you, the company, questions", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they get to ask the fda questions", "then the public gets to speak at the microphone", "on that day, by the press of a button they vote", "would they approve it or not based on everything", "i remember looking at the screen and my hand shaking with my phone and they overwhelmingly voted to approve it", "again, science won", "it had always given us the answer, but we just had to listen to women to, i think, listen to what the data was telling us", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what were their objections with the initial rocky territory that you then had to overcome via the dispute resolution", "you don\u2019t have to get into it", "i\u2019m just curious", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i think it was just additional study, additional study", "we are very protective of women in the process", "i think what we have to be careful of is that we don\u2019t become paternalistic in terms of being so protective of women that we are not allowing them to have choice", "here\u2019s why i say it", "26 times we had looked at data sets for men that had benefits and risks \u2013 make no mistake, all drugs had benefits and risks", "and we had said, \u201cokay.\u201d and we turned over the decision to the guy and his provider", "we were being protective to the point of not just characterizing those benefits and those risks, giving women that information and letting them make the decision for themselves", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, part of the reason that i\u2019m asking, we definitely don\u2019t need to get into this right now", "even though it\u2019s called the tim ferriss show, it\u2019s not me being interviewed, so i\u2019ll try not to be long-winded", "part of the reason i\u2019m so fascinated by this is i am in the process of doing my best to help get both mdma and [inaudible] [00:54:40] through phase ii trials", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0oh, yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0very much top of mind to me", "fortunately, mdma was recently designated or received breakthrough therapy designation", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0awesome", "tim ferriss:\u00a0which is fantastic", "the results with ptsd are truly astonishing", "the magnitude of effect is just so incredible", "it\u2019s like 22 percent efficacy psychotherapy alone, 72 percent efficacy \u2013 of course, you have to look at how that\u2019s measured, but with the aid of just a handful of sessions", "in any case, that\u2019s part of the reason why i\u2019m digging so much", "it\u2019s very much of great interest", "okay", "where to go next", "so, you\u2019ve sold two companies, at least", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yes, i have", "tim ferriss:\u00a0to an entrepreneur who is someday thinking of selling a company or in the midst of maybe on the cusp of trying to sell a company, what advice would you give them", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0the first is be prepared that if you sell it, it is both exhilarating and excruciating", "i think you don\u2019t anticipate that", "it\u2019s the, \u201cisn\u2019t there the billion-dollar happy ending?\u201d i think you lose a big piece of who you are in that moment and that\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to wrestle with", "so, that\u2019s in a success scenario", "but as you prepare for it, i think only do it if you believe it makes good on the mission that you hold dear", "have a real sense of, \u201cthis is my baby,\u201d but in the hands of an adoptive parent, it\u2019s going to go to the next level", "when you do that deal, make sure you have safeguards that they really will raise that child you want them to", "i\u2019ll tell you a lesson learned for me", "i sold my first company", "typically, when you sell a company, it\u2019s structured transaction", "you get an upfront payment and then hopefully, you participate in the success down the road", "certainly, that\u2019s good for your shareholders", "the first time i sold, it was a best efforts clause", "best efforts can hide a multitude of sins", "tim ferriss:\u00a0describe a best efforts clause", "this is really important", "so, everybody should listen very, very closely", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0if you\u2019re going to participate together downstream, you don\u2019t want somebody to say, \u201chey, i\u2019m going to make my best effort to have this work.\u201d you better have some definition around that", "i did that the first time and i had pain when they were deprioritizing it, when they didn\u2019t have enough sales people on the product", "so, lesson learned", "when i went in to selling sprout, i had real rigor around the definition of performance obligations \u2013 you will have this many salespeople, you will spend this much money on marketing, you\u2019ll make this commitment in terms of disease state education", "what that ultimately meant for me is the opportunity when they didn\u2019t do it to get the product back", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "we\u2019ll definitely get to that", "this best efforts is really important", "i want to just emphasize it", "it\u2019s certainly been said that the man and woman who acts as their own lawyer has an idiot for a client, something like that", "so, unless you\u2019re trained as a lawyer, get proper legal advice, please", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely", "on that point, don\u2019t worry as much about the bank", "people are always saying, \u201cwho did you use", "what is the bank?\u201d worry about your transaction attorneys because of how you write these contracts", "in any structured transaction, they are your most important asset", "tim ferriss:\u00a0absolutely", "this is important in so many different types of contracts, whether, for instance, i\u2019ve run into this quite a lot in many of my contracts \u2013 publishing, television", "if you are a product developer or inventor and you want to license something for a royalty, you only get a percentage of what is sold and what happens if they decide it\u2019s not a priority", "do you have an out", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0well, how scary is it to think that somebody might take it on and kill it", "competitors wanting to own the market \u2013 often, you\u2019re bought by somebody who has products in the category", "what if they\u2019re buying you and they\u2019re going to kill your product", "tim ferriss:\u00a0absolutely", "or doing a fishing expedition to determine how they can kills you or steal your employees \u2013 super common", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, you talked about the second company", "what are some other pieces of advice for people thinking of selling a company or in the process of selling a company", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0 i was selling it early", "so, from that point, at least in my case, it was actually having the full plan to go it alone", "i couldn\u2019t count on, \u201chey, this really needs to be in the hand of somebody who could march it across the globe.\u201d i needed the plan of going it alone if they never showed up", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do you mean by that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0meaning i had the plan to launch it myself, the ability to hire", "i was capitalized to do all of those things, like never go into a negotiation running out of money in the bank because you think you\u2019re going to sell this grand idea that could be realized in the hands of somebody bigger than you", "i think that\u2019s a huge mistake", "i watch a lot of people do that thinking they\u2019re going to sell it then", "in fact, if you want to command the highest price, you better have that ability to say, \u201cbye", "i\u2019m doing it myself", "see you", "i know you want it", "i\u2019m going to do it myself.\u201d i think people sometimes mess that piece up", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, for sure", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they go in on skids", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "if you don\u2019t have alternatives, it does not matter how great a wordsmith you are with your negotiating", "if the other side knows that you are shit out of luck, you are fucked", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0could you pull some jedi mind trick", "yeah, maybe", "i was given advice a long time ago because i\u2019ve just negotiated so many types of deals", "i\u2019ll come back to why that doesn\u2019t actually conflict with lawyer advice that i just gave", "but the piece of advice that comes to mind that i was given at one point was this expert, master negotiator, done a lot of business development and bought and sold companies, just dozens and dozens of times, he said to me, \u201che who cares the least wins.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "absolutely", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s like the person who has like, \u201ctake it or leave it.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely", "that\u2019s true", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i think some advice that i remember in the fundraising world, which is slightly different \u2013 but actually, we should talk about fundraising too \u2013 it was, \u201cif you want money, ask for advice", "if you want advice, ask for money.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0actually, the reason i said, just for people listening, that the negotiating deals does not conflict with the get a good lawyer is that \u2013 i\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this, but lawyers are really, really critically important", "i work with a ton of lawyers for a ton of different things", "however, you have to recognize, like really study the incentives and how lawyers are rewarded and how they are punished", "if you want to be very business-forward and not play defense, it is often times very, very helpful and certainly cheaper to spec out the basic terms of engagement and maybe along the lines \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be a letter of intent \u2013 but have the basic range of what numbers could look like so that you can disqualify a deal before you pay lawyers to put 20 hours in at $1,500.00 an hour", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0no question", "i totally agree with that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, the second company, sprout \u2013 hurrah, hurrah, you get the fda approval", "before i get to my real question, i\u2019ll give a real question, which i guess i just smaller \u2013 what did you guys do to celebrate", "did you do anything to celebrate", "how did you feel", "button, button, button, button, holy shit", "in that moment, when you first realized what had happened, how did you feel", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, i have to tell you, it wasn\u2019t at the moment of sale", "it was the moment we won that advisory committee", "what we did was \u2013 my team, they were blood, sweat, and tears true to the cause", "they prepared so hard for this day", "i actually threw a victory party the night before", "i can remember the chairman of my board came up and said, \u201cwow, cindy.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0hold on a second \u2013 the night before you got the news on the advisory committee", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0oh, yeah, because i thought \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0because you were waiting \u2013 you were like, \u201calright, we\u2019re going to get the results tomorrow?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0yes", "i thought, \u201cwin or lose, we will have given this all", "we will have taken it to the mat.\u201d i needed the team to go in with that", "they had won the night before, before we ever got to the outcome", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s really smart", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i can remember the chairman of my board came over and he said \u2013 he\u2019s a brit \u2013 like, \u201ccindy, i\u2019m not sure i\u2019ve ever seen this before, but i\u2019m questioning this one right now, but i\u2019m going to go with it.\u201d i think that was really important", "we celebrated the victory of having gotten it to there and really having cared", "when we sold the company, i think that was the whirlwind", "there was a lot of emotion with it", "i woke up the next day", "i\u2019m the same person", "i\u2019ve still go to go to work", "i\u2019ve still got to get it done", "i think people think they\u2019re some kind of remarkable transformation from one day to the next and i think, actually, it\u2019s often a little bit of sadness", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, yeah", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0having spent time with a lot of people who just have more money than they could ever spend or even in some cases give away before they die, it rarely fixes as many things as you would hope", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0no question", "the day of the approval, i will say we waited", "what we knew is that the day we wanted the outcome just informs the fda decision", "so, it wasn\u2019t the day that we got the approval", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i see", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, they take their information in", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s one factor", "okay", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they get to go back, deliberate, and ultimately, the fda comes forward with their decision and you wait", "they actually send it to you late in the day", "so, the entire company was in", "we were all standing around, pink balloons everywhere waiting for a victory", "what was actually so sweet about this is that all the other companies on the same floor \u2013 we were on the tenth floor of a building \u2013 i used to say we could almost entirely fit in an elevator and we were going to change the conversation about women and sex forever \u2013 they waited too", "they stayed", "i can remember them showing up and it was 7:00 at night and they were like, \u201coh, my god, how are you guys doing", "is it okay", "are you not going to get the approval?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, that was fun that so many people \u2013 i was so lucky that as small as we were, we had this extraordinary group cheering us on", "we had this incredible bench", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, as the fearless leader, you didn\u2019t know what the verdict was going to be", "you had high hopes", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0sure", "tim ferriss:\u00a0did you have anything prepared \u2013 what were you going to do if it came back a no", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0celebrate that we did it all", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what were you going to say to the troops or if you had to imagine, if you can\u2019t remember what you would have said", "did you even think about it, really", "what would you have said", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i didn\u2019t imagine a scenario in which we wouldn\u2019t win", "the reason is i really thought that at the end of the day, we all had the capacity to get out of our own way, get beyond our own bias and look at the data", "i think that in particular \u2013 look, i think that part of the characteristic of female leaders i love is a certain empathy", "i felt like that data informed through a lens of empathy of having like walked a mile in the shoes of these women and now, we have all listened to them", "i believed we would get there", "i really did", "what i would have said to the team had we lost is i would have said, \u201ci\u2019m proud of you for putting it all in and for caring that deeply to see it all the way through.\u201d it was grueling work and long hours and a lot of punches in the face to get there", "tim ferriss:\u00a0welcome to entrepreneurship", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0exactly", "that\u2019s right", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you\u2019re going to conquer the world, huh", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i will tell you, i have to go back to \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0do you have a mouthguard", "good", "you\u2019re going to need that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i\u2019m going back to your story for the people thinking about selling", "be a little bit reluctant to give it up", "it\u2019s your point about who \u2013 he or she who cares the least \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0he who cares the least wins, yeah", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0when we went into our first negotiation with the company that ultimately bought it, we went into the room", "they made an offer", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they said, \u201cwere going to walk out of the room.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m sorry", "say this one more time", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, the company that was offering to purchase us, we went to this room", "they were very excited", "tim ferriss:\u00a0this is the second company", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0this is for sprout", "yes", "tim ferriss:\u00a0we go into the room", "companies come courting", "they want to buy us", "they throw an offer down", "they said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to let you guys think about that,\u201d and leave the room", "one of the things i had done is i had prepared binders of all of our data, of all of our research, and it was huge", "we brought him into the room and sat them down for effect", "they left the room and i looked around at my team and i said, \u201cokay, when i walk back in, within five minutes, we\u2019re going to all be out of our chairs and we\u2019re going to walk out of the room.\u201d they were like, \u201cwhat?\u201d so, they come back in the room and i said, \u201cthank you so much", "we\u2019re very flattered by that offer", "we\u2019re going to do it on our own.\u201d and as we got up, a woman who worked for me, she had all these binders sitting next to her", "she\u2019s looking at me like, \u201cshould i take the binders?\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cleave them.\u201d so, we walk out of the room", "sure enough, i knew they would call me back to get those binders", "so, they had a reason to reengage, which is, of course, \u201chey, cindy, we have these binders.\u201d i said, \u201cno, no, those are for you", "you can keep them.\u201d but they called back a little while later and said, \u201chey, we still have those binders we want to give back.\u201d so, the conversation continued", "that\u2019s negotiation, right", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0but it was a fun story", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, for people listening who are like, \u201coh, that\u2019s one in a million,\u201d no", "this shit works", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "a couple of thoughts for people listening \u2013 number one is there is a book called \u201cgetting to yes,\u201d \u201charvard negotiation project,\u201d etc", "i think \u201cgetting past no,\u201d which is another book written by one of the original coauthors is actually a little more realistic, where they talk about the batna, the best alternative to negotiated agreement", "you really need to think this through", "negotiation rewards those who come in prepared", "i remember at one point, i learned so much", "i mentioned i lived in china for a while", "it was in china where i really learned the flinch and realized, \u201cwow, you can actually improve so many deals just by letting someone negotiate against themselves.\u201d it\u2019s not like you\u2019re making a counter-offer", "if you try to buy anything, at the time i think it was just called silk ally in beijing, where you could by all the counterfeit jordan shoes and all this stuff, they would always start off like 10x what any rational person would pay if they ever lived in china", "then you would counter and they go\u2026 like you\u2019ve just \u2013 cindy whitehead:\u00a0offended them", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you\u2019ve clubbed their dog or something", "the emotion would come pouring out so exaggerated", "you would see these foreign exchange students immediately capitulate or reverse and be like, \u201ci\u2019m so sorry", "i don\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d and then they\u2019d walk off and you\u2019d just see these people laughing", "it\u2019s like the flinch or silence, letting the silence doing the work", "one that i encourage people to use \u2013 read the room, know the person across the table \u2013 but before you counter with anything, if you\u2019re not going to use silence, just saying something like, \u201cis this the best offer you guys can make", "is this the best you guys can do?\u201d don\u2019t be condescending about it, but just be like, \u201cjust so i\u2019m clear, is this the best you guys can offer?\u201d i would say depending on who you\u2019re dealing with, but the vast majority of the time, if it\u2019s not someone who\u2019s paid to negotiate, you\u2019re going to get something, but you have to be comfortable sitting in that silence", "so, once approved, my homework says \u2013 it could be inaccurate \u2013 three competing offers, is that right", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yes", "tim ferriss:\u00a0were those forthcoming", "were they inbound", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they were inbound", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "they were", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they were", "tim ferriss:\u00a0walk me through, then, how you, in a competition/auction environment, how do you make the most of that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0well, for me, i think the winner emerged not on the basis of the price but on the basis of willingness to keep my team", "that had been important to me when i sold my previous companies", "in both of my companies, it was really important what happened to the people who came to work for me", "so, that became one of the differentiators for me in the room, but no question when people know that others are interested, you do want that competitiveness because definitely it drives up the price and everything else", "that\u2019s how i reached my final decision", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what were some of the most important terms", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0for me", "it was that we were going to go the distance together, that it was still going to be realized, i think, on our terms, and that there was a real commitment to making it broadly affordably accessible to women, that they were going to march it across the globe", "i can pull this incidence data out of the us, out of brazil, out of the uk, wherever it may be, it\u2019s the same for women worldwide", "that factor of what became so attractive to me in this one company that came forward who bought us \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0can you\u2026", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it was valeant", "sure", "so, when valeant bought us, it was that they did this deliberately", "so, they had acquired a lot", "they were highly inquisitive", "they were a company with a lot of mckinsey folks and maybe fewer traditional operators", "their greatest criticism at that time \u2013 it has changed \u2013 but at that time it was really no organic growth", "so, i think they saw this product that had a lot of interest and an ability to prove it from scratch that they could grow it inside and they saw in me an operator who had been there, done that", "so, that deal structure was such that here, i could go out and run", "i had all of their resources, the ability to do it at a much bigger scale than i could have on my own, and i got to keep the team who cared so deeply that they got it to the finish line of approval", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and you had deliverables and measurables instead of best efforts", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u201cwe\u2019ll do our best.\u201d handshake", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely", "how many salespeople are we going to have", "tim ferriss:\u00a0thanks for the handshake, but my mama told me put it in writing", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0that\u2019s right", "exactly", "these weren\u2019t extraordinary", "they were sort of market standard for what is brand new category drug launch 101", "so, they were reasonable expectations", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, let\u2019s fast-forward \u2013 we can spend a lot of time on any segment of your story", "it\u2019s just so amazing", "this is not as \u2013 it\u2019s rare, but it does happen, like this kind of thing does happen and it\u2019s happened to a few of my friends in tech, actually, who have the opportunity to then take back their company or product or whatever it is that they\u2019ve sold", "so, what the hell happened", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0well, what happened is\u2026 tim ferriss:\u00a0first of all, if you\u2019re comfortable, i think it\u2019s public at this point \u2013 how much did sprout sell for", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0$1 billion upfront", "tim ferriss:\u00a0$1 billion", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0and we had a pretty impressive structure transaction on the backend", "tim ferriss:\u00a0like earnout/royalties", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0correct", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, tres commas, for you silicon valley fans", "then what unfolds", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i couldn\u2019t have written it for a movie", "i really couldn\u2019t have", "so, we got the drug approved in august", "everybody had come courting after that advisory committee meeting", "we announced our intention to sell and then it takes time for a deal to close", "so, in that interim time, i\u2019m just running", "i\u2019m building a salesforce", "i\u2019m getting ready for launch", "the deal is closing to full closure", "eleven days into our deal closing, the world basically went sideways for valeant", "if you follow pharma, you certainly know they were at about $260.00 a share the day they bought us", "they\u2019ve traded as low as $8.00 in the last two years", "it was just\u2026 tim ferriss:\u00a0for those people who don\u2019t know, why did that happen", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0accusation around drug pricing issues and also a non-disclosure of a pharmacy relationship that they hadn\u2019t disclosed", "so, it really just \u2013 it went kaboom", "it was so sad for me for all of these salespeople who had come to work for me", "they weren\u2019t in the field a week before this happened", "me being who i am, here\u2019s my baby", "we\u2019ve just gone out", "the world is collapsing higher up", "i\u2019m not getting information and i\u2019m screaming quite loudly", "i think that just didn\u2019t fit for them at that moment", "they had enough distraction", "they did not need cindy whitehead screaming as well", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u201chey, lady", "we have enough stress.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0i was invited to leave", "they called me and they said, \u201cit\u2019s clear you no longer want to be here,\u201d to which i\u2019m pretty sure my answer was, \u201clike hell.\u201d they said, \u201cwell, as it turns out, you are no longer going to be here.\u201d i have to tell you, at that moment, for me, founder, sometimes you have to go, \u201cyou know what", "i\u2019m the founder and maybe there will be a personality conflict", "they\u2019ve taken my baby", "they\u2019ve paid good money.\u201d so, in an effort, i think, to check myself, i thought, \u201ci need to step to the sidelines and cheer everybody on", "i need to be positive about this and optimistic that maybe with me removed it will be championed inside of the organization.\u201d certainly, i wanted to protect all of my people who were still there", "i think if i have one regret, it\u2019s that i didn\u2019t speak up then because what happened after i was gone is that they surely \u2013 i can\u2019t even say slowly but surely \u2013 pretty rapidly dismantled my whole organization and then everybody was gone", "tim ferriss:\u00a0now, there\u2019s more to the story", "there is", "because of those important performance obligations, i had an opportunity when they weren\u2019t meeting those to go back and open a different discussion with them that ultimately became the basis of a lawsuit", "in this time, they changed ceos", "we\u2019ve had a really positive \u2013 it became clear to me this was not going to be an area of focus", "again, remember, they had bought it very intentionally, but it was an outlier", "it was different than what they had normally done and they didn\u2019t quite have the infrastructure inside to put that focus into it", "so, i think what was starting off as a lawsuit to be able to get through the noise of everything they were going to ultimately became a discussion in, \u201cwhat\u2019s the win-win here", "nobody\u2019s winning", "we\u2019re not winning", "you\u2019re not winning", "women aren\u2019t winning.\u201d i think in exchange for dropping that lawsuit, they decided to give me the drug back", "tim ferriss:\u00a0a few things \u2013 so, in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, they decided to give you the drug back", "they did not charge you for the drug", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0correct", "they gave me a loan", "tim ferriss:\u00a0they gave you a $25 million loan to help you get started", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yes, they did", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and did you and other people who had equity in your company when it sold have to give back the $1 billion", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0we did not", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s a good deal", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it\u2019s a good deal", "we\u2019re pretty happy with it", "but let me tell you \u2013 for my shareholders, i do think this speaks volumes to them", "we could have stayed the course", "we had a pretty explicit contract in terms of a lawsuit", "not a single one of my \u2013 this had to be approved by my shareholders to do this transaction \u2013 not a single one of them voted against it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0just to clarify, you\u2019re saying by all of your shareholders or a majority or board of directors", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0no, no, all of my shareholders voted", "it had to be by a majority", "but not a single one voted against it", "not a single one", "that speaks volumes, i think, to who funded me, what they really cared about", "an easier path to money was probably just staying on the path that we were on", "this is the path of getting it right", "this is about it always having been about the women and really defining success the way we want to", "we had a great outcome for a company and now, we have the ability to just do it in a different way, in a way that we\u2019re all proud of", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i have plenty of questions, but what\u2019s next, then, for that particular drug", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0what\u2019s next is 101", "it\u2019s access, that women have access to the product", "it\u2019s education, that we remove some of the myth and misconception that surrounds female viagra and the condition itself, and then i think it is marching across the globe", "we\u2019ve got a lot of work in front of us", "tim ferriss:\u00a0are you going to be at the helm", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "so many questions\u2026 let\u2019s talk about rules for a second", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0okay", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i think you\u2019ve drawn this distinction", "there are a lot of rules out there", "there are some that you\u2019re generally better off following", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0the rules of law and order", "tim ferriss:\u00a0the rules of law and order, regulatory, and then there are unwritten rules or just socially reinforced rules", "so, what are some of the rules that you have broken or routinely break as a matter of personal best practices", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i embrace under-estimation as an opportunity to surprise people", "i think that i break rules in terms of it\u2019s frustrating to me when people say, \u201cyeah, but nobody does it that way.\u201d i\u2019m saying, \u201cokay, nobody does it that way, like show me a rule in which i cannot do it that way.\u201d if they don\u2019t have an answer to that, be they a lawyer, a consultant, whoever they may be, that\u2019s an unacceptable answer", "i think they just haven\u2019t dreamed up a new way to do something or a better way to do something", "i think that particularly women in business, i think women are bound by many more unwritten rules", "this tedx talk i gave was about this, like what\u2019s the dna of a female rulebreaker because i think that it takes this extraordinary injustice and the empathy that surrounds that for them to really break a rule", "that certainly is my story \u2013 fueled by the injustice, really informed by listening", "why would i move forward with something that nobody else was willing to do", "i think there are rules about, \u201cdo you talk about money?\u201d i like to say in the pinkubator, my goal is to make women really rich", "that elicits a certain response", "i do these pajama parties in the pinkubator, eighth grade girls \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0the pinkubator \u2013 we\u2019re going to come back to this, but could you give us a sense or two on what that is", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0sure", "as part of the pink ceiling, i make early bets on breakthrough first either buyer for women and they all become part of my pinkubator", "so, i\u2019ve got ten different companies in there right now, all with a female lens", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how are you going to balance that with\u2026", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0having a great team", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0having a great team", "it\u2019s certainly not all me", "i didn\u2019t get to here without having had the most incredible people surround me, many of them do today", "i\u2019m with people who know all of my stories because they\u2019ve been on the ride with me for 13+ years through the startups", "so, it\u2019s always about the other people you surround yourself with", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so far, we\u2019ve talked about not necessarily the highlight reel, but we\u2019ve talked about a bunch of huge successes", "i\u2019d love for you to talk about \u2013 this is from a bit of my homework also", "correct me if this is wrong and i\u2019d really love to dig in very briefly \u2013 for people listening, this isn\u2019t going to be all startup, finance for the next 30 minutes, so just sit tight", "this will apply more broadly", "but i read that one mistake that you made at one point in your business was taking money from someone you either didn\u2019t know very well or didn\u2019t trust", "can you talk about what you learned from that to the extent that you can disclose whatever you\u2019re comfortable disclosing and then how that informed later decisions or approaches", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0my biggest fail, really and truly", "early days of slate, i was fortunate that this drug was adopted by the top-tier", "they were out at medical conferences talking about it and all of a sudden, i\u2019m getting phone calls in from other people like, \u201chey, i write testosterone", "why has nobody come by to see me?\u201d i really didn\u2019t have the capital to build a sales organization on my own", "so, i went out with a company that would build a sales organization around it", "i did the deal, all the right intentions, seemingly", "it couldn\u2019t have departed more radically in terms of our philosophy on how you compensate people, on how you treat people", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and because you didn\u2019t have the money, you paid them in equity", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yes", "they had a seat on my board", "they came into this company, had this partnership with them", "it was that inexperience, i think, in my first company of going, \u201cgod, i need money", "god, i need this partner", "i need this for scale,\u201d and not being discriminating enough in terms of really who they were.\u201d so, it was painful because we really didn\u2019t get along", "it had the ability to cripple the company", "at that moment that i could cut the deal, i had swallowed hard, hired as many people as i could", "our eight people were out sell their 40, cut the deal and \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0cut meaning ended", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0ended it and went off to the races", "but it taught me the lesson of \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0how long did it take you to cut the deal", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0a year", "i had a year agreement with them", "it took years off my life", "it didn\u2019t feel like a year", "it felt like a longer than that", "but it was a lesson of who i was going to raise money from going forward", "this is the perfect segue to it", "i had to buy out their position", "i needed them the hell of my board", "they could have stayed on the board even with that deal gone", "i had people coming in to try to buy it out", "actually, one guy came in, a vc, and he came to our table", "one of the things i want to do is i spent time with him and he came out to the glass table, where we have our lunch together every day", "he was hideous to one of my sales reps, just like the attitude, how he treated them", "i thought, \u201cabsolutely not", "i am not doing it.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0\u201ci\u2019ve seen how this move turns out", "let\u2019s not do that.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0the next group came in", "it was a family office", "also came, sat with my table, wanted them to be there", "they said nothing", "i was like, \u201coh my god, we\u2019re not going to get the money", "we\u2019re going under.\u201d it was so important", "i needed to get this group out", "they called me back and they said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to invest for what we saw at the table.\u201d so, they were the right person", "i now started to understand i have to have people who care about who we are in our mission", "so, i raised, actually, almost all of my money through basically angels or family offices, very unconventional in pharma", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how much funding", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0$100 million", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright", "so, $100 million through angels \u2013 i\u2019m guessing we\u2019re not talking like $25,000.00 checks", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0correct", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how many of these people did you know in advance before raising the money", "it doesn\u2019t need to be an exact number", "what percentage of the people you raised money from did you know before hand", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0three", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay", "roughly how many were there", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0 we were at a little over 100 in the end", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how they hell do you do that without it becoming your full-time job for six-plus months", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0it grew through word of mouth", "i was fortunate that they introduced me to a group or they introduced me to a group", "so, i had pockets of investors that i treated almost like they were units", "i have an incredible group of investors in fort worth, texas", "i love to go visit them", "but it was so flattering, i think, that they helped me get there", "i came from no background where i had access to this kind of privilege", "i didn\u2019t know these high-net worth individuals", "but i was fortunate that once one of them came in, they introduced me to others", "there actually was great joy in communicating with them", "i didn\u2019t see it as a full-time job", "i actually saw it as an opportunity for this incredible network, who today come in on a lot of my companies as well and invest in them", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you choose people", "how did you vet them", "i know companies with \u2013 let\u2019s just say in contrast", "you could certainly have, say, a vc, venture capitalist, or somebody who comes in, writes a huge check and they say, \u201cnumber one, i need 10, 20 percent of the company and i want at least one seat on the board.\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0sure", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that has its potential pitfalls", "i\u2019ve also seen situations where startups that are super lean and have a small company have a ton of people on their cap table", "they\u2019ve taken a ton of investors", "all of a sudden, they\u2019re getting the hug of death, basically, because even if the investors are trying to be helpful, they\u2019re managing communications with 100 people", "so, how did you think about avoiding that", "family offices are kind of a unique animal, but how did you think about avoiding that potential problem", "\u00a0 cindy whitehead:\u00a0i actually think i was hyper-communicative myself", "i went on the offense on that", "they were part of this with me", "they were part of the ride", "i was going to turn around to them and say, \u201chow are you going to help me", "who are you going to introduce me to", "what am i not thinking of here?\u201d these are very impressive people", "so, i think i didn\u2019t wait for that to choke me", "if anything, they would tell you like i communicated a lot", "i expected a lot of them", "i felt like they were part of it", "they were owners in this and they had to perform not unlike the owners of my employees", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i promised we\u2019d come back to the pinkubator", "so, what is the pink ceiling", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, the pink ceiling is investment firm meets hell of a great place for mentorship, where we make bets on early stage companies by or for women", "mostly all health tech and not only, i think, disruptive first, but often products that can be catalysts in social conversations we care about", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what would be some examples of products or companies", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0so, a company with a technology that detects date rape drugs in drinks", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how does it detect", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0through color change", "so, dip your finger in a drink, touch your finger to the decal", "it changes colors if there\u2019s a date rape drug", "i have two nieces in college", "it\u2019s sad that we need a product like this, but we need to put power in the hands of women \u2013 great company", "it\u2019s sort of the quintessential fit for who we were", "love the tech \u2013 first of its kind, patented, but also just love the social conversation it promotes", "flushable pregnancy test coming out, great female founder \u2013 i think only a woman would have thought of that", "it\u2019s not your mother\u2019s pregnancy test, right", "in so many ways, not only in the eco way, but i think also because we have this belief that all women want a certain outcome when they take a pregnancy test", "some women want to get rid of the evidence, including women who are going through infertility and don\u2019t want a daily reminder", "that\u2019s a product", "i have a great young female founder who has a biometric sensor to recognize deviations in movement for athletes so they can start to signal when you\u2019re moving differently and may injure in the future", "she\u2019s such a story \u2013 mother was a russian mail order bride, wanted to move herself and her daughter to a better life, came over to the us in a pretty poor neighborhood", "she thought, \u201cmy only way out is if i get a scholarship in athletics,\u201d became a nationally ranked soccer player, injured", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, soccer is brutal.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cindy whitehead:\u00a0she decided, \u201cokay, i still have upper body strength, became a rower, got a full ride to duke, and then invented this tech", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oh my god, what a beast", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0love her", "when ivana walked in the room, i will tell you \u2013 when she walked in the room, i was buying no matter what she was selling", "tim ferriss:\u00a0she didn\u2019t have to yell, \u201cballs,\u201d for you", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0no, she did not", "i didn\u2019t tell her this at the moment, but i was investing because even if this wasn\u2019t her deal, the next one was going to be", "so, it\u2019s fun because i get to bet on these great people, doing, i think, really interesting things", "tim ferriss:\u00a0where is it based", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0we\u2019re in raleigh, north carolina, where i\u2019ve built all my companies", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what should people know about raleigh", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0people should know that raleigh is number two in the country in terms of exits", "i think that surprises people", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i didn\u2019t know that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0there you go", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you would expect me to know that and i didn\u2019t", "shame on me", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0pitchbook did the terms of the multiples we get out of companies", "so, the next billion-dollar company will come from raleigh, just like who knew the birthplace of female viagra was raleigh, north carolina", "great startup scene, wonderful talent in that area", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m going to read a quote and it may be off, but i liked it", "so, i thought maybe i could ask you to elaborate on it", "i\u2019m not sure where i found this, but i think it\u2019s yours", "\u201cwe talk all the time about how women need a voice", "we don\u2019t need a voice", "we need power", "money is power.\u201d please explain or please, tell me where that comes from", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i think we just \u2013 we\u2019re constantly in the discussion around women talking about needing a voice", "what really changes is when women have power", "the power that comes with money is to sit on the other side of the table and make the decisions \u2013 2 percent of vc funding goes to women, 2 percent", "that means we think have the population have 2 percent of the good ideas", "it\u2019s ridiculous", "if you consider it, what we need to do is get women to outcomes like mine so they get to sit on the table, sit at the other side of the table and pick those things they really care about", "not pass over a product for women thinking it\u2019s a niche brand", "i think it\u2019s also just this comfort with the conversation around money", "i started talking about these pajamas parties in the pinkubator", "we have eighth-grade girls come through", "we do all these drills or setting their sites for the c-suite", "the first group we ever had come in, one of their teachers came and she said, \u201coh, cindy, when they were coming over here, they wanted to ask you about money but we told them you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d i said, \u201coh, no, no, have them ask me.\u201d the young girl who was asking me all the questions and getting to the real data, that girl is going to create a big company", "that\u2019s okay to have that conversation", "even as a woman, those are some of the unwritten rules", "when i first got an opportunity to go out and speak on these stages to rising star female entrepreneurs or women in business, a woman came up to me and said, \u201ci love that you don\u2019t ever say that you sold your company for over $1 billion.\u201d the next time i got up on stage, i said, \u201chi, i\u2019m cindy whitehead", "i sold my last company for $1 billion,\u201d because i was clear that, \u201coh my god, i\u2019m doing it.\u201d here\u2019s why i say it happily \u2013 because women will pay it back", "they\u2019ll give it back to other women", "they\u2019ll give it back into their community", "there\u2019s plenty of data sources on that", "what i love to see and my greatest pride has been the ripple effect of ownership", "everyone who came to work for me got skin in the game", "to watch our outcomes and what it has meant for them in terms of freedom \u2013 i don\u2019t really mean financial freedom", "if you\u2019re in it just for the money, you\u2019re never going to be successful", "but it affords them not only financial freedom, but freedom to do the things they really care about", "i\u2019m watching them start their own companies or fund their children\u2019s companies", "that\u2019s what i love to see as an army pink ladies coming out of the pinkubator who are sponsoring the next group to do it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i love that you also caught yourself or even if you didn\u2019t have that as a subconscious behavior, made it a point to get up and say what you might have not been saying", "i think this underscores something really critical, which is we \u2013 and this is not gender-specific, anyone \u2013 we often think of the external opponents and how we might be restricted by someone else, which could very well be the case and is the case very often", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0however, when you\u2019re looking for unwritten rules, it\u2019s important not to just look at unwritten rules that are being imposed on you externally, but to look at the unwritten rules you were following", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0absolutely", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i remember talking to \u2013 i\u2019m not going to name her because i don\u2019t have her permission \u2013 but super successful female entrepreneur and i asked her what some of the main challenges were she thought women were facing", "she mentioned quite a few, which you\u2019re very familiar with", "but one that i didn\u2019t expect was she said women need to learn how to ask for raises and negotiate", "a lot of them just don\u2019t ask", "i don\u2019t know exactly why that is, but i was like, \u201coh, fuck.\u201d when i think about the female founders i\u2019ve invested in, whether it\u2019s leah at taskrabbit, which was acquired not too long ago by ikea, or tracy dinunzio or any number of these women, they are all so good at negotiating", "it didn\u2019t even cross my mind that i was like, \u201coh, shit.\u201d it\u2019s certainly true for a lot of men as well", "the point being be really cognizant of \u2013 this definitely goes for everybody, not just women, but where you are following rules that are really just enforced in your own mind", "you can certainly experiment with bending and breaking.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 cindy whitehead:\u00a0 i think a lack of asking for raises is also that discomfort or that don\u2019t brag", "it\u2019s sort of not lady-like to talk about money or be capitalistic, if you will", "i think that has an incredible effect that maybe we\u2019re not so conscious of", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, totally", "if you were going to teach, say, a freshman class \u2013 i\u2019ll come back to the freshman class again \u2013 or a class, if you were going to teach a seminar \u2013 it could be any age range", "you could pick your audience", "it could be female-only", "it could be mixed gender", "it doesn\u2019t matter", "what would you teach", "what would the seminar look like", "it\u2019s like once a week, two or three hours a week", "you have as many weeks as you want", "what would you teach", "it doesn\u2019t have to be anything we talked about", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0what would i teach", "i would push people around how you\u2019re going to make choices in life", "i think that my teaching would be how do you set out there and sort of remove all of those confinements in thinking", "i am lucky, i think, having grown up in such a mobile childhood", "i think what it taught me is you can imagine i was always \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0mobile, physically mobile", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0physically mobile", "tim ferriss:\u00a0was your dad state department", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0state department, yeah", "i was the perpetual new kid and always having to have that agony of what was going to happen", "it turned out nothing bad happened, right", "in retrospect, i went in anticipating that", "i think that really helped me", "i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a course", "is that a course", "can i teach a course in losing the fear", "what\u2019s the worst that can happen and helping folks go through that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "you can just have case study after case study after case study", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i think when i do the pinkubator, i\u2019m teaching a course in, really at its core, confidence for these girls", "it\u2019s confidence in the choices that they make and going all in when they\u2019re going to do it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019d love to actually hear you elaborate on that", "i\u2019m looking through my many, many, many notes", "one of the things i highlighted where i was like, \u201cyes, please, thank you for that,\u201d this is for fortune", "the question was, \u201cwhat advice would you give early stage founders?\u201d and it was, \u201cembrace the workhorse to become the unicorn", "i\u2019m so tired of all the grandiose startup speak, the founders who declare their genius before they ever even execute it", "so, what i tell founders is don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to change the world", "put your head down, do the work and show me.\u201d so, assuming that\u2019s somewhat accurate, i\u2019m asked all the time, \u201chow do i build my confidence?\u201d or, \u201chow can i become confident?\u201d the best answer i\u2019ve been able to come up with \u2013 and this is just my perspective \u2013 is you have to actually believe in yourself", "the way you develop that belief is by actually getting onto the playing field and taking your lumps, but proving to yourself that you have certain competencies", "it\u2019s not about like stuart smalley sitting in front of a mirror telling yourself how awesome you are and believing that and then going out and getting your face ripped off by the real world", "no, you actually have to put in the time to earn the confidence that you then carry", "what has your experience been or how do you think of that with the startup founders", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "well, look, i\u2019m particularly focused on women and i think that just by virtue of the numbers, they tend to be unexpected in the room", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do you mean by that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0they\u2019re unexpected", "by the numbers, we\u2019re not expecting them to walk through the room and ask for the money", "they\u2019re not likely to get the funding, all of that", "i think that\u2019s certainly been the course of my career", "when you say pharmaceutical ceo who sold the last business for $1 billion, nobody imagines me showing up in hot pink", "i don\u2019t look the part", "i\u2019m not your classic in any way and i think that\u2019s been sort of the story of my career in terms of places i\u2019ve gone or products i\u2019ve taken on have been unexpected", "so, as a result of being unexpected, i think it\u2019s underestimated", "so, my key piece of advice is underestimation, you have two choices \u2013 you can either reel back in frustration and self-doubt, you can let that eat away at you, or you can gamify it as this opportunity to surprise people with your competence", "so, i think that for founders, i\u2019m looking at how they reframe the frustrations, the setbacks, the kicks in the teeth to this opportunity to go forward and surprise", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do you say to women \u2013 i don\u2019t know if you get this question \u2013 cindy whitehead:\u00a0that\u2019s confidence", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "what do you say to women \u2013 i don\u2019t get this question because i\u2019m not a woman, but i\u2019ve certainly, with some of my founders, they get this question a lot from other founders, which is the belief \u2013 it might not even be a question that women should dial back their womenness, femininity \u2013 cindy whitehead:\u00a0did you hear my reaction", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i did hear that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0i choked", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i did hear the choke", "this seems to be a very common belief, not just among women, but certainly advice that men would give to women", "it\u2019s very prevalent", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0the worst", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do you think of that", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0the worst advice", "it\u2019s given and it\u2019s given woman to woman, for sure", "whatever it may be, i absolutely \u2013 part of the reason i wear pink \u2013 so, i wear pink all the time", "you should see my closet", "but when i went through the process with the \u201cfemale viagra,\u201d it was called the little pink pill", "people all but patted me on the shoulder and said, \u201cthat\u2019s cute.\u201d the little pink pill was so dismissive that i realized, \u201cmy god, this is a conversation we need to be having.\u201d i started showing up in blazing pink to the fda", "\u201chi, we\u2019re going to talk about this.\u201d i think what it taught me is like in gender stereotypes or that underestimation, you run away from it", "i guess, if you\u2019re me, you run right toward it", "the idea that there isn\u2019t something valuable and unique that a woman brings to the table and in owning her femininity \u2013 you know, pink for me is about owning it as a woman, unapologetically pink", "i like pink", "i\u2019m going to wear it", "we\u2019re going to have this conversation", "so, i think that\u2019s the way to go", "i tell women all the time, \u201cif you are in an environment in which you need to not wear makeup, pull your hair back, not be you\u2026\u201d listen, i was at a table \u2013 i won\u2019t name the\u00a0 conference \u2013 where were giving advice to younger women across the table", "a woman very

influential in my life", "tim ferriss:\u00a0can you think of an example of them kicking you in the ass or what they would say to you to be like, \u201creally?\u201d cindy whitehead:\u00a0yeah", "i think it\u2019s just generally\u2026 tim ferriss:\u00a0what do they do professionally, if you don\u2019t mind me asking", "cindy whitehead:\u00a0sure", "so, one is a lawyer, who actually, has an operating role in a big construction company, and the other one was a startup guy, who\u2019s head of sales and marketing for a company", "he was a big part of why i went smaller when i left my big
