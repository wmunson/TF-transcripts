"raw_text": "tim ferriss:  amelia boone has been called the michael jordan of obstacle course racing. since the sports inception she's amassed - she's laughing - more than 30 victories, and 50 podiums. her major victories include; the spartan race world championship 2003, spartan race series point champion 2013 and 2015, and she's the only three time winner of the world's toughest mudder 2012, '14, and '15. she's also three time finisher of the death race, and dabbles in ultra-running in all of her spare time, which i'm sure is massive, and has a flourishing and high velocity career to bootamelia, welcome to the show.  amelia boone: thank you. thanks for having me.  tim ferriss: yeah, i appreciate you taking the time, and i thought we could start with a photo. so, i was doing research for this, and went to your website, which is ameliabooneracing.com?  amelia boone: yes. mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: and, can you describe the photo that takes up most of the real estate on that page?  amelia boone: well - so, the website needs a bit of updating. i'm not a great website person. so, if you know - if anybody wants to volunteer, be my guest. but, it's a picture of me, i'm in the middle of barbed wire, and i'm crawling on my hands and knees. and, i'm just, kind of, looking around, semi-perplexed. and, to me that just, kind of, encapsulates everything that i do; i'm bleeding from my knees, my elbows, and it's - i'm just crawling through the mud, having a good time.  tim ferriss: this is a microcosm of the face of obstacle course racing.  amelia boone: exactly. exactly, it's not pretty.  tim ferriss: and, we met through scott keneally.  amelia boone: mm-hmm.    tim ferriss: who is putting together, it may be finished by the time people see this is available, rise of the sufferfests. so, sufferfest, you mentioned the dirt,t he barbed wire. maybe we can explain, to people who are unfamiliar, what obstacle course racing is, with the example of the world's toughest mudder.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: can you describe, what on earth that is?  amelia boone: well - so, that's kind of like the extreme of obstacle course racing.  tim ferriss: right.  amelia boone: but, in general, i think people have been familiar with spartan races, with tough mudders. you see people jumping over fire and crawling under barbed wire, and it's just - you're running along and you have a wall to climb. and, your jumping through mud, and you're using everything that you have. it's just a completely physical experience   so, i got involved back in 2011 when i ran a tough mudder with friends, and then signed up for - there was this race that was announced called world's toughest mudder, and they were like, \"you, for 24 hours, are gonna run as many laps of a course, a tough mudder course, as you can. and, it's gonna be in december, in new jersey.\" and, so -   tim ferriss: sounds balmy.  amelia boone:  - balmy.  i was like, \"man, i can't think of anywhere i'd rather go than new jersey in december.\" and so, a bunch of us signed - i think 1,000 people signed up for this, and nobody had any idea what they were getting into. we had all run a tough mudder, or run a spartan race, but nobody had ever really done it for 24 hours. so, we went out on that day, and people were trying to figure out, \"how do you stay worm for 24 hours, when you're in and out of water, and it's december, and it's new jersey?\"    so, we decided that we would wear wet suits, or that wet suits would be the way to stay warm. and, other people, former triathletes, \"oh, there's no way you can run for 24 hours in a wet suit, you'll die.\" your thermal regulation will be all off, or whatever.   but, we did. and, halfway through - so, we all go out, and it's like   30 degrees outside in new jersey.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: after the first lap, there were about 1,000 people that had started, i'd say maybe 850 people dropped out.  tim ferriss: after the first lap?  amelia boone: just done. first lap, done.  tim ferriss: and, this was, what, like an hour - a few hours into it?  amelia boone: probably an hour and a half. and, i remember going back in my tent, and just shivering uncontrollably. i was being like, \"what am i doing? what is going on here?\"  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: you would walk past the med tents, and there were just people in there, laying on cots. they were using warm saline bags to put under people's armpits to keep them warm. so, a few of us decided that we were going to keep going and, i think by the time the night descended on us, it was 2 a.m. we were wading through water, and there was ice forming. we were breaking holes in the ice, and i'm sitting there like, \"what am i doing? what am i doing?\" but, at the same time, having so much fun. and, out of 1,000 people that started that race, 12 finished, and i was one of two women.   so, that was the start of it all. for some unknown reason, i remember when i finished that race 24 hours later, i was like, \"never again, never again.\" then, two weeks later, i was like, \"sign me up. what's next? sign me up.\"  tim ferriss: the drive to do this type of thing - there's so many different approaches i could take to try to dissect this, but are your parents very surprised, not surprised at all, or somewhere in between?  amelia boone: i would say, somewhere in between because i've always been the high achiever. i'm type a; i want to be at the top of my class, i want to be graduating summa cum laude and going to law school, and everything like that.  tim ferriss: i read that one of your law school classmates said that you would find a way to be competitive, or to win, in anything, if it were folding laundry of otherwise.    amelia boone: oh, yeah. in law school, the extent of my exercise was getting on the elliptical, like everybody else, and i would find a way to compete with the person on the elliptical next to me. man, those were the days   so, i think the drive and determination, that doesn't phase my parents. they're like, \"par for the course.\" but, in terms of how it manifested itself - because i've always been a creature of routine, and i don't like surprises, and i want to be able to plan everything and know everything. with obstacle course racing it's so unknown when you go out there. for the most part, when i first started, they wouldn't even show you - you wouldn't see a course map, so you wouldn't know what was out there.   so, i think at that part, they're kind of like, \"wow.\" or, when i would sign up for the death race, and they would be like, \"72 hours in the woods, and you don't know what you're going to be doing, but have at it.\" so, that was a very atypical personality for me.  tim ferriss: where did you grow up?  amelia boone: i grew up in portland, oregon.  tim ferriss: in portland. and, what did your parents do growing up?  amelia boone: so, my dad was an insurance adjuster, and my mom was an environmental consultant.  tim ferriss: where did the competitive edge come from?  amelia boone: it's funny, they have no idea, and i have - i think it's got to be innate, to be totally honest, because my parents were always like, \"you can get c's, that's fine,\" or, \"you can play this sport, or you don't have to play this sport. as long as your happy. just do what makes you happy.\"   tim ferriss: sounds more portland.  amelia boone: yeah, right? it was never, if you think of sage parents, i was the opposite of that. so, they were always telling me to calm down and take a break, but instead i just -   tim ferriss: that worked well.    amelia boone: yeah, right?  tim ferriss: do you have siblings?  amelia boone: i do. i have an older sister.  tim ferriss: older sister.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: is she also competitively driven, like yourself?  amelia boone: no, we're pretty much, in terms of personalities, opposites.  tim ferriss: polar opposites?  amelia boone: polar opposites. she's extremely successful, but she came about it from a very - way more laid back and low key approach.  tim ferriss: what did you want to be when you were a kid? what did you want to be when you grew up?  amelia boone: i wanted to be a lawyer when i grew up.  tim ferriss: oh, and you nailed it.  amelia boone: i nailed it. i was one of those people that was like, \"if i set my mind to something, then i'm going to do it.\" so, i would - for lunch everyday, when i was home for the summer, my mom and i would watch perry mason, and i was like, \"man, perry mason, being an attorney, he gets the bad guy to confess every single episode. that's got to be cool.\"  tim ferriss: perry mason is great. i remember perry mason.  amelia boone: so, then i went to law school, and realized that's not actually what happens, and - yeah.  tim ferriss: so, you were a perry mason than a matlock person?  amelia boone: yes, yes. i was a perry mason person.  tim ferriss: so, you decide you want to be a lawyer. did that change, did that waiver, or did that stick with you all the way up until the point that you became a lawyer?    amelia boone: i think it pretty much - i kind of thought of different things in college. i really got - i really fell in love with anthropology and primates. so, i really love studying monkeys. and, i thought for a part of me, maybe i should go to madagascar and hang out with the lemurs, or i could go get a law degree. so, i double majored in anthropology and political science, and then decided to take the safe route and go with the law degree.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm. and, that was u washington, or - ?  amelia boone: washington university in st. louis.  tim ferriss: washington university.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: that's right. what did you do athletically in high school, or college?  amelia boone: so, growing up i was kind of like a jack-of-all-trades athlete in that i played - i was always on a club team like asa softball, or club soccer, traveling basketball, so i played year round   and, i was always good. i was on the competitive, the highest level teams. i was never a super stand-out all-star in any one single sport. so, i played year-round, and i would shuttle back and forth from practice to practice throughout middle school, and then high school. but, i started paring that down, and i actually - as high school progressed, i got more and more into musical theatre, and show choir, and singing, and i kind of gave up sports and athleticsso, in college, actually, i sang in an a capella group, but i had no sports.  tim ferriss: no sports in college.  amelia boone: no sports.  tim ferriss: recreationally, were you a runner?  amelia boone: i would go out in run to stay in shape, but running in st. louis kind of sucked. so, it was either hot and muggy, or freezing cold. so, yeah. i didn't really do anything.  tim ferriss: let's sort of - i'm gonna jump around a little bit, like memento.  amelia boone: yeah.    tim ferriss: but, if we were to look at, say, the world's toughest mudder.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: what do your routines look like? you said you're a creature of habit, as am i. the hours before the competition, let's just say the day of, what are your routines?  amelia boone: so, i always get up super early before - well, i get up super early in general every morning, and i -   tim ferriss: what's super early?  amelia boone: so, my alarm typically goes off right around 4 a.m.  tim ferriss: that's why you didn't flinch when we were talking about jocko willink, the seal commander.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: i'm like, \"and, he wakes up at 4 a.m.\"  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: zero response. i'm like, \"uh-oh, another one. here we are.\"  amelia boone: yeah, 4 a.m., and - so actually, on race days, it's almost like i sleep in a little bit, but -   tim ferriss: when do the races start typically?  amelia boone: they generally will start - world's toughest mudder is a little bit different, that one starts at 2 p.m. now, but just a regular obstacle course race would generally be 7:30 a.m. is the starting time.  tim ferriss: i got it. so, that starts at 2 p.m. so, let's use that example. you wake up at 4 a.m-   amelia boone: oh, yeah. then, i drive myself crazy for the next however many hours, twiddling my thumbs.  tim ferriss: what other type of body prep, or mental prep, do you do?  amelia boone: yeah. i generally use the distraction technique.    tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: so, i try to not think about it, really. because i can sit there and make myself miserable over and over, picturing the race, or whatever. but, i find it helpful, actually - i actually do a lot of work in the mornings before races. so, i'll catch up on emails, i'll do things from my attorney life. and then, in terms of body prep, i do a lot of foam rolling, mobility, things like that. the older i get, the more i realize that i can't just jump out of bed in the morning, and be spry as a chicken.  tim ferriss: you're 32, is that right? 32?  amelia boone: 32, yeah.  tim ferriss: 32. i would imagine yous till have a couple of good years left in you, but -   amelia boone: yes. sometimes it feels a lot worse though, let me tell you.  tim ferriss: the mobility work that you do, what does that actually look like in detail?  amelia boone: yeah. so, i generally carry an arsenal of every single - from a golf ball, a lacrosse ball, a softball, a foam roller. so, i'm really focused on loosening up hips, loosening up hamstrings, and every single different, little torture device has - the golf ball is for the foot  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: the lacrosse ball works well on the gluts. the softball is great for the hamstrings. so, i'm just getting the muscles warmed up, and loosened, and prepped. i do - i actually, from a lot of various nagging injuries that i've always had, i have little physical therapy routines that i always do too. you know, like to get your gluts activated, and things like that.  tim ferriss: what type of movements do you do for glut activation?  amelia boone: there's this fantastic exercise, called jane fonda's -   tim ferriss: jane fonda's.  amelia boone: - that, if anybody's ever been in -   tim ferriss: are these for, like, glut median, or are these - ?    amelia boone: oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. glut median,where you're sitting there, and you're like, \"man, i should really have leg warmers on right now.\"  tim ferriss: so, you're talking about - is this the bent leg - sort of the reverse thigh master?  amelia boone: pretty much, yeah.  tim ferriss: yeah?  amelia boone: it's the reverse thigh master.  tim ferriss: on your side?  amelia boone: yeah, yeah, yeah. and, variations, like doing fire hydrants, that too; a dog lifting it's legs. these are all super sexy things that people - if you do them in a gym, people are like, \"oh, godthere's that girl.\"  tim ferriss: well, i'll tell you: i think you get more attention doing fire hydrants than i do at least, unless i'm in a gym in the castro.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: which, it might be a similar experience. and, do  you use any other modalities for rep? do you use any stem, do you use anything like that pre-race, or is that set aside for other purposes?  amelia boone: pre-race, not so much. no, that's more like recovery. recovery i'll -  compression boots, and stem.  tim ferriss: now, are compression boots the compression socks, or are these actual boots?  amelia boone: the boots that inflate, you know?  tim ferriss: ah, right.  amelia boone: the air pressure chambers that supposedly flush out lactic acid.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm. and, that's post-race?  amelia boone: that would be post-race, yeah.  tim ferriss: so - well, let's talk about post-race then. so, in terms of facilitating   recovery; so, you finish the race.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: and, is it true that you have not slept for days on end after races, or is that an exaggeration?  amelia boone: no, it is true. so, any long race that i've done - like world's toughest mudder is a 24 hour race. i've done other races that are longer - 48 - that are 60 hours. and, i feel like it's - i can't sleep afterwards. and, you feel like you should be able to. you're like, \"wow. i was just up for three days straight, running around in the woods.\" but, my mind -  your body is so physically exhausted, but my mind is still on overdrive, so i just can't.   so for instance, this year, after world's toughest mudder, there was a group of us staying at a house; sat around, were drinking beers, watching a football game. and, i was like, \"man, i should really be getting drunk right now.\" or, something like that because i've been drinking, i've been running around in a wet suit all night long. i'm like, \"i don't feel anything.\" i don't feel any effects of the booze, or anything like that. i was like, \"it just must be this adrenaline still pumping through me.\"  tim ferriss: mm-hmm. did other people have the same, or similar experience, or is that unique to you?  amelia boone: i think, no because everyone else just, kind of, passed out and went to bed.  tim ferriss: okay.  amelia boone: so, i was like, \"hey, guys! let's - hey, okay. everyone's asleep right now, cool.\"  tim ferriss: and, when you cross the finish line, as such, you're done. what type of recovery starts? what are the actions that you take in the hours following the race?  amelia boone: so, i think one of the most important things that people should do, that they don't, is you have to stay moving. people wanna finish a race, and especially a long one, and just lay on a couch, or go to sleep. that is the worst thing you can do because you're gonna wake up and not be able to move anything. so, i generally try to stay walking, i try to stay active. i will hop, again, on a foam roller, or something like that, and try - you don't wanna be too aggressive   afterwards. you're not gonna hop on a softball and roll out your gluts because that's gonna hurt really bad.   but then, just try to stay active. and, that is in the next day too; gentle movement, and things like that.  tim ferriss: do you use - are you a proponent of ice, ice baths, or anything like that? or, are you not?  amelia boone: if i can't - so look, i'm not a scientist. all i know is what works for me. people have different opinions. if i can get into an ice bath, i will, but it needs to be immediately. so, there have been races where there's been a lake right next to me, and i'm like,  \"if it's cold enough, then i'll just go jump in the lake.\" and, kind of use that as an ice bath. but, if you're waiting four or five hours, i don't think it's gonna end up helping you in the end.  tim ferriss: and, i want you to correct me if i'm wrong; 2012 world's toughest mudder.  amelia boone: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: how did you place?  amelia boone: i won for females, but i was second overall in 2012.  tim ferriss: second place overall.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: how did that feel?  amelia boone: so, it was a really interesting race.  tim ferriss: how many competitors?  amelia boone: this was -  again,t here were about 1,200 people, i believe. that's generally every year. so, there were about 1,200 people. this one - they move it to november, so it was supposedly a tiny bit warmer, but actually it wasn't. it was actually colder in 2012 than it was in 2011. and, i guess he didn't realize - i knew i was winning for women, and at this point we were about 24 hours - or, getting close to the end, and i was about 80 sole odd miles in. and, i was on the last lap. they were like, \"okay, well you've won for women, but the guy that's winning is nine minutes ahead of you.\"     so, we're on this last lap, going - we'll end up with 90 miles. and, there are all these people from tough mudder headquarters, and all these people that matter, just yelling at me, willing me to go on because all they want me to do is to win overall, you know? and, you're so tired at that point, and so, kind of, delirious that, i guess, i didn't even realize the import of that situation; how massive that would've been. because i was just like, \"leave me alone. i hurt, i'm tired, i'm freezing.\"  tim ferriss: \"i hear you.\"  amelia boone: i'm covered in ten millimeters of neoprene, i've just - and, i'm like, \"i get it. i'm trying to move fast, but my body won't let me.\" but, yeah. so, i ended up finishing about nine minutes behind the male, overall winner. yeah. so, it was pretty - it didn't really hit me until a day or two later, where i was like, \"oh, i was that closeokay.\"  tim ferriss: so, did you not - did you feel pride about finishing second overall? or, were you just - were you more disappointed that you didn't finish first overall?  amelia boone: no, no, no. i completely felt pride, and it's actually - it's one of these things now that, when i race, it's almost - i kind of look at the standing - it's cool to win, as a female, to be like, \"oh, i'm the female winner.\" but, i more look of like - i have a consistent goal of trying to place top ten overall, you know?  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: i wanna be - i don't care about sex or gender. i just wanna be - i wanna compete the best overall, so.  tim ferriss: and, the next female finisher, what place was she?  amelia boone: actually, in 2012, she was third.  tim ferriss: oh, no kidding?  amelia boone: yeah. so, the top -   tim ferriss: wow, good for her. what was her name?  amelia boone: deanna blegg. she's amazing. she's absolutely amazing. 46 years old, from australia.    tim ferriss: 46?  amelia boone: yeah. just crushes it out there.  tim ferriss: what a beast.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: okay, all my excuses just went out the window.  amelia boone: i know, right? right? and, she's the like the nicest woman in the entire world, too  tim ferriss: how does her strategy, for training or in the race itself, differ from a younger competitor?  amelia boone: i would say - i think probably, as you get older, you realize you don't go out as fast. it's kind of like, as you age, you're never gonna out-sprint a 20-something-year-old. but, you tend to have more mental strength, more mental grit, the older you get, just because you're like, \"whatever, this isn't a big deal.\" you're more mature, and you can deal with pain and suffering. so, i think that it's just more of a slow and steady; just keep going, one foot in front of the other.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: but, to that extent, that's how i operate too. i'm notoriously slow out of the gate. in the beginning of races i'm always struggling to catch up with everyone, which is why i like longer races. so, it's just picking them off one by one.  tim ferriss: when you are - actually, before that. so, suffering.  amelia boone: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: let's talk about suffering.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: i was just reading a letter of seneca's.  amelia boone: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: who is that guy.    amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: that's the bust on the kitchen counter over there. related to - i think it's, \"on fasting and celebration,\" something related to thatbut, it talks about exposing yourself to suffering.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: along the lines of, the more you sweat during peace, the less you bleed during war.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: and so, i practice fasting for many reasons; among those, being - practicing hardship, right?  amelia boone: okay.  tim ferriss: so, i can endure it in other areas of my life. do you dot hat in other places in your life? where you deliberately expose yourself to different types of pain or suffering as a practice? or, is it limited to the sufferfests?  amelia boone: with the amount that i race there's plenty of suffering involved in that.  tim ferriss: it's sufficient.  amelia boone: i guess, i can't do the fasting thing. i'm not good with that.  tim ferriss: well, you're burning a lot more calories than i am.  amelia boone: if i don't eat every few hours, it's trouble for anyone around mebut, i always try to train in less than ideal conditions, if i can, because i think that adds a lot to - it's super easy to go out for a run when it's 70 degrees.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and sunny. but, when i was living in chicago, which i did for the past six years, if there was a wind storm, or a thunderstorm, i was like, \"let me out.\"  tim ferriss: perfect time to run.  amelia boone: perfect time to go run. there was one time that i - they had shut   down lakefront path because the waves were coming over, and i was like, \"fuck it, i'm gonna run it anyway.\" and, apparently police don't like that. so, as i'm like -   tim ferriss: i'd love to see that. please tell me the police tried to catch you on foot. did they?  amelia boone: no. well, it was a bicycle cop.  tim ferriss: oh, alright.  amelia boone: who - i was actually surprised that he was out in the weather as well. but, yeah. and he was  like, \"you can't. this is shut down\" i'm like, \"i'm just training. no big deal. no big deal.\"  tim ferriss: yeah. did that sway his position?  amelia boone: no, no. no, not at all.  tim ferriss: so, training in less than ideal conditions.  amelia boone: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: when you look back at the races that you've run, the obstacle course races -   amelia boone: mm-hmm.  tim ferriss: what has been the most challenging obstacle for you, and what has been the most dangerous?  amelia boone: i would say, in terms of challenging, i always - so, there's always - i'm notoriously awful at throwing a spear. and, it's well known in communities that i can't throw a spear to save my life. and so, in spartan races there's always a spear throw, and it's actually cost me tons of different races. and, it's funny because it's one of those things that, if you practice you would probably be pretty good at it.  tim ferriss: this is why i'm puzzled right now. okay, keep going.  amelia boone: why? about throwing a spear?  tim ferriss: no, like summa cum laude, ace lawyer, world champion racer - okay. so, continue, not to interrupt.  amelia boone: well, i can't throw a spear, no.    tim ferriss: no, but it seems like the kind of thing you would sit down, and study, and master.  amelia boone: you would think so. i actually think that playing softball my entire life kind of screwed me because i would try to throw it like you throw a softball. which you can't do.  tim ferriss: oh, yeah. the underhand spear?  amelia boone: no, no, no, just -   tim ferriss: i'm just messing with you.  amelia boone: wah, wah, wah. she throws like a girl.  tim ferriss: no, no, no. but, come on, the pitching does - it's completely different, right?  amelia boone: yeah. yes, it is completely different.  tim ferriss: i'm referring to the pitching, folks. don't get all riled up.  amelia boone: right. so,t hat's always been - it's always been a challenge for meand, i finally figured it out, but it's one of those things that - it's such a silly thing to struggle with, i think. but, i guess that also could be the most dangerous because if you miss a spear throw, and somebody's around -   tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: no, i'm joking. but, there are some. in terms of danger for obstacles, there are times where i'm sitting there, being like, \"why hasn't somebody died in these?\" oh, i take that back. that's really bad because somebody did die. but -   tim ferriss: yeah. dangerous spark.  amelia boone: yeah. when you're racing for 24 hours, especially for really long, and you're climbing super tall things in the middle of the night, i'm always sitting there, being like, \"man, one misstep, and i'm falling backwards.\"  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: and, i've taken some big diggers off of walls, just because you're   so tired, you just end up falling off.  tim ferriss: big diggers meaning falls?  amelia boone: big, awful falls, you know.  tim ferriss: so, how - then these are walls that you're climbing over, similar to a military obstacle course?  amelia boone: yeah, yeah, yeah.  tim ferriss: how tall are they?  amelia boone: they vary, some are 8 feet, some are 10 feet, some are 12 feetsome have ropes to help you up them, others there's big laddersdo you know military tack ladders?  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: that climbing out of water. so, there was one time, i think it was in 2012 world's toughest mudder, you climbed one of those out of a lake, and it was 20 feet up. but, it was in the middle of the night, and it was frozen. and so, it's like iced over, and you're like, \"i'm gonna die, i'm gonna die.\" but, yeah. so, there's all these little dangers. and, people talk about the electricity involved in tough mudders.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: which is a very disconcerting - because i've been hit so hard sometimes that i've blacked out.  tim ferriss: from the electricity?  amelia boone: yeah, and just -   tim ferriss: can you describe this obstacle to folks?  amelia boone: yeah, so. well, there's a couple variations of it, but basically there's these wires hanging. the worst variation was called electric eeland, you crawl through water that's about two, three inches deep, and there's wires hanging down over your head. and so, you're army-crawling through it, and your head is hitting these wires, and they will occasionally will shock you, zap you. is it 10,000 volts? i don't - there's a difference between voltage and wattage, and i don't really understand what it is.    tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: but, one will kill you, and one won't. so, this is supposedly the stuff that won't kill you. but, if you get hit in just the right way, and you're in water - i got hit so hard, and my face smacked down through the water, and i hit my head. and then, i blacked out, i started crawling the wrong way. and, that was one of those things that, once you do that - something like that happens to you, you just have this insane fear of it.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and so, it's the worst for me now, trying to prep myself to do that.  tim ferriss: so, you just have the trepidation.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: beforehand.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: the people who get injured, or even the fatalities, what are the most common causes?  amelia boone: honestly, i think the vast majority of injuries are things like rolled ankles, broken ankles, you've fallen down things.  tim ferriss: so, what you would expect.  amelia boone: what you would expect. i don't think they've never - the one unfortunate death that we know of, that have occurred, or deaths that have occurred, have been heat stroke, dehydration, the things you find in -   tim ferriss: same that you would find in ultra marathon and marathon running.  amelia boone: exactly, exactly. it's not - surprisingly, for something that is fraught with electricity, and spears, and climbing up super tall things, and crawling through barbed wire, nobody has lost an eye, i don't think, from barbed wire.  tim ferriss: one of my buddies got zapped in the eye with one of those electric lines. he was not super happy about that.    amelia boone: i bet. the worst extent of my injuries are, really, my body is just covered in barbed wire scars and scratches. you can probably - i can show you them, but i look like i was attacked by a tiger.  tim ferriss: yeah. yeah, i was wondering what kind of cat you had.  amelia boone: yeah, yeah, yeah. it's everywhere; and rope burns. i'm never gonna be a leg model because it's just -   tim ferriss: fifty shades of tough mudder, yeah.  amelia boone: god, it's covered.  tim ferriss: the surgery. i wanna talk about your knee surgery.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: why did you get knee surgery? let's start with that, what was the reason for the knee surgery?  amelia boone: so, i, last summer, heading into world championship season, ended up tearing my meniscus, and -   tim ferriss: that was in training, in running, or - ?  amelia boone: it was in training. i was running in chicago, and there were pot holes everywhere. and, it was one of those freak things,w here you step in something, and you're like, \"ah! ah my leg!\" and then, i'm running it off, and i'm like, \"oh, wait. this actually isn't okay.\" so, i went and i had an mri, and i thought i was okay, but my leg kept locking and i had to physically unlock it, and with certain meniscus tears that happens. so, they had to go int heir and shave down the meniscus. and then, there were some tibial plateau fracture, or whatever fancy word. so, i just had to stay off of it for a bit, yeah.  tim ferriss: when did you - so, that happened; how much later did you compete?  amelia boone: so, i raced again eight weeks post-surgery. and, i remember asking my surgeon -   tim ferriss: this was the world's toughest mudder?  amelia boone: correct.    tim ferriss: 2014?  amelia boone: correct.  tim ferriss: but, you won.  amelia boone: i did. so, i remember asking my surgeon, \"so, how long until i'm back running?\" he was like, \"maybe four weeks.\" and, i go, \"so, could i feasibly run a race eight weeks later?\" he's like, \"yeah.\" and, i was like, \"how long of a race?\" because he was thinking like i was gonna run a 5k.  tim ferriss: do a 5k?  amelia boone: i was like, \"well, it's 24 hours.\" so, i never got his blessing for it, but i did it anyway.  tim ferriss: what did you do between the - what steps did you take to rehab it? what were the most important things that you did?  amelia boone: i think, most importantly for me was getting into - i got into physical therapy the next day. i had the best physical therapist in chicago, and she was fantastic. she had worked with me through other injuries, and things like that. so, we were pretty aggressive in rehab-ing it. and then, i just did whatever else i could to work around it, and stay in shape. i think when people get injured, they forget that there's so much that they still can do.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: so, i had a gym that had a skierg. which, if you've ever seen, is like a rower turned upside down, and you pull it like you're cross-country skiing. so, for two weeks that was the only thing i could really do to keep my heart rate up.  tim ferriss: so, a handbike, skierg -   amelia boone: handbike, skierg, i could row with one leg, but then that kind of throws - then my other leg, which is getting massive. but, i would do - i rowed a 10k, or i skierg'd a 10k, which is the worst kind of torture you can do to yourself. and, just finding other ways to work around it.  tim ferriss: what other rehab modalities did you find most helpful, personally?  amelia boone: i did a lot of stem, for - to get - because i think when you go and   you do -   tim ferriss: electrical stimulation.  amelia boone: electrical stimulation, yeah. so, when you go in and you cut open your knee, it shuts down your quad. so, the main thing is getting your quad to, then, come back and function again. and so, stem is really helpful in retraining that, to get it to fire.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: that was helpful. and, really i'm a huge fan of art, graston, all those.  tim ferriss: so, for people that are not familiar, art is active release technique, a type of myofascial release.  amelia boone: yes, correct.  tim ferriss: which is super - depending on how you have it done, can be super unpleasant if you're having your psoas worked on.  amelia boone: oh my god. i love that pain though. i think it's the coolest thing.  tim ferriss: you like having some therapist with their ridge hand knuckle deep into your psoas. i had, just as a side note - alright, i'm gonna give a shout-out to this guy, jesse birdick, who's a power lifter, who trains with a  friend of mine named mark bell. i mean, they do a lot of training separately. but, i think he pulls - and, jesse i apologize if i get this wrong, but he can dead lift more than 700 lbs.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: he's a big unit.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: and, we were getting ready to do - he also does manual therapieswe were getting ready to do an art session, and so he puts me on a table, drapes one leg off -   amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: - and he goes, \"the safe word is brisket.\" and then, just proceeds to annihilate my hips. so the basic idea folks, for those of you who   don't know, art - and, please correct me if i get this wrong.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: but, if you have adhesions, let's just say with scar tissue between adjacent tissues, you apply pressure, manual pressure - a therapist applies pressure between those tissues, and then has you perform motions, like an overhead, reaching movement for the lats, to break apart those adhesions.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: graston, which is like having really thick butter knives scraped all over you, is that it?  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: i read that you use something, and i'm embarrassed because i actually don't know what this is; dry-needling?  amelia boone: oh, yeah.  tim ferriss: what is that?  amelia boone: okay, so it's -   tim ferriss: sounds terrible.  amelia boone: so, it's apparently illegal in california, which is why you probably don't know what it is. it's like acupuncture on crack.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: so, acupuncturists actually, rightfully probably, hate it because i think that they think it's kind of a bastardization of what they do.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: but, when you go and you get acupuncture, and the goal is not to feel the needle, dry-needling you actually are sticking the needle in the muscle valley to try to get it to twitch. and, the twitch is the release. so, it's like - and, you don't leave the needles in there. so, you're basically poking at a muscle to try and get -   tim ferriss: just a sowing machine.    amelia boone: yeah. and, the worst ever, don't ever let anybody dry-needle your calf or your gastrocnemius because if you get in underneath right at the hamstring insertion you will feel like you got shot in the back of your legs. but, it can also be kind of addictive because you have somebody poking around in your glutus medius, and you feel this twitch, and it's almost like this release of the muscle, and -   tim ferriss: what does it do for you?  amelia boone: it's supposed to - for super tight muscles the idea is to get it to release.  tim ferriss: release spasms?  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: huh.  amelia boone: so, yeah.  tim ferriss: i had the - i had this nutty experience. and, if people wanna see photos of me in excruciating pain, getting art done by charles poliquin, you can see that in the 4-hour body; it's kind of hilarious. but, i had a separate experience with something called - let's see, i guess it would be called - i wanna say neuropuncture, but i might be getting that wrong. this was done with dr. lee wolfer many years ago, with shallow injections of prolo solution.  amelia boone: oh, yeah.  tim ferriss: and, what happened though, and we improvised at this point, is she was working on my infraspinatus. this sis rotator cuff muscle that always get sore for me.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: and, i had reconstructive shoulder surgery, and i probably sit with chest collapsed, like gollum, when i'm typing also.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: which is no good. but, she was working on my infraspinatus, and she was doing the sowing machine approach, with these shallow injections. and, we both hear, \"kkch, kkch.\" and, it sounded like someone was scraping ice off of a windshield.    amelia boone: oh my god.  tim ferriss: and, it turned out that i had these - just this huge clump of calcium deposits at the back of both shoulders. so, we ended up just - well, we. it's a royal we. she ended up using the needle, basically, as a scraper to kind of break down these calcium deposits. and, what was fascinating is i had no shoulder pain for months afterward.  amelia boone: huh.  tim ferriss: after chiseling these out. it wasn't the most pleasant thing in the world.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: so, the dry-needling. now that you're here in california no more - sad times. no more glutus medius pokes.  amelia boone: i'm gonna have to go back to my -   tim ferriss: black market dry-needling.  amelia boone: well, sometimes i'll get acupuncture done, and i'll be like, \"can you guys...\" and, accidentally a muscle will trigger and releaseand i'm like, \"oh, that's fantastic, do it again.\" but, i'm one of those people. i'll try anything once, in terms of recovery.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: i'll just throw the - especially because for most professional athletes, what they do, their job is to be a professional athlete, and then to rehab and recover, and spend all that time. i'm training early in the mornings, i go and sit at a desk for ten hours a day, and then i try to train again in the evenings. it's not an ideal - i'm not doing my body any favors with what i'm putting it through. tim ferriss: what does your nutrition look like? were you serious earlier when i asked you about breakfast?  amelia boone: yes.  tim ferriss: what was your answer? we were doing a sound check and i asked her what she had for breakfast. what was your answer?  amelia boone: pop-tarts.    tim ferriss: pop-tarts.  amelia boone: no, that's actually - so, pop-tarts have become this running joke in the obstacle racing community with me because when i won the spartan race world championships in 2013 i was so far ahead. i was 20 or 30 minutes ahead of the next woman. and, the race director yells out at me, \"milly, what did you have for breakfast this morning?\" and, i actually did, randomly, that day because they're a really good source of easy digestible carbs.  tim ferriss: milly? is that what you said? or, did he say your full name? sorry, i heard milly.  amelia boone: sorry, he said amelia. sometimes, i can't say my own name. and, it kind of became this thing. i would just - pre-race ritual - that it would be a good luck thing to have a pop-tart.  tim ferriss: yeah, sure.  amelia boone: because i'm really into superstition. and, it's kind of grown from there. and, now i see - i was at a race the other weekend, and everyone around me was eating pop-tarts. and, i'm like, \"what have i started? what?\" and then, everyone posts these pictures on instagram of them eating pop-tarts, and they tag me in it. and, i'm like, \"oh my god, i've created a monster.\"  tim ferriss: well, this actually could be an incredible opportunity for you to do whatever you want because i remember watching pumping iron, and arnold schwarzenegger's talking about the guys who would come up to him and ask him for advice, and he'd give them the wrong advice. and, he would tell them to go into the shower at the gym and scream while they're posing. so, you could actually -   amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: you could pull and incredible april fool's joke, but announce it a year later.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: after everyone has already embraced it.  amelia boone: i know. so, now i'm like, \"okay. well, what's the next thing?\"  tim ferriss: what other superstitions do you have? not limited to racing necessarily, just curious.    amelia boone: yeah. i'm one of those people that - so, it's the same - i will wear the same sports bra. so, we race, pretty much, in a sports bra and compression shorts because you want as little clothing, to hold down the mud, as possible. so, i'll wear the same - if i did well in a race, i'll wear the same outfit for the next race.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and, especially the same headband. and then, if i don't do well, then that one gets discarded. so, it's that kind of, typical sports stuff  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: i actually have - this is kind of embarrassing, but - a small, little, stuffed dog that travels with me to all races because i'm typically by myself in really cheap, sketchy hotels.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: because these races are in the middle of nowhere. so, it's my little guard dog.  tim ferriss: how big is the stuffed dog?  amelia boone: oh, it fits in the palm of your hand.  tim ferriss: where did you get that?  amelia boone: it was given to me as a gift.  tim ferriss: as a protection.  amelia boone: as a protection.  tim ferriss: as a guardian.  amelia boone: as a guard dog. so, yeah. it's just silly stuff like that.  tim ferriss: outside of pop-tarts -   amelia boone: yeah, what do i actually eat?  tim ferriss: yeah. what is your - let's just say you're four weeks out from a race.    amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: what does a day of food look like for you?  amelia boone: that's hard to say. honestly, it's one of those things i've struggled with, that i've tried everything. i tried to do paleo, i tried to be like, \"maybe i can become a fat-adapted athlete,\" because for longer races i didn't want to have to rely on gels and [inaudible] -   tim ferriss: gels, right.  amelia boone: - and stuff like that because after awhile it can be too much on your stomach. but, i just never - i'm never gonna be the paradigm of good eating, of - and, i couldn't stick with the whole trying to - i couldn't go far enough into the fat adaptation. i was just miserable. i like ice cream way too much.  tim ferriss: somewhat counter indicated for ketosis and fat adaption.  amelia boone: exactly, exactly.  tim ferriss: much too much sugar [inaudible].  amelia boone: at a certain point, i think i realized that i'm performing well, i'm winning races, so why change? if it gets to the point where i'm not doing well -   tim ferriss: performing.  amelia boone: then i'll take another look at my diet and switch it.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: but, at this point, it's - i run so much, i put in so much time that i'm like, \"whatever. i enjoy food and i'll eat whatever.\"  tim ferriss: what do you consume during a 24 hour race? what is your - and, this is actually a question from a fan.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: which was, \"how does your gear that you bring with you differ in an obstacle course race versus an ultra marathon,\" for instance?  amelia boone: yeah.    tim ferriss: aside from the wet suit.  amelia boone: yeah. so, i think it really depends. if you're running, as i've learned from dabbling in ultra marathons, is that my body doesn't - especially if you're running hard, my body isn't gonna handle solid food as well as  - the stomach will - stomach acid and stuff like that. so, there's a lot of liquid. tailwind is good, something that a lot of people use, that's easy on your stomach.  tim ferriss: tailwind? that's a good name  amelia boone: yeah, yeah, yeah. but, i also just find simple - i actually really love chewing on things. clif makes these blocks. so, i do. i take in simple sugars that fuel me through that. i will -   tim ferriss: how often do you eat during a 24 hour race?  amelia boone: i try and fuel every 30 minutes to an hour; get something in, but in little bits.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and then, i'm telling you, sometimes the best things during a long race are - i had a krispy kreme doughnut during world's toughest mudder this past year, and it was the most phenomenal thing i'd ever had. salty things; you wanna make sure that your electrolytes are keeping - especially if you're running in a wet suit because you're losing -   tim ferriss: you must be losing so much - such an incredible amount of fluids.  amelia boone: yeah. so, pickle juice, mustard, things like that.  tim ferriss: but, do you carry that with you, or are there stations where you can get that?  amelia boone: there are stations, there are -   tim ferriss: i'm just imagining a camel back, half full with pickle juice.  amelia boone: well, i actually do, i carry mustard packets with me, small packets.  tim ferriss: mustard packets?  amelia boone: because vinegar, if you ever have issues with cramping, they say   that the vinegar, the salt, stuff like that can - pickle juice is well known to stop cramps in their tracks.  tim ferriss: huh. pickle juice, i suppose that makes sense.  amelia boone: yeah, yeah. pickle juice is harder to carry with you.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: unless you have a little vial, or something like that. but, yeah. so, i think that for the longer the race gets, you obviously need more gear. especially depending on the cold, and the weather, and what your conditions are. and so, sometimes it's pretty massive.  tim ferriss: you mentioning electrolytes - it's fascinating when you look at the record of health issues in endurance races, most people assume a lot of it would be related to dehydration, but often times it's the complete opposite.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: where a lot of people, many people, consume too much water.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: and, they get - i guess it's -   amelia boone: hyponatremia, yeah.  tim ferriss: hyponatremia, where you dilute sodium to the extent that in some cases, your heart stops functioning.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: and, the - i recall i was doing this kettle bell certification years ago, and it was just thousands and thousands of swings and whatnot, outside in minnesota. and, people were getting horrible cramps, and they were like, \"oh, we're not drinking enough water, we need to drink more water.\"  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: i'm like, \"no, that's not the issue. you need some potassium tablets.\"  amelia boone: mm-hmm.    tim ferriss: and, it's - but, god. that could just be the worst.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: do people - i would imagine there must be a fair number of competitors who just have to drop out because they get quad or hamstring cramps. or is that - ?  amelia boone: yeah, cramps can be super debilitating, and i think - and, especially in really hot races, and also in really cold races, in the extremes. so, it happens. it's the reason why the longer the race is, the more unknown things that do into it. it can be - it's always kind of a crap shoot. you're like, \"come on body, please cooperate with me this one time.\" but, sometimes you can't predict it, so.  tim ferriss: what supplements do you use on a daily basis?  amelia boone: caffeine. no, i like coffee. so, i am actually, really - have really bought the hype and the science behind beets.  tim ferriss: beets, yeah.  amelia boone: so, i work with a company called beet-a-leet which is powdered beet, concentrated beet.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and so, it's really that - and, if you - i remember the first time i ever had beet juice, which just tastes like death, like dirt. some people like bee juice, but i can't handle it. but, you feel this weird head rush, almost.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and so, i was like, \"oh, there might be something to this shit.\" so, it's - so, i am really - it's something that i actually drink every - before work outs, and stuff like that. and, it delivers the nitric oxide to help with breathing, and everything like that. so, i think for endurance athletes, you don't need - i don't need the massive dose of caffeine before i go out and run because who wants to be jittery while running for several hours? you need more of the help with the breathing, and with keeping the  heart rate low, and stuff like that.   and then, i also take - i try to stay away from anti-inflammatories,   like advil, and stuff like that, just because it's hard on the bodybut, i'm a big believer in turmeric.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: and, other things like that. then anything to try and help with bones and joints.  tim ferriss: so, do you just take glucosamine, or msm, or what type of stuff?  amelia boone: yeah, but try to get in natural; bone broth, gelatin, things like that.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: but, bone broth is an expensive habit, until i bite the bullet and make my own. but, then i have to handle chicken feet, and i'm not really into that, so.  tim ferriss: you're in a good place for the bone broth, in the bay area.  amelia boone: i know.  tim ferriss: what is it, three stone hearth, i think, in berkeley.  amelia boone: yeah, yeah, yeah.  tim ferriss: and, further down the peninsula you got some really good sources as well.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: fortunately.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: hippies love bone broth.  amelia boone: oh, god. it's the new thing, so yeah.  tim ferriss: and, for anybody in new york, i'll just give a shout-out to a new - i guess it's kind of a side gig, started by a chef friend of mine, marco canora, who is in the 4-hour chef; brodo. they serve hot bone broth in the winters, in new york city. brodo, it's amazing.  amelia boone: that's sick.    tim ferriss: and, you can get turmeric or cumin; you get different flavors.  amelia boone: oh, yeah. yeah, you put things actually -   tim ferriss: yeah. you can pay for the add-ons. what does your pre-hab routine look like? so, the exercises. what exercises do you do to prevent injuries?  amelia boone: yeah. so, the main injuries that i've kind of dealt with have always been revolving around hips and gluts; like most runners, gluts that don't fire.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: so, i -   tim ferriss: the irony.  amelia boone: yeah,yeah, yeah. exactly. so, jane fonda's are the gold standardbut, it's a lot of stability work. so, i try to do a lot of single leg stuff.  tim ferriss: what type of single leg stuff?  amelia boone: so, single leg squats. you see cross fitters do pistols all the way, ass to ground. you don't need to do that kind of stuff. you just do small, little, mini single leg squats.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: i try and do - whenever i'm standing around, i'm trying to just stand on one leg, and balancing, and things like that. i do a lot of band -  the physio-band walks. so, monster walks.  tim ferriss: yeah, or the x walks.  amelia boone: yeah, the x walks, that kind of stuff. and then, a lot of work - especially as a trail runner, you really wanna work you - what is it, your transverse abdominus?  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: the really deep, core muscles.  tim ferriss: corset muscle.    amelia boone: yeah, yeah, yeah. so, a lot of exercises that will engage that, like bird dogs, and things like that. they're super not fun, and little tiny movements, but i think most people would rather go squat 200 lbsand ignore those, and that's not gonna help you.  tim ferriss: so, you're working on glutus medius; you're doing isolateral, or single leg movements; do you do step-ups, any work on boxes?  amelia boone: i do. i do two, i think, and lunges. things like that. anything that's requiring you to - that's requiring that unilateral movement, yeah.  tim ferriss: and, how much time would you say yo spend on those types of pre-hab movements on a weekly basis?  amelia boone: it's probably about 12 to 20 minutes a day.  tim ferriss: okay. 15 to 20 a day. and, do you so that pre-workout?\" is it a separate workout, or after?  amelia boone: generally i'll do a few activation ones, like fire hydrants, beforeand then, it's generally afterwards that i'll devote 15, 20 minutes to those small, little, strengthening baby exercises.  tim ferriss: and, how many miles, on average, do you run per week?  amelia boone: it's actually changed a lot. i used to - a few years ago, i actually didn't really put in that much mileage. i was like, \"running too much is not good for you,\" or whatever. i've switched my training to be more running intensive because i realized that if you're gonna run for 24 hours, you  probably should run.  tim ferriss: be good at running?  amelia boone: exactly because i always used to joke, i'm like, \"i'm not a runner,\" but then i realized that i actually love running on trails, and i love long, long runs. now, i'm probably putting in 60, 70 miles a weekwhich actually is not that much for -   tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: you see a lot of runners who put in 100 mile weeks, but -  tim ferriss: 60, 70 miles a week.  amelia boone: yeah.    tim ferriss: and, how much time do you spend doing other types of training, like weight training, or otherwise?  amelia boone: yeah. i do - i generally will cross fit three to four days a week.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: or, some kind of bastardized version of my own, if i'm not actually gonna make it to a cross fit gym. it's also because i pick and choose what i like to do from that.  tim ferriss: right.  amelia boone: so, i guess it would be, probably, five to six other hours of strength training, interval training, things like that.  tim ferriss: what is your morning routine, or routines, look like; first 60 minutes of your day.  amelia boone: first 60 minutes.  tim ferriss: so, you wake up, punch the roosters, make them crow, 4 a.m-   amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: what happens - what does your day look like between, say, 4 a.mand 5:30 a.m.?  amelia boone: yeah. i wish i could give you an answer that's like, \"i go out and i do sun salutations, or breathing exercises.\" well, the sun's not even out at that hour.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: but, it's nothing really that interesting. i wake up, i'll - generally, at that point, i'll typically answer some work emails that, since i got to bed pretty early -   tim ferriss: what times do you go to bed?  amelia boone: probably - i try to get in bed by 9 p.m.. so, sometimes i'll have work emails that will come in later than that, so i'll answer thoseand then, i'm just gathering everything up and heading out to - if i'm going to the gym that day, or if i'm hitting up the trails that dayso - because i'll typically train in the morning, and then i'll get ready and go straight into work.    tim ferriss: what time do you get to work?  amelia boone: about 7:30 a.m. or so. and so -   tim ferriss: mm-hmm. now, have you eaten breakfast at this point, or no?  amelia boone: i will eat - so, generally - so, i'll wake up in the morning -   tim ferriss: pop-tarts, right?  amelia boone: no, just race days, and this morning because it was the only thing in the trunk of my car as i was driving up here. i had ten pop-tarts in the trunk of my car. but, i'll generally wake up, and i actually, typically, eat a few spoonfuls of nut butter to fuel before i go out. for if i'm gonna go run 10, 15 miles, it's a good source of fuel to keep me going.   tim ferriss: so, you'll just have a few tablespoons of almond butter, or something like that?  amelia boone: pretty much. and, i found out that it sits well. and then, i'll eat breakfast after i train, and then get to the office, things like that.  tim ferriss: so, what does a non-pop-tart breakfast look like?  amelia boone: oh, generally, i'm a big fan of omelets, and eggs, and things like that in the morning. mainly because i really like ketchup, and i always put ketchup on eggs.  tim ferriss: it's just a vehicle for the ketchup.  amelia boone: pretty much. and so, you sense a sugar theme going on here.  tim ferriss: let's -   amelia boone: don't take diet advice from amelia.  tim ferriss: i want to just take a few of these fan questions -   amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: and, we've hit on a number of them already, but -   amelia boone: i didn't know i had fans, but -     tim ferriss: yes you did.  amelia boone: unless they're all coming from scott.  tim ferriss: you have a lot of fans, among my fans. this is a question that i would be interested to hear the answer to as well. this is from cindy polluein, i'm probably massacring that; what is your self talk during training, and during the challenges, sound like? the moment when you want to quit. now, just to head this off with the pass, the answer may be that you don't feel like you want to quit.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: but, during extremely hard races, or challenging times, what does your self talk look like?  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: because i found many athletes, maybe not you, have consistent routines in terms of their self talk.  amelia boone: so, what's interesting, especially with long races, is that you're always going to hit a low part, and there's always going to be a part where you want to quit. you know, 24 hours - and, for me it generally comes early. it's like four hours in, and i'm like, \"god, i got to do this for 20 more hours.\"  tim ferriss: another 20 hours.  amelia boone: the sun's setting, and it's getting cold. the wind's picking up, there's a massive sandstorm, whatever. for me, i think i generally - it's hard because people ask me about self talk, and i generally just shut my brain off. and, i feel that that's what keeps - i don't really think about anything, but i think when -   tim ferriss: has that always been the case?  amelia boone: i think so, i think that -   tim ferriss: and, do you just will that into being?  amelia boone: i think i just go. well, i use different coping techniques. i sing to myself a lot when i'm out there.  tim ferriss: please tell me you sing out loud. no?    amelia boone: sometimes, yes.  tim ferriss: really?  amelia boone: yeah. if i have enough breath.  tim ferriss: yeah, yeah.  amelia boone: so, yeah. there will be a certain song for every race, that will just replay through my head. so, 2012 world's toughest mudder was macklemore's \"thrift shop\". it was right before it hit big. no, right before it busted out, and i swear to god, i sang that song over and over again, and i can't listen to it the same way anymore.  tim ferriss: what other songs - so, that was like you mantra, was macklemore?  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: that was like you meditative mantra.  amelia boone: pretty much, for 24 hours.  tim ferriss: for 24 hours, that's dedication. what other songs have you used?  amelia boone: oh, god. they range all of the place. sometimes, it's just - i'll sing - so, my favorite hymn ever is - i was raised catholic, or whatever, and i love, i've always loved church music. so, there's a christmas song, \"lo, how a rose e'er blooming,\" it's an old hymn.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: so, not at all what you would think would be running through my head, running a race. but, sometimes it does. but then, this other race it was kanye. it was kanye's \"monster\", the song was called \"monster.\"  tim ferriss: do other racers do that as well, that you're aware of? or, do - do any other top racers have coping approaches that you think are interesting?  amelia boone: you know, i think that a lot of people have that self talk. i've always tried to - and i think this is pretty common. a lot of us will try to break up the race into small segments because if you look at   the whole picture, it will get overwhelming. if you're like, \"i have 100 miles to run,\" you think, \"crap.\" but, if you're like, \"no i only have three miles,\" or, \"i'm just gonna focus on getting through these next ten minutes.\" and so, i've always found that a lot of people who do long endurance events will break it up into small manageable chunks, and just focus on the next few minutes ahead of them.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and, i think that works pretty well.  tim ferriss: do you - i mean, it sounds like you probably have some form of meditation when you run, and i think in terms of just mindfulness, i'm sure it's a very present state of mind to start with. but, do you have a separate meditative practice of any type?  amelia boone: i don't. i've tried. i went to this retreat thing, that was fantastic, and i tried to do this meditation session, and i just - 20 minutes in, i was like, \"i gotta move, and do something, and get out of here.\" so, for me it's almost like the meditation is like working really hard. like sprinting, or running, or lifting heavy weights. that's like my yoga practice, you know?  tim ferriss: mm-hmm. now, i don't know what this refers to, but since will hicks is asking: are you going to do the 24 hour battle frog in march? does that mean anything to you?  amelia boone: it does, yes.  tim ferriss: okay.  amelia boone: it's a race. it's another 24 hour obstacle race. you know, maybe. i don't know. my schedule next year is kind of up in the air. i really want to venture, and challenge myself in new ways. and so, i think i'm going to be doing a lot more pure trail races too.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: which i haven't really had a chance - especially being out here in california, it's much better. i love climbing, running up mountains, stuff like that. so, we'll see.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm. why did you decide to move to california?  amelia boone: a variety of reasons. i think the main one was, i'm from the west   coast, and i wanted to get back here. and then, it was time for a transition in a career for me. i had been at a law firm for six years, and it was great, and they were fantastic. but, i kind of wanted to try a new - going in-house, and working for a company there   and then - actually, i'll be honest, it's totally the training. and, having mountains and hills around me. it was really hard - i am the happiest when i am out on a mountain, running around somewhere, and i couldn't do that in chicago, so.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm. are you able to disclose the company that you're working for?  amelia boone: yes, so - it's this tiny little company, you may have heard of it, maybe not, i don't know. i work for apple, yeah.  tim ferriss: it's a good company. i have a lot of friends at the mothership. just wanted to make sure they would allow you to at least admit that you work there.  amelia boone: i mean, it's on my linkedin and facebook profile, so it's not -   tim ferriss: okay, so then it's public.  amelia boone: yeah, yeah, yeah.  tim ferriss: this is a very racing specific question. stephen mckee: how do you keep your body limber, after ice or water immersion, during a race?  amelia boone: keep moving.  tim ferriss: just keep moving.  amelia boone: yeah. otherwise, when you slow down that's when your body temperature goes downand then, you're gonna get hypothermic.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm. so, let's go to the third act.  amelia boone: okay.  tim ferriss: which is rapid fire question. they don't have to be rapid fire answers. but, the word successful.  amelia boone: yes.    tim ferriss: when you hear the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind, and why?  amelia boone: god, that's so hard because i - this is gonna be your typical lawyer answer, where i'm like, \"because successful can have so many different definitions.\"  tim ferriss: no, no. that's fair though, but just, sort of, reflexively.  amelia boone: so, this is gonna be kind of a strange answer, probably. but, i always find people who have transitioned their careers throughout their - who've had - i guess, who've been flexible in their careers, and who have transitioned - that answer is not coming out rightokay, here we go. i'm gonna use an example.  tim ferriss: i do that all the time, don't worry. i was trying to record a 20 second intro for this little audio book yesterday.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: and, it probably took me 47 takes.  amelia boone: right, because you're all -   tim ferriss: so, the example.  amelia boone: yeah, so. i'm going to give you an example of a person who i find successful, and then i'll explain why.  tim ferriss: perfect.  amelia boone: triple h.  tim ferriss: triple h?  amelia boone: so, i am a huge wrestling fan, huge professional wrestling fanand, the reason why i'm gonna use it - and i could use a number of people as this example. but, the reason i'm gonna use this is because i find people who have had one - so, he had a very successful wrestling career, but then transitioned to the business aspect of it. you find so many people in it. this is interesting, being - i guess you could technically call me, kind of, a  professional athlete. you see a lot of people, who i find, are very short-sighted in that. in that they're like, \"well, i'm racing now,\" but they don't think about what happens when they can no longer do that.     so, people who have been able to have a very successful athletic career, and then transition to the business side of things, or to think far ahead; those are the people i look to, that i'm like, \"they have everything.\" they have the athletic side of it, but then they also have the business acumen, and are smart enough to know that their body isn't going to always be there for them.  tim ferriss: last forever. yeah. oscar de la hoya is a good example too, with golden boy productions.  amelia boone: mm-hmm. right.  tim ferriss: very savvy.  amelia boone: if we want to keep going with professional wrestling; the rock. he transitioned to be an actor, you know?  tim ferriss: yeah, he's done alright.  amelia boone: so -   tim ferriss: triple h is a great example though. so, paul levesque.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: really smart guy.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: i had him on the podcast.  amelia boone: i listened to it.  tim ferriss: oh, it just blew my mind.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: really, really, really savvy guy.  amelia boone: right, right.  tim ferriss: okay, so triple h. i agree. i also view him - he works out at, i think, midnight every day, with joe defranco, after his entire -   amelia boone: right.    tim ferriss: he has very -  you guys have -  amelia boone: okay, so we're the opposite. and, he's going to bed.  tim ferriss: right, you have the opposite schedules.  amelia boone: but, he's also a big fan of routine, which i know and i've heard him talk about, too. and, that's how i get by. i don't care where i am in life; if i'm traveling, if i'm on the road for work. i'm going to  create a routine there and stick with it.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: that's how you survive.  tim ferriss: what is something you believe, that other people think is insane? or, any controversial beliefs that you have?  amelia boone: interesting.  tim ferriss: and, if nothing jumps to mind, we can also come back to that.  amelia boone: right. yeah, i may need to come back to that one.  tim ferriss: okay, we'll come back to that. what book or books have you gifted most to other people?  amelia boone: i'm gonna butcher this authors' name because i always do. house of leaves.  tim ferriss: house of leaves.  amelia boone: by mark danielewski.  tim ferriss: uh-huh.  amelia boone: so, the reason that i say this, and that i would gift this, is that so many people now read on kindles, or technology, or things like that. this is a book that you have to hold because there are parts of it where  you need to turn it upside down to read it. and, i forgot the style of writing, there's actually a genre for it. but, there are certain pages where, you are reading it and it turns in a circle. so, it's in an entire - i think that reading a book, and holding the physical book, and turning the pages, is such a lost art. and so, there's something - this is a book that's an entire sensory   experience.  it's a fantastic story. it's brilliant, it's kind of like a story within a story. but then, it requires you, as a reader, to be active and involved. and, i think that's just so cool because you don't see stuff like that anymore. and, especially now, when read things on their ipads, or their kindles, or whatever. and, holding a book is something that we no longer do.  tim ferriss: house of leaves.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: very cool. do you have any favorite documentaries, or movies?  amelia boone: my all time favorite movie is the goonies.  tim ferriss: the goonies. it's a quality film.  amelia boone: it's a quality - it's not life changing, but -   tim ferriss: any favorite character from the goonies?  amelia boone: data.  tim ferriss: data. data was great.  amelia boone: [inaudible] yeah. i grew up in oregon, you just had to. that was my jam, you know?  tim ferriss: the goonies.  amelia boone: we didn't have much to claim, being from oregon.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: but, we could claim that movie.  tim ferriss: what is the purchase, for less than $100, that is most positively impacted your life, in recent memory?  amelia boone: this is really funny. so, manuka honey bandages.  tim ferriss: huh.  amelia boone: and so, i get banged up a lot, racing.    tim ferriss: yeah, i've seen. yeah, there's some of the photos that you sent me -   amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: so, before we do these interviews i ask for a short bio, some photos that might be usable. and, i was looking at one of them: you're climbing up this ramp, and you're just covered in blood. so, yes. you get banged up.   amelia boone: so, this past summer, i actually - there's this one obstacle called tyrolean traverse.  tim ferriss: what's it called?  amelia boone: tyrolean traverse.  tim ferriss: tyrolean.  amelia boone: yeah. so, you've seen the military guys, they - it's a rope thingyou either go under it -   tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: it's just a rope traverse.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: but, you can also go on top of it, it saves your grip. and, i decided one day, one race, to go on top of it, saving my grip, and i was wearing just a sports bra. and, massive rope burn all down the front of my - and, the worst pain. it was like a second degree burnand, i discovered that the only thing that would take away the sting were these honey bandages. cvs was the only place that sold them.  tim ferriss: cvs has manuka honey bandages?  amelia boone: - honey bandages. the only place. i could find them online too. i swear, it was the only thing that got me through the next few weeks with no pain, but, now i use them all the time for all of my scrapes. they're great antibacterial blah, blah, blah. with the number that i bought, i'm sure it's over - i've spent way more than $100 on them, but -     tim ferriss: manuka honey bandages, cool. now, i usually ask about morning routines, we already covered quite a bit of that. what other routines, or habits do you find important in your day, or week?  amelia boone: i - it's very easy for me to - or, i think it's very easy for a lot of people to get disconnected from people around them. especially now, when our social media type of world - is that you like something on instagram, or favorite something on twitter, or whatever. whatever the things are that you do. so, it's very important for me to - i always set a time every single week, and i call my parents at the same time.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and, i call my sister, to try and make those personal connections, and stuff like that. because it can be so impersonal now with everything that we have; technology where you can be friends with people that you've never met in real life. so, i always try to - for me, that routine. every sunday, at the same time calling the parents. just kind of keeping me grounded, things like that.  tim ferriss: do you have any wind down routine? what does the hour before bed look like?  amelia boone: so, i generally -   tim ferriss: can't wait to hear this.  amelia boone: no, i was just trying to think of if i actually have - because generally i'll be watching monday night raw, or some other professional wrestling. i don't watch a lot of tv, but it's either sports, or professional wrestling when i do. i am, generally, one of those people that is so tired by the time it's time to go to bed, that i don't really need a routine.  tim ferriss: you don't have any necessity.  amelia boone: it's just, alright it's time to go to bed. done.  tim ferriss: out cold.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: got it. if you could have a billboard anywhere, what would it say? you can put anything on it.    amelia boone: i think i would say - i think it would be something along the lines of, \"no one owes you anything.\" and, i think that this has been something that, lately, i feel that there's such a level of entitlement now in people. that, \"i deserve this,\" or, \"i blah, blah, blah this.\" and, at the end of the day it's hard work. the people that i find the most successful people, that i - one thing i've always prided myself on is, i've worked, really goddamn hard for everything that i've gotten, or that i've done in my life.   and, you can't expect handouts from people. at the end of the day, all that you can count on, really, is yourself. and so, i don't expect people to give me anything. and, i really wish - you see people now - i don't know. the level of entitlement that people think that they deserve a handout, or deserve help sometimes. sometimes, i'm like, \"no, make it yourself. make your own opportunities.\"  tim ferriss: yeah. that's very pronounced here in silicon valley too. it's like, \"i know you just had a great idea when you went to the bathroom, but it's not worth $50 million yet, i'm sorry.\"  amelia boone: yeah. exactly.  tim ferriss: so, this is not one of my normal rapid fire questions, and i'm sure i'm gonna get a lot of grief for this from my fans. but, i have to ask because i know a lot of very successful women, ceo's, and so on2012, second place overall -   amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: you could have, potentially - it's well within the realm of possibility that you could've won the whole thing.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: do you find it hard to date? is it - because i'm imagining.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: if i put myself in your shoes, it must be - and you're extremely successful in your career. is it hard for you to find someone you respect enough to date? i mean, in the mental, physical, emotional toughness spheres?  amelia boone: so, i don't think that it's so much me - here's the thing.  tim ferriss: that's how it always starts.    amelia boone: it's not me, it's him. no. i honestly - i tend to be attracted to be people that are almost - i don't want to say the exact opposite of me because then that sounds like i'm attracted to people who aren't successful. but, what i've found is that i need somebody who is very complimentary to me in terms of very, kind of - i admire people that are super laid back, and go with the flow, and very adaptable, and just everything that i'm not.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: and so, i think that for me it's not so hard to find people like that. i think sometimes you do get - you'll hear - it takes a certain type of guy who can be secure with being with a woman who beats 99% of the dudes at a sport, or whatever.  tim ferriss: sure.  amelia boone: and, that feels weird to say because that feels like i'm being like, \"look at me, i'm some badass.\"  tim ferriss: no, no, no. the facts are the facts.  amelia boone: but, it's - i think that it takes a guy who is very secure in his own right. i can't date somebody who is not secure in who he is.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: because then that would just be disastrous.  tim ferriss: doesn't sound like it would get very far.  amelia boone: nah.  tim ferriss: what advice would you give your 25-year-old self, and place us - 20 and 25. i'd be interested to get it for both ages.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: so, where were you, what were you doing at 20, and then 25?  amelia boone: so, 20 i was finishing up college, probably just getting ready to apply to law school; super hardcore, drive, i was going to be a partner at a law firm one day. all of those things. i think, at that time, i would tell myself to relax, and that you can't predict where life is going to take you.    tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: because now, looking back, would i ever expect that i would be the world's top obstacle racer -  we didn't even know what the fuck obstacle - it wasn't even around at that time.  tim ferriss: it wasn't even a thing, yeah.  amelia boone: it wasn't even a thing. and so, i think at 25, i was finishing up law school, and i was starting my career as an attorney. so, it would probably be similar. but, i think what i would tell - i'm actually gonna give you what i would tell my 28-year-old self.  tim ferriss: perfect.  amelia boone: which is when i started all of this obstacle racing stuff. and, i would tell myself, \"it really doesn't matter.\" no. okay, that sounds bad but, \"don't take it so seriously.\" and, at the end of the -   tim ferriss: the racing itself.  amelia boone: the racing itself because when you reach - it started out as totally fun, and then you reach a certain level of success, and then everyone - then it becomes this pressure, and everything like thatand, i think that it's not - all of the stress, and the pressure, and everything that i would put on myself from it, it's not worth it. it doesn't change the outcome. i'm either ready, or i'm not to beat somebody. so, at the end of the day, keep it all in perspective   and, it's kind of hilarious. i'm running around in the mud, being shocked by electrical things, and running around for 24 hours in a wet suit. just keep that in perspective.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: it's kind of ludicrous what i'm doing. so, have fun with it.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: because there's so much time that i think that i've wasted, putting so much pressure on myself, and not having fun. and now, i've come full circle, and i'm like, \"eh, it's just fun.\"  tim ferriss: who would you - who is someone, or who are people, you would like to meet someday? if any are?    amelia boone: god, see that list is massive.  tim ferriss: yeah. who is up at the top of the list?  amelia boone: ronda rousey.  tim ferriss: ronda rousey, yeah.  amelia boone: i like to meet strong - i have an entire list of strong females who are at the top of what they do.  tim ferriss: yeah, she's on my list too.  amelia boone: but then, that also extends to other things that are not athletically inclined. so, you see charlotte sandburg, and the females that have made names for themselves as top executives, and things like that. i'm not a, \"rah, rah, girl power,\" type of person, but finding other women like that, and seeing what makes them tick, and seeing how they survive is always really interesting for me.  tim ferriss: what, if any, asks or requests do you have for the audience? and, this is the last question.  amelia boone: asks or requests.  tim ferriss: yeah, anything you'd like them to do, or think about, or consider, or all of the above.  amelia boone: right. i think  that one of things that i've learned, and what i would tell people, is to be open to experiences,. especially with - they're probably - people, if they're sitting here listening to this, are either already into obstacle course racing, and are like, \"man, this shit's bananas, it's great,\" and i don't need to convince them of anythingor, if they've happened upon this, and they're like, \"we don't understand what this chick is doing, actually.\" i don't know. i would say, go out there and try something new.  tim ferriss: mm-hmm.  amelia boone: so, if you wanna go out and run an obstacle course race, greatbut, i wouldn't' be where i am today without just saying, \"sure,\" and trying something. and, seeing where that leads me. so, i think that's always important to keep in mind.  tim ferriss: try something new.    amelia boone: yeah, yeah.  tim ferriss: that's good advice. do something -   amelia boone: and, i'm not asking them to do something there, right?  tim ferriss: no, no, no. i think that's good advice. do something just for the fuck of it.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: i think it's - coming back to your, \"don't take it so seriously,\" not everything has to figure into your five year plan.  amelia boone: right. and, that's hard because for me, i've always been that, super planner, five year person  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: so, it's something that i have to actually remind myself. \"try something new, amelia.\" just do it.  tim ferriss: yeah.  amelia boone: why not do it?  tim ferriss: that  was one of my - i'm not gonna call it a resolution because it wasn't a new years resolution, but i did a lot of unusual experiments last year that we won't get into right now. but, one of the realizations was, be playful.  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: you don't have to be so goddamn serious about things all of the time. just do something that doesn't have an explicit point, or and angle.  amelia boone: right.  tim ferriss: or, whatever it might be.  amelia boone: well, somebody told me the other day, that the only thing - at the end of the day, the only thing we have is time   if you really cut through all the bullshit out there - and this is so   funny. when you were asking me about, \"who do you think is successful?\" seriously, i think the most successful people out there are people that are happy, that are just - they may not have it allthey may be dirt poor, they may not be educated, they may whatever. but, if they can start everyday of life smiling, and just generally happy - if you break it all down, all we have is time, so why spend it being miserable?   so, go do something that makes you happy, and have fun with it because you're not taking it with you when you go.  tim ferriss: yeah. your most valuable, non-renewable resource.  amelia boone: exactly.  tim ferriss: as far as we know, maybe.  amelia boone: well, right. when my time finally comes, and i realize that there's a super cool world on the other side, i'm gonna be like, \"goddamn it.\"  tim ferriss: yeah. well, amelia thanks so much for taking the time.  amelia boone: thank you.  tim ferriss: and, where can people say hello, or find you on the interwebs, and so on?  amelia boone: on my grossly-in-need-of-an-update website, ameliabooneracing.com. but, i actually am most active on twitterthe handle is ameliaboone  tim ferriss: boone with an \"e\"?  amelia boone: what?  tim ferriss: boone with an \"e\" at the end? amelia boone, b-o-o-n-e.  amelia boone: correct. but, be forewarned, i tweet a fair amount about the seahawks, and professional wrestling. so, if you're not into that, you probably don't want to follow me. and then, i'm on instagram as well. it's arboone11 because ameliaboone was already taken by the time i joined that.  tim ferriss: arboone11.    amelia boone: correct. and, i'm on facebook. i don't have an athlete page because i don't really like that, or believe in that, but you can follow me. but, i don't really become friends with people i haven't met before in life because that weirds me out.  tim ferriss: so, twitter.  amelia boone: so, twitter and instagram are your best bets.  tim ferriss: twitter and instagram, cool. well, this has been a blast  amelia boone: yeah.  tim ferriss: everybody listening, we will link to the books, and so on - the manuka honey bandages - and whatnot. everything mentioned in the show notes. you can

ameliabooneracing.com", "yes", "mm-hmm", "and, can you describe the photo that takes up most of the real estate on that page", "well - so, the website needs a bit of updating", "i'm not a great website person", "so, if you know - if anybody wants to volunteer, be my guest", "but, it's a picture of me, i'm in the middle of barbed wire, and i'm crawling on my hands and knees", "and, i'm just, kind of, looking around, semi-perplexed", "and, to me that just, kind of, encapsulates everything that i do; i'm bleeding from my knees, my elbows, and it's - i'm just crawling through the mud, having a good time", "this is a microcosm of the face of obstacle course racing", "exactly", "exactly, it's not pretty", "and, we met through scott keneally", "mm-hmm", "who is putting together, it may be finished by the time people see this is available, rise of the sufferfests", "so, sufferfest, you mentioned the dirt,t he barbed wire", "maybe we can explain, to people who are unfamiliar, what obstacle course racing is, with the example of the world's toughest mudder", "yeah", "can you describe, what on earth that is", "well - so, that's kind of like the extreme of obstacle course racing", "right", "but, in general, i think people have been familiar with spartan races, with tough mudders", "you see people jumping over fire and crawling under barbed wire, and it's just - you're running along and you have a wall to climb", "and, your jumping through mud, and you're using everything that you have", "it's just a completely physical experience   so, i got involved back in 2011 when i ran a tough mudder with friends, and then signed up for - there was this race that was announced called world's toughest mudder, and they were like, \"you, for 24 hours, are gonna run as many laps of a course, a tough mudder course, as you can", "and, it's gonna be in december, in new jersey.\" and, so -   sounds balmy", " - balmy", "i was like, \"man, i can't think of anywhere i'd rather go than new jersey in december.\" and so, a bunch of us signed - i think 1,000 people signed up for this, and nobody had any idea what they were getting into", "we had all run a tough mudder, or run a spartan race, but nobody had ever really done it for 24 hours", "so, we went out on that day, and people were trying to figure out, \"how do you stay worm for 24 hours, when you're in and out of water, and it's december, and it's new jersey?\"    so, we decided that we would wear wet suits, or that wet suits would be the way to stay warm", "and, other people, former triathletes, \"oh, there's no way you can run for 24 hours in a wet suit, you'll die.\" your thermal regulation will be all off, or whatever", "but, we did", "and, halfway through - so, we all go out, and it's like   30 degrees outside in new jersey", "mm-hmm", "after the first lap, there were about 1,000 people that had started, i'd say maybe 850 people dropped out", "after the first lap", "just done", "first lap, done", "and, this was, what, like an hour - a few hours into it", "probably an hour and a half", "and, i remember going back in my tent, and just shivering uncontrollably", "i was being like, \"what am i doing", "what is going on here?\"  mm-hmm", "you would walk past the med tents, and there were just people in there, laying on cots", "they were using warm saline bags to put under people's armpits to keep them warm", "so, a few of us decided that we were going to keep going and, i think by the time the night descended on us, it was 2 a.m", "we were wading through water, and there was ice forming", "we were breaking holes in the ice, and i'm sitting there like, \"what am i doing", "what am i doing?\" but, at the same time, having so much fun", "and, out of 1,000 people that started that race, 12 finished, and i was one of two women", "so, that was the start of it all", "for some unknown reason, i remember when i finished that race 24 hours later, i was like, \"never again, never again.\" then, two weeks later, i was like, \"sign me up", "what's next", "sign me up.\"  the drive to do this type of thing - there's so many different approaches i could take to try to dissect this, but are your parents very surprised, not surprised at all, or somewhere in between", "i would say, somewhere in between because i've always been the high achiever", "i'm type a; i want to be at the top of my class, i want to be graduating summa cum laude and going to law school, and everything like that", "i read that one of your law school classmates said that you would find a way to be competitive, or to win, in anything, if it were folding laundry of otherwise", "oh, yeah", "in law school, the extent of my exercise was getting on the elliptical, like everybody else, and i would find a way to compete with the person on the elliptical next to me", "man, those were the days   so, i think the drive and determination, that doesn't phase my parents", "they're like, \"par for the course.\" but, in terms of how it manifested itself - because i've always been a creature of routine, and i don't like surprises, and i want to be able to plan everything and know everything", "with obstacle course racing it's so unknown when you go out there", "for the most part, when i first started, they wouldn't even show you - you wouldn't see a course map, so you wouldn't know what was out there", "so, i think at that part, they're kind of like, \"wow.\" or, when i would sign up for the death race, and they would be like, \"72 hours in the woods, and you don't know what you're going to be doing, but have at it.\" so, that was a very atypical personality for me", "where did you grow up", "i grew up in portland, oregon", "in portland", "and, what did your parents do growing up", "so, my dad was an insurance adjuster, and my mom was an environmental consultant", "where did the competitive edge come from", "it's funny, they have no idea, and i have - i think it's got to be innate, to be totally honest, because my parents were always like, \"you can get c's, that's fine,\" or, \"you can play this sport, or you don't have to play this sport", "as long as your happy", "just do what makes you happy.\"   sounds more portland", "yeah, right", "it was never, if you think of sage parents, i was the opposite of that", "so, they were always telling me to calm down and take a break, but instead i just -   that worked well", "yeah, right", "do you have siblings", "i do", "i have an older sister", "older sister", "yeah", "is she also competitively driven, like yourself", "no, we're pretty much, in terms of personalities, opposites", "polar opposites", "polar opposites", "she's extremely successful, but she came about it from a very - way more laid back and low key approach", "what did you want to be when you were a kid", "what did you want to be when you grew up", "i wanted to be a lawyer when i grew up", "oh, and you nailed it", "i nailed it", "i was one of those people that was like, \"if i set my mind to something, then i'm going to do it.\" so, i would - for lunch everyday, when i was home for the summer, my mom and i would watch perry mason, and i was like, \"man, perry mason, being an attorney, he gets the bad guy to confess every single episode", "that's got to be cool.\"  perry mason is great", "i remember perry mason", "so, then i went to law school, and realized that's not actually what happens, and - yeah", "so, you were a perry mason than a matlock person", "yes, yes", "i was a perry mason person", "so, you decide you want to be a lawyer", "did that change, did that waiver, or did that stick with you all the way up until the point that you became a lawyer", "i think it pretty much - i kind of thought of different things in college", "i really got - i really fell in love with anthropology and primates", "so, i really love studying monkeys", "and, i thought for a part of me, maybe i should go to madagascar and hang out with the lemurs, or i could go get a law degree", "so, i double majored in anthropology and political science, and then decided to take the safe route and go with the law degree", "mm-hmm", "and, that was u washington, or -", "washington university in st", "louis", "washington university", "yeah", "that's right", "what did you do athletically in high school, or college", "so, growing up i was kind of like a jack-of-all-trades athlete in that i played - i was always on a club team like asa softball, or club soccer, traveling basketball, so i played year round   and, i was always good", "i was on the competitive, the highest level teams", "i was never a super stand-out all-star in any one single sport", "so, i played year-round, and i would shuttle back and forth from practice to practice throughout middle school, and then high school", "but, i started paring that down, and i actually - as high school progressed, i got more and more into musical theatre, and show choir, and singing, and i kind of gave up sports and athleticsso, in college, actually, i sang in an a capella group, but i had no sports", "no sports in college", "no sports", "recreationally, were you a runner", "i would go out in run to stay in shape, but running in st", "louis kind of sucked", "so, it was either hot and muggy, or freezing cold", "so, yeah", "i didn't really do anything", "let's sort of - i'm gonna jump around a little bit, like memento", "yeah", "but, if we were to look at, say, the world's toughest mudder", "yeah", "what do your routines look like", "you said you're a creature of habit, as am i", "the hours before the competition, let's just say the day of, what are your routines", "so, i always get up super early before - well, i get up super early in general every morning, and i -   what's super early", "so, my alarm typically goes off right around 4 a.m", "that's why you didn't flinch when we were talking about jocko willink, the seal commander", "yeah", "i'm like, \"and, he wakes up at 4 a.m.\"  yeah", "zero response", "i'm like, \"uh-oh, another one", "here we are.\"  yeah, 4 a.m., and - so actually, on race days, it's almost like i sleep in a little bit, but -   when do the races start typically", "they generally will start - world's toughest mudder is a little bit different, that one starts at 2 p.m", "now, but just a regular obstacle course race would generally be 7:30 a.m", "is the starting time", "i got it", "so, that starts at 2 p.m", "so, let's use that example", "you wake up at 4 a.m-   oh, yeah", "then, i drive myself crazy for the next however many hours, twiddling my thumbs", "what other type of body prep, or mental prep, do you do", "yeah", "i generally use the distraction technique", "mm-hmm", "so, i try to not think about it, really", "because i can sit there and make myself miserable over and over, picturing the race, or whatever", "but, i find it helpful, actually - i actually do a lot of work in the mornings before races", "so, i'll catch up on emails, i'll do things from my attorney life", "and then, in terms of body prep, i do a lot of foam rolling, mobility, things like that", "the older i get, the more i realize that i can't just jump out of bed in the morning, and be spry as a chicken", "you're 32, is that right", "32", "32, yeah", "32", "i would imagine yous till have a couple of good years left in you, but -   yes", "sometimes it feels a lot worse though, let me tell you", "the mobility work that you do, what does that actually look like in detail", "yeah", "so, i generally carry an arsenal of every single - from a golf ball, a lacrosse ball, a softball, a foam roller", "so, i'm really focused on loosening up hips, loosening up hamstrings, and every single different, little torture device has - the golf ball is for the foot  mm-hmm", "the lacrosse ball works well on the gluts", "the softball is great for the hamstrings", "so, i'm just getting the muscles warmed up, and loosened, and prepped", "i do - i actually, from a lot of various nagging injuries that i've always had, i have little physical therapy routines that i always do too", "you know, like to get your gluts activated, and things like that", "what type of movements do you do for glut activation", "there's this fantastic exercise, called jane fonda's -   jane fonda's", "- that, if anybody's ever been in -   are these for, like, glut median, or are these -", "oh, yeah, yeah, yeah", "glut median,where you're sitting there, and you're like, \"man, i should really have leg warmers on right now.\"  so, you're talking about - is this the bent leg - sort of the reverse thigh master", "pretty much, yeah", "yeah", "it's the reverse thigh master", "on your side", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "and, variations, like doing fire hydrants, that too; a dog lifting it's legs", "these are all super sexy things that people - if you do them in a gym, people are like, \"oh, godthere's that girl.\"  well, i'll tell you: i think you get more attention doing fire hydrants than i do at least, unless i'm in a gym in the castro", "right", "which, it might be a similar experience", "and, do  you use any other modalities for rep", "do you use any stem, do you use anything like that pre-race, or is that set aside for other purposes", "pre-race, not so much", "no, that's more like recovery", "recovery i'll -  compression boots, and stem", "now, are compression boots the compression socks, or are these actual boots", "the boots that inflate, you know", "ah, right", "the air pressure chambers that supposedly flush out lactic acid", "mm-hmm", "and, that's post-race", "that would be post-race, yeah", "so - well, let's talk about post-race then", "so, in terms of facilitating   recovery; so, you finish the race", "yeah", "and, is it true that you have not slept for days on end after races, or is that an exaggeration", "no, it is true", "so, any long race that i've done - like world's toughest mudder is a 24 hour race", "i've done other races that are longer - 48 - that are 60 hours", "and, i feel like it's - i can't sleep afterwards", "and, you feel like you should be able to", "you're like, \"wow", "i was just up for three days straight, running around in the woods.\" but, my mind -  your body is so physically exhausted, but my mind is still on overdrive, so i just can't", "so for instance, this year, after world's toughest mudder, there was a group of us staying at a house; sat around, were drinking beers, watching a football game", "and, i was like, \"man, i should really be getting drunk right now.\" or, something like that because i've been drinking, i've been running around in a wet suit all night long", "i'm like, \"i don't feel anything.\" i don't feel any effects of the booze, or anything like that", "i was like, \"it just must be this adrenaline still pumping through me.\"  mm-hmm", "did other people have the same, or similar experience, or is that unique to you", "i think, no because everyone else just, kind of, passed out and went to bed", "okay", "so, i was like, \"hey, guys", "let's - hey, okay", "everyone's asleep right now, cool.\"  and, when you cross the finish line, as such, you're done", "what type of recovery starts", "what are the actions that you take in the hours following the race", "so, i think one of the most important things that people should do, that they don't, is you have to stay moving", "people wanna finish a race, and especially a long one, and just lay on a couch, or go to sleep", "that is the worst thing you can do because you're gonna wake up and not be able to move anything", "so, i generally try to stay walking, i try to stay active", "i will hop, again, on a foam roller, or something like that, and try - you don't wanna be too aggressive   afterwards", "you're not gonna hop on a softball and roll out your gluts because that's gonna hurt really bad", "but then, just try to stay active", "and, that is in the next day too; gentle movement, and things like that", "do you use - are you a proponent of ice, ice baths, or anything like that", "or, are you not", "if i can't - so look, i'm not a scientist", "all i know is what works for me", "people have different opinions", "if i can get into an ice bath, i will, but it needs to be immediately", "so, there have been races where there's been a lake right next to me, and i'm like,  \"if it's cold enough, then i'll just go jump in the lake.\" and, kind of use that as an ice bath", "but, if you're waiting four or five hours, i don't think it's gonna end up helping you in the end", "and, i want you to correct me if i'm wrong; 2012 world's toughest mudder", "mm-hmm", "how did you place", "i won for females, but i was second overall in 2012", "second place overall", "yeah", "how did that feel", "so, it was a really interesting race", "how many competitors", "this was -  again,t here were about 1,200 people, i believe", "that's generally every year", "so, there were about 1,200 people", "this one - they move it to november, so it was supposedly a tiny bit warmer, but actually it wasn't", "it was actually colder in 2012 than it was in 2011", "and, i guess he didn't realize - i knew i was winning for women, and at this point we were about 24 hours - or, getting close to the end, and i was about 80 sole odd miles in", "and, i was on the last lap", "they were like, \"okay, well you've won for women, but the guy that's winning is nine minutes ahead of you.\"     so, we're on this last lap, going - we'll end up with 90 miles", "and, there are all these people from tough mudder headquarters, and all these people that matter, just yelling at me, willing me to go on because all they want me to do is to win overall, you know", "and, you're so tired at that point, and so, kind of, delirious that, i guess, i didn't even realize the import of that situation; how massive that would've been", "because i was just like, \"leave me alone", "i hurt, i'm tired, i'm freezing.\"  \"i hear you.\"  i'm covered in ten millimeters of neoprene, i've just - and, i'm like, \"i get it", "i'm trying to move fast, but my body won't let me.\" but, yeah", "so, i ended up finishing about nine minutes behind the male, overall winner", "yeah", "so, it was pretty - it didn't really hit me until a day or two later, where i was like, \"oh, i was that closeokay.\"  so, did you not - did you feel pride about finishing second overall", "or, were you just - were you more disappointed that you didn't finish first overall", "no, no, no", "i completely felt pride, and it's actually - it's one of these things now that, when i race, it's almost - i kind of look at the standing - it's cool to win, as a female, to be like, \"oh, i'm the female winner.\" but, i more look of like - i have a consistent goal of trying to place top ten overall, you know", "mm-hmm", "i wanna be - i don't care about sex or gender", "i just wanna be - i wanna compete the best overall, so", "and, the next female finisher, what place was she", "actually, in 2012, she was third", "oh, no kidding", "yeah", "so, the top -   wow, good for her", "what was her name", "deanna blegg", "she's amazing", "she's absolutely amazing", "46 years old, from australia", "46", "yeah", "just crushes it out there", "what a beast", "yeah", "okay, all my excuses just went out the window", "i know, right", "right", "and, she's the like the nicest woman in the entire world, too  how does her strategy, for training or in the race itself, differ from a younger competitor", "i would say - i think probably, as you get older, you realize you don't go out as fast", "it's kind of like, as you age, you're never gonna out-sprint a 20-something-year-old", "but, you tend to have more mental strength, more mental grit, the older you get, just because you're like, \"whatever, this isn't a big deal.\" you're more mature, and you can deal with pain and suffering", "so, i think that it's just more of a slow and steady; just keep going, one foot in front of the other", "mm-hmm", "but, to that extent, that's how i operate too", "i'm notoriously slow out of the gate", "in the beginning of races i'm always struggling to catch up with everyone, which is why i like longer races", "so, it's just picking them off one by one", "when you are - actually, before that", "so, suffering", "mm-hmm", "let's talk about suffering", "yeah", "i was just reading a letter of seneca's", "mm-hmm", "who is that guy", "yeah", "that's the bust on the kitchen counter over there", "related to - i think it's, \"on fasting and celebration,\" something related to thatbut, it talks about exposing yourself to suffering", "right", "along the lines of, the more you sweat during peace, the less you bleed during war", "right", "and so, i practice fasting for many reasons; among those, being - practicing hardship, right", "okay", "so, i can endure it in other areas of my life", "do you dot hat in other places in your life", "where you deliberately expose yourself to different types of pain or suffering as a practice", "or, is it limited to the sufferfests", "with the amount that i race there's plenty of suffering involved in that", "it's sufficient", "i guess, i can't do the fasting thing", "i'm not good with that", "well, you're burning a lot more calories than i am", "if i don't eat every few hours, it's trouble for anyone around mebut, i always try to train in less than ideal conditions, if i can, because i think that adds a lot to - it's super easy to go out for a run when it's 70 degrees", "mm-hmm", "and sunny", "but, when i was living in chicago, which i did for the past six years, if there was a wind storm, or a thunderstorm, i was like, \"let me out.\"  perfect time to run", "perfect time to go run", "there was one time that i - they had shut   down lakefront path because the waves were coming over, and i was like, \"fuck it, i'm gonna run it anyway.\" and, apparently police don't like that", "so, as i'm like -   i'd love to see that", "please tell me the police tried to catch you on foot", "did they", "no", "well, it was a bicycle cop", "oh, alright", "who - i was actually surprised that he was out in the weather as well", "but, yeah", "and he was  like, \"you can't", "this is shut down\" i'm like, \"i'm just training", "no big deal", "no big deal.\"  yeah", "did that sway his position", "no, no", "no, not at all", "so, training in less than ideal conditions", "mm-hmm", "when you look back at the races that you've run, the obstacle course races -   mm-hmm", "what has been the most challenging obstacle for you, and what has been the most dangerous", "i would say, in terms of challenging, i always - so, there's always - i'm notoriously awful at throwing a spear", "and, it's well known in communities that i can't throw a spear to save my life", "and so, in spartan races there's always a spear throw, and it's actually cost me tons of different races", "and, it's funny because it's one of those things that, if you practice you would probably be pretty good at it", "this is why i'm puzzled right now", "okay, keep going", "why", "about throwing a spear", "no, like summa cum laude, ace lawyer, world champion racer - okay", "so, continue, not to interrupt", "well, i can't throw a spear, no", "no, but it seems like the kind of thing you would sit down, and study, and master", "you would think so", "i actually think that playing softball my entire life kind of screwed me because i would try to throw it like you throw a softball", "which you can't do", "oh, yeah", "the underhand spear", "no, no, no, just -   i'm just messing with you", "wah, wah, wah", "she throws like a girl", "no, no, no", "but, come on, the pitching does - it's completely different, right", "yeah", "yes, it is completely different", "i'm referring to the pitching, folks", "don't get all riled up", "right", "so,t hat's always been - it's always been a challenge for meand, i finally figured it out, but it's one of those things that - it's such a silly thing to struggle with, i think", "but, i guess that also could be the most dangerous because if you miss a spear throw, and somebody's around -   yeah", "no, i'm joking", "but, there are some", "in terms of danger for obstacles, there are times where i'm sitting there, being like, \"why hasn't somebody died in these?\" oh, i take that back", "that's really bad because somebody did die", "but -   yeah", "dangerous spark", "yeah", "when you're racing for 24 hours, especially for really long, and you're climbing super tall things in the middle of the night, i'm always sitting there, being like, \"man, one misstep, and i'm falling backwards.\"  yeah", "and, i've taken some big diggers off of walls, just because you're   so tired, you just end up falling off", "big diggers meaning falls", "big, awful falls, you know", "so, how - then these are walls that you're climbing over, similar to a military obstacle course", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "how tall are they", "they vary, some are 8 feet, some are 10 feet, some are 12 feetsome have ropes to help you up them, others there's big laddersdo you know military tack ladders", "mm-hmm", "that climbing out of water", "so, there was one time, i think it was in 2012 world's toughest mudder, you climbed one of those out of a lake, and it was 20 feet up", "but, it was in the middle of the night, and it was frozen", "and so, it's like iced over, and you're like, \"i'm gonna die, i'm gonna die.\" but, yeah", "so, there's all these little dangers", "and, people talk about the electricity involved in tough mudders", "mm-hmm", "which is a very disconcerting - because i've been hit so hard sometimes that i've blacked out", "from the electricity", "yeah, and just -   can you describe this obstacle to folks", "yeah, so", "well, there's a couple variations of it, but basically there's these wires hanging", "the worst variation was called electric eeland, you crawl through water that's about two, three inches deep, and there's wires hanging down over your head", "and so, you're army-crawling through it, and your head is hitting these wires, and they will occasionally will shock you, zap you", "is it 10,000 volts", "i don't - there's a difference between voltage and wattage, and i don't really understand what it is", "mm-hmm", "but, one will kill you, and one won't", "so, this is supposedly the stuff that won't kill you", "but, if you get hit in just the right way, and you're in water - i got hit so hard, and my face smacked down through the water, and i hit my head", "and then, i blacked out, i started crawling the wrong way", "and, that was one of those things that, once you do that - something like that happens to you, you just have this insane fear of it", "mm-hmm", "and so, it's the worst for me now, trying to prep myself to do that", "so, you just have the trepidation", "yeah", "beforehand", "yeah", "the people who get injured, or even the fatalities, what are the most common causes", "honestly, i think the vast majority of injuries are things like rolled ankles, broken ankles, you've fallen down things", "so, what you would expect", "what you would expect", "i don't think they've never - the one unfortunate death that we know of, that have occurred, or deaths that have occurred, have been heat stroke, dehydration, the things you find in -   same that you would find in ultra marathon and marathon running", "exactly, exactly", "it's not - surprisingly, for something that is fraught with electricity, and spears, and climbing up super tall things, and crawling through barbed wire, nobody has lost an eye, i don't think, from barbed wire", "one of my buddies got zapped in the eye with one of those electric lines", "he was not super happy about that", "i bet", "the worst extent of my injuries are, really, my body is just covered in barbed wire scars and scratches", "you can probably - i can show you them, but i look like i was attacked by a tiger", "yeah", "yeah, i was wondering what kind of cat you had", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "it's everywhere; and rope burns", "i'm never gonna be a leg model because it's just -   fifty shades of tough mudder, yeah", "god, it's covered", "the surgery", "i wanna talk about your knee surgery", "yeah", "why did you get knee surgery", "let's start with that, what was the reason for the knee surgery", "so, i, last summer, heading into world championship season, ended up tearing my meniscus, and -   that was in training, in running, or -", "it was in training", "i was running in chicago, and there were pot holes everywhere", "and, it was one of those freak things,w here you step in something, and you're like, \"ah", "ah my leg!\" and then, i'm running it off, and i'm like, \"oh, wait", "this actually isn't okay.\" so, i went and i had an mri, and i thought i was okay, but my leg kept locking and i had to physically unlock it, and with certain meniscus tears that happens", "so, they had to go int heir and shave down the meniscus", "and then, there were some tibial plateau fracture, or whatever fancy word", "so, i just had to stay off of it for a bit, yeah", "when did you - so, that happened; how much later did you compete", "so, i raced again eight weeks post-surgery", "and, i remember asking my surgeon -   this was the world's toughest mudder", "correct", "2014", "correct", "but, you won", "i did", "so, i remember asking my surgeon, \"so, how long until i'm back running?\" he was like, \"maybe four weeks.\" and, i go, \"so, could i feasibly run a race eight weeks later?\" he's like, \"yeah.\" and, i was like, \"how long of a race?\" because he was thinking like i was gonna run a 5k", "do a 5k", "i was like, \"well, it's 24 hours.\" so, i never got his blessing for it, but i did it anyway", "what did you do between the - what steps did you take to rehab it", "what were the most important things that you did", "i think, most importantly for me was getting into - i got into physical therapy the next day", "i had the best physical therapist in chicago, and she was fantastic", "she had worked with me through other injuries, and things like that", "so, we were pretty aggressive in rehab-ing it", "and then, i just did whatever else i could to work around it, and stay in shape", "i think when people get injured, they forget that there's so much that they still can do", "mm-hmm", "so, i had a gym that had a skierg", "which, if you've ever seen, is like a rower turned upside down, and you pull it like you're cross-country skiing", "so, for two weeks that was the only thing i could really do to keep my heart rate up", "so, a handbike, skierg -   handbike, skierg, i could row with one leg, but then that kind of throws - then my other leg, which is getting massive", "but, i would do - i rowed a 10k, or i skierg'd a 10k, which is the worst kind of torture you can do to yourself", "and, just finding other ways to work around it", "what other rehab modalities did you find most helpful, personally", "i did a lot of stem, for - to get - because i think when you go and   you do -   electrical stimulation", "electrical stimulation, yeah", "so, when you go in and you cut open your knee, it shuts down your quad", "so, the main thing is getting your quad to, then, come back and function again", "and so, stem is really helpful in retraining that, to get it to fire", "mm-hmm", "that was helpful", "and, really i'm a huge fan of art, graston, all those", "so, for people that are not familiar, art is active release technique, a type of myofascial release", "yes, correct", "which is super - depending on how you have it done, can be super unpleasant if you're having your psoas worked on", "oh my god", "i love that pain though", "i think it's the coolest thing", "you like having some therapist with their ridge hand knuckle deep into your psoas", "i had, just as a side note - alright, i'm gonna give a shout-out to this guy, jesse birdick, who's a power lifter, who trains with a  friend of mine named mark bell", "i mean, they do a lot of training separately", "but, i think he pulls - and, jesse i apologize if i get this wrong, but he can dead lift more than 700 lbs", "yeah", "he's a big unit", "yeah", "and, we were getting ready to do - he also does manual therapieswe were getting ready to do an art session, and so he puts me on a table, drapes one leg off -   yeah", "- and he goes, \"the safe word is brisket.\" and then, just proceeds to annihilate my hips", "so the basic idea folks, for those of you who   don't know, art - and, please correct me if i get this wrong", "yeah", "but, if you have adhesions, let's just say with scar tissue between adjacent tissues, you apply pressure, manual pressure - a therapist applies pressure between those tissues, and then has you perform motions, like an overhead, reaching movement for the lats, to break apart those adhesions", "right", "graston, which is like having really thick butter knives scraped all over you, is that it", "right", "i read that you use something, and i'm embarrassed because i actually don't know what this is; dry-needling", "oh, yeah", "what is that", "okay, so it's -   sounds terrible", "so, it's apparently illegal in california, which is why you probably don't know what it is", "it's like acupuncture on crack", "mm-hmm", "so, acupuncturists actually, rightfully probably, hate it because i think that they think it's kind of a bastardization of what they do", "mm-hmm", "but, when you go and you get acupuncture, and the goal is not to feel the needle, dry-needling you actually are sticking the needle in the muscle valley to try to get it to twitch", "and, the twitch is the release", "so, it's like - and, you don't leave the needles in there", "so, you're basically poking at a muscle to try and get -   just a sowing machine", "yeah", "and, the worst ever, don't ever let anybody dry-needle your calf or your gastrocnemius because if you get in underneath right at the hamstring insertion you will feel like you got shot in the back of your legs", "but, it can also be kind of addictive because you have somebody poking around in your glutus medius, and you feel this twitch, and it's almost like this release of the muscle, and -   what does it do for you", "it's supposed to - for super tight muscles the idea is to get it to release", "release spasms", "yeah", "huh", "so, yeah", "i had the - i had this nutty experience", "and, if people wanna see photos of me in excruciating pain, getting art done by charles poliquin, you can see that in the 4-hour body; it's kind of hilarious", "but, i had a separate experience with something called - let's see, i guess it would be called - i wanna say neuropuncture, but i might be getting that wrong", "this was done with dr", "lee wolfer many years ago, with shallow injections of prolo solution", "oh, yeah", "and, what happened though, and we improvised at this point, is she was working on my infraspinatus", "this sis rotator cuff muscle that always get sore for me", "yeah", "and, i had reconstructive shoulder surgery, and i probably sit with chest collapsed, like gollum, when i'm typing also", "right", "which is no good", "but, she was working on my infraspinatus, and she was doing the sowing machine approach, with these shallow injections", "and, we both hear, \"kkch, kkch.\" and, it sounded like someone was scraping ice off of a windshield", "oh my god", "and, it turned out that i had these - just this huge clump of calcium deposits at the back of both shoulders", "so, we ended up just - well, we", "it's a royal we", "she ended up using the needle, basically, as a scraper to kind of break down these calcium deposits", "and, what was fascinating is i had no shoulder pain for months afterward", "huh", "after chiseling these out", "it wasn't the most pleasant thing in the world", "right", "so, the dry-needling", "now that you're here in california no more - sad times", "no more glutus medius pokes", "i'm gonna have to go back to my -   black market dry-needling", "well, sometimes i'll get acupuncture done, and i'll be like, \"can you guys...\" and, accidentally a muscle will trigger and releaseand i'm like, \"oh, that's fantastic, do it again.\" but, i'm one of those people", "i'll try anything once, in terms of recovery", "yeah", "i'll just throw the - especially because for most professional athletes, what they do, their job is to be a professional athlete, and then to rehab and recover, and spend all that time", "i'm training early in the mornings, i go and sit at a desk for ten hours a day, and then i try to train again in the evenings", "it's not an ideal - i'm not doing my body any favors with what i'm putting it through", "what does your nutrition look like", "were you serious earlier when i asked you about breakfast", "yes", "what was your answer", "we were doing a sound check and i asked her what she had for breakfast", "what was your answer", "pop-tarts", "pop-tarts", "no, that's actually - so, pop-tarts have become this running joke in the obstacle racing community with me because when i won the spartan race world championships in 2013 i was so far ahead", "i was 20 or 30 minutes ahead of the next woman", "and, the race director yells out at me, \"milly, what did you have for breakfast this morning?\" and, i actually did, randomly, that day because they're a really good source of easy digestible carbs", "milly", "is that what you said", "or, did he say your full name", "sorry, i heard milly", "sorry, he said amelia", "sometimes, i can't say my own name", "and, it kind of became this thing", "i would just - pre-race ritual - that it would be a good luck thing to have a pop-tart", "yeah, sure", "because i'm really into superstition", "and, it's kind of grown from there", "and, now i see - i was at a race the other weekend, and everyone around me was eating pop-tarts", "and, i'm like, \"what have i started", "what?\" and then, everyone posts these pictures on instagram of them eating pop-tarts, and they tag me in it", "and, i'm like, \"oh my god, i've created a monster.\"  well, this actually could be an incredible opportunity for you to do whatever you want because i remember watching pumping iron, and arnold schwarzenegger's talking about the guys who would come up to him and ask him for advice, and he'd give them the wrong advice", "and, he would tell them to go into the shower at the gym and scream while they're posing", "so, you could actually -   right", "you could pull and incredible april fool's joke, but announce it a year later", "right", "after everyone has already embraced it", "i know", "so, now i'm like, \"okay", "well, what's the next thing?\"  what other superstitions do you have", "not limited to racing necessarily, just curious", "yeah", "i'm one of those people that - so, it's the same - i will wear the same sports bra", "so, we race, pretty much, in a sports bra and compression shorts because you want as little clothing, to hold down the mud, as possible", "so, i'll wear the same - if i did well in a race, i'll wear the same outfit for the next race", "mm-hmm", "and, especially the same headband", "and then, if i don't do well, then that one gets discarded", "so, it's that kind of, typical sports stuff  mm-hmm", "i actually have - this is kind of embarrassing, but - a small, little, stuffed dog that travels with me to all races because i'm typically by myself in really cheap, sketchy hotels", "mm-hmm", "because these races are in the middle of nowhere", "so, it's my little guard dog", "how big is the stuffed dog", "oh, it fits in the palm of your hand", "where did you get that", "it was given to me as a gift", "as a protection", "as a protection", "as a guardian", "as a guard dog", "so, yeah", "it's just silly stuff like that", "outside of pop-tarts -   yeah, what do i actually eat", "yeah", "what is your - let's just say you're four weeks out from a race", "yeah", "what does a day of food look like for you", "that's hard to say", "honestly, it's one of those things i've struggled with, that i've tried everything", "i tried to do paleo, i tried to be like, \"maybe i can become a fat-adapted athlete,\" because for longer races i didn't want to have to rely on gels and [inaudible] -   gels, right", "- and stuff like that because after awhile it can be too much on your stomach", "but, i just never - i'm never gonna be the paradigm of good eating, of - and, i couldn't stick with the whole trying to - i couldn't go far enough into the fat adaptation", "i was just miserable", "i like ice cream way too much", "somewhat counter indicated for ketosis and fat adaption", "exactly, exactly", "much too much sugar [inaudible]", "at a certain point, i think i realized that i'm performing well, i'm winning races, so why change", "if it gets to the point where i'm not doing well -   performing", "then i'll take another look at my diet and switch it", "mm-hmm", "but, at this point, it's - i run so much, i put in so much time that i'm like, \"whatever", "i enjoy food and i'll eat whatever.\"  what do you consume during a 24 hour race", "what is your - and, this is actually a question from a fan", "yeah", "which was, \"how does your gear that you bring with you differ in an obstacle course race versus an ultra marathon,\" for instance", "yeah", "aside from the wet suit", "yeah", "so, i think it really depends", "if you're running, as i've learned from dabbling in ultra marathons, is that my body doesn't - especially if you're running hard, my body isn't gonna handle solid food as well as  - the stomach will - stomach acid and stuff like that", "so, there's a lot of liquid", "tailwind is good, something that a lot of people use, that's easy on your stomach", "tailwind", "that's a good name  yeah, yeah, yeah", "but, i also just find simple - i actually really love chewing on things", "clif makes these blocks", "so, i do", "i take in simple sugars that fuel me through that", "i will -   how often do you eat during a 24 hour race", "i try and fuel every 30 minutes to an hour; get something in, but in little bits", "mm-hmm", "and then, i'm telling you, sometimes the best things during a long race are - i had a krispy kreme doughnut during world's toughest mudder this past year, and it was the most phenomenal thing i'd ever had", "salty things; you wanna make sure that your electrolytes are keeping - especially if you're running in a wet suit because you're losing -   you must be losing so much - such an incredible amount of fluids", "yeah", "so, pickle juice, mustard, things like that", "but, do you carry that with you, or are there stations where you can get that", "there are stations, there are -   i'm just imagining a camel back, half full with pickle juice", "well, i actually do, i carry mustard packets with me, small packets", "mustard packets", "because vinegar, if you ever have issues with cramping, they say   that the vinegar, the salt, stuff like that can - pickle juice is well known to stop cramps in their tracks", "huh", "pickle juice, i suppose that makes sense", "yeah, yeah", "pickle juice is harder to carry with you", "yeah", "unless you have a little vial, or something like that", "but, yeah", "so, i think that for the longer the race gets, you obviously need more gear", "especially depending on the cold, and the weather, and what your conditions are", "and so, sometimes it's pretty massive", "you mentioning electrolytes - it's fascinating when you look at the record of health issues in endurance races, most people assume a lot of it would be related to dehydration, but often times it's the complete opposite", "yeah", "where a lot of people, many people, consume too much water", "right", "and, they get - i guess it's -   hyponatremia, yeah", "hyponatremia, where you dilute sodium to the extent that in some cases, your heart stops functioning", "yeah", "and, the - i recall i was doing this kettle bell certification years ago, and it was just thousands and thousands of swings and whatnot, outside in minnesota", "and, people were getting horrible cramps, and they were like, \"oh, we're not drinking enough water, we need to drink more water.\"  yeah", "i'm like, \"no, that's not the issue", "you need some potassium tablets.\"  mm-hmm", "and, it's - but, god", "that could just be the worst", "yeah", "do people - i would imagine there must be a fair number of competitors who just have to drop out because they get quad or hamstring cramps", "or is that -", "yeah, cramps can be super debilitating, and i think - and, especially in really hot races, and also in really cold races, in the extremes", "so, it happens", "it's the reason why the longer the race is, the more unknown things that do into it", "it can be - it's always kind of a crap shoot", "you're like, \"come on body, please cooperate with me this one time.\" but, sometimes you can't predict it, so", "what supplements do you use on a daily basis", "caffeine", "no, i like coffee", "so, i am actually, really - have really bought the hype and the science behind beets", "beets, yeah", "so, i work with a company called beet-a-leet which is powdered beet, concentrated beet", "mm-hmm", "and so, it's really that - and, if you - i remember the first time i ever had beet juice, which just tastes like death, like dirt", "some people like bee juice, but i can't handle it", "but, you feel this weird head rush, almost", "mm-hmm", "and so, i was like, \"oh, there might be something to this shit.\" so, it's - so, i am really - it's something that i actually drink every - before work outs, and stuff like that", "and, it delivers the nitric oxide to help with breathing, and everything like that", "so, i think for endurance athletes, you don't need - i don't need the massive dose of caffeine before i go out and run because who wants to be jittery while running for several hours", "you need more of the help with the breathing, and with keeping the  heart rate low, and stuff like that", "and then, i also take - i try to stay away from anti-inflammatories,   like advil, and stuff like that, just because it's hard on the bodybut, i'm a big believer in turmeric", "yeah", "and, other things like that", "then anything to try and help with bones and joints", "so, do you just take glucosamine, or msm, or what type of stuff", "yeah, but try to get in natural; bone broth, gelatin, things like that", "mm-hmm", "but, bone broth is an expensive habit, until i bite the bullet and make my own", "but, then i have to handle chicken feet, and i'm not really into that, so", "you're in a good place for the bone broth, in the bay area", "i know", "what is it, three stone hearth, i think, in berkeley", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "and, further down the peninsula you got some really good sources as well", "right", "fortunately", "yeah", "hippies love bone broth", "oh, god", "it's the new thing, so yeah", "and, for anybody in new york, i'll just give a shout-out to a new - i guess it's kind of a side gig, started by a chef friend of mine, marco canora, who is in the 4-hour chef; brodo", "they serve hot bone broth in the winters, in new york city", "brodo, it's amazing", "that's sick", "and, you can get turmeric or cumin; you get different flavors", "oh, yeah", "yeah, you put things actually -   yeah", "you can pay for the add-ons", "what does your pre-hab routine look like", "so, the exercises", "what exercises do you do to prevent injuries", "yeah", "so, the main injuries that i've kind of dealt with have always been revolving around hips and gluts; like most runners, gluts that don't fire", "mm-hmm", "so, i -   the irony", "yeah,yeah, yeah", "exactly", "so, jane fonda's are the gold standardbut, it's a lot of stability work", "so, i try to do a lot of single leg stuff", "what type of single leg stuff", "so, single leg squats", "you see cross fitters do pistols all the way, ass to ground", "you don't need to do that kind of stuff", "you just do small, little, mini single leg squats", "mm-hmm", "i try and do - whenever i'm standing around, i'm trying to just stand on one leg, and balancing, and things like that", "i do a lot of band -  the physio-band walks", "so, monster walks", "yeah, or the x walks", "yeah, the x walks, that kind of stuff", "and then, a lot of work - especially as a trail runner, you really wanna work you - what is it, your transverse abdominus", "yeah", "the really deep, core muscles", "corset muscle", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "so, a lot of exercises that will engage that, like bird dogs, and things like that", "they're super not fun, and little tiny movements, but i think most people would rather go squat 200 lbsand ignore those, and that's not gonna help you", "so, you're working on glutus medius; you're doing isolateral, or single leg movements; do you do step-ups, any work on boxes", "i do", "i do two, i think, and lunges", "things like that", "anything that's requiring you to - that's requiring that unilateral movement, yeah", "and, how much time would you say yo spend on those types of pre-hab movements on a weekly basis", "it's probably about 12 to 20 minutes a day", "okay", "15 to 20 a day", "and, do you so that pre-workout?\" is it a separate workout, or after", "generally i'll do a few activation ones, like fire hydrants, beforeand then, it's generally afterwards that i'll devote 15, 20 minutes to those small, little, strengthening baby exercises", "and, how many miles, on average, do you run per week", "it's actually changed a lot", "i used to - a few years ago, i actually didn't really put in that much mileage", "i was like, \"running too much is not good for you,\" or whatever", "i've switched my training to be more running intensive because i realized that if you're gonna run for 24 hours, you  probably should run", "be good at running", "exactly because i always used to joke, i'm like, \"i'm not a runner,\" but then i realized that i actually love running on trails, and i love long, long runs", "now, i'm probably putting in 60, 70 miles a weekwhich actually is not that much for -   mm-hmm", "you see a lot of runners who put in 100 mile weeks, but -  60, 70 miles a week", "yeah", "and, how much time do you spend doing other types of training, like weight training, or otherwise", "yeah", "i do - i generally will cross fit three to four days a week", "mm-hmm", "or, some kind of bastardized version of my own, if i'm not actually gonna make it to a cross fit gym", "it's also because i pick and choose what i like to do from that", "right", "so, i guess it would be, probably, five to six other hours of strength training, interval training, things like that", "what is your morning routine, or routines, look like; first 60 minutes of your day", "first 60 minutes", "so, you wake up, punch the roosters, make them crow, 4 a.m-   yeah", "what happens - what does your day look like between, say, 4 a.mand 5:30 a.m.", "yeah", "i wish i could give you an answer that's like, \"i go out and i do sun salutations, or breathing exercises.\" well, the sun's not even out at that hour", "yeah", "but, it's nothing really that interesting", "i wake up, i'll - generally, at that point, i'll typically answer some work emails that, since i got to bed pretty early -   what times do you go to bed", "probably - i try to get in bed by 9 p.m.", "so, sometimes i'll have work emails that will come in later than that, so i'll answer thoseand then, i'm just gathering everything up and heading out to - if i'm going to the gym that day, or if i'm hitting up the trails that dayso - because i'll typically train in the morning, and then i'll get ready and go straight into work", "what time do you get to work", "about 7:30 a.m", "or so", "and so -   mm-hmm", "now, have you eaten breakfast at this point, or no", "i will eat - so, generally - so, i'll wake up in the morning -   pop-tarts, right", "no, just race days, and this morning because it was the only thing in the trunk of my car as i was driving up here", "i had ten pop-tarts in the trunk of my car", "but, i'll generally wake up, and i actually, typically, eat a few spoonfuls of nut butter to fuel before i go out", "for if i'm gonna go run 10, 15 miles, it's a good source of fuel to keep me going", "so, you'll just have a few tablespoons of almond butter, or something like that", "pretty much", "and, i found out that it sits well", "and then, i'll eat breakfast after i train, and then get to the office, things like that", "so, what does a non-pop-tart breakfast look like", "oh, generally, i'm a big fan of omelets, and eggs, and things like that in the morning", "mainly because i really like ketchup, and i always put ketchup on eggs", "it's just a vehicle for the ketchup", "pretty much", "and so, you sense a sugar theme going on here", "let's -   don't take diet advice from amelia", "i want to just take a few of these fan questions -   yeah", "and, we've hit on a number of them already, but -   i didn't know i had fans, but -     yes you did", "unless they're all coming from scott", "you have a lot of fans, among my fans", "this is a question that i would be interested to hear the answer to as well", "this is from cindy polluein, i'm probably massacring that; what is your self talk during training, and during the challenges, sound like", "the moment when you want to quit", "now, just to head this off with the pass, the answer may be that you don't feel like you want to quit", "yeah", "but, during extremely hard races, or challenging times, what does your self talk look like", "yeah", "because i found many athletes, maybe not you, have consistent routines in terms of their self talk", "so, what's interesting, especially with long races, is that you're always going to hit a low part, and there's always going to be a part where you want to quit", "you know, 24 hours - and, for me it generally comes early", "it's like four hours in, and i'm like, \"god, i got to do this for 20 more hours.\"  another 20 hours", "the sun's setting, and it's getting cold", "the wind's picking up, there's a massive sandstorm, whatever", "for me, i think i generally - it's hard because people ask me about self talk, and i generally just shut my brain off", "and, i feel that that's what keeps - i don't really think about anything, but i think when -   has that always been the case", "i think so, i think that -   and, do you just will that into being", "i think i just go", "well, i use different coping techniques", "i sing to myself a lot when i'm out there", "please tell me you sing out loud", "no", "sometimes, yes", "really", "yeah", "if i have enough breath", "yeah, yeah", "so, yeah", "there will be a certain song for every race, that will just replay through my head", "so, 2012 world's toughest mudder was macklemore's \"thrift shop\"", "it was right before it hit big", "no, right before it busted out, and i swear to god, i sang that song over and over again, and i can't listen to it the same way anymore", "what other songs - so, that was like you mantra, was macklemore", "yeah", "that was like you meditative mantra", "pretty much, for 24 hours", "for 24 hours, that's dedication", "what other songs have you used", "oh, god", "they range all of the place", "sometimes, it's just - i'll sing - so, my favorite hymn ever is - i was raised catholic, or whatever, and i love, i've always loved church music", "so, there's a christmas song, \"lo, how a rose e'er blooming,\" it's an old hymn", "mm-hmm", "so, not at all what you would think would be running through my head, running a race", "but, sometimes it does", "but then, this other race it was kanye", "it was kanye's \"monster\", the song was called \"monster.\"  do other racers do that as well, that you're aware of", "or, do - do any other top racers have coping approaches that you think are interesting", "you know, i think that a lot of people have that self talk", "i've always tried to - and i think this is pretty common", "a lot of us will try to break up the race into small segments because if you look at   the whole picture, it will get overwhelming", "if you're like, \"i have 100 miles to run,\" you think, \"crap.\" but, if you're like, \"no i only have three miles,\" or, \"i'm just gonna focus on getting through these next ten minutes.\" and so, i've always found that a lot of people who do long endurance events will break it up into small manageable chunks, and just focus on the next few minutes ahead of them", "mm-hmm", "and, i think that works pretty well", "do you - i mean, it sounds like you probably have some form of meditation when you run, and i think in terms of just mindfulness, i'm sure it's a very present state of mind to start with", "but, do you have a separate meditative practice of any type", "i don't", "i've tried", "i went to this retreat thing, that was fantastic, and i tried to do this meditation session, and i just - 20 minutes in, i was like, \"i gotta move, and do something, and get out of here.\" so, for me it's almost like the meditation is like working really hard", "like sprinting, or running, or lifting heavy weights", "that's like my yoga practice, you know", "mm-hmm", "now, i don't know what this refers to, but since will hicks is asking: are you going to do the 24 hour battle frog in march", "does that mean anything to you", "it does, yes", "okay", "it's a race", "it's another 24 hour obstacle race", "you know, maybe", "i don't know", "my schedule next year is kind of up in the air", "i really want to venture, and challenge myself in new ways", "and so, i think i'm going to be doing a lot more pure trail races too", "mm-hmm", "which i haven't really had a chance - especially being out here in california, it's much better", "i love climbing, running up mountains, stuff like that", "so, we'll see", "mm-hmm", "why did you decide to move to california", "a variety of reasons", "i think the main one was, i'm from the west   coast, and i wanted to get back here", "and then, it was time for a transition in a career for me", "i had been at a law firm for six years, and it was great, and they were fantastic", "but, i kind of wanted to try a new - going in-house, and working for a company there   and then - actually, i'll be honest, it's totally the training", "and, having mountains and hills around me", "it was really hard - i am the happiest when i am out on a mountain, running around somewhere, and i couldn't do that in chicago, so", "mm-hmm", "are you able to disclose the company that you're working for", "yes, so - it's this tiny little company, you may have heard of it, maybe not, i don't know", "i work for apple, yeah", "it's a good company", "i have a lot of friends at the mothership", "just wanted to make sure they would allow you to at least admit that you work there", "i mean, it's on my linkedin and facebook profile, so it's not -   okay, so then it's public", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "this is a very racing specific question", "stephen mckee: how do you keep your body limber, after ice or water immersion, during a race", "keep moving", "just keep moving", "yeah", "otherwise, when you slow down that's when your body temperature goes downand then, you're gonna get hypothermic", "mm-hmm", "so, let's go to the third act", "okay", "which is rapid fire question", "they don't have to be rapid fire answers", "but, the word successful", "yes", "when you hear the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind, and why", "god, that's so hard because i - this is gonna be your typical lawyer answer, where i'm like, \"because successful can have so many different definitions.\"  no, no", "that's fair though, but just, sort of, reflexively", "so, this is gonna be kind of a strange answer, probably", "but, i always find people who have transitioned their careers throughout their - who've had - i guess, who've been flexible in their careers, and who have transitioned - that answer is not coming out rightokay, here we go", "i'm gonna use an example", "i do that all the time, don't worry", "i was trying to record a 20 second intro for this little audio book yesterday", "yeah", "and, it probably took me 47 takes", "right, because you're all -   so, the example", "yeah, so", "i'm going to give you an example of a person who i find successful, and then i'll explain why", "perfect", "triple h", "triple h", "so, i am a huge wrestling fan, huge professional wrestling fanand, the reason why i'm gonna use it - and i could use a number of people as this example", "but, the reason i'm gonna use this is because i find people who have had one - so, he had a very successful wrestling career, but then transitioned to the business aspect of it", "you find so many people in it", "this is interesting, being - i guess you could technically call me, kind of, a  professional athlete", "you see a lot of people, who i find, are very short-sighted in that", "in that they're like, \"well, i'm racing now,\" but they don't think about what happens when they can no longer do that", "so, people who have been able to have a very successful athletic career, and then transition to the business side of things, or to think far ahead; those are the people i look to, that i'm like, \"they have everything.\" they have the athletic side of it, but then they also have the business acumen, and are smart enough to know that their body isn't going to always be there for them", "last forever", "yeah", "oscar de la hoya is a good example too, with golden boy productions", "mm-hmm", "right", "very savvy", "if we want to keep going with professional wrestling; the rock", "he transitioned to be an actor, you know", "yeah, he's done alright", "so -   triple h is a great example though", "so, paul levesque", "yeah", "really smart guy", "yeah", "i had him on the podcast", "i listened to it", "oh, it just blew my mind", "yeah", "really, really, really savvy guy", "right, right", "okay, so triple h", "i agree", "i also view him - he works out at, i think, midnight every day, with joe defranco, after his entire -   right", "he has very -  you guys have -  okay, so we're the opposite", "and, he's going to bed", "right, you have the opposite schedules", "but, he's also a big fan of routine, which i know and i've heard him talk about, too", "and, that's how i get by", "i don't care where i am in life; if i'm traveling, if i'm on the road for work", "i'm going to  create a routine there and stick with it", "mm-hmm", "that's how you survive", "what is something you believe, that other people think is insane", "or, any controversial beliefs that you have", "interesting", "and, if nothing jumps to mind, we can also come back to that", "right", "yeah, i may need to come back to that one", "okay, we'll come back to that", "what book or books have you gifted most to other people", "i'm gonna butcher this authors' name because i always do", "house of leaves", "house of leaves", "by mark danielewski", "uh-huh", "so, the reason that i say this, and that i would gift this, is that so many people now read on kindles, or technology, or things like that", "this is a book that you have to hold because there are parts of it where  you need to turn it upside down to read it", "and, i forgot the style of writing, there's actually a genre for it", "but, there are certain pages where, you are reading it and it turns in a circle", "so, it's in an entire - i think that reading a book, and holding the physical book, and turning the pages, is such a lost art", "and so, there's something - this is a book that's an entire sensory   experience", "it's a fantastic story", "it's brilliant, it's kind of like a story within a story", "but then, it requires you, as a reader, to be active and involved", "and, i think that's just so cool because you don't see stuff like that anymore", "and, especially now, when read things on their ipads, or their kindles, or whatever", "and, holding a book is something that we no longer do", "house of leaves", "yeah", "very cool", "do you have any favorite documentaries, or movies", "my all time favorite movie is the goonies", "the goonies", "it's a quality film", "it's a quality - it's not life changing, but -   any favorite character from the goonies", "data", "data", "data was great", "[inaudible] yeah", "i grew up in oregon, you just had to", "that was my jam, you know", "the goonies", "we didn't have much to claim, being from oregon", "yeah", "but, we could claim that movie", "what is the purchase, for less than $100, that is most positively impacted your life, in recent memory", "this is really funny", "so, manuka honey bandages", "huh", "and so, i get banged up a lot, racing", "yeah, i've seen", "yeah, there's some of the photos that you sent me -   right", "so, before we do these interviews i ask for a short bio, some photos that might be usable", "and, i was looking at one of them: you're climbing up this ramp, and you're just covered in blood", "so, yes", "you get banged up", "so, this past summer, i actually - there's this one obstacle called tyrolean traverse", "what's it called", "tyrolean traverse", "tyrolean", "yeah", "so, you've seen the military guys, they - it's a rope thingyou either go under it -   yeah", "it's just a rope traverse", "yeah", "but, you can also go on top of it, it saves your grip", "and, i decided one day, one race, to go on top of it, saving my grip, and i was wearing just a sports bra", "and, massive rope burn all down the front of my - and, the worst pain", "it was like a second degree burnand, i discovered that the only thing that would take away the sting were these honey bandages", "cvs was the only place that sold them", "cvs has manuka honey bandages", "- honey bandages", "the only place", "i could find them online too", "i swear, it was the only thing that got me through the next few weeks with no pain, but, now i use them all the time for all of my scrapes", "they're great antibacterial blah, blah, blah", "with the number that i bought, i'm sure it's over - i've spent way more than $100 on them, but -     manuka honey bandages, cool", "now, i usually ask about morning routines, we already covered quite a bit of that", "what other routines, or habits do you find important in your day, or week", "i - it's very easy for me to - or, i think it's very easy for a lot of people to get disconnected from people around them", "especially now, when our social media type of world - is that you like something on instagram, or favorite something on twitter, or whatever", "whatever the things are that you do", "so, it's very important for me to - i always set a time every single week, and i call my parents at the same time", "mm-hmm", "and, i call my sister, to try and make those personal connections, and stuff like that", "because it can be so impersonal now with everything that we have; technology where you can be friends with people that you've never met in real life", "so, i always try to - for me, that routine", "every sunday, at the same time calling the parents", "just kind of keeping me grounded, things like that", "do you have any wind down routine", "what does the hour before bed look like", "so, i generally -   can't wait to hear this", "no, i was just trying to think of if i actually have - because generally i'll be watching monday night raw, or some other professional wrestling", "i don't watch a lot of tv, but it's either sports, or professional wrestling when i do", "i am, generally, one of those people that is so tired by the time it's time to go to bed, that i don't really need a routine", "you don't have any necessity", "it's just, alright it's time to go to bed", "done", "out cold", "yeah", "got it", "if you could have a billboard anywhere, what would it say", "you can put anything on it", "i think i would say - i think it would be something along the lines of, \"no one owes you anything.\" and, i think that this has been something that, lately, i feel that there's such a level of entitlement now in people", "that, \"i deserve this,\" or, \"i blah, blah, blah this.\" and, at the end of the day it's hard work", "the people that i find the most successful people, that i - one thing i've always prided myself on is, i've worked, really goddamn hard for everything that i've gotten, or that i've done in my life", "and, you can't expect handouts from people", "at the end of the day, all that you can count on, really, is yourself", "and so, i don't expect people to give me anything", "and, i really wish - you see people now - i don't know", "the level of entitlement that people think that they deserve a handout, or deserve help sometimes", "sometimes, i'm like, \"no, make it yourself", "make your own opportunities.\"  yeah", "that's very pronounced here in silicon valley too", "it's like, \"i know you just had a great idea when you went to the bathroom, but it's not worth $50 million yet, i'm sorry.\"  yeah", "exactly", "so, this is not one of my normal rapid fire questions, and i'm sure i'm gonna get a lot of grief for this from my fans", "but, i have to ask because i know a lot of very successful women, ceo's, and so on2012, second place overall -   yeah", "you could have, potentially - it's well within the realm of possibility that you could've won the whole thing", "yeah", "do you find it hard to date", "is it - because i'm imagining", "yeah", "if i put myself in your shoes, it must be - and you're extremely successful in your career", "is it hard for you to find someone you respect enough to date", "i mean, in the mental, physical, emotional toughness spheres", "so, i don't think that it's so much me - here's the thing", "that's how it always starts", "it's not me, it's him", "no", "i honestly - i tend to be attracted to be people that are almost - i don't want to say the exact opposite of me because then that sounds like i'm attracted to people who aren't successful", "but, what i've found is that i need somebody who is very complimentary to me in terms of very, kind of - i admire people that are super laid back, and go with the flow, and very adaptable, and just everything that i'm not", "mm-hmm", "and so, i think that for me it's not so hard to find people like that", "i think sometimes you do get - you'll hear - it takes a certain type of guy who can be secure with being with a woman who beats 99% of the dudes at a sport, or whatever", "sure", "and, that feels weird to say because that feels like i'm being like, \"look at me, i'm some badass.\"  no, no, no", "the facts are the facts", "but, it's - i think that it takes a guy who is very secure in his own right", "i can't date somebody who is not secure in who he is", "mm-hmm", "because then that would just be disastrous", "doesn't sound like it would get very far", "nah", "what advice would you give your 25-year-old self, and place us - 20 and 25", "i'd be interested to get it for both ages", "right", "so, where were you, what were you doing at 20, and then 25", "so, 20 i was finishing up college, probably just getting ready to apply to law school; super hardcore, drive, i was going to be a partner at a law firm one day", "all of those things", "i think, at that time, i would tell myself to relax, and that you can't predict where life is going to take you", "mm-hmm", "because now, looking back, would i ever expect that i would be the world's top obstacle racer -  we didn't even know what the fuck obstacle - it wasn't even around at that time", "it wasn't even a thing, yeah", "it wasn't even a thing", "and so, i think at 25, i was finishing up law school, and i was starting my career as an attorney", "so, it would probably be similar", "but, i think what i would tell - i'm actually gonna give you what i would tell my 28-year-old self", "perfect", "which is when i started all of this obstacle racing stuff", "and, i would tell myself, \"it really doesn't matter.\" no", "okay, that sounds bad but, \"don't take it so seriously.\" and, at the end of the -   the racing itself", "the racing itself because when you reach - it started out as totally fun, and then you reach a certain level of success, and then everyone - then it becomes this pressure, and everything like thatand, i think that it's not - all of the stress, and the pressure, and everything that i would put on myself from it, it's not worth it", "it doesn't change the outcome", "i'm either ready, or i'm not to beat somebody", "so, at the end of the day, keep it all in perspective   and, it's kind of hilarious", "i'm running around in the mud, being shocked by electrical things, and running around for 24 hours in a wet suit", "just keep that in perspective", "yeah", "it's kind of ludicrous what i'm doing", "so, have fun with it", "mm-hmm", "because there's so much time that i think that i've wasted, putting so much pressure on myself, and not having fun", "and now, i've come full circle, and i'm like, \"eh, it's just fun.\"  who would you - who is someone, or who are people, you would like to meet someday", "if any are", "god, see that list is massive", "yeah", "who is up at the top of the list", "ronda rousey", "ronda rousey, yeah", "i like to meet strong - i have an entire list of strong females who are at the top of what they do", "yeah, she's on my list too", "but then, that also extends to other things that are not athletically inclined", "so, you see charlotte sandburg, and the females that have made names for themselves as top executives, and things like that", "i'm not a, \"rah, rah, girl power,\" type of person, but finding other women like that, and seeing what makes them tick, and seeing how they survive is always really interesting for me", "what, if any, asks or requests do you have for the audience", "and, this is the last question", "asks or requests", "yeah, anything you'd like them to do, or think about, or consider, or all of the above", "right", "i think  that one of things that i've learned, and what i would tell people, is to be open to experiences,", "especially with - they're probably - people, if they're sitting here listening to this, are either already into obstacle course racing, and are like, \"man, this shit's bananas, it's great,\" and i don't need to convince them of anythingor, if they've happened upon this, and they're like, \"we don't understand what this chick is doing, actually.\" i don't know", "i would say, go out there and try something new", "mm-hmm", "so, if you wanna go out and run an obstacle course race, greatbut, i wouldn't' be where i am today without just saying, \"sure,\" and trying something", "and, seeing where that leads me", "so, i think that's always important to keep in mind", "try something new", "yeah, yeah", "that's good advice", "do something -   and, i'm not asking them to do something there, right", "no, no, no", "i think that's good advice", "do something just for the fuck of it", "right", "i think it's - coming back to your, \"don't take it so seriously,\" not everything has to figure into your five year plan", "right", "and, that's hard because for me, i've always been that, super planner, five year person  yeah", "so, it's something that i have to actually remind myself", "\"try something new, amelia.\" just do it", "yeah", "why not do it", "that  was one of my - i'm not gonna call it a resolution because it wasn't a new years resolution, but i did a lot of unusual experiments last year that we won't get into right now", "but, one of the realizations was, be playful", "yeah", "you don't have to be so goddamn serious about things all of the time", "just do something that doesn't have an explicit point, or and angle", "right", "or, whatever it might be", "well, somebody told me the other day, that the only thing - at the end of the day, the only thing we have is time   if you really cut through all the bullshit out there - and this is so   funny", "when you were asking me about, \"who do you think is successful?\" seriously, i think the most successful people out there are people that are happy, that are just - they may not have it allthey may be dirt poor, they may not be educated, they may whatever", "but, if they can start everyday of life smiling, and just generally happy - if you break it all down, all we have is time, so why spend it being miserable", "so, go do something that makes you happy, and have fun with it because you're not taking it with you when you go", "yeah", "your most valuable, non-renewable resource", "exactly", "as far as we know, maybe", "well, right", "when my time finally comes, and i realize that there's a super cool world on the other side, i'm gonna be like, \"goddamn it.\"  yeah", "well, amelia thanks so much for taking the time", "thank you", "and, where can people say hello, or find you on the interwebs, and so on", "on my grossly-in-need-of-an-update website, ameliabooneracing.com", "but, i actually am most active on twitterthe handle is ameliaboone  boone with an \"e\"", "what", "boone with an \"e\" at the end", "amelia boone, b-o-o-n-e", "correct", "but, be forewarned, i tweet a fair amount about the seahawks, and professional wrestling", "so, if you're not into that, you probably don't want to follow me", "and then, i'm on instagram as well", "it's arboone11 because ameliaboone was already taken by the time i joined that", "arboone11", "correct", "and, i'm on facebook", "i don't have an athlete page because i don't really like that, or believe in that, but you can follow me", "but, i don't really become friends with people i haven't met before in life because that weirds me out", "so, twitter", "so, twitter and instagram are your best bets", "twitter and instagram, cool", "well, this has been a blast  yeah", "everybody listening, we will link to the books, and so on - the manuka honey bandages - and whatnot", "everything mentioned in the show notes", "you can just go to fourhourworkweek.com, all spelled out", "fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, and that will have all episodes, including this one", "and, i'll create just a short link that you can go to", "or, not a short link, but a url", "you can go to fourhourworkweek.com/amelia, that will go straight to this episode", "and, amelia, once again, thank you so much for taking the time", "thank you", "i appreciate it", "and, i would say let's go for a run sometime, but i have some training to do before i'm prepared for that", "and, to everybody listening, as always, thank you so much for sticking around, and we'll see you soon", "hey guys, this is tim again", "just a few more things before you take off", "number one, this is five bullet friday", "do you want to get a short email from me", "would you enjoy getting a short email from me every friday, that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend", "five bullet friday is a very short email where i share the coolest things that i've found, or that i've been pondering over the week", "that could include favorite new albums that i've discovered; it could include gizmos and gadgets, and all sorts of shit that i've somehow dug up in the world of esoteric, as i do; it could include favorite articles that i have read, and that i've shared with my close friends, for instance", "it's very short", "it's just a little, tiny bite of goodness, before you head off for the weekend", "so, if you want to receive that, check it out", "just go to fourhourworkweek.com, that's fourhourworkweek.com, all spelled out", "and, just drop in your   email, and you will get the very next one", "and, if you sign up, i hope you enjoy it", "duration: 99 minutes"]}
