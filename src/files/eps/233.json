So they may come from chess, entertainment, athletics, or otherwise, military, for instance. But what are the common habits, the favorite books, the routines that you can apply to your own life? That is what I try to tease out. In this episode, we have a very special guest. He was highly requested, has been requested for years by thousands of you at this point. Cory Booker. That is C-O-R-Y, @corybooker on Twitter and elsewhere. He\u2019s an American politician and the junior United States Senator from New Jersey. Now, I want to say right up front, I generally have an allergy to politics and long-term listeners know this. I very seldom dig in and try to penetrate that world. But, a few things. No. 1, Cory and I actually go back a ways. We\u2019ve spent time together. Second, his story is endlessly fascinating to me. For instance, he\u2019s faced down death threats from gangs, run into burning buildings and much more, aside from all of the official stuff that you see. That, I think, is worth mining. He\u2019s also very well spoken and very well educated and pulls from many different disciplines. We cover a lot in this wide-ranging catchup, which we did in person in Austin, Texas, including his diet, lessons from early mentors, as in athletics, routines, most impactful books, the books he\u2019s gifted the most to the people, learning how to \u201cstreet fight,\u201d in New Jersey after a Rhodes Scholarship and a fantastic education and much, much more. Cory began his political career, as some of you probably know, as a City Councilor from 1998 to 2002 in Newark, New Jersey\u2019s largest city. He later then served as Mayor of Newark. Under his leadership, Newark entered its biggest period of economic growth since the 1960s. The first new downtown hotels were constructed in 40 years, the first new office towers in 20 years, etc. He then won the Senate Democratic primary in August of 2013 and then won the general election on October 16, 2013, becoming the first African-American U.S. Senator from New Jersey. I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did. I always enjoy spending time with Cory. So without further ado, here is Cory Booker. Cory, welcome to the show. Cory Booker: It\u2019s pretty amazing being here, actually. Tim Ferriss: I am so thrilled to finally be sitting here with you to have this conversation. We met many years ago and I\u2019ve wanted to get you on the podcast ever since I realized the podcast was going to be more than drinking too much with my one or two closest friends in San Francisco and embarrassing myself. Cory Booker: I love the drunk taking questions. Tim Ferriss: Oh, the drunk dial episodes? Cory Booker: Yeah, those episodes are great. But this is one of those moments where literally when my team, my team that works with me in the Senate, says to me, Tim wants to have you on his show. It\u2019s like this moment where I\u2019m like, wait a minute. I see the show as you having masters of their domain on the show and the fact that I want to be on the show, I have this severe problem of imposter syndrome. Like I am not worthy. I\u2019m a huge fan of your show. It has literally influenced my life in a very significant way, as you did. In fact, when we met at Dialogue, I was way overweight and you took the time to stand with me as everybody left. We were at some table and just coached me for ten minutes. I then went on to lose \u2013 it was probably the best shape I had been in until more recently. But you just coached me. I followed your gospel and I got myself in shape. By that point, I was like, this guy changed my life and I just became a fan. I read The 4-Hour Workweek, read The 4-Hour Body. My staff just got me your most recent book. I\u2019m just thrilled to be here. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m worthy. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I think you\u2019re worthy, more than worthy. I have so many questions that I was waiting to ask you, whether in person just over dinner or on the podcast. So I figured why not just do it on the podcast? I wanted to ask you to start maybe at the beginning, because I came into this not knowing a whole lot about your upbringing and childhood. Could you tell us a little bit about your parents? Cory Booker: I hit the lottery to be born to these two amazing American folks who both have tough backgrounds. They are black people who were born in the \u201830s basically. Growing up under Jim Crow. My father, especially, very poor, single mom to a mother who couldn\u2019t take care of him, then a grandmother that couldn\u2019t take care of him. I\u2019ve now, since I was on this great show called \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d So I actually now know about my roots going back to the 1600s in America, actually, amazingly. But for that branch of the family, my father\u2019s, is poverty, poverty, poverty, slavery. These parents came from tough environments, but both were fortunate enough to get to a college. Through the interventions of a lot of really great people, especially my father, it was a community of people, when his mom couldn\u2019t take care of him, that took him in and bent the branches of my family towards college and usually towards being middle income. They pitched in money. I don\u2019t know what their ROI is on those people that gave like a buck to my Dad to get his first semester\u2019s tuition paid for and then work his way through college. But incredible amounts of individual kindness got my Dad to college. And then hey, great, you land in college right during the civil rights movement and you got black people, white people, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, all pouring into the South for you to basically give you equal opportunity in this country. So doors started opening up to blacks that never had been before. My parents both get to Washington, D.C. after college, and my Dad \u2013 thanks to, again, the activism of blacks and whites, Christians, Jews, Republicans, and Democrats who were just saying to these companies, you\u2019ve kind of got to start hiring black people and companies opened their doors. So my Dad became the first black salesman for an oil company, first black buyer, I think, for a department store, then he became IBM\u2019s first black salesman for the entire Virginia area. What happens when you let people at the table to have a fair chance to compete, he kicked ass. Excuse me. The next thing you know, he\u2019s like their top 5 percent of their global salesmen and gets promoted to New Jersey with his new wife. At that point, I was four months old. We moved to Jersey. That\u2019s how my Jersey origins come. Tim Ferriss: I spent a good amount of time in Jersey. We\u2019re going to get to Jersey. We\u2019re going to spend a lot of time on Jersey, I suspect. What were some of the lessons or sayings that you found most impactful or have retained from your parents? Cory Booker: Well, look, James Baldwin says that children are never good at listening to their elders, but they never fail to imitate them. So I\u2019ve learned that my parents said certain things that I abided by because that\u2019s how they lived. My parents told me a whole bunch of stuff that I didn\u2019t embody because they didn\u2019t live in allegiance to what they told me to do. Look, my parents embody this interesting ethic. They were very entrepreneurial people. They were very business-minded people, but they also \u2013 it almost felt like they just had this debt to society because they knew the extraordinary acts of love and kindness that got there. My Dad\u2019s work ethic and my Mom\u2019s work ethic \u2013 as I get older, I more appreciate my mother. I don\u2019t think I appreciated it as much when I was young. But my father was one of these guys that like if it was a snow day and I\u2019m in first grade all excited, I would be woken in the morning by 5:00 a.m. to my Dad shoveling the driveway when everybody\u2019s staying home, because he was going to go to work and be the first person at work no matter what. My Dad, even though he had this incredible work ethic and climbed the ladder into middle class through the sheer grit that he had, he also had this understanding that if it wasn\u2019t for lots, thousands of people that you don\u2019t even know, I wouldn\u2019t be here. My Dad had this powerful story he told that got more dramatic the older I got. You have to understand, I\u2019m walking around \u2013 by the time I\u2019m 18 years old, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m the greatest gift to the world. I\u2019m a two-position, high school, All State high school football player, All American high school football player, president of my class, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m somebody. My father would look at me and say, \u201cBoy, don\u2019t you dare walk around this house like you hit a triple. You were born on third base.\u201d It\u2019s like \u201cYou think you\u2019re special? You know how many people,\u201d \u2013 and I would get the lecture, you know? It was easy for him to do that lecture because he knew that I knew that I was very different than my peers in the sense that I was black. As my father called us, we were the four raisins in the tub of sweet vanilla ice cream. We were definitely not the norm in terms of race in the town. So then he could easily tell me how I got there. Look, when my parents moved to New Jersey, I grew up in the northeastern county, the one that looks across the Palisades, across the Hudson River at New York, north of the George Washington Bridge. My father basically is like, \u201cLook, what took us to get here?\u201d When my parents when they tried to buy homes in Bergen County, there was only a handful of towns in this 70-town county, 70-plus-town county, that would let blacks move in. They didn\u2019t have laws at the time. People think the North \u2013 it was the South that that the segregation laws. No, it was real estate steering. Black family shows up. \u201cLet me show you homes in Teaneck or Englewood or Hackensack. You don\u2019t want to go up here.\u201d So what my parents ended up doing, a group of just \u2013 again, blacks and whites joined together to create a storefront operation called the Fair Housing Council. They would go with blacks, my parents, and send a white couple right behind them. My parents would look at a house, be told it was sold. The white couple would come and find out the house is still for sale. On this house that my parents fell in love with, 123 Norma Road in Harrington Park, New Jersey, they were told it was sold. The white couple came and found out it was still for sale. The white couple puts a bid on the house, papers are drawn up. On the day of the closing, my father shows up and a volunteer lawyer, a guy named Marty Friedman, a Jewish lawyer who just on his own time wanted to help black families out. Literally, the real estate agent stands up angrily when he realizes he got caught in a sting operation. He doesn\u2019t relent. He doesn\u2019t say, yeah, I broke the law. No, he punches my Dad\u2019s lawyer in the face and [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: Always a great response. Cory Booker: And puts a dog on my Dad. Literally, sics his dog on my Dad. I always joke that every time, as I got older and older, the dog got bigger. Eventually, it was like a pack of wolves. \u201cAnd I fought a pack of wolves so you could eat that tuna fish sandwich.\u201d But then we move into this home. For me, as my father would say to me, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re drinking from wells of freedom and liberty and opportunity that you didn\u2019t dig. You\u2019re eating from banquet tables prepared for you by your ancestors.\u201d This is the kind of stuff my parents inspired my understanding to recognize that if you have the luck \u2013 I just had a Senate hearing last week about Yemen and 3 million internally displaced people, war, it\u2019s a country on the brink of famine, which is not something that the U.N. does lightly to talk about widespread famine. If you have the fortune, the blessing of being born an American, you are in the rarefied of rarefied airs in humanity, if you\u2019re American in the 21st century. What my parents did a good job of bringing fully to my consciousness through the portal and lens of the black experience, but frankly I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Irish-American, if you\u2019re Indian-American, this is all of us how much effort had to go. It wasn\u2019t Abraham Lincoln and FDR, no. It was good folk, ordinary folks who just said, \u201cYou know what? I may be Jewish, you may be Christian. I may be black, you may be white, but we are in this together. If you\u2019re facing an injustice, it\u2019s a problem with me.\u201d I\u2019d hear, before I\u2019d even studied this stuff in history, \u201cSon, people stormed beaches in Normandy for you. They swept floors for you. They went on freedom rides for you.\u201d So if any sort of family mantra that was there for my brother and I is, yeah, you have an obligation to take the blessings God gave you and work is the most important thing. Don\u2019t let anybody ever outwork you. You and I have shared this in sports or what have you. Work ethic is important. But service has got to be a part of that too. You owe a debt you can\u2019t pay back to your ancestors. You\u2019ve got to pay it forward by paying it to other people. Tim Ferriss: So you played ball. You ended up at Sandford. Cory Booker: I always say I got into Stanford because of a 4.0 and 1,600. 4.0 yards per carry, 1,600 receiving yards. Tim Ferriss: You grew up, as I understand it, about a mile or two away from a previous guest, John Crowley. So he suggested that I ask you about \u2013 and I know nothing about football, so I\u2019m getting into the deep end of my ignorance pool here, but Lou Holtz trying to recruit you. Maybe you could provide some context for people who don\u2019t even know who Lou Holtz is. Cory Booker: Well, Lou Holtz is probably one of the greatest American college football coaches of all times. I was, in all fairness, because the older we get, the better we were at our sports, but in all fairness, I was probably the most overrated high school football player ever. People thought I could part the seas of linebackers and score anytime I wanted to. It was a lot of hype. I think the song back then by Public Enemy was \u201cDon\u2019t Believe the Hype.\u201d That was written, I think, about my football career. But I had a choice of going anywhere. I just looked at it. You went to Princeton. Again, this idea that okay, I have a chance to get a full scholarship to any college in the country. I\u2019m going to go \u2013 because of my parents\u2019 wiring \u2013 to the best academic school I can go to. I looked at Duke and Stanford and UVA. But Notre Dame was definitely on that list. Lou Holtz is probably one of the most persuasive human beings ever and I always talk about the fact \u2013 and definitely an embellished story \u2013 but going out there and Lou Holtz, who is a short man. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and I would say he\u2019s like 5\u2019 and a smidgen. But a booming guy. You look up to him right when you meet him. He just gives me the best sell you could imagine. We actually go into the Notre Dame locker room and there\u2019s my jersey with my high school number on it. Needless to say, you\u2019re 17, 18 years old. This is amazing. Lou Holtz goes, \u201cTake a knee.\u201d When Lou Holtz says take a knee, I\u2019m a Christian boy, but I bowed before that man. Then he gives me the best pre-game speech I\u2019d ever heard in my life. He pulls from all history. He\u2019s talking about the Gipper. He even talks about Rudy, for crying out loud. He goes to Rudy. So I\u2019m all hyped up and then he goes, \u201cRise, Cory Booker, Rise.\u201d It didn\u2019t take a muscle twitch. I literally elevated up into the air after he told me that. I\u2019m ready to go out and chop down trees. Then Notre Dame, you go through this little tunnel. There\u2019s like a four-leaf clover there or something you hit. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re black, if you\u2019re from Bangladesh, when you touch that Irish, the Irish Isles call you. You feel your Irish ancestry. I\u2019m fully baked. Then I walk down through the tunnel. You get on the field and Holtz is still in your ear and it\u2019s like as if he\u2019s narrating your moment on that field. I\u2019m walking down and \u201cCory Booker, you\u2019re going to score a touchdown in that end zone.\u201d So you get to that end zone and then you turn around and the field is like a bowl. But there\u2019s a building behind the field that\u2019s called \u2013 it\u2019s their library I think. On the field, there\u2019s a picture, a mural of Jesus Christ with his arms up as if he\u2019s saying touchdown. In fact, his nickname is \u201cTouchdown Jesus.\u201d The only time you can see it \u2013 so I turn around and now I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Baha\u2019i, Sikh, Christian, Jewish, you see Touchdown Jesus after Lou Holtz has pumped you up \u2013 it is a conversion moment. I knew what Jesus wanted from me at that moment. He wanted me to score a touchdown in that end zone. I\u2019m swearing I\u2019m going to score a touchdown. I get home and my parents are like, \u201cWhere are you going to school?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to Notre Dame!\u201d It took them psychologists and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: They had to deprogram you. Cory Booker: They had to deprogram me to eventually get me to go to Stanford when I realized that we played Notre Dame in their end zone. In my senior year, my best career game was against Notre Dame. We weren\u2019t even ranked in the top 50. Notre Dame was ranked No. 1 in the country. We were going in and everybody said we were going to get killed by 10, 20 points. They score a touchdown, we score a touchdown. We\u2019re actually staying with them. I had this pass over the middle and Todd Light, an All-American corner \u2013 I have one move in sports and he must have not watched the film, but it\u2019s basically me throwing my hips one way and running the other way as quickly as I can. He actually fell down and I\u2019m running towards Touchdown Jesus. I\u2019m hearing the Lord calling to me. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve wanted from you for your life.\u201d I get tackled from behind by some spawn from Hell, who takes me out. Eventually, we scored a touchdown and won the game. But my Notre Dame experiences \u2013 I love the school. If anything, I learned from that because we had no right to be in that end zone. I used to always tell people my true lesson from that story is that if you have the right team, you can be up against people that are superior athletes, superior intellect or whatever, but a good team, people together, can beat any group of great individuals. Tim Ferriss: Okay, that is a fantastic story. We are going to talk about delegating a team I think a little bit later because there were some listener questions about that. But I want to talk about persuasion. You mentioned Lou was very persuasive. I think of you as very persuasive and you\u2019re a very gifted speaker. I think we\u2019re going to take a slight left turn. It\u2019s going to seem that way, but it\u2019s related. We talked a little bit about this before we started recording. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, but you ran a student-run crisis hotline. Cory Booker: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: At Stanford. Could you talk about that? Specifically, I want to know what did you learn about that experience and what works when you are on a crisis hotline. Cory Booker: This is a crisis hotline called The Bridge at Stanford. It was probably one of the best life experiences because I was sort of a teenager going into my early 20s and it was the first non-profit I ran in this collective of other leaders. There were five of us that lived at the center 24 hours a day, would cover the night. You have to understand when I just started as a counselor there, I\u2019m this 18-year-old or 19-year-old young man who, a lot of us I don\u2019t think get this understanding that we\u2019ve lived our lives in our own lane and we don\u2019t necessarily get to pull back the screen and talk to other people about their experiences beyond the niceties we\u2019d exchange every day. I can\u2019t remember who said about \u201cBe kind to one another because we\u2019re all fighting a hard battle.\u201d It might have been Socrates or someone. But it basically punched me square in my nose about how important kindness and empathy is because when I started sitting on that phone and on a Friday night, I was so shaken. Because we would have rape calls. I had women that were there, I still remember one girl named Alison who would pick up women that were escaping spousal abuse. There was another counselor there named Danielle Bowe, another amazingly beautiful human being. I just had no idea how \u2013 again, this early \u201880s, early \u201890s \u2013 how ignorant I was about gay and lesbian Americans and how many biases had stemmed from my ignorance. Sitting down and having people calling about their experiences coming out. Hearing the truth of people talking about thinking about killing themselves because they are not attracted to someone of a different sex or talking about the horrors they experienced and abuses they experienced. Or eating disorders and being in forms of honest conversation about how just saying something to somebody like, \u201cHey, you\u2019re gaining some weight,\u201d and how comments like that can hurt. Or what it\u2019s like just growing up in an environment where you\u2019re constantly being told that your worth is based upon how much weight you have. I can go on and on and on, but it was one of those places where I felt like Stanford is great and my course load got great, but I learned so much about empathy and about listening and about non-judgmentalism, sort of the fundamental core. We literally had the first five rules of peer counseling that were about empathy, that were about non-judgmentalism, about listening. Tim Ferriss: Do you recall specifically what any of those rules were? Cory Booker: Some of them were as simple as \u201cBe non-judgmental.\u201d That\u2019s something that I think \u2013 I literally was just talking with one of my closest friends about that yesterday because they were going off about someone who was involved in a protest or something and how it wasn\u2019t sincere and so on and so forth. We just don\u2019t realize how often we\u2019re casting judgment when we know nothing about the person. We know nothing about their struggle and we just are so quick to judge other people. How harsh it would be back to us. To actually be taught to be a counselor to somebody and hold no judgment of them whatsoever or to suppress that and just be there to listen and to give them empathy. All these are often tags for love. It was a powerful lesson for me. I guess what I\u2019m saying to you is I think there\u2019s something about persuasion that people often go about it as thinking about how am I going to convince you to do something. I think about that from the start of no, it\u2019s not about me and what I\u2019m going to do to you to get you to do something, it\u2019s actually about me being there for you and opening myself up to create a safe space for me to actually listen and hear you. This has been a hard lesson. When I was living in really a tough environment in Newark \u2013 when I first moved there I was living in some high-rise projects which became public housing \u2013 it\u2019s like these same lessons you\u2019re meant to hear on your journey in life, when you start getting the same thing over and over again to try to teach you. I think the universe tries to do it the easy way first, but when you see the same thing coming \u2013 but this idea of empathy. Now, in our society, and you and I sort of touched on this, I\u2019m one of these people that gets kind of bothered that we\u2019ve stopped listening to each other. I wish I could find this study and I asked my team to help me find it. But I remember being on an airplane reading a study, and I thought it was USA Today about a public policy position in education. They said this is the Democratic position. Immediately 80 percent of Republicans were against it. They didn\u2019t even know it. They flipped it around. Democrats were the same way. They said this is a Republican policy. 80 percent of Democrats were against it. It just shifted by just labeling it Republican or Democrat. What I often find is we\u2019re at a point in our society right now where we have just stopped listening to each other and stopped being empathetic, and instead are leading with that judgment. The problem with that is it disables us and our ability to come together to do the kind of things that need to move our society forward. That\u2019s why I think now more than ever, and I say this in my speeches all the time, in America we need a courageous empathy, where we are willing to let go of our own ego and tune into to another human being, to really listen to them. I may not agree with that Black Lives Matter march. They may offend me, but we\u2019re all wired the same way. So why are they out there yelling and screaming? Is it because they\u2019re bad and I\u2019m judging them, or am I taking time to really try to surrender my own position for a minute and listen to that person in the Midwest who is a serious Trump supporter and try to really understand where they\u2019re coming from. Tim Ferriss: I want to talk about both \u2013 and I might separate these two out \u2013 but the empathy and the courage, which are going to be recurring themes. On the empathy side of things, what you just said reminded me on a micro level of what Bryan Johnson said to me once. He described all-hands meetings or town hall meetings for Braintree, which he then sold to eBay for, I want to say, $600 million or something like that, $900 million. At that point, who cares? I mean, it\u2019s a big number. He said that when he had all-hands meetings, people were very hesitant to bring up certain problems. He would stand there and he would make jokes about himself and mistakes he had made and wait until, as he put it, people would bring up the pebble in their shoe. He said very often that was all needed to solve the problem was to give someone the space and elicit them to talk about the pebble in their shoe. In the case of the crisis hotline, what are some of the tools that you used to either make people feel better or calm them down? How do you go about doing that when, let\u2019s say, even in your own head you might be subconsciously judging a situation or making assumptions. Are there any particular lines or questions? Because you\u2019re no stranger to conflict. You\u2019ve been in a fair number of street fights. Cory Booker: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Not literal, but, well, I mean, you certainly have. There\u2019s a lot of excitement in the biography of Cory Booker. But how do you calm people down and diffuse situations? Are there any particular words or questions or any tactics that you use? Cory Booker: There\u2019s definitely a tactic and I want to talk about that. Just to give more affirmation of what Bryan was doing. I wrote a book the year before last called United. The best reaction I was hoping from people who read the book was to say, wait a minute, this is not what a politician would write. Because I wanted to write about \u2013 and there\u2019s five or six major instances in a book or actually a lot of more smaller ones \u2013 of this is me being a jerk. This is me being a royal ass. This is a big mistake I made. I don\u2019t mind being a little vulnerable here because I find that vulnerability actually creates a climate for all of us to learn. I think it\u2019s bad when we put people on pedestals. I think it\u2019s so much better when we \u2013 this is why I like Biography \u2013 when we see people. Like Lyndon Johnson was a jerk in terms of the way he treated other people. Martin Luther King, Cornel West always talks about it, the Santa Claus-ification of Martin Luther King. He was a complex man with flaws. I think that makes it more accessible and real when you realize that. So I think that what he was doing was creating an environment where, let me tell you what I did that was really dumb, it gives people a safe space for them to start sharing and build more effective teams when you have those kind of connections. But in terms of a tactic for counseling, which is a tactic that we all know already, those of us who practice this, who\u2019ve been up at night and you can\u2019t sleep, you have anxiety. You open a book and you just write down what you\u2019re anxious about. Suddenly, it\u2019s real and on the paper and it\u2019s a really a good way to get to a point where you go from the emotional anxiety of it all to suddenly seeing it in a more objective way. Not that it still doesn\u2019t have emotional triggers and the like, but you see it in a more objective way. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably done that yourself. Tim Ferriss: I actually very routinely do something called Morning Pages, which is effectively trapping those anxieties and monkey mind-generated insecurities or emotions on paper so that I can get on with my day. Cory Booker: Right, and most of us don\u2019t understand how in our own lives, something simple \u2013 we allow our minds to do things to us that are horrible. The most important conversations you have every day are the ones you have with yourself, that you\u2019re not even often aware of. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a great way to put it. Cory Booker: We\u2019re driving ourselves often insane with these scripts. Sometimes they\u2019re just a little bit below the consciousness of the scripts we\u2019re running. Sometimes when you take a pause \u2013 this is why just breathing in and out, just taking a moment to remember to breath or meditation is a tool that I love that you talk about also, but writing something down. In a counseling setting, often what moves a person to call a crisis hotline is they\u2019re at a peak moment of emotion or distress or worry. That\u2019s where the active listening comes in. People have this mis-idea about being a counselor that they\u2019re somehow going in there, getting great advice. I can\u2019t solve your problems. But you are equipped. From a person of faith, I don\u2019t really believe the universe puts anything on you or God puts anything on you that you can\u2019t handle. Sometimes you need to know the right people to go to or the right person to ask. But I think the tactic of just allowing somebody to talk and being a good filter or paraphraser back to the person. So maybe it\u2019s not physically writing it down, but that person is beginning to hear themselves and be able to sort through what\u2019s going on and help them start to see strategies that they could be pursuing to make themselves better. We all have so much more wisdom inside of us than we give ourselves credit for. Tim Ferriss: I want to flash forward, given the Memento-like scripting or lack of scripting in these conversations, I\u2019m sure chronologically it will be challenged, but we\u2019ll jump around a little bit. As we were doing a sound check before we started, I asked you what you had for breakfast today and you said, \u201cI\u2019m fasting today.\u201d Cory Booker: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Now, I have, as you know, a deep interest in fasting. I thought that we might touch on a ten-day hunger strike. Correct me if this is inaccurate. But as I understand, it was to bring attention to open-air drug dealing and related violence and so on at the time. Can you place us in terms of what you were doing at the time and why you chose to take that approach? Cory Booker: Right. Your question has so many things I want to talk about with you because the whole concept of fasting and the benefits of fasting, I so want to talk to you about it because I\u2019ve learned so much from you about it already. Now it\u2019s become a regular part of my practice. Tim Ferriss: How do you fast? I\u2019m curious. Cory Booker: To take you through the Tim Ferriss effects on my life, which are many \u2013 you are such a good soul because you make yourself vulnerable. I think that\u2019s one of your attributes. You know that you are a schmuck at times, like we all are. And you admit that. Which again, makes me feel a brotherhood with you. But yet you have like my father, that dogged work ethic where you\u2019re willing \u2013 and also a willingness to hurl yourself off cliffs with no parachute. Tim Ferriss: As my MRIs can attest to. Cory Booker: Yes. And I find, by the way, I\u2019m in a profession that does not like risk. Politicians are like what is the least amount of risk that I can have because I don\u2019t want to offend anybody, God forbid. You have no problems. I think you\u2019re good at that. But I think my best times learning \u2013 and we can get back to the ten-day hunger strike, because this was a big moment \u2013 when I take the greatest risks and I just hurl myself off. That was an act of desperation. But I love the fact that you\u2019re willing to use yourself and embrace this idea that I don\u2019t have all the answers and I\u2019m going to try to learn something. I\u2019ve following you through a lot of your journeys and learned a lot myself and hacks, shortcuts, by learning from you. So you go to that moment where we met and talked deeper, years ago. It was 2009, I think, where you helped me get my physical health back. But it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always seemed to be able to sacrifice my physical health and my own wellbeing and relationships. This terrible view I\u2019ve had to fight where it\u2019s all about the service, it\u2019s all about the mission. But self-care, I\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve gotten wiser, is so important. It\u2019s like Stephen Covey sharpening the saw. But most of us forget that. I then went back and gained a ridiculous amount of weight. I was over 300 pounds again. It was a few of my friends talking to be about intermittent fasting that was a tactic. Obviously, there was a lot more going on when you\u2019re in that moment, but it was a great tactic to use. It was everybody from a Congresswoman who was hearing this. A lot of people started giving me that information. But it was Ezra Klein. I was on his podcast and we started talking about it. He was just talking about not eating until noon most days, or 11:00 a.m., if I remember exactly. So I hurled myself into trying it. The more I tried it, I found so many benefits to my life of doing two to three days a week, of doing what they call intermittent fasting, 500 calories or less a day. I can talk to you about all the benefits I found, but your podcasts about the subject matter about everything from cancers to Alzheimer\u2019s. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Dominic D\u2019Aogstino, probably. Cory Booker: That was exactly it. But I remember that you said something on one of your podcasts about the stress you used to have if you missed a meal. Oh, God, I\u2019m in the airport, I missed breakfast. Where am I going to get this? And how much peace I have now where even on days I\u2019m eating, I\u2019m like wait a minute, I\u2019ve gone three days without eating. Why am I stressing over that? Or just the mind space. It clogs your head thinking about food and all the time that suddenly I get a more zen-like path. My Chief of Staff, who\u2019s sitting in here to leap at me should I say something that he\u2019s unhappy with, but on days that I eat, I get that 3:00, 4:00 exhaustion where I need a nap. On days I\u2019m fasting, I don\u2019t feel the need to take a nap. So I can go on about intermittent fasting. I\u2019m of these people, again, like you in my life, there have been moments where I\u2019ve just said, I\u2019m going to try something for three months, like becoming a vegetarian. I was a peak athlete at the time. I just said I\u2019m going to try this and see what it does to my body. I stayed with vegetarianism first and foremost, I\u2019d like to say it was for environmental or ethical reasons. My body just jumped to a whole new level of performance when I first shifted to becoming a vegetarian. So that was the first thing that sort of like, wow, this feels great. But this is something I tried in my life, intermittent fasting, that really works. It\u2019s very different than the ten-day hunger strike. You\u2019ve inspired me. You said you now do some days just water, as you see me here drinking this green juice. Tim Ferriss: Green juice. No, there are different ways to go about it. We\u2019ll get into fasting for a second. There are those like Valter Longo, for instance, a researcher who\u2019s talked a lot about the fast mimicking diet, which is generally, I think it is fewer than 500 calories per day for anywhere from say three to five days. I\u2019ve tended to go more in the water fast direction, maybe allowing some fats like coconut oil or MCT oil, which is something that Dominic D\u2019Agostino, who is the Ph.D. who first talked about fasting on the podcast, or Peter Attia, another, in that case, an M.D. example. Let\u2019s talk about ten. Because ten is serious commitment. Cory Booker: Right. The one thing you do that I can\u2019t is testing your blood and seeing if you\u2019re hitting ketosis. I listen to all that and say to myself, \u201cDear, God, Tim. I can\u2019t my blood tested.\u201d Tim Ferriss: But I can tell you, at ten days, you\u2019re in ketosis, for sure. Cory Booker: But you have to, just before I get into this ten-day fast, my Chief of Staff and I were in the Middle East. I wanted to go to Iraq. We were meeting everybody from the Prime Minister to the leader of the opposition. We were in Baghdad. When we got there, I decide, you know what? I\u2019m going to, the entire time I\u2019m here, I\u2019m just going to fast. It was almost this sort of spiritual experience when you\u2019re dealing with real, very serious issues. But still, I was amazed at how much energy I had, now much clarity of thought. I hope, that as you do with your life and inspire me to do with mine, is that people just try stuff. Don\u2019t put such a level on that if it\u2019s noon and you\u2019re fasting and you suddenly start eating, don\u2019t hate yourself. But I think it\u2019s the kind of stuff we should do is we should experiment. What\u2019s Gandhi\u2019s autobiography? What is it? The title of it is My Experiments with Truth. I think we all should take things, not just fasting, but I\u2019m a Christian, but so you know what? I\u2019m going to do a little bit to study Islam. I hear all this talk about Islam, let me study it. Just doing little experiments in your life to learn, to grow, to help understand. I think it\u2019s just an incredible way to learn. And actually, at the other end of experiments that I do with my life, I always find myself better and more enriched. Tim Ferriss: Let me jump in for one second because I want to underscore what you just said. Those experiments can take many different forms. So it could be a three-month experiment with vegetarianism. It could be a one-day experiment with fasting. And obviously, folks listening, I am not a doctor. Neither of are doctors and don\u2019t play doctors on the internet. Talk to your medical professional. But all of that said, experiments can also take the form, and I do this a lot when I journal, of thought experiments. One of the more productive brainstorming session that I observed recently was about a group of 15. The moderator started, because there were a lot of heated topics that were going to come up, political or otherwise. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s start with everyone, each person, we\u2019ll go around the room, thinking of one of their most deeply held beliefs, taking the opposite viewpoint and then justifying it or explaining why it\u2019s correct.\u201d So assuming, taking one of your deepest held beliefs, taking the opposite, and then actually giving a compelling argument. This is something that I believe has the nickname \u201csteel manning,\u201d as opposed to \u201cstraw manning.\u201d Darwin actually did this in Origin of Species. To prepare for the onslaught of criticism that he would receive, he predicted and pre-empted many of the positions that his critics would take. He did not dismiss them. He actually made them the strongest versions of those criticisms that he could and then addressed them in the book so that he would be prepared. That was one of the experiments that I most enjoyed observing as a moderator to set the tone, which I thought was really productive. Cory Booker: Again, you can\u2019t interview all the great people on this podcast because many of them have died, but many of them left clues for how they experimented. Like Ben Franklin, he didn\u2019t mean to write his autobiography. He wanted to write a note to his family about what he\u2019d learned in his experiments. He would take one theme. Just imagine if we all said, okay, today I\u2019m going to look at the idea of gratitude and figure it out through this experiment. Mark Zuckerberg said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to have a year where every day I say thank you to somebody and write those notes.\u201d These are glorious sort of journeys or odysseys to see where it leads you and it doesn\u2019t always do it. You\u2019re right, they can be just one moment. You know what, Sunday is my day of faith and I\u2019m going to honor God by not going to the church I go to all the time. Maybe I\u2019m going to go down into Camden, New Jersey and go to a black church or maybe I\u2019m going to go to a Latino church. Or let\u2019s think crazy. Maybe I\u2019m going to go a mosque or a synagogue just to experience that and meet different people. We get caught in these grooves and we\u2019re playing the same record over and over again. Just doing one thing differently, we may not like it, but it actually is going to stretch and broaden us and actually change our, as you know, I know you\u2019ve studied a lot about brains and how we work, just by changing the synapsis of that normal routine, even something as simple as you and I have read about, don\u2019t drive the same way to work every day. There are collateral benefits that brain scientists will say to you that benefit your life in other ways. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. I\u2019m not going to forget about this hunger strike. We\u2019re getting to it, folks. But we might end up in a more interesting place by taking some detours. By the name Phil Zimbardo came up before we started recording. For those people who don\u2019t know, he was one of the lead investigator, if not the designer of the protocol, the Stanford Prison experiment. Cory Booker: Which is profound. Tim Ferriss: Which is profound, and many experiments afterward that showed how you could influence good people to behave in evil ways or neutral people to behave in evil ways. There are some really interesting studies that have looked at so-called Good Samaritans and how you can impact their behavior based on a feeling of urgency and so on. But the point I was going to make is that he encourages people to do what he calls the \u201cdeviant for a day\u201d experiment. It\u2019s, in effect, doing something that is so out of character or so socially odd that people might criticize you or at least look at you in an unusual way. The example he gave was encouraging his students to put, much like Ash Wednesday, where people will put ash on the forehead. But put a mark on your forehead and walk around all day and even if people try to take it off of your forehead, which they probably will, refuse to do that and keep it on. Just so you become more comfortable with discomfort. That could though, deviant for a day, could take the form of say going to a church you would never think of going to. Or changing your routine in such a way that maybe \u2013 I met someone recently who took, and this can be a complicated subject, but he routinely does not give money to homeless people, but will invite them to dinner and have an entire dinner with homeless people. He\u2019s done this, I want to say half a dozen to a dozen times. Let\u2019s just say hypothetically that you earmarked \u2013 for me it\u2019s usually Saturday that I do these experiments. I met someone, a technologist, recently who\u2019s decided that even though he\u2019s not particularly religious, he is Jewish, but he\u2019s going to observe the Shabbat and from, I think it\u2019s sundown to sundown, for one day a week on the weekend. He is not going to use any technology whatsoever because he realizes how dependent he has become and how distracted he\u2019s become based on that. Hunger strike. I promised \u2013 Cory Booker: Hold on. I just \u2013 because the problem with you is you give these \u2013 well, first of all, when you talk about Stoicism and this idea of dressing for one day in rags. There\u2019s such a power of teaching ourselves to be more empathetic to people who might have different experiences. I was a Stanford student who did graduate work in sociology. Just watching actual experiments, not experimenting myself. There was an experiment, I think you can still get the video of it, where you have rooms full of different people that all sit in one cohort \u2013 a bunch of guys. And you put two or three women in there and just watch how many times a woman tries to speak and gets cut off versus the men in the room, when they try to speak. It made me, even if you do 50/50 in the room, it just made me suddenly wake up and start looking for that pattern in my own conversations that I had in life. It was a really mind-blowing experience for me. Another experiment we did where we were the experiments in the room where we all had to reach into a bag and we pulled out a chip and the chip was yellow, blue or red, let\u2019s say. It decided the station we had in this game. Whether you were the upper class, middle class or lower class in this game. The rules of the upper class were great. They really benefitted us. So we knew what the game was. Okay, this is like class society. But we quickly, in the upper class, made laws that protected us. And the lower class people, but what was interesting about the game more than that was that groups were sat in different areas and the animosities amongst players that began. The anger and the defensiveness and the shouting. It descended into a very bad place. To the point at the end of the experiment, they said, I want everybody to take their chips, throw them on the ground, and stamp on them. They had us do a bunch of exercises to get that \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Purge. Cory Booker: Purge you. Just like Zimbardo\u2019s prison experiment, as well as this, I think the game was called Star Power or something like that. How quickly we fall into these roles. So for me, I had this one experience where I went from living in affluent suburbia to living in a housing project. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain to people what the catalyst for that was? Cory Booker: It was the parents I described to you. I was really affected when I was at Stanford by working in East Palo Alto. It was literally \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The contrast is just incredible. Cory Booker: For me, just literally, you cross these tracks into East Palo Alto. Especially at that time. Now you\u2019ve got a Four Seasons or whatever there. It\u2019s gentrified in some ways. But for me, I needed to get my haircut as a black guy. There\u2019s no place on Stanford\u2019s campus that\u2019s used to cutting black hair. So my first time was just going to find a barber back when I had hair. Tim Ferriss: You and me both. Cory Booker: Yeah, but then the summer of my freshman year, I started working a place called the Onetta Harris Community Center, which is technically East Menlo Park. But it was a similar community. I found such a connection with these kids. I basically said, \u201cOkay, this is my life work. I want to work in cities.\u201d So I worked everywhere from East Harlem to East Palo Alto. When I was at Yale, helping to run legal clinics. I just felt a kinship and connection with what I thought my soul mission was, which was \u2013 when I say these words \u201cliberty and justice for all,\u201d \u2013 I always say to people, before you tell me about your religion, first show it to me in how you treat other people. Well, our civic gospel in this country, we all know the words to the Declaration of Independence, or at least we all know a lot of those words. We know the words to our Pledge. We know the National Anthem. But those words actually have power and meaning. It\u2019s just like a religious text that we read and then we go out on Sunday and cut a driver off and flip him off or are we living with grace that Christ, or whatever your religion is, commands? I think we have a civic gospel as well. We are pledging allegiance to the idea of liberty and justice for all. But most Americans don\u2019t know that we have a justice, that by its definition, treats you better if you\u2019re rich and guilty rather than poor and innocent. Because if you and I get arrested for the exact same crime, I\u2019m wealthier than you, you\u2019re a poor white guy from wherever you\u2019re from. I can get out. I can bail myself out, but you\u2019re stuck in the jail sometimes for months. People don\u2019t realize this. Some people stay for months. So if you really believe in that idea of liberty and justice for all, what did you do today to live that to the gospel? So for me, and again, this is just for my own path. What I saw was that I so benefitted from this country. I didn\u2019t have \u2013 you interviewed people in the military. Which you and I are both wired this way that we see people in uniform and are just very drawn to them. When you meet some of the guys you\u2019ve interviewed and see what they\u2019ve gone through and see what they\u2019ve done for this country, they have a level of sort of patriotic ideal that is lived in a way that I revere. But I also have that same thing for people that take themselves out of their privilege and say, you know what? I believe those words that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere and I\u2019m going to do whatever I can to commit myself. You and I both have friends at Teach for America. You know what? I\u2019m going to go off and make a lot of money, but for two years of my life, I\u2019m going to do the Peace Corps. I going to do TFA. I\u2019m going to do something. Anyway, I had all these ideals. I think the challenge in all of us in our life is to try to live lives of the best integrity we can when we live in accordance to our ideals. Lo and behold, though, Newark, New Jersey flipped the script on me and basically said to me, you think you\u2019re here to serve. I was 26 or 27 at the time. You think you\u2019re coming here to serve, you think you\u2019re coming here to help, we\u2019re going to flip the script on you. I always say I got my B.A. from Stanford but my Ph.D. on the streets of Newark. This actually leads me to the hunger strike, where I decided that I was going to move into the toughest area, literally as I\u2019m moving in. Tim Ferriss: Was this before or after the City Council? Cory Booker: No, I\u2019m a Yale Law student at the time. Tim Ferriss: Oh, this is Yale Law School, got it. Cory Booker: Yeah, I was a Yale Law student. Again, I\u2019d worked one summer in East Harlem. I\u2019m very much engaged in what I think are some of the frontiers of our democracy, but I\u2019d never really been a part of the community. A lot of us \u2013 I would volunteer then I\u2019d go back to my dorm at Yale. I just said, you know what? I want to live my life. I want my professional life to be a part of a community. Here I am, I\u2019m a United States Senator and I have the privilege of going back to one of the wealthiest community of all the Senators to go back to. The median income is $14,000 per individual, but I live in a community that blows me away. Every day, I see Americans with a fealty to the ideals of this country literally in the grass roots or in the trenches of our fight for our democracy every single day. I love when reporters or whoever wants to come, walk around my neighborhood and see great people who often are stereotyped or misunderstood because we wall ourselves in America. We often don\u2019t cross these lines, unfortunately in our society. Long story short, I move onto the south end of Martin Luther King Boulevard in Newark. Literally as I\u2019m moving in, my big Italian best friend from fourth grade, a guy named Chris Magaro, was helping me carry stuff in. We come back to the car and my stuff is stolen. Tim Ferriss: Welcome to the neighborhood. Cory Booker: Yeah, welcome to the neighborhood. Unbeknownst to me, but the abandoned home \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say this, I did actually know this at the time, but the abandoned home next to me is where you see, again, a real great cross-section of American life because drug addiction knows no race or socioeconomic status boundaries, so people are coming into this community to buy drugs. I didn\u2019t realize \u2013 I\u2019ve now learned a lot more about the drug market, even than when I was Mayor, because I went back to write a lot about this for my book. I went back and interviewed drug dealers from the \u201890s. But this was a hot place to sell drugs because one guy who was probably a guy that should\u2019ve been in corporate America. He ran the drug operation in Newark, just found a way to get cheap, high-quality product. So I had moved into the middle of this not realizing that I was in probably one of the most violent drug markets. I knew it was bad, but I didn\u2019t know it was as bad as it was. When I went in and I actually interviewed this guy and some of the drug dealers, they had set things up in a way that I was with a person who was helping me record a lot of the interviews. This is sounding like New Jack City. So I\u2019m in the middle of this. I go with this arrogance to the tenant leader. I\u2019m now living in the neighborhood. I\u2019m thinking, ha ha, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m riding in on my white horse, da, da, da. Newark is this amazing city that doesn\u2019t deal well with people \u2013 at least the attitude that I had at that point because Ms. Virginia Jones, the tenant president, looks at me when I\u2019m telling her how much I\u2019m going to help her. She looks at me with this cynical, almost just like, I don\u2019t have time for this look. She did this experiment with me where she takes me down to the middle of Martin Luther King Boulevard. Again, I\u2019m this Yale Law student, I\u2019m here to help you. She goes, \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d I go, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She goes, \u201cWhat do you see in this neighborhood?\u201d I just describe it just the way I did to you, \u201cCrack house and drug operation.\u201d I described the neighborhood. She just looks angry and she says, \u201cYou can\u2019t help me.\u201d She starts walking away. I run after her. I grab this woman from behind, very respectfully. I say to her, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d She says to me words that changed my life. She says to me, \u201cBoy, you need to understand something. The world you see outside of you is a reflection of what you have inside of you. If you\u2019re one of these people who only sees darkness and despair, that\u2019s all there\u2019s ever going to be. But if you\u2019re one of those stubborn people who every time you open your eyes, you see hope, opportunity, love, if you see the face of God, then you can be somebody who helps me.\u201d And she leaves me there sort of looking at my feet, thinking to myself, \u201cOkay, Grasshopper, thus endeth the lesson.\u201d I went back and I just was like, okay, \u201cI\u2019m here to learn. I\u2019m not here to help. I\u2019m here to learn.\u201d I sat on this woman\u2019s couch and watched what I just was in awe of. People would come to see her with problems. She would help people with rent, somebody needed a job. She held this community \u2013 her son in the \u201880s, before I arrived, was murdered in the lobby of the building that I lived in, that I eventually would live in. She and I were probably two of the people that were some of the highest income earners in there. We could\u2019ve lived anywhere. But she, literally after her son was murdered, stayed in those buildings, remained the tenant president, held that community together with the force of her will. Both buildings \u2013 I live in the neighborhood still, but those buildings aren\u2019t there anymore. They still have a reunion every year. Think about this. These were buildings when I lived in them for eight years, heat and hot water irregular, homeless people or worse, sometimes collapsed. I\u2019d walk past people in the stairwells when the elevators weren\u2019t working wondering occasionally if someone was alive or not, trying to nudge them. You\u2019d see feces in the hallways, mice. I could tell you all the challenges of living in these buildings, but yet there was such a sense of community created there that still years later, the buildings are gone, and there\u2019s still a reunion being held. The alumni from those buildings, because of the spirit in that community, go on to do incredible things. I give, like I\u2019m sure you do, try to write checks at the end of the year to people who are doing great things. One of them is a guy, a police officer from those buildings, who grew up in those buildings, who still does things. I had gone into politics because \u2013 okay, so fast forward. Me and Ms. Jones and other tenant leaders are taking on the slumlord who eventually got convicted in federal court, fighting noble battles. But the residents in that building and a number of others are really frustrated that they don\u2019t think the City is being responsive to their concerns and needs. There\u2019s talk about running somebody for City Council. It\u2019s one of those times where you\u2019re standing in a line, \u201cWho volunteers?\u201d and everybody steps backwards and you\u2019re the person. Before you know it, I\u2019m the candidate. I won the central ward of Newark. Which if you go visit me in my Senate office, that\u2019s the map behind me that still sits there. Who got me into politics. This place with an abundance of public housing, overwhelmingly black and Latino. Folks who put their faith in me before they even knew me. This was about a year after I moved into the neighborhood. Before I was even a known commodity, they said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a risk on you.\u201d The reason why the hunger strike ended up is because I get elected and a year later, I am at the nadir, the lowest point of my professional life where I felt like a failure. I wasn\u2019t getting anything done. The Mayor of the City, who was like, if I\u2019m just a novice in politics, if this is like my freshman year of high school as a first-year City Councilperson, Sharpe James \u2013 and anybody will tell you this in New Jersey \u2013 he was the grand master. I was a Paduan Jedi; he was a Jedi \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Darth Vader. Cory Booker: Depending on your perspective. Let\u2019s give love to people. But he was a Jedi knight. Again, we\u2019re laughing and people here might not know it, but this period of my life was a documentary called \u201cStreet Fight.\u201d It got nominated for an Academy Award. It won the Tribeca Film Festival for audience choice. I always say ignominiously, now as a vegan, it lost to a movie called \u201cMarch of the Penguins.\u201d So I always say I make an exception for penguin meat when I\u2019m eating. But this was an interesting moment. Tim Ferriss: Feathered sausages, as they\u2019re known. Cory Booker: As they\u2019re known. You and I are going to get letters from The Humane Society. Tim Ferriss: You guys can all mail those to Brian Callan, the comedian. He\u2019s the one that came up with it. Cory Booker: My first year, basically Sharpe James is toying with me. The headlines are still there because I pulled them to write this book, so I want to show people I\u2019m not making this up. I was getting my car ticketed everywhere, when I parked in front of City Hall with the other Council people. My phones were tapped. This is something that sounds almost funny two decades later, but my phones were tapped. I wasn\u2019t getting anything passed. My own community was getting frustrated with me because we put all this effort into getting you elected. So I\u2019m ready to quit. I was more effective as a young, tenants\u2019 rights lawyer than I have been in elected office. On my lowest day, one year later, the summer of 1999 \u2013 I\u2019d been elected in \u201998 \u2013 I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end. I\u2019d gained weight. I go to bed most nights with pounding headaches. I\u2019m stressed out of my gourd. I feel like \u2013 people were warming me that the police were following me. I think the Mayor might have seen me as a future threat. Which was prescient for him. So people warning me that the police are following me. I\u2019m just scared. I\u2019m feeling like a failure as a guy who so much of my life has been afraid of failure and now in the first steps of my professional career I\u2019m failing. On the lowest day, when I\u2019m getting outvoted all the time on the City Council for my great, brilliant ideas that people are supposed to bow down before. I\u2019m being a jerk because it\u2019s one of the moments I admitted I was a self-righteous jerk to my fellow City Council people. I\u2019m supposed to find common ground with the past stuff. So I\u2019m making all these mistakes. I get a call from a tenant leader named Elaine Sewell at these other high-rise, low-income housing and she basically says to me, \u201cIt\u2019s off the hook up here.\u201d I still remember the movie that summer was Wild, Wild West. She\u2019s like it\u2019s the Wild, Wild West out here. There was a horrible incident where security guards were attacked by some of the drug dealers in this open-air drug market underneath a \u2013 these buildings sat by Highway 280 in New Jersey. So it\u2019s a place people drive by but never slow down to look, except to buy drugs, because it looked like a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru. People would line up to buy their drugs. So the drug dealers controlled this area. The security guards were undermining that. They tried to light the guard booth on fire. She\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d I\u2019m basically like, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything.\u201d I just professed impotency. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t get anything done. What do you expect me to do?\u201d She and I start yelling. I\u2019m like, \u201cI can\u2019t even get the cops to stop ticketing my car. How am I going to get them to come out there?\u201d She basically says to me like the worst thing she could to me. This is not because of her, but it\u2019s just because I had a wound. She\u2019s like, \u201cWhy did we elect you then at all if you can\u2019t do anything?\u201d I was done. I lose my temper, raise my voice, hang up on her and now I storm home. You don\u2019t have this problem, but I do. It\u2019s one of my addictions. All I want to do is get back to my apartment in Brick Towers and hang out with my two buddies, Ben & Jerry and just eat myself into a food coma and go to bed. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I\u2019m familiar with the cookie dough mixture. Self-medication. Cory Booker: Yes. And so but unfortunately, I\u2019m walking past to get to my apartment, this woman, Ms. Virginia Jones. This pain in my neck. This righteous pain in my neck. The tenant leader, who happens to be standing out in the courtyard. I literally as I see her, I\u2019m not in the mood for you, Ms. Jones. I need to get back to my apartment and eat my dag-nab cookie dough ice cream, because they combined the two now. As I try to walk past her grunting her hello like a falcon would like a mouse, she starts playing with me. She says, \u201cDon\u2019t walk past me.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy?\u201d I turn around and stop. She read me right away and she\u2019s like, \u201cCome here and give Ms. Jones a hug.\u201d I walk over and I give her the most insincere hug in the world. Like when you say you\u2019re still going to be friends with somebody after you break up with them. It\u2019s just like yeah, yeah, yeah. I try to turn around and she grabs me by the arm and she goes, \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d I just got like angry. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou want to know what\u2019s wrong? YOU want to know what\u2019s wrong?\u201d And I vented on her, probably blaming her a little. \u201cThis is not working. I\u2019m in this office. I\u2019m not getting anything done.\u201d It was like the cry me a river, woe is me speech. Then I ended with what\u2019s happening to Elaine Sewell in Garden Spires and literally said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I must have repeated \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do\u201d like three times. Finally, she looked like a lightning bolt had hit her. She suddenly gets really excited. She goes, \u201cOh, my gosh!\u201d I stop like she erased my script and my pity party. She\u2019s like, \u201cI know what you should do!\u201d I\u2019m like you know what? This is a wise woman. Occasionally she pulls some amazing gem out. I\u2019m thinking maybe she has hope for me. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d She goes, \u201cI know exactly what you should do.\u201d I go, \u201cI heard you. What should I do?\u201d And then she repeats it. \u201cYep, I know what you should do.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cMs. Jones, I don\u2019t have time to play.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Enough foreplay, what\u2019s the plan? Cory Booker: Yeah, so what\u2019s the plan? And she looks at me, she leans in and she goes, \u201cYou should do,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She goes, \u201cYou should do something.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d And if my Momma didn\u2019t raise me right, I probably would have said some wrong things to her. I storm off to my building, elevator\u2019s not fricking working. I climb 16 flights of stairs. Practically kick open my door. Plop down on my couch. And if you walk into my office today, I still have the Bhagava Gita, the Koran, the Torah, the Bible. The Bible\u2019s sitting next to me in my apartment. I open it up and there\u2019s this passage that most Christians know called \u201cIf you have faith the size of a mustard size, you can move mountains.\u201d But the next passage, which I didn\u2019t know well at that point, says \u201cSometimes you have to fast and pray.\u201d I just thought to myself, you know what, I had not. I was too caught up in my drama, too caught up in my script, that I hadn\u2019t sort of surrendered myself with an open heart. I decided I was going to fast. Then the ideas started flowing. I could do something. I said, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m not just going to fast, I\u2019m going to plop right down in the middle of the drug market and fast. And I\u2019m not going to just fast and pray, I\u2019m going to get a tent.\u201d Before you knew it, my mind just started kickstarting. This is a problem most people don\u2019t understand is that despair or cynicism is the worst. I think cynicism, just like despair, is a toxic spiritual state. It gives you the inability to see faint hope amidst glaring problems. But again, I\u2019m a person of faith. I believe that we were made in the image of a creator and therefore one of our greatest gifts is to be creative. To think of new opportunities. But if you\u2019re so negative and so cynical about the world around you, you disempower yourself and not do something about it. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re only going to see the problems and not any of the solutions. Cory Booker: Right. And you and I have both had conversations with somebody that\u2019s in that state. They say they want help, but every time you bring up an idea, they just shoot it down. Because they\u2019re not open to the possibilities. So long story short is go out there to Garden Spires. We set up a big tent. I apologize to Elaine Sewell. Literally, there might have been some hugging and crying between the two of us because we were such close friends. I wouldn\u2019t have gotten elected without her. Then I do what politicians love doing \u2013 I called a press conference. I just said, \u201cThis is the United States of America. People shouldn\u2019t live in fear.\u201d I announced that I was going to stay on this pavement and fast as long as it took for something to change. I invited people to pray with me. First day, there were four of us praying and everything. Then I went to bed. The first night was scary. Courageous people slept with me underneath it, in this, what used to be the drug dealers\u2019 territory. People threw diapers on top of us. It was a scary night. But I woke up the next morning, and a bunch of correctional officers were there. They said, hey, we saw you on the news. You\u2019re not staying out here alone. Over ten days, the world came out. There were community leaders. Newark has such a reservoir of strength and love. People poured out. But then people \u2013 a suburban Mayor from West Orange came out with his police officers. Hospitals started coming out and doing health screenings. Employers started coming out doing job fairs. People were donating computers. By the tenth day, the Mayor of the City came out and it was so funny because he came out with prepared remarks. He and I would fight bitterly later, but after ten days of fasting and praying, I looked at him differently. I saw his humanity. I saw that he was a guy. We hugged. I\u2019ll never forget. My editor wanted me to write this part out because I\u2019ll forget. Smell is one of the most powerful triggers to memory. I hugged him and I breathed deep as we were hugging. I smelled him. He smelled like a family member of mine. I was at that point like a 30-year-old. He was my father\u2019s age. When I smelled him, it felt like older uncles and things like that. We parted from our embrace, which became the front page of this section of the newspaper. He put away his prepared remarks and turned and gave an incredible speech. He made promises that he ultimately \u2013 like he was going to build a part in the area. That stuff never happened. But it was a beautiful moment. The tent came down. I always say that change never happens in an instant. You know this even in your own life, changing your own life. It\u2019s something you have to keep at and work at. So the world didn\u2019t change. But I always tell people, for me, it was one of the most powerful moments of my life. Because the problems at Garden Spires didn\u2019t go away. It was something I worked on until eventually I became the Mayor, built a park in the area and all this stuff. The point I always try to tell people is the most powerful moment of the whole experience to me was the last prayer, where there were now from four or five people praying and shaking on the first day, now there were 100, 200 people. There was everybody there. I looked and said, \u201cThis is my America.\u201d There were white folks, black folks, Latino folks, Asian folks. There were Imams, Rabbis, priests, ministers, young, old. People when they started praying were praying in Hebrew and Arabic and Spanish. I was the weakest I\u2019d ever been after ten days of not eating, but you know this from fasting. But I think it was also the circle. I just felt such strength, such power, such energy like I\u2019d never felt before. I felt like I was connecting to who we are as a country, that ideal of e pluribus unum, that when we all come together, nothing is impossible. It was the most hopeful moment of my life at that point. It also gave me a renewed sense of mission. That if I could find ways with others to bring people together, we could blow away problems in this country and everybody could benefit. Tim Ferriss: I want to ask what you learned from that, because it seems to me, and I don\u2019t like when people put words in my mouth, so I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but that you found an option when you thought there were no options, right? Cory Booker: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d love to know what you learned from that and how it impacted maybe later decisions. Maybe I\u2019m making it too complicated. What did you learn? Because to me, there are a couple takeaways. I\u2019m taking notes, for those people who can\u2019t see me because you can\u2019t, it\u2019s audio. I constantly take notes. I\u2019m circling things, I\u2019m highlighting things. That you also forced the Mayor to respond. Cory Booker: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Because you were calling attention to something. So if you couldn\u2019t go through official channels, you could use the court of public opinion to force his hand to respond, right? Cory Booker: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I would just love to know what you learned from that experience that maybe became part of your repertoire or set of options later. Cory Booker: Well, so this was my first experience with lessons that people have learned a lot through activism experience. If you can bring attention to a problem \u2013 look, when Martin Luther King and James Bevel and Dorothy Cotton were fighting Bull Connor, if they had tried to fight that battle alone, who knows what the outcome would\u2019ve been. But he had the fire hoses, he had the dogs and all of that. But by their ability to bring attention to the problem. After their demonstrations, the story went viral back in the day where you didn\u2019t have social media, but you had the traditional media. Suddenly the Soviet Union is mocking our democracy because watching black kids get bit by dogs, people in Iowa sitting there having their dinner and saying, oh, my gosh, look at the humanity of us all. We all love each other or have reservoirs of love for each other that once we trigger each other\u2019s consciousness or expand each other\u2019s moral imagination, let\u2019s just say that, it activates us. Clearly, in New Jersey, we set up this society unfortunately. A lot of this was very bad policy, some of the very bigoted policy of redlining and decisions by the federal housing organizations to pack all this poverty in one area. Tim Ferriss: What is redlining? Cory Booker: Redlining is where \u2013 it comes from literally what they did on maps. They said okay, this is a black area and we\u2019re not going to give mortgages and loans to people. We\u2019re going to devalue the neighborhoods there. Decisions made about zoning where we\u2019re going to let certain people live. So you see some of these maps that are still around. This is part of our history where at a time when people were starting to flee urban areas, it was a federal policy that enabled certain people to move out and get good value for their homes and the like, certain people not. It was put on top of that were everything from restrictive covenants to real estate steering, which my family did. Think about this, and New Jersey is a great example, as lots of states are. If they decided instead of putting a whole bunch of public housing in one area, like thousands and thousands of units, what if we took every unit like at Harrington Park, you take four units of affordable housing. We now know that poor kids, same poverty, poor kids in middleclass neighborhoods do so much better than when you concentrate all poor kids in poor neighborhoods. And by the way, these were overt policies. These were like, we cannot let black people out of neighborhoods. What are we going to do to keep them in? And so that created these ghettos that then became \u2013 well, where did the jobs go to? They went outside of the communities. Where are the good schools? Because, remember, if everybody leaves the city, their ability to have a tax base to support the education system is not there. And by the way, the tax base has now disappeared. You can\u2019t even support police officers or everything so cities start tumbling downward. Then you create laws to keep people back. I was shocked when I got to Newark that surrounding suburbs with really great schools would actually hire people, private investigators, to say okay, there\u2019s a black kid going to these schools, let\u2019s follow them around to see where they go home to. In fact, there\u2019s a woman, I just saw her again, last name Martinez, who was a writer for the Wall Street Journal education page. Her family used a fake address in a different neighborhood to get her kid to school. They were caught. She was pulled out of, ironically, a journalism class, and forced to go back. It was a horrible situation. A lot of people don\u2019t realize that a lot of these problems that exist today are not legacies to slavery. These are legacies to the \u201850s, \u201860s, \u201870s, and \u201880s. But they forget the other story of America, which is literally the creation of toxic zones in our nation. So people don\u2019t understand. When they flee these cities, corporate America was allowed for years to pollute those cities pretty badly. In Newark, I used to remind people, literally pollute. Now you\u2019re a kid growing up in an environment where you\u2019ve got lead paint, and we have epidemic levels in Newark. You and I both know, you don\u2019t even need to be lead poisoned, just elevated blood lead levels affect your brain where your executive function deteriorates. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, your oxygen carrying capacity and all of that. Cory Booker: All of that. But it\u2019s not just the lead paint. The air \u2013 because now you\u2019ve created cities again, where did we choose to build highways and roads that the oxygen is so bad that you have asthma levels that are three and four times as high in urban areas? It\u2019s not even done yet. I remember when I wanted to try to get rid of the food deserts in Newark; big campaign. I just finally got a Whole Foods that we just opened. We got supermarkets. But we also said let\u2019s create urban agriculture. We\u2019re going to create acres and acres of farms in Newark, which we did successfully and have guys coming home from prison, men and women coming home from prison, jobs. But we also said, wait a minute, we want to dig in the ground. The state said, you can\u2019t dig in the soil. It\u2019s got too much lead. Imagine this now. Your air quality, your soil quality. What about the river that 100 years ago immigrants from Ireland and you pick an area. If you were poor, you could still go into the river and it was a commons, right? You could get fish. We had lots of clams and the like. But now it is \u2013 I\u2019m not exaggerating this \u2013 it is literally a superfund poisoned with Agent Orange, all kinds of other dioxides from years of corporations despoiling the river. Literally stealing from future residents of Newark and calling it profits in their present. Imagine this, you\u2019ve got schools that have deteriorated. You\u2019ve got a physical environment that\u2019s toxic. You have large concentrations of poverty and then you have something on top of that, which most Americans don\u2019t realize, which I mentioned earlier, but let\u2019s just understand it, called the criminal justice system. This is why I love from the Coke Brothers, to the Heritage Foundation on the right, to Democrats like me, all agree because of this reality that I now know from my own experiences. My friends in Harrington Park, New Jersey and Old Tappan High School I went to \u2013 I hope they don\u2019t get mad at me for saying this \u2013 but we broke a lot of laws. Drug laws, friends of mine on senior cut day kicked open a liquor store that was closed. They couldn\u2019t use their fake IDs, so they stole cases of beer and got caught. That\u2019s breaking and entering. That\u2019s a felony. Very little consequence, besides our parents and others maybe getting upset. But my friends and I have all gone one with our lives, raising families. Very different justice system for doing the exact same things to experience in many places in our community. Our criminal justice system is now overly targeted towards poor people. At Stanford, at Princeton, nobody was getting stopped and frisked coming home. By the way, if they did from a frat party, they would find drugs. No FBI operation right now saying how are we going to get those college kids and break their drug ring? When I know on college campuses, from Adderall to X, you can get them, sometimes on a smartphone. But in the inner city, those things become literally the difference between you making in life and you don\u2019t. And in a nation where almost one in three adults now has an arrest record, for you and I right now, if we get arrested, we have the means with which it\u2019s not going to change our lives. It might change my politics, but it won\u2019t change our lives. The problem with inner cities, and I saw this when I went out to Riker\u2019s Island, if you get arrested, you can\u2019t even afford the bail. I was out in Riker\u2019s and these were kids missing six months to a year before they\u2019re even adjudicated. There is a documentary Jay Z just did about Kalief Browder, who spent two years-plus in jail for stealing a backpack. Most people don\u2019t realize in jail what we do to kids. Other countries call it torture, which is solitary confinement. Talk about life experiments. We\u2019ve heard about this. There\u2019s a great guy you should interview who wrote an amazing book about what he did with trying to cope with being stuck in solitary. But psychologists now conclude \u2013 in fact, over 50 percent of the suicides of juveniles in prisons are kids that were in solitary confinement. Over 60 percent, if you include kids that just got out of solitary confinement. So now you have a criminal justice system that preys upon the poor. And by the way, you and I are both guys of means, but in America right now, there\u2019s no difference \u2013 drug dealing and drug usage is sort of equal amongst races in America. In fact, young white men have a little higher levels according to some studies, of dealing drugs. But if you\u2019re black in America, you\u2019re going to be arrested for that usage 3.7 times more likely than someone who is white. So now you get these poor areas, toxic physical environment, designed to be poor because of the compacting and public housing in those certain areas. Now you get a criminal justice system that is focused on them, not in my town where I grew up. By the way, most Americans don\u2019t know that if you get arrested in America, most states can legally discriminate against you. I can deny you a job just because you have an arrest, even if you were cleared of the charges. Most people don\u2019t realize that FBI records are so bad that a large percentage of the FBI background checks come back wrong. I think the majority of them come back wrong. So you may have been cleared of your charges, but that employer, you don\u2019t even know they\u2019re looking at it, thinks you still had something wrong. But the American Bar Association identified 40,000 collateral consequences if you have been convicted of a non-violent drug offense. Remember, two of the three last Presidents, felony drug use they copped to, not just some pot, Obama and Bush \u2013 felony drug use. There are Presidents, a lot of Congress people the same. But if you\u2019re a kid in Newark who got caught for a non-violent drug offense doing something stupid that we did, that Stanford students and Princeton students are doing, they can\u2019t get a Pell grant, they can\u2019t get food stamps, they can\u2019t get business licenses. I had a guy begging me when I was Mayor of Newark, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get a cab license? It was 18 years ago and I was just caught with a little bit of drugs.\u201d You can\u2019t get a job at Burger King in Newark. I say all this \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Mind if I jump in? Oh no, go ahead. Cory Booker: The conclusion of all this is that\u2019s sort of what got me into fighting against a lot of stuff and finding like the concrete of Garden Spires where I did the hunger strike, learning that if I try to fight these battles without creating unusual coalitions \u2013 basically if I can create unusual coalitions, I can get unusual results. If I can awaken people to the facts of what\u2019s going on, if I can appeal to people\u2019s moral imagination, I can tap into a tremendous amount of energy. For Newark, I had to hack the system. In many ways, what I did with the hunger strike taught me that if I can think of ways to hack the system and get people to pay attention that weren\u2019t paying attention before, I can actually make tremendous things happen very quickly. I became Mayor at the worst time to be a mayor of an American city, during the Great Recession, which is a Great Depression. I had a guy who was my friend, and I know I say that and some of my Democrat friends get mad at me, but Chris Christie is my friend. I can write a dissertation on our disagreements, but I said, \u201cI\u2019m the Mayor of the largest city. You\u2019re the Governor of the biggest state. Let\u2019s not focus on where we disagree. Let\u2019s see if we can find some things we can work together on because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just going to be screaming at you from the outside, as opposed to sitting at the table with you and finding things that at least two Americans can find six or seven things that we can work together on.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Just to pause \u2013 everybody should rewind that and listen to the exact wording of that five to ten times because it\u2019s useful. Cory Booker: My funniest Chris Christie story is \u2013 not funniest, but most instructive to me \u2013 was when the press got mad at me. It was marriage equality. Gay marriage was being voted on. Something I\u2019m strident about; equal justice under the law. Chris Christie is stridently against. It\u2019s being voted on in the State Senate in New Jersey. I had a meeting \u2013 I didn\u2019t plan it this way, but it was scheduled with Chris Christie in Trenton in his office on the same day that all this was happening. Imagine this \u2013 protestors outside, media outside. I\u2019m going in to meet with Chris Christie and everybody\u2019s thinking the first person who ever raised the pride flag in front of City Hall in Newark, the guy that refused to perform marriages when I was Mayor because I\u2019m not going to marry anybody unless I can marry everybody, I\u2019m marching in to meet with Chris Christie and everybody\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s going in there to give Chris Christie hell.\u201d Really I\u2019m marching in there with him because I was working on a $300 million project in downtown Newark that had places for schools, and that had affordable housing. I brought together an unusual coalition. Unions pledging to do apprenticeship programs for my kids, Goldman Sachs (God forbid) because they were one of the few that I could get to get capital for the project. It was an amazing coalition to benefit my city, to create jobs and the like and he\u2019s critical to getting it done, so I\u2019m going in to meet with him. I come out and the press it putting microphones in my face. \u201cDid you give it to him on this?\u201d I\u2019m like, I could have sat there for my entire one hour I had with the Governor of the State of New Jersey and fought with him and we would\u2019ve changed neither of each other\u2019s minds. But by focusing on something \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s not a time and place. Chris Christie has not been soft on me on things he disagrees with. He publicly criticizes me. Even when I\u2019m Senator, he still publicly criticizes me on things. I haven\u2019t been soft on him, but in that precious time I had with him, I wanted to get this dag-nab project done so I could get jobs for people who yesterday or the day before, they needed to go to work and that was what was important. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t interrupt you. Sorry for attempting. Where I was going to go was exactly where you helped me segue, which is something that we chatted about very briefly before recording. Feel free to wordsmith this because I scribbled it down very quickly. But we\u2019re becoming reactivists, not activists. For people who listen, for instance, when you were talking about all of these various problems. There are many people in this country, and certainly around the world, who feel overwhelmed, disempowered, like it\u2019s all just too much that they can\u2019t do anything. Then they become or they take on the cynicism that we already talked about as being very toxic and contagious also. How would you suggest, if people care about a specific issue, they want to do good. But let\u2019s say they have a full-time job. What makes someone a good activist? Cory Booker: Well, great question. I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to approach this. I guess there are two things that are bubbling up in me. The first is again, life lessons that you and I have talked about in our past, but more you\u2019ve talked about. I find that if every day I get up and can focus on and keep clarity on what the mission is. What is my purpose today? Even back to the time, I credit my success in college from failure. Life does this to me a lot. It beats me down to the basic elements of my being. You and I have both probably been through that. Newark did that to me a lot. I think from our brokenness \u2013 it\u2019s also necessary to be broken because that\u2019s often when the light gets in. It\u2019s like when in our shining armor and stuff like that and nothing\u2019s penetrating. But sometimes it takes us getting broken down. My first brokenness in my post-18-year-old life was getting to Stanford as this big hyped football player and failing. Sinking on the depth chart so the coach had to dig a little hole and write my name really low on the ground because that\u2019s how far on the depth chart I was. Just getting into a fight on the football field \u2013 I\u2019m not a fighter. I\u2019m a guy that \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Fight meaning punch, punch? Cory Booker: Oh, my God, yeah. I went at it. I always say this to kids, if you bump into somebody in a hallway and you\u2019re in a great mood, that\u2019s just a bump in the hallway. But sometimes when you have a lot of anger and you bump into somebody, you take all the anger from all other areas of your life and you focus it on the person. I was just feeling like a failure on the football field and anxious and nervous and fearful. Because you get there at Stanford for football, you get there like around August and school doesn\u2019t start at Stanford until like September or October. I\u2019m fearing this reality that the truth is I was not the greatest student, not as great as kids I\u2019m with, these brainiacs. I thought to myself, I\u2019m not competing on the football field and I\u2019m about to go in the classroom and just get my butt kicked by these smart kids from around the globe, who should be Stanford students. I\u2019m an imposter. I got here as an over-hyped football player who\u2019s not good enough to compete in school. I\u2019ll never forget the moment I really was contemplating leaving Stanford before school even began and tucking tail and running. I pulled out of my notebook a piece of paper and just clarified. I basically put values down. Statements of who I am, what I stand for, and what I am trying to achieve. The goals then became, and you can talk to my college roommate, who is still a dear friend. I\u2019d have a whiteboard up, my entire college career. Tim Ferriss: In the dorm room? Cory Booker: In the dorm room. I put it in code because I didn\u2019t want people to know what my goals were. Tim Ferriss: I have to ask \u2013 what would be an examination of a goal? If you don\u2019t remember, you can make something up. Then what would the code say? I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t just like pig Latin or something. Cory Booker: No, the code would be like I really wanted to transform my body. Some of the goals were very specific, like, I\u2019m going to weigh this much, I\u2019m going to run this 40 time, I\u2019m going to bench this much, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to get to these numbers. Academically, it\u2019s the same thing. I\u2019m taking this course load. I\u2019m going to decide beforehand what grade I want to get and what I\u2019m willing to do to get to that grade. What I found in college was this was a liberating experience because I realized if I was willing \u2013 and I have a good book in me. If you ever want to co-write this book, how to get straight A\u2019s in college. How to get straight A\u2019s in college if you\u2019re a dumb person, like I was. Tim Ferriss: Sounds like a winning title. Cory Booker: Because I just realized, you know this, everything\u2019s a hack, right? Everything is the strategy that you have. Forgive me, Maya Angelou; forgive me, Alice Walker. I can\u2019t remember who said it. There\u2019s a curse in it. But I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s Alice Walker. This is the quote: \u201cIf you want to fly, you\u2019ve got to give up the shit that holds you down.\u201d The power of that is that most of us want things, but we\u2019re not willing to give up something to get it. What I learned in college that still serves me now is what am I willing to sacrifice? Am I willing to sacrifice? In college for me, it wasn\u2019t a complicated life. There wasn\u2019t anything I was willing to give up for the two things I wanted to excel in: academics and athletics. Once I realized that and really got it clear, then I could do it. So what happened to me? Why did I become an A student when in high school I was a B student? It\u2019s simple. Because when everybody else on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights were going to parties, I realized if I do what everybody else is doing, I\u2019m going to get the same results. If you want things that other people don\u2019t have, you\u2019ve got to be willing to do the things that other people don\u2019t do. I said I\u2019m going to go to the library for three or four hours. I\u2019ll still go to the party at 11:00 or 12:00, but I\u2019m going to do things that other people aren\u2019t doing and study. I\u2019m going to learn little hacks. If the paper\u2019s due on the 7th, I\u2019m going to find out who\u2019s grading my paper and give them a rough draft on the 1st. But really the 1st I give my best effort. Like this is the best thing I could put together, here. I found out that the TAs would say \u2013 I would say, here\u2019s some of my ideas, can you read this over and tell me if I\u2019m on the right track? They would then tell me the pathway I needed to take to take that B paper to an A paper. I could go through all of the things I did to come out of Stanford and be qualified to get a Rhodes Scholarship. But what I\u2019m saying to you, more importantly, going to this idea of activism, and I do this all the way, especially because in politics there are so many forces trying to erode your moral core. I looked funny at my Chief of Staff because we just went through one of them on drug imports where we got publicly castigated. We ended up getting to where we were in a place in accordance with our values for the right for importation of drugs from Canada. But if I didn\u2019t know my moral core before that, I would have veered way off course. What college did for me was said focus in on what\u2019s important and cut everything else out and then find people who can teach you. What I did there, and the joke I always say is, on the football field, there was a guy named Jeff James, this great wide receiver. I studied him. He didn\u2019t know it, but I watched what he did. I literally would begin copying the way he dressed to go out on the field. Like his towel was a certain way. I used to go back and sulk that I was so low on the depth chart. But I started seeing that the superstars on our team were going to the gym when everybody else was going to the training table. I transformed my body. I made the California All Strength Team by going in and doing all the extra work. In the classroom what I did was just look at who the smart people were. I saw smart people have better habits than me. They sit different places than I used to sit when I was in class. For anything you want to do in life, except for maybe being in politics, which I can talk to you about. It was harder for me then. I always look for a model. What are they doing right? What can I innovate upon that they\u2019re doing so I can find a way to do even better? And then by the way, share with other people your results. Tell them about your story and so on and so forth. Let\u2019s get back to activism right now. One thing I have to get off my shoulders and I don\u2019t want to be a complainer. I know your audience wonderfully is you have Republicans who listen to you and Democrats who listen to you. This is one of the greatest podcasts in America and I\u2019m not just trying to blow your head up. Because one of the few spaces in America where people from different political parties come to listen to the same guy. That\u2019s great that right now \u2013 and there might be some Republicans listening right now that are like, \u201cGod, who\u2019s he got this week? A Democrat. I usually don\u2019t listen to him, but it\u2019s Tim, I\u2019ll give this guy a shot.\u201d So this is a wonderful space that Right and Left are listening to. Let\u2019s just take it from people on my side of the aisle, who are so upset about Trump right now. One of the things that bothers me right now is because we don\u2019t understand that before Trump, right or left, why were we so disturbed before this about the injustices in our country? That Superfund site in Newark? By the way, there are Superfunds in every single state in the nation. Ronald Reagan was one of the last Presidents to re-authorize a cleanup mechanism. Mitch McConnell, the current leader of the Senate, voted for it. It was to take polluting industries and do a teeny, tiny tax. No difference, teeny, tiny tax, to fund Superfund sites. We\u2019re now in a different era. God Bless Ronald Reagan, but a lot of the things he did, we currently don\u2019t necessarily want to do. That has lapsed and nobody is willing to re-authorize it. So what\u2019s happened to Superfunds in America? They\u2019ve gone up. We have more Superfund sites now. They\u2019re increasing. Tim Ferriss: Can you reiterate what a Superfund site is? Cory Booker: I\u2019m sorry. These are sites that are so profoundly toxic and dangerous, even living around them \u2013 Tim Ferriss: And it\u2019s Superfund? Cory Booker: Super, F-U-N-D because we created, as Congress, bipartisan, a fund to clean them up. We said these are so toxic and dangerous, that we are going to take special legislation to clean these up. God Bless Reagan for re-authorizing it, and God Bless Mitch McConnell and others for voting for it. Now it\u2019s lapsed. When I got into Congress, this was a mission for me because New Jersey is the No. 1 state in America for Superfund sites. North to South, and they\u2019re overwhelmingly concentrated in poor areas. Now we have longitudinal data that we know that unfortunately, children who are born around Superfund sites have significantly higher levels of birth defects and autism. This is a threat to American children. It\u2019s been going on. Why aren\u2019t people more activated by that? I\u2019ll give you one more example and this is a controversial example, because we all like our bacon. But North Carolina has 9 million pigs. Why is that an important number? Pigs create ten times the excrement that a human being does. So they\u2019ve got the same population in pigs as New Jersey has people, but ten times the excrement. What do you do with that excrement when you have that kind of factory farming? Well, New Jersey\u2019s human waste, we put it in waste treatment plants. It doesn\u2019t poison us. We don\u2019t get poisoned by our own crap. In North Carolina, unfortunately, a lot of these pig farms are located in very poor, low-lying areas. These people who live in those areas didn\u2019t invite the stuff in. I talked to a Vietnam War veteran who leaves his home to serve in Vietnam, comes back, and there\u2019s one of these places. What they do is they put all the crap into lagoons. Just weeks ago, I went to stand with these people and try to figure out how I can help them. Then they take the excrement and they spray it in the air over what are empty fields. But the problem is \u2013 and I stood there and watched \u2013 is the mist from that stuff floats off the property of the pig farmers. By the way, the pig farmers in many ways don\u2019t even own the pigs. They get these pigs delivered by the larger corporations. They have to raise them for six months and then they get picked up. But long story short, this community has horrific cases of cancers and respiratory diseases. They can\u2019t open their windows. They can\u2019t run their air conditioning. Every time they try to elect somebody that will represent them, the industry, one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington, is Big Ag, these corporate farms, corporate folks, will just put a lot of money behind people that will fight them. I bring this example up because no human being could have gone where I went, Right or Left, sat with these people and see what they\u2019re enduring and their children are enduring, and not been outraged by it. Why, all of a sudden, now that we have a new President \u2013 and I don\u2019t care if it was Obama or whatever. Why have we lost our sense of urgency and our sense of outrage? The last example I\u2019ll give you is a Chris Christie example. I\u2019m glad I said already \u2013 I talked to him a few weeks ago. If you can\u2019t find a way to be a friend with another American, I always say, \u201cPatriotism is love of country. You can\u2019t love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.\u201d Even our founders understood this. A bunch of very different people. At the end of the Declaration of Independence, they call to future generations and say, in order to make this country work, we have to have an irrational commitment to one another that makes even, it\u2019s irrational, it doesn\u2019t even make sense. We\u2019ve got to mutually pledge to each other our lives and our future. I love this last one, our sacred honor. So if you\u2019re one of those people who just because somebody says they\u2019re a liberal, you call them a \u201clibtard,\u201d this is the stuff I read. Or just because someone says they\u2019re a Republican, you call them a \u201cracist,\u201d whatever, whatever, whatever, then you are not honoring the vision that this country was founded upon about the irrational commitment. Tim Ferriss: A team of rivals, right? Yes. Governor Christie, I use him as an example and I apologize if he\u2019s a big listener to this, because I went to go vote in 2008 for Barack Obama in Newark, New Jersey, a majority black city. Let\u2019s just say he was a little popular in Newark. Lines around the polling places. I go vote there. There\u2019s a woman at the end of the line. I\u2019m rolling deep. I\u2019m the Mayor of the City. I\u2019ve got officers next to me. I\u2019m getting out of a fancy SUV. The woman looks at me, as Newarkers do, I love my city. We keep it real. It\u2019s not like, Mayor, nice day. She just looks at me and the first thing she says is, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re cutting in this line now.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d I waited in this long line. One year later, it\u2019s the Governor\u2019s race in New Jersey. I go to vote. Nobody is there. I walk right in and vote. I hugged the woman behind the table because she looks lonely. Then the results come out. Chris Christie narrowly wins that election. I look at the data. If just the cities in New Jersey had turned out a fraction of what they did a year before \u2013 then people are complaining to me. I told you, I\u2019m Mayor during the most difficult hand of cards. I\u2019ve got a Republican Governor who is now cutting back on funding. Again, New Jersey as a state had terrible problems. He just said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to fund cities like I used to.\u201d Trenton cuts off a third of their police department. I lay off 12 percent. Then we see the earned income tax credit, which is a way for working Americans making $30,000, $40,000 a year to get tax breaks. He ends that system. He cuts funding to Planned Parenthood which, again, different people on this recording might have different views on it, but for Newark, it was one of the best ways for people to get access to preventative care and prevent unplanned pregnancies. People were saying, \u201cWhy is Chris Christie doing this to us?\u201d My response to them is, \u201cChris Christie is not doing this to you. What\u2019s happening is we didn\u2019t come out and vote.\u201d What people don\u2019t understand, and King said this, again, nobody\u2019s evil here, but he said that the problem we\u2019ll have to repent in our day and age is not the vitriolic words and violent actions of the bad people, but the appalling silence and inaction of the good people. Tim Ferriss: Can I jump in for a second here? Cory Booker: Jump in, yeah. Tim Ferriss: All right. If you were providing a cheat sheet to people listening, maybe, and almost certainly people in the Carolinas were thinking, my God, that\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s in my backyard. I want to do something but I fear (a) it\u2019s too overwhelming, (b) I won\u2019t have an impact, or (c) maybe I could have an impact but I don\u2019t have the time. If you were providing, aside from ensuring that you vote on the things that you claim are of importance to you, what else, if you had a training school for super activists, what would some of the tenets be? Cory Booker: That\u2019s the point I guess I was trying to make with some of my earlier comments to you, which is the same point over and over again. It\u2019s this idea that Ms. Jones said. I was overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t know what to do. She didn\u2019t prescribe things. She said, \u201cdo something.\u201d The problem is, we often let things feel so big, we allow our inability to do everything to undermine our determination to do something. What people don\u2019t get is that you and I, and I know a little bit about your family history. You just heard a bit about mine. What if that person in North Carolina, again, my father\u2019s home state, said \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about segregation. I can\u2019t do anything about poverty. I can\u2019t do anything about lack of education for black kids in this town. It\u2019s terrible. Somebody should do something about it.\u201d What if instead they said, \u201cThis is one black kid named Cary Booker. I\u2019m going to give him a dollar to go to school.\u201d That act of love literally had a time/space jump that I am sitting here right now because a small group of small, North Carolina folks in the mountains decided that I can\u2019t change the world, but I can do one thing for one kid. There\u2019s a United States Senator where he is today because of those acts. Not one action done in a righteous cause. Look at people who are hacking our politics. Money is one of the most toxic influences on our politics, yet you just watched Bernie Sanders run a campaign where he didn\u2019t ask for one corporate dollar. Not because somebody said I only have $5 to give somebody. I believe in that candidate, I\u2019m going to give $5 to them. Well, all those small actions in the aggregate turned into a tidal wave of action. You and I, I don\u2019t know about you, but I get appeals for money a lot. If I can\u2019t help, I at least give a dollar or $5 to show I care about this issue and it\u2019s something important. That\u2019s my hope for anybody listening. Don\u2019t feel powerless ever. Alice Walker says the most common way people give up their power is believing they have none. We all are so much more powerful that we realize. Sometimes if we want to curse the world around us because it\u2019s not kind enough or there\u2019s too much cynicism, nothing is going to change about this world unless we do first. If that might just be doing the smallest thing, like I just spent this week reading about Yemen. It is awful, god awful what\u2019s going on there. But I can\u2019t get mad at other people for not knowing what\u2019s happening in Yemen. But if I say I\u2019m going to one thing. On my Facebook page, I\u2019m going to post a little bit more about the near-famine going on in Yemen. I\u2019m going to give people one instruction of an action they can take. If we were all doing that about issues we care about, we would be influencing each other. That\u2019s what I\u2019m just saying is I\u2019ve learned in my life, again, I got a little cut off, but if you\u2019re an activist or if you\u2019re a person, what is your life mission statement? Why is that not clear? What do you stand for? I don\u2019t care if your mission is to go out and make $1 billion. Are you getting up every single day and at least knowing what your mission is, what your values are and how you\u2019re going to fight the good fight as you know it? Are you living in allegiance to that? That\u2019s why I always say that\u2019s civic gospel. Before you tell me about your religion, show it to me in how you treat other people. How are you living in accordance to those values that you hold that you intellectually have and be that kind of activist? [Don\u2019t suddenly \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with suddenly waking up and saying I reject what\u2019s going on, but try to be consistent in what you do, even if it\u2019s a small way. Tim Ferriss: And maybe \u2013 I know we\u2019re coming up on time a little bit. But if we have a few more minutes, I was just going to reiterate and reinforce what you just said. Perhaps it\u2019s the word that scares people, \u201cactivist\u201d or \u201cactivism,\u201d because it sounds like a full-time job. If we were to maybe just call it being a good person as you define it in accordance with your values and so on. That you could look at it almost like a behavioral change of any type. If I\u2019m trying to get someone to change their diet, to take exercise as a new habit, I\u2019m going to want them to do less than they think they can do so they can build momentum in doing very small things. So no, it\u2019s not going to be the gym for five days a week an hour at a time. It\u2019s going to be five minutes in the gym twice a week. Anything beyond that is bonus credit. Diet? Great. Fixed your breakfast? Everything else you can keep the same. So they build momentum. The challenge that maybe I would issue to people listening is if it seems too big, keep ratcheting it down until it seems easy and then just make that your 30 minutes of being a good person for the week and put it in the calendar for a week from now. That could be donating $5, $10 to a classroom on donorschoose.com in the town where you grew up. It could be educating yourself for 15 minutes on a site like QuestBridge, which is another incredible, educational non-profit I\u2019m involved with. Make it small enough so that it\u2019s not intimidating, so it\u2019s easy. Cory Booker: That\u2019s the gift you gave me back in 2009 when you told me about working out. I think about you \u2013 and again, I feel like this is like I have little fan boy moments with you. But there are days I can\u2019t work out and I say to myself, Tim told me just raise your heart rate for 12 minutes. So from my home where I live in the Capitol to the Senate office building is a little over a mile. I don\u2019t have to sprint it. I\u2019m telling everybody right now. It\u2019s embarrassing. But it\u2019s about a 12-minute run for me. I think about you. I\u2019m saying like look, I\u2019m missing a workout because my Chief of Staff, closest friend, jerk over here doesn\u2019t schedule me time to work out. I think of Tim. I say at least I\u2019m going to get 12 minutes in. I\u2019m telling you right now, when it comes to being an activist, it\u2019s even as simple as this. I really believe that there should be more people being mentors in this world. I can\u2019t be a mentor myself, but I am going to once a week on social media post the link to Big Brothers and Big Sisters. Somebody, one of your circle of friends \u2013 if you have more than 100 followers \u2013 is one day \u2013 and if you post the data, you and I love data, about one mentor in a kid\u2019s life dramatically changes their life outcomes. If one person in the next month that you do that or two months that you do that once a week or whatever, one person is a mentor, you\u2019ve just helped to change somebody\u2019s life. So that\u2019s how much power you have. You don\u2019t even have to give the $10 to Big Brothers Big Sisters. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. There\u2019s so much we could do that we just don\u2019t do because we don\u2019t understand. With this power, I\u2019m holding up my smartphone right now, that we have to connect to people. I found this out as a political scientist, that more powerful than one of my political ads trying to get somebody to do something is someone posting information to their friends. It affects behavior more than we know. Tim Ferriss: So just a few very quick closing questions because we could talk for hours and hours and hours. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to do a Round\u00a02, because I know we have a lot of listener questions. Some of which were really fantastic. I apologize to people that we\u2019re not going to get to delegating today. We will get to it some other time hopefully. But what are some books that you have gifted the most to other people? Cory Booker: I have gifted your book a lot. It wasn\u2019t The 4-Hour Workweek. The book of yours that I gifted to anyone was The 4-Hour Body. I just thought there were so many great little hacks in there. Some of them Rated R. Tim Ferriss: Yes, yes, it is not all family programming, folks. Cory Booker: No, it is not all family. As I realized as I was handing to a teenager. Tim Ferriss: Well, that\u2019s why it was taken out of Costco. Because it also apparently is printed in such a way that it flips open to some pretty explicit diagrams. So for those who enjoy adult recreation, but fair warning. Cory Booker: Maybe I shouldn\u2019t even waste my time because most of the good folks who listen to you probably have already listened to that. Look, I thought Just Mercy, this book written by one of the greatest American heroes that I know, a guy named Bryan Stevenson, who is a death penalty defender. I try to consume as much as I can, so I do a lot of listening to books. That was one of the biggest books that I handed out. Tim Ferriss: Just Mercy. Cory Booker: Just Mercy, back in 2015. It is a beautiful listen. It\u2019s one of those books that is a really good story. It takes you out of where you probably are and lets you look into a window of aspects of our society that are really important. I\u2019m trying to think of other books. I\u2019m just going to open up my Audible. Oh, you know what book I loved? A buddy of mine wrote this book, and just for men and women that just want to work out a lot. The book about living with a Navy SEAL. Do you know what book I\u2019m talking about? Tim Ferriss: You know, I do know of the book and I\u2019m blanking on the title. Cory Booker: Living with a SEAL, that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s Jesse Itzler. If you are a workout guy, it reminds you of things you already know. That you can push your body and yourself far further than you think. I think I listened to that around the time I was starting to battle back into shape from being the heaviest I ever was. It was a wonderful book. He\u2019s going on to write more books like that. I\u2019m just going through some more of these. I listen to a lot of history and biography. Tim Ferriss: If you were to suggest people to start with one biography, if they\u2019d like to get into biographies but are not sure where to start? Cory Booker: I think Gandhi\u2019s autobiography is a profound read. I think Parting the Waters, Taylor Branch\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning book. If you\u2019re an American, it\u2019s just an unbelievable story of our country. Tim Ferriss: Question that you wish more people would ask themselves or that you wish people would ask themselves more often? Cory Booker: Well, it\u2019s productive for me to do a re-centering a lot. I think I even brought this up to Matt, who is my Chief of Staff, will get really into \u2013 in this context, we were deciding whether to do an interview that is kind of a quirky request that we got. It was so easy for me to fall back on why am I here in the Senate? What is my mission? I do really think that\u2019s a really productive thing. If you have an hour just to sit with an open notebook and just say, what am I about? What do I stand for? What are most important values? If you actually can do that and then actually have an honest conversation about am I living in accordance to my highest values? What legacy do I want to leave? What energy do I want to leave on this universe? I sat down with \u2013 and how I feel like I\u2019m doing more name dropping \u2013 but a guy I revere named Neil deGrasse Tyson. Tim Ferriss: I know Neil deGrasse Tyson. Brilliant guy. Cory Booker: Brilliant guy. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m hoping to have him on the podcast someday. Cory Booker: You should have him on. Neil, Neil! You should really come. People would really benefit. Talk about a guy who\u2019s nonpartisan. He\u2019s the guy that would give you that lecture about go where the science leads you, whether it\u2019s left or right. I\u2019ve heard him talk in ways that ticks off \u2013 if you\u2019re ticking off both sides of the political aisle, you\u2019re probably doing pretty good. But we had this conversation because I love, again, I love talking about things from a spiritual perspective, but I\u2019m now finding that science and religion are really \u2013 the frontiers of science really are very spiritual. So in astrophysics, I wanted him to confirm this with me. I was using it in major speeches, talking about stars are millions, if not hundreds of millions of light years away. That\u2019s what I wanted to confirm with him. I had always heard that we\u2019re looking at stars at night that have disappeared, but because their light goes on in perpetuity, we see those stars as if they\u2019re there, but they\u2019re really gone. He confirmed all of that. I said that\u2019s powerful that a being of energy could be gone millions of years ago, but we\u2019re still basking in its light, marveling at its glory, feeling its warmth. I said, \u201cWe are beings of energy too.\u201d So this idea that the energy we give off while we\u2019re alive, this idea that it dissipates. No, I\u2019m sorry. I am basking in the warmth of those men on the beaches of Normandy, as my Dad might say. I\u2019m basking in the warmth of those people who helped my family buy our first house. You\u2019ve got to see yourself as no good deed doesn\u2019t resonate. But the problem is, we all shrink ourselves. Bigotry, hatred, and negativity shrinks us. But what makes us bigger and bolder is courage and kindness and we get radiant when we live within those values. What are your moral values? Are you living by your highest, most luminescent self? Understand what your triggers are. When you get small? When do you get petty? I think that kind of self-work really helps you be more effective in living out your mission. You and I know this, if I got in my car and didn\u2019t know where I was going, I would just waste energy, waste fuel and what have you. But if you know like a laser beam where you\u2019re supposed to be headed, if you\u2019ve taken that time to do the work, when the craziness of life happens, you can easily fall back. Why am I here as a Senator? Why am I here as an entrepreneur? What values am I trying to do? I think we\u2019ve lost that. Capitalism is a great example. As a guy who loves a free market, capitalism got lost when we were allowing people in a very un-free market way to foist their costs off on society. Most people don\u2019t realize that a person working at an Ihop in Newark, you are subsidizing that IHOP by giving that \u2013 because I have friends that work at IHOP that live in public housing. It\u2019s taxpayer subsidizing. It\u2019s outsourcing the costs of paying somebody a living wage to the rest of people in society. Most people don\u2019t understand that capitalism, if you really read Adam Smith, in his Moral Sentiments, he really talks about the larger vision. And again, he\u2019s a Democrat. The head of AEI is a guy that talks about we as Americans don\u2019t believe capitalism and free markets are the end. We believe it\u2019s a pathway to reaching the free market. What I\u2019m saying is we remember why we have capitalism. This is why I love people who get perverted in their corporate goals, when it\u2019s just about that quarterly report. Well, if you look at some of the earliest entrepreneurs in America, they weren\u2019t looking at short-term views of their company. We\u2019ve allowed a lot of things to erode our moral compass and make us smaller and greater because we don\u2019t reset what are we really about as a society? Why did we form as a nation? What are our guiding principles? Live more in accordance to those. Tim Ferriss: Last question: do you have any ask of the audience? Something you wish the people listening would do or think about and where can people find you, say hello, learn more about what you are up to? Cory Booker: The easiest way to find me is if you have social media platforms is @corybooker, C-O-R-Y B-O-O-K-E-R on any platform. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and I try to do my best to live my authenticity on those platforms. I guess my request for people which is tough today, I think that I do worry about the divisions in our nation. If I\u2019m worrying about something, I\u2019m trying to do something myself to heal those. That\u2019s why when I went to the Senate, I told my state, I\u2019m not going down as a Democratic Senator, I\u2019m going down as a Senator from our state and I\u2019m going to listen to Bill Bradley, who was one of my mentors, to try to do everything I can to create working relationships with my Senators. So, Republican Senators like Deb Fischer, she and I have done such good works together. Senators like Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, we\u2019ve done really good work together. Rand Paul, who is a guy people wouldn\u2019t imagine, but he and I have done really good work together. I guess I\u2019m saying that as a preamble to say this. It\u2019s a shame that in our society we\u2019re creating divisions that are so deep between us that we fail to see each other or hear other. Back to how we started about non-judgmentalism and leading with a courageous empathy. My request for people is one of my first mentors in Newark, this amazing tenant leader who led the longest rent strike in our city\u2019s history back in the \u201870s. He won against the government. It was public housing. He led people on this amazing rent strike. This crotchety, you look at him and he was not dressed in fancy clothes. But I watched him at tenant meetings. You and I have both been to them \u2013 whether dorm meetings, whatever. Everybody wants their moment and they speak for too long. But I watched this guy just look at everybody with these eyes that he was listening to you. While I\u2019m getting nudging and tired, he\u2019s still looking at people. The irony of his sight was that he went blind. Yet, he would tease me every time I\u2019d see him. I\u2019d say, \u201cHey, Frank, it\u2019s Cory.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI see you.\u201d Anyway, I want to end with my request to everyone. And I\u2019m foreshadowing what I hope to share with some of the students who I\u2019m going to speak to in a commencement speech in a couple months. His last words to me were \u2013 I walk into his room and he\u2019s in hospice. My ego, which I need to check, is upset. I\u2019m like, this guy, tens of thousands of human beings had heat and hot water or stayed in their homes because of him. Why is he dying without crowds of people? This guy taught me that significance is more important than celebrity. That purpose is more important than popularity. He lived a life of great purpose and great significance. I go into his hospice room after the nurses have told me that it\u2019s not going to be long. He can barely talk. I hope many people have not heard people towards the end of their lives. I saw this with my father and others. Your breath gets really short. But yet he was aware enough to know that I came in the room and I announced myself and he forces out these words that used to be what he used to always tease me with. I go, \u201cHey, Frank, it\u2019s Cory.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI see you.\u201d I spent time with him, I hugged him and kissed him on the forehead right before I left. I said to him, \u201cI love you, Frank.\u201d His last words to me were, \u201cI love you.\u201d I think about that. \u201cI see you,\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI see you, I love you.\u201d We have lost our way in a sense in America, or at least many of us. Maybe I\u2019ll implicate myself. That we think the highest calling of this country is tolerance. We\u2019re a nation of tolerance as if that\u2019s a good thing. But tolerance says if you disappear off the face of the earth, if you\u2019re that person at that party and you just disappear, we\u2019d be better off or I wouldn\u2019t be worse off because I was just tolerating you. But this country, as our founders said in the Declaration of Independence, pledging to each other an irrational commitment, this country says, we were not called for tolerance, we were called for love. To move beyond tolerate to that because love always see worth, sees dignity, sees value in the other person and knows actually that if your kids do well, if your kids become an entrepreneur or an artist or a teacher, my kids are going to benefit from that. That is what makes a great society. We cannot tolerate each other. We cannot tolerate divisions. We have to find ways to stitch this country together with love. So my request to everybody listening is you can be fervently against a Republican. You can be fervently against a Democrat. You can be fervently against those people who are marching in the streets or what have you. My request is that we all try to, all of us, including me, starting with me, try to see each other, our humanity, our dignity, and try to love each other. I see you, I love you. Love demands a surrender of ego for a little while. It demands a courageous empathy, as we\u2019ve talked about. It demands a surrendering of your position. Not always, but for a moment, let me imagine what it is like to be you. Love demands you learning about somebody else. I love my Irish-American colleagues or my Jewish-American colleagues. Have I taken the time to learn about the Irish experience in America? Which is one of the great stories of America. The Japanese-American experience. What a great story of America. Have I learned about you so this idea that people always say the Biblical sense of \u201cknowing each other.\u201d But love, not Eros love, but Agape love necessitates knowledge, knowing one another as well. I guess that\u2019s a long-winded way of saying my request for all of us, for people that you think you disagree with, take time to see them and to feel in your heart a love that Americans should feel for each other. You don\u2019t have to agree with each other. Always like each other. But do you sincerely believe that patriotism obliges you to love Americans? If it does, then really try to love, which is not a being word, it\u2019s an active word. It necessitates us acting towards our neighbor with a certain level of commitment. Tim Ferriss: I think that\u2019s the perfect place to end. Cory, thank you so much for taking the time. Cory Booker: Thank you. I\u2019m blown away that you would have me on. Tim Ferriss: Well, it\u2019s great to see you again and I hope that we don\u2019t go as long before the next time we see each other. Thank you again. I really appreciate the entire team making time. Cory Booker: Thank you. I\u2019ll say this one more time. You are one of the sources of inspiration in my life and more than just inspiration \u2013 education. I\u2019ve learned a lot from you as a guy. I see you as a peer, but in many ways, you are one of the teachers of my life and I appreciate you, Professor Ferriss. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Thank you, Cory. Well, you said you were a Paduan at one point earlier. I think you\u2019re definitely in that teacher role and certainly in that leadership role. This is a conversation I hope we can continue. For everybody listening, as always, you can find the show notes for this episode, links to all of the books, documentaries and many other things mentioned at tim.blog/podcast. You can find links to the show notes for all other episodes there. Until next time, thank you for listening.

dad\u2019s work ethic and my mom\u2019s work ethic \u2013 as i get older, i more appreciate my mother", "i don\u2019t think i appreciated it as much when i was young", "but my father was one of these

people,\u201d \u2013 and i would get the lecture, you know", "it was easy for him to do that lecture because he knew that i knew that i was very different than my peers in the sense that i was black", "as my father called us, we were the four raisins in the tub of sweet vanilla ice cream", "we were definitely not the norm in terms of race in the town", "so then he could easily tell me how i got there", "look, when my parents moved to new jersey, i grew up in the northeastern county, the one that looks across the palisades, across the hudson river at new york, north of the george washington bridge", "my father basically is like, \u201clook, what took us to get here?\u201d when my parents when they tried to buy homes in bergen county, there was only a handful of towns in this 70-town county, 70-plus-town county, that would let blacks move in", "they didn\u2019t have laws at the time", "people think the north \u2013 it was the south that that the segregation laws", "no, it was real estate steering", "black family shows up", "\u201clet me show you homes in teaneck or englewood or hackensack", "you don\u2019t want to go up here.\u201d so what my parents ended up doing, a group of just \u2013 again, blacks and whites joined together to create a storefront operation called the fair housing council", "they would go with blacks, my parents, and send a white couple right behind them", "my parents would look at a house, be told it was sold", "the white couple would come and find out the house is still for sale", "on this house that my parents fell in love with, 123 norma road in harrington park, new jersey, they were told it was sold", "the white couple came and found out it was still for sale", "the white couple puts a bid on the house, papers are drawn up", "on the day of the closing, my father shows up and a volunteer lawyer, a guy named marty friedman, a jewish lawyer who just on his own time wanted to help black families out", "literally, the real estate agent stands up angrily when he realizes he got caught in a sting operation", "he doesn\u2019t relent", "he doesn\u2019t say, yeah, i broke the law", "no, he punches my dad\u2019s lawyer in the face and [inaudible]", "always a great response", "and puts a dog on my dad", "literally, sics his dog on my dad", "i always joke that every time, as i got older and older, the dog got bigger", "eventually, it was like a pack of wolves", "\u201cand i fought a pack of wolves so you could eat that tuna fish sandwich.\u201d but then we move into this home", "for me, as my father would say to me, he says, \u201cyou\u2019re drinking from wells of freedom and liberty and opportunity that you didn\u2019t dig", "you\u2019re eating from banquet tables prepared for you by your ancestors.\u201d this is the kind of stuff my parents inspired my understanding to recognize that if you have the luck \u2013 i just had a senate hearing last week about yemen and 3 million internally displaced people, war, it\u2019s a country on the brink of famine, which is not something that the u.n", "does lightly to talk about widespread famine", "if you have the fortune, the blessing of being born an american, you are in the rarefied of rarefied airs in humanity, if you\u2019re american in the 21st century", "what my parents did a good job of bringing fully to my consciousness through the portal and lens of the black experience, but frankly i don\u2019t care if you\u2019re irish-american, if you\u2019re indian-american, this is all of us how much effort had to go", "it wasn\u2019t abraham lincoln and fdr, no", "it was good folk, ordinary folks who just said, \u201cyou know what", "i may be jewish, you may be christian", "i may be black, you may be white, but we are in this together", "if you\u2019re facing an injustice, it\u2019s a problem with me.\u201d i\u2019d hear, before i\u2019d even studied this stuff in history, \u201cson, people stormed beaches in normandy for you", "they swept floors for you", "they went on freedom rides for you.\u201d so if any sort of family mantra that was there for my brother and i is, yeah, you have an obligation to take the blessings god gave you and work is the most important thing", "don\u2019t let anybody ever outwork you", "you and i have shared this in sports or what have you", "work ethic is important", "but service has got to be a part of that too", "you owe a debt you can\u2019t pay back to your ancestors", "you\u2019ve got to pay it forward by paying it to other people", "so you played ball", "you ended up at sandford", "i always say i got into stanford because of a 4.0 and 1,600", "4.0 yards per carry, 1,600 receiving yards", "you grew up, as i understand it, about a mile or two away from a previous guest, john crowley", "so he suggested that i ask you about \u2013 and i know nothing about football, so i\u2019m getting into the deep end of my ignorance pool here, but lou holtz trying to recruit you", "maybe you could provide some context for people who don\u2019t even know who lou holtz is", "well, lou holtz is probably one of the greatest american college football coaches of all times", "i was, in all fairness, because the older we get, the better we were at our sports, but in all fairness, i was probably the most overrated high school football player ever", "people thought i could part the seas of linebackers and score anytime i wanted to", "it was a lot of hype", "i think the song back then by public enemy was \u201cdon\u2019t believe the hype.\u201d that was written, i think, about my football career", "but i had a choice of going anywhere", "i just looked at it", "you went to princeton", "again, this idea that okay, i have a chance to get a full scholarship to any college in the country", "i\u2019m going to go \u2013 because of my parents\u2019 wiring \u2013 to the best academic school i can go to", "i looked at duke and stanford and uva", "but notre dame was definitely on that list", "lou holtz is probably one of the most persuasive human beings ever and i always talk about the fact \u2013 and definitely an embellished story \u2013 but going out there and lou holtz, who is a short man", "i\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and i would say he\u2019s like 5\u2019 and a smidgen", "but a booming guy", "you look up to him right when you meet him", "he just gives me the best sell you could imagine", "we actually go into the notre dame locker room and there\u2019s my jersey with my high school number on it", "needless to say, you\u2019re 17, 18 years old", "this is amazing", "lou holtz goes, \u201ctake a knee.\u201d when lou holtz says take a knee, i\u2019m a christian boy, but i bowed before that man", "then he gives me the best pre-game speech i\u2019d ever heard in my life", "he pulls from all history", "he\u2019s talking about the gipper", "he even talks about rudy, for crying out loud", "he goes to rudy", "so i\u2019m all hyped up and then he goes, \u201crise, cory booker, rise.\u201d it didn\u2019t take a muscle twitch", "i literally elevated up into the air after he told me that", "i\u2019m ready to go out and chop down trees", "then notre dame, you go through this little tunnel", "there\u2019s like a four-leaf clover there or something you hit", "i don\u2019t care if you\u2019re black, if you\u2019re from bangladesh, when you touch that irish, the irish isles call you", "you feel your irish ancestry", "i\u2019m fully baked", "then i walk down through the tunnel", "you get on the field and holtz is still in your ear and it\u2019s like as if he\u2019s narrating your moment on that field", "i\u2019m walking down and \u201ccory booker, you\u2019re going to score a touchdown in that end zone.\u201d so you get to that end zone and then you turn around and the field is like a bowl", "but there\u2019s a building behind the field that\u2019s called \u2013 it\u2019s their library i think", "on the field, there\u2019s a picture, a mural of jesus christ with his arms up as if he\u2019s saying touchdown", "in fact, his nickname is \u201ctouchdown jesus.\u201d the only time you can see it \u2013 so i turn around and now i don\u2019t care if you\u2019re baha\u2019i, sikh, christian, jewish, you see touchdown jesus after lou holtz has pumped you up \u2013 it is a conversion moment", "i knew what jesus wanted from me at that moment", "he wanted me to score a touchdown in that end zone", "i\u2019m swearing i\u2019m going to score a touchdown", "i get home and my parents are like, \u201cwhere are you going to school?\u201d \u201ci\u2019m going to notre dame!\u201d it took them psychologists and \u2013 they had to deprogram you", "they had to deprogram me to eventually get me to go to stanford when i realized that we played notre dame in their end zone", "in my senior year, my best career game was against notre dame", "we weren\u2019t even ranked in the top 50", "notre dame was ranked no", "1 in the country", "we were going in and everybody said we were going to get killed by 10, 20 points", "they score a touchdown, we score a touchdown", "we\u2019re actually staying with them", "i had this pass over the middle and todd light, an all-american corner \u2013 i have one move in sports and he must have not watched the film, but it\u2019s basically me throwing my hips one way and running the other way as quickly as i can", "he actually fell down and i\u2019m running towards touchdown jesus", "i\u2019m hearing the lord calling to me", "\u201cthis is what i\u2019ve wanted from you for your life.\u201d i get tackled from behind by some spawn from hell, who takes me out", "eventually, we scored a touchdown and won the game", "but my notre dame experiences \u2013 i love the school", "if anything, i learned from that because we had no right to be in that end zone", "i used to always tell people my true lesson from that story is that if you have the right team, you can be up against people that are superior athletes, superior intellect or whatever, but a good team, people together, can beat any group of great individuals", "okay, that is a fantastic story", "we are going to talk about delegating a team i think a little bit later because there were some listener questions about that", "but i want to talk about persuasion", "you mentioned lou was very persuasive", "i think of you as very persuasive and you\u2019re a very gifted speaker", "i think we\u2019re going to take a slight left turn", "it\u2019s going to seem that way, but it\u2019s related", "we talked a little bit about this before we started recording", "correct me if i\u2019m wrong here, but you ran a student-run crisis hotline", "yeah", "at stanford", "could you talk about that", "specifically, i want to know what did you learn about that experience and what works when you are on a crisis hotline", "this is a crisis hotline called the bridge at stanford", "it was probably one of the best life experiences because i was sort of a teenager going into my early 20s and it was the first non-profit i ran in this collective of other leaders", "there were five of us that lived at the center 24 hours a day, would cover the night", "you have to understand when i just started as a counselor there, i\u2019m this 18-year-old or 19-year-old young man who, a lot of us i don\u2019t think get this understanding that we\u2019ve lived our lives in our own lane and we don\u2019t necessarily get to pull back the screen and talk to other people about their experiences beyond the niceties we\u2019d exchange every day", "i can\u2019t remember who said about \u201cbe kind to one another because we\u2019re all fighting a hard battle.\u201d it might have been socrates or someone", "but it basically punched me square in my nose about how important kindness and empathy is because when i started sitting on that phone and on a friday night, i was so shaken", "because we would have rape calls", "i had women that were there, i still remember one girl named alison who would pick up women that were escaping spousal abuse", "there was another counselor there named danielle bowe, another amazingly beautiful human being", "i just had no idea how \u2013 again, this early \u201880s, early \u201890s \u2013 how ignorant i was about gay and lesbian americans and how many biases had stemmed from my ignorance", "sitting down and having people calling about their experiences coming out", "hearing the truth of people talking about thinking about killing themselves because they are not attracted to someone of a different sex or talking about the horrors they experienced and abuses they experienced", "or eating disorders and being in forms of honest conversation about how just saying something to somebody like, \u201chey, you\u2019re gaining some weight,\u201d and how comments like that can hurt", "or what it\u2019s like just growing up in an environment where you\u2019re constantly being told that your worth is based upon how much weight you have", "i can go on and on and on, but it was one of those places where i felt like stanford is great and my course load got great, but i learned so much about empathy and about listening and about non-judgmentalism, sort of the fundamental core", "we literally had the first five rules of peer counseling that were about empathy, that were about non-judgmentalism, about listening", "do you recall specifically what any of those rules were", "some of them were as simple as \u201cbe non-judgmental.\u201d that\u2019s something that i think \u2013 i literally was just talking with one of my closest friends about that yesterday because they were going off about someone who was involved in a protest or something and how it wasn\u2019t sincere and so on and so forth", "we just don\u2019t realize how often we\u2019re casting judgment when we know nothing about the person", "we know nothing about their struggle and we just are so quick to judge other people", "how harsh it would be back to us", "to actually be taught to be a counselor to somebody and hold no judgment of them whatsoever or to suppress that and just be there to listen and to give them empathy", "all these are often tags for love", "it was a powerful lesson for me", "i guess what i\u2019m saying to you is i think there\u2019s something about persuasion that people often go about it as thinking about how am i going to convince you to do something", "i think about that from the start of no, it\u2019s not about me and what i\u2019m going to do to you to get you to do something, it\u2019s actually about me being there for you and opening myself up to create a safe space for me to actually listen and hear you", "this has been a hard lesson", "when i was living in really a tough environment in newark \u2013 when i first moved there i was living in some high-rise projects which became public housing \u2013 it\u2019s like these same lessons you\u2019re meant to hear on your journey in life, when you start getting the same thing over and over again to try to teach you", "i think the universe tries to do it the easy way first, but when you see the same thing coming \u2013 but this idea of empathy", "now, in our society, and you and i sort of touched on this, i\u2019m one of these people that gets kind of bothered that we\u2019ve stopped listening to each other", "i wish i could find this study and i asked my team to help me find it", "but i remember being on an airplane reading a study, and i thought it was usa today about a public policy position in education", "they said this is the democratic position", "immediately 80 percent of republicans were against it", "they didn\u2019t even know it", "they flipped it around", "democrats were the same way", "they said this is a republican policy", "80 percent of democrats were against it", "it just shifted by just labeling it republican or democrat", "what i often find is we\u2019re at a point in our society right now where we have just stopped listening to each other and stopped being empathetic, and instead are leading with that judgment", "the problem with that is it disables us and our ability to come together to do the kind of things that need to move our society forward", "that\u2019s why i think now more than ever, and i say this in my speeches all the time, in america we need a courageous empathy, where we are willing to let go of our own ego and tune into to another human being, to really listen to them", "i may not agree with that black lives matter march", "they may offend me, but we\u2019re all wired the same way", "so why are they out there yelling and screaming", "is it because they\u2019re bad and i\u2019m judging them, or am i taking time to really try to surrender my own position for a minute and listen to that person in the midwest who is a serious trump supporter and try to really understand where they\u2019re coming from", "i want to talk about both \u2013 and i might separate these two out \u2013 but the empathy and the courage, which are going to be recurring themes", "on the empathy side of things, what you just said reminded me on a micro level of what bryan johnson said to me once", "he described all-hands meetings or town hall meetings for braintree, which he then sold to ebay for, i want to say, $600 million or something like that, $900 million", "at that point, who cares", "i mean, it\u2019s a big number", "he said that when he had all-hands meetings, people were very hesitant to bring up certain problems", "he would stand there and he would make jokes about himself and mistakes he had made and wait until, as he put it, people would bring up the pebble in their shoe", "he said very often that was all needed to solve the problem was to give someone the space and elicit them to talk about the pebble in their shoe", "in the case of the crisis hotline, what are some of the tools that you used to either make people feel better or calm them down", "how do you go about doing that when, let\u2019s say, even in your own head you might be subconsciously judging a situation or making assumptions", "are there any particular lines or questions", "because you\u2019re no stranger to conflict", "you\u2019ve been in a fair number of street fights", "yes", "not literal, but, well, i mean, you certainly have", "there\u2019s a lot of excitement in the biography of cory booker", "but how do you calm people down and diffuse situations", "are there any particular words or questions or any tactics that you use", "there\u2019s definitely a tactic and i want to talk about that", "just to give more affirmation of what bryan was doing", "i wrote a book the year before last called united", "the best reaction i was hoping from people who read the book was to say, wait a minute, this is not what a politician would write", "because i wanted to write about \u2013 and there\u2019s five or six major instances in a book or actually a lot of more smaller ones \u2013 of this is me being a jerk", "this is me being a royal ass", "this is a big mistake i made", "i don\u2019t mind being a little vulnerable here because i find that vulnerability actually creates a climate for all of us to learn", "i think it\u2019s bad when we put people on pedestals", "i think it\u2019s so much better when we \u2013 this is why i like biography \u2013 when we see people", "like lyndon johnson was a jerk in terms of the way he treated other people", "martin luther king, cornel west always talks about it, the santa claus-ification of martin luther king", "he was a complex man with flaws", "i think that makes it more accessible and real when you realize that", "so i think that what he was doing was creating an environment where, let me tell you what i did that was really dumb, it gives people a safe space for them to start sharing and build more effective teams when you have those kind of connections", "but in terms of a tactic for counseling, which is a tactic that we all know already, those of us who practice this, who\u2019ve been up at night and you can\u2019t sleep, you have anxiety", "you open a book and you just write down what you\u2019re anxious about", "suddenly, it\u2019s real and on the paper and it\u2019s a really a good way to get to a point where you go from the emotional anxiety of it all to suddenly seeing it in a more objective way", "not that it still doesn\u2019t have emotional triggers and the like, but you see it in a more objective way", "i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably done that yourself", "i actually very routinely do something called morning pages, which is effectively trapping those anxieties and monkey mind-generated insecurities or emotions on paper so that i can get on with my day", "right, and most of us don\u2019t understand how in our own lives, something simple \u2013 we allow our minds to do things to us that are horrible", "the most important conversations you have every day are the ones you have with yourself, that you\u2019re not even often aware of", "that\u2019s a great way to put it", "we\u2019re driving ourselves often insane with these scripts", "sometimes they\u2019re just a little bit below the consciousness of the scripts we\u2019re running", "sometimes when you take a pause \u2013 this is why just breathing in and out, just taking a moment to remember to breath or meditation is a tool that i love that you talk about also, but writing something down", "in a counseling setting, often what moves a person to call a crisis hotline is they\u2019re at a peak moment of emotion or distress or worry", "that\u2019s where the active listening comes in", "people have this mis-idea about being a counselor that they\u2019re somehow going in there, getting great advice", "i can\u2019t solve your problems", "but you are equipped", "from a person of faith, i don\u2019t really believe the universe puts anything on you or god puts anything on you that you can\u2019t handle", "sometimes you need to know the right people to go to or the right person to ask", "but i think the tactic of just allowing somebody to talk and being a good filter or paraphraser back to the person", "so maybe it\u2019s not physically writing it down, but that person is beginning to hear themselves and be able to sort through what\u2019s going on and help them start to see strategies that they could be pursuing to make themselves better", "we all have so much more wisdom inside of us than we give ourselves credit for", "i want to flash forward, given the memento-like scripting or lack of scripting in these conversations, i\u2019m sure chronologically it will be challenged, but we\u2019ll jump around a little bit", "as we were doing a sound check before we started, i asked you what you had for breakfast today and you said, \u201ci\u2019m fasting today.\u201d yes", "now, i have, as you know, a deep interest in fasting", "i thought that we might touch on a ten-day hunger strike", "correct me if this is inaccurate", "but as i understand, it was to bring attention to open-air drug dealing and related violence and so on at the time", "can you place us in terms of what you were doing at the time and why you chose to take that approach", "right", "your question has so many things i want to talk about with you because the whole concept of fasting and the benefits of fasting, i so want to talk to you about it because i\u2019ve learned so much from you about it already", "now it\u2019s become a regular part of my practice", "how do you fast", "i\u2019m curious", "to take you through the tim ferriss effects on my life, which are many \u2013 you are such a good soul because you make yourself vulnerable", "i think that\u2019s one of your attributes", "you know that you are a schmuck at times, like we all are", "and you admit that", "which again, makes me feel a brotherhood with you", "but yet you have like my father, that dogged work ethic where you\u2019re willing \u2013 and also a willingness to hurl yourself off cliffs with no parachute", "as my mris can attest to", "yes", "and i find, by the way, i\u2019m in a profession that does not like risk", "politicians are like what is the least amount of risk that i can have because i don\u2019t want to offend anybody, god forbid", "you have no problems", "i think you\u2019re good at that", "but i think my best times learning \u2013 and we can get back to the ten-day hunger strike, because this was a big moment \u2013 when i take the greatest risks and i just hurl myself off", "that was an act of desperation", "but i love the fact that you\u2019re willing to use yourself and embrace this idea that i don\u2019t have all the answers and i\u2019m going to try to learn something", "i\u2019ve following you through a lot of your journeys and learned a lot myself and hacks, shortcuts, by learning from you", "so you go to that moment where we met and talked deeper, years ago", "it was 2009, i think, where you helped me get my physical health back", "but it\u2019s something i\u2019ve always seemed to be able to sacrifice my physical health and my own wellbeing and relationships", "this terrible view i\u2019ve had to fight where it\u2019s all about the service, it\u2019s all about the mission", "but self-care, i\u2019ve learned as i\u2019ve gotten wiser, is so important", "it\u2019s like stephen covey sharpening the saw", "but most of us forget that", "i then went back and gained a ridiculous amount of weight", "i was over 300 pounds again", "it was a few of my friends talking to be about intermittent fasting that was a tactic", "obviously, there was a lot more going on when you\u2019re in that moment, but it was a great tactic to use", "it was everybody from a congresswoman who was hearing this", "a lot of people started giving me that information", "but it was ezra klein", "i was on his podcast and we started talking about it", "he was just talking about not eating until noon most days, or 11:00 a.m., if i remember exactly", "so i hurled myself into trying it", "the more i tried it, i found so many benefits to my life of doing two to three days a week, of doing what they call intermittent fasting, 500 calories or less a day", "i can talk to you about all the benefits i found, but your podcasts about the subject matter about everything from cancers to alzheimer\u2019s", "yeah, dominic d\u2019aogstino, probably", "that was exactly it", "but i remember that you said something on one of your podcasts about the stress you used to have if you missed a meal", "oh, god, i\u2019m in the airport, i missed breakfast", "where am i going to get this", "and how much peace i have now where even on days i\u2019m eating, i\u2019m like wait a minute, i\u2019ve gone three days without eating", "why am i stressing over that", "or just the mind space", "it clogs your head thinking about food and all the time that suddenly i get a more zen-like path", "my chief of staff, who\u2019s sitting in here to leap at me should i say something that he\u2019s unhappy with, but on days that i eat, i get that 3:00, 4:00 exhaustion where i need a nap", "on days i\u2019m fasting, i don\u2019t feel the need to take a nap", "so i can go on about intermittent fasting", "i\u2019m of these people, again, like you in my life, there have been moments where i\u2019ve just said, i\u2019m going to try something for three months, like becoming a vegetarian", "i was a peak athlete at the time", "i just said i\u2019m going to try this and see what it does to my body", "i stayed with vegetarianism first and foremost, i\u2019d like to say it was for environmental or ethical reasons", "my body just jumped to a whole new level of performance when i first shifted to becoming a vegetarian", "so that was the first thing that sort of like, wow, this feels great", "but this is something i tried in my life, intermittent fasting, that really works", "it\u2019s very different than the ten-day hunger strike", "you\u2019ve inspired me", "you said you now do some days just water, as you see me here drinking this green juice", "green juice", "no, there are different ways to go about it", "we\u2019ll get into fasting for a second", "there are those like valter longo, for instance, a researcher who\u2019s talked a lot about the fast mimicking diet, which is generally, i think it is fewer than 500 calories per day for anywhere from say three to five days", "i\u2019ve tended to go more in the water fast direction, maybe allowing some fats like coconut oil or mct oil, which is something that dominic d\u2019agostino, who is the ph.d", "who first talked about fasting on the podcast, or peter attia, another, in that case, an m.d", "example", "let\u2019s talk about ten", "because ten is serious commitment", "right", "the one thing you do that i can\u2019t is testing your blood and seeing if you\u2019re hitting ketosis", "i listen to all that and say to myself, \u201cdear, god, tim", "i can\u2019t my blood tested.\u201d but i can tell you, at ten days, you\u2019re in ketosis, for sure", "but you have to, just before i get into this ten-day fast, my chief of staff and i were in the middle east", "i wanted to go to iraq", "we were meeting everybody from the prime minister to the leader of the opposition", "we were in baghdad", "when we got there, i decide, you know what", "i\u2019m going to, the entire time i\u2019m here, i\u2019m just going to fast", "it was almost this sort of spiritual experience when you\u2019re dealing with real, very serious issues", "but still, i was amazed at how much energy i had, now much clarity of thought", "i hope, that as you do with your life and inspire me to do with mine, is that people just try stuff", "don\u2019t put such a level on that if it\u2019s noon and you\u2019re fasting and you suddenly start eating, don\u2019t hate yourself", "but i think it\u2019s the kind of stuff we should do is we should experiment", "what\u2019s gandhi\u2019s autobiography", "what is it", "the title of it is my experiments with truth", "i think we all should take things, not just fasting, but i\u2019m a christian, but so you know what", "i\u2019m going to do a little bit to study islam", "i hear all this talk about islam, let me study it", "just doing little experiments in your life to learn, to grow, to help understand", "i think it\u2019s just an incredible way to learn", "and actually, at the other end of experiments that i do with my life, i always find myself better and more enriched", "let me jump in for one second because i want to underscore what you just said", "those experiments can take many different forms", "so it could be a three-month experiment with vegetarianism", "it could be a one-day experiment with fasting", "and obviously, folks listening, i am not a doctor", "neither of are doctors and don\u2019t play doctors on the internet", "talk to your medical professional", "but all of that said, experiments can also take the form, and i do this a lot when i journal, of thought experiments", "one of the more productive brainstorming session that i observed recently was about a group of 15", "the moderator started, because there were a lot of heated topics that were going to come up, political or otherwise", "he said, \u201clet\u2019s start with everyone, each person, we\u2019ll go around the room, thinking of one of their most deeply held beliefs, taking the opposite viewpoint and then justifying it or explaining why it\u2019s correct.\u201d so assuming, taking one of your deepest held beliefs, taking the opposite, and then actually giving a compelling argument", "this is something that i believe has the nickname \u201csteel manning,\u201d as opposed to \u201cstraw manning.\u201d darwin actually did this in origin of species", "to prepare for the onslaught of criticism that he would receive, he predicted and pre-empted many of the positions that his critics would take", "he did not dismiss them", "he actually made them the strongest versions of those criticisms that he could and then addressed them in the book so that he would be prepared", "that was one of the experiments that i most enjoyed observing as a moderator to set the tone, which i thought was really productive", "again, you can\u2019t interview all the great people on this podcast because many of them have died, but many of them left clues for how they experimented", "like ben franklin, he didn\u2019t mean to write his autobiography", "he wanted to write a note to his family about what he\u2019d learned in his experiments", "he would take one theme", "just imagine if we all said, okay, today i\u2019m going to look at the idea of gratitude and figure it out through this experiment", "mark zuckerberg said, \u201cokay, i\u2019m going to have a year where every day i say thank you to somebody and write those notes.\u201d these are glorious sort of journeys or odysseys to see where it leads you and it doesn\u2019t always do it", "you\u2019re right, they can be just one moment", "you know what, sunday is my day of faith and i\u2019m going to honor god by not going to the church i go to all the time", "maybe i\u2019m going to go down into camden, new jersey and go to a black church or maybe i\u2019m going to go to a latino church", "or let\u2019s think crazy", "maybe i\u2019m going to go a mosque or a synagogue just to experience that and meet different people", "we get caught in these grooves and we\u2019re playing the same record over and over again", "just doing one thing differently, we may not like it, but it actually is going to stretch and broaden us and actually change our, as you know, i know you\u2019ve studied a lot about brains and how we work, just by changing the synapsis of that normal routine, even something as simple as you and i have read about, don\u2019t drive the same way to work every day", "there are collateral benefits that brain scientists will say to you that benefit your life in other ways", "definitely", "i\u2019m not going to forget about this hunger strike", "we\u2019re getting to it, folks", "but we might end up in a more interesting place by taking some detours", "by the name phil zimbardo came up before we started recording", "for those people who don\u2019t know, he was one of the lead investigator, if not the designer of the protocol, the stanford prison experiment", "which is profound", "which is profound, and many experiments afterward that showed how you could influence good people to behave in evil ways or neutral people to behave in evil ways", "there are some really interesting studies that have looked at so-called good samaritans and how you can impact their behavior based on a feeling of urgency and so on", "but the point i was going to make is that he encourages people to do what he calls the \u201cdeviant for a day\u201d experiment", "it\u2019s, in effect, doing something that is so out of character or so socially odd that people might criticize you or at least look at you in an unusual way", "the example he gave was encouraging his students to put, much like ash wednesday, where people will put ash on the forehead", "but put a mark on your forehead and walk around all day and even if people try to take it off of your forehead, which they probably will, refuse to do that and keep it on", "just so you become more comfortable with discomfort", "that could though, deviant for a day, could take the form of say going to a church you would never think of going to", "or changing your routine in such a way that maybe \u2013 i met someone recently who took, and this can be a complicated subject, but he routinely does not give money to homeless people, but will invite them to dinner and have an entire dinner with homeless people", "he\u2019s done this, i want to say half a dozen to a dozen times", "let\u2019s just say hypothetically that you earmarked \u2013 for me it\u2019s usually saturday that i do these experiments", "i met someone, a technologist, recently who\u2019s decided that even though he\u2019s not particularly religious, he is jewish, but he\u2019s going to observe the shabbat and from, i think it\u2019s sundown to sundown, for one day a week on the weekend", "he is not going to use any technology whatsoever because he realizes how dependent he has become and how distracted he\u2019s become based on that", "hunger strike", "i promised \u2013 hold on", "i just \u2013 because the problem with you is you give these \u2013 well, first of all, when you talk about stoicism and this idea of dressing for one day in rags", "there\u2019s such a power of teaching ourselves to be more empathetic to people who might have different experiences", "i was a stanford student who did graduate work in sociology", "just watching actual experiments, not experimenting myself", "there was an experiment, i think you can still get the video of it, where you have rooms full of different people that all sit in one cohort \u2013 a bunch of guys", "and you put two or three women in there and just watch how many times a woman tries to speak and gets cut off versus the men in the room, when they try to speak", "it made me, even if you do 50/50 in the room, it just made me suddenly wake up and start looking for that pattern in my own conversations that i had in life", "it was a really mind-blowing experience for me", "another experiment we did where we were the experiments in the room where we all had to reach into a bag and we pulled out a chip and the chip was yellow, blue or red, let\u2019s say", "it decided the station we had in this game", "whether you were the upper class, middle class or lower class in this game", "the rules of the upper class were great", "they really benefitted us", "so we knew what the game was", "okay, this is like class society", "but we quickly, in the upper class, made laws that protected us", "and the lower class people, but what was interesting about the game more than that was that groups were sat in different areas and the animosities amongst players that began", "the anger and the defensiveness and the shouting", "it descended into a very bad place", "to the point at the end of the experiment, they said, i want everybody to take their chips, throw them on the ground, and stamp on them", "they had us do a bunch of exercises to get that \u2013 purge", "purge you", "just like zimbardo\u2019s prison experiment, as well as this, i think the game was called star power or something like that", "how quickly we fall into these roles", "so for me, i had this one experience where i went from living in affluent suburbia to living in a housing project", "can you explain to people what the catalyst for that was", "it was the parents i described to you", "i was really affected when i was at stanford by working in east palo alto", "it was literally \u2013 the contrast is just incredible", "for me, just literally, you cross these tracks into east palo alto", "especially at that time", "now you\u2019ve got a four seasons or whatever there", "it\u2019s gentrified in some ways", "but for me, i needed to get my haircut as a black guy", "there\u2019s no place on stanford\u2019s campus that\u2019s used to cutting black hair", "so my first time was just going to find a barber back when i had hair", "you and me both", "yeah, but then the summer of my freshman year, i started working a place called the onetta harris community center, which is technically east menlo park", "but it was a similar community", "i found such a connection with these kids", "i basically said, \u201cokay, this is my life work", "i want to work in cities.\u201d so i worked everywhere from east harlem to east palo alto", "when i was at yale, helping to run legal clinics", "i just felt a kinship and connection with what i thought my soul mission was, which was \u2013 when i say these words \u201cliberty and justice for all,\u201d \u2013 i always say to people, before you tell me about your religion, first show it to me in how you treat other people", "well, our civic gospel in this country, we all know the words to the declaration of independence, or at least we all know a lot of those words", "we know the words to our pledge", "we know the national anthem", "but those words actually have power and meaning", "it\u2019s just like a religious text that we read and then we go out on sunday and cut a driver off and flip him off or are we living with grace that christ, or whatever your religion is, commands", "i think we have a civic gospel as well", "we are pledging allegiance to the idea of liberty and justice for all", "but most americans don\u2019t know that we have a justice, that by its definition, treats you better if you\u2019re rich and guilty rather than poor and innocent", "because if you and i get arrested for the exact same crime, i\u2019m wealthier than you, you\u2019re a poor white guy from wherever you\u2019re from", "i can get out", "i can bail myself out, but you\u2019re stuck in the jail sometimes for months", "people don\u2019t realize this", "some people stay for months", "so if you really believe in that idea of liberty and justice for all, what did you do today to live that to the gospel", "so for me, and again, this is just for my own path", "what i saw was that i so benefitted from this country", "i didn\u2019t have \u2013 you interviewed people in the military", "which you and i are both wired this way that we see people in uniform and are just very drawn to them", "when you meet some of the guys you\u2019ve interviewed and see what they\u2019ve gone through and see what they\u2019ve done for this country, they have a level of sort of patriotic ideal that is lived in a way that i revere", "but i also have that same thing for people that take themselves out of their privilege and say, you know what", "i believe those words that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere and i\u2019m going to do whatever i can to commit myself", "you and i both have friends at teach for america", "you know what", "i\u2019m going to go off and make a lot of money, but for two years of my life, i\u2019m going to do the peace corps", "i going to do tfa", "i\u2019m going to do something", "anyway, i had all these ideals", "i think the challenge in all of us in our life is to try to live lives of the best integrity we can when we live in accordance to our ideals", "lo and behold, though, newark, new jersey flipped the script on me and basically said to me, you think you\u2019re here to serve", "i was 26 or 27 at the time", "you think you\u2019re coming here to serve, you think you\u2019re coming here to help, we\u2019re going to flip the script on you", "i always say i got my b.a", "from stanford but my ph.d", "on the streets of newark", "this actually leads me to the hunger strike, where i decided that i was going to move into the toughest area, literally as i\u2019m moving in", "was this before or after the city council", "no, i\u2019m a yale law student at the time", "oh, this is yale law school, got it", "yeah, i was a yale law student", "again, i\u2019d worked one summer in east harlem", "i\u2019m very much engaged in what i think are some of the frontiers of our democracy, but i\u2019d never really been a part of the community", "a lot of us \u2013 i would volunteer then i\u2019d go back to my dorm at yale", "i just said, you know what", "i want to live my life", "i want my professional life to be a part of a community", "here i am, i\u2019m a united states senator and i have the privilege of going back to one of the wealthiest community of all the senators to go back to", "the median income is $14,000 per individual, but i live in a community that blows me away", "every day, i see americans with a fealty to the ideals of this country literally in the grass roots or in the trenches of our fight for our democracy every single day", "i love when reporters or whoever wants to come, walk around my neighborhood and see great people who often are stereotyped or misunderstood because we wall ourselves in america", "we often don\u2019t cross these lines, unfortunately in our society", "long story short, i move onto the south end of martin luther king boulevard in newark", "literally as i\u2019m moving in, my big italian best friend from fourth grade, a guy named chris magaro, was helping me carry stuff in", "we come back to the car and my stuff is stolen", "welcome to the neighborhood", "yeah, welcome to the neighborhood", "unbeknownst to me, but the abandoned home \u2013 i shouldn\u2019t say this, i did actually know this at the time, but the abandoned home next to me is where you see, again, a real great cross-section of american life because drug addiction knows no race or socioeconomic status boundaries, so people are coming into this community to buy drugs", "i didn\u2019t realize \u2013 i\u2019ve now learned a lot more about the drug market, even than when i was mayor, because i went back to write a lot about this for my book", "i went back and interviewed drug dealers from the \u201890s", "but this was a hot place to sell drugs because one guy who was probably a guy that should\u2019ve been in corporate america", "he ran the drug operation in newark, just found a way to get cheap, high-quality product", "so i had moved into the middle of this not realizing that i was in probably one of the most violent drug markets", "i knew it was bad, but i didn\u2019t know it was as bad as it was", "when i went in and i actually interviewed this guy and some of the drug dealers, they had set things up in a way that i was with a person who was helping me record a lot of the interviews", "this is sounding like new jack city", "so i\u2019m in the middle of this", "i go with this arrogance to the tenant leader", "i\u2019m now living in the neighborhood", "i\u2019m thinking, ha ha, i\u2019m here", "i\u2019m riding in on my white horse, da, da, da", "newark is this amazing city that doesn\u2019t deal well with people \u2013 at least the attitude that i had at that point because ms", "virginia jones, the tenant president, looks at me when i\u2019m telling her how much i\u2019m going to help her", "she looks at me with this cynical, almost just like, i don\u2019t have time for this look", "she did this experiment with me where she takes me down to the middle of martin luther king boulevard", "again, i\u2019m this yale law student, i\u2019m here to help you", "she goes, \u201cwhat do you see?\u201d i go, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d she goes, \u201cwhat do you see in this neighborhood?\u201d i just describe it just the way i did to you, \u201ccrack house and drug operation.\u201d i described the neighborhood", "she just looks angry and she says, \u201cyou can\u2019t help me.\u201d she starts walking away", "i run after her", "i grab this woman from behind, very respectfully", "i say to her, \u201cwhat are you talking about", "i don\u2019t understand.\u201d she says to me words that changed my life", "she says to me, \u201cboy, you need to understand something", "the world you see outside of you is a reflection of what you have inside of you", "if you\u2019re one of these people who only sees darkness and despair, that\u2019s all there\u2019s ever going to be", "but if you\u2019re one of those stubborn people who every time you open your eyes, you see hope, opportunity, love, if you see the face of god, then you can be somebody who helps me.\u201d and she leaves me there sort of looking at my feet, thinking to myself, \u201cokay, grasshopper, thus endeth the lesson.\u201d i went back and i just was like, okay, \u201ci\u2019m here to learn", "i\u2019m not here to help", "i\u2019m here to learn.\u201d i sat on this woman\u2019s couch and watched what i just was in awe of", "people would come to see her with problems", "she would help people with rent, somebody needed a job", "she held this community \u2013 her son in the \u201880s, before i arrived, was murdered in the lobby of the building that i lived in, that i eventually would live in", "she and i were probably two of the people that were some of the highest income earners in there", "we could\u2019ve lived anywhere", "but she, literally after her son was murdered, stayed in those buildings, remained the tenant president, held that community together with the force of her will", "both buildings \u2013 i live in the neighborhood still, but those buildings aren\u2019t there anymore", "they still have a reunion every year", "think about this", "these were buildings when i lived in them for eight years, heat and hot water irregular, homeless people or worse, sometimes collapsed", "i\u2019d walk past people in the stairwells when the elevators weren\u2019t working wondering occasionally if someone was alive or not, trying to nudge them", "you\u2019d see feces in the hallways, mice", "i could tell you all the challenges of living in these buildings, but yet there was such a sense of community created there that still years later, the buildings are gone, and there\u2019s still a reunion being held", "the alumni from those buildings, because of the spirit in that community, go on to do incredible things", "i give, like i\u2019m sure you do, try to write checks at the end of the year to people who are doing great things", "one of them is a guy, a police officer from those buildings, who grew up in those buildings, who still does things", "i had gone into politics because \u2013 okay, so fast forward", "me and ms", "jones and other tenant leaders are taking on the slumlord who eventually got convicted in federal court, fighting noble battles", "but the residents in that building and a number of others are really frustrated that they don\u2019t think the city is being responsive to their concerns and needs", "there\u2019s talk about running somebody for city council", "it\u2019s one of those times where you\u2019re standing in a line, \u201cwho volunteers?\u201d and everybody steps backwards and you\u2019re the person", "before you know it, i\u2019m the candidate", "i won the central ward of newark", "which if you go visit me in my senate office, that\u2019s the map behind me that still sits there", "who got me into politics", "this place with an abundance of public housing, overwhelmingly black and latino", "folks who put their faith in me before they even knew me", "this was about a year after i moved into the neighborhood", "before i was even a known commodity, they said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take a risk on you.\u201d the reason why the hunger strike ended up is because i get elected and a year later, i am at the nadir, the lowest point of my professional life where i felt like a failure", "i wasn\u2019t getting anything done", "the mayor of the city, who was like, if i\u2019m just a novice in politics, if this is like my freshman year of high school as a first-year city councilperson, sharpe james \u2013 and anybody will tell you this in new jersey \u2013 he was the grand master", "i was a paduan jedi; he was a jedi \u2013 darth vader", "depending on your perspective", "let\u2019s give love to people", "but he was a jedi knight", "again, we\u2019re laughing and people here might not know it, but this period of my life was a documentary called \u201cstreet fight.\u201d it got nominated for an academy award", "it won the tribeca film festival for audience choice", "i always say ignominiously, now as a vegan, it lost to a movie called \u201cmarch of the penguins.\u201d so i always say i make an exception for penguin meat when i\u2019m eating", "but this was an interesting moment", "feathered sausages, as they\u2019re known", "as they\u2019re known", "you and i are going to get letters from the humane society", "you guys can all mail those to brian callan, the comedian", "he\u2019s the one that came up with it", "my first year, basically sharpe james is toying with me", "the headlines are still there because i pulled them to write this book, so i want to show people i\u2019m not making this up", "i was getting my car ticketed everywhere, when i parked in front of city hall with the other council people", "my phones were tapped", "this is something that sounds almost funny two decades later, but my phones were tapped", "i wasn\u2019t getting anything passed", "my own community was getting frustrated with me because we put all this effort into getting you elected", "so i\u2019m ready to quit", "i was more effective as a young, tenants\u2019 rights lawyer than i have been in elected office", "on my lowest day, one year later, the summer of 1999 \u2013 i\u2019d been elected in \u201998 \u2013 i\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end", "i\u2019d gained weight", "i go to bed most nights with pounding headaches", "i\u2019m stressed out of my gourd", "i feel like \u2013 people were warming me that the police were following me", "i think the mayor might have seen me as a future threat", "which was prescient for him", "so people warning me that the police are following me", "i\u2019m just scared", "i\u2019m feeling like a failure as a guy who so much of my life has been afraid of failure and now in the first steps of my professional career i\u2019m failing", "on the lowest day, when i\u2019m getting outvoted all the time on the city council for my great, brilliant ideas that people are supposed to bow down before", "i\u2019m being a jerk because it\u2019s one of the moments i admitted i was a self-righteous jerk to my fellow city council people", "i\u2019m supposed to find common ground with the past stuff", "so i\u2019m making all these mistakes", "i get a call from a tenant leader named elaine sewell at these other high-rise, low-income housing and she basically says to me, \u201cit\u2019s off the hook up here.\u201d i still remember the movie that summer was wild, wild west", "she\u2019s like it\u2019s the wild, wild west out here", "there was a horrible incident where security guards were attacked by some of the drug dealers in this open-air drug market underneath a \u2013 these buildings sat by highway 280 in new jersey", "so it\u2019s a place people drive by but never slow down to look, except to buy drugs, because it looked like a mcdonald\u2019s drive-thru", "people would line up to buy their drugs", "so the drug dealers controlled this area", "the security guards were undermining that", "they tried to light the guard booth on fire", "she\u2019s like, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d i\u2019m basically like, \u201ci can\u2019t do anything.\u201d i just professed impotency", "i said, \u201ci can\u2019t get anything done", "what do you expect me to do?\u201d she and i start yelling", "i\u2019m like, \u201ci can\u2019t even get the cops to stop ticketing my car", "how am i going to get them to come out there?\u201d she basically says to me like the worst thing she could to me", "this is not because of her, but it\u2019s just because i had a wound", "she\u2019s like, \u201cwhy did we elect you then at all if you can\u2019t do anything?\u201d i was done", "i lose my temper, raise my voice, hang up on her and now i storm home", "you don\u2019t have this problem, but i do", "it\u2019s one of my addictions", "all i want to do is get back to my apartment in brick towers and hang out with my two buddies, ben & jerry and just eat myself into a food coma and go to bed", "oh, i\u2019m familiar with the cookie dough mixture", "self-medication", "yes", "and so but unfortunately, i\u2019m walking past to get to my apartment, this woman, ms", "virginia jones", "this pain in my neck", "this righteous pain in my neck", "the tenant leader, who happens to be standing out in the courtyard", "i literally as i see her, i\u2019m not in the mood for you, ms", "jones", "i need to get back to my apartment and eat my dag-nab cookie dough ice cream, because they combined the two now", "as i try to walk past her grunting her hello like a falcon would like a mouse, she starts playing with me", "she says, \u201cdon\u2019t walk past me.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cwhy?\u201d i turn around and stop", "she read me right away and she\u2019s like, \u201ccome here and give ms", "jones a hug.\u201d i walk over and i give her the most insincere hug in the world", "like when you say you\u2019re still going to be friends with somebody after you break up with them", "it\u2019s just like yeah, yeah, yeah", "i try to turn around and she grabs me by the arm and she goes, \u201ctell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d i just got like angry", "i\u2019m like, \u201cyou want to know what\u2019s wrong", "you want to know what\u2019s wrong?\u201d and i vented on her, probably blaming her a little", "\u201cthis is not working", "i\u2019m in this office", "i\u2019m not getting anything done.\u201d it was like the cry me a river, woe is me speech", "then i ended with what\u2019s happening to elaine sewell in garden spires and literally said, \u201ci don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d i must have repeated \u201ci don\u2019t know what to do\u201d like three times", "finally, she looked like a lightning bolt had hit her", "she suddenly gets really excited", "she goes, \u201coh, my gosh!\u201d i stop like she erased my script and my pity party", "she\u2019s like, \u201ci know what you should do!\u201d i\u2019m like you know what", "this is a wise woman", "occasionally she pulls some amazing gem out", "i\u2019m thinking maybe she has hope for me", "i\u2019m like, \u201cwhat do i do?\u201d she goes, \u201ci know exactly what you should do.\u201d i go, \u201ci heard you", "what should i do?\u201d and then she repeats it", "\u201cyep, i know what you should do.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cms", "jones, i don\u2019t have time to play.\u201d enough foreplay, what\u2019s the plan", "yeah, so what\u2019s the plan", "and she looks at me, she leans in and she goes, \u201cyou should do,\u201d and i\u2019m like, \u201cyeah, yeah.\u201d she goes, \u201cyou should do something.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d and if my momma didn\u2019t raise me right, i probably would have said some wrong things to her", "i storm off to my building, elevator\u2019s not fricking working", "i climb 16 flights of stairs", "practically kick open my door", "plop down on my couch", "and if you walk into my office today, i still have the bhagava gita, the koran, the torah, the bible", "the bible\u2019s sitting next to me in my apartment", "i open it up and there\u2019s this passage that most christians know called \u201cif you have faith the size of a mustard size, you can move mountains.\u201d but the next passage, which i didn\u2019t know well at that point, says \u201csometimes you have to fast and pray.\u201d i just thought to myself, you know what, i had not", "i was too caught up in my drama, too caught up in my script, that i hadn\u2019t sort of surrendered myself with an open heart", "i decided i was going to fast", "then the ideas started flowing", "i could do something", "i said, \u201cyou know what", "i\u2019m not just going to fast, i\u2019m going to plop right down in the middle of the drug market and fast", "and i\u2019m not going to just fast and pray, i\u2019m going to get a tent.\u201d before you knew it, my mind just started kickstarting", "this is a problem most people don\u2019t understand is that despair or cynicism is the worst", "i think cynicism, just like despair, is a toxic spiritual state", "it gives you the inability to see faint hope amidst glaring problems", "but again, i\u2019m a person of faith", "i believe that we were made in the image of a creator and therefore one of our greatest gifts is to be creative", "to think of new opportunities", "but if you\u2019re so negative and so cynical about the world around you, you disempower yourself and not do something about it", "you\u2019re only going to see the problems and not any of the solutions", "right", "and you and i have both had conversations with somebody that\u2019s in that state", "they say they want help, but every time you bring up an idea, they just shoot it down", "because they\u2019re not open to the possibilities", "so long story short is go out there to garden spires", "we set up a big tent", "i apologize to elaine sewell", "literally, there might have been some hugging and crying between the two of us because we were such close friends", "i wouldn\u2019t have gotten elected without her", "then i do what politicians love doing \u2013 i called a press conference", "i just said, \u201cthis is the united states of america", "people shouldn\u2019t live in fear.\u201d i announced that i was going to stay on this pavement and fast as long as it took for something to change", "i invited people to pray with me", "first day, there were four of us praying and everything", "then i went to bed", "the first night was scary", "courageous people slept with me underneath it, in this, what used to be the drug dealers\u2019 territory", "people threw diapers on top of us", "it was a scary night", "but i woke up the next morning, and a bunch of correctional officers were there", "they said, hey, we saw you on the news", "you\u2019re not staying out here alone", "over ten days, the world came out", "there were community leaders", "newark has such a reservoir of strength and love", "people poured out", "but then people \u2013 a suburban mayor from west orange came out with his police officers", "hospitals started coming out and doing health screenings", "employers started coming out doing job fairs", "people were donating computers", "by the tenth day, the mayor of the city came out and it was so funny because he came out with prepared remarks", "he and i would fight bitterly later, but after ten days of fasting and praying, i looked at him differently", "i saw his humanity", "i saw that he was a guy", "we hugged", "i\u2019ll never forget", "my editor wanted me to write this part out because i\u2019ll forget", "smell is one of the most powerful triggers to memory", "i hugged him and i breathed deep as we were hugging", "i smelled him", "he smelled like a family member of mine", "i was at that point like a 30-year-old", "he was my father\u2019s age", "when i smelled him, it felt like older uncles and things like that", "we parted from our embrace, which became the front page of this section of the newspaper", "he put away his prepared remarks and turned and gave an incredible speech", "he made promises that he ultimately \u2013 like he was going to build a part in the area", "that stuff never happened", "but it was a beautiful moment", "the tent came down", "i always say that change never happens in an instant", "you know this even in your own life, changing your own life", "it\u2019s something you have to keep at and work at", "so the world didn\u2019t change", "but i always tell people, for me, it was one of the most powerful moments of my life", "because the problems at garden spires didn\u2019t go away", "it was something i worked on until eventually i became the mayor, built a park in the area and all this stuff", "the point i always try to tell people is the most powerful moment of the whole experience to me was the last prayer, where there were now from four or five people praying and shaking on the first day, now there were 100, 200 people", "there was everybody there", "i looked and said, \u201cthis is my america.\u201d there were white folks, black folks, latino folks, asian folks", "there were imams, rabbis, priests, ministers, young, old", "people when they started praying were praying in hebrew and arabic and spanish", "i was the weakest i\u2019d ever been after ten days of not eating, but you know this from fasting", "but i think it was also the circle", "i just felt such strength, such power, such energy like i\u2019d never felt before", "i felt like i was connecting to who we are as a country, that ideal of e pluribus unum, that when we all come together, nothing is impossible", "it was the most hopeful moment of my life at that point", "it also gave me a renewed sense of mission", "that if i could find ways with others to bring people together, we could blow away problems in this country and everybody could benefit", "i want to ask what you learned from that, because it seems to me, and i don\u2019t like when people put words in my mouth, so i don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but that you found an option when you thought there were no options, right", "yeah", "i\u2019d love to know what you learned from that and how it impacted maybe later decisions", "maybe i\u2019m making it too complicated", "what did you learn", "because to me, there are a couple takeaways", "i\u2019m taking notes, for those people who can\u2019t see me because you can\u2019t, it\u2019s audio", "i constantly take notes", "i\u2019m circling things, i\u2019m highlighting things", "that you also forced the mayor to respond", "yes", "because you were calling attention to something", "so if you couldn\u2019t go through official channels, you could use the court of public opinion to force his hand to respond, right", "yes", "i would just love to know what you learned from that experience that maybe became part of your repertoire or set of options later", "well, so this was my first experience with lessons that people have learned a lot through activism experience", "if you can bring attention to a problem \u2013 look, when martin luther king and james bevel and dorothy cotton were fighting bull connor, if they had tried to fight that battle alone, who knows what the outcome would\u2019ve been", "but he had the fire hoses, he had the dogs and all of that", "but by their ability to bring attention to the problem", "after their demonstrations, the story went viral back in the day where you didn\u2019t have social media, but you had the traditional media", "suddenly the soviet union is mocking our democracy because watching black kids get bit by dogs, people in iowa sitting there having their dinner and saying, oh, my gosh, look at the humanity of us all", "we all love each other or have reservoirs of love for each other that once we trigger each other\u2019s consciousness or expand each other\u2019s moral imagination, let\u2019s just say that, it activates us", "clearly, in new jersey, we set up this society unfortunately", "a lot of this was very bad policy, some of the very bigoted policy of redlining and decisions by the federal housing organizations to pack all this poverty in one area", "what is redlining", "redlining is where \u2013 it comes from literally what they did on maps", "they said okay, this is a black area and we\u2019re not going to give mortgages and loans to people", "we\u2019re going to devalue the neighborhoods there", "decisions made about zoning where we\u2019re going to let certain people live", "so you see some of these maps that are still around", "this is part of our history where at a time when people were starting to flee urban areas, it was a federal policy that enabled certain people to move out and get good value for their homes and the like, certain people not", "it was put on top of that were everything from restrictive covenants to real estate steering, which my family did", "think about this, and new jersey is a great example, as lots of states are", "if they decided instead of putting a whole bunch of public housing in one area, like thousands and thousands of units, what if we took every unit like at harrington park, you take four units of affordable housing", "we now know that poor kids, same poverty, poor kids in middleclass neighborhoods do so much better than when you concentrate all poor kids in poor neighborhoods", "and by the way, these were overt policies", "these were like, we cannot let black people out of neighborhoods", "what are we going to do to keep them in", "and so that created these ghettos that then became \u2013 well, where did the jobs go to", "they went outside of the communities", "where are the good schools", "because, remember, if everybody leaves the city, their ability to have a tax base to support the education system is not there", "and by the way, the tax base has now disappeared", "you can\u2019t even support police officers or everything so cities start tumbling downward", "then you create laws to keep people back", "i was shocked when i got to newark that surrounding suburbs with really great schools would actually hire people, private investigators, to say okay, there\u2019s a black kid going to these schools, let\u2019s follow them around to see where they go home to", "in fact, there\u2019s a woman, i just saw her again, last name martinez, who was a writer for the wall street journal education page", "her family used a fake address in a different neighborhood to get her kid to school", "they were caught", "she was pulled out of, ironically, a journalism class, and forced to go back", "it was a horrible situation", "a lot of people don\u2019t realize that a lot of these problems that exist today are not legacies to slavery", "these are legacies to the \u201850s, \u201860s, \u201870s, and \u201880s", "but they forget the other story of america, which is literally the creation of toxic zones in our nation", "so people don\u2019t understand", "when they flee these cities, corporate america was allowed for years to pollute those cities pretty badly", "in newark, i used to remind people, literally pollute", "now you\u2019re a kid growing up in an environment where you\u2019ve got lead paint, and we have epidemic levels in newark", "you and i both know, you don\u2019t even need to be lead poisoned, just elevated blood lead levels affect your brain where your executive function deteriorates", "yeah, your oxygen carrying capacity and all of that", "all of that", "but it\u2019s not just the lead paint", "the air \u2013 because now you\u2019ve created cities again, where did we choose to build highways and roads that the oxygen is so bad that you have asthma levels that are three and four times as high in urban areas", "it\u2019s not even done yet", "i remember when i wanted to try to get rid of the food deserts in newark; big campaign", "i just finally got a whole foods that we just opened", "we got supermarkets", "but we also said let\u2019s create urban agriculture", "we\u2019re going to create acres and acres of farms in newark, which we did successfully and have guys coming home from prison, men and women coming home from prison, jobs", "but we also said, wait a minute, we want to dig in the ground", "the state said, you can\u2019t dig in the soil", "it\u2019s got too much lead", "imagine this now", "your air quality, your soil quality", "what about the river that 100 years ago immigrants from ireland and you pick an area", "if you were poor, you could still go into the river and it was a commons, right", "you could get fish", "we had lots of clams and the like", "but now it is \u2013 i\u2019m not exaggerating this \u2013 it is literally a superfund poisoned with agent orange, all kinds of other dioxides from years of corporations despoiling the river", "literally stealing from future residents of newark and calling it profits in their present", "imagine this, you\u2019ve got schools that have deteriorated", "you\u2019ve got a physical environment that\u2019s toxic", "you have large concentrations of poverty and then you have something on top of that, which most americans don\u2019t realize, which i mentioned earlier, but let\u2019s just understand it, called the criminal justice system", "this is why i love from the coke brothers, to the heritage foundation on the right, to democrats like me, all agree because of this reality that i now know from my own experiences", "my friends in harrington park, new jersey and old tappan high school i went to \u2013 i hope they don\u2019t get mad at me for saying this \u2013 but we broke a lot of laws", "drug laws, friends of mine on senior cut day kicked open a liquor store that was closed", "they couldn\u2019t use their fake ids, so they stole cases of beer and got caught", "that\u2019s breaking and entering", "that\u2019s a felony", "very little consequence, besides our parents and others maybe getting upset", "but my friends and i have all gone one with our lives, raising families", "very different justice system for doing the exact same things to experience in many places in our community", "our criminal justice system is now overly targeted towards poor people", "at stanford, at princeton, nobody was getting stopped and frisked coming home", "by the way, if they did from a frat party, they would find drugs", "no fbi operation right now saying how are we going to get those college kids and break their drug ring", "when i know on college campuses, from adderall to x, you can get them, sometimes on a smartphone", "but in the inner city, those things become literally the difference between you making in life and you don\u2019t", "and in a nation where almost one in three adults now has an arrest record, for you and i right now, if we get arrested, we have the means with which it\u2019s not going to change our lives", "it might change my politics, but it won\u2019t change our lives", "the problem with inner cities, and i saw this when i went out to riker\u2019s island, if you get arrested, you can\u2019t even afford the bail", "i was out in riker\u2019s and these were kids missing six months to a year before they\u2019re even adjudicated", "there is a documentary jay z just did about kalief browder, who spent two years-plus in jail for stealing a backpack", "most people don\u2019t realize in jail what we do to kids", "other countries call it torture, which is solitary confinement", "talk about life experiments", "we\u2019ve heard about this", "there\u2019s a great guy you should interview who wrote an amazing book about what he did with trying to cope with being stuck in solitary", "but psychologists now conclude \u2013 in fact, over 50 percent of the suicides of juveniles in prisons are kids that were in solitary confinement", "over 60 percent, if you include kids that just got out of solitary confinement", "so now you have a criminal justice system that preys upon the poor", "and by the way, you and i are both guys of means, but in america right now, there\u2019s no difference \u2013 drug dealing and drug usage is sort of equal amongst races in america", "in fact, young white men have a little higher levels according to some studies, of dealing drugs", "but if you\u2019re black in america, you\u2019re going to be arrested for that usage 3.7 times more likely than someone who is white", "so now you get these poor areas, toxic physical environment, designed to be poor because of the compacting and public housing in those certain areas", "now you get a criminal justice system that is focused on them, not in my town where i grew up", "by the way, most americans don\u2019t know that if you get arrested in america, most states can legally discriminate against you", "i can deny you a job just because you have an arrest, even if you were cleared of the charges", "most people don\u2019t realize that fbi records are so bad that a large percentage of the fbi background checks come back wrong", "i think the majority of them come back wrong", "so you may have been cleared of your charges, but that employer, you don\u2019t even know they\u2019re looking at it, thinks you still had something wrong", "but the american bar association identified 40,000 collateral consequences if you have been convicted of a non-violent drug offense", "remember, two of the three last presidents, felony drug use they copped to, not just some pot, obama and bush \u2013 felony drug use", "there are presidents, a lot of congress people the same", "but if you\u2019re a kid in newark who got caught for a non-violent drug offense doing something stupid that we did, that stanford students and princeton students are doing, they can\u2019t get a pell grant, they can\u2019t get food stamps, they can\u2019t get business licenses", "i had a guy begging me when i was mayor of newark, \u201cwhy can\u2019t i get a cab license", "it was 18 years ago and i was just caught with a little bit of drugs.\u201d you can\u2019t get a job at burger king in newark", "i say all this \u2013 mind if i jump in", "oh no, go ahead", "the conclusion of all this is that\u2019s sort of what got me into fighting against a lot of stuff and finding like the concrete of garden spires where i did the hunger strike, learning that if i try to fight these battles without creating unusual coalitions \u2013 basically if i can create unusual coalitions, i can get unusual results", "if i can awaken people to the facts of what\u2019s going on, if i can appeal to people\u2019s moral imagination, i can tap into a tremendous amount of energy", "for newark, i had to hack the system", "in many ways, what i did with the hunger strike taught me that if i can think of ways to hack the system and get people to pay attention that weren\u2019t paying attention before, i can actually make tremendous things happen very quickly", "i became mayor at the worst time to be a mayor of an american city, during the great recession, which is a great depression", "i had a guy who was my friend, and i know i say that and some of my democrat friends get mad at me, but chris christie is my friend", "i can write a dissertation on our disagreements, but i said, \u201ci\u2019m the mayor of the largest city", "you\u2019re the governor of the biggest state", "let\u2019s not focus on where we disagree", "let\u2019s see if we can find some things we can work together on because if i don\u2019t, i\u2019m just going to be screaming at you from the outside, as opposed to sitting at the table with you and finding things that at least two americans can find six or seven things that we can work together on.\u201d just to pause \u2013 everybody should rewind that and listen to the exact wording of that five to ten times because it\u2019s useful", "my funniest chris christie story is \u2013 not funniest, but most instructive to me \u2013 was when the press got mad at me", "it was marriage equality", "gay marriage was being voted on", "something i\u2019m strident about; equal justice under the law", "chris christie is stridently against", "it\u2019s being voted on in the state senate in new jersey", "i had a meeting \u2013 i didn\u2019t plan it this way, but it was scheduled with chris christie in trenton in his office on the same day that all this was happening", "imagine this \u2013 protestors outside, media outside", "i\u2019m going in to meet with chris christie and everybody\u2019s thinking the first person who ever raised the pride flag in front of city hall in newark, the guy that refused to perform marriages when i was mayor because i\u2019m not going to marry anybody unless i can marry everybody, i\u2019m marching in to meet with chris christie and everybody\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, he\u2019s going in there to give chris christie hell.\u201d really i\u2019m marching in there with him because i was working on a $300 million project in downtown newark that had places for schools, and that had affordable housing", "i brought together an unusual coalition", "unions pledging to do apprenticeship programs for my kids, goldman sachs (god forbid) because they were one of the few that i could get to get capital for the project", "it was an amazing coalition to benefit my city, to create jobs and the like and he\u2019s critical to getting it done, so i\u2019m going in to meet with him", "i come out and the press it putting microphones in my face", "\u201cdid you give it to him on this?\u201d i\u2019m like, i could have sat there for my entire one hour i had with the governor of the state of new jersey and fought with him and we would\u2019ve changed neither of each other\u2019s minds", "but by focusing on something \u2013 and i\u2019m not saying there\u2019s not a time and place", "chris christie has not been soft on me on things he disagrees with", "he publicly criticizes me", "even when i\u2019m senator, he still publicly criticizes me on things", "i haven\u2019t been soft on him, but in that precious time i had with him, i wanted to get this dag-nab project done so i could get jobs for people who yesterday or the day before, they needed to go to work and that was what was important", "i\u2019m glad i didn\u2019t interrupt you", "sorry for attempting", "where i was going to go was exactly where you helped me segue, which is something that we chatted about very briefly before recording", "feel free to wordsmith this because i scribbled it down very quickly", "but we\u2019re becoming reactivists, not activists", "for people who listen, for instance, when you were talking about all of these various problems", "there are many people in this country, and certainly around the world, who feel overwhelmed, disempowered, like it\u2019s all just too much that they can\u2019t do anything", "then they become or they take on the cynicism that we already talked about as being very toxic and contagious also", "how would you suggest, if people care about a specific issue, they want to do good", "but let\u2019s say they have a full-time job", "what makes someone a good activist", "well, great question", "i\u2019m just trying to figure out how to approach this", "i guess there are two things that are bubbling up in me", "the first is again, life lessons that you and i have talked about in our past, but more you\u2019ve talked about", "i find that if every day i get up and can focus on and keep clarity on what the mission is", "what is my purpose today", "even back to the time, i credit my success in college from failure", "life does this to me a lot", "it beats me down to the basic elements of my being", "you and i have both probably been through that", "newark did that to me a lot", "i think from our brokenness \u2013 it\u2019s also necessary to be broken because that\u2019s often when the light gets in", "it\u2019s like when in our shining armor and stuff like that and nothing\u2019s penetrating", "but sometimes it takes us getting broken down", "my first brokenness in my post-18-year-old life was getting to stanford as this big hyped football player and failing", "sinking on the depth chart so the coach had to dig a little hole and write my name really low on the ground because that\u2019s how far on the depth chart i was", "just getting into a fight on the football field \u2013 i\u2019m not a fighter", "i\u2019m a guy that \u2013 fight meaning punch, punch", "oh, my god, yeah", "i went at it", "i always say this to kids, if you bump into somebody in a hallway and you\u2019re in a great mood, that\u2019s just a bump in the hallway", "but sometimes when you have a lot of anger and you bump into somebody, you take all the anger from all other areas of your life and you focus it on the person", "i was just feeling like a failure on the football field and anxious and nervous and fearful", "because you get there at stanford for football, you get there like around august and school doesn\u2019t start at stanford until like september or october", "i\u2019m fearing this reality that the truth is i was not the greatest student, not as great as kids i\u2019m with, these brainiacs", "i thought to myself, i\u2019m not competing on the football field and i\u2019m about to go in the classroom and just get my butt kicked by these smart kids from around the globe, who should be stanford students", "i\u2019m an imposter", "i got here as an over-hyped football player who\u2019s not good enough to compete in school", "i\u2019ll never forget the moment i really was contemplating leaving stanford before school even began and tucking tail and running", "i pulled out of my notebook a piece of paper and just clarified", "i basically put values down", "statements of who i am, what i stand for, and what i am trying to achieve", "the goals then became, and you can talk to my college roommate, who is still a dear friend", "i\u2019d have a whiteboard up, my entire college career", "in the dorm room", "in the dorm room", "i put it in code because i didn\u2019t want people to know what my goals were", "i have to ask \u2013 what would be an examination of a goal", "if you don\u2019t remember, you can make something up", "then what would the code say", "i\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t just like pig latin or something", "no, the code would be like i really wanted to transform my body", "some of the goals were very specific, like, i\u2019m going to weigh this much, i\u2019m going to run this 40 time, i\u2019m going to bench this much, and i\u2019m going to do everything i can to get to these numbers", "academically, it\u2019s the same thing", "i\u2019m taking this course load", "i\u2019m going to decide beforehand what grade i want to get and what i\u2019m willing to do to get to that grade", "what i found in college was this was a liberating experience because i realized if i was willing \u2013 and i have a good book in me", "if you ever want to co-write this book, how to get straight a\u2019s in college", "how to get straight a\u2019s in college if you\u2019re a dumb person, like i was", "sounds like a winning title", "because i just realized, you know this, everything\u2019s a hack, right", "everything is the strategy that you have", "forgive me, maya angelou; forgive me, alice walker", "i can\u2019t remember who said it", "there\u2019s a curse in it", "but i\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s alice walker", "this is the quote: \u201cif you want to fly, you\u2019ve got to give up the shit that holds you down.\u201d the power of that is that most of us want things, but we\u2019re not willing to give up something to get it", "what i learned in college that still serves me now is what am i willing to sacrifice", "am i willing to sacrifice", "in college for me, it wasn\u2019t a complicated life", "there wasn\u2019t anything i was willing to give up for the two things i wanted to excel in: academics and athletics", "once i realized that and really got it clear, then i could do it", "so what happened to me", "why did i become an a student when in high school i was a b student", "it\u2019s simple", "because when everybody else on thursday, friday and saturday nights were going to parties, i realized if i do what everybody else is doing, i\u2019m going to get the same results", "if you want things that other people don\u2019t have, you\u2019ve got to be willing to do the things that other people don\u2019t do", "i said i\u2019m going to go to the library for three or four hours", "i\u2019ll still go to the party at 11:00 or 12:00, but i\u2019m going to do things that other people aren\u2019t doing and study", "i\u2019m going to learn little hacks", "if the paper\u2019s due on the 7th, i\u2019m going to find out who\u2019s grading my paper and give them a rough draft on the 1st", "but really the 1st i give my best effort", "like this is the best thing i could put together, here", "i found out that the tas would say \u2013 i would say, here\u2019s some of my ideas, can you read this over and tell me if i\u2019m on the right track", "they would then tell me the pathway i needed to take to take that b paper to an a paper", "i could go through all of the things i did to come out of stanford and be qualified to get a rhodes scholarship", "but what i\u2019m saying to you, more importantly, going to this idea of activism, and i do this all the way, especially because in politics there are so many forces trying to erode your moral core", "i looked funny at my chief of staff because we just went through one of them on drug imports where we got publicly castigated", "we ended up getting to where we were in a place in accordance with our values for the right for importation of drugs from canada", "but if i didn\u2019t know my moral core before that, i would have veered way off course", "what college did for me was said focus in on what\u2019s important and cut everything else out and then find people who can teach you", "what i did there, and the joke i always say is, on the football field, there was a guy named jeff james, this great wide receiver", "i studied him", "he didn\u2019t know it, but i watched what he did", "i literally would begin copying the way he dressed to go out on the field", "like his towel was a

can talk to you about", "it was harder for me then", "i always look for a model", "what are they doing right", "what can i innovate upon that they\u2019re doing so i can find a way to do even better",

tim, i\u2019ll give this guy a shot.\u201d so this is a wonderful space that right and left are listening to", "let\u2019s just take it from people on my side of the aisle, who are so upset about trump right now", "one of the things that bothers me right now is because we don\u2019t understand that before trump, right or left, why were we so disturbed before this about the injustices in our country", "that superfund site in newark", "by the way, there are superfunds in every single state in the nation", "ronald reagan was one of the last presidents to re-authorize a cleanup mechanism",

sorry", "these are sites that are so profoundly toxic and dangerous, even living around them \u2013 and it\u2019s superfund", "super, f-u-n-d because we created, as congress, bipartisan, a fund to clean them up", "we said these are so toxic and dangerous, that we are going to take special legislation to clean these up", "god bless reagan for re-authorizing it, and god bless mitch mcconnell and others for voting for it", "now it\u2019s lapsed", "when i got into congress, this was a mission for me because new jersey is the no", "1 state in america for superfund sites", "north to south, and

controversial example, because we all like our bacon", "but north carolina has 9 million pigs", "why is that an important number", "pigs create ten times the excrement that a human being does", "so

back, and there\u2019s one of these places", "what they do is they put all the crap into lagoons", "just weeks ago, i went to stand with these people and try to figure out how i can help them", "then they take the excrement and they spray it in the air over what are empty fields", "but the problem is \u2013 and i stood there and watched \u2013 is the mist from that stuff floats off the property of

just because someone says they\u2019re a republican, you call them a \u201cracist,\u201d whatever, whatever, whatever, then you are not honoring the vision that this country was founded upon about the irrational commitment", "a team of rivals, right", "yes", "governor christie, i use him as an example and i apologize if he\u2019s a big listener to this, because i went to go vote in 2008 for barack

hugged the woman behind the table because she looks lonely", "then the results come out", "chris christie narrowly wins that election", "i look at the data", "if just the cities in new jersey had turned out a fraction of what they did a year before \u2013 then people are complaining to me", "i told you, i\u2019m mayor during the most difficult hand of cards", "i\u2019ve got a republican governor who is now cutting back on funding", "again, new jersey as a state had terrible problems", "he just said, \u201ci\u2019m not going to fund cities like i used to.\u201d trenton cuts off a third of their police department", "i lay off 12 percent", "then we see the earned income tax credit, which is a way for working americans making $30,000, $40,000 a year to get tax breaks", "he ends that system", "he cuts funding to planned parenthood which, again, different people on this recording might have different views on it, but for newark, it was one of the best ways for people to get access to preventative care and prevent unplanned pregnancies", "people were saying, \u201cwhy is chris christie doing this to us?\u201d my response to them is, \u201cchris christie is not doing this to you", "what\u2019s happening is we didn\u2019t come out and vote.\u201d what people don\u2019t understand, and king said this, again, nobody\u2019s evil here, but he said that the problem we\u2019ll have to repent in our day and age is not the vitriolic words and violent actions of the bad people, but the appalling silence and inaction of the good people", "can i jump in for a second here", "jump in, yeah", "all right", "if you were providing a cheat sheet to people listening, maybe, and almost certainly people in the carolinas were thinking, my god, that\u2019s terrible",

you were providing, aside from ensuring that you vote on the things that you claim are of importance to you, what else, if you had a training school for super activists, what would some of the tenets be", "that\u2019s the point i guess i was trying to make with some of my earlier comments to you, which is the same point over and over again", "it\u2019s this idea that ms", "jones said", "i was overwhelmed", "i didn\u2019t know what to do", "she didn\u2019t prescribe things", "she said, \u201cdo something.\u201d the problem is, we often let things feel so big, we allow our inability to do everything to undermine our determination to do something", "what people don\u2019t get is that you and i, and i know a little bit about your family history", "you just heard a bit about mine", "what

going to give him a dollar to go to school.\u201d that act of love literally had a time/space jump that i am sitting here right now because a small group of small, north carolina folks in the mountains decided that i can\u2019t change the world, but i can do one thing for one kid", "there\u2019s a united states senator where he is today because of those acts", "not one action done in a righteous cause", "look at people who are hacking our politics", "money is one of the most toxic influences on our politics, yet you just watched bernie sanders run a campaign where he didn\u2019t ask for one corporate dollar", "not because somebody said i only have $5 to give somebody", "i believe in that candidate, i\u2019m going to give $5 to them", "well, all those small actions in the aggregate turned into a tidal wave of action", "you and i, i don\u2019t know about you, but i get appeals for money a lot", "if i can\u2019t help, i at least give a dollar or $5 to show i care about this issue and it\u2019s something important", "that\u2019s my hope for anybody listening", "don\u2019t feel powerless ever", "alice walker says the most common way people give up their power is

going on there", "but i can\u2019t get mad at other people for not knowing what\u2019s happening in yemen", "but if i say i\u2019m going to one thing", "on my facebook page, i\u2019m going to post a little bit more about the near-famine going on in yemen", "i\u2019m going to give people one instruction of an action they can take", "if we were all doing that about issues we care about, we would be influencing each other", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m just saying is i\u2019ve learned in my life, again, i got a little cut off, but if you\u2019re an activist or if you\u2019re a person, what is your life mission statement", "why is that not clear", "what do you stand for", "i don\u2019t care if your mission is to go out and make $1 billion", "are you getting up every single day and at least knowing what your mission is, what your values are and how you\u2019re going to fight the good fight as you know it", "are you living in allegiance to that", "that\u2019s why i always say that\u2019s civic gospel", "before you tell me about your religion, show it to me in how you treat other people", "how are you living in accordance to those values that you hold that you intellectually have and be that kind of activist", "[don\u2019t suddenly \u2013 and i\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with suddenly waking up and saying i reject what\u2019s going on, but try to be consistent

what you just said", "perhaps it\u2019s the word that scares people, \u201cactivist\u201d or \u201cactivism,\u201d because it sounds like a full-time job", "if we were to maybe just call it being a good person as you define it in accordance with your values and so on", "that you could look at it almost like a behavioral change of any type", "if i\u2019m trying to get someone to change their diet, to take exercise as a new habit, i\u2019m going to want them to do less than they think they can do so they can build momentum in doing very small things", "so no, it\u2019s not going to be the gym for five days a week an hour at a time", "it\u2019s going to be five minutes in the gym twice a week", "anything beyond that is bonus credit", "diet", "great", "fixed your breakfast", "everything else you can keep the same", "so they build momentum", "the challenge that maybe i would issue to people listening is if it seems too big, keep ratcheting it down until it seems easy and then just make that your 30 minutes of being a good person for the week and put it in the calendar for a week from now", "that could be donating $5, $10 to a classroom on donorschoose.com in the town where you grew up", "it could be educating yourself for 15 minutes on a site like questbridge, which is another incredible, educational non-profit i\u2019m involved with", "make it small enough so that it\u2019s not intimidating, so it\u2019s easy", "that\u2019s the gift you gave me back in 2009 when you told me about working out", "i think about you \u2013 and again, i feel like this is like i have little fan boy moments with you", "but there are days i can\u2019t work out and i say to myself, tim told me just raise your heart rate for 12 minutes", "so from my home where i live in the capitol to the senate office building is a little over a mile", "i don\u2019t have to sprint it", "i\u2019m telling everybody right now", "it\u2019s embarrassing", "but it\u2019s about a 12-minute run for me",

say at least i\u2019m going to get 12 minutes in", "i\u2019m telling you right now, when it comes to being an activist, it\u2019s even as simple as this", "i really believe that there should be more people being mentors in this world", "i can\u2019t be a mentor myself, but i am going to once a week on social media post the link to big brothers and big sisters", "somebody, one of your circle of friends \u2013 if you have more than 100 followers \u2013 is one day \u2013 and if you post the data, you and i love data, about one mentor in a kid\u2019s life dramatically changes their life outcomes", "if one person in the next month that you do that or two months that you do that once a week or whatever, one person is a mentor, you\u2019ve just helped to change somebody\u2019s life",

don\u2019t do because we don\u2019t understand", "with this power, i\u2019m holding up my smartphone right now, that we have to connect to people", "i found this out as a political scientist, that more powerful than one of my political ads trying to get somebody to do something is someone posting information to their friends", "it affects behavior more than we know", "so just a few very quick closing questions because we could talk for hours and hours and hours", "maybe we\u2019ll be able to do a round\u00a02, because i know we have a lot of listener questions", "some of which were really fantastic", "i apologize to people that we\u2019re not going to get to delegating today", "we will get to it some other time hopefully", "but what are some books that you have gifted the most to other people", "i have gifted your book a lot", "it wasn\u2019t the 4-hour workweek", "the book of yours that i gifted to anyone was the 4-hour body", "i just thought there were so many great little hacks in there", "some of them rated r", "yes, yes, it is not all family programming, folks", "no, it is not all family", "as i realized as i was handing to a teenager", "well, that\u2019s why it was taken out of costco", "because it also apparently is printed in such a way that it flips open to some pretty explicit diagrams", "so for those who enjoy adult recreation, but fair warning", "maybe i shouldn\u2019t even waste my time because most of the good folks who listen to you probably have already listened to that", "look, i thought just mercy, this book written by one of the greatest american heroes that i know, a guy named bryan stevenson, who is a death penalty defender", "i try to consume as much as i can, so i do a lot of listening to books", "that was one of the biggest books that i handed out", "just mercy", "just mercy, back in 2015", "it is a beautiful listen", "it\u2019s one of those books that is a really good story", "it takes you out of where you probably are and

loved", "a buddy of mine wrote this book, and just for men and women that just want to work out a lot", "the book about living with a navy seal", "do you know what book i\u2019m talking about", "you know, i do know of the book and i\u2019m blanking on the title", "living with a seal, that\u2019s what it is", "it\u2019s jesse itzler", "if you are a workout guy, it reminds you of things you already know", "that you can push your body and yourself far further than you think", "i think i listened to that around the time i was starting to battle back into shape from being the heaviest i ever was",

into \u2013 in this context, we were deciding whether to do an interview that is kind of a quirky request that we got", "it was so easy for me to fall back on why am i here in the senate", "what is my mission", "i do really think that\u2019s a really productive thing", "if you have an hour just to sit with an open notebook and just say, what am i about", "what do i stand for", "what are most

off \u2013 if you\u2019re ticking off both sides of the political aisle, you\u2019re probably doing pretty good", "but we had this conversation because i love, again, i love talking about things from a spiritual perspective, but i\u2019m now finding that science and religion are really \u2013 the frontiers of science really are very spiritual", "so in astrophysics, i wanted him to confirm this with me", "i was using it in major speeches, talking about stars are millions, if not hundreds of millions of light years away", "that\u2019s what i wanted to confirm with him", "i had always heard that we\u2019re looking at stars at night that have disappeared, but because their light goes on in perpetuity, we see those stars as if they\u2019re there, but they\u2019re really gone", "he confirmed all of that", "i said that\u2019s powerful that a being of energy could be gone millions of years ago, but we\u2019re still basking in its light, marveling at its glory, feeling its warmth",

both been to them \u2013 whether dorm meetings, whatever", "everybody wants their moment and they speak for too long", "but i watched this guy just look at everybody with these eyes that he was listening to you", "while i\u2019m getting nudging and tired, he\u2019s still looking at people", "the irony of his sight was that he went blind", "yet, he would tease me every time i\u2019d see him", "i\u2019d say, \u201chey, frank, it\u2019s cory.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201ci see you.\u201d anyway, i want to end with my request to everyone", "and i\u2019m foreshadowing what i hope to share with some of the students who i\u2019m going to speak to in a commencement speech in a couple months", "his last words to me were \u2013 i walk into his room and he\u2019s in hospice", "my ego, which i need to check, is upset", "i\u2019m like, this guy, tens of thousands of human beings had heat and hot water or stayed in their homes because of him", "why is he dying without crowds of people", "this guy taught me that significance is more important than celebrity", "that purpose is more important than popularity", "he lived a life of great purpose and great significance", "i go into his hospice room after the nurses have told me that it\u2019s not going to be long", "he can barely talk", "i hope many people have not heard people towards the end of their lives", "i saw this with my father and others", "your breath gets really short", "but yet he was aware enough to know that i came in the room and i announced myself and he forces out these words that used to be what he used to always tease me with", "i go, \u201chey, frank, it\u2019s cory.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201ci see you.\u201d i spent time with him, i hugged him and kissed him on the forehead right before i left", "i said to him, \u201ci love you, frank.\u201d his last words to me were, \u201ci love you.\u201d i think about that", "\u201ci see you,\u201d \u201ci love you.\u201d \u201ci see you, i love you.\u201d we have lost our way in a sense in america, or at least many of us", "maybe i\u2019ll implicate myself", "that we think the highest calling of this country is tolerance", "we\u2019re a nation of tolerance as if that\u2019s a good thing", "but tolerance says if you disappear off the face of the earth, if you\u2019re that person at that party and you just disappear, we\u2019d be better off or i wouldn\u2019t be worse off because i was just tolerating you", "but this country, as our founders said in the declaration of independence, pledging to each other an irrational commitment, this country says, we were not called for tolerance, we were called for love", "to move beyond tolerate to that because love always see worth, sees dignity, sees value in the other person and knows actually that if your kids do well, if your kids become an entrepreneur or an artist or a teacher, my kids are going to benefit from that", "that is what makes a great society", "we cannot tolerate each other", "we cannot tolerate divisions", "we have to find ways to stitch this country together with love", "so my request to everybody listening is you can be fervently against a republican", "you can be fervently against a democrat", "you can be fervently against those people who are marching in the streets or what have you", "my request is that we all try to, all of us, including me, starting with me, try to see each other, our humanity, our dignity, and try to love each other", "i see you, i love you", "love demands a surrender of ego for a little while", "it demands a courageous empathy, as we\u2019ve talked about", "it demands a surrendering of your position", "not always, but for a moment, let me imagine what it is like to be you", "love demands you learning about somebody else", "i love my irish-american colleagues or my jewish-american colleagues", "have i taken the time to learn about the irish experience in america", "which is one of the great stories of america", "the japanese-american experience", "what a great story of america", "have i learned about you so this idea that people always say the biblical sense of \u201cknowing each other.\u201d but love, not eros love, but agape love necessitates knowledge, knowing one another as well", "i guess that\u2019s a long-winded way of saying my request for all of us, for people that you think you disagree with, take time to see them and to feel in your heart a love that americans should feel for each other", "you don\u2019t have to agree with each other", "always like each other", "but do you sincerely believe that patriotism obliges you to love americans", "if it does, then really try to love, which is not a being word, it\u2019s an active word", "it necessitates us acting towards our neighbor with a certain level of commitment", "i think that\u2019s the perfect place to end", "cory, thank you so much for taking the time", "thank you", "i\u2019m blown away that you would have me on", "well, it\u2019s great to see you again and i hope that we don\u2019t go as long before the next time we see each other", "thank you again", "i really appreciate the entire team making time", "thank you", "i\u2019ll say this one more time", "you are one of the sources of inspiration in my life and more than just inspiration \u2013 education", "i\u2019ve learned a lot from you as a guy", "i see you as a peer, but in many ways, you are one of the teachers of my life and i appreciate you, professor ferriss", "thank you", "thank you, cory", "well, you said you were a paduan at one point earlier", "i think you\u2019re definitely in that teacher role and certainly in that leadership role", "this is a conversation i hope we can continue", "for everybody listening, as always, you can find the show notes for this episode, links to all of the books, documentaries and many other things mentioned at tim.blog/podcast", "you can find links to the show notes for all other episodes there", "until next time, thank you for listening"]}
