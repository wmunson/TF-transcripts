about that in a few short episodes with chris sacca, but in the meantime, i am so excited to present an episode that was very, very physically demanding, and this conversation that you are about to listen to is with none other than rick rubin. and, if you don't recognize that name, well, the bio could seem almost fabricated, it is so impressive. so, he has been called the most important producer, that's music producer, of the last 20 years by mtv.   and, in 2007, he appeared on time's 100 most influential people in the world list. why would he appear on such a list? well, if you can imagine, say in the book world, that you named every author you could think of, off the top of your head, all the name brand folks, and then found out that one agent and one editor were responsible for all of them. you'd be dumbfounded. and, that's pretty much the case, when you look at the discography of rick rubin.   so, he was the former co-president of columbia records, he was the co-founder, along with russell simmons, of def jam records, and helped to popularize hiphop music, by working with the beastie boys, ll cool j, public enemy, run-dmc, for instanceand, i'm not gonna give the whole list, because it's too long, but here are just some of the artists that he has worked with: red hot chili peppers, beastie boys, which i already mentioned, slayer, johnny cash, jay-z, he appeared in the 99 problems video, danzig, dixie chicks, tom petty and the heartbreakers, slipknot, metallica, ac/dc, aerosmith, linkin park, weezer, the cultneil diamond.   mick jagger, system of a down, it goes on and on and on, and the genres span everything from lady gaga to zz top to shakira, to everything in between. kanye west, eminem, you name it. so, he's a fascinating guy. very much a zen monk in his temperament, and i've gotten to know rick over the last few years, and he insisted that we do the podcast in his sauna.iwhich is a barrel sauna, that makes your head melt, it is so intenseso, this was a very challenging episode, i hope you get some laughs out of it, and what you will realize very quickly is, you have to listen very intently to rick's answers. so, rick has sort of layers behind layers, behind layers. so, he'll tell you something, and you'll be like, i'm not sure i get that. and then, months later, it'll dawn on you, oh my god, there are so many different depths to that answer, i didn't pick up on it the first time around. so, you will have to interpret and ponder a lot of what rick brings up, but i hope you enjoy this. i enjoyed it, even though i almost got heatstroke, and, without further ado, here is rick rubin.   whoa, well almost without further ado. folks, one more ado. i forgot to mention, if you are interested in music, be sure to check out the drumming episode of the tim ferriss experiment, it's my tv show, it's been the no. one tv season on itunes now for some time, amazingly. but, if you go to itunes.com/timferriss, two r's, two s's, you can see a bunch of bonus footage, all of the episodesincluding the drumming episode.   where i am trained by stewart copeland, the founding drummer of the police, widely considered one of the top 10 drummers of all time, his teaching method resembles doc from back to the future, it is an amazing experience. and, i only had a few days, with a gun against my head, to train to then play to a sold out auditorium to play as the drummer for foreigner, which was nervous breakdown inducing to say the least.   so, you can check it out, itunes.com/timferriss, two r's and two s's, and now, here is rick rubin. rick, welcome to the show.  rick rubin: thanks for having me  tim ferriss: and, this setting is somewhat unique, and i've been looking forward to it/dreading it, ever since you first mentioned it to mewhere are we right now?  rick rubin: we are sitting in a sauna.  tim ferriss: we are sitting in a very hot barrel sauna, and i was told that was one of the conditions for having this conversation.   and, it's such an impressive barrel sauna, it's indoors, that i wanted to get the specs for it when i first saw it. and, you have a heater that must be, what, four times the size of a conventional heater from off the shelf that would go into one of these -! rick rubin: yeah, it's a much bigger heater than for the size of the room we're in.  tim ferriss: and, i'm sitting on the floor, because i have such limited confidence in my ability to withstand heat compared to you. but, we do have the alternate, which is the bath just outside of this doorand, you and i have gone back and forth many times of course, with this type of cycling, but what is right outside this door?  rick rubin: a metal tub, filled with ice   tim ferriss: it is a metal tub, about four feet, three and a half feet off the ground, full of ice. it looks like, if you were to say, a horse trough times two, something like that?  rick rubin: something like that.  tim ferriss: it's gotta be maximum low 50's, something like that?  rick rubin: i think it's about, today, it's probably about 38 degrees.  tim ferriss: oh, my god, okay, so, we have two mics on the floor, i'm hoping won't explode.   or melt down, the h4 and the h6, and we have water, ice, heat, nothing could go wrong. i'm looking forward to it. so, rick, i was hoping we could start with a discussion of your physical transformation. and, i'd love for you to kind of describe to people - i mean, you're the picture of, in my mind, fitness in a lot of ways, now, and we've been paddleboarding before, and you always summarily whoop my ass, i'm always impressed. there are a lot of things contributing to my lack of competency and fear there. but, where were you, and how did you end up undergoing this physical transformation?   because you've lost how much weight, at this point? how much fat, would you say?  rick rubin: i lost, at the peak moment, i lost between 135 and 140 poundsand, i always thought i was eating a healthy diet.   i was vegan for 20-something years. and, all organic, vegan, really very strict with what i ate. and, doing that, i got up to 318 pounds, and i read a book by a guy named stu middleman, who ran 1,000 miles in 11 days, and i remember reading that, and thinking wow, i can barely walk down the block, and this guy ran 1,000 miles in 11 days, and it just seemed so inspiring. so, i read his book, and in the book, he talked about a guy named phil mafetone, who i'd never heard of.  but, he got to this part in the books where he talks about, i met this doctor named phil mafetone, and he changed the way i trained, and he changed the way i ate, and he changed all these things, and then all of the sudden, i was able to do all of these things. it's like, okay, i wanna find phil mafetone so, i found him online, i sent him an email.   and, he was living in florida, and i asked if i could become his patient. and, he said that he had just stopped treating patients, and retired from being a doctor. well, that's terrible news. but, the reason that he retired from being a doctor was, he decided to become a songwriter. i said, oh, that's interesting -  tim ferriss: funny you should mention that.  rick rubin: yeah, i'm involved in songwriting and the music world, maybe we can trade. maybe i can help you with your songwriting, maybe you can help me with my health and fitness. and, he liked the idea, and we ended up meeting a few months later, and met several times, and became friends, and he eventually ended up moving into my house, and lived in my house for about two years. and, i did everything he said, and i got much healthier, my metabolism got turned on, the hours that i was sleeping shifted.   i - for most of my life, i stayed up all night, and slept most of the day. and, when i was in college, i never took a class before 3:00pm, because i knew i wouldn't go.  tim ferriss: and, this was at nyu?  rick rubin: nyu. so, i'm used to living a night lifestyle, even in high school. i remember, i missed the first three classes of school so many times, that it was really an issue. but, i'd learned to be up all night, i'd learned to be a late-night person. and, it kinda suited the music life, like, it worked well with my life. and, one of the first things that phil suggested when we got together was, i slept with blackout blinds. and i usually didn't leave the house until the sun was setting. and, he said, from now on, when you wake up, i want you to go outside. as soon as you wake up, open the blinds, and go outside, naked if possible, and be in the sun for 20 minutes.   and, when he said it, i remember thinking, it'd be the same as if he said, i want you to jump off this ledge. it'd be the most terrifying, based on the way i live my life, that just sounded terrible. tim ferriss: right. what time was he recommending that you wake up? rick rubin: well, by the time we started, it kept moving down, and it went from 3:00 to probably noon, to 11:00, to 9:00. and, it just sorta happened naturally, and he knew that if i immediately went in the sun, that naturally, my body would start wanting to wake up earlier, and going to sleep earlier. it was the first time ever that my circadian rhythm was kicking in.  it never was - i never knew that there was such a thing, or knew what that was. so, he got me to connect to that   and, i did everything he said, changed my diet. started eating some animal protein, i was, as i said, a devout vegan, so eggs and fish were the first things i would eat. and, even then, i never liked eggs, and i never liked fish, so i ate them more like medicine. and, slowly, i got healthier and healthier and healthier, and more and more fit, but i was still very heavy, and i was heavy for a long time.  tim ferriss: what age were you when you brought him into your house? or how long ago was this?  rick rubin: i'm gonna guess i was probably late 30's  tim ferriss: and, how old are you, if you don't mind me asking, how old are you?  rick rubin: yeah, it was about 10 years ago, 10, 12 years agosomething like that.  tim ferriss: so, you were changing your diet. what were some of the other things that he had you change?  rick rubin: he had me do 20 minutes of low heart rate exercise, aerobic activity, every day, and he had me start wearing a heartrate monitor. and, my heartrate, i would get into - for me, walking up a flight of stairs would be an aerobic activity. so, i had to really watch what i was doing, to stay - sorry, anaerobic activity, yeah. i had to work hard to stay in the anaerobic space.  tim ferriss: the aerobic space, you mean.  rick rubin: yeah, the aerobic space. it's getting hot in here.  tim ferriss: yeah, it is getting hot in here. time to take off all your clothes.  rick rubin: my hand's burning the mic.  tim ferriss: i tried to wrap them in napkins, i remember you did mention, those might get hot. sorry, so to stay in the aerobic threshold, you had to work very hard  rick rubin: yes. and, again, my health changed, but i still stayed very heavy.   and, after two years of time, i probably lost a little bit of weight, but not much. but, i was much healthier, and much more alive, and much better than i was before and, after that period of time, phil said to me, you know, anyone else who made the changes you made, out of everyone he's ever dealt with, 99 percent, out of 100 people, 99 out of 100 people would have dropped all their weightfor some reason, there's something else going on with you, that's holding onto the weight. so, i kinda of just accepted that that was how it was.   but, at least i felt a lot better, my life was a lot better at the end of the day. i was a lot happier. and then, a mentor of mine, whose name is mo ostin, he was a guy who ran warner bros. records for 35 years, he worked for frank sinatra.   real inspiring guy in the music business. he suggested - i went out for lunch with him one day, and he said, rick, i'm real worried about you, i know you watch what you eat, and i know that you walk on the beach every day, and you exercise, but you're really getting big, and i'm getting worried, so, he said, i'm gonna get the name of a nutritionist, and i want you to go to my guy, and i want you to do whatever he says. and, i said, okay, fine. and, i knew it wouldn't work, because i knew that my whole life, i had a weight problem, my whole life, i've tried every diet, and nothing ever worked. but, i would do anything for mo.   so, i went, again, open-minded, but not believing it would workwilling to try, but not believing it would work. and, the nutritionist put me on a high protein, low calorie diet, and i'd never done a low calorie diet before, and, over 14 months, i lost 130 pounds, 135 pounds.  tim ferriss: wow  rick rubin: yeah, and that changed everything, and i will say, if i didn't do the work with phil first, i don't believe that the diet would've worked it was sort of like a combination of things in order. it was like, the metabolism got turned on, i started being in tune with circadian rhythm, i was stimulating my aerobic system every day. i built a base, and then, with the right diet, was able to drop the weight quickly  tim ferriss: what's so interesting about that, and i have a couple more questions about what the nutritionist prescribed, but in my experience, with say tens of thousands of readers, following various diets, including this low-carb diet, it makes perfect sense, because you're adding things in, in the beginning, as opposed to having everything prohibited,   and, you're adding elements in, and then, once you've added those lifestyle components, at that point, you're able to change the diet, and then, experience the - wow, that is hot.  rick rubin: it is hot, i was gonna say, even with phil, though, i changed my diet, it just was - you know, almond butter was something that i was allowed to eat, because in phil's world, almond butter is healthy. so, i probably ate two thirds of a jar of almond butter every day  tim ferriss: that's my issue with things like almond butter, domino foods.  rick rubin: exactly. phil has a belief, and so many people have a belief that calories don't count, and i understand that. but, if you eat 10,000 calories a day -  tim ferriss: right.  rick rubin: you're probably gonna gain weight, you're not gonna lose weight.  tim ferriss: exactly.  rick rubin: so, it's like, there is a point, where calories do make a difference  tim ferriss: oh, absolutely if it's a question of between 4,500, and 5,000 calories, like, okay, yes, bourbon calories, sugar calories and fat calories are very different.   but, if you're eating 10,000 calories of almond butter before you go to bed, which i will do, if i have almond butter in my house, then best not to have it in my house. so, when you lost the 130, 140 pounds, over that period of time, how many meals were you eating per day, and how many of them were whole food versus liquid?  rick rubin: to lose the weight, i was having seven protein shakes a day, that were high protein, they were like, egg protein, j-rob egg protein was one of them. terra's whey, whey protein was another.  tim ferriss: did you alternate those, or combine them?  rick rubin: no, at first, i did only egg, and then the whey came later. and, at first, i couldn't tolerate the whey, for some reason, the whey made me uncomfortable, once i lost a bunch of weight, i could eat the whey. so, egg was first.  tim ferriss: that also makes sense, i mean, having any amount of dairy or lactose reintroduced, after being vegan for such a long period of time. a lot of people i've noticed who try to reintroduce animal proteins feel sick, but it's because they lack the enzymes, at that point, after say ten years of not consuming meat, to digest it properly  rick rubin: do you wanna do an ice round, or do you want me to do an ice round? because i feel like i'm getting close.  tim ferriss: yeah, i'd say, why don't you do an ice round, because you're at higher elevation. i'm sitting on the floor, for those people who can't see. yeah, this is no joke.  rick rubin: it's not even 200.  tim ferriss: it's not even 200, it's about 190 - holy crap, 195 degrees in herealright, so -  rick rubin: but, hopefully, it'll get up to about 220  tim ferriss: oh, good lord, 220, that's a well done steak right there, that's very well done. alright.   i will hang out in here, and i will see you out there in a minute. i'm holding both mics now, sitting on the floor, two containers of water, and i have a russian spa hat on, they make you look somewhat like keebler elves, and mine has a lion on it. and, i have to only guess that the cyrillic says spa lion, which is appropriate, because i think of myself as a spa lion. on a related note, folks, if i do die of heatstroke, it's been lovely knowing you, and i'm going to press stop now, to save my breath for the ice round.iand, we're back. refreshed after some - i think we're getting colder, adding ice, but it was about 44 degrees fahrenheit. so, rick, you had mentioned this gent, or lady, or doctor from uclawho was that?  rick rubin: the doctor at ucla, who helped me lose the weight was dr. heber, h, e, b, e, r. and, he's really, of everything i tried, nothing ever worked, until dr. heber.  tim ferriss: and, do you still follow the general diet, or have you been able to, after losing that weight, modify that?  rick rubin: i've modified it, in that i still eat a lot of protein, and don't have any grain. yeah, really no carbs, and i keep - while i probably don't restrict calories as much as i did in the weight loss phase, i'm aware of it. i'm aware of them, and don't let them get out of control,  tim ferriss: right, you've developed a sensitivity, or an awareness.  rick rubin: right. and, for a period of time, i used an app, i think it was called fitness pal, if i can remember correctly, where you put in all the food you eat, and it tells you the calories, and just kinda keep a log,   and, what was just kinda helpful about it was, if you pay attention to calories for, let's say a year, you then really have a sense of where the calories are hidden, and you just have better habits   tim ferriss: absolutely. if you're trying to get into say, ketosis, or following something like the atkins diet, for instance, you develop a sensitivity to hidden sugars and carbs.  rick rubin: absolutely.  tim ferriss: and sort of net carbohydrates. so, i'd love to sort of shift gears a little bit, and ask you about music producing. let's perhaps take even a step back, and ask, when people ask you what you do, how do you answer that question?  rick rubin: i don't know how to answer that question.  tim ferriss: you don't know how to answer?  rick rubin: no.tim ferriss: so, what does a - let's perhaps start with definitions then. what does a music producer do, for those who don't know what -  rick rubin: well, i don't know what music producers do  tim ferriss: okay.  rick rubin: i can tell you what i do.  tim ferriss: okay, let's do that  rick rubin: which is, i help get the best performance from an artist, help them pick their material, or develop their material, and help set the course of what they're doing creatively  tim ferriss: and, how did you end up becoming initially involved with that type of work?  rick rubin: i don't know how you usually do, and i guess you can do it in many different ways. some people might start as a recording engineer, and then graduate to a record producersome people might be successful artists, and then transition into being record producers. in my case, i was just really a fan of music, and i come at it from the point of view of being a fan.  tim ferriss: what did you study at nyu?  rick rubin: i started as a philosophy major, then after two years, switched to film and television, because all of my friends were in film and television, it just seemed like more fun  tim ferriss: was it more fun?  rick rubin: it was.  tim ferriss: i think it's natalie maynard, the dixie chicks, has said, and this is paraphrasing, but that you let music be discovered, not manufactured. what does she mean by that, or what do you think she means by that?  rick rubin: well, we have a whole process. you know, it's different for every artist, but we try to go on a journey, and let the artist discover who they are, and in the process, the best art comes from them. it's like getting to be their true selves, and trying to take away all of the -   there are so many things that get in the way of the artistic process for example, any commercial considerations usually get in the way if you're thinking about making music that's gonna get on the radio, chances are, you won't be using your own voice to its most potent, most singular - finding what your personal gift is. so, that's one of many things. getting closer to the source, and not getting distracted by any nonsense that could get in the way of the art being as good as it could be.  tim ferriss: what are other things that get in the way of artist producing their best work?  rick rubin: concern about what other people think. competition, wanting to do better than someone else. let's see, what are the things? self-doubt, ego.  tim ferriss: what manifestation of ego?  rick rubin: if someone thinks that everything they do is great, they might not be willing to edit themselves enough, or work hard enough at - if i can write ten great songs, five minutes each, and those are the best songs, and i'm just gonna record them and put them out, then those might not be as good as the ones you develop over a long period of time, for example. that might be an egotistical artist, who thinks everything i do is just great.  tim ferriss: when you have the opposite, when you have an artist who's doubting themselves, how do you help them through that, or what do you recommend? i have a lot - but speaking personally, i have continuous self-doubt. as a writer  rick rubin: i think most artists do. more typically, self-doubt is the case. i think if your goal is to be better than you were, you know, if you're competing only with yourself, it's a more realistic place to be. if you say, i don't want to write songs unless i can write songs better than the beatles; it's a very hard road. but, if you say, i want to write a better song tomorrow than the song i wrote yesterday, that's a realistic - that's something that can be done.   and, if you write a better song than you wrote yesterday every day, then you continue to get better and better and better, and it really is small steps, and also, trying not to think so much. because so much of it is - the job is - it's more emotion and heartwork than it is headwork. like, the head comes in after, to look at what the heart has presented, and to organize itbut, the initial inspiration comes from a different place, and it's not the head, and it's not an intellectual activity. it's more inspiration. so, the key, first, is to really do whatever activities you can -   to tune into inspiration, and things like meditating help. and, diving into art in general. it doesn't even have to be your modalityi mean, going to museums and looking at beautiful art can help you write better songs. reading great novels, reading great works of art, seeing a great movie could inspire a great song. reading poetry, so, i'd say, being in - submerging yourself in great art, and the more you can do to get out of the mode of competition, where you're looking at what other people are doing, and wanting to be better than them, or be inspired by them. i'd say the only way to use the inspiration of other artists is if you submerge yourself in the greatest works of all time.   which is a great thing to do, like, if you listen to the greatest music ever made.   that would be a better way to work through to find your own voice, to matter today, than listening to what's on the radio now, and thinking i wanna compete with this  tim ferriss: right.  rick rubin: so, it's more of like, a stepping back, and looking at a bigger picture than what's going on at the moment.  tim ferriss: as someone who is not well versed in music - i don't feel highly literate when it comes to music. i enjoy music. but, hanging out with you and neil strauss certainly, i feel like i'm lacking perhaps a vocabulary, and a lot of references. are there any - for people who feel like they're in my shoes, are there any particular albums that you could offer as a starting point?   not the end all be all, just a starting point for appreciating good, contemporary music? meaning, not necessarily - could be classical music but are there any that you could -  rick rubin: yeah, i would just start by listening to the greats, which you can look up. if you search online for mojo's top 100 albums of all time, or rolling stone's top 100 albums, or any trusted source's top 100 albums, and start listening to what are considered the greats. it's a good place to start.  tim ferriss: and, are there any particular stories that you have, that come to mind, of experiences outside of the medium of music, say a specific film, or a specific trip, or a specific book, that catalyzed a breakthrough in the work that you did?  rick rubin: let me think about that for a sec. i wouldn't say breakthrough.   because it's a more personal thing than that, so it doesn't come as much from the outside, but i get inspiration every day, from either what i'm reading, or watching a sunset, or noticing the number of birds that fly overhead, and their different shapes and what they look like, or paying attention, and hearing the sound of the wavesall of those things speak to - or, looking at the horizon, they all speak to me. and, so much of the work we try to do is to create something with the natural balance that we see in nature. that's sort of the perfect version of - if you can make a piece of music that can take your breath away as much as a beautiful sunset, you've done well.   so, any opportunity to see dolphins swim, or to see something beautiful, that's not your run of the mill experience. or, even, could be a beautiful, cloud-filled sky. or, on a particularly clear night, when you can really see lots of stars. those are all inspiring things, and help turn on the muse of recognizing kind of a greater vision of either what's possible, or what's beautiful than something that you see in a magazine, that's there as an advertisement to entice you to buy it.  tim ferriss: right. and, can you talk a little bit about, when did you realize that you were good at working with musicians, or music?   rick rubin: when did that happen?  tim ferriss: yeah.   when did that happen, and are there any particular, whether it's instances or artists where you thought, wow, i might actually have a knack for this?  rick rubin: well, right from the beginning, i started having a lot of success, and i did it - i really made music as a hobby, while i was in college, and i thought i would have a real job, and make music as a hobby. and, i thought i would have a job to support my music habit. and then, the first album i produced was by ll cool j. he was 16 at the time, and i think it cost us about $8,000.00 to recordit sold 900,000 copies. which was a good start.  tim ferriss: that is a good start.rick rubin: and then, the second one was beastie boys, which i think sold 9 or 10 million. so, from then on, just a lot of records, sold a lot of records right from the beginning   so, it - i'll say it took a long time for me to understand that that doesn't always happen, it's an unusual series of events. but, a long time, of working with a lot of artists, and seeing a lot of success, it became clear that i could support artists in doing good work, and people seem to appreciate it.  tim ferriss: what are some of the things - what are some of the ways or characteristics that make you different than perhaps other people who work with musicians?  rick rubin: well, it's hard to say, because i don't know so much what other people do, but i don't think we do the same thing. there are some producers who make beats for artists, and there was a time in my career when i did that, early in my career i did that. still will do that, if it makes sense with the project that i'm doing.   i think it's unusual that i get to work in lots of different genres, and get to make heavy metal records, and rap records, and country records, and spiritual records, all different kinds. i think that's unusual and just lucky, and i think that might come from the fact that i come from that fan perspective, and i like all kinds of music, and i get to examine them, and the fact that i've been able to work on so many different kinds of music over such a long period of time gives me a good perspective, because when i come into a new project, it's not -   it's rare that i'm going to the studio to work on another of what i was just working on. so, let's say, for example, i was a heavy metal producer, and all i did for the last 30 years was produce heavy metal, i don't know how fresh those records would be today.   but now, if i get to produce a heavy metal record, like, the last one i did would be, i guess the last black sabbath album, it was really fun, because i hadn't made a record like that in a long time, and it was a brand new experience.  tim ferriss: that's 13?  rick rubin: 13 was the last one, yep. and, it was a great experience. never worked with those guys before, and we had a great time.  tim ferriss: so, i'm not sure if i ever told you, the first time i ever saw the name rick rubin was on the inside of an audio cassette. it was the first heavy metal album i ever bought, which was reign in blood.  rick rubin: oh, it's a good one. that's a really good one.  tim ferriss: and, i just remember, not having - this is pre-internet, of course, and i was just told by my friends, you will love heavy metal, you should listen to heavy metal, and i asked what the hardest heavy metal was that could possibly be found, and reign in blood came to the lips of those i asked. and, i just remember listening to, i think it's angel of death, the first track on that album, and going, oh my god, what have i gotten myself into? and just fell in love with that band.   but, how did you go from hiphop to say, slayer, it's so stylistically different, it would seem, but how did slayer come about?  rick rubin: yeah. as i said, because i was coming about it with no technical skill, i didn't know anything about hiphop or heavy metal, i was a fan of music, and i loved heavy metal, and i loved hiphop, so it was more just coming at it from an appreciation, and as a fan, knowing what i wanted to hear. especially in the case of slayerslayer were an underground metal band, who had two albums out on an independent label, and were kind of considered the heaviest band in the world.   and, when we signed them, there was this terrible fear, that slayer, they were doing their first album for a major label, they were gonna sell out. tim ferriss: get watered down.  rick rubin: yeah, which happens all the time. and then, the album that we made, reign in blood, was much harder, and worse than anything that anyone had ever heard before   and, it really did come from that, i always liked extreme things, and they were extreme, and i wanted to maximize it. i didn't want to water down - the idea of watering things down for a mainstream audience, i don't think it applies. i think people want things that are really passionate, and the best version they could be, and often, the best version they could be is not for everybody.  tim ferriss: right.  rick rubin: the best art divides the audience, where if you put out a record, and half the people who hear it absolutely love it, and half the people who hear it absolutely hate it, you've done well, because it's pushing that boundary. if everyone thinks, oh, that's pretty good, why bother making it? it almost - it doesn't mean as much,  tim ferriss: lost in the slipstream of time, almost as soon as it comes out  rick rubin: i'm gonna do a round of ice, if that's alright.  tim ferriss: absolutely alright. let's do some ice, and we'll be back.   okay, we are back, and i'd love to talk a little bit about ll cool j versus for instance, slayer. is the way in which you work with those two groups of creatives - or, in the case of ll cool j, i don't know how many people were involved on his side, but is there a different approach, when giving feedback, when trying to cultivate their ability?  rick rubin: i'd say it's really different with every single artist, and it's - you spend time with the artist, you get to know them, and if you listen to people, if you really listen to what people say, usually, they tell you everything. if you really listen and pay attention to what people are saying, they'll let you know a lot of stuff   and, i just really pay attention to what people say, and then through that, i can then reflect back thoughts that they've told me about themselves, and that they don't know about themselvesand, allow them to unlock those doors, to allow them to go to the places where they wanna go, artistically tim ferriss: are there any particular examples of that, or a story that you could share?  rick rubin: hmm. the first story that comes to mind isn't related to my music work, but it's related to our friend neil, and just the journey that's led to his new book, that's about to come out. it started through him complaining about something going on in his life -   that was something that he thought he wanted in his life, and i don't think he knew that the thing that he wanted was making him unhappy. and, through that conversation, he decided to examine that. same as that. that'd be the first one that came to mind, maybe because we both know neil.  tim ferriss: rightyou seem very philosophically minded, very calm, and i should thank you, also. you and a friend named chase jarvits, he's a world-class photographer, are actually the people who got me into meditation consistently, with tm. so, thank you for that. but, have you always been very calm? and, you seem very unperturbed, very unfazed, by anything that i've observed. is that an illusion, or have you always been that way?  rick rubin: i'm very lucky that i learned the meditate when i was young, so i started meditating when i was 14, and i meditated a lot for a long time, and through that, i think it has really - even though i'm not always calm on the inside, it has at least given me an air of calm, and maybe comparative to other people, i'm calm. i know sometimes, internally, i can get disrupted  tim ferriss: what do you do when you get disrupted?  rick rubin: i try to do something. often, exercise will make me feel better, meditating will make me feel better, the ice bath is the greatest of all.  tim ferriss: the king of all mood elevators.  rick rubin: it's just magic, sauna/ice, back and forth. at the end of the fourth, or fifth, or sixth round of being in an ice tub, there is nothing in the world that bothers you.  tim ferriss: it's true, it's very true  rick rubin: it's just like, the world's a great place.  tim ferriss: what are the types of things that disrupt you? are there any particular patterns?  rick rubin: i would say usually work things, or political related - you know, political-type things related to work could really bother me. just when they don't fit into my realm of the way i look at life, so i get surprised by those things  tim ferriss: just having to manage the various relationships, say within a label, or something like that?  rick rubin: yeah, i would say more dealing with business people, who can often like, wow, you really think that, you really wanna do things that way? it's like, surprising.  tim ferriss: what are some of the ways in which you've designed your life to, say, not have to content with as much of that as possible?  rick rubin: well, i always really try to focus my life around art. so, i consider my job - even though there are other parts of my job, i consider my real job, the reason i'm here, is to sit with artists, talk with artists, help artists be better at what they do.   and, if i'm not doing it with an artist, i'm doing it with something else. it's like, my goal is to make things as good as they could be. either make - whatever it is, - to the point of where i've gone in to visit friends in their office, and i rearrange the furniture in their inner office, because i'm insane. it would really look better if you moved these things this way, and you could see the sun coming in through the window here, and if you open these blinds and turn this around, this place would be a lot more comfortable.  tim ferriss: when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind?  rick rubin: it's not such an easy question to answer. because, i mean, so many things go into what makes someone successful.  tim ferriss: what are some of those things?  rick rubin: i would start with somebody who's happy. i know a great many people who are financially successful and not happy, so i would rule all of them out, to start with. let's see. it's not coming as easily. i have to think about that, and we can come back to it.  tim ferriss: we can come back to it. how do you - this is a very self-interested question, but i'll ask it. so, i'm 37, of course, we've both spent a lot of time around neiland, i'm not gonna spoil the secret, because neil would be apoplectic, but the next book i'm looking forward to -  rick rubin: i just thought of a couple of examples of people who are successful  tim ferriss: oh, let's do it.  rick rubin: a good example of someone who is successful is don wildman, our friend from the beach.  tim ferriss: whom i still have not met, amazingly.  rick rubin: he's 80 years old, he did 23 pull-ups on the beach the other dayhe's in the senior olympics. he retired in his 50's, because he wanted to spend his days enjoying life and exercising. and, he's one of the most inspiring, uplifting, great, successful people, on so many levels. he'd be probably the first one i think of. laird's another good example of someone who i would think of as successful, he's a successful human being.  tim ferriss: and, that's laird hamilton.  rick rubin: laird hamilton.  tim ferriss: for those not familiar with laird, pretty much uncontroversially, i'd say, thought of as the king of big wave surfing, among other things.  rick rubin: yeah, i mean, it's not uncommon to hear him referred to as the greatest athlete on earth.   he's a real - so many athletes of so many disciplines, think of him as the best athlete.  tim ferriss: also a king of steam rooms and ice baths.  rick rubin: i started doing the sauna and the ice with laird. anyway, successful is someone who enjoys their life, is great at what they do, is curious, and continually pushing forward, and wanting to be better than they were yesterday, without beating themselves up about it.  tim ferriss: and, what are - don is - his name has come up so many timeswhat are some of the things that you've learned or picked up from him, or adopted for yourself?  rick rubin: he's just seemed so positive, and nothing - it seems like nothing gets to him. he's - he can push through anything that's in his way, and all the time with a smile on his face, and a positive outlook, and a curious nature. how - i don't know how many people that are 80, that every time you meet them teach you something about something new they've learned. because they're so curious about a great article, or a great book, and you have to read this book, and you have to go to see this movie, and you have to do this, and we just came back from snowboarding in alaska, and you have to go see, it was unbelievable. and, just, he's got a wild life.  tim ferriss: that's inspiring. i've, in the last few years, in particular i'd say last year, with my health scare with lyme disease, and everything that came of that -   tried to surround myself not just with the extremely young athletes and performers, but, for instance, this polish gentleman and his wife, both of whom are world record holders in olympic weight lifting. but, what's so fascinating is how, i'd say relatively injury-free and mobile they still are, and they're in their, i'd say, early 60's at this point  rick rubin: amazing.  tim ferriss: yeah. and, i've really tried to spend more time in the last couple years modeling what those people do. do you have a book, or books that you've gifted often to other people?  rick rubin: there are many. the first one that comes to mind is the tao te ching. it's the stephen mitchell translation of the tao te chingwhat's great about it is, it's 81 short pieces, that you could look at them as poems, that, if you were to read the book today, you would get one thing from it.   and, if you were to pick it up in two years and read it again, it would mean something entirely different, and always on the money. always what you need to read at that particular period of time. so, it's a magic book, in that way, in that it always fits.  tim ferriss: i actually took - god, this is bringing back a memory. i actually took an entire class on the tao te ching at princeton when i was an undergrad in east asian studies. and, it seems on some level, that that book does what you do for musicians. meaning that it sort of reflects back truths that they were not aware of themselves, or they could not verbalize themselves. any other books come to mind?  rick rubin: another one that's really nice is a book about meditation called wherever you go, there you are, which is by john cabot simand, it's a great book if you've never meditated, and if you've been meditating for 50 years.   if you read this book, either way, you'll care more about meditation, become a better meditator, and just give insight into why we do it, and what the benefits are.  tim ferriss: do you have any favorite movies, or documentaries?   rick rubin: i watch lots of documentaries, let me think of one that's a favoritejust watched one the other night that was spectacular, new nick cave, the english - well, i guess he's australian, he lives in england. musician, has a new documentary that's quite an unusual documentary, because it's part documentary and part, i guess, not you have to see it. but, it's called 20,000 days on earth.  tim ferriss: 20,000 days on earth  rick rubin: yeahso, that was the last one that just really, like, wow, how great is that?  tim ferriss: are there any - have you had any points of overwhelm in your length? in your length. that's not a question. the heat's getting to my head. in your career? rick rubin: the heat's getting to you?  tim ferriss: yeah, the heat's getting to me.  rick rubin: i have to switch hands, because my hand is burning. wow.  tim ferriss: do you experience overwhelm, or have you?  rick rubin: yes. i definitely experience overwhelm. too much going on at one time, or often, it's self-imposed. or, i make it a point to always be there, as best as i can be for the artists that i work with, and sometimes, their needs can overtake my own needs.   and then, i feel overwhelmed, because i wanna be there for them, and then i find that i'm not taking care of myself. so, finding that balance.  tim ferriss: what do you do in those situations? when you come to that realization?  rick rubin: when i realize it, i'll usually talk to the artist about it, and explain the situation. i would say, any situation that feels sticky, if you explain it to the person that it feels sticky with, almost always, it eases very quickly. and, it brings you closer together.  tim ferriss: and, do you explain the situation the way that you just described it to me, or what is the actual -  rick rubin: it just depends on the case, but i might say, i feel really overwhelmed right now, this is what's going on with me.   can we talk about this later, or can we address this, is that okay, or usually talk about it.  tim ferriss: how you feeling?rick rubin: getting hot.  tim ferriss: you tell me. i'll let you call the rotation of the guards, when we go to ice. but, i'm very curious, i remember seeing your -  rick rubin: i burned myself.  tim ferriss: i think this is a fine idea. i will say, i will absolve myself for any hot objects. but, your cameo in 99 problems. rick rubin: yes  tim ferriss: how did that come about?  rick rubin: i had produced the song for jay, and then, when it was time to make the video, a friend of mine, mark romanek, who's a great video maker, made the video, and i think it was mark's idea. he said, why don't we get rick in the video?   and jay agreed, and they called and asked if i would come, and i love jay, he's a really great guy, and i thought it would be fun.  tim ferriss: what are you proudest of, as it relates to that track? if it comes to mind, i know you've worked with a lot of tracks  rick rubin: just that jay is one of the most important artists in the world, and that's one of his most popular songs, and that we got to do it together is just really great.  tim ferriss: how did you become involved with that song? or, were you involved with the entire album?   rick rubin: i was involved with that song, we went into the studio together. it was his last - it was going to be his last album, the black album, his retirement album, and he asked his ten favorite producers to each do one song. and, we went into the studio, that was the first time we worked together, and we -   we spent a week in the studio, trying different things, and then, eventually came upon this track, and the experimentation, and he loved it. and, the words came to him sort of magically. he sat in the back of the room, listened to the track over and over and over again, and after about a half hour he said, i've got it, and jumped up and ran into the other room, and did the vocals, without writing anything down.  tim ferriss: so, i've heard this about him before, where at some point, i heard a story that he wrote basically gibberish down on a piece of paper, because someone trying to supervise him earlier in his career was so worried that he wasn't taking the recording session seriouslybut, in fact, he wasn't writing down anything at all, it was just to put them at ease. and then, freestyled the entire thing. is that how he operates?  rick rubin: that's how he does it, yeah tim ferriss: that's mind-boggling  rick rubin: he's super talented, and just a great person.   one of my favorite people.  tim ferriss: what do you like about him?  rick rubin: everything. he's humble, he's honest, he's a deep soul. he looks at things deeply. understands them deeply, is caring, and is just a first rate person. i think i'm gonna get in the ice.  tim ferriss: alright, time to go to the ice. i'll hit pause, i was right  rick rubin: crazy.  tim ferriss: crazy is right.  rick rubin: it adds up.  tim ferriss: it does add up. that was a particularly chilly ice bath, it's now lower than the minimum measurement, which is 40 degrees, so i feel like all the skin below my neck has just contracted by 30 percent. it's a good feeling.   and, you mentioned this briefly when we were coming in, but who's the first person who introduced you to using a sauna?  rick rubin: yeah, the first sauna that i was in was a local friend of ours, chris chelios, who's a hockey player, and he had the longest professional hockey career of anyone ever. he continued playing professionally until he was 48 years old, and all of the people on the other teams that he was facing at the time were in their 20's, so he's really an unbelievable athlete. and, he has done sauna every day of his life, for the last - since he's been playing. and he believes that the reason he had the longevity in the sport, and he never got sick, and was able to never miss a game, and to play for such a long career, was all due to the sauna, every day.  tim ferriss: and, he used hot sauna, he was not alternating between hot and cold?  rick rubin: he did hot and cold, but he wouldn't necessarily use an ice bath, he would do cold showers if not. but, he would do 15 or 20 minutes in the sauna, cold shower, 15 or 20 minutes in the sauna, round and round.  tim ferriss: and, how were you introduced to the ice baths?  rick rubin: the ice baths came from joachim noah, who's my girlfriend's nephew. and, he bought an ice tub for laird, because laird started doing the sauna, after chris started doing the sauna. we have a group who would do it on the beach. chris has a sauna on the beach, so we would do the sauna, even in the wintertime, and then we would jump into the ocean. and, that was how we did the hot and the cold. and then, joachim suggested we start using the ice tub, and then we started doing that, and that was - took it to a whole new level.  tim ferriss: and you've done some very unusual training, that sounds terrifying to me, underwater, right? and do you continue to do the underwater training, with weights?  rick rubin: yeah, that's something we'll do with laird, we'll do, like, 50-pound dumbbells, 14 feet underwater, and it's an interesting experience. like, a lot like getting into the ice bath. if you're not used to getting into an ice bath, and someone says jump into a tub of ice, you'll probably react negatively  tim ferriss: panic.  rick rubin: they panic, and when you're holding a 50-pound weight underwater, your brain goes crazy. it relates to, okay, weight underwater, you die. it's like cement shoes.  tim ferriss: right.  rick rubin: so, we do all these exercises with weights underwater, it's really interesting.  tim ferriss: and, do you - and keep this in mind, folks, don't do this without supervision.   consult your doctor, but what does the technique look like?  rick rubin: well, it started - laird has a pool, that you can start in the shallow end, and walk down to the deep end, and down the center of the pool, there's a staircase, underwater. so, it started with holding heavy weights and walking from the shallow end to the deep end, and obviously, there's a point where you have to take a big breath and hold it, and then you walk down into the deep end, and you turn around and you walk up the stairs, and make it before you run out of breath. and, each time you do it, you would make wider and wider circles, and get used to being under longer and longer   and then, we started adding, once we were completely submerged, start adding maybe curls, or shoulder presses, and start doing those underwater, and one day, after we'd been doing this about a year -   laird came into the gym one day, and he said i had a dream last night, that if we use lighter weights, they'll be heavy enough to keep us down, but light enough to where we could jump up to the top.  tim ferriss: in the deep end?  rick rubin: in the deep end, so you'd be down in the deep end. so, now, instead of doing one rep, and recovering, which was all we could do before. we could do one round, basically. and then you'd be in the shallow end and recover. and then, we started doing these exercises with jumping, so we'd start with, maybe, 15 pound dumbbells, and you would hold two 15-pound dumbbells, jump into the deep end, sink to the bottom, and then jump as hard as you can, holding your arms above your head, and then, kinda do one stroke, pulling your arms down to the sides, holding the dumbbells.   and, it was just enough to get your head out, and you gasp for a breath, and then you'd sink, and we'd do that over, and over, and over again. at first, maybe the goal would be to do ten in a row, and it'd be really a big deal, and we could do ten in a row. and then, over time, we worked up to being able to do 100 in a rowand then, doing it with heavier weights. and then, since then, laird's come up with maybe 50 exercises that we do with weights   underwater. either underwater or in water. and, while -  tim ferriss: he dreams up some really fascinating not only exercises but devices. for those people who haven't see, the foilboard, is that what it is?rick rubin: the foilboard's amazing.  tim ferriss: the foilboard, yeah. people can google foilboard.  rick rubin: he invented standup paddling, really. he invented standup paddling, he invented tow-in surfing.   he's an amazing, he's got an amazing analytical mind  tim ferriss: do you think, did he develop that, in any particular way?  rick rubin: the mind?   tim ferriss: the analytical mind.  rick rubin: i think he's very mechanical, to start with, i think it starts with that, and he's willing to try things, and fail at things, to be able to get to do something. so, he - the first day i went to his gym, i couldn't do one push up, and really, it was through his belief, and his inspiration that i was able to learn all of the things i was able to learn with him. and, i remember, he showed me one exercise, i couldn't do it at all, and i said, i can't do that.   and, he said, no, don't say you can't do it, say you haven't done it yet. and, he'd say okay, let's divide it into three pieces. do the first third of the exercise, and i could do the first third. do the last third of the exercise, and i could do that. now, do the middle third by itself, and i could do that. and, he said, now put the first two pieces together. and i could do that. and then, put the second and third piece together, and i could do that. and then, eventually, i could do the whole exercise. at first, it seemed impossible, but he walked me through it, and -  tim ferriss: broke it down for you  rick rubin: yeah. just taught me how to see past the limitations that i put on myself.  tim ferriss: what was the exercise? do you recall what that was?  rick rubin: that might have been a jump through, like a burpee with weightshe would let you do a shoulder press -   and then you'd put the weights down on the ground, hold them, hold the dumbbells, and then jump back into a pushup position, then jump up and slide your legs forward through.  tim ferriss: right, right  rick rubin: and then, jump up into a squat position, and that would be one, one round.  tim ferriss: that's some intense movement. what are some of the physical experiments that you're doing these days? or training protocols that you're experimenting with?  rick rubin: there's always so many, i have to think of what's new and currenti've been doing hyperbaric oxygen, and i really like that.  tim ferriss: that's in a chamber?  rick rubin: yeahi do the wim hof breathing technique. i just started doing, there's a wim hof ten-week course. you can check online, w, i, m, h, o, f.   just started learning that.  tim ferriss: he's a fascinating guy  rick rubin: yeah. he's really into ice.  tim ferriss: i can see. i've never seen anyone more tolerant of ice. i think he has a world's record for sitting in a box, a bisquick cube of ice  rick rubin: didn't he climb mount everest, just in swim trunks?  tim ferriss: he has some incredible thermoregulatory capabilities  rick rubin: he ran a marathon in the desert with no water, so that was another one. the two extremes of the heat or the cold.  tim ferriss: the guy's a monster, i really wanna get him on the podcast at some point.  rick rubin: he'd be a good one. let's see, what else? those are the ones that come to mind at the moment.  tim ferriss: how do you, just as laird did for you, when you're working with an artist who believes they can't do something, or is just hitting that wall, what are some of the ways that you help them get past that? rick rubin: usually, i'll give them homework, a small, doable task. i'll give you an example. there was an artist i was working with recently, who hadn't made an album in a long time, and was struggling with finishing anything. and, just had this - it was a version of a writer's block, but it was - i don't know, hard to explain what it was. but, i would give him very doable homework assignments, that almost seemed like a joke. tonight, i want you to write one word, in this song that needs five lines, that you can't finish, i just want one word that you like, by tomorrow, do you think that you could come up with one word?   and, usually, he'd be like yeah, i think i can do one word. and, just very quickly, by breaking it down into pieces, like i learned from laird, and chipping away, one step at a time, you can really get through anything.  tim ferriss: yeah. breaking it down into manageable bites.  rick rubin: i remember, on the beach, we had a zip line. not a zip line, you know, the beam that you balance on?  tim ferriss: oh, a slackline.  rick rubin: slackline. and, laird was pretty good at it, in the beginning, but had never done it before. and, he would work for hours. he would just be there, hour after hour after hour, falling off and getting back on, falling off and getting back on. and then, of all of the group of people, he was by far the first one that was able to do it. and, it wasn't because he naturally was gifted at it.   he knows that anything he sets his mind to learn to do, if he focuses and continues to not mind falling off, and not thinking he's supposed to be good out of the box, learning how to do it, that's how you learn things. i also will say that, after having the weight problem that i had for so long, and finally finding the solution, and making the change, it really makes me believe that anything's possible. we can learn, we can train ourselves to do absolutely anything, it's really just getting the right information   if we get the right information, we can learn to do anything. now, it doesn't mean we can necessarily be the best in the world at something, but we can be our best at that thing.  tim ferriss: right. the best version of ourselves.  rick rubin: yeah, and do things that we never dreamed of as possible for us. tim ferriss: what advice - and i'll ask this for a couple of different ages, but i'll start with 20. what advice would you give your 20-year-old self, if any?  rick rubin: try to have more fun  tim ferriss: why do you think you weren't having as much fun as you could have, at that point?  rick rubin: i think i was more driven, and i don't know, i wanna say that i had something to prove. i don't know if i did have something to prove, but i felt like doing the work was the most important thing in the world, as opposed to doing the work and enjoying the process, and feeling what it was -   being able to step back, and see what it was, not just be so deeply into it that - i feel like i missed a lot of years of my life, because i was just in a dark room, working on music. seven days a week for 20 years.  tim ferriss: wow. i recall, that makes me think of a story from neil gaiman, the writer. when he - i think it was with the success of sandman, and he was in a huge line of readers who wanted signatures, and fans who wanted to tell him stories, and stephen king pulled him aside and just said enjoy it. and he didn't, he was too caught up in the flow. what about your 30-year-old self? what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self?  rick rubin: i guess i might tell myself something that still might apply to me today. i wouldn't have known it then at all, i know it now, it's just not second nature   but, to be kinder to myself, because i think i've beaten myself up a lot, because i expect a lot from myself, i'll be hard on myself, and i don't know that i'm doing anyone any good by doing that  tim ferriss: that's advice that i need to give myself. when do you tend to beat yourself up? i've made somewhat of a sport of it, it would seem.  rick rubin: yeah. it could happen anytime, i could come up with anything that i could be doing to further something, and didn't already think of it, and didn't already do it, i might beat myself up about why have i not done that?  tim ferriss: now, something that i struggle with, that i'd love to get your two cents on -!  is related to this, which is, on one hand, i don't wanna beat myself up, on the other hand, i feel like the perfectionism that i have has enabled me to achieve whatever modicum of success i've been able to achieve. i've heard stories about, and you can correct me if i'm wrong, but zz top and la futura, and how they worked on it with you for\u00e9 i wanna say 2008 to 2012, but how they realized the value of you wanting the art to be as perfect as it could be, or the best it could be, and taking whatever time and pains necessary to make that possible.   so, i'd love to hear your thoughts on that. i wanna be easier on myself, but i worry that if i do that, i will lose whatever magic, if there is such a thing, that enables me to do what i do.  rick rubin: yeah. i think that, ultimately, the - i think that's a myth, and i think that your take on things is specific to you, and it's not because of your - it's almost like you've won the war, and to accept the fact that you've won the war, you have an audiencepeople are willing to hear what you are interested in, what you're interested in learning about, and what you wanna share. and, you can do that without killing yourself. and, that killing yourself won't be of service, neither to you or your audience. i gotta get in the ice.  tim ferriss: all right, let's - this has been great, let's call a close to this.   is there any last parting advice or comment that you'd like to make before we sign off?  rick rubin: i think it's too hot for me to even - i don't know what happening now.  tim ferriss: what's up or down?  rick rubin: yeah. i'm very confused at the moment. but, i know that this ice bath is gonna change everything for the better  tim ferriss: alright, well, on that note, thanks so much, rick.  rick rubin: thank you.  tim ferriss: we'll both get some ice. i'll let you get out first   until next time, thank you for listening.i", "speakers": ["rick rubin", "tim ferriss"], "text_sentences": ["guten tag, my sexy little munchkins, this is tim ferriss, in a very echo-laden wooden room, on an island and we'll be hearing more about that in a few short episodes with chris sacca, but in the meantime, i am so excited to present an episode that was very, very physically demanding, and this conversation that you are about to listen to is with none other than rick rubin", "and, if you don't recognize that name, well, the bio could seem almost fabricated, it is so impressive", "so, he has been called the most important producer, that's music producer, of the last 20 years by mtv", "and, in 2007, he appeared on time's 100 most influential people in the world list", "why would he appear on such a list", "well, if you can imagine, say in the book world, that you named every author you could think of, off the top of your head, all the name brand folks, and then found out that one agent and one editor were responsible for all of them", "you'd be dumbfounded", "and, that's pretty much the case, when you look at the discography of rick rubin", "so, he was the former co-president of columbia records, he was the co-founder, along with russell simmons, of def jam records, and helped to popularize hiphop music, by working with the beastie boys, ll cool j, public enemy, run-dmc, for instanceand, i'm not gonna give the whole list, because it's too long, but here are just some of the artists that he has worked with: red hot chili peppers, beastie boys,

eminem, you name it", "so, he's a fascinating guy", "very much a zen monk in his temperament, and i've gotten to know rick over the last few years, and he insisted that we do the podcast in his sauna.iwhich is a barrel sauna, that makes your head melt, it is so intenseso, this was a very challenging episode, i hope you get some laughs out of it, and what you will realize very quickly is, you have to listen very intently to rick's answers", "so, rick has sort of layers behind layers, behind layers", "so, he'll tell you something, and you'll be like, i'm not sure i get that", "and then, months later, it'll dawn on you, oh my god, there are so many different depths to that answer, i didn't pick up on it the first time around", "so, you will have to interpret and ponder a lot of what rick brings up, but i hope you enjoy this", "i enjoyed it, even though i almost got heatstroke, and, without further ado, here is rick rubin", "whoa, well almost without further ado", "folks, one more ado", "i forgot to mention, if you are interested in music, be sure to check out the drumming episode of the tim ferriss experiment, it's my tv show, it's been the no", "one tv season on itunes now for some time, amazingly", "but, if you go to itunes.com/timferriss, two r's, two s's, you can see a bunch of bonus footage, all of the episodesincluding the drumming episode", "where i am trained by stewart copeland, the founding drummer of the police, widely considered one of the top 10 drummers of all time, his teaching method resembles doc from back to the future, it is an amazing experience",

been looking forward to it/dreading it, ever since you first mentioned it to mewhere are we right now", "we are sitting in a sauna", "we are sitting in a very hot barrel sauna, and i was told that was one of the conditions for having this conversation", "and, it's such an impressive barrel sauna, it's indoors, that i wanted to get the specs for it when i first saw it", "and, you have a heater that must be, what, four times the size of a conventional heater from off the shelf that would go into one of these -", "yeah, it's a much bigger heater than for the size of the room we're in", "and, i'm sitting on the floor, because i have such limited confidence in my ability to withstand heat compared to you", "but, we do have the alternate, which is the bath just outside of this doorand, you and i have gone back and forth many times of course, with this type of cycling, but what is right outside this door", "a metal tub, filled with ice   it is a metal tub, about four feet, three and a half feet off the ground, full of ice", "it looks like, if you were to say, a horse trough times two, something like that", "something like that", "it's gotta be maximum low 50's, something like that", "i think it's about, today, it's probably about 38 degrees", "oh, my god, okay, so, we have two mics on the floor, i'm hoping won't explode", "or melt down, the h4 and the h6, and we have water, ice, heat, nothing could go wrong", "i'm looking forward to it", "so, rick, i was hoping we could start with a discussion of your physical transformation", "and, i'd love for you to kind of describe to people - i mean, you're the picture of, in my mind, fitness in a lot of ways, now, and we've been paddleboarding before, and you always summarily whoop my ass, i'm always impressed", "there are a lot of things contributing to my lack of competency and fear there", "but, where were you, and how did you end up undergoing this physical transformation", "because you've lost how much weight, at this point", "how much fat, would you say", "i lost, at the peak moment, i lost between 135 and 140 poundsand, i always thought i was eating a healthy diet", "i was vegan for 20-something years", "and, all organic, vegan, really very strict with what i ate", "and, doing that, i got up to 318 pounds, and i read a book by a guy named stu middleman, who ran 1,000 miles in 11 days, and i remember reading that, and thinking wow, i can barely walk down the block, and this guy ran 1,000 miles in 11 days, and it just seemed so inspiring", "so, i read his book, and in the book, he talked about a guy named phil mafetone, who i'd never heard of", "but, he got to this part in the books where he talks about, i met this doctor named phil mafetone, and he changed the way i trained, and he changed the way i ate, and he changed all these things, and then all of the sudden, i was able to do all of these things", "it's like, okay, i wanna find phil mafetone so, i found him online, i sent him an email", "and, he was living in florida, and i asked if i could become his patient", "and, he said that he had just stopped treating patients, and retired from being a doctor", "well, that's terrible news", "but, the reason that he retired from being a doctor was, he decided to become a songwriter", "i said, oh, that's interesting -  funny you should mention that", "yeah, i'm involved in songwriting and the music world, maybe we can trade", "maybe i can help you with your songwriting, maybe you can help me with my health and fitness", "and, he liked the idea, and we ended up meeting a few months later, and met several times, and became friends, and he eventually ended up moving into my house, and lived in my house for about two years", "and, i did everything he said, and i got much healthier, my metabolism got turned on, the hours that i was sleeping shifted", "i - for most of my life, i stayed up all night, and slept most of the day", "and, when i was in college, i never took a class before 3:00pm, because i knew i wouldn't go", "and, this was at nyu", "nyu", "so, i'm used to living a night lifestyle, even in high school", "i remember, i missed the first three classes of school so many times, that it was really an issue", "but, i'd learned to be up all night, i'd learned to be a late-night person", "and, it kinda suited the music life, like, it worked well with my life", "and, one of the first things that phil suggested when we got together was, i slept with blackout blinds", "and i usually didn't leave the house until the sun was setting", "and, he said, from now on, when you wake up, i want you to go outside", "as soon as you wake up, open the blinds, and go outside, naked if possible, and be in the sun for 20 minutes", "and, when he said it, i remember thinking, it'd be the same as if he said, i want you to jump off this ledge", "it'd be the most terrifying, based on the way i live my life, that just sounded terrible", "right", "what time was he recommending that you wake up", "well, by the time we started, it kept moving down, and it went from 3:00 to probably noon, to 11:00, to 9:00", "and, it just sorta happened naturally, and he knew that if i immediately went in the sun, that naturally, my body would start wanting to wake up earlier, and going to sleep earlier", "it was the first time ever that my circadian rhythm was kicking in", "it never was - i never knew that there was such a thing, or knew what that was", "so, he got me to connect to that   and, i did everything he said, changed my diet", "started eating some animal protein, i was, as i said, a devout vegan, so eggs and fish were the first things i would eat", "and, even then, i never liked eggs, and i never liked fish, so i ate them more like medicine", "and, slowly, i got healthier and healthier and healthier, and more and more fit, but i was still very heavy, and i was heavy for a long time", "what age were you when you brought him into your house", "or how long ago was this", "i'm gonna guess i was probably late 30's  and, how old are you, if you don't mind me asking, how old are you", "yeah, it was about 10 years ago, 10, 12 years agosomething like that", "so, you were changing your diet", "what were some of the other things that he had you change", "he had me do 20 minutes of low heart rate exercise, aerobic activity, every day, and he had me start wearing a heartrate monitor", "and, my heartrate, i would get into - for me, walking up a flight of stairs would be an aerobic activity", "so, i had to really watch what i was doing, to stay - sorry, anaerobic activity, yeah", "i had to work hard to stay in the anaerobic space", "the aerobic space, you mean", "yeah, the aerobic space", "it's getting hot in here", "yeah, it is getting hot in here", "time to take off all your clothes", "my hand's burning the mic", "i tried to wrap them in napkins, i remember you did mention, those might get hot", "sorry, so to stay in the aerobic threshold, you had to work very hard  yes", "and, again, my health changed, but i still stayed very heavy", "and, after two years of time, i probably lost a little bit of weight, but not much", "but, i was much healthier, and much more alive, and much better than i was before and, after that period of time, phil said to me, you know, anyone else who made the changes you made, out of everyone he's ever dealt with, 99 percent, out of 100 people, 99 out of 100 people would have dropped all their weightfor some reason, there's something else going on with you, that's holding onto the weight", "so, i kinda of just accepted that that was how it was", "but, at least i felt a lot better, my life was a lot better at the end of the day", "i was a lot happier", "and then, a mentor of mine, whose name is mo ostin, he was a guy who ran warner bros", "records for 35 years, he worked for frank sinatra", "real inspiring guy in the music business", "he suggested - i went out for lunch with him one day, and he said, rick, i'm real worried about you, i know you watch what you eat, and i know that you walk on the beach every day, and you exercise, but you're really getting big, and i'm getting worried, so, he said, i'm gonna get the name of a nutritionist, and i want you to go to my guy, and i want you to do whatever he says", "and, i said, okay, fine", "and, i knew it wouldn't work, because i knew that my whole life, i had a weight problem, my whole life, i've tried every diet, and nothing ever worked", "but, i would do anything for mo", "so, i went, again, open-minded, but not believing it would workwilling to try, but not believing it would work", "and, the nutritionist put me on a high protein, low calorie diet, and i'd never done a low calorie diet before, and, over 14 months, i lost 130 pounds, 135 pounds", "wow  yeah, and that changed everything, and i will say, if i didn't do the work with phil first, i don't believe that the diet would've worked it was sort of like a combination of things in order", "it was like, the metabolism got turned on, i started being in tune with circadian rhythm, i was stimulating my aerobic system every day", "i built a base, and then, with the right diet, was able to drop the weight quickly  what's so interesting about that, and i have a couple more questions about what the nutritionist prescribed, but in my experience, with say tens of thousands of readers, following various diets, including this low-carb diet, it makes perfect sense, because you're adding things in, in the beginning, as opposed to having everything prohibited,   and, you're adding elements in, and then, once you've added those lifestyle components, at that point, you're able to change the diet, and then, experience the - wow, that is hot", "it is hot, i was gonna say, even with phil, though, i changed my diet, it just was - you know, almond butter was something that i was allowed to eat, because in phil's world, almond butter is healthy", "so, i probably ate two thirds of a jar of almond butter every day  that's my issue with things like almond butter, domino foods", "exactly", "phil has a belief, and so many people have a belief that calories don't count, and i understand that", "but, if you eat 10,000 calories a day -  right", "you're probably gonna gain weight, you're not gonna lose weight", "exactly", "so, it's like, there is a point, where calories do make a difference  oh, absolutely if it's a question of between 4,500, and 5,000 calories, like, okay, yes, bourbon calories, sugar calories and fat calories are very different", "but, if you're eating 10,000 calories of almond butter before you go to bed, which i will do, if i have almond butter in my house, then best not to have it in my house", "so, when you lost the 130, 140 pounds, over that period of time, how many meals were you eating per day, and how many of them were whole food versus liquid", "to lose the weight, i was having seven protein shakes a day, that were high protein, they were like, egg protein, j-rob egg protein was one of them", "terra's whey, whey protein was another", "did you alternate those, or combine them", "no, at first, i did only egg, and then the whey came later", "and, at first, i couldn't tolerate the whey, for some reason, the whey made me uncomfortable, once i lost a bunch of weight, i could eat the whey", "so, egg was first", "that also makes sense, i mean, having any amount of dairy or lactose reintroduced, after being vegan for such a long period of time", "a lot of people i've noticed who try to reintroduce animal proteins feel sick, but it's because they lack the enzymes, at that point, after say ten years of not consuming meat, to digest it properly  do you wanna do an ice round, or do you want me to do an ice round", "because i feel like i'm getting close", "yeah, i'd say, why don't you do an ice round, because you're at higher elevation", "i'm sitting on the floor, for those people who can't see", "yeah, this is no joke", "it's not even 200", "it's not even 200, it's about 190 - holy crap, 195 degrees in herealright, so -  but, hopefully, it'll get up to about 220  oh, good lord, 220, that's a well done steak right there, that's very well done", "alright", "i will hang out in here, and i will see you out there in a minute", "i'm holding both mics now, sitting on the floor, two containers of water, and i have a russian spa hat on, they make you look somewhat like keebler elves, and mine has a lion on it", "and, i have to only guess that the cyrillic says spa lion, which is appropriate, because i think of myself as a spa lion", "on a related note, folks, if i do die of heatstroke, it's been lovely knowing you, and i'm going to press stop now, to save my breath for the ice round.iand, we're back", "refreshed after some - i think we're getting colder, adding ice, but it was about 44 degrees fahrenheit", "so, rick, you had mentioned this gent, or lady, or doctor from uclawho was that", "the doctor at ucla, who helped me lose the weight was dr", "heber, h, e, b, e, r", "and, he's really, of everything i tried, nothing ever worked, until dr", "heber", "and, do you still follow the general diet, or have you been able to, after losing that weight, modify that", "i've modified it, in that i still eat a lot of protein, and don't have any grain", "yeah, really no carbs, and i keep - while i probably don't restrict calories as much as i did in the weight loss phase, i'm aware of it", "i'm aware of them, and don't let them get out of control,  right, you've developed a sensitivity, or an awareness", "right", "and, for a period of time, i used an app, i think it was called fitness pal, if i can remember correctly, where you put in all the food you eat, and it tells you the calories, and just kinda keep a log,   and, what was just kinda helpful about it was, if you pay attention to calories for, let's say a year, you then really have a sense of where the calories are hidden, and you just have better habits   absolutely", "if you're trying to get into say, ketosis, or following something like the atkins diet, for instance, you develop a sensitivity to hidden sugars and carbs", "absolutely", "and sort of net carbohydrates", "so, i'd love to sort of shift gears a little bit, and ask you about music producing", "let's perhaps take even a step back, and ask, when people ask you what you do, how do you answer that question", "i don't know how to answer that question", "you don't know how to answer", "no.so, what does a - let's perhaps start with definitions then", "what does a music producer do, for those who don't know what -  well, i don't know what music producers do  okay", "i can tell you what i do", "okay, let's do that  which is, i help get the best performance from an artist, help them pick their material, or develop their material, and help set the course of what they're doing creatively  and, how did you end up becoming initially involved with that type of work", "i don't know how you usually do, and i guess you can do it in many different ways", "some people might start as a recording engineer, and then graduate to a record producersome people might be successful artists, and then transition into being record producers", "in my case, i was just really a fan of music, and i come at it from the point of view of being a fan", "what did you study at nyu", "i started as a philosophy major, then after two years, switched to film and television, because all of my friends were in film and television, it just seemed like more fun  was it more fun", "it was", "i think it's natalie maynard, the dixie chicks, has said, and this is paraphrasing, but that you let music be discovered, not manufactured", "what does she mean by that, or what do you think she means by that", "well, we have a whole process", "you know, it's different for every artist, but we try to go on a journey, and let the artist discover who they are, and in the process, the best art comes from them", "it's like getting to be their true selves, and trying to take away all of the -   there are so many things that get in the way of the artistic process for example, any commercial considerations usually get in the way if you're thinking about making music that's gonna get on the radio, chances are, you won't be using your own voice to its most potent, most singular - finding what your personal gift is", "so, that's one of many things", "getting closer to the source, and not getting distracted by any nonsense that could get in the way of the art being as good as it could be", "what are other things that get in the way of artist producing their best work", "concern about what other people think", "competition, wanting to do better than someone else", "let's see, what are the things", "self-doubt, ego", "what manifestation of ego", "if someone thinks that everything they do is great, they might not be willing to edit themselves enough, or work hard enough at - if i can write ten great songs, five minutes each, and those are the best songs, and i'm just gonna record them and put them out, then those might not be as good as the ones you develop over a long period of time, for example", "that might be an egotistical artist, who thinks everything i do is just great", "when you have the opposite, when you have an artist who's doubting themselves, how do you help them through that, or what do you recommend", "i have a lot - but speaking personally, i have continuous self-doubt", "as a writer  i think most artists do", "more typically, self-doubt is the case", "i think if your goal is to be better than you were, you know, if you're competing only with yourself, it's a more realistic place to be", "if you say, i don't want to write songs unless i can write songs better than the beatles; it's a very hard road", "but, if you say, i want to write a better song tomorrow than the song i wrote yesterday, that's a realistic - that's something that can be done", "and, if you write a better song than you wrote yesterday every day, then you continue to get better and better and better, and it really is small steps, and also, trying not to think so much", "because so much of it is - the job is - it's more emotion and heartwork than it is headwork", "like, the head comes in after, to look at what the heart has presented, and to organize itbut, the initial inspiration comes from a different place, and it's not the head, and it's not an intellectual activity", "it's more inspiration", "so, the key, first, is to really do whatever activities you can -   to tune into inspiration, and things like meditating help", "and, diving into art in general", "it doesn't even have to be your modalityi mean, going to museums and looking at beautiful art can help you write better songs", "reading great novels, reading great works of art, seeing a great movie could inspire a great song", "reading poetry, so, i'd say, being in - submerging yourself in great art, and the more you can do to get out of the mode of competition, where you're looking at what other people are doing, and wanting to be better than them, or be inspired by them", "i'd say the only way to use the inspiration of other artists is if you submerge yourself in the greatest works of all time", "which is a great thing to do, like, if you listen to the greatest music ever made", "that would be a better way to work through to find your own voice, to matter today, than listening to what's on the radio now, and thinking i wanna compete with this  right", "so, it's more of like, a stepping back, and looking at a bigger picture than what's going on at the moment", "as someone who is not well versed in music - i don't feel highly literate when it comes to music", "i enjoy music", "but, hanging out with you and neil strauss certainly, i feel like i'm lacking perhaps a vocabulary, and a lot of references", "are there any - for people who feel like they're in my shoes, are there any particular albums that you could offer as a starting point", "not the end all be all, just a starting point for appreciating good, contemporary music", "meaning, not necessarily - could be classical music but are there any that you could -  yeah, i would just start by listening to the greats, which you can look up", "if you search online for mojo's top 100 albums of all time, or rolling stone's top 100 albums, or any trusted source's top 100 albums, and start listening to what are considered the greats", "it's a good place to start", "and, are there any particular stories that you have, that come to mind, of experiences outside of the medium of music, say a specific film, or a specific trip, or a specific book, that catalyzed a breakthrough in the work that you did", "let me think about that for a sec", "i wouldn't say breakthrough", "because it's a more personal thing than that, so it doesn't come as much from the outside, but i get inspiration every day, from either what i'm reading, or watching a sunset, or noticing the number of birds that fly overhead, and their different shapes and what they look like, or paying attention, and hearing the sound of the wavesall of those things speak to - or, looking at the horizon, they all speak to me", "and, so much of the work we try to do is to create something with the natural balance that we see in nature", "that's sort of the perfect version of - if you can make a piece of music that can take your breath away as much as a beautiful sunset, you've done well", "so, any opportunity to see dolphins swim, or to see something beautiful, that's not your run of the mill experience", "or, even, could be a beautiful, cloud-filled sky", "or, on a particularly clear night, when you can really see lots of stars", "those are all inspiring things, and help turn on the muse of recognizing kind of a greater vision of either what's possible, or what's beautiful than something that you see in a magazine, that's there as an advertisement to entice you to buy it", "right", "and, can you talk a little bit about, when did you realize that you were good at working with musicians, or music", "when did that happen", "yeah", "when did that happen, and are there any particular, whether it's instances or artists where you thought, wow, i might actually have a knack for this", "well, right from the beginning, i started having a lot of success, and i did it - i really made music as a hobby, while i was in college, and i thought i would have a real job, and make music as a hobby", "and, i thought i would have a job to support my music habit", "and then, the first album i produced was by ll cool j", "he was 16 at the time, and i think it cost us about $8,000.00 to recordit sold 900,000 copies", "which was a good start", "that is a good start.and then, the second one was beastie boys, which i think sold 9 or 10 million", "so, from then on, just a lot of records, sold a lot of records right from the beginning   so, it - i'll say it took a long time for me to understand that that doesn't always happen, it's an unusual series of events", "but, a long time, of working with a lot of artists, and seeing a lot of success, it became clear that i could support artists in doing good work, and people seem to appreciate it", "what are some of the things - what are some of the ways or characteristics that make you different than perhaps other people who work with musicians", "well, it's hard to say, because i don't know so much what other people do, but i don't think we do the same thing", "there are some producers who make beats for artists, and there was a time in my career when i did that, early in my career i did that", "still will do that, if it makes sense with the project that i'm doing", "i think it's unusual that i get to work in lots of different genres, and get to make heavy metal records, and rap records, and country records, and spiritual records, all different kinds", "i think that's unusual and just lucky, and i think that might come from the fact that i come from that fan perspective, and i like all kinds of music, and i get to examine them, and the fact that i've been able to work on so many different kinds of music over such a long period of time gives me a good perspective, because when i come into a new project, it's not -   it's rare that i'm going to the studio to work on another of what i was just working on", "so, let's say, for example, i was a heavy metal producer, and all i did for the last 30 years was produce heavy metal, i don't know how fresh those records would be today", "but now, if i get to produce a heavy metal record, like, the last one i did would be, i guess the last black sabbath album, it was really fun, because i hadn't made a record like that in a long time, and it was a brand new experience", "that's 13", "13 was the last one, yep", "and, it was a great experience", "never worked with those guys before, and we had a great time", "so, i'm not sure if i ever told you, the first time i ever saw the name rick rubin was on the inside of an audio cassette", "it was the first heavy metal album i ever bought, which was reign in blood", "oh, it's a good one", "that's a really good one", "and, i just remember, not having - this is pre-internet, of course, and i was just told by my friends, you will love heavy metal, you should listen to heavy metal, and i asked what the hardest heavy metal was that could possibly be found, and reign in blood came to the lips of those i asked", "and, i just remember listening to, i think it's angel of death, the first track on that album, and going, oh my god, what have i gotten myself into", "and just fell in love with that band", "but, how did you go from hiphop to say, slayer, it's so stylistically different, it would seem, but how did slayer come about", "yeah", "as i said, because i was coming about it with no technical skill, i didn't know anything about hiphop or heavy metal, i was a fan of music, and i loved heavy metal, and i loved hiphop, so it was more just coming at it from an appreciation, and as a fan, knowing what i wanted to hear", "especially in the case of slayerslayer were an underground metal band, who had two albums out on an independent label, and were kind of considered the heaviest band in the world", "and, when we signed them, there was this terrible fear, that slayer, they were doing their first album for a major label, they were gonna sell out", "get watered down", "yeah, which happens all the time", "and then, the album that we made, reign in blood, was much harder, and worse than anything that anyone had ever heard before   and, it really did come from that, i always liked extreme things, and they were extreme, and i wanted to maximize it", "i didn't want to water down - the idea of watering things down for a mainstream audience, i don't think it applies", "i think people want things that are really passionate, and the best version they could be, and often, the best version they could be is not for everybody", "right", "the best art divides the audience, where if you put out a record, and half the people who hear it absolutely love it, and half the people who hear it absolutely hate it, you've done well, because it's pushing that boundary", "if everyone thinks, oh, that's pretty good, why bother making it", "it almost - it doesn't mean as much,  lost in the slipstream of time, almost as soon as it comes out  i'm gonna do a round of ice, if that's alright", "absolutely alright", "let's do some ice, and we'll be back", "okay, we are back, and i'd love to talk a little bit about ll cool j versus for instance, slayer", "is the way in which you work with those two groups of creatives - or, in the case of ll cool j, i don't know how many people were involved on his side, but is there a different approach, when giving feedback, when trying to cultivate their ability", "i'd say it's really different with every single artist, and it's - you spend time with the artist, you get to know them, and if you listen to people, if you really listen to what people say, usually, they tell you everything", "if you really listen and pay attention to what people are saying, they'll let you know a lot of stuff   and, i just really pay attention to what people say, and then through that, i can then reflect back thoughts that they've told me about themselves, and that they don't know about themselvesand, allow them to unlock those doors, to allow them to go to the places where they wanna go, artistically are there any particular examples of that, or a story that you could share", "hmm", "the first story that comes to mind isn't related to my music work, but it's related to our friend neil, and just the journey that's led to his new book, that's about to come out", "it started through him complaining about something going on in his life -   that was something that he thought he wanted in his life, and i don't think he knew that the thing that he wanted was making him unhappy", "and, through that conversation, he decided to examine that", "same as that", "that'd be the first one that came to mind, maybe because we both know neil", "rightyou seem very philosophically minded, very calm, and i should thank you, also", "you and a friend named chase jarvits, he's a world-class photographer, are actually the people who got me into meditation consistently, with tm", "so, thank you for that", "but, have you always been very calm", "and, you seem very unperturbed, very unfazed, by anything that i've observed", "is that an illusion, or have you always been that way", "i'm very lucky that i learned the meditate when i was young, so i started meditating when i was 14, and i meditated a lot for a long time, and through that, i think it has really - even though i'm not always calm on the inside, it has at least given me an air of calm, and maybe comparative to other people, i'm calm", "i know sometimes, internally, i can get disrupted  what do you do when you get disrupted", "i try to do something", "often, exercise will make me feel better, meditating will make me feel better, the ice bath is the greatest of all", "the king of all mood elevators", "it's just magic, sauna/ice, back and forth", "at the end of the fourth, or fifth, or sixth round of being in an ice tub, there is nothing in the world that bothers you", "it's true, it's very true  it's just like, the world's a great place", "what are the types of things that disrupt you", "are there any particular patterns", "i would say usually work things, or political related - you know, political-type things related to work could really bother me", "just when they don't fit into my realm of the way i look at life, so i get surprised by those things  just having to manage the various relationships, say within a label, or something like that", "yeah, i would say more dealing with business people, who can often like, wow, you really think that, you really wanna do things that way", "it's like, surprising", "what are some of the ways in which you've designed your life to, say, not have to content with as much of that as possible", "well, i always really try to focus my life around art", "so, i consider my job - even though there are other parts of my job, i consider my real job, the reason i'm here, is to sit with artists, talk with artists, help artists be better at what they do", "and, if i'm not doing it with an artist, i'm doing it with something else", "it's like, my goal is to make things as good as they could be", "either make - whatever it is, - to the point of where i've gone in to visit friends in their office, and i rearrange the furniture in their inner office, because i'm insane", "it would really look better if you moved these things this way, and you could see the sun coming in through the window here, and if you open these blinds and turn this around, this place would be a lot more comfortable", "when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind", "it's not such an easy question to answer", "because, i mean, so many things go into what makes someone successful", "what are some of those things", "i would start with somebody who's happy", "i know a great many people who are financially successful and not happy, so i would rule all of them out, to start with", "let's see", "it's not coming as easily", "i have to think about that, and we can come back to it", "we can come back to it", "how do you - this is a very self-interested question, but i'll ask it", "so, i'm 37, of course, we've both spent a lot of time around neiland, i'm not gonna spoil the secret, because neil would be apoplectic, but the next book i'm looking forward to -  i just thought of a couple of examples of people who are successful  oh, let's do it", "a good example of someone who is successful is don wildman, our friend from the beach", "whom i still have not met, amazingly", "he's 80 years old, he did 23 pull-ups on the beach the other dayhe's in the senior olympics", "he retired in his 50's, because he wanted to spend his days enjoying life and exercising", "and, he's one of the most inspiring, uplifting, great, successful people, on so many levels", "he'd be probably the first one i think of", "laird's another good example of someone who i would think of as successful, he's a successful human being", "and, that's laird hamilton", "laird hamilton", "for those not familiar with laird, pretty much uncontroversially, i'd say, thought of as the king of big wave surfing, among other things", "yeah, i mean, it's not uncommon to hear him referred to as the greatest athlete on earth", "he's a real - so many athletes of so many disciplines, think of him as the best athlete", "also a king of steam rooms and ice baths", "i started doing the sauna and the ice with laird", "anyway, successful is someone who enjoys their life, is great at what they do, is curious, and continually pushing forward, and wanting to be better than they were yesterday, without beating themselves up about it", "and, what are - don is - his name has come up so many timeswhat are some of the things that you've learned or picked up from him, or adopted for yourself", "he's just seemed so positive, and nothing - it seems like nothing gets to him", "he's - he can push through anything that's in his way, and all the time with a smile on his face, and a positive outlook, and a curious nature", "how - i don't know how many people that are 80, that every time you meet them teach you something about something new they've learned", "because they're so curious about a great article, or a great book, and you have to read this book, and you have to go to see this movie, and you have to do this, and we just came back from snowboarding in alaska, and you have to go see, it was unbelievable", "and, just, he's got a wild life", "that's inspiring", "i've, in the last few years, in particular i'd say last year, with my health scare with lyme disease, and everything that came of that -   tried to surround myself not just with the extremely young athletes and performers, but, for instance, this polish gentleman and his wife, both of whom are world record holders in olympic weight lifting", "but, what's so fascinating is how, i'd say relatively injury-free and mobile they still are, and they're in their, i'd say, early 60's at this point  amazing", "yeah", "and, i've really tried to spend more time in the last couple years modeling what those people do", "do you have a book, or books that you've gifted often to other people", "there are many", "the first one that comes to mind is the tao te ching", "it's the stephen mitchell translation of the tao te chingwhat's great about it is, it's 81 short pieces, that you could look at them as poems, that, if you were to read the book today, you would get one thing from it", "and, if you were to pick it up in two years and read it again, it would mean something entirely different, and always on the money", "always what you need to read at that particular period of time", "so, it's a magic book, in that way, in that it always fits", "i actually took - god, this is bringing back a memory", "i actually took an entire class on the tao te ching at princeton when i was an undergrad in east asian studies", "and, it seems on some level, that that book does what you do for musicians", "meaning that it sort of reflects back truths that they were not aware of themselves, or they could not verbalize themselves", "any other books come to mind", "another one that's really nice is a book about meditation called wherever you go, there you are, which is by john cabot simand, it's a great book if you've never meditated, and if you've been meditating for 50 years", "if you read this book, either way, you'll care more about meditation, become a better meditator, and just give insight into why we do it, and what the benefits are", "do you have any favorite movies, or documentaries", "i watch lots of documentaries, let me think of one that's a favoritejust watched one the other night that was spectacular, new nick cave, the english - well, i guess he's australian, he lives in england", "musician, has a new documentary that's quite an unusual documentary, because it's part documentary and part, i guess, not you have to see it", "but, it's called 20,000 days on earth", "20,000 days on earth  yeahso, that was the last one that just really, like, wow, how great is that", "are there any - have you had any points of overwhelm in your length", "in your length", "that's not a question", "the heat's getting to my head", "in your career", "the heat's getting to you", "yeah, the heat's getting to me", "i have to switch hands, because my hand is burning", "wow", "do you experience overwhelm, or have you", "yes", "i definitely experience overwhelm", "too much going on at one time, or often, it's self-imposed", "or, i make it a point to always be there, as best as i can be for the artists that i work with, and sometimes, their needs can overtake my own needs", "and then, i feel overwhelmed, because i wanna be there for them, and then i find that i'm not taking care of myself", "so, finding that balance", "what do you do in those situations", "when you come to that realization", "when i realize it, i'll usually talk to the artist about it, and explain the situation", "i would say, any situation that feels sticky, if you explain it to the person that it feels sticky with, almost always, it eases very quickly", "and, it brings you closer together", "and, do you explain the situation the way that you just described it to me, or what is the actual -  it just depends on the case, but i might say, i feel really overwhelmed right now, this is what's going on with me", "can we talk about this later, or can we address this, is that okay, or usually talk about it", "how you feeling?getting hot", "you tell me", "i'll let you call the rotation of the guards, when we go to ice", "but, i'm very curious, i remember seeing your -  i burned myself", "i think this is a fine idea", "i will say, i will absolve myself for any hot objects", "but, your cameo in 99 problems", "yes  how did that come about", "i had produced the song for jay, and then, when it was time to make the video, a friend of mine, mark romanek, who's a great video maker, made the video, and i think it was mark's idea", "he said, why don't we get rick in the video", "and jay agreed, and they called and asked if i would come, and i love jay, he's a really great guy, and i thought it would be fun", "what are you proudest of, as it relates to that track", "if it comes to mind, i know you've worked with a lot of tracks  just that jay is one of the most important artists in the world, and that's one of his most popular songs, and that we got to do it together is just really great", "how did you become involved with that song", "or, were you involved with the entire album", "i was involved with that song, we went into the studio together", "it was his last - it was going to be his last album, the black album, his retirement album, and he asked his ten favorite producers to each do one song", "and, we went into the studio, that was the first time we worked together, and we -   we spent a week in the studio, trying different things, and then, eventually came upon this track, and the experimentation, and he loved it", "and, the words came to him sort of magically", "he sat in the back of the room, listened to the track over and over and over again, and after about a half hour he said, i've got it, and jumped up and ran into the other room, and did the vocals, without writing anything down", "so, i've heard this about him before, where at some point, i heard a story that he wrote basically gibberish down on a piece of paper, because someone trying to supervise him earlier in his career was so worried that he wasn't taking the recording session seriouslybut, in fact, he wasn't writing down anything at all, it was just to put them at ease", "and then, freestyled the entire thing", "is that how he operates", "that's how he does it, yeah that's mind-boggling  he's super talented, and just a great person", "one of my favorite people", "what do you like about him", "everything", "he's humble, he's honest, he's a deep soul", "he looks at things deeply", "understands them deeply, is caring, and is just a first rate person", "i think i'm gonna get in the ice", "alright, time to go to the ice", "i'll hit pause, i was right  crazy", "crazy is right", "it adds up", "it does add up", "that was a particularly chilly ice bath, it's now lower than the minimum measurement, which is 40 degrees, so i feel like all the skin below my neck has just contracted by 30 percent", "it's a good feeling", "and, you mentioned this briefly when we were coming in, but who's the first person who introduced you to using a sauna", "yeah, the first sauna that i was in was a local friend of ours, chris chelios, who's a hockey player, and he had the longest professional hockey career of anyone ever", "he continued playing professionally until he was 48 years old, and all of the people on the other teams that he was facing at the time were in their 20's, so he's really an unbelievable athlete", "and, he has done sauna every day of his life, for the last - since he's been playing", "and he believes that the reason he had the longevity in the sport, and he never got sick, and was able to never miss a game, and to play for such a long career, was all due to the sauna, every day", "and, he used hot sauna, he was not alternating between hot and cold", "he did hot and cold, but he wouldn't necessarily use an ice bath, he would do cold showers if not", "but, he would do 15 or 20 minutes in the sauna, cold shower, 15 or 20 minutes in the sauna, round and round", "and, how were you introduced to the ice baths", "the ice baths came from joachim noah, who's my girlfriend's nephew", "and, he bought an ice tub for laird, because laird started doing the sauna, after chris started doing the sauna", "we have a group who would do it on the beach", "chris has a sauna on the beach, so we would do the sauna, even in the wintertime, and then we would jump into the ocean", "and, that was how we did the hot and the cold", "and then, joachim suggested we start using the ice tub, and then we started doing that, and that was - took it to a whole new level", "and you've done some very unusual training, that sounds terrifying to me, underwater, right", "and do you continue to do the underwater training, with weights", "yeah, that's something we'll do with laird, we'll do, like, 50-pound dumbbells, 14 feet underwater, and it's an interesting experience", "like, a lot like getting into the ice bath", "if you're not used to getting into an ice bath, and someone says jump into a tub of ice, you'll probably react negatively  panic", "they panic, and when you're holding a 50-pound weight underwater, your brain goes crazy", "it relates to, okay, weight underwater, you die", "it's like cement shoes", "right", "so, we do all these exercises with weights underwater, it's really interesting", "and, do you - and keep this in mind, folks, don't do this without supervision", "consult your doctor, but what does the technique look like", "well, it started - laird has a pool, that you can start in the shallow end, and walk down to the deep end, and down the center of the pool, there's a staircase, underwater", "so, it started with holding heavy weights and walking from the shallow end to the deep end, and obviously, there's a point where you have to take a big breath and hold it, and then you walk down into the deep end, and you turn around and you walk up the stairs, and make it before you run out of breath", "and, each time you do it, you would make wider and wider circles, and get used to being under longer and longer   and then, we started adding, once we were completely submerged, start adding maybe curls, or shoulder presses, and start doing those underwater, and one day, after we'd been doing this about a year -   laird came into the gym one day, and he said i had a dream last night, that if we use lighter weights, they'll be heavy enough to keep us down, but light enough to where we could jump up to the top", "in the deep end", "in the deep end, so you'd be down in the deep end", "so, now, instead of doing one rep, and recovering, which was all we could do before", "we could do one round, basically", "and then you'd be in the shallow end and recover", "and then, we started doing these exercises with jumping, so we'd start with, maybe, 15 pound dumbbells, and you would hold two 15-pound dumbbells, jump into the deep end, sink to the bottom, and then jump as hard as you can, holding your arms above your head, and then, kinda do one stroke, pulling your arms down to the sides, holding the dumbbells", "and, it was just enough to get your head out, and you gasp for a breath, and then you'd sink, and we'd do that over, and over, and over again", "at first, maybe the goal would be to do ten in a row, and it'd be really a big deal, and we could do ten in a row", "and then, over time, we worked up to being able to do 100 in a rowand then, doing it with heavier weights", "and then, since then, laird's come up with maybe 50 exercises that we do with weights   underwater", "either underwater or in water", "and, while -  he dreams up some really fascinating not only exercises but devices", "for those people who haven't see, the foilboard, is that what it is?the foilboard's amazing", "the foilboard, yeah", "people can google foilboard", "he invented standup paddling, really", "he invented standup paddling, he invented tow-in surfing", "he's an amazing, he's got an amazing analytical mind  do you think, did he develop that, in any particular way", "the mind", "the analytical mind", "i think he's very mechanical, to start with, i think it starts with that, and he's willing to try things, and fail at things, to be able to get to do something", "so, he - the first day i went to his gym, i couldn't do one push up, and really, it was through his belief, and his inspiration that i was able to learn all of the things i was able to learn with him", "and, i remember, he showed me one exercise, i couldn't do it at all, and i said, i can't do that", "and, he said, no, don't say you can't do it, say you haven't done it yet", "and, he'd say okay, let's divide it into three pieces", "do the first third of the exercise, and i could do the first third", "do the last third of the exercise, and i could do that", "now, do the middle third by itself, and i could do that", "and, he said, now put the first two pieces together", "and i could do that", "and then, put the second and third piece together, and i could do that", "and then, eventually, i could do the whole exercise", "at first, it seemed impossible, but he walked me through it, and -  broke it down for you  yeah", "just taught me how to see past the limitations that i put on myself", "what was the exercise", "do you recall what that was", "that might have been a jump through, like a burpee with weightshe would let you do a shoulder press -   and then you'd put the weights down on the ground, hold them, hold the dumbbells, and then jump back into a pushup position, then jump up and slide your legs forward through", "right, right  and then, jump up into a squat position, and that would be one, one round", "that's some intense movement", "what are some of the physical experiments that you're doing these days", "or training protocols that you're experimenting with", "there's always so many, i have to think of what's new and currenti've been doing hyperbaric oxygen, and i really like that", "that's in a chamber", "yeahi do the wim hof breathing technique", "i just started doing, there's a wim hof ten-week course", "you can check online, w, i, m, h, o, f", "just started learning that", "he's a fascinating guy  yeah", "he's really into ice", "i can see", "i've never seen anyone more tolerant of ice", "i think he has a world's record for sitting in a box, a bisquick cube of ice  didn't he climb mount everest, just in swim trunks", "he has some incredible thermoregulatory capabilities  he ran a marathon in the desert with no water, so that was another one", "the two extremes of the heat or the cold", "the guy's a monster, i really wanna get him on the podcast at some point", "he'd be a good one", "let's see, what else", "those are the ones that come to mind at the moment", "how do you, just as laird did for you, when you're working with an artist who believes they can't do something, or is just hitting that wall, what are some of the ways that you help them get past that", "usually, i'll give them homework, a small, doable task", "i'll give you an example", "there was an artist i was working with recently, who hadn't made an album in a long time, and was struggling with finishing anything", "and, just had this - it was a version of a writer's block, but it was - i don't know, hard to explain what it was", "but, i would give him very doable homework assignments, that almost seemed like a joke", "tonight, i want you to write one word, in this song that needs five lines, that you can't finish, i just want one word that you like, by tomorrow, do you think that you could come up with one word", "and, usually, he'd be like yeah, i think i can do one word", "and, just very quickly, by breaking it down into pieces, like i learned from laird, and chipping away, one step at a time, you can really get through anything", "yeah", "breaking it down into manageable bites", "i remember, on the beach, we had a zip line", "not a zip line, you know, the beam that you balance on", "oh, a slackline", "slackline", "and, laird was pretty good at it, in the beginning, but had never done it before", "and, he would work for hours", "he would just be there, hour after hour after hour, falling off and getting back on, falling off and getting back on", "and then, of all of the group of people, he was by far the first one that was able to do it", "and, it wasn't because he naturally was gifted at it", "he knows that anything he sets his mind to learn to do, if he focuses and continues to not mind falling off, and not thinking he's supposed to be good out of the box, learning how to do it, that's how you learn things", "i also will say that, after having the weight problem that i had for so long, and finally finding the solution, and making the change, it really makes me believe that anything's possible", "we can learn, we can train ourselves to do absolutely anything, it's really just getting the right information   if we get the right information, we can learn to do anything", "now, it doesn't mean we can necessarily be the best in the world at something, but we can be our best at that thing", "right", "the best version of ourselves", "yeah, and do things that we never dreamed of as possible for us", "what advice - and i'll ask this for a couple of different ages, but i'll start with 20", "what advice would you give your 20-year-old self, if any", "try to have more fun  why do you think you weren't having as much fun as you could have, at that point", "i think i was more driven, and i don't know, i wanna say that i had something to prove", "i don't know if i did have something to prove, but i felt like doing the work was the most important thing in the world, as opposed to doing the work and enjoying the process, and feeling what it was -   being able to step back, and see what it was, not just be so deeply into it that - i feel like i missed a lot of years of my life, because i was just in a dark room, working on music", "seven days a week for 20 years", "wow", "i recall, that makes me think of a story from neil gaiman, the writer", "when he - i think it was with the success of sandman, and he was in a huge line of readers who wanted signatures, and fans who wanted to tell him stories, and stephen king pulled him aside and just said enjoy it", "and he didn't, he was too caught up in the flow", "what about your 30-year-old self", "what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self", "i guess i might tell myself something that still might apply to me today", "i wouldn't have known it then at all, i know it now, it's just not second nature   but, to be kinder to myself, because i think i've beaten myself up a lot, because i expect a lot from myself, i'll be hard on myself, and i don't know that i'm doing anyone any good by doing that  that's advice that i need to give myself", "when do you tend to beat yourself up", "i've made somewhat of a sport of it, it would seem", "yeah", "it could happen anytime, i could come up with anything that i could be doing to further something, and didn't already think of it, and didn't already do it, i might beat myself up about why have i not done that", "now, something that i struggle with, that i'd love to get your two cents on -", "is related to this, which is, on one hand, i don't wanna beat myself up, on the other hand, i feel like the perfectionism that i have has enabled me to achieve whatever modicum of success i've been able to achieve", "i've heard stories about, and you can correct me if i'm wrong, but zz top and la futura, and how they worked on it with you for\u00e9 i wanna say 2008 to 2012, but how they realized the value of you wanting the art to be as perfect as it could be, or the best it could be, and taking whatever time and pains necessary to make that possible", "so, i'd love to hear your thoughts on that", "i wanna be easier on myself, but i worry that if i do that, i will lose whatever magic, if there is such a thing, that enables me to do what i do", "yeah", "i think that, ultimately, the - i think that's a myth, and i think that your take on things is specific to you, and it's not because of your - it's almost like you've won the war, and to accept the fact that you've won the war, you have an audiencepeople are willing to hear what you are interested in, what you're interested in learning about, and what you wanna share", "and, you can do that without killing yourself", "and, that killing yourself won't be of service, neither to you or your audience", "i gotta get in the ice", "all right, let's - this has been great, let's call a close to this", "is there any last parting advice or comment that you'd like to make before we sign off", "i think it's too hot for me to even - i don't know what happening now", "what's up or down", "yeah", "i'm very confused at the moment", "but, i know that this ice bath is gonna change everything for the better  alright, well, on that note, thanks so much, rick", "thank you", "we'll both get some ice", "i'll let you get out first   until next time, thank you for listening.i"]}
