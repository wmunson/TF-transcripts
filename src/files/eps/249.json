Oui, oui. This is Tim Ferriss recording in Montreal, Quebec. The Tim Ferriss Show, each and every episode is focused on deconstructing world-class performers from all different fields. This episode features Blake Mycoskie. You can say hi to Blake on the socials, Twitter and so on, @BlakeMycoskie. We\u2019ve known each other for quite a few years. Blake is the founder and Chief Shoe Giver of Toms. That makes him the person behind the one-for-one business model, which helps a person in need with every product that is purchased. But there are many, many stats and some very impressive numbers related to his bio and his business. We will get to that shortly. I\u2019m going to keep this initial intro very short. In this episode, we cover a lot. We talked about early entrepreneurial ventures, the power of journaling, how the stool analogy changed Blake\u2019s life, lessons from Ben Franklin, and much more. This episode comes from my new television show Fear(less), 10 episodes. It\u2019s a full season where I interview world-class performers on stage in front of a studio audience about how they\u2019ve overcome doubt, conquered fear, and made their hardest decisions. You can watch the entire first episode of this TV show, Fear(less), with illusionist David Blaine, where he actually performs magic on stage with guests from the audience as well. You can watch that for free at ATT.net/fearless. To watch all of the episodes and a lot of them are physical or involved demos on stage, please visit directvnow.com. Only one T in that. Or you can go to Tim.blog/fearless. We recorded three hours of material for this particular session with Blake. All of it was awesome. We used one hour for TV. So this podcast episode is not a duplicate. It is almost entirely brand-new content that did not appear on television. I hope you enjoy this chat as much as I did with Blake Mycoskie. Welcome to Fear(less). I\u2019m your host, Tim Ferriss. On this stage, we\u2019ll be deconstructing world-class performers of all different types to uncover the specific tactics and strategies they\u2019ve used to overcome doubt, tackle their hardest decisions, and ultimately succeed on their own terms. By a show of hands, how many of you guys own a few pairs of shoes? That is everybody in the room. How many of you own around ten pairs of shoes? More than half. How many of you do not own a single pair of shoes? All right, that\u2019s a big fat zero. My guest tonight has built a company that\u2019s given away more than 60 million pairs of shoes to those who need them most. During a trip to South America, he recognized a unique opportunity to blend business and philanthropy. Since its founding, Toms has given away millions of shoes, helped restore eyesight, and provided safe drinking water to those in need across the globe. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the founder of Toms, Blake Mycoskie. How did your Mom and Dad differ in terms of parenting styles? Blake Mycoskie: That\u2019s a good question. I think my Dad was more serious and in more kind of intellectual in the things that he taught us. I think my Mom was much more hands on, caring. They both were very caring, but I think that my Mom\u2019s was just over attentive. I was the first child. I think the first child gets that, no matter what family it is, because the parents are so afraid of messing up. I know I am. I have a two-year-old. But my Dad was always kind of like the moral \u2013 he was the true north in the family. He was a disciplinarian when that needed to happen. He was the intellectual, I would say. But what was interesting was when my Mom became this best-selling author and every publishing company in the world is flying to Arlington, Texas to try to court her. Then my Dad was realizing like wow, this is totally changing our family\u2019s financial lives. The coolest thing I think I learned from my Dad was he cut down on his practice 50 percent, starting supporting her, traveling with her, going to do the talk shows, infomercials. It was a total role reversal. I think that really taught me a lot about relationships because it was such a beautiful thing to see. Even though I wasn\u2019t understanding all of what I was seeing at that age. But now, she was there putting him through medical school. My parents literally used to sell their blood to go pay their rent, they were so poor during medical school. They have all these stories of being in New Orleans at Tulane and my Mom always says my Dad would get more money for his blood because it was more rare than hers and that used to piss her off. I recall all these things. She was working as a waitress and working here and there and everything to put him through medical school. It was all about his career for the longest time. The moment that my Mom created something and it had so much energy, instead of him being threatened by that, which I think a lot of men would have been, he said, \u201cThis is amazing. It\u2019s your turn now.\u201d My parents have been married for 47 years. They deserve it. I think that was something, seeing that was another part of that whole experience that really had a big impression on me. Not only what my Mom created, but the support my Dad played in it. Tim Ferriss: Was the cookie stand your first business experience? Blake Mycoskie: I think so. That seems like such a clich\u00e9, doesn\u2019t it? There you go. That was early day cookies. I was a little older when I was selling them myself, but I was trained at a young age. It is almost like one of those \u2013 I feel like there\u2019s some great clich\u00e9s in entrepreneurship and they\u2019re clich\u00e9s for a reason. Like having your first business be the lemonade stand or the cookie stand \u2013 you hear that. But yeah, at a little older age than that, my Mom made these amazing cookies. I recognized \u2013 my Grandmother lived on a golf course and so on Saturdays and Sundays, you have hundreds of people who mostly know my Grandmother, who was a real character, coming through the golf course. So if I sat there right on the eighth hole, I think she was on the green, and I was dressed cute and all that, I could sell anything, right? The great thing about this business model was is could convince my Mom to make all the cookies but did not charge me for making them. So I had zero cost to goods sold, 100 percent profit margins. Tim Ferriss: Your Mom is a terrible cookie supplier. Blake Mycoskie: Yeah. It was a fantastic business while it lasted. I did that a couple summers, so I built up some clientele. They liked the cookies so much that they wouldn\u2019t just buy them for that eating occasion, they would buy them and put in the freezer to have for weeks. I had a pretty good thing going. I think that was when I was like nine or ten. That was the first, I think, entrepreneurial venture. The second one was \u2013 and very few people know because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really been that public. My Dad, when I was 18, freshman year in college, at this point I had never had a real job, as my Dad says. I was training to be a professional tennis player, so every single day after school, I trained from 3:30 until literally bedtime and I was incredibly obsessed with tennis. My parents totally supported that. But then when I went to college, I was playing college tennis and I remember my Dad, after the season was over, he said, \u201cThis summer I really think you need to get a job.\u201d I had a younger brother and sister and they were eight years younger and four years younger. They had jobs at the dry cleaner or the clothing store at the mall and all these different places and they were much younger than me. My Dad\u2019s like, you\u2019ve got a college scholarship, you\u2019re doing your thing, but this summer you need to have a job. I was like okay. I wasn\u2019t really excited about that, but I said fine. It wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t like to work. I worked really hard, but I worked hard on something I cared about and that was tennis. So I talked to people and said, \u201cHow can you make the most amount of money when you\u2019re 18 years old in a part-time job?\u201d Because I still needed to practice tennis. The answer I got time and time again was to get a job at a restaurant that had high price points, but a pretty quick turnover. So not fine dining, but a more expensive restaurant than fast service. Tim Ferriss: Who were you asking for advice? Blake Mycoskie: I was asking anyone in college that I thought was older than me that had made some money or that had any form of work experience. Friends of mine who were older than me in school had done that and some of them were even putting themselves through school that way. There is this restaurant called Pappadeaux in Texas. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been there. It\u2019s seafood. Anyway, it\u2019s pretty expensive, but the tables turn fast. So I went and even though I had no experience \u2013 for some people, this is their career. This isn\u2019t a part-time job. It\u2019s that good of a restaurant job. But luckily, the hiring manager was a huge tennis fan. We talked about tennis. She played in college at a rival school than I was playing at and all this. I was like, I can do this job. I really had to sell her on me doing it. So I got the job. I came home and I said to my Dad, \u201cI got a job.\u201d Not only a job, but a job that I\u2019m going to make a lot of money this summer. The next part if you work in a restaurant is memorizing the menu. I had memorizing things. That is the worst for me. Studying and cramming for tests is not my thing. After two or three days of this, I was like, this is miserable. I\u2019m not going to be able to memorize this menu. And I found out that you don\u2019t even get paid the first two weeks because it\u2019s training. My summer is only like nine weeks long. I\u2019m like, that\u2019s 15 percent that I\u2019m not getting paid. So this is sounding less and less appealing every day. This is where the moment came, I think this was when my truly first entrepreneurial synapses went off in my brain. Next to our house, there was a tennis court. I clearly learned to become a great tennis player. I knew there were a lot of kids in our neighborhood that could use tennis lessons. Maybe even some other adults who wanted tennis lessons. We had this tennis court we could use any time. I knew how much my parents paid for tennis lessons for me growing up. It was a huge investment for me. I said before I got into work this weekend, I made these flyers. I put SMU College Tennis Player Training for Next Eight Weeks \u2013 Kids, Adults, Classes, the whole thing. The same way as you\u2019d see at a country club. I made 5,000 flyers. I put them \u2013 it literally took me two days \u2013 in every single mailbox in the entire neighborhood. At that point, I had my own phone line. I changed my voicemail to like Blake\u2019s Tennis Camp or something. I started getting calls. Within a week, I had every hour of the day booked. Instead of making \u2013 I think at Pappadeaux with tips and stuff, I had averaged where I was going to be making like $14.00 or $15.00 an hour, which would\u2019ve been really good back then. Teaching tennis, because I had each kid paying $15.00 an hour and I had five kids at a time, I was making like $80.00 an hour. I had this set up. My Dad came home, he thought I was supposed to be at work at Pappadeaux. He sees me teaching a whole group of kids and my Mom delivering cookies and lemonade to their parents, and he does, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d I said, \u201cThis is still a job and I\u2019m making four times the money that I was.\u201d So that was the moment where I started my entrepreneurial journey. Tim Ferriss: Did your Dad want you to get a job to earn money or was it because he wanted you to have the experience of reporting to someone else and all that? Blake Mycoskie: Clearly it was the latter, but I trumped him with earning \u2013 he couldn\u2019t argue with an 18-year-old making $80.00 an hour. It was crazy. Every time I\u2019m on a airplane, the first thing I do, if it\u2019s not getting a cup of coffee, is start journaling. I have a massive safe in my office that has hundreds and hundreds of journals. We\u2019re actually making a documentary film about the whole Toms experience. A big part of the film is going back and just grabbing random journals and reading these entries. You\u2019re like, I can\u2019t believe I was saying this or thinking this. Because you tend \u2013 or I tended to be \u2013 even though I confess all my fears, I tended to use the journal as a way of positively setting the tone for the next day, the next week, the next month. It\u2019s something that I love doing and it\u2019s something I\u2019m really glad I did. I think it helps me understand my life, which I think is good, because understanding your past is how you can really be more proactive for your future. Tim Ferriss: So this is a shared habit. I have probably about eight bookshelves worth of journals. I\u2019ve kept them all since around the same age, 15, 16. But it started with weightlifting \u2013 same thing. I wanted to track my progress and to be able to understand what worked and what didn\u2019t and so on. It\u2019s turned into what I\u2019ve heard described, I think her name is Julia Cameron \u2013 she wrote a book called The Artist\u2019s Way. She described journaling, the first type, the confessional, as spiritual windshield wipers. Meaning you get that down, especially in the morning \u2013 and the way I look at it is sort of trapping my monkey mind and my anxieties on the page so that I can get on with the day. The morning journaling habit was actually introduced to me by \u2013 by the way guys, the morning journaling specifically isn\u2019t something I started until about three years ago. I think as a lot of people, I had been journaling for a long time and then I stopped for a while. I would only use it for goal setting. But I didn\u2019t do that other part, which I think is so critical. I was like, that\u2019s like the rah-rah positive thinking. I don\u2019t want to even get involved, The Secret, whatever. I don\u2019t want to deal with it. I then ran into a guy named Brian Koppelman, who\u2019s a screenwriter. Along with his partner, they did The Illusionist, A Solitary Man, Ocean\u2019s Thirteen, Billions (the co-creators of that show, which is a current huge hit). He does it every morning. He said, \u201cYou have to start morning journaling.\u201d Since it was coming from him, I started and it was immediate the difference in not just my performance, but also my wellbeing. Blake Mycoskie: I think, and I haven\u2019t heard the spiritual windshield wiper, which I like, that term, is that\u2019s what it kind of does for me. Anything that is controlling my thoughts, stress-related or I feel like I have too many things on my mind or my to-do list or everything. Once I get it on the page, then I can just singularly focus on the most important things of the day. I know you\u2019ve spoken about do the two most important things right away in your day and by journaling, (a) it helps me organize what are those really important things. Because when you\u2019re writing about it, whatever\u2019s getting the most attention typically is the thing you don\u2019t want to have to do but you need to do. But it really does, I think, help you clean your day. And then at the end of the day too, I think it also can serve as a way to allow yourself to relax and get ready for bed and get over with the day if you\u2019ve had some stuff on your mind. It\u2019s interesting by writing it, you think you make it even more something you\u2019d be thinking about, but I find once I\u2019ve written it and I let it go and I close the book, the problems are in the book and they\u2019re no longer with me anymore. If it\u2019s a positive thing, but I think it\u2019s just potentially reinforcing that. I\u2019ll never forget this. It\u2019s so interesting how going back to these little moments in your life that can really change your trajectory and oftentimes it can be someone that you meet or you listen to or a book you read. There is a guy named Bob Dedman. Bob Dedman has passed now. He was a self-made billionaire and he gave more money to SMU and University of Texas than anyone ever. He literally grew up in a trailer park. He started off as a lawyer and then ultimately where he made his real fortune was he recognized that country clubs were becoming more and more popular in the \u201870s and the \u201880s. But it was very expensive to maintain the golf course and the restaurant and everything. You made money by selling the real estate around it. What he started doing was creating clubs with multiple courses but one crew that could service multiple courses. So now you only need one greens keeper for three clubs and three times the amount of real estate sales, one kitchen, all these things. It became this thing called ClubCorp. When he passed away, he was the largest owner of golf courses and tennis courts in the world. He this amazing guy. He lived in Dallas, Texas. He loved tennis. So he\u2019d come out and watch our tennis matches. He was an eccentric billionaire guy who\u2019d watch our tennis matches. For whatever reason, I forget what it was \u2013 I think it was raining and we couldn\u2019t practice that day. Our coach said, \u201cYou guys have seen Mr. Dedman many times watching the matches. Since it\u2019s raining today, we can\u2019t practice. We\u2019re going to watch a video of a commencement speech that he gave for the MBA program at the University of Texas a couple weeks ago. Just so you can have some more frame of reference of how wise this guy is.\u201d The speech was basically about having a life path and thinking of your life as a stool. Every stool has three or four legs. What are going to be the legs of your life? What\u2019s going to be your path? One is your talents. One is your interests. All these different things. I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was. I remember leaving that day and I just heard myself thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t think my stool is going to be a professional tennis player. I actually think my life is about other things.\u201d I started recognizing these talents. Definitely self-discipline and all these different things. I remember watching that video and having peace at the idea of not continuing down this tennis path. Another great Ben Franklin story that I\u2019ve read that actually had a huge impact on early days at Toms \u2013 I was reading a biography, one of the many written. When he had the Farmers\u2019 Almanac. A lot of people don\u2019t recognize that was how he made his first fortune was through the Almanac. Most of the things we know Ben Franklin for actually happened after he retired at age 40. He sold the Farmers\u2019 Almanac, had money at the time, retired. And then all his inventions then came out of the curiosities afterwards. One of my favorite stories was there was this person that would advertise in the Farmers\u2019 Almanac. Ben Franklin did not agree with this ethics and his morals and his ideals, but he needed to take advertising money to keep his Almanac going. So what he decided to do was that night, instead of sleeping in his bed in his home, he slept at his office on the floor with only a piece of bread to eat. He woke up the next morning and he was just as happy as he was the day before. That\u2019s when he said he would never take advertising dollars from someone he didn\u2019t believe in. That was a huge thing with me early with Toms. We will stay 100 percent focused on the mission, whether we make it or not because we\u2019re going to be happier doing it the way we feel is the right thing to do than cutting corners to make extra money. When I read that, that was a huge thing. Tim Ferriss: I was just going to say, not only that, but that you can live with the worst case scenario. Blake Mycoskie: That\u2019s what he proved, yeah. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re going to keep peeling back the onion here. I mentioned Stoicism earlier. Part of the reason I suspect Ben Franklin did that is he was a huge Seneca fan. Seneca, specifically, has a collection of letters called The Moral Letters to Lucilius. Don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t going to be long. Letter 13 called \u201cOn Festivals and Fasting.\u201d I know the name because I\u2019ve read it so many times. Part of it is set aside a few days \u2013 I\u2019m making up the time period \u2013 every month where you will go with the cheapest of dress, the scantiest of fare, the roughest of bed, asking yourself all the while, is this the condition I so feared? I have a close buddy, Kevin Kelly, who is amazing. Kevin Kelly is the founding editor of Wired magazine and has done a million of just incredible things. What he would say to himself to bring it into contemporary times, because he\u2019d spent a lot of time backpacking as a kid. \u201cI was always thrilled, even as just like a dirt bag college student backpacker to have sleeping bag and oatmeal. As long as I have a sleeping bag and oatmeal, I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t have to sell out.\u201d So this isn\u2019t selling out, this is dropping out. Blake Mycoskie: But I had started this thing and it was kind of working. I had employees and this responsibility. That felt much more real that going to class and talking about Descartes or whichever philosopher I was talking about at the time. I remember calling my Dad. I was really nervous because my Dad, as we\u2019ve talked about before, is this really accomplished doctor. He did how many years of school \u2013 college, medical school, residency. He made a life of education. I was going to tell him after 18 months that I was going to drop out of college. I was also the oldest grandchild of all my other cousins and stuff to. So I was the one everyone was looking at. His response to that was the most amazing. To this day, I\u2019m still kind of baffled to understand how his response was this way. He basically said, \u201cYou\u2019ve taken on this thing. You have a responsibility now to a lot of people and it seems like you\u2019re having a lot of fun. I think it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d I was like, is this a joke? I\u2019d been working on like a month on the preparation for this call. I was too scared to do it in person. Even though my parents only lived an hour away. I did this as a phone because if at any point I needed to hang up and get out of it, I could. He was totally supportive. I think it\u2019s a big testimony to my Dad and his belief of giving people the chance to fail and to learn. It was an amazing point because his confidence or his ability for me to be curious and try something. And also him stressing how I had really, now that I had employees, I had taken on more responsibility and just doing something for myself. It was bigger than just me. That has really stayed with me through all the different businesses. I think that\u2019s why we invest so much in our employees at Toms and their full wellbeing, not just in their financial wellbeing. Also the point my Dad and I made then too was I was going to be on my own financially. So if I dropped out, I was being supported by my parents when I was in college, as most, or a lot of kids, or not every kid has that fortune, but many of the kids in my school were. But he was like \u201cIf you\u2019re dropping out, your business needs to support you. You need to be able to support yourself.\u201d That was a real difficult reality at first too, which created a lot of fear. A lot of oh my gosh, now I have to make this work because my parents aren\u2019t supporting me anymore. But that also was great motivation. I think that was a great move on his part. Tim Ferriss: Got to keep your feet to the fire, right? No parental safety net. Blake Mycoskie: One of the things, a question I get all the time when I speak and universities now is they talk about people choosing to become entrepreneurs. I think, in my opinion, and a lot of people would disagree with me, you cannot choose to be an entrepreneur like you choose to be a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher. If you go into it saying okay, I\u2019m going to study entrepreneurship and my career path is becoming an entrepreneur, I think that is a recipe sometimes for disaster. What happens is if you\u2019ve chosen that path and you don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s bothering you, you don\u2019t have any itches you need to scratch, then all of a sudden you\u2019re looking at the world like how can I make money? How can I create something people want? But it\u2019s never really your want. It\u2019s never really your dying passion, your thing that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice everything to solve in the world. So you end up creating a business that is to make money and to do all these things they taught you in entrepreneurial textbooks, but it doesn\u2019t ever have that same intensity of the person that just is trying to solve a problem and then ends up creating a business. Tim Ferriss: As you point out too, this is super important. I\u2019ve spoken to classes as well about entrepreneurship. There are cases of people dropping out of college and becoming huge successes, right? But there are also a lot who do not. So it\u2019s not necessarily causation. Then you also have a lot of people who say go to a Harvard MBA program, then they do go on to become an entrepreneur and there are successful examples. But my position has always been exactly what you said. If I\u2019m at least scratching my own itch, I know for a fact there is one customer. I know for a fact there\u2019s one customer. So I did The 4-Hour Workweek, my first book. I went in to find the book that covered it and I couldn\u2019t find it. I was like, all right, there\u2019s Jack Welch over there, How to Build a Fortune 500 Company, not interested. Then there\u2019s like Money\u2019s Not Important \u2013 Give Away Everything. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in that camp either. Where\u2019s the thing in the middle? So it just ended up being a collection of those experiences for myself. Blake Mycoskie: Which, by the way, since you brought it up, I wanted to make sure I was at least able to say this. I read The 4-Hour Workweek right when I started Toms. There\u2019s so many things that I took from that book that allowed Toms to have this incredible growth. We never had investors, which is unheard of when you go from $0 to $500 million in seven years. The reason we were able to build so rapidly is we outsourced so many things. I never understood how you could operate so lean had I not read that book. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Blake Mycoskie: I think I\u2019d sent Tim many pictures over the years of me going like this with the No. 4. It\u2019s usually when I\u2019m sailing or playing polo or doing something fun. I\u2019m like, there\u2019s a lot of people that we\u2019ve outsourced a lot of this work to that are working really hard right now, but I\u2019m not and things are continuing to do great. I know that wasn\u2019t the only purpose of the book, but it really made an impact on me and a lot of our early staff all read it. Because when you\u2019re building a company, when you try to do everything yourself, it\u2019s really hard to grow as fast as you can. But the minute you let go of some of that control and you\u2019re outsourcing as many different things as you can, yeah, your margin might not be the same initially, but you can prove the model, you can get the top line sales, and then you can always come back and improve the margin later by bringing that stuff in house. But anyways, thank you. Tim Ferriss: Well, thank you. That makes my day. Blake Mycoskie: I think one of the negatives as starting as an entrepreneur at age 18 is you\u2019re so focused on your work, you have very little time for other stuff in your life. I was seeing that my friends were having much more fun social lives than me because I was working all the time. The way that I made a deal with myself was \u2013 and that was my way of still having some form of balance in my life. I think the word \u201cbalance,\u201d we could have a whole two-hour conversation about the concept of balance because I think people look at it in so many different ways. For me, the only way I could even have a thought of balance was this 11 months just going crazy, working as an entrepreneur and then that month off. My sister and I had been to all these amazing countries on The Amazing Race. One of the countries we quickly went through was Brazil and Argentina. I always liked really immersing myself in whatever that country was known for. So I got a guidebook and as you know very well, the first thing that came up and that Argentina is known for is the tango. I had not written a book yet, so I didn\u2019t know that it was possible to learn the tango at the level that you did. I was a little bit more \u2013 well, I just didn\u2019t have the rhythm or the dancing skills and frankly, I didn\u2019t want to spend my month off learning something that I probably thought I would never use again. So I decided not to do tango. Instead, I turned to horse polo. I grew up in Texas, had ridden horses before. Argentina is really well known for polo. I always thought it was a very romantic, cool, adrenaline sport. I signed up for polo camp at this place called La Tarde. I got there and after being there for a few days, I got bucked off a horse a bunch, almost was in the hospital the first week. It was dangerous, but it was a good danger. Every morning I woke up like, I\u2019m going to tackle this horse and I\u2019m going to hit this ball. I did that for a couple weeks. The other thing that Argentina is really well known for is their Malbec wines. If you like to drink red wine, Malbecs are fantastic. I decided to spend, when I wasn\u2019t playing polo, time in these different vineyards and wine cafes. In the wine cafes is when I ultimately met a few women that were doing some volunteer work, which ultimately led to the idea that there were all these kids that didn\u2019t have shoes. I\u2019m jumping a little forward in the story. But I chose Argentina ultimately because it was my way of taking a month off and recharging and learning something new, which was polo. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s jump right into it. You mentioned meeting these women. Blake Mycoskie: I\u2019d been in Argentina for about three weeks. Here you have Buenos Aires, which is an amazing city. There\u2019s some poverty and homeless and all the same things we have as problems here in our major cities in the United States. But you go an hour outside or two hours outside the city, where we were going a lot for the horses and fields to play polo. As I was seeing this because I was going to and from the city almost every day for the polo and for getting out to the farms, I think it was having an impression on me. But it wasn\u2019t something that was leading to an action. It was just like, gosh, this is really intense. This is really sad. I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s this much poverty just an hour from this great city. Almost everyone was speaking Spanish the whole time I was there. I was trying to learn it, but I was not doing a good job. I could kind of get around with the Spanish that I learned in three weeks, but it was getting exhausting. You\u2019re much better at learning languages and learning very quickly, as we know from reading your books. But for me, I had not been blessed with that ability yet. So I was just sitting at dinners most nights listening to everyone speak Spanish and it was like Charlie Brown\u2019s teachers, blah, blah, blah. I\u2019d be playing mental solitaire in my head until finally someone who could speak English would ask me a question. When I hear three women speaking English, I\u2019m just like a bee on honey. Whoa, what are you guys doing? It\u2019s so fun to talk to these women. They had been there for about the same amount of time as me. Two were from the U.S., one was from the U.K. They were going around to wealthy families in Buenos Aires collecting slightly used shoes and taking them to these towns and villages outside the city where kids needed shoes. It was amazing because I\u2019d just been for three weeks seeing kids in the streets, not in school clearly, and not wearing shoes. I was amazed by the fact that this was the limiting factor in their education. But also believed it because I had seen all these kids on the streets. I\u2019m a very curious person. I\u2019d been playing polo for three weeks. I was looking for something more to round out my month experience. I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this, but can I come and help in some way? If you\u2019re going to be distributing all these shoes in the next week, can you use another set of hands?\u201d They said, \u201cAbsolutely, we\u2019d love for you to come.\u201d When we got there, the kids had been told that they were going to get shoes this day. There was already this incredible excitement in the air. When we pulled in, the kids and some of the parents just started appearing from all these nooks and crannies in this town that was right next to a garbage dump. Exactly what you can picture if you\u2019ve seen Slumdog Millionaire. That\u2019s exactly what it felt like. But there was an incredible and enthusiasm because they\u2019re getting these shoes. It was hard because the kids, a lot of them, most of them, didn\u2019t even know what size they were because all they had was a pair of flip-flops and they didn\u2019t have a proper shoe. Trying to get them fitted, that was a challenge, but we worked through it. After all the kids had shoes, we played soccer. We just had a great day. He was like, that\u2019s pretty cool. He was actually kind of \u2013 first he thought it was cool that anyone was doing this for these kids because he knew the area. But second, he thought it was a nice gesture. I was telling him about how awesome it was and how exciting and how much fun. He was listening really intently. At this time, Alejo, a young guy, he\u2019s 23 years old, a great polo player and he\u2019s listening. He got so excited. It was actually his enthusiasm, the reason I\u2019m pretty much sitting here. Because he was like, \u201cThis is an amazing idea. We have to do this.\u201d Tim Ferriss: So just to put it in perspective too, the Argentines, especially the Porte\u00f1os, right? Who live in Capital Federal in Buenos Aires, they\u2019re a mixture of all sorts of immigrant bloods. They\u2019ve got a lot of Italian, which is where they get the [inaudible]. Blake Mycoskie: Yeah, a lot of Italian. Tim Ferriss: And they\u2019ve got a little bit of German and then all sorts of other bits and pieces. Yes, a very enthusiastic bunch. Blake Mycoskie: Yes, so Alejo, professional polo player, 23 years old, doesn\u2019t know a thing about shoes, tells me \u2013 at first it\u2019s not we. It\u2019s YOU have to do this. It\u2019s your idea, you do it. He was like, \u201cBut I will help you. I will figure this out.\u201d So literally, by lunch \u2013 this is a guy who has two cellphones, not because he has a work phone and a personal phone, but because he has two conversations going on at all times. He\u2019s talking to so-and-so\u2019s brother and his his cousin and someone in the \u2013 and it\u2019s all in Spanish, so I don\u2019t understand anything he\u2019s saying, but it\u2019s with enthusiasm. He\u2019s like, this is what\u2019s happening. So by lunch, he had already figured out someone, a friend of a friend, who made alpargatas in their garage an hour away. Before I could even say no, we\u2019re going. We are in this. I\u2019m supposed to leave in like four days. In that long car ride there and back, as we really talked about it, my entrepreneur brain started thinking. I think this could work. Because first off, I\u2019ve been wearing this alpargata. I love it. It\u2019s super lightweight, super comfortable. If it gets wet, it dries right away. There\u2019s nothing like this. The only shoes that are in this canvas slip-on are Converse or Vans and they\u2019re heavier and they\u2019re clunkier. I\u2019ve worn those all these years, but this is different. I started to really fall in love with the product as well as the idea. Then I recognized that this didn\u2019t have \u2013 it was the first time I had an idea in my life that I didn\u2019t think of as a business really. Even though I was structuring it as we\u2019re going to sell something and give something and it\u2019s going to be a business and not a charity, I didn\u2019t think I needed to do this to make money. I\u2019d made some money. The driver\u2019s ed business was going great. Sales were skyrocketing. I\u2019m a little bit less interested in starting a business to make money. But I\u2019m really thinking this could be fun. That\u2019s the thing I always try to make sure that people really understand in terms of the beginning motivation. I was connected to these kids and I think this could work and help them and it was going to be a ton of fun. Now I was going to get to go back to Argentina four times a year. This was a great excuse to go to this country that I\u2019ve fallen in love with. Alejo is so fun and other people were. Long story short, we get to this guy and we\u2019re telling him, no, we don\u2019t want alpargatas. We want to have a nice insole and arch support and they\u2019re going to make the shoe cost like five times as much money. He\u2019s like, \u201cNo one will ever buy this. Too expensive.\u201d I\u2019m like no, it\u2019s got to last long because these things wear out in a couple weeks. Just things, even though I\u2019d had no experience in shoes, as a customer, I would want this shoe to look this way, but I\u2019d want it to perform a different way. After a couple days of going back and forth. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve now called my partners at the driver\u2019s ed business and told them it\u2019s not going to be a one-month vacation, but two months this year. I\u2019m going to take another couple weeks to see if I can figure out this shoe thing. I hadn\u2019t told any of my friends of what I was thinking of doing or anyone. I just started calling my sister and girlfriends and friends of mine that I thought would appreciate this shoe and not telling them the story initially. That was one of the key points. Tim Ferriss: So selling the product on the product\u2019s merits? Blake Mycoskie: I knew that the story would get people excited, but I didn\u2019t want to really go into making this a venture unless I felt the product could stand on its own. Plus, I also didn\u2019t know how much to charge. I needed to get people\u2019s reaction. Do you like it, No. 1. No. 2, how much would you pay for it? It was such a different shoe than anything else out there. I spent a week or two really doing that. Tim Ferriss: Can I ask a question? You seem to have a long history of doing market research by asking women. We didn\u2019t even cover the \u2013 Blake Mycoskie: Yes. Don\u2019t they buy most of the stuff? Tim Ferriss: We didn\u2019t even cover the Theta sorority collaboration with EZ Laundry. That\u2019s a whole separate episode. Did you ask primarily women about \u2013 Blake Mycoskie: I did. Even though I didn\u2019t think it was \u2013 I thought men and women would buy the shoes, but I just felt like I didn\u2019t know very much about shoes in my life at that point. I knew nothing. But what I did know is that every woman in my life spent a lot of money and time on shoes. Whether it was my Mom, my sister, my girlfriend, there were buying shoes. I never really saw my guy friends buying shoes. Obviously, they had to because they wore shoes, but it wasn\u2019t like they talked about it. I figured let\u2019s go where \u2013 this conversation is already happening, let\u2019s just enter into the conversation. That\u2019s why initially my quick market research was women. But it was so cool because I remember this time I had several girls over to the house or the apartment at the time in Venice. They thought they were coming over for this dinner party that I was going to arrange, but instead I had all these shoes on the table. They were like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have dinner, but before I want to show you \u2013 Tim Ferriss: To earn your dinner. Blake Mycoskie: Yeah, to earn your dinner, there is no free dinner. Is I want to hear what you think about these shoes, because I\u2019m thinking of selling them. They come from Argentina. I didn\u2019t tell them about the story. As I saw them in my living room, trying them on and getting pretty positive feedback of they\u2019re cute, they\u2019re comfortable, I\u2019d wear them with this. They were talking amongst themselves. Then I pulled out a bunch of photos from my trip in this village and I told them the story. At this point, I\u2019ve never seen women so excited to buy a pair of shoes. They bought three pairs each. They were telling me, \u201cI\u2019m going to call my friend. She\u2019s got to get a pair.\u201d It was like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Feeding frenzy. Blake Mycoskie: Feeding frenzy. It was because of the story. It was because of the idea of one-for-one. It was because up until that point, they had never been offered an opportunity to buy something for themselves that they usually feel guilty about. Because women buying shoes doesn\u2019t always end in happiness. A lot of it\u2019s guilt because they have too many already. This time, they had no guilt. It was like the guilt-free shopping of the century. They were buying multiple pairs. They were telling me other girlfriends of theirs they would get to buy them. Some of the girls worked in PR and were telling me what stores to be in. Immediately I was like wow, I hit a nerve. That was really encouraging. That\u2019s what got the initial sales going and helped me figure out how much to charge for them. The interesting thing about the charging \u2013 this is I think at some level why in the dictionary under the word \u201ckarma\u201d there should be a picture of Toms. We created a model that was basically to break even, not to make money. So our whole goal was to get as many kids as shoes as possible. We wanted to charge a price that would be the least amount that we could charge a customer and still be able to pay for another pair of shoes and have an organization. So even though we weren\u2019t a non-profit, we went into this thinking that profit is not the motivation. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re maximizing your margin. Blake Mycoskie: Yes. The thing is, we were making all the shoes by hand in garages in Argentina, which turns out is very expensive. We\u2019re making shoes. When Toms started to take off and all of a sudden we were selling not a hundred pairs here and there, but thousands, tens of thousands and then millions, we started large-scale manufacturing. Our costs went from here to here. All of a sudden, we had this hugely profitable business. It\u2019s like, how did we get here? All we did was truly \u2013 I\u2019ll never forget. Tim Ferriss: The accidental profitable organization. Blake Mycoskie: It really was this crazy moment when I met with this factory for the first time, when we were moving from garages to factory. I was like, how much per pair? He gave me a price and I\u2019m like is that per shoe or per pair? It was crazy how much less it was. Then we realized, okay, we can do the giving, we can do that. And we can have a good business. And we can make money. That was the ah-ha moment of this is what I\u2019m going to put all my energy behind. Tim Ferriss: So in the very beginning, what names did you consider for the company and how did it end up on Toms? Blake Mycoskie: That\u2019s a great question. Tim Ferriss: How many people think your name is Tom? Blake Mycoskie: Most people think my name is Tom. That\u2019s the No. 1 question. You know that Tim\u2019s a great interviewer because it\u2019s been an hour and 45 minutes until he\u2019s asked me that question. Nine times out of ten, that\u2019s the leading first question because it\u2019s so obvious. So the name Toms. I wore this shoe today in particular because (a) it\u2019s one of my favorite shoes we\u2019ve ever made and it\u2019s also one of the first shoes we ever made ten years ago. What happened was is I originally called them Tomorrow Shoes. The reason they were called Tomorrow Shoes is that we thought we could make a better tomorrow by selling a pair today and giving a pair tomorrow. So that was our pitch. If you buy a pair today, we promise you that we will give a pair tomorrow to a child in need. Thank you. For the first couple weeks, they were called Tomorrow Shoes. We\u2019re down in Argentina, we\u2019re making them. Then we start looking at all the other casual shoes in the market. Now we\u2019re starting to think about this a little bit more. We\u2019ve got to figure out how we\u2019re going to brand this thing. So we\u2019re looking at this shoe and in this shoe in particular, there\u2019s not a lot of places to brand it. The most natural place would be on the back. There\u2019s no way I could fit the word \u201cTomorrows\u201d on the back of this shoe. It just wouldn\u2019t fit, no matter how little the font got. So I said okay, we\u2019ll call it Toms \u2013 Shoes for a Better Tomorrow. So Toms coming from the word tomorrow. We chose the Argentine flag because that\u2019s where they were being made. We got rid of the sun and put the Toms in there. That\u2019s how it started and that\u2019s how the name came. It\u2019s funny because literally still to this day people call me Tom. Especially in the beginning. Before anyone knew what I looked like and they assumed that there was this Tom. One of my favorite stories is in order to sell the shoes, it\u2019s like anything else entrepreneurial. The story is as important as the product. You\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019ve got a good product, but you\u2019ve got to convey your enthusiasm. And so when I first got into Nordstrom, which was pretty early considering how small a business we were. They said we\u2019ll sell your shoes in these stores in Southern California, but you have to commit to going every Saturday and literally sitting there next to them and telling the story. Because the story was what was so interesting. So I said, \u201cFine, okay.\u201d So I would go. I\u2019ll never forget this one manager. I got there on a Saturday morning, bright and early. I\u2019m all excited. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m Blake. I\u2019m here to sell the Toms Shoes.\u201d She\u2019s looked at me and she goes, \u201cOh, man. We have a problem.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d She says, \u201cWe\u2019ve been advertising for like a week that Tom is coming.\u201d I was like, \u201cI am Tom.\u201d I used to carry my laptop [inaudible] quickly have it up. \u201cThat\u2019s who you think Tom is. Look, that\u2019s me. We\u2019re the same person.\u201d Tim Ferriss: The times that we live in right now, it\u2019s very romanticized to go out and raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture financing with something very complicated. The businesses that have worked for you that we\u2019ve talked about started addressing a frustration or a need of your own, simple and low capital requirements. At least in the very beginning. Blake Mycoskie: The only business I ever raised money for was the business that failed, and that was the reality channel. That was the thing about Toms was we never raised money because we started small \u2013 250 pairs. Then it was 1,000 pairs. Then it was 2,000 pairs. As we started growing, we were able to get bank loans and things like that to finance inventory. That\u2019s one of the things that I think allowed us to preserve who we are today, ten years later with 75 million shoes given and all these things happened because we didn\u2019t have that influence that comes from investors and their demands and how fast you\u2019ve got to grow and things you\u2019ve got to do. I always say to entrepreneurs, there\u2019s some businesses inherently you have to raise money for. If you have a good idea and you can execute, every day that you wait, your idea and your company becomes more valuable. Tim Ferriss: And the more leverage you have. Blake Mycoskie: And the more leverage you have. The first time I saw someone wearing Toms was like a really special moment. It\u2019s kind of like an artist that first times sees their painting hanging in a gallery. Anyone who\u2019s created something of any magnitude is proud when they see it, especially if they see it on someone that\u2019s a stranger that bought it without you begging them on the floor of Nordstrom, right? About four or five months after we started Toms, and this was before we were even in Nordstrom. We were only selling them online. The only people I\u2019d seen wearing them were my neighbors because all of our neighbors in the neighborhood thought that it was cool that we were running this shoe company out of the apartment in Venice. So they were buying them; my interns; and then my family, of course. I was in New York City and I had actually had a very bad week. I had gone trying to get new customers, like retailers like the American Rag. I had just struck out. New Yorkers wanted nothing to do with this shoe. I was going back to L.A. a little bit with my tail between my legs. I wasn\u2019t even wearing Toms. I was wearing some running shoes or something because I\u2019d gone for a run in the park earlier that morning and then I was rushing to the airport. I get to the American Airlines check-in counter. I\u2019m doing the kiosk. I\u2019m not checking bags, just doing it quickly. I look to my right and there\u2019s this woman and she\u2019s wearing a red pairs of Toms. Mid-30s, wearing a pair of jeans, a pair of red Toms and I\u2019m super excited. But at the same time, I\u2019ll really curious. Like where\u2019d you get those? What do you think about them? My marketing head, my focus group head just goes straight to it. So I say \u201cExcuse me. I couldn\u2019t help but notice these red shoes you\u2019re wearing. They\u2019re really cool. What are they?\u201d I\u2019m still doing the check-in because I don\u2019t want to act like I\u2019m too interested right and giving it away. She looks at me and her eyes kind of widen, and she goes \u201cThey\u2019re Toms. Toms Shoes.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cool. That\u2019s great.\u201d I\u2019m kind of just taking, waiting to see what she says. I could tell, she\u2019s looking at me like no, I have more to tell. So I kind of turned to her and she looks at me like really intently. She goes, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you understand. This is the most amazing company in the world. When I bought this pair of shoes, they gave a pair for a child in Argentina.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, really?\u201d She continued, \u201cThere\u2019s this guy. He lives in Los Angeles. I think he lives on a boat.\u201d She literally starts telling me my life story. Word for word. Like with more passion than my Mom tells it. It was incredible. She\u2019s going on and on about this and that. At some point, I was like, oh gosh, I have to tell her who I am now. There\u2019s other people listening. She\u2019s animated. I say to her, \u201cExcuse me. Actually, sorry to interrupt. But I\u2019m Blake. I started Toms.\u201d She just pauses. It\u2019s like deer in headlights. You could hear a pin drop. She looks at me. She looks at me again. She goes, \u201cWhy did you cut your hair?\u201d But the interesting thing about that question and what I learned a huge business lesson in this question. The reason she knew I cut my hair is she had watched every video on YouTube about our shoe giving. This is 2006, same year YouTube launched. Because there wasn\u2019t a lot of content on there, our videos got a lot of views back then. She\u2019d watched it and seen it. I realized she wasn\u2019t just a customer. She took the time out of her check-in to tell me the entire story. She was an evangelist for Toms. So much that she didn\u2019t recognize me because I had cut my hair short like this. Before in the videos, it was really long and bushy. It was so funny because on the way home, I realized we didn\u2019t need to focus on marketing and advertising. That\u2019s not what got this girl to buy a pair of shoes. We need to focus on doing our giving and making sure that content was easily sharable with our customers. Because if she was this passionate to tell a stranger at the airport, surely she had posted on Facebook about it, Tweeted about it, probably bought a pair for her friend for Christmas or whatever. So it was an amazing experience for me. It really has dictated our whole philosophy on marketing for the past ten years. If we do what we say we\u2019re going to do and we create interesting content that allows our customers to share with pride what they\u2019ve done, because it\u2019s really them. We set it up, but unless we sell shoes, we don\u2019t give them away. It\u2019s what they\u2019ve done. Then the momentum can build. I think that\u2019s why we had this exponential growth. Tim Ferriss: This is a related one. This is actually from the extended family known as the internet. This is not like the drunk, angry uncle though. This is the nicer member of that Christmas party. So Daniel Roddick, I think that\u2019s his name \u2013 I\u2019m going to shorten this a little bit. \u201cThere\u2019s a term I\u2019ve heard used before called WFIO.\u201d Which is pronounced whif-ee-oh, which stands for \u201cWe\u2019re fucked; it\u2019s over.\u201d Essentially it\u2019s when your business seems it\u2019s on the brink of failure. You\u2019re running out of cash. PR crisis [inaudible] etc. The question \u2013 and it goes on. This is a long question. But I was just wondering if you had any particular examples. Blake Mycoskie: WFIOs. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, from Toms. If there were any sort of existential threats when you\u2019re like oh, boy. Blake Mycoskie: There\u2019s one that\u2019s as clear as day. This is in the second year. We now have made that transition from making them in garages to a big factory, knowing nothing about how to negotiate with factories and factories can smell naivete a mile away. We totally got screwed over by a factory. We had taken all these big orders. We had taken all the cash that we had. Not just Toms, but like me personally, out of my personal checking account, to order all these shoes, knowing that we were going to sell them for a profit and then we would be able \u2013 so it was a cash flow thing. I\u2019ll never forget. I was with my Dad and it was the day that I was getting the sailboat that I was going to live on. I lived on a sailboat for six years. It\u2019s a whole other story about essentialism and not having stuff you don\u2019t need in life and simplifying your life, which I was very intent on doing after spending so much time in Argentina. So I\u2019m going to get the boat with my Dad. It\u2019s supposed to be a great day in my life. I get a call. It\u2019s Sean, actually. The guy you saw. He\u2019s like, \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cEvery single sole on the shoes are falling off.\u201d They\u2019re not like not good quality, like they\u2019re falling off. Like the glue they used at the factory got hot on the way here, whatever. He\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s disintegrating.\u201d All these people were expecting their shoes and all your money is in this. We didn\u2019t have money to order more shoes. It was definitely a WFIO moment if there ever was one. I really did think it was going to be over. One, we were going to call these people and say we weren\u2019t able to deliver and it would take weeks, if not months, to get them. This is at the point where we now have big customers, like Urban Outfitters and Nordstrom\u2019s. They don\u2019t take this news lightly. The second was, all our cash was in there. There was no more cash to order more shoes. Ultimately, the way we saved it was we were able to convince another factory that if they would make the shoes without any initial payment, that we would be able to pay them within 90 days and we would switch all of our business to them. They did and they were a great factory for a long time. But I didn\u2019t even know that was a possibility. That came after days of heavy drinking and putting myself in a hole in which I couldn\u2019t come out. I think every business has that. Ultimately, if you get through it, it makes you stronger. But the truth is, it probably kills a lot of businesses too. Tim Ferriss: In retrospect, were there any warning signs or anything that you could have \u2013 are there ways that you could have avoided that? Blake Mycoskie: In that particular case, I don\u2019t think so. We didn\u2019t have the brand reputation or the cash flow to have any leverage over factories, but we needed factories. At the same time, we didn\u2019t have the experience level to know how to protect ourselves from that. In hindsight, there\u2019s lots of things you can do to protect yourself from factories and payment terms and all these things. I think it was just a situation where we were unlucky and the factory took advantage of us. They probably thought they would never get another order anyway, so they didn\u2019t take it too seriously. Tim Ferriss: If you were advising somebody \u2013 and I know this is going to be a small percentage of the audience \u2013 but actually in growing percentage, you now have people launching businesses on Kickstarter. It\u2019s like good news/bad news. We\u2019ve never made anything but we have 5,000 orders. We\u2019ve told a really good story. What advice would you tell someone who\u2019s looking at manufacturing for the first time? Blake Mycoskie: I would say the best thing to do in manufacturing for the first time, is have the manufacturing as close to you physically as you can, even if it\u2019s a huge difference in margin, difference in price. Because what you\u2019re trying to do in the beginning is prove a model. You\u2019re not trying necessarily to make money. If it costs 80 percent more to do it in your home town than doing it overseas, I would say do it in your home town where you can watch it, be there, touch \u2013 then you don\u2019t have the surprises. The thing that kills you with manufacturing, especially from a far-off place, is the surprise when it comes not being what you thought it was. By that time, it\u2019s too late. So the nice things is \u2013 or you just move to wherever you\u2019re manufacturing. One of my favorite entrepreneurs are Fernando and Santiago who started Reef sandals. These are Argentines actually as well, that I got to know through the years being in the shoe business. Santiago moved to Brazil and lived at the factory for those early years of Reef to literally watch every shoe being made. That\u2019s why their quality was so good and that\u2019s why they built such a great company. So sometimes if you can\u2019t make it locally, you go there. But manufacturing is where I would say most of these businesses never get off the ground or end up imploding just because it\u2019s one strike and you\u2019re out, typically. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a case where you really have to have boots on the ground. I was talking to a buddy of mine who is the founder or co-founder of an apparel brand called Sitka. It\u2019s if you want to think of the Lululemon for hunting and outdoor gear. Really high-quality stuff. He went to China for the same reason. This is a guy \u2013 I\u2019ve had some drinks with him. The way that he negotiated his terms that he needed, because they were like, yeah, can\u2019t be done. No, everything\u2019s got to be light. Similar to [inaudible]. Like ohmygod, this is an existential crisis. So he went to China and he sat there. He needed a translator. They were doing Cheers! Cheers to this. Cheers to the Chairman. Cheers to that. He was like, \u201cDo they have to drink every time I do a cheers?\u201d The translator was like \u201cYes, it would be rude not to.\u201d He was like, okay. And so he just got everybody completely blitzed. And then the big boss was like, \u201cDefinitely! Next week! No problem!\u201d And so he got his gear on time. Anyway, not my recommended negotiating tactic necessarily. There are books and so on you could read. Blake Mycoskie: If I lost the material positions or the wealth or the ability to do some of the things that my family used to do, it kind of goes back to what Tim was saying the guy with the sleeping bag and the oatmeal. Like I feel like there\u2019s enough people that would help me get that oatmeal and that backpack and that sleeping bag and me and my family would still live a great life. The thing that I\u2019ve learned the most \u2013 I think it\u2019s the most \u2013 from my travels around the world \u2013 and I\u2019ve been to every country and seen almost every hardship that is imaginable, is sometimes the people who are living in the most poverty, the most rural, are also the happiest. The reason is because their life is so simple that they spend their time in relationships. Like it\u2019s amazing to see \u2013 I\u2019m very close with many families in Ethiopia. We spend a lot of time there. We do manufacturing there. When you get to rural Ethiopia, you see the amount of time that they just spend in laughter and games and playing. It\u2019s because there\u2019s not much else to do because they don\u2019t have anything else. Basically, their only daily chores is making sure they have water and food. Other than that, it\u2019s just all about relationship and loving on one another. I think it\u2019s a tricky time we live in now. We get caught in the cycle of having to support these lifestyles that we create and oftentimes we spend so much money trying to do that, that we don\u2019t end up enjoying the life that we have. I will say that\u2019s one thing that in my maturing and learning and studying over the years, I have gotten much better at and put much more premium on. I don\u2019t work 11 months, lights out, and then just for that one month off anymore. I make sure I am experiencing \u2013 I mean, yesterday, Tim texted me to have a pre-call and I was surfing all day in Santa Barbara. I didn\u2019t have my phone on. I didn\u2019t get back to him until 10:00 at night because I was like, you know what? I had a couple really long days before this. I want to have a lot of fresh energy for this today, so I took the whole day and went surfing with one of my best friends and spent time all morning with my son. Those are the things that are important. I didn\u2019t always realize that. I think that you really can\u2019t lose everything when what you care about are the people and the memories you have.

isn\u2019t a part-time job", "it\u2019s that good of a restaurant job", "but luckily, the hiring manager was a huge tennis fan", "we talked about tennis", "she played in college at a rival school than i was playing at and all this", "i was like, i can do this job", "i really had to sell her on me doing it", "so i got the job", "i came home and i said to my dad, \u201ci got a job.\u201d not only a job, but a job that i\u2019m going to make a lot of money this summer", "the next part if you work in a restaurant is memorizing the menu", "i had memorizing things", "that is the worst for me", "studying and cramming for tests is not my thing", "after two or three days of this, i was like, this is miserable", "i\u2019m not going to be able to memorize this menu", "and i found out that you don\u2019t even get paid the first two weeks because it\u2019s training", "my summer is only like nine weeks long", "i\u2019m like, that\u2019s 15 percent that i\u2019m not getting paid", "so this is sounding less and less appealing every day", "this is where the moment came, i think this was when my truly first entrepreneurial synapses went off in my brain", "next to our house, there was a tennis court", "i clearly learned to become a great tennis player", "i knew there were a lot of kids in our neighborhood that could use tennis lessons", "maybe even some other adults who wanted tennis lessons", "we had this tennis court we could use any time", "i knew how much my parents paid for tennis lessons for me growing up", "it was a huge investment for me", "i said before i got into work this weekend, i made these flyers", "i put smu college tennis player training for next eight weeks \u2013 kids, adults, classes, the whole thing", "the same way as you\u2019d see at a country club", "i made 5,000 flyers", "i put them \u2013 it literally took me two days \u2013 in every single mailbox in the entire neighborhood", "at that point, i had my own phone line", "i changed my voicemail to like blake\u2019s tennis camp or something", "i started getting calls", "within a week, i had every hour of the day booked", "instead of making \u2013 i think at pappadeaux with tips and stuff, i had averaged where i was going to be making like $14.00 or $15.00 an hour, which would\u2019ve been really good back then", "teaching tennis, because i had each kid paying $15.00 an hour and i had five kids at a time, i was making like $80.00 an hour", "i had this set up", "my dad came home, he thought i was supposed to be at work at pappadeaux", "he sees me teaching a whole group of kids and my mom delivering cookies and lemonade to their parents, and he does, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d i said, \u201cthis is still a job and i\u2019m making four times the money that i was.\u201d so that was the moment where i started my entrepreneurial journey", "did your dad want you to get a job to earn money or was it because he wanted you to have the experience of reporting to someone else and all that", "clearly it was the latter, but i trumped him with earning \u2013 he couldn\u2019t argue with an 18-year-old making $80.00 an hour", "it was crazy", "every time i\u2019m on a airplane, the first thing i do, if it\u2019s not getting a cup of coffee, is start journaling", "i have a massive safe in my office that has hundreds and hundreds of journals", "we\u2019re actually making a documentary film about the whole toms experience", "a big part of the film is going back and just grabbing random journals and reading these entries", "you\u2019re like, i can\u2019t believe i was saying this or thinking this", "because you tend \u2013 or i tended to be \u2013 even though i confess all my fears, i tended to use the journal as a way of positively setting the tone for the next day, the next week, the next month", "it\u2019s something that i love doing and it\u2019s something i\u2019m really glad i did", "i think it helps me understand my life, which i think is good, because understanding your past is how you can really be more proactive for your future", "so this is a shared habit", "i have probably about eight bookshelves worth of journals", "i\u2019ve kept them all since around the same age, 15, 16", "but it started with weightlifting \u2013 same thing", "i wanted to track my progress and to be able to understand what worked and what didn\u2019t and so on", "it\u2019s turned into what i\u2019ve heard described, i think her name is julia cameron \u2013 she wrote a book called the artist\u2019s way", "she described journaling, the first type, the confessional, as spiritual windshield wipers", "meaning you get that down, especially in the morning \u2013 and the way i look at it is sort of trapping my monkey mind and my anxieties on the page so that i can get on with the day", "the morning journaling habit was actually introduced to me by \u2013 by the way guys, the morning journaling specifically isn\u2019t something i started until about three years ago", "i think as a lot of people, i had been journaling for a long time and then i stopped for a while", "i would only use it for goal setting", "but i didn\u2019t do that other part, which i think is so critical", "i was like, that\u2019s like the rah-rah positive thinking", "i don\u2019t want to even get involved, the secret, whatever", "i don\u2019t want to deal with it", "i then ran into a guy named brian koppelman, who\u2019s a screenwriter", "along with his partner, they did the illusionist, a solitary man, ocean\u2019s thirteen, billions (the co-creators of that show, which is a current huge hit)", "he does it every morning", "he said, \u201cyou have to start morning journaling.\u201d since it was coming from him, i started and it was immediate the difference in not just my performance, but also my wellbeing", "i think, and i haven\u2019t heard the spiritual windshield wiper, which i like, that term, is that\u2019s what it kind of does for me", "anything that is controlling my thoughts, stress-related or i feel like i have too many things on my mind or my to-do list or everything", "once i get it on the page, then i can just singularly focus on the most important things of the day", "i know you\u2019ve spoken about do the two most important things right away in your day and by journaling, (a) it helps me organize what are those really important things", "because when you\u2019re writing about it, whatever\u2019s getting the most attention typically is the thing you don\u2019t want to have to do but you need to do", "but it really does, i think, help you clean your day", "and then at the end of the day too, i think it also can serve as a way to allow yourself to relax and get ready for bed and get over with the day if you\u2019ve had some stuff on your mind", "it\u2019s interesting by writing it, you think you make it even more something you\u2019d be thinking about, but i find once i\u2019ve written it and i let it go and i close the book, the problems are in the book and they\u2019re no longer with me anymore", "if it\u2019s a positive thing, but i think it\u2019s just potentially reinforcing that", "i\u2019ll never forget this", "it\u2019s so interesting how going back to these little moments in your life that can really change your trajectory and oftentimes it can be someone that you meet or you listen to or a book you read", "there is a guy named bob dedman", "bob dedman has passed now", "he was a self-made billionaire and he gave more money to smu and university of texas than anyone ever", "he literally grew up in a trailer park", "he started off as a lawyer and then ultimately where he made his real fortune was he recognized that country clubs were becoming more and more popular in the \u201870s and the \u201880s", "but it was very expensive to maintain the golf course and the restaurant and everything", "you made money by selling the real estate around it", "what he started doing was creating clubs with multiple courses but one crew that could service multiple courses", "so now you only need one greens keeper for three clubs and three times the amount of real estate sales, one kitchen, all these things", "it became this thing called clubcorp", "when he passed away, he was the largest owner of golf courses and tennis courts in the world", "he this amazing guy", "he lived in dallas, texas", "he loved tennis", "so he\u2019d come out and watch our tennis matches", "he was an eccentric billionaire guy who\u2019d watch our tennis matches", "for whatever reason, i forget what it was \u2013 i think it was raining and we couldn\u2019t practice that day", "our coach said, \u201cyou guys have seen mr", "dedman many times watching the matches", "since it\u2019s raining today, we can\u2019t practice", "we\u2019re going to watch a video of a commencement speech that he gave for the mba program at the university of texas a couple weeks ago", "just so you can have some more frame of reference of how wise this guy is.\u201d the speech was basically about having a life path and thinking of your life as a stool", "every stool has three or four legs", "what are going to be the legs of your life", "what\u2019s going to be your path", "one is your talents", "one is your interests", "all these different things", "i can\u2019t remember exactly what it was", "i remember leaving that day and i just heard myself thinking, \u201ci don\u2019t think my stool is going to be a professional tennis player", "i actually think my life is about other things.\u201d i started recognizing these talents", "definitely self-discipline and all these different things", "i remember watching that video and having peace at the idea of not continuing down this tennis path", "another great ben franklin story that i\u2019ve read that actually had a huge impact on early days at toms \u2013 i was reading a biography, one of the many written", "when he had the farmers\u2019 almanac", "a lot of people don\u2019t recognize that was how he made his first fortune was through the almanac", "most of the things we know ben franklin for actually happened after he retired at age 40", "he sold the farmers\u2019 almanac, had money at the time, retired", "and then all his inventions then came out of the curiosities afterwards", "one of my favorite stories was there was this person that would advertise in the farmers\u2019 almanac", "ben franklin did not agree with this ethics and his morals and his ideals, but he needed to take advertising money to keep his almanac going", "so what he decided to do was that night, instead of sleeping in his bed in his home, he slept at his office on the floor with only a piece of bread to eat", "he woke up the next morning and he was just as happy as he was the day before", "that\u2019s when he said he would never take advertising dollars from someone he didn\u2019t believe in", "that was a huge thing with me early with toms", "we will stay 100 percent focused on the mission, whether we make it or not because we\u2019re going to be happier doing it the way we feel is the right thing to do than cutting corners to make extra money", "when i read that, that was a huge thing", "i was just going to say, not only that, but that you can live with the worst case scenario", "that\u2019s what he proved, yeah", "we\u2019re going to keep peeling back the onion here", "i mentioned stoicism earlier", "part of the reason i suspect ben franklin did that is he was a huge seneca fan", "seneca, specifically, has a collection of letters called the moral letters to lucilius", "don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t going to be long", "letter 13 called \u201con festivals and fasting.\u201d i know the name because i\u2019ve read it so many times", "part of it is set aside a few days \u2013 i\u2019m making up the time period \u2013 every month where you will go with the cheapest of dress, the scantiest of fare, the roughest of bed, asking yourself all the while, is this the condition i so feared", "i have a close buddy, kevin kelly, who is amazing", "kevin kelly is the founding editor of wired magazine and has done a million of just incredible things", "what he would say to himself to bring it into contemporary times, because he\u2019d spent a lot of time backpacking as a kid", "\u201ci was always thrilled, even as just like a dirt bag college student backpacker to have sleeping bag and oatmeal", "as long as i have a sleeping bag and oatmeal, i\u2019m fine", "i don\u2019t have to sell out.\u201d so this isn\u2019t selling out, this is dropping out", "but i had started this thing and it was kind of working", "i had employees and this responsibility", "that felt much more real that going to class and talking about descartes or whichever philosopher i was talking about at the time", "i remember calling my dad", "i was really nervous because my dad, as we\u2019ve talked about before, is this really accomplished doctor", "he did how many years of school \u2013 college, medical school, residency", "he made a life of education", "i was going to tell him after 18 months that i was going to drop out of college", "i was also the oldest grandchild of all my other cousins and stuff to", "so i was the one everyone was looking at", "his response to that was the most amazing", "to this day, i\u2019m still kind of baffled to understand how his response was this way", "he basically said, \u201cyou\u2019ve taken on this thing", "you have a responsibility now to a lot of people and it seems like you\u2019re having a lot of fun", "i think it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d i was like, is this a joke", "i\u2019d been working on like a month on the preparation for this call", "i was too scared to do it in person", "even though my parents only lived an hour away", "i did this as a phone because if at any point i needed to hang up and get out of it, i could", "he was totally supportive", "i think it\u2019s a big testimony to my dad and his belief of giving people the chance to fail and to learn", "it was an amazing point because his confidence or his ability for me to be curious and try something", "and also him stressing how i had really, now that i had employees, i had taken on more responsibility and just doing something for myself", "it was bigger than just me", "that has really stayed with me through all the different businesses", "i think that\u2019s why we invest so much in our employees at toms and their full wellbeing, not just in their financial wellbeing", "also the point my dad and i made then too was i was going to be on my own financially", "so if i dropped out, i was being supported by my parents when i was in college, as most, or a lot of kids, or not every kid has that fortune, but many of the kids in my school were", "but he was like \u201cif you\u2019re dropping out, your business needs to support you", "you need to be able to support yourself.\u201d that was a real difficult reality at first too, which created a lot of fear", "a lot of oh my gosh, now i have to make this work because my parents aren\u2019t supporting me anymore", "but that also was great motivation", "i think that was a great move on his part", "got to keep your feet to the fire, right", "no parental safety net", "one of the things, a question i get all the time when i speak and universities now is they talk about people choosing to become entrepreneurs", "i think, in my opinion, and a lot of people would disagree with me, you cannot choose to be an entrepreneur like you choose to be a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher", "if you go into it saying okay, i\u2019m going to study entrepreneurship and my career path is becoming an entrepreneur, i think that is a recipe sometimes for disaster", "what happens is if you\u2019ve chosen that path and you don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s bothering you, you don\u2019t have any itches you need to scratch, then all of a sudden you\u2019re looking at the world like how can i make money", "how can i create something people want", "but it\u2019s never really your want", "it\u2019s never really your dying passion, your thing that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice everything to solve in the world", "so you end up creating a business that is to make money and to do all these things they taught you in entrepreneurial textbooks, but it doesn\u2019t ever have that same intensity of the person that just is trying to solve a problem and then ends up creating a business", "as you point out too, this is super important", "i\u2019ve spoken to classes as well about entrepreneurship", "there are cases of people dropping out of college and becoming huge successes, right", "but there are also a lot who do not", "so it\u2019s not necessarily causation", "then you also have a lot of people who say go to a harvard mba program, then they do go on to become an entrepreneur and there are successful examples", "but my position has always been exactly what you said", "if i\u2019m at least scratching my own itch, i know for a fact there is one customer", "i know for a fact there\u2019s one customer", "so i did the 4-hour workweek, my first book", "i went in to find the book that covered it and i couldn\u2019t find it", "i was like, all right, there\u2019s jack welch over there, how to build a fortune 500 company, not interested", "then there\u2019s like money\u2019s not important \u2013 give away everything", "i\u2019m like, i\u2019m not sure i\u2019m in that camp either", "where\u2019s the thing in the middle", "so it just ended up being a collection of those experiences for myself", "which, by the way, since you brought it up, i wanted to make sure i was at least able to say this", "i read the 4-hour workweek right when i started toms", "there\u2019s so many things that i took from that book that allowed toms to have this incredible growth", "we never had investors, which is unheard of when you go from $0 to $500 million in seven years", "the reason we were able to build so rapidly is we outsourced so many things", "i never understood how you could operate so lean had i not read that book", "thank you", "i think i\u2019d sent tim many pictures over the years of me going like this with the no", "4", "it\u2019s usually when i\u2019m sailing or playing polo or doing something fun", "i\u2019m like, there\u2019s a lot of people that we\u2019ve outsourced a lot of this work to that are working really hard right now, but i\u2019m not and things are continuing to do great", "i know that wasn\u2019t the only purpose of the book, but it really made an impact on me and a lot of our early staff all read it", "because when you\u2019re building a company, when you try to do everything yourself, it\u2019s really hard to grow as fast as you can", "but the minute you let go of some of that control and you\u2019re outsourcing as many different things as you can, yeah, your margin might not be the same initially, but you can prove the model, you can get the top line sales, and then you can always come back and improve the margin later by bringing that stuff in house", "but anyways, thank you", "well, thank you", "that makes my day", "i think one of the negatives as starting as an entrepreneur at age 18 is you\u2019re so focused on your work, you have very little time for other stuff in your life", "i was seeing that my friends were having much more fun social lives than me because i was working all the time", "the way that i made a deal with myself was \u2013 and that was my way of still having some form of balance in my life", "i think the word \u201cbalance,\u201d we could have a whole two-hour conversation about the concept of balance because i think people look at it in so many different ways", "for me, the only way i could even have a thought of balance was this 11 months just going crazy, working as an entrepreneur and then that month off", "my sister and i had been to all these amazing countries on the amazing race", "one of the countries we quickly went through was brazil and argentina", "i always liked really immersing myself in whatever that country was known for", "so i got a guidebook and as you know very well, the first thing that came up and that argentina is known for is the tango", "i had not written a book yet, so i didn\u2019t know that it was possible to learn the tango at the level that you did", "i was a little bit more \u2013 well, i just didn\u2019t have the rhythm or the dancing skills and frankly, i didn\u2019t want to spend my month off learning something that i probably thought i would never use again", "so i decided not to do tango", "instead, i turned to horse polo", "i grew up in texas, had ridden horses before", "argentina is really well known for polo", "i always thought it was a very romantic, cool, adrenaline sport", "i signed up for polo camp at this place called la tarde", "i got there and after being there for a few days, i got bucked off a horse a bunch, almost was in the hospital the first week", "it was dangerous, but it was a good danger", "every morning i woke up like, i\u2019m going to tackle this horse and i\u2019m going to hit this ball", "i did that for a couple weeks", "the other thing that argentina is really well known for is their malbec wines", "if you like to drink red wine, malbecs are fantastic", "i decided to spend, when i wasn\u2019t playing polo, time in these different vineyards and wine cafes", "in the wine cafes is when i ultimately met a few women that were doing some volunteer work, which ultimately led to the idea that there were all these kids that didn\u2019t have shoes", "i\u2019m jumping a little forward in the story", "but i chose argentina ultimately because it was my way of taking a month off and recharging and learning something new, which was polo", "let\u2019s jump right into it", "you mentioned meeting these women", "i\u2019d been in argentina for about three weeks", "here you have buenos aires, which is an amazing city", "there\u2019s some poverty and homeless and all the same things we have as problems here in our major cities in the united states", "but you go an hour outside or two hours outside the city, where we were going a lot for the horses and fields to play polo", "as i was seeing this because i was going to and from the city almost every day for the polo and for getting out to the farms, i think it was having an impression on me", "but it wasn\u2019t something that was leading to an action", "it was just like, gosh, this is really intense", "this is really sad", "i can\u2019t believe there\u2019s this much poverty just an hour from this great city", "almost everyone was speaking spanish the whole time i was there", "i was trying to learn it, but i was not doing a good job", "i could kind of get around with the spanish that i learned in three weeks, but it was getting exhausting", "you\u2019re much better at learning languages and learning very quickly, as we know from reading your books", "but for me, i had not been blessed with that ability yet", "so i was just sitting at dinners most nights listening to everyone speak spanish and it was like charlie brown\u2019s teachers, blah, blah, blah", "i\u2019d be playing mental solitaire in my head until finally someone who could speak english would ask me a question", "when i hear three women speaking english, i\u2019m just like a bee on honey", "whoa, what are you guys doing", "it\u2019s so fun to talk to these women", "they had been there for about the same amount of time as me", "two were from the u.s., one was from the u.k", "they were going around to wealthy families in buenos aires collecting slightly used shoes and taking them to these towns and villages outside the city where kids needed shoes", "it was amazing because i\u2019d just been for three weeks seeing kids in the streets, not in school clearly, and not wearing shoes", "i was amazed by the fact that this was the limiting factor in their education", "but also believed it because i had seen all these kids on the streets", "i\u2019m a very curious person", "i\u2019d been playing polo for three weeks", "i was looking for something more to round out my month experience", "i said, \u201ci\u2019ve never done anything like this, but can i come and help in some way", "if you\u2019re going to be distributing all these shoes in the next week, can you use another set of hands?\u201d they said, \u201cabsolutely, we\u2019d love for you to come.\u201d when we got there, the kids had been told that they were going to get shoes this day", "there was already this incredible excitement in the air", "when we pulled in, the kids and some of the parents just started appearing from all these nooks and crannies in this town that was right next to a garbage dump", "exactly what you can picture if you\u2019ve seen slumdog millionaire", "that\u2019s exactly what it felt like", "but there was an incredible and enthusiasm because they\u2019re getting these shoes", "it was hard because the kids, a lot of them, most of them, didn\u2019t even know what size they were because all they had was a pair of flip-flops and they didn\u2019t have a proper shoe", "trying to get them fitted, that was a challenge, but we worked through it", "after all the kids had shoes, we played soccer", "we just had a great day", "he was like, that\u2019s pretty cool", "he was actually kind of \u2013 first he thought it was cool that anyone was doing this for these kids because he knew the area", "but second, he thought it was a nice gesture", "i was telling him about how awesome it was and how exciting and how much fun", "he was listening really intently", "at this time, alejo, a young guy, he\u2019s 23 years old, a great polo player and he\u2019s listening", "he got so excited", "it was actually his enthusiasm, the reason i\u2019m pretty much sitting here", "because he was like, \u201cthis is an amazing idea", "we have to do this.\u201d so just to put it in perspective too, the argentines, especially the porte\u00f1os, right", "who live in capital federal in buenos aires, they\u2019re a mixture of all sorts of immigrant bloods", "they\u2019ve got a lot of italian, which is where they get the [inaudible]", "yeah, a lot of italian", "and they\u2019ve got a little bit of german and then all sorts of other bits and pieces", "yes, a very enthusiastic bunch", "yes, so alejo, professional polo player, 23 years old, doesn\u2019t know a thing about shoes, tells me \u2013 at first it\u2019s not we", "it\u2019s you have to do this", "it\u2019s your idea, you do it", "he was like, \u201cbut i will help you", "i will figure this out.\u201d so literally, by lunch \u2013 this is a guy who has two cellphones, not because he has a work phone and a personal phone, but because he has two conversations going on at all times", "he\u2019s talking to so-and-so\u2019s brother and his his cousin and someone in the \u2013 and it\u2019s all in spanish, so i don\u2019t understand anything he\u2019s saying, but it\u2019s with enthusiasm", "he\u2019s like, this is what\u2019s happening", "so by lunch, he had already figured out someone, a friend of a friend, who made alpargatas in their garage an hour away", "before i could even say no, we\u2019re going", "we are in this", "i\u2019m supposed to leave in like four days", "in that long car ride there and back, as we really talked about it, my entrepreneur brain started thinking", "i think this could work", "because first off, i\u2019ve been wearing this alpargata", "i love it", "it\u2019s super lightweight, super comfortable", "if it gets wet, it dries right away", "there\u2019s nothing like this", "the only shoes that are in this canvas slip-on are converse or vans and they\u2019re heavier and they\u2019re clunkier", "i\u2019ve worn those all these years, but this is different", "i started to really fall in love with the product as well as the idea", "then i recognized that this didn\u2019t have \u2013 it was the first time i had an idea in my life that i didn\u2019t think of as a business really", "even though i was structuring it as we\u2019re going to sell something and give something and it\u2019s going to be a business and not a charity, i didn\u2019t think i needed to do this to make money", "i\u2019d made some money", "the driver\u2019s ed business was going great", "sales were skyrocketing", "i\u2019m a little bit less interested in starting a business to make money", "but i\u2019m really thinking this could be fun", "that\u2019s the thing i always try to make sure that people really understand in terms of the beginning motivation", "i was connected to these kids and i think this could work and help them and it was going to be a ton of fun", "now i was going to get to go back to argentina four times a year", "this was a great excuse to go to this country that i\u2019ve fallen in love with", "alejo is so fun and other people were", "long story short, we get to this guy and we\u2019re telling him, no, we don\u2019t want alpargatas", "we want to have a nice insole and arch support and they\u2019re going to make the shoe cost like five times as much money", "he\u2019s like, \u201cno one will ever buy this", "too expensive.\u201d i\u2019m like no, it\u2019s got to last long because these things wear out in a couple weeks", "just things, even though i\u2019d had no experience in shoes, as a customer, i would want this shoe to look this way, but i\u2019d want it to perform a different way", "after a couple days of going back and forth", "meanwhile, i\u2019ve now called my partners at the driver\u2019s ed business and told them it\u2019s not going to be a one-month vacation, but two months this year", "i\u2019m going to take another couple weeks to see if i can figure out this shoe thing", "i hadn\u2019t told any of my friends of what i was thinking of doing or anyone", "i just started calling my sister and girlfriends and friends of mine that i thought would appreciate this shoe and not telling them the story initially", "that was one of the key points", "so selling the product on the product\u2019s merits", "i knew that the story would get people excited, but i didn\u2019t want to really go into making this a venture unless i felt the product could stand on its own", "plus, i also didn\u2019t know how much to charge", "i needed to get people\u2019s reaction", "do you like it, no", "1", "no", "2, how much would you pay for it", "it was such a different shoe than anything else out there", "i spent a week or two really doing that", "can i ask a question", "you seem to have a long history of doing market research by asking women", "we didn\u2019t even cover the \u2013 yes", "don\u2019t they buy most of the stuff", "we didn\u2019t even cover the theta sorority collaboration with ez laundry", "that\u2019s a whole separate episode", "did you ask primarily women about \u2013 i did", "even though i didn\u2019t think it was \u2013 i thought men and women would buy the shoes, but i just felt like i didn\u2019t know very much about shoes in my life at that point", "i knew nothing", "but what i did know is that every woman in my life spent a lot of money and time on shoes", "whether it was my mom, my sister, my girlfriend, there were buying shoes", "i never really saw my guy friends buying shoes", "obviously, they had to because they wore shoes, but it wasn\u2019t like they talked about it", "i figured let\u2019s go where \u2013 this conversation is already happening, let\u2019s just enter into the conversation", "that\u2019s why initially my quick market research was women", "but it was so cool because i remember this time i had several girls over to the house or the apartment at the time in venice", "they thought they were coming over for this dinner party that i was going to arrange, but instead i had all these shoes on the table", "they were like, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d i was like, \u201cwell, we\u2019re going to have dinner, but before i want to show you \u2013 to earn your dinner", "yeah, to earn your dinner, there is no free dinner", "is i want to hear what you think about these shoes, because i\u2019m thinking of selling them", "they come from argentina", "i didn\u2019t tell them about the story", "as i saw them in my living room, trying them on and getting pretty positive feedback of they\u2019re cute, they\u2019re comfortable, i\u2019d wear them with this", "they were talking amongst themselves", "then i pulled out a bunch of photos from my trip in this village and i told them the story", "at this point, i\u2019ve never seen women so excited to buy a pair of shoes", "they bought three pairs each", "they were telling me, \u201ci\u2019m going to call my friend", "she\u2019s got to get a pair.\u201d it was like \u2013 feeding frenzy", "feeding frenzy", "it was because of the story", "it was because of the idea of one-for-one", "it was because up until that point, they had never been offered an opportunity to buy something for themselves that they usually feel guilty about", "because women buying shoes doesn\u2019t always end in happiness", "a lot of it\u2019s guilt because they have too many already", "this time, they had no guilt", "it was like the guilt-free shopping of the century", "they were buying multiple pairs", "they were telling me other girlfriends of theirs they would get to buy them", "some of the girls worked in pr and were telling me what stores to be in", "immediately i was like wow, i hit a nerve", "that was really encouraging", "that\u2019s what got the initial sales going and helped me figure out how much to charge for them", "the interesting thing about the charging \u2013 this is i think at some level why in the dictionary under the word \u201ckarma\u201d there should be a picture of toms", "we created a model that was basically to break even, not to make money", "so our whole goal was to get as many kids as shoes as possible", "we wanted to charge a price that would be the least amount that we could charge a customer and still be able to pay for another pair of shoes and have an organization", "so even though we weren\u2019t a non-profit, we went into this thinking that profit is not the motivation", "you\u2019re maximizing your margin", "yes", "the thing is, we were making all the shoes by hand in garages in argentina, which turns out is very expensive", "we\u2019re making shoes", "when toms started to take off and all of a sudden we were selling not a hundred pairs here and there, but thousands, tens of thousands and then millions, we started large-scale manufacturing", "our costs went from here to here", "all of a sudden, we had this hugely profitable business", "it\u2019s like, how did we get here", "all we did was truly \u2013 i\u2019ll never forget", "the accidental profitable organization", "it really was this crazy moment when i met with this factory for the first time, when we were moving from garages to factory", "i was like, how much per pair", "he gave me a price and i\u2019m like is that per shoe or per pair", "it was crazy how much less it was", "then we realized, okay, we can do the giving, we can do that", "and we can have a good business", "and we can make money", "that was the ah-ha moment of this is what i\u2019m going to put all my energy behind", "so in the very beginning, what names did you consider for the company and how did it end up on toms", "that\u2019s a great question", "how many people think your name is tom", "most people think my name is tom", "that\u2019s the no", "1 question", "you know that tim\u2019s a great interviewer because it\u2019s been an hour and 45 minutes until he\u2019s asked me that question", "nine times out of ten, that\u2019s the leading first question because it\u2019s so obvious", "so the name toms", "i wore this shoe today in particular because (a) it\u2019s one of my favorite shoes we\u2019ve ever made and it\u2019s also one of the first shoes we ever made ten years ago", "what happened was is i originally called them tomorrow shoes", "the reason they were called tomorrow shoes is that we thought we could make a better tomorrow by selling a pair today and giving a pair tomorrow", "so that was our pitch", "if you buy a pair today, we promise you that we will give a pair tomorrow to a child in need", "thank you", "for the first couple weeks, they were called tomorrow shoes", "we\u2019re down in argentina, we\u2019re making them", "then we start looking at all the other casual shoes in the market", "now we\u2019re starting to think about this a little bit more", "we\u2019ve got to figure out how we\u2019re going to brand this thing", "so we\u2019re looking at this shoe and in this shoe in particular, there\u2019s not a lot of places to brand it", "the most natural place would be on the back", "there\u2019s no way i could fit the word \u201ctomorrows\u201d on the back of this shoe", "it just wouldn\u2019t fit, no matter how little the font got", "so i said okay, we\u2019ll call it toms \u2013 shoes for a better tomorrow", "so toms coming from the word tomorrow", "we chose the argentine flag because that\u2019s where they were being made", "we got rid of the sun and put the toms in there", "that\u2019s how it started and that\u2019s how the name came", "it\u2019s funny because literally still to this day people call me tom", "especially in the beginning", "before anyone knew what i looked like and they assumed that there was this tom", "one of my favorite stories is in order to sell the shoes, it\u2019s like anything else entrepreneurial", "the story is as important as the product", "you\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019ve got a good product, but you\u2019ve got to convey your enthusiasm", "and so when i first got into nordstrom, which was pretty early considering how small a business we were", "they said we\u2019ll sell your shoes in these stores in southern california, but you have to commit to going every saturday and literally sitting there next to them and telling the story", "because the story was what was so interesting", "so i said, \u201cfine, okay.\u201d so i would go", "i\u2019ll never forget this one manager", "i got there on a saturday morning, bright and early", "i\u2019m all excited", "i\u2019m like, \u201chey, i\u2019m blake", "i\u2019m here to sell the toms shoes.\u201d she\u2019s looked at me and she goes, \u201coh, man", "we have a problem.\u201d i said, \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d she says, \u201cwe\u2019ve been advertising for like a week that tom is coming.\u201d i was like, \u201ci am tom.\u201d i used to carry my laptop [inaudible] quickly have it up", "\u201cthat\u2019s who you think tom is", "look, that\u2019s me", "we\u2019re the same person.\u201d the times that we live in right now, it\u2019s very romanticized to go out and raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture financing with something very complicated", "the businesses that have worked for you that we\u2019ve talked about started addressing a frustration or a need of your own, simple and low capital requirements", "at least in the very beginning", "the only business i ever raised money for was the business that failed, and that was the reality channel", "that was the thing about toms was we never raised money because we started small \u2013 250 pairs", "then it was 1,000 pairs", "then it was 2,000 pairs", "as we started growing, we were able to get bank loans and things like that to finance inventory", "that\u2019s one of the things that i think allowed us to preserve who we are today, ten years later with 75 million shoes given and all these things happened because we didn\u2019t have that influence that comes from investors and their demands and how fast you\u2019ve got to grow and things you\u2019ve got to do", "i always say to entrepreneurs, there\u2019s some businesses inherently you have to raise money for", "if you have a good idea and you can execute, every day that you wait, your idea and your company becomes more valuable", "and the more leverage you have", "and the more leverage you have", "the first time i saw someone wearing toms was like a really special moment", "it\u2019s kind of like an artist that first times sees their painting hanging in a gallery", "anyone who\u2019s created something of any magnitude is proud when they see it, especially if they see it on someone that\u2019s a stranger that bought it without you begging them on the floor of nordstrom, right", "about four or five months after we started toms, and this was before we were even in nordstrom", "we were only selling them online", "the only people i\u2019d seen wearing them were my neighbors because all of our neighbors in the neighborhood thought that it was cool that we were running this shoe company out of the apartment in venice", "so they were buying them; my interns; and then my family, of course", "i was in new york city and i had actually had a very bad week", "i had gone trying to get new customers, like retailers like the american rag", "i had just struck out", "new yorkers wanted nothing to do with this shoe", "i was going back to l.a", "a little bit with my tail between my legs", "i wasn\u2019t even wearing toms", "i was wearing some running shoes or something because i\u2019d gone for a run in the park earlier that morning and then i was rushing to the airport", "i get to the american airlines check-in counter", "i\u2019m doing the kiosk", "i\u2019m not checking bags, just doing it quickly", "i look to my right and there\u2019s this woman and she\u2019s wearing a red pairs of toms", "mid-30s, wearing a pair of jeans, a pair of red toms and i\u2019m super excited", "but at the same time, i\u2019ll really curious", "like where\u2019d you get those", "what do you think about them", "my marketing head, my focus group head just goes straight to it", "so i say \u201cexcuse me", "i couldn\u2019t help but notice these red shoes you\u2019re wearing", "they\u2019re really cool", "what are they?\u201d i\u2019m still doing the check-in because i don\u2019t want to act like i\u2019m too interested right and giving it away", "she looks at me and her eyes kind of widen, and she goes \u201cthey\u2019re toms", "toms shoes.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201coh, that\u2019s cool", "that\u2019s great.\u201d i\u2019m kind of just taking, waiting to see what she says", "i could tell, she\u2019s looking at me like no, i have more to tell", "so i kind of turned to her and she looks at me like really intently", "she goes, \u201cno, i don\u2019t think you understand", "this is the most amazing company in the world", "when i bought this pair of shoes, they gave a pair for a child in argentina.\u201d i was like, \u201coh, really?\u201d she continued, \u201cthere\u2019s this guy", "he lives in los angeles", "i think he lives on a boat.\u201d she literally starts telling me my life story", "word for word", "like with more passion than my mom tells it", "it was incredible", "she\u2019s going on and on about this and that", "at some point, i was like, oh gosh, i have to tell her who i am now", "there\u2019s other people listening", "she\u2019s animated", "i say to her, \u201cexcuse me", "actually, sorry to interrupt", "but i\u2019m blake", "i started toms.\u201d she just pauses", "it\u2019s like deer in headlights", "you could hear a pin drop", "she looks at me", "she looks at me again", "she goes, \u201cwhy did you cut your hair?\u201d but the interesting thing about that question and what i learned a huge business lesson in this question", "the reason she knew i cut my hair is she had watched every video on youtube about our shoe giving", "this is 2006, same year youtube launched", "because there wasn\u2019t a lot of content on there, our videos got a lot of views back then", "she\u2019d watched it and seen it", "i realized she wasn\u2019t just a customer", "she took the time out of her check-in to tell me the entire story", "she was an evangelist for toms", "so much that she didn\u2019t recognize me because i had cut my hair short like this", "before in the videos, it was really long and bushy", "it was so funny because on the way home, i realized we didn\u2019t need to focus on marketing and advertising", "that\u2019s not what got this girl to buy a pair of shoes", "we need to focus on doing our giving and making sure that content was easily sharable with our customers", "because if she was this passionate to tell a stranger at the airport, surely she had posted on facebook about it, tweeted about it, probably bought a pair for her friend for christmas or whatever", "so it was an amazing experience for me", "it really has dictated our whole philosophy on marketing for the past ten years", "if we do what we say we\u2019re going to do and we create interesting content that allows our customers to share with pride what they\u2019ve done, because it\u2019s really them", "we set it up, but unless we sell shoes, we don\u2019t give them away", "it\u2019s what they\u2019ve done", "then the momentum can build", "i think that\u2019s why we had this exponential growth", "this is a related one", "this is actually from the extended family known as the internet", "this is not like the drunk, angry uncle though", "this is the nicer member of that christmas party", "so daniel roddick, i think that\u2019s his name \u2013 i\u2019m going to shorten this a little bit", "\u201cthere\u2019s a term i\u2019ve heard used before called wfio.\u201d which is pronounced whif-ee-oh, which stands for \u201cwe\u2019re fucked; it\u2019s over.\u201d essentially it\u2019s when your business seems it\u2019s on the brink of failure", "you\u2019re running out of cash", "pr crisis [inaudible] etc", "the question \u2013 and it goes on", "this is a long question", "but i was just wondering if you had any particular examples", "wfios", "yeah, from toms", "if there were any sort of existential threats when you\u2019re like oh, boy", "there\u2019s one that\u2019s as clear as day", "this is in the second year", "we now have made that transition from making them in garages to a big factory, knowing nothing about how to negotiate with factories and factories can smell naivete a mile away", "we totally got screwed over by a factory", "we had taken all these big orders", "we had taken all the cash that we had", "not just toms, but like me personally, out of my personal checking account, to order all these shoes, knowing that we were going to sell them for a profit and then we would be able \u2013 so it was a cash flow thing", "i\u2019ll never forget", "i was with my dad and it was the day that i was getting the sailboat that i was going to live on", "i lived on a sailboat for six years", "it\u2019s a whole other story about essentialism and not having stuff you don\u2019t need in life and simplifying your life, which i was very intent on doing after spending so much time in argentina", "so i\u2019m going to get the boat with my dad", "it\u2019s supposed to be a great day in my life", "i get a call", "it\u2019s sean, actually", "the guy you saw", "he\u2019s like, \u201cwe have a problem.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cwhat?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cevery single sole on the shoes are falling off.\u201d they\u2019re not like not good quality, like they\u2019re falling off", "like the glue they used at the factory got hot on the way here, whatever", "he\u2019s like, \u201cit\u2019s disintegrating.\u201d all these people were expecting their shoes and all your money is in this", "we didn\u2019t have money to order more shoes", "it was definitely a wfio moment if there ever was one", "i really did think it was going to be over", "one, we were going to call these people and say we weren\u2019t able to deliver and it would take weeks, if not months, to get them", "this is at the point where we now have big customers, like urban outfitters and nordstrom\u2019s", "they don\u2019t take this news lightly", "the second was, all our cash was in there", "there was no more cash to order more shoes", "ultimately, the way we saved it was we were able to convince another factory that if they would make the shoes without any initial payment, that we would be able to pay them within 90 days and we would switch all of our business to them", "they did and they were a great factory for a long time", "but i didn\u2019t even know that was a possibility", "that came after days of heavy drinking and putting myself in a hole in which i couldn\u2019t come out", "i think every business has that", "ultimately, if you get through it, it makes you stronger", "but the truth is, it probably kills a lot of businesses too", "in retrospect, were there any warning signs or anything that you could have \u2013 are there ways that you could have avoided that", "in that particular case, i don\u2019t think so", "we didn\u2019t have the brand reputation or the cash flow to have any leverage over factories, but we needed factories", "at the same time, we didn\u2019t have the experience level to know how to protect ourselves from that", "in hindsight, there\u2019s lots of things you can do to protect yourself from factories and payment terms and all these things", "i think it was just a situation where we were unlucky and the factory took advantage of us", "they probably thought they would never get another order anyway, so they didn\u2019t take it too seriously", "if you were advising somebody \u2013 and i know this is going to be a small percentage of the audience \u2013 but actually in growing percentage, you now have people launching businesses on kickstarter", "it\u2019s like good news/bad news", "we\u2019ve never made anything but we have 5,000 orders", "we\u2019ve told a really good story", "what advice would you tell someone who\u2019s looking at manufacturing for the first time", "i would say the best thing to do in manufacturing for the first time, is have the manufacturing as close to you physically as you can, even if it\u2019s a huge difference in margin, difference in price", "because what you\u2019re trying to do in the beginning is prove a model", "you\u2019re not trying necessarily to make money", "if it costs 80 percent more to do it in your home town than doing it overseas, i would say do it in your home town where you can watch it, be there, touch \u2013 then you don\u2019t have the surprises", "the thing that kills you with manufacturing, especially from a far-off place, is the surprise when it comes not being what you thought it was", "by that time, it\u2019s too late", "so the nice things is \u2013 or you just move to wherever you\u2019re manufacturing", "one of my favorite entrepreneurs are fernando and santiago who started reef sandals", "these are argentines actually as well, that i got to know through the years being in the shoe business", "santiago moved to brazil and lived at the factory for those early years of reef to literally watch every shoe being made", "that\u2019s why their quality was so good and that\u2019s why they built such a great company", "so sometimes if you can\u2019t make it locally, you go there", "but manufacturing is where i would say most of these businesses never get off the ground or end up imploding just because it\u2019s one strike and you\u2019re out, typically", "that\u2019s a case where you really have to have boots on the ground", "i was talking to a buddy of mine who is the founder or co-founder of an apparel brand called sitka", "it\u2019s if you want to think of the lululemon for hunting and outdoor gear", "really high-quality stuff", "he went to china for the same reason", "this is a guy \u2013 i\u2019ve had some drinks with him", "the way that he negotiated his terms that he needed, because they were like, yeah, can\u2019t be done", "no, everything\u2019s got to be light", "similar to [inaudible]", "like ohmygod, this is an existential crisis", "so he went to china and he sat there", "he needed a translator", "they were doing cheers", "cheers to this", "cheers to the chairman", "cheers to that", "he was like, \u201cdo they have to drink every time i do a cheers?\u201d the translator was like \u201cyes, it would be rude not to.\u201d he was like, okay", "and so he just got everybody completely blitzed", "and then the big boss was like, \u201cdefinitely", "next week", "no problem!\u201d and so he got his gear on time", "anyway, not my recommended negotiating tactic necessarily", "there are books and so on you could read", "if i lost the material positions or the wealth or the ability to do some of the things that my family used to do, it kind of goes back to what tim was saying the guy with the sleeping bag and the oatmeal", "like i feel like there\u2019s enough people that would help me get that oatmeal and that backpack and that sleeping bag and me and my family would still live a great life", "the thing that i\u2019ve learned the most \u2013 i think it\u2019s the most \u2013 from my travels around the world \u2013 and i\u2019ve been to every country and seen almost every hardship that is imaginable, is sometimes the people who are living in the most poverty, the most rural, are also the happiest", "the reason is because their life is so simple that they spend their time in relationships", "like it\u2019s amazing to see \u2013 i\u2019m very close with many families in ethiopia", "we spend a lot of time there", "we do manufacturing there", "when you get to rural ethiopia, you see the amount of time that they just spend in laughter and games and playing", "it\u2019s because there\u2019s not much else to do because they don\u2019t have anything else", "basically, their only daily chores is making sure they have water and food", "other than that, it\u2019s just all about relationship and loving on one another", "i think it\u2019s a tricky time we live in now", "we get caught in the cycle of having to support these lifestyles that we create and oftentimes we spend so much money trying to do that, that we don\u2019t end up enjoying the life that we have", "i will say that\u2019s one thing that in my maturing and learning and studying over the years, i have gotten much better at and put much more premium on", "i don\u2019t work 11 months, lights out, and then just for that one month off anymore", "i make sure i am experiencing \u2013 i mean, yesterday, tim texted me to have a pre-call and i was surfing all day in santa barbara", "i didn\u2019t have my phone on", "i didn\u2019t get back to him until 10:00 at night because i was like, you know what", "i had a couple really long days before this", "i want to have a lot of fresh energy for this today, so i took the whole day and went surfing with one of my best friends and spent time all morning with my son", "those are the things that are important", "i didn\u2019t always realize that", "i think that you really can\u2019t lose everything when what you care about are the people and the memories you have", "ladies and gentlemen, blake mycoskie"]}
