This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I am sitting in a freezing cold house with an overdose of oolong tea and the unnamed crazy Bulgarian who\u2019s back to his antics to help with this book launch. Male Speaker: Samo Levski! Tim Ferriss: I have no idea what that means, but he\u2019s fun to have around, like Mini-Me. All right, the next episode that you are going to listen to was recorded live in the city of angels, Los Angeles, in front of a sold-out audience of around 2,000 people at Summit L.A. \u201917. You can check out what Summit is all about at summit.co, and you can find links to everything \u2013 all the show notes, all the good stuff \u2013 from this conversation \u2013 which is freaking hilarious; it\u2019s quite a roller coaster \u2013 with Brian Grazer at tim.blog/podcast. So, you can find all the links, goodies, favorite books \u2013 all the stuff from every episode at tim.blog/podcast, and if you haven\u2019t checked it out, take a look at the latest crazy project that is launching right now: TribeOfMentors.com. That is my new tome, and you can see sample chapters and the full list of mentors from every possible discipline you can imagine. You\u2019re always asking, \u201cHow can I find a mentor?

So, without further ado \u2013 as I like to say before I talk even more \u2013 please enjoy this conversation with the incredible, entertaining, and ever so effective Brian Grazer. How\u2019s everybody doing today? It\u2019s all downhill after that intro, I\u2019m afraid. The secret to happiness is low expectations, at least for me. Our guest today is the real draw, and I\u2019m so excited to be speaking with him, but before we get to that, let\u2019s just roll a little sizzle reel that we have to whet your appetite. So, AV guys, please roll the reel. [Video montage of clips from Brian Grazer\u2019s work] Tim Ferriss: So, as some of you know, I\u2019m just a professional dilettante who sometimes gets to interview people who are world-class at what they do, and this is certainly the case. I\u2019ve got a quick housekeeping question for people who are backstage: The clock says 55 minutes. I can spend that much on one movie. I assume I have 90 minutes. Head nod or no? Do we have clarity? Yes? Okay, great. So, let me do a little read. This is a rarely cited live edition of The Tim Ferriss Show, so thank you for coming. So, who is our guest today? Brian Grazer, as you know, is an Academy Award- and Emmy Award-winning producer whose films and television shows have been nominated for 43 Oscars and 187 Emmys. Just let that sink in for a second. There are people whose careers are defined by being Emmy-nominated one time \u2013 187. His movies include A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, American Gangster, 8 Mile, Friday Night Lights, Parenthood, and Splash. His television shows include the recent Genius about Albert Einstein, Empire, 24, and Arrested Development. Grazer has been named one of Time magazines 100 most influential people in the world, and his book A Curious Mind: The Secret to a Bigger Life is a New York bestseller. Please welcome to the stage Brian Grazer. Brian Grazer: Okay, here we are. Tim Ferriss: Here we are. We\u2019re using two sets of mics because, as some of you may know, two is one and one is none. Always have a backup. So, I thought of many hundreds of ways we could start this, but I\u2019m going to use a tried and true playbook. The way that I think all good interviews start is by talking about 4\u201910\u201d Jewish women. So, could you please tell us about your grandmother? Brian Grazer: Okay, grandmother. I had a pretty normal family \u2013 actually, it looked like it was normal. In the entire family, I had one person that was a champion of me, that was a believer, and that was my Grandma Sonia, to whom I dedicated my book and to whom I should be dedicating everything. And, you really just need one believer. She was a tiny, little, feisty renegade named Sonia. She was about 4\u201910\u201d, and she would watch me \u2013 I\u2019d see her every week, and as an elementary school student, she\u2019d tell me I was going to be special, that I am special, and she meant it in the best sense, and I would be looking at my report card, and it was all Fs. Everything was an F. And, there was a point where I thought, \u201cThere is really no empirical data that supports that I\u2019m going to be special,\u201d but nothing defied her, nothing could wear her down. And, she was also an early supporter of me asking questions and using curiosity as a force or engine to understand things because \u2013 and, we spoke for only a minute \u2013 I was struck with dyslexia, but it wasn\u2019t thought of as dyslexia then. I was just embarrassed that I couldn\u2019t answer questions and read books, and you sort of duck and hide. So, the dyslexia \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s sad, but clearly, you\u2019re very smart and very curious, and we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time on curiosity. But, before we get to \u201cBrian Grazer,\u201d I\u2019d like to talk about \u201cBrian Grazer the Younger,\u201d not to be confused with the Roman of the same name. It\u2019s easy to look at people sitting on one of these stages and assume that they\u2019re superheroes who have been hitting home runs with every at-bat. I want to specifically talk about \u2013 and, I don\u2019t actually know the full story, but could you tell us about your experience being cut from the football team? Brian Grazer: Oh, okay. First of all, I\u2019m from Los Angeles. I\u2019m from the San Fernando Valley \u2013 the flat part. [Audience member whistles] Really? Okay. So, I went to Chatsworth High School, Nobel Junior High. [Audience cheer] Come on. Really? So, I\u2019m at Chat \u2013 first of all, I was a very feisty kid, and I was very resourceful, had a lot of energy, and could keep up in sports with all of my friends in elementary school and junior high. When we transitioned into high school, all my friends became 6\u20193\u201d or 6\u20194\u201d, and as you saw, I\u2019m\u2026my license says 5\u20198\u201d. I\u2019m not sure. So, in any event, I thought I could play football. I went out for football, did Hell Week \u2013 which is what it sounds like \u2013 and I got through it, and the coaches said, \u201cOkay, everybody in an auditorium.\u201d So, there were about 300 kids in the auditorium, and they were to state \u2013 the job was your name and your status. So, it would be, \u201cPerry Shelmyer, tailback. Richard Cox\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m giving the real names \u2013 \u201cquarterback. \u201cBrian Grazer, tailback. Incorrect!\u201d Everything stopped. After he said, \u201cIncorrect,\u201d Coach Ogawa said, \u201cCut!\u201d So, I got cut from high school football in front of about 300 kids, and it was \u2013 look, it was momentarily \u2013 or, maybe a little longer than that \u2013 traumatizing because before I had to give my name and status, I was a human being, and once I did that, I was no longer a human being \u2013 certainly in that room. And, it stuck with me, and that\u2019s\u2026 It stuck with me, and I retained the memory of those ten seconds. It gave life to \u2013 when I read a book, it was called Friday Night Lights. There\u2019s a lot of ways \u2013 everything is about \u2013 all content involves a unique perspective. And so, my perspective on this book was, \u201cSure, it\u2019s about a small town in Odessa, Texas, and sure, it\u2019s about what small-town living is like, and it is about high school football, but it\u2019s also about the fragility of what it\u2019s like to grow up as a young boy \u2013 15, 16, 17 years old \u2013 and that a single moment like the one I just had can be absolutely seismic in somebody\u2019s life and can completely redirect where you thought you were going.\u201d So, that was my connective tissue to this book called Friday Night Lights, and then I grabbed ahold of it, and I eventually \u2013 the short story is I ended up making it into a movie, but it wasn\u2019t that simple, of course, and then, I ended up turning it into the TV series that you guys probably know, Friday Night Lights. Tim Ferriss: Did you share that story of getting cut with people in your family or your close friends? Did any of them \u2013 was any person in your life able to help you repair that, or was that something you did on your own? Brian Grazer: Well, that\u2019s a shame issue. I probably didn\u2019t share it \u2013 no one\u2019s actually asked me that question onstage \u2013 I didn\u2019t really share that. I shared it once I made the movie and I was proud of the movie, but I didn\u2019t share it at the time, no. Tim Ferriss: Were there any role models, coaches, or teachers who acted as a counterweight to that, who perhaps helped you or particularly inspired you? Brian Grazer: Well, I had Coach Wiley. Coach Wiley was a football coach, and kind of tough, but he was also the swim coach, and I had this accidental experience of being incredibly good as a 100-butterfly swimmer, and it was the oddest thing because I felt so badly about myself because of the football that I went into track, and I did gymnastics, but that wasn\u2019t very satisfying. I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll try something else.\u201d It\u2019s also a way to duck out of first period. So, I went out for swimming, and the worst \u2013 so, we had a pre-meet\u2026Los Angeles city meet. There\u2019s about 60 schools in Los Angeles City. He goes, \u201cGrazer, Lane 8!\u201d, but I\u2019d never really swam the butterfly. I just held the side of the thing, and I swam a little bit like that \u2013 freestyle \u2013 and he goes, \u201cLane 8! Butterfly.\u201d I go, \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d So, I become alert, and I get in Lane 8. Lane 8 \u2013 let me tell you \u2013 is the worst lane because you\u2019re getting all the flow-over and everything else, and you\u2019re kind of bobbing as you\u2019re swimming. I\u2019m swimming this butterfly that I hadn\u2019t really swam, and I hit the end of the pool, and I thought everybody was out of the pool. Wiley\u2019s there with a clock, and he goes, \u201cYou just broke the city record!\u201d And, I\u2019m going, \u201cOh, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d And, I looked, and everyone was behind me, and he became my hero because he then championed me. My grandmother could relay it off to Coach Wiley. Tim Ferriss: Now, if\u2026 I\u2019m just imagining the mutant-like shoulder mobility that somehow granted you this gift, but I\u2019m not going to dwell on that. It\u2019s my understanding \u2013 based on my homework \u2013 that you dropped out of college, or that you dropped out of school, and that a teacher recommended that you do that. Is that accurate, or am I reading the wrong vandalized page on the internet somewhere? Brian Grazer: Well, it\u2019s in there somewhere, but it\u2019s more that as a freshman in college, there was a speech \u2013 this really parallels with what\u2019s going on right now. There\u2019s a metric involved. I was in speech class, and there were about 125 kids in this freshman speech class \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Is this \u201cspeech\u201d as in a public speaking class? Brian Grazer: Public speaking class, and it was a Mr. French. That sounds like a television name. In any event, Mr. French says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay behind?\u201d So, I stay behind, Mr. French puts his arm around me \u2013 I remember exactly what he looked like \u2013 and he said, \u201cI want to make a recommendation. My recommendation is that you discontinue going to college. I\u2019ve been watching you. You\u2019ve been in the class. I really think this is a \u2013 not futile, but a little bit of a waste of time for everybody.\u201d And, I thought about it. I thought, \u201cWow, what is this guy \u2013 this is horrible!\u201d So, I didn\u2019t quit college. I did stay in college, but he was pretty emphatic about going to an occupational school, which he recommended. Tim Ferriss: What was the occupational school? Brian Grazer: Oh, it was \u2013 it\u2019s on Woodman Avenue, but you\u2019re working with your \u2013 anything to do with working with your hands. Tim Ferriss: What effect \u2013 Brian Grazer: He would know. Tim Ferriss: What effect did that have on you, that transition into occupational school? Brian Grazer: Well, I powered through \u2013 somehow got through that class. I got a C or something. I did stay in college. I graduated USC \u2013 I did pretty well, actually, because I somehow found a system in the last two years. I had a test \u2013 just a system of being able to synthesize and literally integrate it into my system just before I went to sleep at night, so I was able to assimilate it and actually perform. So, it wasn\u2019t just memorized, it was assimilated. Tim Ferriss: What was your system? Brian Grazer: Well, the system was really \u2013 I would just continue to aggregate what was going on in the class \u2013 Tim Ferriss: By writing it down? Brian Grazer: Sorry? Tim Ferriss: By writing it down? Brian Grazer: By writing it down, reading books, and yellow-penning stuff. And then, I would continue \u2013 I was always almost editing the system like a movie as I was propelling myself through the class, and when it came to any big test, I was at a point where I\u2019d synthesized it to something I could really look at in less than an hour before I went to bed, and I wasn\u2019t really \u2013 now, I would say it was a way \u2013 it did enter my subconsciousness, and I was able to do well. But then, I did discontinue going to law school. I think that\u2019s where you\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Right. Got it. Why did you discontinue going to law school? Brian Grazer: I thought there would be no way I could pass those tests. Tim Ferriss: Why did you go to law school? Brian Grazer: Well, I didn\u2019t really know what to do. So, when you graduate college, you don\u2019t know what to do. You guys probably \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I still don\u2019t know what to do. Brian Grazer: You clearly know what to do. You\u2019re here. But, I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I thought, \u201cWell, one of these\u2026 I\u2019ll go to law school.\u201d And so\u2026okay, what happened is I thought, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get into law school,\u201d and then I\u2019m living in an apartment complex in Santa Monica, and I overhear these three guys that had all just graduated law school, and one of them says, \u201cYeah, man, I just left the cushiest job.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWow, what an interesting word \u2013 cushy job. It must mean \u2018really easy.\u2019\u201d So, I literally opened up the screen \u2013 the window \u2013 and closed the drapes so I could really listen in. And, he said, \u201cYeah, it was so easy. It was a $5.00 per hour job, and I got a company car, and it was at Warner Brothers in the legal department,\u201d and he said his name, Peter Knecht, but I literally \u2013 when they walked away, I got the number \u2013 843-6000, just dialed 411, got the number \u2013 and I called and said, \u201cI understand you might be looking for a law clerk, and I\u2019m preparing myself to go to law school, and I\u2019d love to come in and meet.\u201d And, I got the job that day. So, then\u2026that lead to a lot of other stuff. Basically, then, I now have the job as the law clerk, and it literally is the crappiest little job in the tiniest little office with no windows. It was like a prison cell, but I was in there, and every once in a while, they\u2019d say, \u201cYou have to deliver papers to\u201d \u2013 they\u2019d name famous or powerful people \u2013 a woman named Sue Mengers, who was the head of ICM, International Creative Management, the most important agent in the world. \u201cYou have to deliver these papers.\u201d And so, pretty early on, I had to deliver some papers to Warren Beatty, and Warren Beatty was a giant movie star, and he was living at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and had a giant penthouse area. And, an assistant to an assistant comes downstairs to say, \u201cHand me the papers, kid\u201d \u2013 that kind of a thing \u2013 and I say\u2026I think\u2026 \u201cThey\u2019re not valid unless I get them to Mr. Beatty from my hand to his.\u201d So, I try that out, and it kind of works, and another assistant comes down, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re having trouble with this kid down here.\u201d So, his No. 1 personal assistant comes down, and I say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m just telling you straight up \u2013 these papers are invalid unless I hand them directly to Mr. Beatty.\u201d So, they go, \u201cOkay,\u201d and I go upstairs, and now, I see this Adonis \u2013 Warren Beatty \u2013 and I hand him the papers and create a conversation right away, and by accident, I expanded that conversation into an hour of talking. And, the guy really dug, me and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThis is amazing! I can do this every time.\u201d So, I start doing it every time, and I get \u2013 every person I get to go see \u2013 the author of The Exorcist \u2013 I had to drive out to Malibu, and before you knew it, I got through the butler, and I\u2019m sipping espressos on the porch over the ocean. I\u2019m only 22, but I\u2019m really learning a lot. I\u2019m feeling like, \u201cWow, this is also a great learning tool!\u201d I\u2019m also using the Warner Brothers\u2019 assets to my advantage, but I wasn\u2019t really hurting anybody; I wasn\u2019t stealing. So, that\u2019s the beginning of it, and then I just continued going to law school, but I convinced my boss \u2013 \u201cCan I stay here for one more year? I\u2019m pushing law school a year.\u201d Right\u2026 But, I\u2019ll end this very quickly \u2013 Tim Ferriss: No, you don\u2019t have to end quickly. This is fine. Brian Grazer: So, I realized that I could actually use my \u2013 oh. So, then, what happens is\u2026 So, then, I saw that a senior vice president of business affairs got fired, and he had this giant office, and it was vacant. I said to my boss, Peter Knecht, who started with Jack Warner back in the day \u2013 who leaves at lunch \u2013 \u201cDo you think I can have that office?\u201d He goes, \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d So, I now have an office bigger than my boss\u2019s, and it\u2019s so far away from my boss, he doesn\u2019t even notice me. But, I\u2019m right outside the cadre of decision-makers: The chairman of the board, Ted Ashley, the vice chairman of the board, John Kelley, and then, Frank Wells. So then, they would go, \u201cHey, you seem like a good kid. Why don\u2019t you sit on my couch and watch me work?\u201d I thought, \u201cWow, this is great. I\u2019m really learning a lot while watching them work.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Hold on, hold on. I wasn\u2019t going to interrupt, but I have to hit pause. I\u2019ve never had that happen to me. How did it come to pass that they said, \u201cHey, kid. You seem like I would enjoy having you sit on my couch, watching me work\u201d? Maybe I\u2019m the only one wondering that, but just in case. Brian Grazer: Well, I did have this tool that I didn\u2019t really imagine could be the superpower of curiosity, but I had this bridge where I could ask questions. There was a huge circular driveway where the big shots could park, and I would find my way down there when they were parking their cars, and I\u2019d say, \u201cHey, walk on up with me.\u201d One of them took a real liking to me, and his office had no desk \u2013 I admired the office \u2013 it had no desk, but it had a big swordfish that he caught, and boats and stuff, and I was thinking, \u201cWow, this is the life! This seems like the right business!\u201d But then, what I did, I had two union secretaries \u2013 I can do this quickly \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You don\u2019t have to do it quickly. Brian Grazer: I had two union secretaries that they wouldn\u2019t fire, and they were really strict because they didn\u2019t like that I was using the office for my own benefit, so they were getting really mad at me, and they got my parking revoked, and stuff like that, and it got to a point \u2013 well, I started to use the office \u2013 every single day for a year, I met a new person that was getting something done in the entertainment business. Every chairman of every studio from Mel Brooks to Richard Brooks, stars\u2026 And, I would call up \u2013 I know the speech so well \u2013 \u201cHi, my name is Brian Grazer. I work at Warner Brothers Pictures. This is not associated with studio business, but I\u2019d like to meet your boss for the following reasons.\u201d I\u2019d be three or four tiers down, and I\u2019m saying this as one assistant to another assistant, and I could wear everybody down, eventually. And then, my assistant said, \u201cWe\u2019re sick of you; we\u2019re getting you fired.\u201d I said, \u201cHold on. Before you fire me, I will give you half of my salary if you don\u2019t get me fired.\u201d So, they took half my salary \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Hold on. Just give me a few details so I can fill in the gaps. I apologize to the audience. I\u2019m from Long Island, and my brain doesn\u2019t move very quickly. All right, where to begin? First, what would some example reasons be? \u201cI want to meet your boss for the following reasons.\u201d What types of reasons would you cite? Brian Grazer: Okay, that\u2019s a real question. Tim Ferriss: I like to lead with my terrible fake questions to warm you up for the real questions. Brian Grazer: Okay. Well, what I did learn to do was to prepare so I wasn\u2019t just flying by the seat of my pants. I really, really prepared. First of all, by being in that office, I would read the trades, and I decoded the language of entertainment. The language of show business looks like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s go to a party and hang out!\u201d There\u2019s a lot more than \u201cLet\u2019s go to a party and hang out,\u201d and I was able to fly my little Cessna through this fog and find my way to understand \u2013 beneath the language, I started to understand the mechanics of how it worked, and where the leverage was. So, the leverage could be the studio because they have money, or it could be creative leverage because a director was an expert at something, or it could be that you just had IP, or it could be that create IP. So, I was able to understand the system of leverage, and so, I was able to say to somebody, \u201cI\u2019ve researched your boss, I\u2019d love to meet him for the following reasons,\u201d and the following reasons \u2013 like with Robert Evans \u2013 would be real reasons. \u201cI saw The Godfather, and I can\u2019t believe that he was involved in the creation of that plus Love Story. They were so diverse.\u201d Stuff like that. So, I was good at it. There was a little bullshit in it, too, but I was good at it. And then, I had this moment with Lew Wasserman. Basically, Lew Wasserman was the king of the entire movie business. He was the patriarch of it all, and he ran the Universal movie and television company. I was thinking, \u201cWow, I would like to meet Lew Wasserman. He is the man, and I\u2019m going to meet him.\u201d He was sort of like the elderly statesman, and he was friends with Henry Kissinger \u2013 I mean, he had it all. He was a man for all seasons. And so, I targeted a lot of his assistants, and I eventually met Melody, his No. 1 assistant, in the parking lot, way out on the lot, and I begged her, and she said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So then, what happens is I\u2019m now in the elevator, going up to meet Lew Wasserman. I get into the elevator. Now, I\u2019m on the 14th floor. I get out. He\u2019s got his hands in the air like this, like, \u201cDon\u2019t go any further.\u201d So, he wasn\u2019t like any other normal guy I was meeting. He stopped me before I could get into his office with a look like, \u201cYou\u2019re just bullshitting me.\u201d It was such a look that I couldn\u2019t say much. I was sort of frozen. He said, \u201cWait one minute,\u201d and he goes into his office, and he comes back with a pencil and a legal tablet, and he said, \u201cYou put the pencil to the paper, and they have greater value than they did as separate parts. Get out of here.\u201d So, I take the pencil and paper, and I\u2019m being escorted to the elevator, and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhat is he saying? What\u2019s going on here?\u201d And, I realize what he\u2019s saying is, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do better than this. You\u2019ve got to start writing ideas \u2013 even if they\u2019re little ideas \u2013 that you can breathe life into, or that have value.\u201d And, that was beginning of being substantial. Tim Ferriss: Did he say that because he saw, in a letter, some inkling of you wanting to create your own movies, or was there something else that led him to make that recommendation? Or, was it just a general lack of substance that he saw, and therefore, he said, \u201cHey kid, I love the bluster\u201d? Brian Grazer: He might have liked me a little tiny bit, but mostly, it just felt like, \u201cLet me give him some real advice and get him out of here.\u201d Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019m going to back up just a second to the half-a-salary thing. In that case, you were offering half your salary to an assistant who helped X, Y, or Z powerful, well-known person to prevent you from getting fired? Brian Grazer: Yeah. There were two union \u2013 one was a paralegal and one was a secretary \u2013 that were there from the previous boss, and I was just \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Was this on your lot, or near your office? Brian Grazer: On the Warner Brothers lot. Tim Ferriss: I see. Brian Grazer: Yes, on the Warner Brothers lot. Those two secretaries were there in the office of the executive whose office I inhabited. Tim Ferriss: I see. That makes more sense. Brian Grazer: So, they were going, \u201cHey, you\u2019re a scammer, cut it out.\u201d They got my parking stripped away so I had to park at the Copper Penny across the street \u2013 a bunch of stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: So, the art and craft of getting these meetings is something I want to talk about, and you\u2019re very well-known for these curiosity conversations, but do you recall how you struck up a conversation with Warren Beatty early on? Early on, everyone \u2013 I would imagine \u2013 during that period of time was trying to do that exact same thing. So, do you recall your approach or what you said that opened the door? Brian Grazer: Well, I now have a system that\u2019s much more refined than it was then, but at the time\u2026 Heaven Can Wait was built on material called Mr. Deeds Comes to Town, I believe. I should know this. But, you ask good questions. That\u2019s why you have a lot of followers. Tim Ferriss: I do. I think you\u2019ve checked the \u201cgood factual recall\u201d box. We\u2019re not even going to go there. Brian Grazer: So, I said, \u201cWill you explain to me how Mr. Deeds Comes to Town is going to become Heaven Can Wait in a fantasy? What is that going to be?\u201d The papers were Mr. Deeds. They were all interlinked. And so, I started off like that. So, I had a prop. Props are very important. Tim Ferriss: And, you\u2019ve refined it since, but I do want to talk about the early days, and then we\u2019re going to get to the current-model-of-Lamborghini version of this, but my understanding \u2013 it could also be a misunderstanding \u2013 is that there was one line in particular that you used quite a bit that caught my attention, at least. It was along the lines of, \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t want a job, but could I please meet your boss?\u201d \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t want a job\u201d \u2013 were there any other keys, if that is actually accurate? Brian Grazer: Yes, it\u2019s accurate. I would say \u2013 and, I still say \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be an ask. I just want to have a one-on-one conversation. It can be a very short conversation. It\u2019s up to you; it\u2019s up to your boss, whoever I\u2019m speaking to.\u201d Essentially, it was, \u201cYour boss is not going to be uncomfortable. I\u2019m not going to ask for anything. I\u2019m not going to position him. I\u2019m not going to ask one of those really hard Barbara Walters questions. I\u2019m not going to do any of that.\u201d So, basically, \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be safe here\u201d was the premise. Tim Ferriss: And, how did you select \u2013 it seems like your curiosity conversations began with industry insiders, but expanded. When did it start expanding to people in the sciences and all different fields? Brian Grazer: So, for the year and a half, it was just completely in the population of entertainment \u2013 principals who were getting something done in movies or television. Then, I got fired \u2013 clearly, I\u2019m going to get fired from that job, right? \u2013 from the Warner Brothers job. Sam Pasquin finally fired me. Tim Ferriss: What was the grievous offense? What was the camel that broke the camel\u2019s back? Did I just say, \u201cThe camel that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d? That\u2019s actually very easy to do. Brian Grazer: No, I know what you mean. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Brian Grazer: Well, I was doing these curiosity conversations, and I was demanding to meet all those famous people, but the straw was that I started to have \u2013 I created tremendous access with myself and their story department. The story department had all the early submissions of any script or manuscript that could possibly be sold, bid upon, or was owned by Warner Brothers. So, I was crawling under the tent and getting all that information. To be really honest, I think I actually might have tried to create a fake bid on something, and they just got so annoyed with it all. It was like that lecture of, \u201cWe could file a lawsuit against you, but you\u2019re too young, so just get out of here\u201d \u2013 a version of that. Tim Ferriss: So, you were fired, and that\u2019s \u2013 Brian Grazer: So, I got fired, but I wasn\u2019t broken down. I was fired, but I thought, \u201cWow! I am really smart.\u201d I thought I was so smart. I thought I was really cunning, really resourceful, and I thought I had researched a lot. I had met a lot of people, and I had started to understand their process, their system of how they would accomplish something, just to keep it simple. I thought, \u201cWow, I\u2019m so smart, I should go from a fired law clerk to running a movie company.\u201d It was absurd, but I did think it. So, I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to jump from that guy that\u2019s 23 to running somebody\u2019s movie company.\u201d Well, I found that that didn\u2019t work at all. So, I then started getting unemployment checks, and that really seals the deal where you know it\u2019s not working because you\u2019re getting an unemployment check. Then, I thought I would give myself a little more time to try to pull this thing off, just jump the ship. So, I couldn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t work, so I thought, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m just going to take a really crummy job. I\u2019m going to take a job as the lowest assistant and be happy with it \u2013 be present in the process of the lowest job,\u201d which was kind of an epiphany, but it was also reality. So, now, I\u2019m in the very lowest job, working for somebody \u2013 his name was Edgar J. Scherick. Edgar J. Scherick was from Harvard, and he was really smart, and he created The Wide World of Sports, and he ran ABC programming, and had left and had this giant deal \u2013 coincidentally, at Warner Brothers Television \u2013 but he also had money to bring to it and everything else. I took a job working for Edgar J. Scherick, as did another very esteemed producer exactly at my level named Scott Rudin, who I really respect. He has tremendous taste. We both were baby assistants that called ourselves lieutenants. And then, he was on the East Coast and I was on the West Coast. This boss \u2013 may he rest in peace; it\u2019s totally cool \u2013 he was either yelling his lungs out at you or giving you opportunity. So, literally, he was very happy to scream and yell at you, and he could only be happier if other people were there to watch it. And, he did that to Rudin and me, but he would give you opportunities. So, all of those little stories I wrote \u2013 I was able to sell a few of them working for this bigger guy. And so, I sold two of them, and they became movies for television when I was about 25. One was called Zuma Beach. It just had super attractive people and a day in the life of a beach, but I would say it was like American Graffiti at the beach to give it a little dignity. And then, I thought I could really be high-brow, and I sold a 20-hour miniseries on the Ten Commandments, where each commandment was used as an underlying theme in a contemporary moral dilemma. And so, I produced Zuma Beach. My boss was really embarrassed because he was Edgar J. Scherick, but then, when it got good ratings, everything was fine. It was good. And then, I started doing the Ten Commandments, and that was good, but he kept yelling at me, and was really abusive, and I kept getting a lot of job offers and amazing opportunities, so I said to him, \u201cDo you think you could give me a raise?\u201d No chance. So then, I took a job \u2013 a much better thing. Were we on that subject? Tim Ferriss: I think we\u2019re on all the subjects. Brian Grazer: Okay. And so, from that point \u2013 sorry, I know what we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re talking about transitioning into\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Broader curiosity conversations. Brian Grazer: Yeah. So, once things started to jell, and I wrote Splash, which became a real live movie that starred Tom Hanks, and a mermaid, and all that, I said to myself, \u201cThere will never be two weeks that I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m going to pledge myself; I\u2019m going to create a discipline that every two weeks, I will meet someone that is expert, renowned, or committed to something that is unrelated to entertainment.\u201d So, science, medicine, politics, religion, technology, all art forms, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done to this day without fail. Sometimes, it\u2019s more than one person every two weeks, but always once every two weeks. Tim Ferriss: Roughly, how old were you when you made that commitment to yourself? Brian Grazer: That exact commitment came at about 27. Tim Ferriss: And, when did Ron Howard enter the picture? How did Ron Howard come into the picture? Brian Grazer: So, Ron Howard came before Night Shift and Splash. Although I\u2019d written the story for Night Shift and the script for Splash, I couldn\u2019t get them made. But, I still had this very big deal \u2013 I had this big deal at Paramount because Michael Eisner and Barry Diller spotted me, and they said, \u201cThat guy that this guy won\u2019t give a raise to \u2013 we\u2019ll totally pay this guy. He is an idea machine.\u201d And so, I got this job, and that was a time when I still wanted to meet people who were in the business, and I looked at Ron Howard. He was still on Happy Days. I actually yelled out the window because I had a window in this really good building. \u201cRon! Ron Howard!\u201d I scared him because he\u2019s shy. Now, he was scared, but I called his office, and I spoke to his assistant Louisa \u2013 she\u2019s still his assistant \u2013 and I go, \u201cCome on,\u201d and I tell her the whole story. \u201cI\u2019m on the lot, he\u2019s on the lot\u2026\u201d And then, I got to meet Ron Howard. Ron Howard literally \u2013 it was the craziest thing. He hadn\u2019t directed a big mainstream movie, but came into my office, and I felt like he had an aura of goodness about him. I thought, \u201cWow. Do I need goodness? This will really be something I need to ground myself in \u2013 goodness. I don\u2019t care if he hasn\u2019t directed, I\u2019ll get him to direct. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d I also wanted to be a mainstream movie producer because I had produced television, but not a theatrical film. I said, \u201cI\u2019ll back you, man\u201d \u2013 I didn\u2019t say \u201cman\u201d; that would have scared him, too. Anyway, that\u2019s how that happened. And so, the first movie he wanted to make was Night Shift because Night Shift was an R-rated comedy that had nudity and was irreverent, and he was just coming off Happy Days and, of course, Andy of Mayberry, and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be that clean-cut guy anymore. I still might be that guy, but I don\u2019t want to be looked at as that guy. I want to do the irreverent one with nude girls, and I\u2019m not going to do that one.\u201d So, we got Night Shift made. It wasn\u2019t a hit, but it was really solid, and I was able to convince him to do Splash, and that became a really big success for us. Tim Ferriss: Man! Let\u2019s take an applause break. This is my game to lose here at this point. It\u2019s like, \u201cDon\u2019t fuck it up, Ferriss.\u201d All right \u2013 pause, breathe, one with Yoda \u2013 all right. Brian Grazer: You\u2019re doing good. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. What advice would you give to people \u2013 would you recommend that everyone in this room try to have their own versions of curiosity conversations, and if so, what advice would you give them? How can they cultivate that curiosity, broader awareness, and knowledge of the world? Brian Grazer: I have a couple thoughts. One is that I bet everybody in this audience is curious because I know the Summit Group, and you guys have gone out of your way to come here for the weekend, so I\u2019m assuming that you guys are curious. The way to further refine it or use it the way I did \u2013 of course, I\u2019d recommend it because you gain\u2026you get the value of a different perspective that is outside of the definition of what you thought you were going to experience. So, whether it\u2019s an architect \u2013 you think you know what an architect is \u2013 I thought I knew what an architect was. I was wrong. I met Rem Koolhaas, and the first thing he said is that architecture is like a living organism. I would never have guessed that he\u2019d think of architecture on its base level as a living organism. I can go through every one of my conversations where I was completely surprised, and it either shattered a prejudice or expanded a preconception. Absolutely, you should do it. It sort of reaches right into the soul of humanity, which is an access point for all of us, I\u2019m sure. At the very minimum, you\u2019re being really polite. You\u2019re asking somebody \u2013 genuinely, with eye contact and caring, you\u2019re asking them, \u201cWhat are you doing? How do you feel?\u201d You\u2019re getting into something that\u2019s kind of real, and the minute you\u2019re into some real place, it becomes a really powerful self-perpetuating force that leads to many other questions that are really edifying. So, I definitely think you should do it, and the other thing I\u2019d add to support it is that you do have to do homework. It takes a lot of case-building and preparation so that you\u2019re a good date. My pledge was to always be a great date \u2013 the best date you ever had with a guy or a girl, whatever it is, I\u2019m going to be better than that with this one-on-one conversation. I\u2019m going to keep it so they leave feeling like they got something out of it, too. It has to be win-win, and it can always be win-win. And, these conversations \u2013 oddly enough, each conversation was like each individual was like a dot living inside a greater constellation of dots, and I always had faith that they might connect someday, and I found that many of them do connect and form perspectives that are additive in storytelling. Storytelling is like a startup. Every one of these movies I\u2019ve made was nurtured from zero and was kind of a startup. So, it all works together. Tim Ferriss: For people who are excited to actually give this a shot, who sit down, find an assistant\u2019s or publicist\u2019s contact information on IMDB Pro or wherever they happen to be searching \u2013 in the case of entertainment \u2013 do you have any advice for crafting the email? What are some dos, don\u2019ts, or specific lines that you\u2019ve found very helpful? Brian Grazer: Well, you have to start with an insight about the person that\u2019s not dull, not generic. If you\u2019re generic\u2026 I also teach the graduating class at USC \u2013 so, after six years, there\u2019s one final class, and it\u2019s now called \u201cStarting at Zero.\u201d I\u2019m going to do one session where if you get the chance to have a 30-second contact \u2013 in a restaurant, at a basketball game, you see that person you want to meet \u2013 how to not blow it. Generic questions always blow it. The other thing that always blows it is to ask for information that you could get yourself. So, anything you can search for, you don\u2019t want to ask for. If you see somebody, you never want to ask, \u201cHow do I reach you?\u201d It\u2019s the worst thing. You figure out how to reach them. They don\u2019t want to stand there while you type out their email. They just don\u2019t want to do that. Now, once again, in the email, you have to connect your interests with theirs and have an insight that lands in the middle. You\u2019re going to say, \u201cGive me an example.\u201d It\u2019s really hard. Tim Ferriss: You know me too well. All right, what are other ways to blow it, then? Are there other ways to blow it that you see a lot \u2013 or, now that you\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re getting pitched and people want to have conversations and meetings with you? Brian Grazer: Okay, I\u2019ll accept that. Sometimes, I\u2019ll give a speech or have a conversation, and people will go \u2013 no, I don\u2019t want to say it that way. I will say no. I\u2019ve learned to say no. I don\u2019t like to say no because I\u2019m a pleaser, but I\u2019ve learned to say no because often, people just want to know the shortcut. They might disguise the shortcut question, but they want the shortcut. \u201cHey, how do you be a producer?\u201d I hate that question. I don\u2019t want to say \u201chate\u201d in this crowd, but\u2026 There are things that just aren\u2019t comfortable for me, like, \u201cHey, there\u2019s no harm in asking.\u201d Well, there is a harm in asking, but I think if you have an insight \u2013 you see the movie Dunkirk. You get a chance to meet the director for a second. You don\u2019t want to say, \u201cHow did you make Dunkirk?\u201d You want to say \u2013 the best thing is if you saw it. You can\u2019t pretend you saw it if you didn\u2019t. And then, you have to say the unique trait about Dunkirk, like the multiple perspectives of the characters that made it a subjective experience, or\u2026 I could just invent stuff right now, but I don\u2019t want to waste everybody\u2019s time. You have to\u2026 What was the question? Tim Ferriss: The question was about other ways that people blow it, whether they\u2019re pitching to you or pitching to other people. But, in tandem \u2013 we can come back to that, maybe. Brian Grazer: Well, I have a son who\u2019s just turning 18 years old, and I don\u2019t want him to blow it, but\u2026 A couple of months ago, he was thinking that he really wanted to go to Tulane. There were a bunch of schools that were on the list, but he was thinking about Tulane. So now, I\u2019m at Aspen Ideas Festival, and we see Walter Isaacson, who I did the Albert Einstein series with, and I go, \u201cOh, my God, you\u2019re going to meet Walter Isaacson, Thomas! Not only is he this guy, but he is the key to Tulane. He\u2019s on the board.\u201d So, he meets Walter Isaacson just before we go onstage, and he says, \u201cMy name is Thomas\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s a great kid, amazing kid. He says, \u201cHey,\u201d and they say hello, and I look away because I think things are going well. He\u2019s looking on his iPhone while Walter Isaacson is right there. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good move. You can\u2019t be on your iPhone while you\u2019re trying to create connectivity. That just doesn\u2019t work. So, I say to him, \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to meet him again,\u201d and sure enough, he did. I said, \u201cYou have to have three things in your pocket that you could say. I don\u2019t care if you talk about Gucci Mane. He\u2019s going to go, \u2018Who\u2019s Gucci Mane?\u2019 You\u2019re going to go, \u2018He\u2019s trap.\u2019 He\u2019s going to go, \u2018What\u2019s trap?\u2019 Then, you\u2019re going to say, \u2018It\u2019s mumble.\u2019 He\u2019s going to say, \u2018What\u2019s mumble?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s trap.\u2019 So, you have to have something to say. Or, sporting \u2013 \u2018LeBron got traded.\u2019 \u2018Oh, did he?\u2019 You have to say something.\u201d Tim Ferriss: How did the second conversation go? Brian Grazer: Oh. The second conversation went better than the first, but there\u2019s still room for improvement. Tim Ferriss: Whether in the early stages or now \u2013 anywhere in between \u2013 do you choose the people to have lunch with? You have a nearly infinite choice and finite time. How do you find the people or filter the people to select those you want to spend time with? Brian Grazer: Well, now, it\u2019s almost a self-perpetuating system, and people know I do this. I have a trainer that works me out, and he goes, \u201cWow! Did you see William McRaven\u2019s commencement speech in Texas?\u201d I go, \u201cNo.\u201d And so, he shows it to me while I\u2019m on the elliptical, and I go, \u201cWell, I\u2019d better meet William McRaven.\u201d And then, I got to do that, and that was amazing. How do I do it? You go to blogs \u2013 you listen to podcasts in your case \u2013 and you go, \u201cWow, it\u2019d be hip to meet his person.\u201d I said that so casually. There are so many ways to stimulate an interest to create a pool of possibilities Tim Ferriss: I could also ask you about a specific person that I think you\u2019ve met, and I also have a related question with him. Edward Teller. How did you choose Edward Teller, or why? Brian Grazer: So, Edward Teller was thought to be the father of the hydrogen bomb, and he was also creating the Star Wars program to protect the North American continent at the time of the Reagan presidency, and that was through missiles, webs, and everything else. I\u2019m just wondering if Jeff Bezos is in the room because I did have a chance to have a curiosity conversation with him about 16 years ago. He blew my mind then, and I still get to be friends with him, and I know he\u2019s speaking, but he knows a lot about Edward Teller, much more than I do. So, if you\u2019re here for that conversation, you might want to ask him. But, I did put a lot of \u2013 Tim Ferriss: \u201cBrian Grazer told me to ask you\u2026\u201d Brian Grazer: No, no, no. But, I know that he knows quite a bit. So, Edward Teller took about two years to meet, and he said to me \u2013 it took about two years, and I met him with military security around me right outside of the LAX private airport because he had a lot of Army guys, and it nearly took a cavity search to have this conversation. But, he really had no interest in me. He had no interest in storytelling, and I asked him what was the last movie he\u2019d seen, and he brought up Disney\u2019s animated film Dumbo\u2026 Not that it doesn\u2019t qualify as a movie, but it was quite a while ago. So, he just wasn\u2019t really that interested, but I just kept going. I remember Ron Howard and Tom Hanks \u2013 I had to go back to a meeting with them. They go, \u201cHow could you take it? The dude totally insulted you.\u201d I go, \u201cYeah, it was kind of a bad experience, I guess, but I got a lot out of it.\u201d So, you can gain a lot from failure. You learn a lot from failure. I learned a lot from the failure of meeting Isaac Asimov, which also took a long time. He\u2019s a preeminent writer of science fiction, and quite prolific, but I wasn\u2019t prepared well enough. About 35 years ago, I got my little coach ticket to fly to meet Isaac Asimov, and it turns out his wife came \u2013 who was also actually his psychiatrist \u2013 and I was talking at the Ritz-Carlton bar with them, and we were all drinking non-alcoholic beverages, and she just looked at me and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d And so, they literally left after five minutes. It didn\u2019t feel good. It felt like a big waste of time, but it taught me to prepare. I hope I\u2019m prepared for this. Tim Ferriss: I think you\u2019re more than prepared. Do you ever purposefully meet with people you know you will disagree with fundamentally? Brian Grazer: Yes, I purposely do. Tim Ferriss: Why do you do that? Brian Grazer: Because it shakes me up and wakes me up. Also, if you\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 just a quick snap \u2013 The Fog of War about McNamara, that\u2019s the point of that. You don\u2019t have to like him, but it humanizes him through ultimately entering his perspective as to how and why he was what he was. So, I met Daryl Gates, who I knew I wasn\u2019t going to like. He was one of the founders/creators of SWAT teams and forensics, and became the police chief of Los Angeles, and was right at the center of the Rodney King riot, and eventually was quickly removed from office. So, I do that, yes. I\u2019ve met many cult leaders, leaders of very \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say their names \u2013 very intense cults. Tim Ferriss: What did you take away from those conversations? Brian Grazer: Well, cult leaders operate the same way a dictator does. They\u2019re seductive, they\u2019re charming, they\u2019re cunning, they\u2019re intelligent, but they have a belief system that they\u2019re going to impregnate you with, and it\u2019s an interesting study to inhabit. Tim Ferriss: So, you mentioned very briefly \u2013 and, we don\u2019t have to spend a ton of time on it, but I wanted to open the door at least \u2013 eye contact. Brian Grazer: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Could you please share some of your thoughts or beliefs related to eye contact? Brian Grazer: Yes. So, I just finished writing a book called Eye Contact, but it\u2019s borne out of the world of curiosity, and I didn\u2019t even really\u2026 My appreciation for eye contact became alive kind of retrospectively. The use of eye contact, the importance of eye contact \u2013 it\u2019s a tool that can\u2019t really be replicated through anything, and I don\u2019t think it can be through A.I. It\u2019s a way to create intimacy and trust, and you learn so much through eye contact, and I didn\u2019t realize that it was so fundamental to all of my curiosity conversations. But, it was only about a year ago that I had a waiter \u2013 I go to a restaurant all the time, and the waiter said to my wife, \u201cWow, I really like Brian, but I didn\u2019t really think that he could know me well enough to like me because I didn\u2019t think he knew me,\u201d and he just said, \u201cI like him because every time he speaks to me, he looks at me directly in the eyes, and it makes me feel like a human being.\u201d I just thought about that. I thought, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really true.\u201d I know that\u2019s not deeply profound, but I knew it was deeply profound to me, and I just kept thinking about that, and I thought about how that worked in every one of these \u2013 none of these curiosity conversations would have happened; they would have vaporized or melted down on the launch pad if I didn\u2019t have eye contact. When you really have eye contact, and it\u2019s happening and coming to life, it is like a great date, and it\u2019s the best date. Through eye contact, it becomes deeply neurological, and it\u2019s very powerful, and I realized\u2026 And then, I thought back to myself, \u201cWell, when I was really amped up and everything, my partner Ron Howard\u201d \u2013 when writers would come in and meet with us just before our first movie, Night Shift, in 1982, he\u2019d say, \u201cYou don\u2019t really look at them in the eyes.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I heard everything that they said, and I can repeat it back.\u201d He goes, \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not respectful.\u201d And so, I changed it sort of temporarily, but then I lost touch, and I realized \u2013 I animated it once again. I remembered when he said it to me, and it had a lot of impact. Once again, it resonated. But, there are times where you shouldn\u2019t have eye contact, by the way. In tribal cultures, you should look \u2013 because I\u2019ve owned houses in tribal cultures\u2026 Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve owned houses in tribal cultures Brian Grazer: Well, I don\u2019t know \u2013 let\u2019s go to another question. Tim Ferriss: I actually just did not interrupt you. Please continue. Brian Grazer: Basically, I had a house on the north shore of Oahu because I like to surf, and it\u2019s a little tribal there. It\u2019s hierarchical in the tribal sense. You\u2019re not supposed to look at people right in the eyes. You look at them in the face to give them respect, and just divert your eyes a bit because that could produce a negative consequence. Tim Ferriss: So, pick your time and place. You mentioned about when you were amped up, and I wanted to ask the question how did your hairstyle come to be? As someone who no longer has hair, I\u2019m very curious. Brian Grazer: Well, it converges upon a couple of things. One was that I was a pretty successful movie producer, and I wanted to have an identity because I saw four or five successful movie producers, and they all had facial hair, and I couldn\u2019t really grow facial hair. So, their beards were helping define them a little bit, and I thought I couldn\u2019t do that. There was one producer who liked to throw stuff at people, and I didn\u2019t really want to do that. So, I was kind of at a loss with trying to create an impression beyond just being a producer, and then I was swimming in my swimming pool with my daughter \u2013 at the time, she was 6 \u2013 and I just popped my hair up, and she said, \u201cI love that!\u201d I thought, \u201cReally? So, we get out of the pool, and we go in, and I put some gel in my hair \u2013 not my gel, someone else\u2019s gel \u2013 and she goes, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome!\u201d And then, that\u2019s how it began. And then, just to further that a little bit, I did it, and it was very polarizing. A very small percentage of people thought, \u201cHey, that\u2019s cool.\u201d Maybe 20 percent. 80 percent thought, \u201cWhat a dick.\u201d I could see that they thought that, and sometimes, they said it. I just thought, \u201cWow, it\u2019s polarizing, but yet, it reveals something. It\u2019s like a litmus test.\u201d So then, I just kept going. Tim Ferriss: So, one of the many things that have really impressed me when looking back at your career is how persistently you have cultivated certain projects, and one in particular that I\u2019d like to ask you about is 8 Mile. Could you tell us \u2013 and, I don\u2019t know the answer to this \u2013 how 8 Mile came to be? Brian Grazer: Okay, sure. What if I said no, I couldn\u2019t tell you? No, I can tell the story. So, I was dedicated to having curiosity conversations. I should really know, but it was at least 20 years ago. I was in New York in a taxicab, and the cab driver had on a local talk radio show, and Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard was being interviewed by this radio guy \u2013 more than 20 years ago. So, I\u2019m going, \u201cWhoa, this guy is choosing to be called \u2018Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard.\u2019 That\u2019s his choice. He wants to be called that.\u201d So, that was already interesting. So now, I\u2019m listening to ODB talk, and I\u2019m going, \u201cWow, this dude doesn\u2019t even make any sense.\u201d But, he was getting away with it and so committed to it, I was thinking, \u201cI want to meet him.\u201d So, I found a way to meet Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard \u2013 ODB \u2013 and it was a trip. Everything cost money. I met him \u2013 he said, \u201cMeet me at the studio,\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t let me in the studio. I was on the sidewalk. Everything was like an a la carte thing. If I wanted to go in, that would cost a little. If I wanted to watch him do something, it would be a little extra. It was bang, bang, bang \u2013 everything was a la carte. So, I just chose to stay on the sidewalk. It felt like that\u2019s what I should have done. And, I just thought, \u201cHe is really interesting. He\u2019s kind of funny, but he\u2019s also speaking some truth about what\u2019s going on in the inner city, what\u2019s going on on the East Coast in this music genre that was early rap.\u201d So, I started thinking, \u201cWhat is early rap? What\u2019s going on?\u201d So, that led me \u2013 from ODB, I thought I would meet Slick Rick. Now, Slick Rick is really funny. He\u2019s a British dude who wears a patch on his eye and has to be carried in like a king \u2013 \u201cSlick Rick, the Ruler.\u201d So, Slick Rick the Ruler is really funny, but also cool, and from that point, I met Chuck D of Public Enemy, and that\u2019s another thing, and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWow, this is a really important movement that\u2019s going on.\u201d While I was in New York \u2013 because I do these missions. In 48 hours, I\u2019ll make a point to meet literally every magazine editor, and sometimes, newspaper editors. So, I can say I\u2019ve met\u2026well, I\u2019ve met one of the more accomplished newspaper editors, Frank Rich. Frank Rich was really credible, really smart, and very high-quality. I said something to him \u2013 \u201cI met these guys\u201d \u2013 and he sort of dismissed it as an inferior subculture. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a subculture, I think it\u2019s the culture.\u201d He sort of blew that off, and I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to try to look at this kind of like an equation that I\u2019m going to prove in story form \u2013 try to bring some cinematic form to this equation and prove that hip hop is the pervasive culture, not a subculture, much less an inferior subculture.\u201d So, I went on this journey to try to do that \u2013 this learning journey that was more artists, more people, blah blah blah, and I wanted to capture the humor and the truth. So, I\u2019m about eight years into this, and I\u2019m keeping it alive, and I\u2019m watching the VMAs in New York when the VMAs were super cool, and the camera pans, and I see this kid, Eminem. The camera sits on him, and he\u2019s got this icy urban glare, like, \u201cI\u2019m killing somebody.\u201d And then, all of a sudden, he becomes this fluid, self-effacing guy that smiles, and laughs, and is really elastic, and I\u2019m going, \u201cWow, what a range! This is really interesting. I want to meet that guy.\u201d So, then I go to my longtime friend Jimmy Iovine, who\u2019s one of the most important music producers ever, and is such a superstar for picking. And, he goes, \u201cYeah, I can make it happen,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t easy to meet Eminem. He says, \u201cI can arrange it. He\u2019s kind of a recluse, but I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d This is before he really blew up and became a star. So, he comes into my office in Beverly Hills, and he sits there like this, and he won\u2019t look at me. I\u2019m over here, and I\u2019m talking and talking, and he won\u2019t talk back, and I\u2019m trying every little trick, and nothing is work. It had to be 30 or 40 minutes into this, but it felt like three hours, and he goes, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, \u201cYou\u2019re out? We didn\u2019t get to talk!\u201d So, I\u2019m thinking I have to beg him somehow; I have to find some way. So, he\u2019s at the door, and I used some word like \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say it, but it was like, \u201cCome on, you can animate,\u201d or something like that, and he turned and looked at me again like, \u201cThis is not a good thing to happen to Brian Grazer right now.\u201d\u00a0 But then, he sat down, and one thing led to the next, and he told his story, which was an amazing story, which became the basis of 8 Mile. He was able to fully encapsulate what it was, and it was just a flashpoint moment where I was able to grab this, and he wasn\u2019t saying he wanted to star in it or anything, but I could tell this was it because it introduced what rap battles are, which is very cinematic, and it had a theme that I cared about. All of my movies that I care about begin with a theme, not a story, because themes are not able to be challenged. If love is a theme, it\u2019s hard to challenge that and say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in love.\u201d Or, in his case, that story was literally like, \u201cHow is he going to get through these emotional injuries to become self-actualized enough to actually perform and be liberated from all of his emotional injuries, so he can look at the audience and say what he said at the end of the movie?\u201d, which I won\u2019t say in this audience. So, I thought it was amazing, and we were able to get him to do the movie, and he ended up being the only rapper to ever win an Academy Award, and it was a great thing. He\u2019s so talented. Tim Ferriss: So, just to follow up on a bookmark from that, what you said to him to get him not to leave was, \u201cCome on, you can animate,\u201d or something along those lines? Brian Grazer: Yeah, I don\u2019t really want to say \u2013 it was a little \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You don\u2019t have to say. Brian Grazer: \u2013 desperate like that, but I had to take my last shot. He was at the door. Tim Ferriss: It seems to have worked out. Brian Grazer: It worked. It was partially antagonizing \u2013 I don\u2019t know what happened, but he talked. He came back. I have the utmost respect because I\u2019ve worked with so many actors, having produced somewhere around 100 movies, and he was the most professional. He actually acted in every frame of the movie, wrote all of the music, and composed the music, and was a father. He\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t get to see him much, but I have the utmost respect for him. Tim Ferriss: So, we saw the sizzle reel earlier \u2013 Brian Grazer: Oh. Tim Ferriss: That was a pregnant little comment \u2013 but, I think that we could talk about \u2013 and, we have \u2013 some of the successes. Do you have a favorite failure, meaning a failure that set up you up for later success, or something that was particularly helpful from the standpoint of learning? Brian Grazer: Well, I have a lot of failures. Fortunately, I\u2019ve had enough successes that it sticks out, but I do have a lot of failures, and they\u2019re different types of failures. Sometimes, when I violate my own rules and get lazy with my own rules about choice of a movie, where I get sloppy or lazy in the choices of building the foundation\u2026 Any time you say \u2013 sometimes, I\u2019ve picked a director where I go, \u201cHe\u2019s good enough.\u201d You\u2019re making hundreds of decisions. \u201cGood enough\u201d equals \u201cshitty.\u201d \u201cGood enough\u201d doesn\u2019t ever work. I have one failure of \u2013 I produced Apollo 13, and Ron, Tom, and I sort of became \u2013 we\u2019re friends and partners, and we all go, \u201cIf we can just make this good, that\u2019s a win,\u201d and we\u2019re feeling so good about ourselves because we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re making something good that\u2019s not going to make very much money, but at least it\u2019ll be good. Why won\u2019t it make a lot of money? Because everybody knew the end of the movie. They all lived. So then, all of a sudden, we make the movie, and the movie does really well, and we\u2019re all really happy. But then, the studio goes, \u201cDon\u2019t be too happy. Let\u2019s see how it does overseas.\u201d So, I\u2019m realizing, \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m on this journey. I thought I was happy, but now I\u2019m not happy. No one\u2019s happy because it didn\u2019t get released overseas yet.\u201d So then, it gets released overseas and does really well. We have a few more of these things. \u201cWait until it gets to home video.\u201d Then, all of a sudden, all the financial corridors are satisfied, and it does well. Then \u2013 I don\u2019t even think like this \u2013 now, the Oscars are coming about, and they nominate. There are five movies that get nominated, and Apollo 13 gets nominated for Best Picture. It gets nine Oscar nominations and excludes Ron Howard, which was a super bummer for him. No nuance there, it was just a bummer. And then, for him, it was really terrible. But now, we\u2019re in the Oscar race, and everyone is saying, \u201cApollo 13 is going to win 100 percent.\u201d Las Vegas odds makers \u2013 everybody is saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going to win. What are you going to say?\u201d I go, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to win. I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019ve already been up and down like this the entire time.\u201d So now, what happens is it\u2019s the day of the Oscars, and I\u2019ve got my speech right in my pocket, and I know I\u2019m going to be saying this speech because everybody said it, and in fact, some very famous investment bankers \u2013 one of them, who I didn\u2019t know, came to my office and said, \u201cI just want you to say a few words about my pancreatic cancer company,\u201d and I go, \u201cI can\u2019t think like this. You\u2019re jinxing me. This is too much pressure for me.\u201d And so, now, it\u2019s the day of the Oscars. I\u2019ve got my tuxedo on, I\u2019ve got the thing, and we\u2019re at the last award, and Sidney Poitier is going to open the envelope, and he\u2019s very dignified, and he\u2019s a very deliberate communicator. He speaks\u2026slowly. \u201cAnd, the winner is\u2026\u201d And, he\u2019s got the envelope in his hand. He\u2019s ripping it open, and it looks like he\u2019s going to say, \u201cBrian.\u201d I\u2019m hypnotized. I feel like a \u201cB\u201d is coming up. So, I get up and I walk all \u2013 well, very close to him \u2013 I\u2019m up out of my seat, and he says, \u201cBraveheart!\u201d That\u2019s not \u201cBrian.\u201d That\u2019s a movie. That\u2019s a whole other movie. So, I have to turn around and walk back to my seat, and I walk backwards because I\u2019m so embarrassed, and I walk backwards, and there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s so vivid. This got me taking sleeping pills because it was so\u2026 So, when I turned around, one chairman of one studio goes like this \u2013 \u201cLoser!\u201d \u2013 to me. So, I\u2019m going, \u201cOh, this is such a bad thing for me.\u201d And so, I sit down in a sweat, and the real astronaut that Tom Hanks played \u2013 Jim Lovell \u2013 is two seats down. He reaches way over Tom Hanks and Ron Howard, grabs my wrist, and says, \u201cI never made it to the moon either.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a hell of a story. Brian Grazer: It\u2019s a long story? Tim Ferriss: Oh, no. One hell of a story \u2013 a good story. It\u2019s a good hell, not bad hell. Did that have \u2013 actually, did it have a lasting impact, or were you able to brush it off? Brian Grazer: Oh! So\u2026 Okay, what did I learn? What I learned was certainly not to treat anything as a reality until it becomes a reality, and that reality is a fluid experience, and that reality is always changing. So, whatever data they were supporting didn\u2019t win. So basically, always stay out in the middle lane. I was pretty good at that, but I did fall out of the lane. I thought, \u201cWell, I could win, I\u2019m going to win, I\u2019m going to go up.\u201d And then, eventually, I did win for A Beautiful Mind, so that was good, but because I was in the column of feeling like anything could happen, that it could all go wrong, I almost couldn\u2019t talk on that award. I went up. I was so nervous, and I had this piece of paper, and I was shaking with the paper, and I look at Russell Crowe and say to the audience, \u201cI know that my nervousness seems imperceptible.\u201d They thought that was kind of funny, but I noticed that all of the biggest female stars in the world were in the front rows \u2013 Sandy Bullock, Nicole Kidman, every one of them \u2013 and I\u2019d known a lot of them from meetings or working with them, and they were all looking at me like, \u201cYou can do this! You can do it!\u201d They could tell I was crashing. Maybe it teaches you something about pre-anticipatory anxiety. I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: That sounds like a good answer. Brian Grazer: Yeah, it does. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned violating your rules for choosing films or working on projects, and one of the rules is that being good enough is shitty. Can you tell us about any of the other criteria that you have for selecting or choosing the movies? I guess \u201cselecting\u201d and \u201cchoosing\u201d are the same thing; I\u2019m just trying to get fancy. Brian Grazer: I start with a theme, and then I find a story that is compatible with that theme, that actually is a vehicle for that theme. So, for A Beautiful Mind, I was just being present and looking around my world, and I would see people \u2013 kids \u2013 that were stigmatized by even the mildest mental disability, and I felt shitty about it. You can see guys in this area talking into garbage cans, and they\u2019re not just talking into garbage cans, they\u2019re mostly living in an alternate reality, and that alternate narrative is the narrative of them talking into that garbage can. It\u2019s not something to \u2013 you want to understand it so it\u2019s not cruel or stigmatizing, and it took a very long time to find a story that would be in service of that theme, but I did. Ultimately, I\u2019ve always said that I\u2019m in the feelings business. As a storyteller, I\u2019m only in the feelings business because if you can ignite a feeling in cinematic form \u2013 which is an abbreviated way to connect right into your blood stream \u2013 then, you\u2019ve created an indelible experience for somebody that, if it has hope \u2013 I don\u2019t always win at this, but I try to make movies that have hope. I don\u2019t like to put negative energy out in the world. It doesn\u2019t have to be corny. Eminem\u2019s ending wasn\u2019t corny. In Friday Night Lights, they don\u2019t even win the game. They just become more complete young men, and more mature, and stronger. So, I think feelings are so central. They\u2019re the differentiator, and if you lose track of that, I think you\u2019re really lost. It\u2019s very important when you create any kind of story to create a protagonist that\u2019s suited for the population or the audience. So, you really don\u2019t want to have a story that \u2013 I don\u2019t want to end on that? Tim Ferriss: What was that? Brian Grazer: If you have a story that\u2019s designed to have emotional impact as an endpoint, which is my goal, you have to think to yourself, \u201cWhat is your audience?\u201d, and make sure that the characters that are personifying this idea are the same age or likeness as your audience. Sometimes, you forget that, and you go, \u201cWow, this is a young person\u2019s idea and I have older people as protagonists.\u201d That\u2019s often a calibration that is off. I made a movie called Fear. Fear starred Mark Wahlberg \u2013 commonly known as \u201cMarky Mark\u201d at the time \u2013 and Reese Witherspoon. And, it was based on \u2013 a lot of movies that matter to me are based on an experience like Friday Night Lights, something emotional or real that I experienced and that I would be able to capture in the story, or something I\u2019m observing. So, what happened is I have a daughter. Her name is Sage, and she\u2019s the one with my hair. So, this is prior to that. She\u2019s 3 \u00bd years old, we\u2019re going skiing, she doesn\u2019t really know how to ski, we\u2019re in the chairlift, and I go, \u201cFollow me as we dismount.\u201d She goes, \u201cNo, you follow me.\u201d I thought, \u201cThis is going to be a nightmare.\u201d At 3 \u00bd, she\u2019s saying I should follow her. At 16, I\u2019ll be completely powerless. So, I created a movie \u2013 this thriller called Fear \u2013 starring Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon, where she picks this guy that is really charming, cool, and popular, but is really a psychopath. But, the father is powerless and can\u2019t just go, \u201cHey, your boyfriend is a psychopath.\u201d He has to say, \u201cHey, are you really sure you want to go out with him?\u201d He has to really think it through, and so, that becomes this horrible nightmare film that is a very effective film. Unfortunately, I lived it through the parent\u2019s point of view as opposed to the kid\u2019s point of view. So, it shows the points of view, but it\u2019s balanced through his perspective, and the stakes are in the 45-year-old man\u2019s brain. If it were in the kid\u2019s brain, it would have made $150 million, but when I put it in the wrong perspective \u2013 even though it was an effective story personified through the parents \u2013 it didn\u2019t do very well at all. It was a good movie, but it didn\u2019t have commercial results because it was a kid\u2019s story represented through adults. So, you have to actually calibrate all these things and be very precise about it. But, I can actually apply this to any one of your startups by associative parts in storytelling. I\u2019m positive with that because I happen to believe everything is a story. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s refutable, but I think that everything is a story, and when you lose track of your story where there\u2019s a company or human being, it creates a misdirection. Tim Ferriss: Thank you for that. You don\u2019t have to worry about the time. I\u2019ll watch the time. You mentioned \u201cgood enough\u201d equaling \u201cshitty,\u201d which I like a lot. What separates a good enough producer \u2013 or even a good producer \u2013 from a great producer in features films? Brian Grazer: Taste. Just taste. Having the taste to pick the right subject, to pick the subject that is also authentic and hasn\u2019t either been inhabited at all or through this fresh perspective. So, the taste in picking the right thing, the taste in executing, knowing what is good and not good. It\u2019s completely qualitative. What some people think is a good meal, another person might not think is a good meal. There are some people who think that\u2019s a great car, and there are people that don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great car. So, I would just think it\u2019s taste alignment and the ability to execute it. So, when you build the foundational parts \u2013 whether it\u2019s your business or the business that I\u2019m in, which is making stories \u2013 you have to pick people with similar taste, and in testing that, I always go, \u201cWell, what does it look like?\u201d I want the person to say what they think the thing looks like, even if it\u2019s just a feeling. So, I used to do this little trick where I could meet a director that has very good credentials of executing great taste, but he might not want to message the same thing that I want to message. So, you really have to make sure\u2026 If I made a comedy \u2013 and, I did this many times \u2013 I produced a comedy, I got this A-plus director, and I would say, \u201cWell, what would it look like, Ted?\u201d He starts talking, and he starts talking about wide shots. Well, I know that\u2019s not right because comedy is a close-up medium. There are all these little giveaways that I\u2019m sure you guys will have that you can codify in your own manifesto. So, it\u2019s a very doable thing to think through. Tim Ferriss: Are there ways to cultivate taste? Brian Grazer: I still make mistakes, by the way. I\u2019m still very fallible. Tim Ferriss: As we all are \u2013 works in progress. Is taste something that you can cultivate? Are there ways to cultivate it, or is it more like height or something like that that\u2019s fixed? Brian Grazer: No, I think you can develop taste. You just have to go on a journey to do that. I hadn\u2019t thought of it, but you would just have to be exposed to the execution of good taste in fashion, art, medicine, technology, or\u2026 Some people see the \u00fcber-picture in the game, so you want to be exposed to those people. Why are you laughing? Tim Ferriss: I think it\u2019s a good answer. It\u2019s not a mocking smile. It\u2019s more of an \u201cI agree, thank you\u201d smile. Brian Grazer: No, no, I\u2019m cool. Some people do. They see things in an elevated way, and sometimes, they\u2019re accidents, but you should make it \u2013 I tried to make this always part of my journey, but\u2026 Harold Ramis \u2013 may he rest in peace \u2013 I adored him. He wrote Animal House and Stripes, and I met him, and he had such an \u2013 I thought Animal House was one of the funniest movies, but he had a really Harvard brainy \u2013 I guess they don\u2019t always have to be aligned, but he had a very brainy way of stating what that movie was about, and I thought, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s really heavy.\u201d And so, you know it when you hear it if you\u2019re available to hear it, but you can create a discipline where you try to sample stuff. Why is Gucci good now? Because of its new creative director. Who picked him? Pinault picked him. Why did Pinault pick him? How does Pinault pick directors? How does that work? You start going that way. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m so interested in your questions. I could just ask questions all day, but last question \u2013 Brian Grazer: We\u2019re winding down. Look at this. Tim Ferriss: We are winding down the countdown clock. There are a lot of things that are inaccurate on the internet, but I\u2019ve read that you\u2019ve said, \u201cWriting notes of gratitude always strengthens me.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but do you write gratitude notes? Brian Grazer: Yes. I have a gratitude journal that somebody gave to me \u2013 a tech titan. I said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He writes in this gratitude journal. Every day, he tries to address this piece of paper. Veronica and I gave them away at our wedding. Every person got a gratitude journal, and I try to\u2026 I want to stay in my lane. I don\u2019t want to enter someone else\u2019s lane in terms of their life choices, their value system, their economics, or their lack of economics. I want to have compassion, but I want to be in my lane, and being in my lane, I can have gratitude, like \u201cThank you for the health that I have right now,\u201d that animates my mind, my life, and my physicality. So, I want to be in that zone. Tim Ferriss: Well, I think that\u2019s the perfect place to wrap up. @BrianGrazer on all social media. Thank you so much for a wonderful time.

human being, and once i did that, i was no longer a human being \u2013 certainly in that room", "and, it stuck with me, and that\u2019s\u2026 it stuck with me, and i retained the memory of those ten seconds", "it gave life to \u2013 when i read a book, it was called friday night lights", "there\u2019s a lot of ways \u2013 everything is about \u2013 all content involves a unique perspective", "and so, my perspective on this book was, \u201csure, it\u2019s about a small town in odessa, texas, and sure, it\u2019s about what small-town living is like, and it is about high school football, but it\u2019s also about the fragility of what it\u2019s like to grow up as a young boy \u2013 15, 16, 17 years old \u2013 and that a single moment like the one i just had can be absolutely seismic in somebody\u2019s life and can completely redirect where you thought you were going.\u201d so, that was my connective tissue to this book called friday night lights, and then i grabbed ahold of it, and i eventually \u2013 the short story is i ended up making it into a movie, but it wasn\u2019t that simple, of course, and then, i ended up turning it into the tv series that you guys probably know, friday night lights", "did you share that story of getting cut with people in your family or your close friends", "did any of them \u2013 was any person in your life able to help you repair that, or was that something you did on your own", "well, that\u2019s a shame issue", "i probably didn\u2019t share it \u2013 no one\u2019s actually asked me that question onstage \u2013 i didn\u2019t really share that", "i shared it once i made the movie and i was proud of the movie, but i didn\u2019t share it at the time, no", "were there any role models, coaches, or teachers who acted as a counterweight to that, who perhaps helped you or particularly inspired you", "well, i had coach wiley", "coach wiley was a football coach, and kind of tough, but he was also the swim coach, and i had this accidental experience of being incredibly good as a 100-butterfly swimmer, and it was the oddest thing because i felt so badly about myself because of the football that i went into track, and i did gymnastics, but that wasn\u2019t very satisfying", "i thought, \u201ci\u2019ll try something else.\u201d it\u2019s also a way to duck out of first period", "so, i went out for swimming, and the worst \u2013 so, we had a pre-meet\u2026los angeles city meet", "there\u2019s about 60 schools in los angeles city", "he goes, \u201cgrazer, lane 8!\u201d, but i\u2019d never really swam the butterfly", "i just held the side of the thing, and i swam a little bit like that \u2013 freestyle \u2013 and he goes, \u201clane 8", "butterfly.\u201d i go, \u201cokay\u2026\u201d so, i become alert, and i get in lane 8", "lane 8 \u2013 let me tell you \u2013 is the worst lane because you\u2019re getting all the flow-over and everything else, and you\u2019re kind of bobbing as you\u2019re swimming", "i\u2019m swimming this butterfly that i hadn\u2019t really swam, and i hit the end of the pool, and i thought everybody was out of the pool", "wiley\u2019s there with a clock, and he goes, \u201cyou just broke the city record!\u201d and, i\u2019m going, \u201coh, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d and, i looked, and everyone was behind me, and he became my hero because he then championed me", "my grandmother could relay it off to coach wiley", "now, if\u2026 i\u2019m just imagining the mutant-like shoulder mobility that somehow granted you this gift, but i\u2019m not going to dwell on that", "it\u2019s my understanding \u2013 based on my homework \u2013 that you dropped out of college, or that you dropped out of school, and that a teacher recommended that you do that", "is that accurate, or am i reading the wrong vandalized page on the internet somewhere", "well, it\u2019s in there somewhere, but it\u2019s more that as a freshman in college, there was a speech \u2013 this really parallels with what\u2019s going on right now", "there\u2019s a metric involved", "i was in speech class, and there were about 125 kids in this freshman speech class \u2013 is this \u201cspeech\u201d as in a public speaking class", "public speaking class, and it was a mr", "french", "that sounds like a television name", "in any event, mr", "french says, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you stay behind?\u201d so, i stay behind, mr", "french puts his arm around me \u2013 i remember exactly what he looked like \u2013 and he said, \u201ci want to make a recommendation", "my recommendation is that you discontinue going to college", "i\u2019ve been watching you", "you\u2019ve been in the class", "i really think this is a \u2013 not futile, but a little bit of a waste of time for everybody.\u201d and, i thought about it", "i thought, \u201cwow, what is this guy \u2013 this is horrible!\u201d so, i didn\u2019t quit college", "i did stay in college, but he was pretty emphatic about going to an occupational school, which he recommended", "what was the occupational school", "oh, it was \u2013 it\u2019s on woodman avenue, but you\u2019re working with your \u2013 anything to do with working with your hands", "what effect \u2013 he would know", "what effect did that have on you, that transition into occupational school", "well, i powered through \u2013 somehow got through that class", "i got a c or something", "i did stay in college", "i graduated usc \u2013 i did pretty well, actually, because i somehow found a system in the last two years", "i had a test \u2013 just a system of being able to synthesize and literally integrate it into my system just before i went to sleep at night, so i was able to assimilate it and actually perform", "so, it wasn\u2019t just memorized, it was assimilated", "what was your system", "well, the system was really \u2013 i would just continue to aggregate what was going on in the class \u2013 by writing it down", "sorry", "by writing it down", "by writing it down, reading books, and yellow-penning stuff", "and then, i would continue \u2013 i was always almost editing the system like a movie as i was propelling myself through the class, and when it came to any big test, i was at a point where i\u2019d synthesized it to something i could really look at in less than an hour before i went to bed, and i wasn\u2019t really \u2013 now, i would say it was a way \u2013 it did enter my subconsciousness, and i was able to do well", "but then, i did discontinue going to law school", "i think that\u2019s where you\u2026 right", "got it", "why did you discontinue going to law school", "i thought there would be no way i could pass those tests", "why did you go to law school", "well, i didn\u2019t really know what to do", "so, when you graduate college, you don\u2019t know what to do", "you guys probably \u2013 i still don\u2019t know what to do", "you clearly know what to do", "you\u2019re here", "but, i didn\u2019t know what to do, so i thought, \u201cwell, one of these\u2026 i\u2019ll go to law school.\u201d and so\u2026okay, what happened is i thought, \u201cokay, i\u2019ll get into law school,\u201d and then i\u2019m living in an apartment complex in santa monica, and i overhear these three guys that had all just graduated law school, and one of them says, \u201cyeah, man, i just left the cushiest job.\u201d i\u2019m thinking, \u201cwow, what an interesting word \u2013 cushy job", "it must mean \u2018really easy.\u2019\u201d so, i literally opened up the screen \u2013 the window \u2013 and closed the drapes so i could really listen in", "and, he said, \u201cyeah, it was so easy", "it was a $5.00 per hour job, and i got a company car, and it was at warner brothers in the legal department,\u201d and he said his name, peter knecht, but i literally \u2013 when they walked away, i got the number \u2013 843-6000, just dialed 411, got the number \u2013 and i called and said, \u201ci understand you might be looking for a law clerk, and i\u2019m preparing myself to go to law school, and i\u2019d love to come in and meet.\u201d and, i got the job that day", "so, then\u2026that lead to a lot of other stuff", "basically, then, i now have the job as the law clerk, and it literally is the crappiest little job in the tiniest little office with no windows", "it was like a prison cell, but i was in there, and every once in a while, they\u2019d say, \u201cyou have to deliver papers to\u201d \u2013 they\u2019d name famous or powerful people \u2013 a woman named sue mengers, who was the head of icm, international creative management, the most important agent in the world", "\u201cyou have to deliver these papers.\u201d and so, pretty early on, i had to deliver some papers to warren beatty, and warren beatty was a giant movie star, and he was living at the beverly wilshire hotel and had a giant penthouse area", "and, an assistant to an assistant comes downstairs to say, \u201chand me the papers, kid\u201d \u2013 that kind of a thing \u2013 and i say\u2026i think\u2026 \u201cthey\u2019re not valid unless i get them to mr", "beatty from my hand to his.\u201d so, i try that out, and it kind of works, and another assistant comes down, saying, \u201cwe\u2019re having trouble with this kid down here.\u201d so, his no", "1 personal assistant comes down, and i say, \u201clook, i\u2019m just telling you straight up \u2013 these papers are invalid unless i hand them directly to mr", "beatty.\u201d so, they go, \u201cokay,\u201d and i go upstairs, and now, i see this adonis \u2013 warren beatty \u2013 and i hand him the papers and create a conversation right away, and by accident, i expanded that conversation into an hour of talking", "and, the guy really dug, me and i\u2019m thinking, \u201cthis is amazing", "i can do this every time.\u201d so, i start doing it every time, and i get \u2013 every person i get to go see \u2013 the author of the exorcist \u2013 i had to drive out to malibu, and before you knew it, i got through the butler, and i\u2019m sipping espressos on the porch over the ocean", "i\u2019m only 22, but i\u2019m really learning a lot", "i\u2019m feeling like, \u201cwow, this is also a great learning tool!\u201d i\u2019m also using the warner brothers\u2019 assets to my advantage, but i wasn\u2019t really hurting anybody; i wasn\u2019t stealing", "so, that\u2019s the beginning of it, and then i just continued going to law school, but i convinced my boss \u2013 \u201ccan i stay here for one more year", "i\u2019m pushing law school a year.\u201d right\u2026 but, i\u2019ll end this very quickly \u2013 no, you don\u2019t have to end quickly", "this is fine", "so, i realized that i could actually use my \u2013 oh", "so, then, what happens is\u2026 so, then, i saw that a senior vice president of business affairs got fired, and he had this giant office, and it was vacant", "i said to my boss, peter knecht, who started with jack warner back in the day \u2013 who leaves at lunch \u2013 \u201cdo you think i can have that office?\u201d he goes, \u201csure, no problem.\u201d so, i now have an office bigger than my boss\u2019s, and it\u2019s so far away from my boss, he doesn\u2019t even notice me", "but, i\u2019m right outside the cadre of decision-makers: the chairman of the board, ted ashley, the vice chairman of the board, john kelley, and then, frank wells", "so then, they would go, \u201chey, you seem like a good kid", "why don\u2019t you sit on my couch and watch me work?\u201d i thought, \u201cwow, this is great", "i\u2019m really learning a lot while watching them work.\u201d hold on, hold on", "i wasn\u2019t going to interrupt, but i have to hit pause", "i\u2019ve never had that happen to me", "how did it come to pass that they said, \u201chey, kid", "you seem like i would enjoy having you sit on my couch, watching me work\u201d", "maybe i\u2019m the only one wondering that, but just in case", "well, i did have this tool that i didn\u2019t really imagine could be the superpower of curiosity, but i had this bridge where i could ask questions", "there was a huge circular driveway where the big shots could park, and i would find my way down there when they were parking their cars, and i\u2019d say, \u201chey, walk on up with me.\u201d one of them took a real liking to me, and his office had no desk \u2013 i admired the office \u2013 it had no desk, but it had a big swordfish that he caught, and boats and stuff, and i was thinking, \u201cwow, this is the life", "this seems like the right business!\u201d but then, what i did, i had two union secretaries \u2013 i can do this quickly \u2013 you don\u2019t have to do it quickly", "i had two union secretaries that they wouldn\u2019t fire, and they were really strict because they didn\u2019t like that i was using the office for my own benefit, so they were getting really mad at me, and they got my parking revoked, and stuff like that, and it got to a point \u2013 well, i started to use the office \u2013 every single day for a year, i met a new person that was getting something done in the entertainment business", "every chairman of every studio from mel brooks to richard brooks, stars\u2026 and, i would call up \u2013 i know the speech so well \u2013 \u201chi, my name is brian grazer", "i work at warner brothers pictures", "this is not associated with studio business, but i\u2019d like to meet your boss for the following reasons.\u201d i\u2019d be three or four tiers down, and i\u2019m saying this as one assistant to another assistant, and i could wear everybody down, eventually", "and then, my assistant said, \u201cwe\u2019re sick of you; we\u2019re getting you fired.\u201d i said, \u201chold on", "before you fire me, i will give you half of my salary if you don\u2019t get me fired.\u201d so, they took half my salary \u2013 hold on", "just give me a few details so i can fill in the gaps", "i apologize to the audience", "i\u2019m from long island, and my brain doesn\u2019t move very quickly", "all right, where to begin", "first, what would some example reasons be", "\u201ci want to meet your boss for the following reasons.\u201d what types of reasons would you cite", "okay, that\u2019s a real question", "i like to lead with my terrible fake questions to warm you up for the real questions", "okay", "well, what i did learn to do was to prepare so i wasn\u2019t just flying by the seat of my pants", "i really, really prepared", "first of all, by being in that office, i would read the trades, and i decoded the language of entertainment", "the language of show business looks like, \u201chey, let\u2019s go to a party and hang out!\u201d there\u2019s a lot more than \u201clet\u2019s go to a party and hang out,\u201d and i was able to fly my little cessna through this fog and find my way to understand \u2013 beneath the language, i started to understand the mechanics of how it worked, and where the leverage was", "so, the leverage could be the studio because they have money, or it could be creative leverage because a director was an expert at something, or it could be that you just had ip, or it could be that create ip", "so, i was able to understand the system of leverage, and so, i was able to say to somebody, \u201ci\u2019ve researched your boss, i\u2019d love to meet him for the following reasons,\u201d and the following reasons \u2013 like with robert evans \u2013 would be real reasons", "\u201ci saw the godfather, and i can\u2019t believe that he was involved in the creation of that plus love story", "they were so diverse.\u201d stuff like that", "so, i was good at it", "there was a little bullshit in it, too, but i was good at it", "and then, i had this moment with lew wasserman", "basically, lew wasserman was the king of the entire movie business", "he was the patriarch of it all, and he ran the universal movie and television company", "i was thinking, \u201cwow, i would like to meet lew wasserman", "he is the man, and i\u2019m going to meet him.\u201d he was sort of like the elderly statesman, and he was friends with henry kissinger \u2013 i mean, he had it all", "he was a man for all seasons", "and so, i targeted a lot of his assistants, and i eventually met melody, his no", "1 assistant, in the parking lot, way out on the lot, and i begged her, and she said, \u201cokay.\u201d so then, what happens is i\u2019m now in the elevator, going up to meet lew wasserman", "i get into the elevator", "now, i\u2019m on the 14th floor", "i get out", "he\u2019s got his hands in the air like this, like, \u201cdon\u2019t go any further.\u201d so, he wasn\u2019t like any other normal guy i was meeting", "he stopped me before i could get into his office with a look like, \u201cyou\u2019re just bullshitting me.\u201d it was such a look that i couldn\u2019t say much", "i was sort of frozen", "he said, \u201cwait one minute,\u201d and he goes into his office, and he comes back with a pencil and a legal tablet, and he said, \u201cyou put the pencil to the paper, and they have greater value than they did as separate parts", "get out of here.\u201d so, i take the pencil and paper, and i\u2019m being escorted to the elevator, and i\u2019m thinking, \u201cwhat is he saying", "what\u2019s going on here?\u201d and, i realize what he\u2019s saying is, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to do better than this", "you\u2019ve got to start writing ideas \u2013 even if they\u2019re little ideas \u2013 that you can breathe life into, or that have value.\u201d and, that was beginning of being substantial", "did he say that because he saw, in a letter, some inkling of you wanting to create your own movies, or was there something else that led him to make that recommendation", "or, was it just a general lack of substance that he saw, and therefore, he said, \u201chey kid, i love the bluster\u201d", "he might have liked me a little tiny bit, but mostly, it just felt like, \u201clet me give him some real advice and get him out of here.\u201d so, i\u2019m going to back up just a second to the half-a-salary thing", "in that case, you were offering half your salary to an assistant who helped x, y, or z powerful, well-known person to prevent you from getting fired", "yeah", "there were two union \u2013 one was a paralegal and one was a secretary \u2013 that were there from the previous boss, and i was just \u2013 was this on your lot, or near your office", "on the warner brothers lot", "i see", "yes, on the warner brothers lot", "those two secretaries were there in the office of the executive whose office i inhabited", "i see", "that makes more sense", "so, they were going, \u201chey, you\u2019re a scammer, cut it out.\u201d they got my parking stripped away so i had to park at the copper penny across the street \u2013 a bunch of stuff like that", "so, the art and craft of getting these meetings is something i want to talk about, and you\u2019re very well-known for these curiosity conversations, but do you recall how you struck up a conversation with warren beatty early on", "early on, everyone \u2013 i would imagine \u2013 during that period of time was trying to do that exact same thing", "so, do you recall your approach or what you said that opened the door", "well, i now have a system that\u2019s much more refined than it was then, but at the time\u2026 heaven can wait was built on material called mr", "deeds comes to town, i believe", "i should know this", "but, you ask good questions", "that\u2019s why you have a lot of followers", "i do", "i think you\u2019ve checked the \u201cgood factual recall\u201d box", "we\u2019re not even going to go there", "so, i said, \u201cwill you explain to me how mr", "deeds comes to town is going to become heaven can wait in a fantasy", "what is that going to be?\u201d the papers were mr", "deeds", "they were all interlinked", "and so, i started off like that", "so, i had a prop", "props are very important", "and, you\u2019ve refined it since, but i do want to talk about the early days, and then we\u2019re going to get to the current-model-of-lamborghini version of this, but my understanding \u2013 it could also be a misunderstanding \u2013 is that there was one line in particular that you used quite a bit that caught my attention, at least", "it was along the lines of, \u201ci absolutely don\u2019t want a job, but could i please meet your boss?\u201d \u201ci absolutely don\u2019t want a job\u201d \u2013 were there any other keys, if that is actually accurate", "yes, it\u2019s accurate", "i would say \u2013 and, i still say \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s not going to be an ask", "i just want to have a one-on-one conversation", "it can be a very short conversation", "it\u2019s up to you; it\u2019s up to your boss, whoever i\u2019m speaking to.\u201d essentially, it was, \u201cyour boss is not going to be uncomfortable", "i\u2019m not going to ask for anything", "i\u2019m not going to position him", "i\u2019m not going to ask one of those really hard barbara walters questions", "i\u2019m not going to do any of that.\u201d so, basically, \u201ceverybody\u2019s going to be safe here\u201d was the premise", "and, how did you select \u2013 it seems like your curiosity conversations began with industry insiders, but expanded", "when did it start expanding to people in the sciences and all different fields", "so, for the year and a half, it was just completely in the population of entertainment \u2013 principals who were getting something done in movies or television", "then, i got fired \u2013 clearly, i\u2019m going to get fired from that job, right", "\u2013 from the warner brothers job", "sam pasquin finally fired me", "what was the grievous offense", "what was the camel that broke the camel\u2019s back", "did i just say, \u201cthe camel that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d", "that\u2019s actually very easy to do", "no, i know what you mean", "\u2013 the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back", "well, i was doing these curiosity conversations, and i was demanding to meet all those famous people, but the straw was that i started to have \u2013 i created tremendous access with myself and their story department", "the story department had all the early submissions of any script or manuscript that could possibly be sold, bid upon, or was owned by warner brothers", "so, i was crawling under the tent and getting all that information", "to be really honest, i think i actually might have tried to create a fake bid on something, and they just got so annoyed with it all", "it was like that lecture of, \u201cwe could file a lawsuit against you, but you\u2019re too young, so just get out of here\u201d \u2013 a version of that", "so, you were fired, and that\u2019s \u2013 so, i got fired, but i wasn\u2019t broken down", "i was fired, but i thought, \u201cwow", "i am really smart.\u201d i thought i was so smart", "i thought i was really cunning, really resourceful, and i thought i had researched a lot", "i had met a lot of people, and i had started to understand their process, their system of how they would accomplish something, just to keep it simple", "i thought, \u201cwow, i\u2019m so smart, i should go from a fired law clerk to running a movie company.\u201d it was absurd, but i did think it", "so, i thought, \u201ci\u2019m going to jump from that guy that\u2019s 23 to running somebody\u2019s movie company.\u201d well, i found that that didn\u2019t work at all", "so, i then started getting unemployment checks, and that really seals the deal where you know it\u2019s not working because you\u2019re getting an unemployment check", "then, i thought i would give myself a little more time to try to pull this thing off, just jump the ship", "so, i couldn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t work, so i thought, \u201cyou know what", "i\u2019m just going to take a really crummy job", "i\u2019m going to take a job as the lowest assistant and be happy with it \u2013 be present in the process of the lowest job,\u201d which was kind of an epiphany, but it was also reality", "so, now, i\u2019m in the very lowest job, working for somebody \u2013 his name was edgar j", "scherick", "edgar j", "scherick was from harvard, and he was really smart, and he created the wide world of sports, and he ran abc programming, and had left and had this giant deal \u2013 coincidentally, at warner brothers television \u2013 but he also had money to bring to it and everything else", "i took a job working for edgar j", "scherick, as did another very esteemed producer exactly at my level named scott rudin, who i really respect", "he has tremendous taste", "we both were baby assistants that called ourselves lieutenants", "and then, he was on the east coast and i was on the west coast", "this boss \u2013 may he rest in peace; it\u2019s totally cool \u2013 he was either yelling his lungs out at you or giving you opportunity", "so, literally, he was very happy to scream and yell at you, and he could only be happier if other people were there to watch it", "and, he did that to rudin and me, but he would give you opportunities", "so, all of those little stories i wrote \u2013 i was able to sell a few of them working for this bigger guy", "and so, i sold two of them, and they became movies for television when i was about 25", "one was called zuma beach", "it just had super attractive people and a day in the life of a beach, but i would say it was like american graffiti at the beach to give it a little dignity", "and then, i thought i could really be high-brow, and i sold a 20-hour miniseries on the ten commandments, where each commandment was used as an underlying theme in a contemporary moral dilemma", "and so, i produced zuma beach", "my boss was really embarrassed because he was edgar j", "scherick, but then, when it got good ratings, everything was fine", "it was good", "and then, i started doing the ten commandments, and that was good, but he kept yelling at me, and was really abusive, and i kept getting a lot of job offers and amazing opportunities, so i said to him, \u201cdo you think you could give me a raise?\u201d no chance", "so then, i took a job \u2013 a much better thing", "were we on that subject", "i think we\u2019re on all the subjects", "okay", "and so, from that point \u2013 sorry, i know what we\u2019re talking about", "we\u2019re talking about transitioning into\u2026 broader curiosity conversations", "yeah", "so, once things started to jell, and i wrote splash, which became a real live movie that starred tom hanks, and a mermaid, and all that, i said to myself, \u201cthere will never be two weeks that i don\u2019t \u2013 i\u2019m going to pledge myself; i\u2019m going to create a discipline that every two weeks, i will meet someone that is expert, renowned, or committed to something that is unrelated to entertainment.\u201d so, science, medicine, politics, religion, technology, all art forms, and that\u2019s what i\u2019ve done to this day without fail", "sometimes, it\u2019s more than one person every two weeks, but always once every two weeks", "roughly, how old were you when you made that commitment to yourself", "that exact commitment came at about 27", "and, when did ron howard enter the picture", "how did ron howard come into the picture", "so, ron howard came before night shift and splash", "although i\u2019d written the story for night shift and the script for splash, i couldn\u2019t get them made", "but, i still had this very big deal \u2013 i had this big deal at paramount because michael eisner and barry diller spotted me, and they said, \u201cthat guy that this guy won\u2019t give a raise to \u2013 we\u2019ll totally pay this guy", "he is an idea machine.\u201d and so, i got this job, and that was a time when i still wanted to meet people who were in the business, and i looked at ron howard", "he was still on happy days", "i actually yelled out the window because i had a window in this really good building", "\u201cron", "ron howard!\u201d i scared him because he\u2019s shy", "now, he was scared, but i called his office, and i spoke to his assistant louisa \u2013 she\u2019s still his assistant \u2013 and i go, \u201ccome on,\u201d and i tell her the whole story", "\u201ci\u2019m on the lot, he\u2019s on the lot\u2026\u201d and then, i got to meet ron howard", "ron howard literally \u2013 it was the craziest thing", "he hadn\u2019t directed a big mainstream movie, but came into my office, and i felt like he had an aura of goodness about him", "i thought, \u201cwow", "do i need goodness", "this will really be something i need to ground myself in \u2013 goodness", "i don\u2019t care if he hasn\u2019t directed, i\u2019ll get him to direct", "i\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d i also wanted to be a mainstream movie producer because i had produced television, but not a theatrical film", "i said, \u201ci\u2019ll back you, man\u201d \u2013 i didn\u2019t say \u201cman\u201d; that would have scared him, too", "anyway, that\u2019s how that happened", "and so, the first movie he wanted to make was night shift because night shift was an r-rated comedy that had nudity and was irreverent, and he was just coming off happy days and, of course, andy of mayberry, and he said, \u201ci don\u2019t want to be that clean-cut guy anymore", "i still might be that guy, but i don\u2019t want to be looked at as that guy", "i want to do the irreverent one with nude girls, and i\u2019m not going to do that one.\u201d so, we got night shift made", "it wasn\u2019t a hit, but it was really solid, and i was able to convince him to do splash, and that became a really big success for us", "man", "let\u2019s take an applause break", "this is my game to lose here at this point", "it\u2019s like, \u201cdon\u2019t fuck it up, ferriss.\u201d all right \u2013 pause, breathe, one with yoda \u2013 all right", "you\u2019re doing good", "thank you", "what advice would you give to people \u2013 would you recommend that everyone in this room try to have their own versions of curiosity conversations, and if so, what advice would you give them", "how can they cultivate that curiosity, broader awareness, and knowledge of the world", "i have a couple thoughts", "one is that i bet everybody in this audience is curious because i know the summit group, and you guys have gone out of your way to come here for the weekend, so i\u2019m assuming that you guys are curious", "the way to further refine it or use it the way i did \u2013 of course, i\u2019d recommend it because you gain\u2026you get the value of a different perspective that is outside of the definition of what you thought you were going to experience", "so, whether it\u2019s an architect \u2013 you think you know what an architect is \u2013 i thought i knew what an architect was", "i was wrong", "i met rem koolhaas, and the first thing he said is that architecture is like a living organism", "i would never have guessed that he\u2019d think of architecture on its base level as a living organism", "i can go through every one of my conversations where i was completely surprised, and it either shattered a prejudice or expanded a preconception", "absolutely, you should do it", "it sort of reaches right into the soul of humanity, which is an access point for all of us, i\u2019m sure", "at the very minimum, you\u2019re being really polite", "you\u2019re asking somebody \u2013 genuinely, with eye contact and caring, you\u2019re asking them, \u201cwhat are you doing", "how do you feel?\u201d you\u2019re getting into something that\u2019s kind of real, and the minute you\u2019re into some real place, it becomes a really powerful self-perpetuating force that leads to many other questions that are really edifying", "so, i definitely think you should do it, and the other thing i\u2019d add to support it is that you do have to do homework", "it takes a lot of case-building and preparation so that you\u2019re a good date", "my pledge was to always be a great date \u2013 the best date you ever had with a guy or a girl, whatever it is, i\u2019m going to be better than that with this one-on-one conversation", "i\u2019m going to keep it so they leave feeling like they got something out of it, too", "it has to be win-win, and it can always be win-win", "and, these conversations \u2013 oddly enough, each conversation was like each individual was like a dot living inside a greater constellation of dots, and i always had faith that they might connect someday, and i found that many of them do connect and form perspectives that are additive in storytelling", "storytelling is like a startup", "every one of these movies i\u2019ve made was nurtured from zero and was kind of a startup", "so, it all works together", "for people who are excited to actually give this a shot, who sit down, find an assistant\u2019s or publicist\u2019s contact information on imdb pro or wherever they happen to be searching \u2013 in the case of entertainment \u2013 do you have any advice for crafting the email", "what are some dos, don\u2019ts, or specific lines that you\u2019ve found very helpful", "well, you have to start with an insight about the person that\u2019s not dull, not generic", "if you\u2019re generic\u2026 i also teach the graduating class at usc \u2013 so, after six years, there\u2019s one final class, and it\u2019s now called \u201cstarting at zero.\u201d i\u2019m going to do one session where if you get the chance to have a 30-second contact \u2013 in a restaurant, at a basketball game, you see that person you want to meet \u2013 how to not blow it", "generic questions always blow it", "the other thing that always blows it is to ask for information that you could get yourself", "so, anything you can search for, you don\u2019t want to ask for", "if you see somebody, you never want to ask, \u201chow do i reach you?\u201d it\u2019s the worst thing", "you figure out how to reach them", "they don\u2019t want to stand there while you type out their email", "they just don\u2019t want to do that", "now, once again, in the email, you have to connect your interests with theirs and have an insight that lands in the middle", "you\u2019re going to say, \u201cgive me an example.\u201d it\u2019s really hard", "you know me too well", "all right, what are other ways to blow it, then", "are there other ways to blow it that you see a lot \u2013 or, now that you\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re getting pitched and people want to have conversations and meetings with you", "okay, i\u2019ll accept that", "sometimes, i\u2019ll give a speech or have a conversation, and people will go \u2013 no, i don\u2019t want to say it that way", "i will say no", "i\u2019ve learned to say no", "i don\u2019t like to say no because i\u2019m a pleaser, but i\u2019ve learned to say no because often, people just want to know the shortcut", "they might disguise the shortcut question, but they want the shortcut", "\u201chey, how do you be a producer?\u201d i hate that question", "i don\u2019t want to say \u201chate\u201d in this crowd, but\u2026 there are things that just aren\u2019t comfortable for me, like, \u201chey, there\u2019s no harm in asking.\u201d well, there is a harm in asking, but i think if you have an insight \u2013 you see the movie dunkirk", "you get a chance to meet the director for a second", "you don\u2019t want to say, \u201chow did you make dunkirk?\u201d you want to say \u2013 the best thing is if you saw it", "you can\u2019t pretend you saw it if you didn\u2019t", "and then, you have to say the unique trait about dunkirk, like the multiple perspectives of the characters that made it a subjective experience, or\u2026 i could just invent stuff right now, but i don\u2019t want to waste everybody\u2019s time", "you have to\u2026 what was the question", "the question was about other ways that people blow it, whether they\u2019re pitching to you or pitching to other people", "but, in tandem \u2013 we can come back to that, maybe", "well, i have a son who\u2019s just turning 18 years old, and i don\u2019t want him to blow it, but\u2026 a couple of months ago, he was thinking that he really wanted to go to tulane", "there were a bunch of schools that were on the list, but he was thinking about tulane", "so now, i\u2019m at aspen ideas festival, and we see walter isaacson, who i did the albert einstein series with, and i go, \u201coh, my god, you\u2019re going to meet walter isaacson, thomas", "not only is he this guy, but he is the key to tulane", "he\u2019s on the board.\u201d so, he meets walter isaacson just before we go onstage, and he says, \u201cmy name is thomas\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s a great kid, amazing kid", "he says, \u201chey,\u201d and they say hello, and i look away because i think things are going well", "he\u2019s looking on his iphone while walter isaacson is right there", "i don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good move", "you can\u2019t be on your iphone while you\u2019re trying to create connectivity", "that just doesn\u2019t work", "so, i say to him, \u201cyou\u2019re probably going to meet him again,\u201d and sure enough, he did", "i said, \u201cyou have to have three things in your pocket that you could say", "i don\u2019t care if you talk about gucci mane", "he\u2019s going to go, \u2018who\u2019s gucci mane?\u2019 you\u2019re going to go, \u2018he\u2019s trap.\u2019 he\u2019s going to go, \u2018what\u2019s trap?\u2019 then, you\u2019re going to say, \u2018it\u2019s mumble.\u2019 he\u2019s going to say, \u2018what\u2019s mumble?\u2019 \u2018it\u2019s trap.\u2019 so, you have to have something to say", "or, sporting \u2013 \u2018lebron got traded.\u2019 \u2018oh, did he?\u2019 you have to say something.\u201d how did the second conversation go", "oh", "the second conversation went better than the first, but there\u2019s still room for improvement", "whether in the early stages or now \u2013 anywhere in between \u2013 do you choose the people to have lunch with", "you have a nearly infinite choice and finite time", "how do you find the people or filter the people to select those you want to spend time with", "well, now, it\u2019s almost a self-perpetuating system, and people know i do this", "i have a trainer that works me out, and he goes, \u201cwow", "did you see william mcraven\u2019s commencement speech in texas?\u201d i go, \u201cno.\u201d and so, he shows it to me while i\u2019m on the elliptical, and i go, \u201cwell, i\u2019d better meet william mcraven.\u201d and then, i got to do that, and that was amazing", "how do i do it", "you go to blogs \u2013 you listen to podcasts in your case \u2013 and you go, \u201cwow, it\u2019d be hip to meet his person.\u201d i said that so casually", "there are so many ways to stimulate an interest to create a pool of possibilities i could also ask you about a specific person that i think you\u2019ve met, and i also have a related question with him", "edward teller", "how did you choose edward teller, or why", "so, edward teller was thought to be the father of the hydrogen bomb, and he was also creating the star wars program to protect the north american continent at the time of the reagan presidency, and that was through missiles, webs, and everything else", "i\u2019m just wondering if jeff bezos is in the room because i did have a chance to have a curiosity conversation with him about 16 years ago", "he blew my mind then, and i still get to be friends with him, and i know he\u2019s speaking, but he knows a lot about edward teller, much more than i do", "so, if you\u2019re here for that conversation, you might want to ask him", "but, i did put a lot of \u2013 \u201cbrian grazer told me to ask you\u2026\u201d no, no, no", "but, i know that he knows quite a bit", "so, edward teller took about two years to meet, and he said to me \u2013 it took about two years, and i met him with military security around me right outside of the lax private airport because he had a lot of army guys, and it nearly took a cavity search to have this conversation", "but, he really had no interest in me", "he had no interest in storytelling, and i asked him what was the last movie he\u2019d seen, and he brought up disney\u2019s animated film dumbo\u2026 not that it doesn\u2019t qualify as a movie, but it was quite a while ago", "so, he just wasn\u2019t really that interested, but i just kept going", "i remember ron howard and tom hanks \u2013 i had to go back to a meeting with them", "they go, \u201chow could you take it", "the dude totally insulted you.\u201d i go, \u201cyeah, it was kind of a bad experience, i guess, but i got a lot out of it.\u201d so, you can gain a lot from failure", "you learn a lot from failure", "i learned a lot from the failure of meeting isaac asimov, which also took a long time", "he\u2019s a preeminent writer of science fiction, and quite prolific, but i wasn\u2019t prepared well enough", "about 35 years ago, i got my little coach ticket to fly to meet isaac asimov, and it turns out his wife came \u2013 who was also actually his psychiatrist \u2013 and i was talking at the ritz-carlton bar with them, and we were all drinking non-alcoholic beverages, and she just looked at me and said, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d and so, they literally left after five minutes", "it didn\u2019t feel good", "it felt like a big waste of time, but it taught me to prepare", "i hope i\u2019m prepared for this", "i think you\u2019re more than prepared", "do you ever purposefully meet with people you know you will disagree with fundamentally", "yes, i purposely do", "why do you do that", "because it shakes me up and wakes me up", "also, if you\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 just a quick snap \u2013 the fog of war about mcnamara, that\u2019s the point of that", "you don\u2019t have to like him, but it humanizes him through ultimately entering his perspective as to how and why he was what he was", "so, i met daryl gates, who i knew i wasn\u2019t going to like", "he was one of the founders/creators of swat teams and forensics, and became the police chief of los angeles, and was right at the center of the rodney king riot, and eventually was quickly removed from office", "so, i do that, yes", "i\u2019ve met many cult leaders, leaders of very \u2013 i\u2019m not going to say their names \u2013 very intense cults", "what did you take away from those conversations", "well, cult leaders operate the same way a dictator does", "they\u2019re seductive, they\u2019re charming, they\u2019re cunning, they\u2019re intelligent, but they have a belief system that they\u2019re going to impregnate you with, and it\u2019s an interesting study to inhabit", "so, you mentioned very briefly \u2013 and, we don\u2019t have to spend a ton of time on it, but i wanted to open the door at least \u2013 eye contact", "yes", "could you please share some of your thoughts or beliefs related to eye contact", "yes", "so, i just finished writing a book called eye contact, but it\u2019s borne out of the world of curiosity, and i didn\u2019t even really\u2026 my appreciation for eye contact became alive kind of retrospectively", "the use of eye contact, the importance of eye contact \u2013 it\u2019s a tool that can\u2019t really be replicated through anything, and i don\u2019t think it can be through a.i", "it\u2019s a way to create intimacy and trust, and you learn so much through eye contact, and i didn\u2019t realize that it was so fundamental to all of my curiosity conversations", "but, it was only about a year ago that i had a waiter \u2013 i go to a restaurant all the time, and the waiter said to my wife, \u201cwow, i really like brian, but i didn\u2019t really think that he could know me well enough to like me because i didn\u2019t think he knew me,\u201d and he just said, \u201ci like him because every time he speaks to me, he looks at me directly in the eyes, and it makes me feel like a human being.\u201d i just thought about that", "i thought, \u201cwow, that\u2019s really true.\u201d i know that\u2019s not deeply profound, but i knew it was deeply profound to me, and i just kept thinking about that, and i thought about how that worked in every one of these \u2013 none of these curiosity conversations would have happened; they would have vaporized or melted down on the launch pad if i didn\u2019t have eye contact", "when you really have eye contact, and it\u2019s happening and coming to life, it is like a great date, and it\u2019s the best date", "through eye contact, it becomes deeply neurological, and it\u2019s very powerful, and i realized\u2026 and then, i thought back to myself, \u201cwell, when i was really amped up and everything, my partner ron howard\u201d \u2013 when writers would come in and meet with us just before our first movie, night shift, in 1982, he\u2019d say, \u201cyou don\u2019t really look at them in the eyes.\u201d i said, \u201cwell, i heard everything that they said, and i can repeat it back.\u201d he goes, \u201cyeah, but it\u2019s not respectful.\u201d and so, i changed it sort of temporarily, but then i lost touch, and i realized \u2013 i animated it once again", "i remembered when he said it to me, and it had a lot of impact", "once again, it resonated", "but, there are times where you shouldn\u2019t have eye contact, by the way", "in tribal cultures, you should look \u2013 because i\u2019ve owned houses in tribal cultures\u2026 you\u2019ve owned houses in tribal cultures well, i don\u2019t know \u2013 let\u2019s go to another question", "i actually just did not interrupt you", "please continue", "basically, i had a house on the north shore of oahu because i like to surf, and it\u2019s a little tribal there", "it\u2019s hierarchical in the tribal sense", "you\u2019re not supposed to look at people right in the eyes", "you look at them in the face to give them respect, and just divert your eyes a bit because that could produce a negative consequence", "so, pick your time and place", "you mentioned about when you were amped up, and i wanted to ask the question how did your hairstyle come to be", "as someone who no longer has hair, i\u2019m very curious", "well, it converges upon a couple of things", "one was that i was a pretty successful movie producer, and i wanted to have an identity because i saw four or five successful movie producers, and they all had facial hair, and i couldn\u2019t really grow facial hair", "so, their beards were helping define them a little bit, and i thought i couldn\u2019t do that", "there was one producer who liked to throw stuff at people, and i didn\u2019t really want to do that", "so, i was kind of at a loss with trying to create an impression beyond just being a producer, and then i was swimming in my swimming pool with my daughter \u2013 at the time, she was 6 \u2013 and i just popped my hair up, and she said, \u201ci love that!\u201d i thought, \u201creally", "so, we get out of the pool, and we go in, and i put some gel in my hair \u2013 not my gel, someone else\u2019s gel \u2013 and she goes, \u201cthat\u2019s awesome!\u201d and then, that\u2019s how it began", "and then, just to further that a little bit, i did it, and it was very polarizing", "a very small percentage of people thought, \u201chey, that\u2019s cool.\u201d maybe 20 percent", "80 percent thought, \u201cwhat a dick.\u201d i could see that they thought that, and sometimes, they said it", "i just thought, \u201cwow, it\u2019s polarizing, but yet, it reveals something", "it\u2019s like a litmus test.\u201d so then, i just kept going", "so, one of the many things that have really impressed me when looking back at your career is how persistently you have cultivated certain projects, and one in particular that i\u2019d like to ask you about is 8 mile", "could you tell us \u2013 and, i don\u2019t know the answer to this \u2013 how 8 mile came to be", "okay, sure", "what if i said no, i couldn\u2019t tell you", "no, i can tell the story", "so, i was dedicated to having curiosity conversations", "i should really know, but it was at least 20 years ago", "i was in new york in a taxicab, and the cab driver had on a local talk radio show, and ol\u2019 dirty bastard was being interviewed by this radio guy \u2013 more than 20 years ago", "so, i\u2019m going, \u201cwhoa, this guy is choosing to be called \u2018ol\u2019 dirty bastard.\u2019 that\u2019s his choice", "he wants to be called that.\u201d so, that was already interesting", "so now, i\u2019m listening to odb talk, and i\u2019m going, \u201cwow, this dude doesn\u2019t even make any sense.\u201d but, he was getting away with it and so committed to it, i was thinking, \u201ci want to meet him.\u201d so, i found a way to meet ol\u2019 dirty bastard \u2013 odb \u2013 and it was a trip", "everything cost money", "i met him \u2013 he said, \u201cmeet me at the studio,\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t let me in the studio", "i was on the sidewalk", "everything was like an a la carte thing", "if i wanted to go in, that would cost a little", "if i wanted to watch him do something, it would be a little extra", "it was bang, bang, bang \u2013 everything was a la carte", "so, i just chose to stay on the sidewalk", "it felt like that\u2019s what i should have done", "and, i just thought, \u201che is really interesting", "he\u2019s kind of funny, but he\u2019s also speaking some truth about what\u2019s going on in the inner city, what\u2019s going on on the east coast in this music genre that was early rap.\u201d so, i started thinking, \u201cwhat is early rap", "what\u2019s going on?\u201d so, that led me \u2013 from odb, i thought i would meet slick rick", "now, slick rick is really funny", "he\u2019s a british dude who wears a patch on his eye and has to be carried in like a king \u2013 \u201cslick rick, the ruler.\u201d so, slick rick the ruler is really funny, but also cool, and from that point, i met chuck d of public enemy, and that\u2019s another thing, and i\u2019m thinking, \u201cwow, this is a really important movement that\u2019s going on.\u201d while i was in new york \u2013 because i do these missions", "in 48 hours, i\u2019ll make a point to meet literally every magazine editor, and sometimes, newspaper editors", "so, i can say i\u2019ve met\u2026well, i\u2019ve met one of the more accomplished newspaper editors, frank rich", "frank rich was really credible, really smart, and very high-quality", "i said something to him \u2013 \u201ci met these guys\u201d \u2013 and he sort of dismissed it as an inferior subculture", "i said, \u201ci don\u2019t think it\u2019s a subculture, i think it\u2019s the culture.\u201d he sort of blew that off, and i thought, \u201ci\u2019m going to try to look at this kind of like an equation that i\u2019m going to prove in story form \u2013 try to bring some cinematic form to this equation and prove that hip hop is the pervasive culture, not a subculture, much less an inferior subculture.\u201d so, i went on this journey to try to do that \u2013 this learning journey that was more artists, more people, blah blah blah, and i wanted to capture the humor and the truth", "so, i\u2019m about eight years into this, and i\u2019m keeping it alive, and i\u2019m watching the vmas in new york when the vmas were super cool, and the camera pans, and i see this kid, eminem", "the camera sits on him, and he\u2019s got this icy urban glare, like, \u201ci\u2019m killing somebody.\u201d and then, all of a sudden, he becomes this fluid, self-effacing guy that smiles, and laughs, and is really elastic, and i\u2019m going, \u201cwow, what a range", "this is really interesting", "i want to meet that guy.\u201d so, then i go to my longtime friend jimmy iovine, who\u2019s one of the most important music producers ever, and is such a superstar for picking", "and, he goes, \u201cyeah, i can make it happen,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t easy to meet eminem", "he says, \u201ci can arrange it", "he\u2019s kind of a recluse, but i\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d this is before he really blew up and became a star", "so, he comes into my office in beverly hills, and he sits there like this, and he won\u2019t look at me", "i\u2019m over here, and i\u2019m talking and talking, and he won\u2019t talk back, and i\u2019m trying every little trick, and nothing is work", "it had to be 30 or 40 minutes into this, but it felt like three hours, and he goes, \u201ci\u2019m out.\u201d i\u2019m thinking, \u201cyou\u2019re out", "we didn\u2019t get to talk!\u201d so, i\u2019m thinking i have to beg him somehow; i have to find some way", "so, he\u2019s at the door, and i used some word like \u2013 i don\u2019t want to say it, but it was like, \u201ccome on, you can animate,\u201d or something like that, and he turned and looked at me again like, \u201cthis is not a good thing to happen to brian grazer right now.\u201d\u00a0 but then, he sat down, and one thing led to the next, and he told his story, which was an amazing story, which became the basis of 8 mile", "he was able to fully encapsulate what it was, and it was just a flashpoint moment where i was able to grab this, and he wasn\u2019t saying he wanted to star in it or anything, but i could tell this was it because it introduced what rap battles are, which is very cinematic, and it had a theme that i cared about", "all of my movies that i care about begin with a theme, not a story, because themes are not able to be challenged", "if love is a theme, it\u2019s hard to challenge that and say, \u201ci don\u2019t believe in love.\u201d or, in his case, that story was literally like, \u201chow is he going to get through these emotional injuries to become self-actualized enough to actually perform and be liberated from all of his emotional injuries, so he can look at the audience and say what he said at the end of the movie?\u201d, which i won\u2019t say in this audience", "so, i thought it was amazing, and we were able to get him to do the movie, and he ended up being the only rapper to ever win an academy award, and it was a great thing", "he\u2019s so talented", "so, just to follow up on a bookmark from that, what you said to him to get him not to leave was, \u201ccome on, you can animate,\u201d or something along those lines", "yeah, i don\u2019t really want to say \u2013 it was a little \u2013 you don\u2019t have to say", "\u2013 desperate like that, but i had to take my last shot", "he was at the door", "it seems to have worked out", "it worked", "it was partially antagonizing \u2013 i don\u2019t know what happened, but he talked", "he came back", "i have the utmost respect because i\u2019ve worked with so many actors, having produced somewhere around 100 movies, and he was the most professional", "he actually acted in every frame of the movie, wrote all of the music, and composed the music, and was a father", "he\u2019s just \u2013 i don\u2019t get to see him much, but i have the utmost respect for him", "so, we saw the sizzle reel earlier \u2013 oh", "that was a pregnant little comment \u2013 but, i think that we could talk about \u2013 and, we have \u2013 some of the successes", "do you have a favorite failure, meaning a failure that set up you up for later success, or something that was particularly helpful from the standpoint of learning", "well, i have a lot of failures", "fortunately, i\u2019ve had enough successes that it sticks out, but i do have a lot of failures, and they\u2019re different types of failures", "sometimes, when i violate my own rules and get lazy with my own rules about choice of a movie, where i get sloppy or lazy in the choices of building the foundation\u2026 any time you say \u2013 sometimes, i\u2019ve picked a director where i go, \u201che\u2019s good enough.\u201d you\u2019re making hundreds of decisions", "\u201cgood enough\u201d equals \u201cshitty.\u201d \u201cgood enough\u201d doesn\u2019t ever work", "i have one failure of \u2013 i produced apollo 13, and ron, tom, and i sort of became \u2013 we\u2019re friends and partners, and we all go, \u201cif we can just make this good, that\u2019s a win,\u201d and we\u2019re feeling so good about ourselves because we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re making something good that\u2019s not going to make very much money, but at least it\u2019ll be good", "why won\u2019t it make a lot of money", "because everybody knew the end of the movie", "they all lived", "so then, all of a sudden, we make the movie, and the movie does really well, and we\u2019re all really happy", "but then, the studio goes, \u201cdon\u2019t be too happy", "let\u2019s see how it does overseas.\u201d so, i\u2019m realizing, \u201cokay, now i\u2019m on this journey", "i thought i was happy, but now i\u2019m not happy", "no one\u2019s happy because it didn\u2019t get released overseas yet.\u201d so then, it gets released overseas and does really well", "we have a few more of these things", "\u201cwait until it gets to home video.\u201d then, all of a sudden, all the financial corridors are satisfied, and it does well", "then \u2013 i don\u2019t even think like this \u2013 now, the oscars are coming about, and they nominate", "there are five movies that get nominated, and apollo 13 gets nominated for best picture", "it gets nine oscar nominations and excludes ron howard, which was a super bummer for him", "no nuance there, it was just a bummer", "and then, for him, it was really terrible", "but now, we\u2019re in the oscar race, and everyone is saying, \u201capollo 13 is going to win 100 percent.\u201d las vegas odds makers \u2013 everybody is saying, \u201cyou\u2019re going to win", "what are you going to say?\u201d i go, \u201ci don\u2019t know what i\u2019m going to say", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m going to win", "i don\u2019t know anything", "i\u2019ve already been up and down like this the entire time.\u201d so now, what happens is it\u2019s the day of the oscars, and i\u2019ve got my speech right in my pocket, and i know i\u2019m going to be saying this speech because everybody said it, and in fact, some very famous investment bankers \u2013 one of them, who i didn\u2019t know, came to my office and said, \u201ci just want you to say a few words about my pancreatic cancer company,\u201d and i go, \u201ci can\u2019t think like this", "you\u2019re jinxing me", "this is too much pressure for me.\u201d and so, now, it\u2019s the day of the oscars", "i\u2019ve got my tuxedo on, i\u2019ve got the thing, and we\u2019re at the last award, and sidney poitier is going to open the envelope, and he\u2019s very dignified, and he\u2019s a very deliberate communicator", "he speaks\u2026slowly", "\u201cand, the winner is\u2026\u201d and, he\u2019s got the envelope in his hand", "he\u2019s ripping it open, and it looks like he\u2019s going to say, \u201cbrian.\u201d i\u2019m hypnotized", "i feel like a \u201cb\u201d is coming up", "so, i get up and i walk all \u2013 well, very close to him \u2013 i\u2019m up out of my seat, and he says, \u201cbraveheart!\u201d that\u2019s not \u201cbrian.\u201d that\u2019s a movie", "that\u2019s a whole other movie", "so, i have to turn around and walk back to my seat, and i walk backwards because i\u2019m so embarrassed, and i walk backwards, and there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s so vivid", "this got me taking sleeping pills because it was so\u2026 so, when i turned around, one chairman of one studio goes like this \u2013 \u201closer!\u201d \u2013 to me", "so, i\u2019m going, \u201coh, this is such a bad thing for me.\u201d and so, i sit down in a sweat, and the real astronaut that tom hanks played \u2013 jim lovell \u2013 is two seats down", "he reaches way over tom hanks and ron howard, grabs my wrist, and says, \u201ci never made it to the moon either.\u201d that\u2019s a hell of a story", "it\u2019s a long story", "oh, no", "one hell of a story \u2013 a good story", "it\u2019s a good hell, not bad hell", "did that have \u2013 actually, did it have a lasting impact, or were you able to brush it off", "oh", "so\u2026 okay, what did i learn", "what i learned was certainly not to treat anything as a reality until it becomes a reality, and that reality is a fluid experience, and that reality is always changing", "so, whatever data they were supporting didn\u2019t win", "so basically, always stay out in the middle lane", "i was pretty good at that, but i did fall out of the lane", "i thought, \u201cwell, i could win, i\u2019m going to win, i\u2019m going to go up.\u201d and then, eventually, i did win for a beautiful mind, so that was good, but because i was in the column of feeling like anything could happen, that it could all go wrong, i almost couldn\u2019t talk on that award", "i went up", "i was so nervous, and i had this piece of paper, and i was shaking with the paper, and i look at russell crowe and say to the audience, \u201ci know that my nervousness seems imperceptible.\u201d they thought that was kind of funny, but i noticed that all of the biggest female stars in the world were in the front rows \u2013 sandy bullock, nicole kidman, every one of them \u2013 and i\u2019d known a lot of them from meetings or working with them, and they were all looking at me like, \u201cyou can do this", "you can do it!\u201d they could tell i was crashing", "maybe it teaches you something about pre-anticipatory anxiety", "i don\u2019t know", "that sounds like a good answer", "yeah, it does", "you mentioned violating your rules for choosing films or working on projects, and one of the rules is that being good enough is shitty", "can you tell us about any of the other criteria that you have for selecting or choosing the movies", "i guess \u201cselecting\u201d and \u201cchoosing\u201d are the same thing; i\u2019m just trying to get fancy", "i start with a theme, and then i find a story that is compatible with that theme, that actually is a vehicle for that theme", "so, for a beautiful mind, i was just being present and looking around my world, and i would see people \u2013 kids \u2013 that were stigmatized by even the mildest mental disability, and i felt shitty about it", "you can see guys in this area talking into garbage cans, and they\u2019re not just talking into garbage cans, they\u2019re mostly living in an alternate reality, and that alternate narrative is the narrative of them talking into that garbage can", "it\u2019s not something to \u2013 you want to understand it so it\u2019s not cruel or stigmatizing, and it took a very long time to find a story that would be in service of that theme, but i did", "ultimately, i\u2019ve always said that i\u2019m in the feelings business", "as a storyteller, i\u2019m only in the feelings business because if you can ignite a feeling in cinematic form \u2013 which is an abbreviated way to connect right into your blood stream \u2013 then, you\u2019ve created an indelible experience for somebody that, if it has hope \u2013 i don\u2019t always win at this, but i try to make movies that have hope", "i don\u2019t like to put negative energy out in the world", "it doesn\u2019t have to be corny", "eminem\u2019s ending wasn\u2019t corny", "in friday night lights, they don\u2019t even win the game", "they just become more complete young men, and more mature, and stronger", "so, i think feelings are so central", "they\u2019re the differentiator, and if you lose track of that, i think you\u2019re really lost", "it\u2019s very important when you create any kind of story to create a protagonist that\u2019s suited for the population or the audience", "so, you really don\u2019t want to have a story that \u2013 i don\u2019t want to end on that", "what was that", "if you have a story that\u2019s designed to have emotional impact as an endpoint, which is my goal, you have to think to yourself, \u201cwhat is your audience?\u201d, and make sure that the characters that are personifying this idea are the same age or likeness as your audience", "sometimes, you forget that, and you go, \u201cwow, this is a young person\u2019s idea and i have older people as protagonists.\u201d that\u2019s often a calibration that is off", "i made a movie called fear", "fear starred mark wahlberg \u2013 commonly known as \u201cmarky mark\u201d at the time \u2013 and reese witherspoon", "and, it was based on \u2013 a lot of movies that matter to me are based on an experience like friday night lights, something emotional or real that i experienced and that i would be able to capture in the story, or something i\u2019m observing", "so, what happened is i have a daughter", "her name is sage, and she\u2019s the one with my hair", "so, this is prior to that", "she\u2019s 3 \u00bd years old, we\u2019re going skiing, she doesn\u2019t really know how to ski, we\u2019re in the chairlift, and i go, \u201cfollow me as we dismount.\u201d she goes, \u201cno, you follow me.\u201d i thought, \u201cthis is going to be a nightmare.\u201d at 3 \u00bd, she\u2019s saying i should follow her", "at 16, i\u2019ll be completely powerless", "so, i created a movie \u2013 this thriller called fear \u2013 starring mark wahlberg and reese witherspoon, where she picks this guy that is really charming, cool, and popular, but is really a psychopath", "but, the father is powerless and can\u2019t just go, \u201chey, your boyfriend is a psychopath.\u201d he has to say, \u201chey, are you really sure you want to go out with him?\u201d he has to really think it through, and so, that becomes this horrible nightmare film that is a very effective film", "unfortunately, i lived it through the parent\u2019s point of view as opposed to the kid\u2019s point of view", "so, it shows the points of view, but it\u2019s balanced through his perspective, and the stakes are in the 45-year-old man\u2019s brain", "if it were in the kid\u2019s brain, it would have made $150 million, but when i put it in the wrong perspective \u2013 even though it was an effective story personified through the parents \u2013 it didn\u2019t do very well at all", "it was a good movie, but it didn\u2019t have commercial results because it was a kid\u2019s story represented through adults", "so, you have to actually calibrate all these things and be very precise about it", "but, i can actually apply this to any one of your startups by associative parts in storytelling", "i\u2019m positive with that because i happen to believe everything is a story", "i\u2019m sure it\u2019s refutable, but i think that everything is a story, and when you lose track of your story where there\u2019s a company or human being, it creates a misdirection", "thank you for that", "you don\u2019t have to worry about the time", "i\u2019ll watch the time", "you mentioned \u201cgood enough\u201d equaling \u201cshitty,\u201d which i like a lot", "what separates a good enough producer \u2013 or even a good producer \u2013 from a great producer in features films", "taste", "just taste", "having the taste to pick the right subject, to pick the subject that is also authentic and hasn\u2019t either been inhabited at all or through this fresh perspective", "so, the taste in picking the right thing, the taste in executing, knowing what is good and not good", "it\u2019s completely qualitative", "what some people think is a good meal, another person might not think is a good meal", "there are some people who think that\u2019s a great car, and there are people that don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great car", "so, i would just think it\u2019s taste alignment and the ability to execute it", "so, when you build the foundational parts \u2013 whether it\u2019s your business or the business that i\u2019m in, which is making stories \u2013 you have to pick people with similar taste, and in testing that, i always go, \u201cwell, what does it look like?\u201d i want the person to say what they think the thing looks like, even if it\u2019s just a feeling", "so, i used to do this little trick where i could meet a director that has very good credentials of executing great taste, but he might not want to message the same thing that i want to message", "so, you really have to make sure\u2026 if i made a comedy \u2013 and, i did this many times \u2013 i produced a comedy, i got this a-plus director, and i would say, \u201cwell, what would it look like, ted?\u201d he starts talking, and he starts talking about wide shots", "well, i know that\u2019s not right because comedy is a close-up medium", "there are all these little giveaways that i\u2019m sure you guys will have that you can codify in your own manifesto", "so, it\u2019s a very doable thing to think through", "are there ways to cultivate taste", "i still make mistakes, by the way", "i\u2019m still very fallible", "as we all are \u2013 works in progress", "is taste something that you can cultivate", "are there ways to cultivate it, or is it more like height or something like that that\u2019s fixed", "no, i think you can develop taste", "you just have to go on a journey to do that", "i hadn\u2019t thought of it, but you would just have to be exposed to the execution of good taste in fashion, art, medicine, technology, or\u2026 some people see the \u00fcber-picture in the game, so you want to be exposed to those people", "why are you laughing", "i think it\u2019s a good answer", "it\u2019s not a mocking smile", "it\u2019s more of an \u201ci agree, thank you\u201d smile", "no, no, i\u2019m cool", "some people do", "they see things in an elevated way, and sometimes, they\u2019re accidents, but you should make it \u2013 i tried to make this always part of my journey, but\u2026 harold ramis \u2013 may he rest in peace \u2013 i adored him", "he wrote animal house and stripes, and i met him, and he had such an \u2013 i thought animal house was one of the funniest movies, but he had a really harvard brainy \u2013 i guess they don\u2019t always have to be aligned, but he had a very brainy way of stating what that movie was about, and i thought, \u201cwhoa, that\u2019s really heavy.\u201d and so, you know it when you hear it if you\u2019re available to hear it, but you can create a discipline where you try to sample stuff", "why is gucci good now", "because of its new creative director", "who picked him", "pinault picked him", "why did pinault pick him", "how does pinault pick directors", "how does that work", "you start going
