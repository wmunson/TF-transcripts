And I\u2019m speaking in hushed tones because I\u2019m in the airport and I don\u2019t like to yell and scream when in the airport, lest I get a boot on my head. So the guest, Mike Birbiglia; I\u2019ve wanted to interview Mike for years. You can find him on Twitter at Birbigs, B-I-R-N-I-G-S. He\u2019s one of the best known and busiest working comedians in the world, both behind and in front of the camera. His standup blends a lot of different elements; theater, film, storytelling and comedy. This is of interest to me because he\u2019s been very deliberate in studying different crafts and tying them together. This is reflected in his string of success which include sold out tours as a solo theater act \u2013 he just did 100 cities not too long ago \u2013 New York Times best-selling books, off Broadway shows, feature film, TV, and much more. In the last few years, his work has started to appear on This American Life, which is an incredible show and podcast, for those interested, where he began a meaningful collaboration with the host and producer, Ira Glass, who I\u2019d love to have on the podcast at some point. Currently, Mike is the creator, writer and star of the new film, Don\u2019t Think Twice, which is hilarious, heartrending, just a wonderful watch. I saw an early preview copy and it blew me away so I highly recommend it. I don\u2019t say that lightly. It\u2019s a great movie. If you\u2019ve struggled with notions of feeling like a failure, hoping for success, achieving some degree of success and then getting more or less than you bargained for, it\u2019s an incredible journey so I do recommend you check that out. And how the hell does he pull all of this stuff off? He seems to be juggling a million projects. I aim to find out. We dig into it. So, without further ado, please enjoy Mike Birbiglia. Mike, welcome to the show. Mike Birbiglia: Thanks, Tim. It\u2019s very exciting and timely for me to be here. I\u2019m digging into all of your stuff. I\u2019m immersing myself in it and it\u2019s affecting my life in real time. So speaking with you is almost a virtual reality experience. Tim Ferriss: I think this is a mutual feeling, since I\u2019ve been a consumer and fan of your comedy for so long. And I\u2019ve started thinking, after Elon Musk hints that we could be, logically speaking, players in some sophisticated future entity\u2019s video game that this might all be a virtual reality, albeit a very sophisticated one. But if I wanted to bring us back to the earth, at least as we understand it for a second, I pinged a number of mutual friends of ours, Brian Koppelman, of course, famed screenwriter, all around good guy; Chris Sacca, both of whom have been on the podcast before because they\u2019ve spent some time with you. I wanted to ask a number of things that they brought up. So the first was from Koppelman, and I asked very specifically, does he have any obsessions that you know of outside of comedy? And one word back: pizza. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s correct. Tim Ferriss: Can you elaborate on this, please? Mike Birbiglia: It\u2019s such an embarrassing obsession because it\u2019s simple; it\u2019s bread and cheese and sauce. Hearing you say that makes me realize how simple of a human being I am. I have a joke from my first album, Two Drink Mike, which is I love pizza so much I would marry it, but it would just be an elaborate ploy to eat her whole family at the reception. So stupid. But yeah, I love pizza. It\u2019s the simplicity of it. It\u2019s from my childhood. There\u2019s no deeper meaning other than by the time my mom raised me \u2013 that\u2019s Freudian, saying that, because I was raised by my mother and father, but my mother was around more often. She really kind of gave up on parenting and ordered pizza a lot. You know, she didn\u2019t want to cook that much and so she\u2019d just be like, \u201cLet\u2019s just order pizza.\u201d So we just got very used to it. Now, I figure in my adulthood I might as well be a connoisseur and have good pizza. Tim Ferriss: What now qualifies for you as good pizza? If you could have one type of pizza delivered to you, and I\u2019m sure there are many options but are you a deep dish? Are you a New York style thin crust? What are we talking? Mike Birbiglia: I think there are two kinds of people that I like most. One is New York thin crust, coal oven and places like Arturo\u2019s and Lucali and Luzzo. Then from my childhood just in Massachusetts, there\u2019s a ton of Greek pizza. There are all these sort of greasy, Greek pizzerias that I grew up on and so I have a fondness for that. It\u2019s like all through New England. So if I\u2019m driving to my parents\u2019 house, I\u2019ll stop in Connecticut at a pizzeria on the side of the road in a suburb; you can just get pizza. The other pit stop there is New Haven has extraordinary pizza, too. Tim Ferriss: Really? Never would have guessed in a million years. Is there something that characterizes Greek pizza, other than the fact that it\u2019s made by Greeks? Is it the same ingredients or do they do something? Mike Birbiglia: No, it\u2019s the same ingredients. It\u2019s a medium sized crust pizza. And there are a million theories on pizza. Most people say it\u2019s based on the water. There are books and books written about pizza but people say it\u2019s water based and that\u2019s what makes it good, which is why for whatever New York pizza is better, in my opinion, think about most places. The reason Koppelman is bringing that up is because I would have these readings from my film, Don\u2019t Think Twice at my house to workshop the film script the way that I workshop my standup. I would have people over like Frank Koppelman, Michael Webber, Phil Lord came to one, Nicole Haulsetter and I would always have the best pizza. I\u2019d have Lucali, or I\u2019d have Luzzo and I would say at the beginning of the reading, \u201cThe script might be bad but at the end, we\u2019re all going to eat pizza.\u201d Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like dealing with grade schoolers. Mike Birbiglia: It is like dealing with grade schoolers but it\u2019s a great incentive. I always urge screenwriters or anyone who needs feedback on their work to just invite people to something where you give them something; give them food, give them ice cream, give them pizza and try and solicit their feedback. Because feedback I think is the most valuable thing you can have for your writing. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s talk about two things, since they came up. The movie, first of all, I was very excited to get a sneak peek, I suppose \u2013 early access \u2013 Vimeo and I\u2019m only a half hour in but I\u2019ve loved it. I watched it actually with a friend and also a former podcast guest, Cal Fussman who wrote the What I Learned column, or a large portion of it for decades for Esquire. And we both, after watching the portion we watched because I had to jump on the phone to do this interview, No. 1 he said you should skip ahead to see the end so you can discuss it with Mike. And I said no, I want to watch the rest of the movie, the entire movie tonight. So I was very pleased and relieved that the movie is really, really good. I\u2019m going to digress here because that\u2019s my style but many moons ago I actually took one, and it was the only improv class, at this place called Beau Bonneau Casting in San Francisco. I remember it. It brought back memories and it made me want to go take improve classes as well as go see good improve. So Don\u2019t Think Twice, I would highly recommend people check it out and Sacca loves it, as well. Mike Birbiglia: And it gets better, by the way. Tim Ferriss: And it gets better. I\u2019m not even through Act One. Mike Birbiglia: It\u2019s nice that you haven\u2019t seen the whole thing because I can dance around things so that the listeners aren\u2019t spoiled on things. But yeah, it gets better. Tim Ferriss: One of the comments that came up from Cal \u2013 and I concur \u2013 was that the writing was really good. So I wanted to talk about the work shopping. What is the format? Could you explain how you workshop the material and at what stage do you workshop it? Mike Birbiglia: My first film was called Sleepwalk With Me. If people want to see it, it\u2019s on Netflix and it\u2019s easy to find. After I made it, I went back to improvising at UCB Theatre after years of taking time off from improv. I\u2019d studied it in college, etc. Tim Ferriss: UCB? Mike Birbiglia: Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles. The reason I went back to it was because I realized that so many of the principles that you see at the beginning of the movie and that you probably studied in your class say: yes, it\u2019s all about the group; don\u2019t think, just do. All those principles are really what got me through directing a film, which was the hardest thing \u2013 by far \u2013 I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life. After I directed it, I was like how the hell did I even live through that? How did I even stay alive? And I realized it was all these things that improv had taught me. So I veered back into doing improv. One night my wife, who is brilliant, came to one of my improve shows. She made this observation, and I thought it was wonderful. Because I think on that given night, guest improvisers sit in with me, a show called Mike Birbiglia\u2019s Dream, and any given week it will be Aidy Bryant from SNL, or Ellie Kemper from Kimmy Schmidt or Zach Woods from Silicon Valley. And my wife said, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing watching this art form with these people because it\u2019s all about the group and how everyone\u2019s equal, but in real life that person\u2019s a TV star, that person\u2019s a movie star and that person shares a one bedroom in Bushwick with five dudes who live on air mattresses.\u201d And I thought, man, that\u2019s not just a great observation; it\u2019s a whole movie. That is a whole movie to me. And I could just see the movie. I started just writing out this really kind of what I\u2019d call a throw up pass of the movie script. I would go to coffee shops in the morning. My minimum is three hours; I\u2019d stick myself in a coffee shop with no internet and no email, no anything. If it\u2019s going well, I go up to five hours and if it\u2019s not going well, I just end at three hours. Tim Ferriss: Sorry to interrupt. Do you have a time that you generally used for that? Mike Birbiglia: I try to do 7 a.m. I try to write before my inhibitions take hold of me. Because I\u2019m an actor, as well, I always say write in a trance and act in a trance. You don\u2019t want to even think consciously about what you\u2019re putting on the page for fear of oh, you wrote this down in your book. You write them as emails to people. And I think that\u2019s brilliant. That\u2019s in your book, right? Mike Birbiglia: It is, and just for people who don\u2019t have that context \u2013 or I might have talked about it in an interview, perhaps. I said I basically threw out the first few drafts of four or five chapters of The Four Hour Workweek because it was either too pompous or too slapstick. And then I decided to literally go into an email compose window and write the first chapter as if it were just a letter to a close friend after me having had two drinks; that was basically it, the approach. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s so brilliant. And a lot of times what I do is I\u2019ll write in my journal as though it will never be seen by anyone ever, and then more often than not the things that I put in my secret journal are the things that I publish. Tim Ferriss: And when you sit down at the coffee shop, 7 a.m. or just beforehand, a couple of things. Do you have a particular type of coffee or beverage, and then do you use Word? Mike Birbiglia: I do a cappuccino and I Movie Magic Screenwriter is the program I use, or I write in a notebook by hand. I try to write as much by hand in a nice notebook that has some meaning to me. Last summer I was on tour for the movie Trainwreck with Dave Attell and Amy Schumer, Vanessa Bayer and it was my birthday. Dave Attell got me a journal. It was really sweet. He just gave me a little gift for my birthday. We were in Seattle on tour and he gave me a nice journal. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s really nice. One of my favorite standup comics; never had any interaction with him but really amazing. Mike Birbiglia: Yeah, one of the greats. I asked him if he would sign it just on the back somewhere. So I have a Dave Attell notebook. Tim Ferriss: The signature series. Mike Birbiglia: I think of it as it\u2019s blessed. You know, like sometimes people ask me to sign their notebook, and I\u2019ll write, \u201cI bless these jokes.\u201d With my friends, you know Andrew Dost, who\u2019s a musician who\u2019s in the band \u201cFun,\u201d he came to see my off Broadway show, Thank God for Jokes. He actually brought me a journal as a gift. I asked him if he would sign it, and so he wrote this nice note. There\u2019s something about the personal element and the personal relationship with notebooks that I think can be helpful to the writer. Tim Ferriss: A couple of perhaps mundane questions but I\u2019m curious nonetheless; Movie Magic Screenwriter. Why do you use that instead of, say, Final Cut or something like that? Mike Birbiglia: It\u2019s so stupid. I\u2019m a real wonk with screenwriting. I listen to the Script Notes podcast with Craig Mason and John August, and those guys despise Final Cut; they just despise it \u2013 oh, I\u2019m sorry; Final Draft. Tim Ferriss: I always mix those up. I just incepted you with the wrong information, sorry. Yes, Final Draft. Mike Birbiglia: But anyway, a few years ago I stumbled across Movie Magic and I like it. There\u2019s no good reason, necessarily. And actually, this is a real quirk that I rarely admit to anyone, never mind in public. To finish the script I found that I kept putting it off and putting it off, and I was analyzing my habits. And I was like, I\u2019m putting off writing the script but I\u2019m not putting off having lunch with Brian Koppelman or having lunch with my brother or whatever. So I thought, I\u2019m always on time and I always show up to things so why don\u2019t I do that for myself? So what I did was I put a handwritten note next to my bed that said \u2013 and it has three exclamation points: \u201cMike!!! You have a meeting at Caf\u00e9 Pedlar\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s where I was writing \u2013 \u201cat 7 a.m. with your mind,\u201d which is so stupid. It\u2019 s so embarrassing to admit but it worked! Tim Ferriss: If it works, it works. Mike Birbiglia: Yes, if it works, it works. I was like, I have a meeting. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s with myself but it\u2019s a meeting and I have to be on time. Tim Ferriss: I love that. I love it that the human mind is such an odd amalgamation of sensical and nonsensical behaviors. I just love it. When you brain vomit\u2026 Mike Birbiglia: So I vomited the script out in a few weeks. Tim Ferriss: Is it scenes? Do you start with just stream of consciousness lines you want to include? Mike Birbiglia: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. It goes from stream of consciousness: I\u2019d like to see a scene of this, I\u2019d like to see a scene of this, I\u2019d like to hear this piece of dialogue. I corkboard my walls. It\u2019s silly when you see my office. It\u2019s just like a wall of corkboard. One of the three by fives I put up, I put up all of these mind writing slogans which you can look up, things like an Ezra Pound quote that I have on my wall that is literally three words. I think it\u2019s one of the best quotes for writing: \u201cOnly emotion endures.\u201d I always try to keep that in mind when I\u2019m writing because I think it\u2019s just a really crucial idea. Tim Ferriss: You said mind writing quotes? Mike Birbiglia: Yeah, mind writing quotes. You can do Googles for mind writing quotes, and it\u2019s like quotes from writers collected over time by famous writers. You look around and there are lines from Hemmingway, and lines from George Orwell and Jack Kerouac. It was funny because it was something that Elma Baker, who is a producer on This American Life actually gave me as a tip when I was writing my book, Sleepwalk With Me and Other Painfully True Stories. She said, \u201cWhen I wrote my book, I had all these mind writing slogans on the wall.\u201d I used it and I find it to be really, really helpful. Tim Ferriss: So only emotion endures, was that the quote? Mike Birbiglia: Only emotion endures. Tim Ferriss: What does that mean to you? Mike Birbiglia: A lot of times as a writer you get hung up on cultural references. If you see a comedian, a lot of times the way that I lose interest in comedians, for example, or sitcoms or movies or whatever, is they get hung up on a cultural reference; a joke about a cultural reference that literally will be gone in four years or five years. Like there\u2019s a reference to Twitter in my movie, Don\u2019t Think Twice. I was very cautious to think through the implications of in ten years when Twitter no longer exists, or becomes the MySpace of the future, will that reference make sense to the viewer and advance the story? Because you always have to think in those terms. There\u2019s a part of Sleepwalk With Me, the movie, where my character is figuring out how to drive to one of his gigs and he uses Google Maps. It\u2019s like a very key visual, and I had to think okay, what\u2019s going to be the mapping system of the future and will people be able to grasp what this mapping system is in relation to the story? In other words, if you get too hung up in making cultural jokes, about things that might go away, then that whole five minutes of the movie is sort of dead, in a way. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s at risk afirma when you have that topical hook. Mike Birbiglia: Yeah, and so with this movie, it was really what is this about? It\u2019s about friends. It\u2019s about a group of friends coping with what it\u2019s like to be in their 30s and confront the idea that they might not be successful the way they thought they were going to be successful in life, and what does that mean. What does that mean for their lives? What does it mean for their friendships? So whenever it would veer into something that was like a cultural reference, I\u2019d be like: no, let\u2019s pull it back to it\u2019s about friends. So that\u2019s what I mean by mind writing flow. Then I would have also on the wall things that felt like principles for the movie. When my wife made the observation of how everyone\u2019s equal on stage but off stage they\u2019re completely unequal, I wrote on the wall this thing I made up which is, \u201cArt is socialism but life is capitalism.\u201d And that was a guiding principle for the film. Tim Ferriss: I like that. Mike Birbiglia: How can that be a conflict between these friends? Tim Ferriss: You should add your own quote to the mind writing quotes collection. Mike Birbiglia: You know who bites me on that is Bernie supporters. They go: yeah, but it doesn\u2019t have to be! And I get their point. Tim Ferriss: At what point, then, do you invite your friends over and ply them with pizza? What form, like how rough is it when you give it to them? Mike Birbiglia: Probably about two months in. I started writing two years ago at the end of April. It was June 10th I had people over. So it was two months in draft and I had people over. And I\u2019d preface it. I\u2019d say it might not be good, and thanks for coming. I had ten or 12 of those at my house. They ended up being some of the most fun part of the process entirely. Because there\u2019s really no stakes to showing your friends your work. It feels like there\u2019s stakes; I was very nervous. But it\u2019s just there\u2019s something communal about it; something fun about it. Tim Ferriss: Do you do a table read? Do you have people take roles or do they all just read in silence and then give you feedback? How does it work. Mike Birbiglia: No, I have them read it aloud. I would have my assistant at the time, Greg, would read the screen directions and I would assign parts. I would highlight the scripts for people and then we\u2019d read it aloud. Then we\u2019d eat pizza, and we\u2019d just kind of talk about what it made us feel like. The director of my one person shows is this guy named Seth Barrow. He\u2019s a really brilliant theater director. He always does this thing dramaturgically. Tim Ferriss: Oh, good word! Mike Birbiglia: I will pitch him what I\u2019m working on, what my idea is or a piece of writing. I even did it this week because I was asked to write a piece for a storytelling piece at Nantucket Film Festival. I read it to him over the phone, and then he says back to me, well, what I get from that is this. And it\u2019s a nonjudgmental way of interfacing with a collaborator. So in other words, he reads the script and then he says, what I get from it is it\u2019s a group of friends and one of them ends up being more successful than the other. And then they\u2019re all trying to figure out what they\u2019re doing with their lives. So if he says that back to me and I think to myself: no, it\u2019s more than that; it\u2019s actually about this, this and this. And he says: well, that\u2019s not what I got from it. It\u2019s actually helpful to the process because I think one of the most important things about writing is that people are getting what you\u2019re intending. Like I listened to an interview with Ron Howard where he was talking about how he shows his movie to tons of test audiences so that they can tell him what the vision for the movie should be in the rough cut form. But it\u2019s to find out whether his vision is landing with people. And if it\u2019s not landing, then he\u2019s not conveying it correctly and he goes back and reworks it a lot. So that\u2019s how I like to think of the screenplay process. What I\u2019m doing essentially in my living room in my shabby apartment in Brooklyn is basically what they\u2019re doing on the $100 million level in Hollywood with tons more money, and fancier offices. It\u2019s quote-unquote development in Hollywood. They develop these screenplays for years and years and years, and it\u2019s all these executives giving notes. But I don\u2019t want executives to give notes to me; I want writers to give notes to me, and I want actors to give notes. I want collaborators who actually do the things that I like and who I aspire to be like. I invite people over who are way better writers than me. I have no business getting notes from Phil Lord, who\u2019s a director of 21 Jump Street and the Lego Movie; he just has a brilliant, brilliant mind. But who cares? I\u2019m just going to ask him to come. If he doesn\u2019t want to come, that\u2019s fine, too. Tim Ferriss: Do you generally go through, say, a five minute scene in its entirety and then people do a post mortem and give their thoughts? Or will they read a line and say: you know what, my character wouldn\u2019t say that; that\u2019s weird, it sounds stilted. How do you actually facilitate? Mike Birbiglia: We read it start to finish. So we read it like it\u2019s a table read for a sitcom or a movie. Then at the end, we just kind of adjourn and some fiery discussion starts. A lot of people give their thoughts, and they really conflict with other people\u2019s thoughts and those people fight with each other, and I listen to that. It\u2019s really helpful. Tim Ferriss: So you don\u2019t swear on stage, generally, as I understand it although Sacca said one or two funny exceptions, perhaps. Mike Birbiglia: True. And in the recent show, Thank God for Jokes, I actually dissect why I don\u2019t curse gratuitously on stage and why, in some ways in the Thank God for Jokes show, I departed from that a little bit. Which I can explain. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, please explain. Because for instance, I am an avid consumer of standup, love it. I\u2019ve heard, for instance, Dirty Jim Gaffigan. But he\u2019s largely sanitized but he can often pull it off. So what is your logic behind your approach? Mike Birbiglia: My logic started off in kind of an embarrassing way, which is to say that my parents were very upset that I was going to pursue comedy. My dad\u2019s a doctor and my mom\u2019s a nurse; those are professions where people help other people and are ashamed of their artistic children. My mom was so upset when I was moving to New York, and she said don\u2019t become one of those dirty comedians. And I said okay. She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to use those words to be funny. For example, Oprah\u2019s very funny.\u201d And I was like, \u201cMom, I\u2019m not sure you understand my goal. I\u2019m not trying to be the queen of daytime.\u201d But it stuck with me because you know, you want to make your parents happy. You want to pursue your goals but these people gave you everything and so you should heed that, to some extent. So I\u2019ve tried not to curse for a lot of years. But I do feel conflicted about that sometimes because a lot of comedians I admire most did curse on stage; Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor. And then some of them who famously don\u2019t curse are secretly criminals. That was a Bill Cosby reference. But yeah, so I\u2019m somewhere in between that. I will say I don\u2019t curse gratuitously more often as word choice than it is to sanitize it for people who object for Christian reasons about words. I curse quite a bit in my life, but when you\u2019re a writer, I think that word choice is important; I thin word variety is important. I don\u2019t know if you curse in the podcast\u2026 Tim Ferriss: I do occasionally but I try not to be egregious. Mike Birbiglia: If you say the F word 75 times in an hour, that\u2019s poor word choice. You\u2019re not being creative. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s lazy. It\u2019s like using the adjective \u201cinteresting\u201d as a modifier for [inaudible] [crosstalk]. Mike Birbiglia: Ah, yes. As a matter of fact, there\u2019s this brilliant film that calls out that point at the festival called Captain Fantastic, and it\u2019s coming out I think in September. Tim Ferriss: Is this with Viggo Mortensen? Mike Birbiglia: It is, yes. Tim Ferriss: A friend of mine saw a screener and said it was fantastic. Mike Birbiglia: It\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s a father who raises his family in the woods, like off the grid, so to speak, in Washington State. He won\u2019t let the kids say the word \u201cinteresting\u201d because it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It made me reconsider that as a word choice and try to banish it from my vocabulary. But the point is, I don\u2019t think the F word is effective as a monologue unless you\u2019re using it to the right effect, to the good effect. Tim Ferriss: For those who are interested in delving into the etymology and various uses of the word \u201cfuck,\u201d which is in fact very flexible, there is a book called English as a Second Fucking Language, that is a fantastic short read. I think it has a quote from Steven King \u2013 I might be making this up; don\u2019t sue me, Steven \u2013 on the front, or some huge name. Who do you run jokes by? Mike Birbiglia: I run them by primarily audiences. I go out and I bomb with jokes and see what lives. Also, my brother Joe. My brother Joe introduced me to comedy when I was a kid. He was a senior in high school and I was in eight or ninth grade, and I was helping him write these satire issues of the newspaper. So that was my introduction to comedy. He took me to see Steven Wright live, and that changed my life. That was when I was in high school and it just changed the way I thought about everything. It was an epiphany moment of I want to do that; that\u2019s what I can do. And I started writing in my notebook, and I wrote all these kind of Steven Wright rip-off jokes, really. Tim Ferriss: 24 hour banking? Who has time for that? Mike Birbiglia: Exactly, yeah. I went to a drive in movie in a cab. The movie cost me $95.00. They\u2019re just great. They\u2019re just endlessly great if people are interested in that type of joke. Another great joke writer in that vein is Mitch Hedberg, who I\u2019m sure people are familiar with. Tim Ferriss: So good. Mike Birbiglia: But anyway, once I saw Steven Wright, I was like, this is over; I\u2019m doing this. Then when I was in college, I entered a standup comedy contest and I won, so it got me a chance to perform at the DC Improv. Then I got a job working the door at the DC Improv. But the point is that my brother Joe and I always would kick around jokes, ever since I was 19 years old. And now he\u2019s worked for me, or he\u2019s worked with me. We\u2019ve run our production company for the last ten years together. I poached him from being an ad copy writer. Because he had gone sort of the route that my parents had wanted me to go, and I veered into comedy and then I sort of brought him along when I was able to financially do that. Tim Ferriss: Pulled him to the dark side. Mike Birbiglia: I pulled him to the dark side and yeah, he\u2019s an extraordinary writer so I run everything by him. But the big thing is also I run stuff by Ira Glass when we\u2019re working on something for This American Life. I run stuff by Seth Barrish when we\u2019re working on something for one of my One Person shows. And then my wife quite a bit, and then audiences. Audiences are the big determiner of what is worth saying. And when I say audiences, it doesn\u2019t have to be 2,000 people. Ten people at the Comedy Cellar at 2 in the morning, I can understand whether a bit is going to work for five years. Tim Ferriss: I love watching comedians work material, and I\u2019ve seen a number of them with notepads who are friends of mine working on material. They\u2019ll apologize after the fact, and I\u2019m like: no, are you kidding me? This is what I want to see. I can always see the finished product on HBO or wherever it ends up coming out. This is the in process stuff that I want to see. Mike Birbiglia: Me too; I love it. Tim Ferriss: So let me dig into some of the details and see if there\u2019s anything to discuss. So the process of eliciting feedback, when you pass something by someone, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s comedy and you\u2019re talking to Ira Glass or someone like that. Are there any particular questions that you ask? And the reason I bring that up is that when I have my friends who are writers proofread my writing, let\u2019s say for a book, I ask them first to highlight anything that is confusing or unclear. Mike Birbiglia: Oh, that\u2019s good. Tim Ferriss: Whether they love or hate something is secondary to clarity. As long as it\u2019s clear, they can hate it but I want them to understand what I\u2019m saying and then it kind of goes on from there. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s similar to the Ron Howard idea; is what I\u2019m creating being conveyed the way that I meant for it to be conveyed? Tim Ferriss: Right. So in your case, Ira is a brilliant man but not a comedian, s far as I can tell, although he has his moments of being funny, certainly. Mike Birbiglia: Oh, very funny, yes. Tim Ferriss: With someone like Ira, or anyone else, is there a particular way that you elicit feedback to make it as helpful as possible? Mike Birbiglia: Usually I will tell people bits and jokes over the phone, partly because they can sort of peacefully give feedback in a way that\u2019s not judgmental. When you\u2019re face to face with somebody, it consumer be hard to say a joke to them and have them feel the pressure of oh, I should laugh or I should politely respond. On the phone it\u2019s pretty easy to just kind of like skim through stuff and I can hear when people are interested by what\u2019s being said. Quentin Tarantino \u2013 I\u2019ve read this \u2013 will call people endlessly and pitch them movies that he\u2019s working on. He says he doesn\u2019t even have to hear the laughter; he can hear in their silence what their interest level is. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like the silence whisperer. Mike Birbiglia: Exactly. There\u2019s some truth to that. If you pitch stuff to people all the time, after awhile you kind of get the sense of are they hooked or are they not? If they\u2019re not hooked, you should consider another direction. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, definitely. Tarantino is a fascinating case. I\u2019m hoping to have him on the podcast sometime in the next six to 12 months, which I think could happen. This is a very broad question. Why did you make it, so to speak, in a business where very few people do? You\u2019ve reached a level of success across several different art forms, but let\u2019s just look at comedy and the various iterations of that. What were the decisions you made, or chance encounters or mentors, or whatever it might be that contributed it to you making it, at least that being the perception, certainly? Mike Birbiglia: When I was 19, I had a bladder tumor. They caught it early. It was a malignant tumor so every three months for the next five years, I would have to go for a cystoscopy where they would look inside my bladder and see if the cancer had returned. And it didn\u2019t. I was very, very lucky. It\u2019s like almost 20 years later and I go for a cystoscopy now every two years ago. But at the exact, same time that I had this kind of life threatening ailment happen, I started to do comedy. I entered a contest, and I won and I got this job at the DC Improv. And I would watch every comedian who would come through the DC Improve. The variety, actually, was really helpful. I saw Larry the Cable Guy before he was a stadium act. I saw Dave Chappelle before he was The Chappelle Show, and George Lopez and Margaret Cho, Kathleen Madigan, Brian Regan, Jake Johannsen, Jim Gaffney and all these people. I watched all of them and I would try to just bug them with questions. So I had this kind of education in watching a ton of comedy and going to open mikes and trying comedy at the exact, same time where I had this realization from cancer that life is short and can end, and it can end at any time. And it is, in some ways, the best thing that ever happened to me was that perspective because I became an absolute workaholic, trying to get good fast. I wanted to become a really great standup comedian really fast. So I feel like that\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s this comedian, Tommy Johnagin who started in the Midwest, and I remember he opened for me one time when he was in college. Now he\u2019s been on Letterman a lot of times and he\u2019s got a great career. But when he opened for me when he was in college, he had done standup once or twice. He quoted this back to me years later. He goes, \u201cYou gave me this piece of advice the moment I started, and it\u2019s helped me create what I\u2019ve created as a career. Which is if you want to perform five minutes of comedy, write what you think is three hours of great comedy.\u201d Because that\u2019s the ratio that it\u2019s going to be. You\u2019re going to write about three hours of what you think is great, and about five minutes of that is worth showing an audience. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good quote. I remember reading at some point, I don\u2019t recall who it was. I want to say Neil Gaimon but that\u2019s just because I have a secret infatuation \u2013 not so secret infatuation with Neil Gaimon. So this is something helpful that I want to attribute to him somehow. Which was a writer talking about process and discussing the frustration of, say, writing nine or ten pages and only having one or two paragraphs at the end be worthwhile, and feeling like the first nine pages were a waste of time but then emphasizing now, in fact, you needed those first nine pages so that you could produce the two paragraphs that are of use. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s a brilliant way of looking at it. Not only that, everything that you do in your life, I\u2019ve realized over the years, is leading to where you are. So in other words, the fact that in college I worked at the door of DC Improve and brought food to people\u2019s tables, and I was a waiter at the Toombs when I was in college, and then I was a temp in New York City at a pharmaceutical company. All of that actually led to the life experience that would be able to put something on the page that feels real. I went to a little talk at the Nantucket Film Fest this morning with Oliver Stone. The thing I wrote down in my notebook from it, my takeaway, was when he was 20 years old, he wrote I think a novel and it got rejected all over New York City, every publisher for two years. He tried to get it published for two years. Then he joined the Army. When he got out of the Army, because of the GI bill he was able to go to film school and he made films. What he talks about is it was the Army that taught him to become self reliant in a way that allowed him to understand how to make films. He says, \u201cThe Army is what took me out of my head and made my understand that it\u2019s not about being just cerebral; it\u2019s about a combination of cerebral and self reliant and being able to survive in the forest or whatever it is.\u201d And that\u2019s what went into this epic film career that Oliver Stone has had. And I think that\u2019s worth considering in this discussion. Tim Ferriss: So given that, which I agree with \u2013 and how old are you now, Mike, if you don\u2019t mind me asking? Mike Birbiglia: I just turned 38 this week. Tim Ferriss: Happy birthday. Mike Birbiglia: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: If you were going to give advice, or could give advice to your 20-year-old self, 25 or 30, so you can pick, if you could place us in what you were doing, where you were; what advice would you give to yourself, if any? Mike Birbiglia: I would say write everything down because it\u2019s all very fleeting. I would say keep a journal, which I have but I would have been more meticulous. And then I would say don\u2019t bow to the gatekeepers at the head of, in my case, show business but at the gate of any business or any endeavor. Don\u2019t bow to the gatekeepers because I think in essence, there are no gatekeepers. I think that you are the gatekeeper. Tim Ferriss: I like that. It has a vaguely Ghostbusters ring to it, also. Mike Birbiglia: But it\u2019s bizarrely true now in history when we look at where we are in film and television and the internet. There\u2019s this amazing quote, I think it\u2019s at the end of Hearts of Darkness, which is the documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now. I think it\u2019s in the end credits, or it\u2019s one of the final things Francis Ford Coppola I\u2019m pretty sure in the \u201870s said that the best movies in the future, because of the way that technology is moving, the best movies are going to be made by a kid \u2013 just from memory \u2013 a kid in Ohio who picks up a camera and starts shooting something. Technology is going to be democratized, and has been, now, in a way that\u2019s unprecedented for film, certainly. Tim Ferriss: Oh, across the board. You have kids who are programming and piecing together autonomous cars in their garages. It\u2019s really unbelievable. Although, as the technology or despite the technological changes, much like the quote on your wall, \u201cemotions endure,\u201d the core components of good storytelling I don\u2019t think are going to change all that much. Mike Birbiglia: No, no. And as a matter of fact, I would say the same thing for my 20-year-old self; don\u2019t waste your time on marketing, just try to get better. Tim Ferriss: Yes, great advice. I remember a blogger very early on, I think it was Robert Skogle, actually, said to me, \u201cGood content is the best SEO.\u201d So kind of the equivalent of writing online, which everybody is trying to optimize for search engine results and he\u2019s like, \u201cJust put out good content. People will link to it and that is how you get found.\u201d Mike Birbiglia: Yes. And also it\u2019s not about being good; it\u2019s about being great. Because what I find, the older I get, is that a lot of people are good and a lot of people are smart, and a lot of people are clever. But not a lot of people give you their soul when they perform. Tim Ferriss: Yes, very, very true. So when you think of the word successful, who\u2019s the first person who comes to mind and why? Mike Birbiglia: I\u2019ll say a political and nonpolitical answer because if people dislike this person, then it kind of goes in one ear and out the other: Barack Obama. Barack Obama to me is very inspiring. He came from nothing. He\u2019s president of the United States. I feel lost on culture, a lot of times. He doesn\u2019t have to be. Like he doesn\u2019t have to be the president. He could be an extremely wealthy anything. Like on Wall Street, he could be a corporate lawyer. He could be in Silicon Valley. He could do anything that would make a person billions of dollars, and he chose to work in service of the country. I met him at the 75th anniversary of the USO last month, which was really cool. But then I met him two years ago when my wife was pregnant. Our whole thing was whenever we meet someone who we know doesn\u2019t care about meeting us, my wife and I always try and come up with a trick question that throws them off and they kind of like have to answer or have to think about it. I give this advice to people. If you ever see Jimmy Fallon on the street, don\u2019t be like: I love The Tonight Show. Just be like: what do you think of kiwi? And he won\u2019t be able to not be like, I love kiwi. Like just talk to people about a think they didn\u2019t think they were going to talk about. And then next thing you know, you\u2019re talking to Jimmy Fallon about kiwi and then you\u2019ll have that for your life. So our thing with Obama was let\u2019s tell him, because my wife was four months pregnant but we hadn\u2019t told anybody yet, was why don\u2019t we tell him you\u2019re pregnant? And so when we get to the front, I go, \u201cMr. President, this is my wife, Jen. She\u2019s newly pregnant but don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d And he couldn\u2019t help it. The president of the United States couldn\u2019t help but be like, \u201cWell, am in first to know?\u201d And my wife say yes. She goes, \u201cDo you have any parenting advice?\u201d And he goes, \u201cWell, get some sleep.\u201d And we\u2019re like, ha-ha because he\u2019s the president. You know, it wasn\u2019t that funny comically but he\u2019s like your boss times a million. But then he got better because he goes, \u201cNo, actually, I got something.\u201d He goes, \u201cWhen you bring him home, the poo\u2026\u201d The president said poo. And the moment he said poo, I thought, this is the greatest day of my life. Like I could die right now and I\u2019d be fine. He goes, \u201cWhen you bring him home, the poo doesn\u2019t smell. It doesn\u2019t smell like adult poo. Adult poo smells bad.\u201d And then he looked at me for affirmation, and I was like, \u201cAbsolutely, Mr. President; adult poo does indeed smell terrible. Thank you for inviting me to the Poo Seminar 2015.\u201d And he goes, \u201cAnd when you bring him home, babies crave structure; in their eating and in their sleeping.\u201d And he goes, \u201cAnd breastfeeding doesn\u2019t always work out right away. There\u2019s going to be a little bit of wonky. Don\u2019t freak out. And if it doesn\u2019t work out, the sleeping, right away; don\u2019t freak out.\u201d And he paused and he thought about it and he goes, \u201cThat\u2019s actually some pretty good advice.\u201d He complimented his own advice. But I\u2019m telling you, the best thing to do is you\u2019ve got to get people questions they don\u2019t \u2013 and you\u2019re doing it right now \u2013 you\u2019ve got to give people questions they\u2019re not expecting. And then my nonpolitical answer, people hate Obama, I get it, whatever; you\u2019re a Republican, I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s your issue. But it would be Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan is the great artist of our time because, unlike the Rolling Stones or the Beatles who obviously broke up and some of them have died, but he continues to grow and learn and produce and to change. Time Out Of Mind is a top five Bob Dylan album of all time, and he made it in his 60s. It\u2019s unbelievable. He made Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan when he was 21 years old. It\u2019s unbelievable. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, when you\u2019ve been doing it for three or four decades, you\u2019ve definitely passed the once you\u2019re lucky, twice you\u2019re good stage. Mike Birbiglia: Yes. Tim Ferriss: The next question, I feel like, has to be out of left field for this to function after that incredible Obama story. So let me try a question that I\u2019ve been dying to ask someone but I feel like you might be game for this. What are your rules for good sex? Mike Birbiglia: Oh wow, that is fascinating. Captain Fantastic has this piece of advice in it which I thought was smart, where the father says to the son, \u201cWhen you make love to a woman, be gentle and listen.\u201d And I think that\u2019s wise; I think that\u2019s good advice I think you should have sex, assuming your wife or girlfriend wants this, more than you think you should. Because it\u2019s kind of like pizza; it\u2019s never a bad idea. Tim Ferriss: You could even add that to the list of your incentives when they\u2019re proofreading, I guess. And the script might not be good but at the end, we\u2019re all going to have sex. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s right. Oh, my God, if that\u2019s the qualification for the next reading series, that will get so many people in the door. I had a joke on my first album, which is, \u201cPizza\u2019s like sex; when it\u2019s good it\u2019s good, when it\u2019s bad it gets on your shirt.\u201d It\u2019s honestly the dumbest joke but I still enjoy saying it. Tim Ferriss: Is there a book or books that you\u2019ve given frequently as gifts? Mike Birbiglia: I give a book sometimes, but more often I give a DVD of Stop Making Sense. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not familiar with that. Mike Birbiglia: It is the David Byrne concert film with the Talking Heads that Jonathan Demi directed, I think, in the early \u201880s. And it\u2019s just a really innovative, strange concert film that\u2019s very much worth watching and taking in in a creative sense because it\u2019s so unorthodox. It\u2019s called Stop Making Sense and musically, it pays off and I think visually it pays off because it\u2019s very abstract. That\u2019s the one thing I give. The other thing is people ask me about my sleepwalking all the time because I have obviously a very serious sleep disorder; it almost killed me. So I give this book called The Promise of Sleep, and it was written by Dr. William C. Dement, who is the father of sleep medicine in this decade or even century. He makes a cameo in my movie, Sleepwalk With Me, as himself. But it\u2019s a wonderful book. People often say to me, because of my sleep disorder, what should I do, I have insomnia, blah, blah, blah. I always say first of all, get this book and second of all the basic takeaway for starters is an hour or two before bed, turn off your phone, turn off your computer and I forget what the third one is. But that\u2019s the biggest thing. Think of sleep as something you don\u2019t crash into but that you ease into, that you\u2019re parking the car as opposed to crashing the car in the parking space. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good point. I like that analogy. Any other favorite movies or documentaries? Mike Birbiglia: I love Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News are two James L. Brooks films that I can just watch over and over and over again. I made Don\u2019t Think Twice and I made Sleepwalk With Me and when I make hopefully the next eight or nine movies, I strive to make movies like those where you\u2019re laughing and you\u2019re crying. Because to me, that\u2019s what all of it is for; it\u2019s to experience the range of emotions within an hour and a half or two hours. Tim Ferriss: On that point, if you could combine three comedians, alive or dead, into one super comedian, who would you pick? Mike Birbiglia: Okay, it would go something like this. I\u2019m writing this down on a pad. It would go Mitch Hedberg, Doug Stanhope, Maria Bamford. So Mitch Hedberg I think is the greatest joke writer of our time. I think Doug Stanhope is the most honest comedian of our time, and I think Maria Bamford is the most vocally and physically versatile. Tim Ferriss: Unbelievable. Mike Birbiglia: I just think what she does is uncanny. She drops into these voices that are just these completely vivid, pitch perfect impressions of people in her life and it\u2019s uncanny. So I would say those three. That\u2019s a great question, by the way. I\u2019ve never gotten that question. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to have to dig in. I know Hedberg, I know Maria Bamford; I haven\u2019t explored Doug Stanhope. Is there any particular work? Mike Birbiglia: There\u2019s one called No Refunds that\u2019s on Netflix. All of his stuff is meant to make people leave. So all of the names of his albums are things that imply that you can\u2019t get your money back, essentially. Tim Ferriss: Does that meant hat he does what, as I understand it and I\u2019ve listened to and watched a fair amount of his stuff, but Bill Burr? It seems that Bill Burr will deliberately lose the audiences because it\u2019s no longer a challenge to simply make them laugh; he wants to be able to reel them back in. Is that effectively what Doug does? Mike Birbiglia: Yeah, it\u2019s precisely that. Seeing Doug Stanhope live is Bill Burr actually to the extreme. It\u2019s like a magic trick. It\u2019s like watching Andy Kaufman doing his bit where he does his Latka character, speaking the gibberish to the audience and bombing, and people not realizing it\u2019s a character and then going into a pitch perfect Elvis impersonation and people go crazy. It\u2019s this thing where you can\u2019t believe that he lands the show after how terrible he made it. It\u2019s fascinating. And Bill Burr is incredible, too. Bill Burr may be very close to that list, as well. Tim Ferriss: Maria, I\u2019ve listened to a lot of her comedy and although I alternatively love and hate this description in the self help business, which I try not to think about much but I get asked about The Secret a lot, and manifesting things which is not really a focus of mine, at all. But Maria has this hilarious bit that I always mention. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou should listen to Maria Bamford; she talks about The Secret.\u201d And there\u2019s this bit where she\u2019s talking about being down and out, and her sister is very successful, corporate, super efficient. Maria has her over at one point, and Maria has put together a vision board and there\u2019s a microwave on the board. And her sister goes, \u201cA microwave? Really? You want a bucking microwave? That\u2019s depressing. I\u2019ll buy you a microwave.\u201d And then Maria\u2019s like, \u201cBam! A manifest!\u201d It\u2019s like oh, my God, so genius. What purchase comes to mind \u2013 could be recent or whatever \u2013 that has positively impacted your life? Ideally not like a Maserati but something that\u2019s on the less expensive side. Mike Birbiglia: This sounds so stupid and current, and speaking of things not enduring \u2013 who knows what this will even be, but I find the Fitbit was helpful for me. Because it tracks my sleep. And so it tells me this thing about my sleep. Tim Ferriss: It tells you how much you were walking the night before? Mike Birbiglia: No, it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know if you know about this but it not only tells you how long you\u2019ve slept but it tells you the quality of sleep. In other words, it tells you you\u2019ve slept technically for eight hours but you were awake for an hour of that. So it\u2019s actually quite helpful. Tim Ferriss: I like it. So you use it primarily for your sleep, then? Mike Birbiglia: For my sleep, yeah. I like trying to get to 10,000 steps a day; that\u2019s helpful. But for the sleep, you\u2019ve got to remember I have slept over at hospitals countless times for sleep studies because I have REM behavior disorder. It\u2019s like $3,000 per visit. Some of it is insurance but some of it I have to pay. This thing basically does a sleep study and it costs $100. Tim Ferriss: What type of nighttime rituals do you have? You mentioned easing in instead of crashing into the wall. Do you have any particular wind down or evening rituals? Mike Birbiglia: There\u2019s actually a good podcast called \u2013 not to be mistaken with Sleepwalk With Me, there\u2019s a good podcast called \u201cSleep With Me.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That could go a lot of directions, okay. Mike Birbiglia: Yes. It\u2019s this guy, he calls himself Scooter. Tim Ferriss: Sounds trustworthy. Mike Birbiglia: He has this really uncanny skill of talking in circles and slow, and circling back to the first topic and then the next topic, and another thing, and a digression, and then the next thing you know, you\u2019re asleep. It\u2019s pretty fascinating, what he does. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll have to try that. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s worth looking into. And then I try to write in my journal. Honestly, the biggest thing is getting off of social media. Getting off of Twitter and Facebook. In relationship to what we were talking about earlier when I was saying the thing about Oliver Stone, that he joined the Army and that\u2019s how he became self reliant. And how ultimately, everything in your life you do leads to who you are and what you\u2019re able to accomplish. I think that social media is weirdly the exception to that. I think that social media is this weird kind of looking in the mirror all the time thing. It\u2019s not helpful for being productive or learning. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true but that\u2019s been my feeling lately. Tim Ferriss: I think the dose makes the poison, certainly. There\u2019s a point where you\u2019re like: oh, this Tylenol is helping my headache. And then: oh, my stomach lining just fell out of my ass. Mike Birbiglia: Has that actually happened? Tim Ferriss: That hasn\u2019t actually literally happened to me but there\u2019s definitely a point where things in excess become their opposite. On the flipside, what does the first 60 to 120 minutes of your day look like? Are there any particular rituals that you have in the morning? Mike Birbiglia: It\u2019s a little bit like Memento every day. Tim Ferriss: Injecting your wife with insulin over and over again? Mike Birbiglia: Just like a lot of times if I\u2019m not focused, I will kind of wander. Until I have coffee, forget about it. I\u2019m a heavy coffee drinker. Basically if I\u2019m on a project, if I\u2019m shooting a movie, I have a complete and exact plan for the next day. If I\u2019m writing a movie, like I said, I put notes next to my bed: Mike, wake up; go to the coffee shop and write. I think that when I don\u2019t have a routine, I\u2019m a mess and I\u2019m not productive and it\u2019s not helpful. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d say; it\u2019s inconsistent. The other thing is I travel. The Thank God for Jokes show, I toured 100 cities in a year. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Mike Birbiglia: It\u2019s very hard to have rituals when you\u2019re going to 100 cities in a year. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wonder if it makes the values of the rituals even greater if you are able to maintain some semblance of a routine when touring? I don\u2019t know; I\u2019ve never done that. Do you have a favorite venue in the entire United States, if you had to pick one? Mike Birbiglia: Gosh, there are so many. The Upper Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City feels like home because I\u2019ve been on that stage a lot, and the Comedy Cellar in New York feels similarly. I think that in terms of a pound for pound venue, I think the Chicago Theater is probably your best concert venue in America. The Chicago Theater seats about 3,000 people. And yet, as a performer, you feel like you\u2019re talking to people in your living room. And as an audience member, it feels like you\u2019re just watching someone not in your living room but it feels intimate. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re a collector of good advice. What is the worst advice that you hear or see being given out often? And that could be in any domain; it could be comedy, it could be writing, it could be movies, it could be completely unrelated, anything. Mike Birbiglia: It\u2019s all about getting your dream, pursuing your dream. I don\u2019t know what the exact advice is that drives me crazy but I think there\u2019s a cultural thing right now that is kind of irksome. I read it recently in the New York Times where someone said \u2013 I\u2019m forgetting who wrote this but she said, \u201cIf I advice for college students, it would be don\u2019t ask what do I want to be when I grow up; ask how can I help or how can I change the world, or how can I be of service to other people.\u201d I think the kind of just be whatever you want to be is perhaps to be reconsidered by how can I be of service when I\u2019m on the earth for such a short amount of time. Because when I do my One Man shows, for example, Seth Barrish and I, we\u2019re always talking about how is this story that I\u2019m telling, let\u2019s say Sleepwalk With Me, it\u2019s a story about how I jumped out a second story window while sleepwalking and it nearly killed me. I got cut up, I ended up in the emergency room. I jumped through a window and the glass missed my femoral artery by a centimeter. And ultimately, we had to figure out not how is this story about me, but how is it about the audience. And the way we discovered it was about the audience was that it\u2019s about the catharsis you can experience by sharing something that you\u2019re very embarrassed about; in my case having this life threatening sleep disorder that I was embarrassed about. I thought people would think I\u2019m crazy. It\u2019s about the catharsis of opening up and telling people about that, and how that can make us feel closer to one another. And so in that sense, this is a round about way of saying how can what I\u2019m doing be helpful to the audience? How can they go away feeling empowered in their life as opposed to: oh, that was funny. Because walking away going, oh that was funny, I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s something about it that feels like it\u2019s a missed opportunity. Tim Ferriss: I remember speaking to John Favreau on the podcast about his writing and humor. I\u2019m paraphrasing here but he said: I don\u2019t aim for funny; I aim for truth and then the funny often comes along with it. Mike Birbiglia: I think that\u2019s absolutely true. Tim Ferriss: On this point of what you can offer for service, Brian Koppelman mentioned something in our text exchange which was he, meaning you, chooses to be kind. It\u2019s a conscious part of who he is and I\u2019m always interested in how he consistently thinks about other people in whatever engagement. And how going through life that way makes him feel. Can you confirm or deny or elaborate on that? Because I think it\u2019s an observation worth exploring. If that is a decision you make, has it always been the case? Is it something you came to a particular way? Mike Birbiglia: I think that\u2019s from my mother. My mother is a very generous person. She\u2019s been a nurse for her whole career, and then she was an elementary school nurse for awhile. She\u2019s very Catholic, which is not something that I followed in her footsteps with. Yes, she\u2019s just very sweet to everyone. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true; it\u2019s nice to hear that someone says that about me. But yes, I try to be nice to everyone. I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think that peace on Earth is achieved in a micro sense. Peace is achieved through every person who you meet in your day. It\u2019s an opportunity to contribute to peace everywhere. Maybe it\u2019s na\u00efve but that\u2019s how I think of it. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s na\u00efve. I think the macros is made up of the micro. I remember this story I heard, I believe it was from a professor at Stanford named B.J. Fogg who decided to teach a class, as professors at Stanford are allowed to do, that he effectively made up out of thin air. And I think it was creating world peace, or something like that. He had no idea what the syllabus or the curriculum would be whatsoever. And then 30 students show up, and he tries to figure out what the class is. He had students from, say, Israel, Palestine, all over the place and he quickly realized no one could even agree on what world peace went. Like what does world peace look like? So he said okay, since we can\u2019t agree on world peace \u2013 and this was the interesting part \u2013 he said, \u201cLet us try to agree on what the antecedents to world peace would be.\u201d Mike Birbiglia: Oh, that\u2019s smart. Tim Ferriss: What are the constituent parts that might make up world peace? Let\u2019s start to agree on some of the ingredients. Then he had them work on projects focused on those common ingredients. And I do feel like to take something like peace and make it actionable, by necessity you\u2019re going to bring it down to the micro. Otherwise, it\u2019s just not actionable; it\u2019s too abstract. Mike Birbiglia: By the way, I\u2019m fearing as I\u2019m saying this that someone is listening to this going: \u201cI met Mike Birbiglia and he\u2019s an asshole.\u201d I have that with Q&As, like a lot of times touring with Don\u2019t Think Twice, we\u2019ll do Q&As and I\u2019ll be 20 minutes into it and it will hit my like a ton of bricks, like what if the people in the audience didn\u2019t like the movie? Now they\u2019re listening to someone babble on about how they made the thing that hey don\u2019t even like. Can you imagine a worse fate than listening to someone talk about a thing that you don\u2019t even like? Tim Ferriss: I have to say, and this is not going to get a lot of sympathy from most people listening to this but I have a lot more empathy for people in the public light than I did, say, ten years ago. Because you wonder, like: I wonder if that guy thinks I\u2019m a total dick? But it just so happens your cat got run over by a car, and your kid pissed on your trousers before you had to go to an important meeting, and then your wife called and was really upset. And then some guy dropped your coffee on the floor and you\u2019re just in a shitty mood and that person happens to come up to you as you\u2019re running to the gate to catch a flight that you\u2019re going to miss. And they have a 30 second exposure to you in a really rare off moment and they\u2019re like: wow, that guy is an asshole. Mike Birbiglia: Or you literally just sprained your wrist grabbing through a suitcase. I had that happen on this last trip. And then someone comes up to you right at that moment and says: hey, I\u2019m a big fan. I\u2019m like, this is a really strange thing to say; I\u2019m in a lot of pain right now. Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re like: yeah, I met that guy; he made put the most ridiculous story. He blamed it on his wrist. I had this experience yesterday, which was hilarious and infuriating at the same time. This is yet another reason to stay off social media. I saw this guy who I suppose you could call him a journalist or a media producer who I had been pinging me via text message for awhile. I\u2019d been traveling out of the country, this and that. It\u2019s like: get together, have drinks, and like: hey buddy, how\u2019s it going? I guess I didn\u2019t reply to them. So his Tweet was, \u201cTim Ferriss is like an arrogant, self centered ass but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn lessons from him.\u201d And I was like: oh, so this is what happens when I\u2019m out of the country for two months and miss someone\u2019s text; they assume malice. I remember a piece of advice I was given, or read at some point \u2013 I mix those up \u2013 and I\u2019ve modified it a bit: never attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence. Now, the way I\u2019ve modified that is: never attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or business. It\u2019s just like you don\u2019t know what battle someone else is fighting. They might come off as a dick and it\u2019s like \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give away too much in the movie but it\u2019s like something catastrophic could have happened that they\u2019re not being open about because they don\u2019t want to be open about it. Just assume that it\u2019s not a personal attack. But I\u2019m getting up on a soapbox; let me chill myself out. Mike Birbiglia: I think that\u2019s good advice. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve done 100 cities. Do you have a favorite meal that comes to mind? And maybe it\u2019s pizza; could be but is there a favorite meal or drink of yours that comes to mind? Mike Birbiglia: I think some combination. I love great macaroni and cheese. I love going to the fanciest restaurant you can imagine and just ordering macaroni and cheese, or ordering the hamburger. Because I always find that if you go to someplace that\u2019s $50 a plate or something like that, sure you can order the chicken or the steak or whatever but man, can they make a hamburger. Tim Ferriss: Now, is that for your joy or is it remotely flawed with the kitchen? Mike Birbiglia: No, I\u2019m not trying to blame the system. Tim Ferriss: So you\u2019re not asking for super well done, because I know that makes chefs completely insane. Mike Birbiglia: No, no. I think it\u2019s a cuisine loophole. It\u2019s a great secret in cuisine which is that you order the kind of inexpensive pedestrian item on a really expensive, fancy menu is more often than not amazing. If you\u2019re in a fancy restaurant and for whatever reason there\u2019s peanut butter and jelly on the menu, order the peanut butter and jelly because those people aren\u2019t fucking around. Tim Ferriss: God, I love it. No, that\u2019s good advice. I remember I had two different pieces of advice from two very good chefs. One said if you go out to a restaurant, never have the roast chicken because you can always make roast chicken at home. Mike Birbiglia: Yes, I think that\u2019s smart. Tim Ferriss: You can always make it at home. But I had someone else say if you can get roast chicken on the menu at a fancy restaurant, get the roast chicken because everyone an make it at home; you think you know roast chicken. This may be along the lines of the PB&J; order the PB&J. If you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say? Mike Birbiglia: I\u2019d put it in Times Square and it would say, \u201cNone of these companies care about you.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Ooh, I like it. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s one of the things that I feel like I\u2019ve learned over the years, which is that we\u2019ve come to trust corporations in a certain sense and we forget the fact that they actually have no vested interest in us other than our money. Which harkens back to the thing I was saying about gatekeepers. I have very much of a niched career. I have a career where if people know my work, more often than not, they\u2019re like: that\u2019s great, I\u2019m a huge fan, this is great what you do. But most people don\u2019t know who I am. It\u2019s the definition of niche. I don\u2019t get stopped in the street almost ever, which is great; it\u2019s phenomenal. And so in relation to that, I do things that are self produced. I\u2019m a producer on my movies, I\u2019m a producer on my one man shows, I produced my tour; it\u2019s all in house and I try not to bow to the gatekeepers of show business because they don\u2019t care about me. They really don\u2019t. The networks and the studios, all they care about is whether or not my movie or my TV show or whatever it would be would make them money. So why would I try to please those people? The people I\u2019m trying to please is my audience. They\u2019re the people who buy my albums or go buy movie tickets. Those are the people I care about; those are the people I\u2019m making movies for. So my billboard is these companies don\u2019t care about you. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any other rules that you\u2019ve developed for\u2026 I was going to say the business side of the art that you\u2019re involved with but just in terms of managing your life and career, are there any other rules you\u2019ve set for yourself that have helped you to have the success and longevity that you\u2019ve had? Mike Birbiglia: I think my advice is just to try to figure out what they do well in the system; the studio system, the network system and just pull it out and replicate the parts that you think work and then do the rest yourself. My first off Broadway show was Sleepwalk With Me, and it was very much by the book. It was produced in this way, the off Broadway system. It had a general manager and a general management company that took such and such a fee, and it had this many people who are on the payroll and all this kind of stuff. And my agent and I, after the fact because the show, even though it was this big success and it ran for eight months, the show technically \u2013 this is a very common thing in Hollywood \u2013 it lost money, technically. I guess the most famous story of this is The Simpsons. The Simpsons franchise, I don\u2019t know if this is true still but a few years ago, it was not in profit. Have you ever heard that story? Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t heard the story of The Simpsons but I\u2019ve read some articles on Hollywood accounting. Mike Birbiglia: Hollywood accounting is crazy; it\u2019s bananas. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s completely bonkers. It\u2019s on par with \u2013 I\u2019m making this up; I don\u2019t know if this is accurate so don\u2019t sue me, GM but when people are like: oh yeah, GM paid no taxes last year, or Apple paid no taxes last year. And you\u2019re like: what? It\u2019s absolutely on par where you\u2019re like: oh, the movie grossed a billion dollars but no one saw any back end participation mysteriously for these various reasons that are detailed in this article. But no, I haven\u2019t heard the Simpsons example. Mike Birbiglia: Another example is my last movie, Sleepwalk With Me, I won\u2019t name the names involved but it didn\u2019t technically make money, even though it did like 2.25 at the box office which is a lot for a small film that was made for $1 million. And then it did probably a million whatever \u2013 maybe more \u2013 digitally on Netflix and iTunes and all these things. And so it quote-unquote made somewhere between 3 and 5 million dollars. We made it for a million dollars\u2019 budget, which is like nothing in the world of independent film. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, super budget. Mike Birbiglia: And the movie didn\u2019t make money. I\u2019m trying not to curse but it doesn\u2019t fucking make sense. It doesn\u2019t make sense at all. And so this time around, I was like: alright, I\u2019m going to cut out all the people who charged the movie, so to speak, and became like a line item in the budget for the marketing and the distribution of the movie and I\u2019m just going to do it myself. So Don\u2019t Think Twice is essentially self distributed in cooperation with this company, the Film Arcade, which is a small distribution company that I basically told my story to. And we\u2019re like, let\u2019s build this from scratch. I\u2019ll go from town to town, I\u2019ll go to 30 cities and I\u2019ll hand deliver this movie. So my whole summer has been me going town to town showing sneak previews of the movie and then doing a free improv workshop for improv theaters in that town. So we\u2019re going to IO in Chicago, and UCB in New York, and the Torch Theater in Phoenix, the Planet Ant Theater in Detroit which is where Keegan-Michael Key started. And we\u2019re doing these free workshops as an act of good will. Because basically, we thought why don\u2019t we, instead of buying a ton of TV ads and this and that, all the traditional marketing, why don\u2019t we spend that money just having me be a walking billboard for the movie and go town to town and spread good will? Say: hey, we\u2019re going to do free improv workshops, we\u2019re going to give out free tickets to local improv theaters and we\u2019re going to do Q&As. So to get back to what you\u2019re saying in a business sense, I would say steal the ideas that corporations use that work and then fill in the rest yourself. Tim Ferriss: Steal the thunder from the gods. Mike Birbiglia: Yes, exactly. Tim Ferriss: It doesn\u2019t actually belong to them anyway, in a lot of senses. I\u2019m really excited about that. I\u2019m continually excited about this type of experiment, and particularly given my experience with the podcast, which after many, many years is really the first, in a sense aside from the blog and so on, the first free agent enterprise that I\u2019ve had complete unilateral creative control over. Mike Birbiglia: The indoctrination of podcasts has been incredible for radio. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s such a boon and such a joy. And for that reason, I\u2019m going to be experimenting with a lot of different approaches with publishing as it relates to books and otherwise. Because every time I have in the past let someone pay for something, which is usually bloated in some capacity as you mentioned\u2026 Mike Birbiglia: The whole publishing industry is bloated. Tim Ferriss: You will not have the control or the protections you would want as a doer. So how can people see the frequently, infrequently, or moderately? And of course, it\u2019s kind of contingent, I suppose, upon when people are hearing this but how would you like people to check it out? I have really been enjoying it; Chris Sacca loved it. I\u2019ve heard great things from a number of different people and I certainly recommend people check it out. But where can they learn more and see more? Mike Birbiglia: There\u2019s a site called don\u2019tthinktwicemovie.com, the Twitter handle @dontthink. My Twitter handle is @birbigs, B-I-R-B-I-G-S. I\u2019m traveling [01:30:00] around the country, so like 30 cities; with people\u2019s help, Don\u2019t Think Twice will get into 300 to 500 theaters across the country, and maybe more. But it\u2019s entirely contingent to the people listening to this. I\u2019m at Nantucket Film Festival right now, and there are great movies. There\u2019s this documentary called Tickle, that\u2019s phenomenal. There\u2019s this movie called Other People, that Chris Kelly made. There\u2019s Captain Fantastic, which I was telling you about. There\u2019s a Norman Leer documentary. There are so many great independent films. And what I urge people to do is go to your local cinema, and see small films. Read a few reviews and go to the ones you think might work for you. It really does help for there to be more of them. No one\u2019s getting rich on an independent film but if the movie makes a few million dollars, I\u2019ll get to make another movie and I\u2019ll put my heart and soul into it. So that\u2019s what I would ask. Tim Ferriss: Just for people who are wondering, those people who have been listening to me or following me long enough know this, that I take endorsing things very, very seriously. It\u2019s very easy to destroy a reputation that takes a long time to build. I feel very comfortable recommending this movie. When I was watching it earlier with Cal, at one point a few minutes into it, he said, \u201cWait a second. Is this documentary or script?\u201d Mike Birbiglia: Great. Tim Ferriss: That is just about the highest compliment as it relates to acting that appears completely natural. I thought to myself, wow, that is a very rare comment. And this is coming from someone who\u2019s had a lot of immersion in the arts and entertainment, also. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s a huge compliment, thank you. Tim Ferriss: Yes, so everybody definitely check it out and I will put all of the links in the show notes, as usual, at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. Two last questions. This one is what is the best or most worthwhile investment you\u2019ve ever made? That could be time, money, energy and just as an example to buy a little time, Amelia Boone, who has been on the podcast, she\u2019s won the World\u2019s Toughest Mudder three times and is the most successful female obstacle courser in the world. Her answer to me was paying her first $450 entrance fee, which was a stretch at the time, for World\u2019s Toughest Mudder. So it seemed like a huge stretch but it completely set her on \u2013 pun intended \u2013 this course in her life. She\u2019s also a power attorney at Apple and just a complete machine. What would you offer as your answer to that? Mike Birbiglia: I would say spend $15.00 on a yoga class. I started doing yoga two years ago and if I hadn\u2019t started, I feel like my body would have broken down completely and I\u2019d be in a sling. My wife convinced me to do yoga after years of telling me that I should do yoga, which is hilarious if you people don\u2019t have the visual picture of me. Or they might, but you wouldn\u2019t think of me as someone who does yoga. And I certainly don\u2019t do it well. But if you can find a good place for beginners, oh, my God, I find it to be completely helpful for being productive and being healthy. Tim Ferriss: I think people are as old as their joints feel so if you sit down a lot, it is good to stretch. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of acro yoga for the last two years and my hips and back have never felt better. Mike Birbiglia: That\u2019s great. Tim Ferriss: So I would also encourage people that if for whatever reason you can\u2019t get tickets to standup comedy by Mr. Birbigs, if you see him in line for a yoga class and want to get some indirect comedy by watching his downward dog and cobra poses, then that is much like the culinary loophole you talked about earlier. Mike Birbiglia: I\u2019ll tell you this is going to sound like I\u2019m kissing up but my wife urged me to wedge this in somehow, which is if the people just listen to the podcast and they don\u2019t have your book, get your Four Hour Workweek, I believe your first book. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s the first book, yes. Mike Birbiglia: Which is how I was introduced to your work. Because I have a completely different outlook on vacation now. The way that you talk about essentially we\u2019re working these 80 hour weeks, let\u2019s say, for this pie in the sky idea of retirement at the end of our lives that God knows what the hell that even is anyway. And live that retirement in fits and spurts in the middle of your life so you understand the perspective of what that even is. And because of that, my wife and I took a vacation to Laguna Beach where I shut off my computer for five days at the beginning of June and it\u2019s literally because of your book. Tim Ferriss: Thank you for sharing that. That makes my day. And Laguna Beach is a great choice; that\u2019s a beautiful spot. Mike Birbiglia: I searched all over. I\u2019m an amateur travel agent. Tim Ferriss: For those people who haven\u2019t read the book, the balloon payment at the end for the deferred life plan is far from guaranteed. Mike Birbiglia: Far from guaranteed. Tim Ferriss: Far from guaranteed so it\u2019s good to break up the work with many retirements for sure. Is there any ask or request as we wrap up, any parting comments or asks or requests from my audience? Mike Birbiglia: No, just follow the movie @dontthinkmovie on Twitter or follow me @birbigs on Twitter. Trust me that the movie is really good and I think you\u2019ll laugh, and I think you might cry. Take someone on a date, take a few of your friends. There\u2019s a lot of love that went into making something that a lot of people so far have liked. So yeah, it would just mean a lot to me. Tim Ferriss: It also supports an ecosystem of creators creating, which I\u2019m extremely passionate about and I think pretty well informed regarding. I would tell people every time I have to or choose to review something, whether it\u2019s a book or a movie or anything else, right before an interview I\u2019m always nervous. And I\u2019m just like: oh, God, am I going to have to tap dance around the fact that I didn\u2019t like something, by the glaring omission of mentioning it or anything like that. And within five minutes of putting this on, I was like: oh, thank fucking God, I don\u2019t have to deal with any of that. It was such a wash of relief. So I do encourage people to check it out. And Mike, I know you\u2019ve got a lot going on right now. You\u2019re juggling all of the activities that go with taking matters into your own hands with a creative endeavor like this. So I certainly send good vibes to you for the endurance and courage and strength that you will need on the road. Mike Birbiglia: Thank you. Tim Ferriss: This is great fun so I really appreciate you taking the time. Mike Birbiglia: Thanks, and as a disclaimer to anybody who\u2019s listening to this and going: I don\u2019t even like Mike Birbiglia\u2019s comedy; why am I listening to him talk about it, just know on a lot of days, I don\u2019t like it either. So I might be wrong about everything I\u2019ve just said but I\u2019m just trying my best like anybody else. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s all we can ask, man. Everybody\u2019s just trying to get by, one day at a time. Mike Birbiglia: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Mike, best of luck with everything and to everyone listening, as always, I\u2019ll mention it again: you can find links to everything, including the movie, including social, including books and DVDs and so on that came up in the show notes as well as those notes for every other episode at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. And until next time and as always, thank you for listening.

first film was called sleepwalk with me", "if people want to see it, it\u2019s on netflix and it\u2019s easy to find", "after i made it, i went back to improvising at ucb theatre after years of taking time off from improv", "i\u2019d studied it in college, etc", "ucb", "upright citizens brigade theatre in los angeles", "the reason i went back to it was because i realized that so many of the principles that you see at the beginning of the movie and that you probably studied in your class say: yes, it\u2019s all about the group; don\u2019t think, just do", "all those principles are really what got me through directing a film, which was the hardest thing \u2013 by far \u2013 i\u2019ve ever done in my entire life", "after i directed it, i was like how the hell did i even live through that", "how did i even stay alive", "and i realized it was all these things that improv had taught me", "so i veered back into doing improv", "one night my wife, who is brilliant, came to one of my improve shows", "she made this observation, and i thought it was wonderful", "because i think on that given night, guest improvisers sit in with me, a show called mike birbiglia\u2019s dream, and any given week it will be aidy bryant from snl, or ellie kemper from kimmy schmidt or zach woods from silicon valley", "and my wife said, \u201cit\u2019s amazing watching this art form with these people because it\u2019s all about the group and how everyone\u2019s equal, but in real life that person\u2019s a tv star, that person\u2019s a movie star and that person shares a one bedroom in bushwick with five dudes who live on air mattresses.\u201d and i thought, man, that\u2019s not just a great observation; it\u2019s a whole movie", "that is a whole movie to me", "and i could just see the movie", "i started just writing out this really kind of what i\u2019d call a throw up pass of the movie script", "i would go to coffee shops in the morning", "my minimum is three hours; i\u2019d stick myself in a coffee shop with no internet and no email, no anything", "if it\u2019s going well, i go up to five hours and if it\u2019s not going well, i just end at three hours", "sorry to interrupt",

and act in a trance", "you don\u2019t want to even think consciously about what you\u2019re putting on the page for fear of oh, you wrote this down in your book", "you write them as emails to people", "and i think that\u2019s brilliant", "that\u2019s in your book, right", "it is, and just for people who don\u2019t have that context \u2013 or i might have talked about it in an interview, perhaps", "i said i basically threw out the first few drafts of four or five chapters of the four hour workweek because it was either too pompous or too slapstick", "and then i decided to literally go into an email compose window and write the first chapter as if it were just a letter to a close friend after me having had two drinks; that was basically it, the approach", "that\u2019s so brilliant", "and a lot of times what i do is i\u2019ll write in my journal as though it will never be seen by anyone ever, and then more often than not the things that i put in my secret journal are the things that i publish", "and when you sit down at the coffee shop, 7 a.m", "or just beforehand, a couple of things", "do you have a particular type of coffee or beverage, and then do you use word", "i do a cappuccino and i movie magic screenwriter is the program i use, or i write in a notebook by hand", "i try to write as much by hand in a nice notebook that has some meaning to me", "last summer i was on tour for the movie trainwreck with dave attell and amy schumer, vanessa bayer and it was my birthday", "dave attell got me a journal", "it was really sweet", "he just gave me a little gift for my birthday", "we were in seattle on tour and he gave me a nice journal", "that\u2019s really nice", "one of my favorite standup comics; never had any interaction with him but really amazing", "yeah, one of the greats", "i asked him if he would sign it just on the back somewhere", "so i have a dave attell notebook", "the signature series", "i think of it as it\u2019s blessed", "you know, like sometimes people ask me to sign their notebook, and i\u2019ll write, \u201ci bless these jokes.\u201d with my friends, you know andrew dost, who\u2019s a musician who\u2019s in the band \u201cfun,\u201d he came to see my off broadway show, thank god for jokes", "he actually brought me a journal as a gift", "i asked him if he would sign it, and so he wrote this nice note", "there\u2019s something about the personal element and the personal relationship with notebooks that i think can be helpful to the writer", "a couple of perhaps mundane questions but i\u2019m curious nonetheless; movie magic screenwriter", "why do you use that instead of, say, final cut or something like that", "it\u2019s so stupid", "i\u2019m a real wonk with screenwriting", "i listen to the script notes podcast with craig mason and john august, and those guys despise final cut; they just despise it \u2013 oh, i\u2019m sorry; final draft", "i always mix those up", "i just incepted you with the wrong information, sorry", "yes, final draft", "but anyway, a few years ago i stumbled across movie magic and i like it", "there\u2019s no good reason, necessarily", "and actually, this is a real quirk that i rarely admit to anyone, never mind in public", "to finish the script i found that i kept putting it off and putting it off, and i was analyzing my habits", "and i was like, i\u2019m putting off writing the script but i\u2019m not putting off having lunch with brian koppelman or having lunch with my brother or whatever", "so i thought, i\u2019m always on time and i always show up to things so why don\u2019t i do that for myself", "so what i did was i put a handwritten note next to my bed that said \u2013 and it has three exclamation points: \u201cmike!!", "you have a meeting at caf\u00e9 pedlar\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s where i was writing \u2013 \u201cat 7 a.m", "with your mind,\u201d which is so stupid", "it\u2019 s so embarrassing to admit but it worked", "if it works, it works", "yes, if it works, it works", "i was like, i have a meeting", "it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s with myself but it\u2019s a meeting and i have to be on time", "i love that", "i love it that the human mind is such an odd amalgamation of sensical and nonsensical behaviors", "i just love it", "when you brain vomit\u2026 so i vomited the script out in a few weeks", "is it scenes", "do you start with just stream of consciousness lines you want to include", "yes, that\u2019s exactly right", "it goes from stream of consciousness: i\u2019d like to see a scene of this, i\u2019d like to see a scene of this, i\u2019d like to hear this piece of dialogue", "i corkboard my walls", "it\u2019s silly when you see my office", "it\u2019s just like a wall of corkboard", "one of the three by fives i put up, i put up all of these mind writing slogans which you can look up, things like an ezra pound quote that i have on my wall that is literally three words", "i think it\u2019s one of the best quotes for writing: \u201conly emotion endures.\u201d i always try to keep that in mind when i\u2019m writing because i think it\u2019s just a really crucial idea", "you said mind writing quotes", "yeah, mind writing quotes", "you can do googles for mind writing quotes, and it\u2019s like quotes from writers collected over time by famous writers", "you look around and there are lines from hemmingway, and lines from george orwell and jack kerouac", "it was funny because it was something that elma baker, who is a producer on this american life actually gave me as a tip when i was writing my book, sleepwalk with me and other painfully true stories", "she said, \u201cwhen i wrote my book, i had all these mind writing slogans on the wall.\u201d i used it and i find it to be really, really helpful", "so only emotion endures, was that the quote", "only emotion endures", "what does that mean to you", "a lot of times as a writer you get hung up on cultural references", "if you see a comedian, a lot of times the way that i lose interest in comedians, for example, or sitcoms or movies or whatever, is they get hung up on a cultural reference; a joke about a cultural reference that literally will be gone in four years or five years", "like there\u2019s a reference to twitter in my movie, don\u2019t think twice", "i was very cautious to think through the implications of in ten years when twitter no longer exists, or becomes the myspace of the future, will that reference make sense to the viewer and advance the story", "because you always have to think in those terms", "there\u2019s a part of sleepwalk with me, the movie, where my character is figuring out how to drive to one of his gigs and he uses google maps", "it\u2019s like a very key visual, and i had to think okay, what\u2019s going to be the mapping system of the future and will people be able to grasp what this mapping system is in relation to the story", "in other words, if you get too hung up in making cultural jokes, about things that might go away, then that whole five minutes of the movie is sort of dead, in a way", "it\u2019s at risk afirma when you have that topical hook", "yeah, and so with this movie, it was really what is this about", "it\u2019s about friends", "it\u2019s about a group of friends coping with what it\u2019s like to be in their 30s and confront the idea that they might not be successful the way they thought they were going to be successful in life, and what does that mean", "what does that mean for their lives", "what does it mean for their friendships", "so whenever it would veer into something that was like a cultural reference, i\u2019d be like: no, let\u2019s pull it back to it\u2019s about friends", "so that\u2019s what i mean by mind writing flow", "then i would have also on the wall things that felt like principles for the movie", "when my wife made the observation of how everyone\u2019s equal on stage but off stage they\u2019re completely unequal, i wrote on the wall this thing i made up which is, \u201cart is socialism but life is capitalism.\u201d and that was a guiding principle for the film", "i like that", "how can that be a conflict between these friends", "you should add your own quote to the mind writing quotes collection", "you know who bites me on that is bernie supporters", "they go: yeah, but it doesn\u2019t have to be", "and i get their point", "at what point, then, do you invite your friends over and ply them with pizza", "what form, like how rough is it when you give it to them", "probably about two months in", "i started writing two years ago at the end of april", "it was june 10th i had people over", "so it was two months in draft and i had people over", "and i\u2019d preface it", "i\u2019d say it might not be good, and thanks for coming", "i had ten or 12 of those at my house", "they ended up being some of the most fun part of the process entirely", "because there\u2019s really no stakes to showing your friends your work", "it feels like there\u2019s stakes; i was very nervous", "but it\u2019s just there\u2019s something communal about it; something fun about it", "do you do a table read", "do you have people take roles or do they all just read in silence and then give you feedback", "how does it work", "no, i have them read it aloud", "i would have my assistant at the time, greg, would read the screen directions and i would assign parts", "i would highlight the scripts for people and then we\u2019d read it aloud", "then we\u2019d eat pizza, and we\u2019d just kind of talk about what it made us feel like", "the director of my one person shows is this guy named seth barrow", "he\u2019s a really brilliant theater director", "he always does this thing dramaturgically", "oh, good word", "i will pitch him what i\u2019m working on, what my idea is or a piece of writing", "i even did it this week because i was asked to write a piece for a storytelling piece at nantucket film festival", "i read it to him over the phone, and then he says back to me, well, what i get from that is this", "and it\u2019s a nonjudgmental way of interfacing with a collaborator", "so in other words, he reads the script and then he says, what i get from it is it\u2019s a group of friends and one of them ends up being more successful than the other", "and then they\u2019re all trying to figure out what they\u2019re doing with their lives", "so if he says that back to me and i think to myself: no, it\u2019s more than that; it\u2019s actually about this, this and this", "and he says: well, that\u2019s not what i got from it", "it\u2019s actually helpful to the process because i think one of the most important things about writing is that people are getting what you\u2019re intending", "like i listened to an interview with ron howard where he was talking about how he shows his movie to tons of test audiences so that they can tell him what the vision for the movie should be in the rough cut form", "but it\u2019s to find out whether his vision is landing with people", "and if it\u2019s not landing, then he\u2019s not conveying it correctly and he goes back and reworks it a lot", "so that\u2019s how i like to think of the screenplay process", "what i\u2019m doing essentially in my living room in my shabby apartment in brooklyn is basically what they\u2019re doing on the $100 million level in hollywood with tons more money, and fancier offices", "it\u2019s quote-unquote development in hollywood", "they develop these screenplays for years and years and years, and it\u2019s all these executives giving notes", "but i don\u2019t want executives to give notes to me; i want writers to give notes to me, and i want actors to give notes", "i want collaborators who actually do the things that i like and who i aspire to be like", "i invite people over who are way better writers than me", "i have no business getting notes from phil lord, who\u2019s a director of 21 jump street and the lego movie; he just has a brilliant, brilliant mind", "but who cares", "i\u2019m just going to ask him to come", "if he doesn\u2019t want to come, that\u2019s fine, too", "do you generally go through, say, a five minute scene in its entirety and then people do a post mortem and give their thoughts", "or will they read a line and say: you know what, my character wouldn\u2019t say that; that\u2019s weird, it sounds stilted", "how do you actually facilitate", "we read it start to finish", "so we read it like it\u2019s a table read for a sitcom or a movie", "then at the end, we just kind of adjourn and some fiery discussion starts", "a lot of people give their thoughts, and they really conflict with other people\u2019s thoughts and those people fight with each other, and i listen to that", "it\u2019s really helpful", "so you don\u2019t swear on stage, generally, as i understand it although sacca said one or two funny exceptions, perhaps", "true", "and in the recent show, thank god for jokes, i actually dissect why i don\u2019t curse gratuitously on stage and why, in some ways in the thank god for jokes show, i departed from that a little bit", "which i can explain", "yeah, please explain", "because for instance, i am an avid consumer of standup, love it", "i\u2019ve heard, for instance, dirty jim gaffigan", "but he\u2019s largely sanitized but he can often pull it off", "so what is your logic behind your approach", "my logic started off in kind of an embarrassing way, which is to say that my parents were very upset that i was going to pursue comedy", "my dad\u2019s a doctor and my mom\u2019s a nurse; those are professions where people help other people and are ashamed of their artistic children", "my mom was so upset when i was moving to new york, and she said don\u2019t become one of those dirty comedians", "and i said okay", "she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to use those words to be funny", "for example, oprah\u2019s very funny.\u201d and i was like, \u201cmom, i\u2019m not sure you understand my goal", "i\u2019m not trying to be the queen of daytime.\u201d but it stuck with me because you know, you want to make your parents happy", "you want to pursue your goals but these people gave you everything and so you should heed that, to some extent", "so i\u2019ve tried not to curse for a lot of years", "but i do feel conflicted about that sometimes because a lot of comedians i admire most did curse on stage; lenny bruce, richard pryor", "and then some of them who famously don\u2019t curse are secretly criminals", "that was a bill cosby reference", "but yeah, so i\u2019m somewhere in between that", "i will say i don\u2019t curse gratuitously more often as word choice than it is to sanitize it for people who object for christian reasons about words", "i curse quite a bit in my life, but when you\u2019re a writer, i think that word choice is important; i thin word variety is important", "i don\u2019t know if you curse in the podcast\u2026 i do occasionally but i try not to be egregious", "if you say the f word 75 times in an hour, that\u2019s poor word choice", "you\u2019re not being creative", "it\u2019s lazy", "it\u2019s like using the adjective \u201cinteresting\u201d as a modifier for [inaudible] [crosstalk]", "ah, yes", "as a matter of fact, there\u2019s this brilliant film that calls out that point at the festival called captain fantastic, and it\u2019s coming out i think in september", "is this with viggo mortensen", "it is, yes", "a friend of mine saw a screener and said it was fantastic", "it\u2019s wonderful", "it\u2019s a father who raises his family in the woods, like off the grid, so to speak, in washington state", "he won\u2019t let the kids say the word \u201cinteresting\u201d because it doesn\u2019t mean anything", "it made me reconsider that as a word choice and try to banish it from my vocabulary", "but the point is, i don\u2019t think the f word is effective as a monologue unless you\u2019re using it to the right effect, to the good effect", "for those who are interested in delving into the etymology and various uses of the word \u201cfuck,\u201d which is in fact very flexible, there is a book called english as a second fucking language, that is a fantastic short read", "i think it has a quote from steven king \u2013 i might be making this up; don\u2019t sue me, steven \u2013 on the front, or some huge name", "who do you run jokes by", "i run them by primarily audiences", "i go out and i bomb with jokes and see what lives", "also, my brother joe", "my brother joe introduced me to comedy when i was a kid", "he was a senior in high school and i was in eight or ninth grade, and i was helping him write these satire issues of the newspaper", "so that was my introduction to comedy", "he took me to see steven wright live, and that changed my life", "that was when i was in high school and it just changed the way i thought about everything", "it was an epiphany moment of i want to do that; that\u2019s what i can do", "and i started writing in my notebook, and i wrote all these kind of steven wright rip-off jokes, really", "24 hour banking", "who has time for that", "exactly, yeah", "i went to a drive in movie in a cab", "the movie cost me $95.00", "they\u2019re just great", "they\u2019re just endlessly great if people are interested in that type of joke", "another great joke writer in that vein is mitch hedberg, who i\u2019m sure people are familiar with", "so good", "but anyway, once i saw steven wright, i was like, this is over; i\u2019m doing this", "then when i was in college, i entered a standup comedy contest and i won, so it got me a chance to perform at the dc improv", "then i got a job working the door at the dc improv", "but the point is that my brother joe and i always would kick around jokes, ever since i was 19 years old", "and now he\u2019s worked for me, or he\u2019s worked with me", "we\u2019ve run our production company for the last ten years together", "i poached him from being an ad copy writer", "because he had gone sort of the route that my parents had wanted me to go, and i veered into comedy and then i sort of brought him along when i was able to financially do that", "pulled him to the dark side", "i pulled him to the dark side and yeah, he\u2019s an extraordinary writer so i run everything by him", "but the big thing is also i run stuff by ira glass when we\u2019re working on something for this american life", "i run stuff by seth barrish when we\u2019re working on something for one of my one person shows", "and then my wife quite a bit, and then audiences", "audiences are the big determiner of what is worth saying", "and when i say audiences, it doesn\u2019t have to be 2,000 people", "ten people at the comedy cellar at 2 in the morning, i can understand whether a bit is going to work for five years", "i love watching comedians work material, and i\u2019ve seen a number of them with notepads who are friends of mine working on material", "they\u2019ll apologize after the fact, and i\u2019m like: no, are you kidding me", "this is what i want to see", "i can always see the finished product on hbo or wherever it ends up coming out", "this is the in process stuff that i want to see", "me too; i love it", "so let me dig into some of the details and see if there\u2019s anything to discuss", "so the process of eliciting feedback, when you pass something by someone, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s comedy and you\u2019re talking to ira glass or someone like that", "are there any particular questions that you ask", "and the reason i bring that up is that when i have my friends who are writers proofread my writing, let\u2019s say for a book, i ask them first to highlight anything that is confusing or unclear", "oh, that\u2019s good", "whether they love or hate something is secondary to clarity", "as long as it\u2019s clear, they can hate it but i want them to understand what i\u2019m saying and then it kind of goes on from there", "that\u2019s similar to the ron howard idea; is what i\u2019m creating being conveyed the way that i meant for it to be conveyed", "right", "so in your case, ira is a brilliant man but not a comedian, s far as i can tell, although he has his moments of being funny, certainly", "oh, very funny, yes", "with someone like ira, or anyone else, is there a particular way that you elicit feedback to make it as helpful as possible", "usually i will tell people bits and jokes over the phone, partly because they can sort of peacefully give feedback in a way that\u2019s not judgmental", "when you\u2019re face to face with somebody, it consumer be hard to say a joke to them and have them feel the pressure of oh, i should laugh or i should politely respond", "on the phone it\u2019s pretty easy to just kind of like skim through stuff and i can hear when people are interested by what\u2019s being said", "quentin tarantino \u2013 i\u2019ve read this \u2013 will call people endlessly and pitch them movies that he\u2019s working on", "he says he doesn\u2019t even have to hear the laughter; he can hear in their silence what their interest level is", "it\u2019s like the silence whisperer", "exactly", "there\u2019s some truth to that", "if you pitch stuff to people all the time, after awhile you kind of get the sense of are they hooked or are they not", "if they\u2019re not hooked, you should consider another direction", "yeah, definitely", "tarantino is a fascinating case", "i\u2019m hoping to have him on the podcast sometime in the next six to 12 months, which i think could happen", "this is a very broad question", "why did you make it, so to speak, in a business where very few people do", "you\u2019ve reached a level of success across several different art forms, but let\u2019s just look at comedy and the various iterations of that", "what were the decisions you made, or chance encounters or mentors, or whatever it might be that contributed it to you making it, at least that being the perception, certainly", "when i was 19, i had a bladder tumor", "they caught it early", "it was a malignant tumor so every three months for the next five years, i would have to go for a cystoscopy where they would look inside my bladder and see if the cancer had returned", "and it didn\u2019t", "i was very, very lucky", "it\u2019s like almost 20 years later and i go for a cystoscopy now every two years ago", "but at the exact, same time that i had this kind of life threatening ailment happen, i started to do comedy", "i entered a contest, and i won and i got this job at the dc improv", "and i would watch every comedian who would come through the dc improve", "the variety, actually, was really helpful", "i saw larry the cable guy before he was a stadium act", "i saw dave chappelle before he was the chappelle show, and george lopez and margaret cho, kathleen madigan, brian regan, jake johannsen, jim gaffney and all these people", "i watched all of them and i would try to just bug them with questions", "so i had this kind of education in watching a ton of comedy and going to open mikes and trying comedy at the exact, same time where i had this realization from cancer that life is short and can end, and it can end at any time", "and it is, in some ways, the best thing that ever happened to me was that perspective because i became an absolute workaholic, trying to get good fast", "i wanted to become a really great standup comedian really fast", "so i feel like that\u2019s the thing", "there\u2019s this comedian, tommy johnagin who started in the midwest, and i remember he opened for me one time when he was in college", "now he\u2019s been on letterman a lot of times and he\u2019s got a great career", "but when he opened for me when he was in college, he had done standup once or twice", "he quoted this back to me years later", "he goes, \u201cyou gave me this piece of advice the moment i started, and it\u2019s helped me create what i\u2019ve created as a career", "which is if you want to perform five minutes of comedy, write what you think is three hours of great comedy.\u201d because that\u2019s the ratio that it\u2019s going to be", "you\u2019re going to write about three hours of what you think is great, and about five minutes of that is worth showing an audience", "that\u2019s a good quote", "i remember reading at some point, i don\u2019t recall who it was", "i want to say neil gaimon but that\u2019s just because i have a secret infatuation \u2013 not so secret infatuation with neil gaimon", "so this is something helpful that i want to attribute to him somehow", "which was a writer talking about process and discussing the frustration of, say, writing nine or ten pages and only having one or two paragraphs at the end be worthwhile, and feeling like the first nine pages were a waste of time but then emphasizing now, in fact, you needed those first nine pages so that you could produce the two paragraphs that are of use", "that\u2019s a brilliant way of looking at it", "not only that, everything that you do in your life, i\u2019ve realized over the years, is leading to where you are", "so in other words, the fact that in college i worked at the door of dc improve and brought food to people\u2019s tables, and i was a waiter at the toombs when i was in college, and then i was a temp in new york city at a pharmaceutical company", "all of that actually led to the life experience that would be able to put something on the page that feels real", "i went to a little talk at the nantucket film fest this morning with oliver stone", "the thing i wrote down in my notebook from it, my takeaway, was when he was 20 years old, he wrote i think a novel and it got rejected all over new york city, every publisher for two years", "he tried to get it published for two years", "then he joined the army", "when he got out of the army, because of the gi bill he was able to go to film school and he made films", "what he talks about is it was the army that taught him to become self reliant in a way that allowed him to understand how to make films", "he says, \u201cthe army is what took me out of my head and made my understand that it\u2019s not about being just cerebral; it\u2019s about a combination of cerebral and self reliant and being able to survive in the forest or whatever it is.\u201d and that\u2019s what went into this epic film career that oliver stone has had", "and i think that\u2019s worth considering in this discussion", "so given that, which i agree with \u2013 and how old are you now, mike, if you don\u2019t mind me asking", "i just turned 38 this week", "happy birthday", "thanks", "if you were going to give advice, or could give advice to your 20-year-old self, 25 or 30, so you can pick, if you could place us in what you were doing, where you were; what advice would you give to yourself, if any", "i would say write everything down because it\u2019s all very fleeting", "i would say keep a journal, which i have but i would have been more meticulous", "and then i would say don\u2019t bow to the gatekeepers at the head of, in my case, show business but at the gate of any business or any endeavor", "don\u2019t bow to the gatekeepers because i think in essence, there are no gatekeepers", "i think that you are the gatekeeper", "i like that", "it has a vaguely ghostbusters ring to it, also", "but it\u2019s bizarrely true now in history when we look at where we are in film and television and the internet", "there\u2019s this amazing quote, i think it\u2019s at the end of hearts of darkness, which is the documentary about the making of apocalypse now", "i think it\u2019s in the end credits, or it\u2019s one of the final things francis ford coppola i\u2019m pretty sure in the \u201870s said that the best movies in the future, because of the way that technology is moving, the best movies are going to be made by a kid \u2013 just from memory \u2013 a kid in ohio who picks up a camera and starts shooting something", "technology is going to be democratized, and has been, now, in a way that\u2019s unprecedented for film, certainly", "oh, across the board", "you have kids who are programming and piecing together autonomous cars in their garages", "it\u2019s really unbelievable", "although, as the technology or despite the technological changes, much like the quote on your wall, \u201cemotions endure,\u201d the core components of good storytelling i don\u2019t think are going to change all that much", "no, no", "and as a matter of fact, i would say the same thing for my 20-year-old self; don\u2019t waste your time on marketing, just try to get better", "yes, great advice", "i remember a blogger very early on, i think it was robert skogle, actually, said to me, \u201cgood content is the best seo.\u201d so kind of the equivalent of writing online, which everybody is trying to optimize for search engine results and he\u2019s like, \u201cjust put out good content", "people will link to it and that is how you get found.\u201d yes", "and also it\u2019s not about being good; it\u2019s about being great", "because what i find, the older i get, is that a lot of people are good and a lot of people are smart, and a lot of people are clever", "but not a lot of people give you their soul when they perform", "yes, very, very true", "so when you think of the word successful, who\u2019s the first person who comes to mind and why", "i\u2019ll say a political and nonpolitical answer because if people dislike this person, then it kind of goes in one ear and out the other: barack obama", "barack obama to me is very inspiring", "he came from nothing", "he\u2019s president of the united states", "i feel lost on culture, a lot of times", "he doesn\u2019t have to be", "like he doesn\u2019t have to be the president", "he could be an extremely wealthy anything", "like on wall street, he could be a corporate lawyer", "he could be in silicon valley", "he could do anything that would make a person billions of dollars, and he chose to work in service of the country", "i met him at the 75th anniversary of the uso last month, which was really cool", "but then i met him two years ago when my wife was pregnant", "our whole thing was whenever we meet someone who we know doesn\u2019t care about meeting us, my wife and i always try and come up with a trick question that throws them off and they kind of like have to answer or have to think about it", "i give this advice to people", "if you ever see jimmy fallon on the street, don\u2019t be like: i love the tonight show", "just be like: what do you think of kiwi", "and he won\u2019t be able to not be like, i love kiwi", "like just talk to people about a think they didn\u2019t think they were going to talk about", "and then next thing you know, you\u2019re talking to jimmy fallon about kiwi and then you\u2019ll have that for your life", "so our thing with obama was let\u2019s tell him, because my wife was four months pregnant but we hadn\u2019t told anybody yet, was why don\u2019t we tell him you\u2019re pregnant", "and so when we get to the front, i go, \u201cmr", "president, this is my wife, jen", "she\u2019s newly pregnant but don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d and he couldn\u2019t help it", "the president of the united states couldn\u2019t help but be like, \u201cwell, am in first to know?\u201d and my wife say yes", "she goes, \u201cdo you have any parenting advice?\u201d and he goes, \u201cwell, get some sleep.\u201d and we\u2019re like, ha-ha because he\u2019s the president", "you know, it wasn\u2019t that funny comically but he\u2019s like your boss times a million", "but then he got better because he goes, \u201cno, actually, i got something.\u201d he goes, \u201cwhen you bring him home, the poo\u2026\u201d the president said poo", "and the moment he said poo, i thought, this is the greatest day of my life", "like i could die right now and i\u2019d be fine", "he goes, \u201cwhen you bring him home, the poo doesn\u2019t smell", "it doesn\u2019t smell like adult poo", "adult poo smells bad.\u201d and then he looked at me for affirmation, and i was like, \u201cabsolutely, mr", "president; adult poo does indeed smell terrible", "thank you for inviting me to the poo seminar 2015.\u201d and he goes, \u201cand when you bring him home, babies crave structure; in their eating and in their sleeping.\u201d and he goes, \u201cand breastfeeding doesn\u2019t always work out right away", "there\u2019s going to be a little bit of wonky", "don\u2019t freak out", "and if it doesn\u2019t work out, the sleeping, right away; don\u2019t freak out.\u201d and he paused and he thought about it and he goes, \u201cthat\u2019s actually some pretty good advice.\u201d he complimented his own advice", "but i\u2019m telling you, the best thing to do is you\u2019ve got to get people questions they don\u2019t \u2013 and you\u2019re doing it right now \u2013 you\u2019ve got to give people questions they\u2019re not expecting", "and then my nonpolitical answer, people hate obama, i get it, whatever; you\u2019re a republican, i don\u2019t care", "that\u2019s your issue", "but it would be bob dylan", "bob dylan is the great artist of our time because, unlike the rolling stones or the beatles who obviously broke up and some of them have died, but he continues to grow and learn and produce and to change", "time out of mind is a top five bob dylan album of all time, and he made it in his 60s", "it\u2019s unbelievable", "he made freewheelin\u2019 bob dylan when he was 21 years old", "it\u2019s unbelievable", "yeah, when you\u2019ve been doing it for three or four decades, you\u2019ve definitely passed the once you\u2019re lucky, twice you\u2019re good stage", "yes", "the next question, i feel like, has to be out of left field for this to function after that incredible obama story", "so let me try a question that i\u2019ve been dying to ask someone but i feel like you might be game for this", "what are your rules for good sex", "oh wow, that is fascinating", "captain fantastic has this piece of advice in it which i thought was smart, where the father says to the son, \u201cwhen you make love to a woman, be gentle and listen.\u201d and i think that\u2019s wise; i think that\u2019s good advice i think you should have sex, assuming your wife or girlfriend wants this, more than you think you should", "because it\u2019s kind of like pizza; it\u2019s never a bad idea", "you could even add that to the list of your incentives when they\u2019re proofreading, i guess", "and the script might not be good but at the end, we\u2019re all going to have sex", "that\u2019s right", "oh, my god, if that\u2019s the qualification for the next reading series, that will get so many people in the door", "i had a joke on my first album, which is, \u201cpizza\u2019s like sex; when it\u2019s good it\u2019s good, when it\u2019s bad it gets on your shirt.\u201d it\u2019s honestly the dumbest joke but i still enjoy saying it", "is there a book or books that you\u2019ve given frequently as gifts", "i give a book sometimes, but more often i give a dvd of stop making sense", "i\u2019m not familiar with that", "it is the david byrne concert film with the talking heads that jonathan demi directed, i think, in the early \u201880s", "and it\u2019s just a really innovative, strange concert film that\u2019s very much worth watching and taking in in a creative sense because it\u2019s so unorthodox", "it\u2019s called stop making sense and musically, it pays off and i think visually it pays off because it\u2019s very abstract", "that\u2019s the one thing i give", "the other thing is people ask me about my sleepwalking all the time because i have obviously a very serious sleep disorder; it almost killed me", "so i give this book called the promise of sleep, and it was written by dr", "william c", "dement, who is the father of sleep medicine in this decade or even century", "he makes a cameo in my movie, sleepwalk with me, as himself", "but it\u2019s a wonderful book", "people often say to me, because of my sleep disorder, what should i do, i have insomnia, blah, blah, blah", "i always say first of all, get this book and second of all the basic takeaway for starters is an hour or two before bed, turn off your phone, turn off your computer and i forget what the third one is", "but that\u2019s the biggest thing", "think of sleep as something you don\u2019t crash into but that you ease into, that you\u2019re parking the car as opposed to crashing the car in the parking space", "that\u2019s a good point", "i like that analogy", "any other favorite movies or documentaries", "i love terms of endearment and broadcast news are two james l", "brooks films that i can just watch over and over and over again", "i made don\u2019t think twice and i made sleepwalk with me and when i make hopefully the next eight or nine movies, i strive to make movies like those where you\u2019re laughing and you\u2019re crying", "because to me, that\u2019s what all of it is for; it\u2019s to experience the range of emotions within an hour and a half or two hours", "on that point, if you could combine three comedians, alive or dead, into one super comedian, who would you pick", "okay, it would go something like this", "i\u2019m writing this down on a pad", "it would go mitch hedberg, doug stanhope, maria bamford", "so mitch hedberg i think is the greatest joke writer of our time", "i think doug stanhope is the most honest comedian of our time, and i think maria bamford is the most vocally and physically versatile", "unbelievable", "i just think what she does is uncanny", "she drops into these voices that are just these completely vivid, pitch perfect impressions of people in her life and it\u2019s uncanny", "so i would say those three", "that\u2019s a great question, by the way", "i\u2019ve never gotten that question", "i\u2019m going to have to dig in", "i know hedberg, i know maria bamford; i haven\u2019t explored doug stanhope", "is there any particular work", "there\u2019s one called no refunds that\u2019s on netflix", "all of his stuff is meant to make people leave", "so all of the names of his albums are things that imply that you can\u2019t get your money back, essentially", "does that meant hat he does what, as i understand it and i\u2019ve listened to and watched a fair amount of his stuff, but bill burr", "it seems that bill burr will deliberately lose the audiences because it\u2019s no longer a challenge to simply make them laugh; he wants to be able to reel them back in", "is that effectively what doug does", "yeah, it\u2019s precisely that", "seeing doug stanhope live is bill burr actually to the extreme", "it\u2019s like a magic trick", "it\u2019s like watching andy kaufman doing his bit where he does his latka character, speaking the gibberish to the audience and bombing, and people not realizing it\u2019s a character and then going into a pitch perfect elvis impersonation and people go crazy", "it\u2019s this thing where you can\u2019t believe that he lands the show after how terrible he made it", "it\u2019s fascinating", "and bill burr is incredible, too", "bill burr may be very close to that list, as well", "maria, i\u2019ve listened to a lot of her comedy and although i alternatively love and hate this description in the self help business, which i try not to think about much but i get asked about the secret a lot, and manifesting things which is not really a focus of mine, at all", "but maria has this hilarious bit that i always mention", "i\u2019m like, \u201cyou should listen to maria bamford; she talks about the secret.\u201d and there\u2019s this bit where she\u2019s talking about being down and out, and her sister is very successful, corporate, super efficient", "maria has her over at one point, and maria has put together a vision board and there\u2019s a microwave on the board", "and her sister goes, \u201ca microwave", "really", "you want a bucking microwave", "that\u2019s depressing", "i\u2019ll buy you a microwave.\u201d and then maria\u2019s like, \u201cbam", "a manifest!\u201d it\u2019s like oh, my god, so genius", "what purchase comes to mind \u2013 could be recent or whatever \u2013 that has positively impacted your life", "ideally not like a maserati but something that\u2019s on the less expensive side", "this sounds so stupid and current, and speaking of things not enduring \u2013 who knows what this will even be, but i find the fitbit was helpful for me", "because it tracks my sleep", "and so it tells me this thing about my sleep", "it tells you how much you were walking the night before", "no, it\u2019s true", "i don\u2019t know if you know about this but it not only tells you how long you\u2019ve slept but it tells you the quality of sleep", "in other words, it tells you you\u2019ve slept technically for eight hours but you were awake for an hour of that", "so it\u2019s actually quite helpful", "i like it", "so you use it primarily for your sleep, then", "for my sleep, yeah", "i like trying to get to 10,000 steps a day; that\u2019s helpful", "but for the sleep, you\u2019ve got to remember i have slept over at hospitals countless times for sleep studies because i have rem behavior disorder", "it\u2019s like $3,000 per visit", "some of it is insurance but some of it i have to pay", "this thing basically does a sleep study and it costs $100", "what type of nighttime rituals do you have", "you mentioned easing in instead of crashing into the wall", "do you have any particular wind down or evening rituals", "there\u2019s actually a good podcast called \u2013 not to be mistaken with sleepwalk with me, there\u2019s a good podcast called \u201csleep with me.\u201d that could go a lot of directions, okay", "yes", "it\u2019s this guy, he calls himself scooter", "sounds trustworthy", "he has this really uncanny skill of talking in circles and slow, and circling back to the first topic and then the next topic, and another thing, and a digression, and then the next thing you know, you\u2019re asleep", "it\u2019s pretty fascinating, what he does", "i\u2019ll have to try that", "that\u2019s worth looking into", "and then i try to write in my journal", "honestly, the biggest thing is getting off of social media", "getting off of twitter and facebook", "in relationship to what we were talking about earlier when i was saying the thing about oliver stone, that he joined the army and that\u2019s how he became self reliant", "and how ultimately, everything in your life you do leads to who you are and what you\u2019re able to accomplish", "i think that social media is weirdly the exception to that", "i think that social media is this weird kind of looking in the mirror all the time thing", "it\u2019s not helpful for being productive or learning", "i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true but that\u2019s been my feeling lately", "i think the dose makes the poison, certainly", "there\u2019s a point where you\u2019re like: oh, this tylenol is helping my headache", "and then: oh, my stomach lining just fell out of my ass", "has that actually happened", "that hasn\u2019t actually literally happened to me but there\u2019s definitely a point where things in excess become their opposite", "on the flipside, what does the first 60 to 120 minutes of your day look like", "are there any particular rituals that you have in the morning", "it\u2019s a little bit like memento every day", "injecting your wife with insulin over and over again", "just like a lot of times if i\u2019m not focused, i will kind of wander", "until i have coffee, forget about it", "i\u2019m a heavy coffee drinker", "basically if i\u2019m on a project, if i\u2019m shooting a movie, i have a complete and exact plan for the next day", "if i\u2019m writing a movie, like i said, i put notes next to my bed: mike, wake up; go to the coffee shop and write", "i think that when i don\u2019t have a routine, i\u2019m a mess and i\u2019m not productive and it\u2019s not helpful", "so that\u2019s what i\u2019d say; it\u2019s inconsistent", "the other thing is i travel", "the thank god for jokes show, i toured 100 cities in a year", "wow", "it\u2019s very hard to have rituals when you\u2019re going to 100 cities in a year", "yeah, i wonder if it makes the values of the rituals even greater if you are able to maintain some semblance of a routine when touring", "i don\u2019t know; i\u2019ve never done that", "do you have a favorite venue in the entire united states, if you had to pick one", "gosh, there are so many", "the upper citizens brigade theatre in new york city feels like home because i\u2019ve been on that stage a lot, and the comedy cellar in new york feels similarly", "i think that in terms of a pound for pound venue, i think the chicago theater is probably your best concert venue in america", "the chicago theater seats about 3,000 people", "and yet, as a performer, you feel like you\u2019re talking to people in your living room", "and as an audience member, it feels like you\u2019re just watching someone not in your living room but it feels intimate", "you\u2019re a collector of good advice", "what is the worst advice that you hear or see being given out often", "and that could be in any domain; it could be comedy, it could be writing, it could be movies, it could be completely unrelated, anything", "it\u2019s all about getting your dream, pursuing your dream", "i don\u2019t know what the exact advice is that drives me crazy but i think there\u2019s a cultural thing right now that is kind of irksome", "i read it recently in the new york times where someone said \u2013 i\u2019m forgetting who wrote this but she said, \u201cif i advice for college students, it would be don\u2019t ask what do i want to be when i grow up; ask how can i help or how can i change the world, or how can i be of service to other people.\u201d i think the kind of just be whatever you want to be is perhaps to be reconsidered by how can i be of service when i\u2019m on the earth for such a short amount of time", "because when i do my one man shows, for example, seth barrish and i, we\u2019re always talking about how is this story that i\u2019m telling, let\u2019s say sleepwalk with me, it\u2019s a story about how i jumped out a second story window while sleepwalking and it nearly killed me", "i got cut up, i ended up in the emergency room", "i jumped through a window and the glass missed my femoral artery by a centimeter", "and ultimately, we had to figure out not how is this story about me, but how is it about the audience", "and the way we discovered it was about the audience was that it\u2019s about the catharsis you can experience by sharing something that you\u2019re very embarrassed about; in my case having this life threatening sleep disorder that i was embarrassed about", "i thought people would think i\u2019m crazy", "it\u2019s about the catharsis of opening up and telling people about that, and how that can make us feel closer to one another", "and so in that sense, this is a round about way of saying how can what i\u2019m doing be helpful to the audience", "how can they go away feeling empowered in their life as opposed to: oh, that was funny", "because walking away going, oh that was funny, i don\u2019t know, there\u2019s something about it that feels like it\u2019s a missed opportunity", "i remember speaking to john favreau on the podcast about his writing and humor", "i\u2019m paraphrasing here but he said: i don\u2019t aim for funny; i aim for truth and then the funny often comes along with it", "i think that\u2019s absolutely true", "on this point of what you can offer for service, brian koppelman mentioned something in our text exchange which was he, meaning you, chooses to be kind", "it\u2019s a conscious part of who he is and i\u2019m always interested in how he consistently thinks about other people in whatever engagement", "and how going through life that way makes him feel", "can you confirm or deny or elaborate on that", "because i think it\u2019s an observation worth exploring", "if that is a decision you make, has it always been the case", "is it something you came to a particular way", "i think that\u2019s from my mother", "my mother is a very generous person", "she\u2019s been a nurse for her whole career, and then she was an elementary school nurse for awhile", "she\u2019s very catholic, which is not something that i followed in her footsteps with", "yes, she\u2019s just very sweet to everyone", "i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true; it\u2019s nice to hear that someone says that about me", "but yes, i try to be nice to everyone", "i think it\u2019s the right thing to do", "i think that peace on earth is achieved in a micro sense", "peace is achieved through every person who you meet in your day", "it\u2019s an opportunity to contribute to peace everywhere", "maybe it\u2019s na\u00efve but that\u2019s how i think of it", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s na\u00efve", "i think the macros is made up of the micro", "i remember this story i heard, i believe it was from a professor at stanford named b.j", "fogg who decided to teach a class, as professors at stanford are allowed to do, that he effectively made up out of thin air", "and i think it was creating world peace, or something like that", "he had no idea what the syllabus or the curriculum would be whatsoever", "and then 30 students show up, and he tries to figure out what the class is", "he had students from, say, israel, palestine, all over the place and he quickly realized no one could even agree on what world peace went", "like what does world peace look like", "so he said okay, since we can\u2019t agree on world peace \u2013 and this was the interesting part \u2013 he said, \u201clet us try to agree on what the antecedents to world peace would be.\u201d oh, that\u2019s smart", "what are the constituent parts that might make up world peace", "let\u2019s start to agree on some of the ingredients", "then he had them work on projects focused on those common ingredients", "and i do feel like to take something like peace and make it actionable, by necessity you\u2019re going to bring it down to the micro", "otherwise, it\u2019s just not actionable; it\u2019s too abstract", "by the way, i\u2019m fearing as i\u2019m saying this that someone is listening to this going: \u201ci met mike birbiglia and he\u2019s an asshole.\u201d i have that with q&as, like a lot of times touring with don\u2019t think twice, we\u2019ll do q&as and i\u2019ll be 20 minutes into it and it will hit my like a ton of bricks, like what if the people in the audience didn\u2019t like the movie", "now they\u2019re listening to someone babble on about how they made the thing that hey don\u2019t even like", "can you imagine a worse fate than listening to someone talk about a thing that you don\u2019t even like", "i have to say, and this is not going to get a lot of sympathy from most people listening to this but i have a lot more empathy for people in the public light than i did, say, ten years ago", "because you wonder, like: i wonder if that guy thinks i\u2019m a total dick", "but it just so happens your cat got run over by a car, and your kid pissed on your trousers before you had to go to an important meeting, and then your wife called and was really upset", "and then some guy dropped your coffee on the floor and you\u2019re just in a shitty mood and that person happens to come up to you as you\u2019re running to the gate to catch a flight that you\u2019re going to miss", "and they have a 30 second exposure to you in a really rare off moment and they\u2019re like: wow, that guy is an asshole", "or you literally just sprained your wrist grabbing through a suitcase", "i had that happen on this last trip", "and then someone comes up to you right at that moment and says: hey, i\u2019m a big fan", "i\u2019m like, this is a really strange thing to say; i\u2019m in a lot of pain right now", "they\u2019re like: yeah, i met that guy; he made put the most ridiculous story", "he blamed it on his wrist", "i had this experience yesterday, which was hilarious and infuriating at the same time", "this is yet another reason to stay off social media", "i saw this guy who i suppose you could call him a journalist or a media producer who i had been pinging me via text message for awhile", "i\u2019d been traveling out of the country, this and that", "it\u2019s like: get together, have drinks, and like: hey buddy, how\u2019s it going", "i guess i didn\u2019t reply to them", "so his tweet was, \u201ctim ferriss is like an arrogant, self centered ass but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn lessons from him.\u201d and i was like: oh, so this is what happens when i\u2019m out of the country for two months and miss someone\u2019s text; they assume malice", "i remember a piece of advice i was given, or read at some point \u2013 i mix those up \u2013 and i\u2019ve modified it a bit: never attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence", "now, the way i\u2019ve modified that is: never attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or business", "it\u2019s just like you don\u2019t know what battle someone else is fighting", "they might come off as a dick and it\u2019s like \u2013 i\u2019m not going to give away too much in the movie but it\u2019s like something catastrophic could have happened that they\u2019re not being open about because they don\u2019t want to be open about it", "just assume that it\u2019s not a personal attack", "but i\u2019m getting up on a soapbox; let me chill myself out", "i think that\u2019s good advice", "you\u2019ve done 100 cities", "do you have a favorite meal that comes to mind", "and maybe it\u2019s pizza; could be but is there a favorite meal or drink of yours that comes to mind", "i think some combination", "i love great macaroni and cheese", "i love going to the fanciest restaurant you can imagine and just ordering macaroni and cheese, or ordering the hamburger", "because i always find that if you go to someplace that\u2019s $50 a plate or something like that, sure you can order the chicken or the steak or whatever but man, can they make a hamburger", "now, is that for your joy or is it remotely flawed with the kitchen", "no, i\u2019m not trying to blame the system", "so you\u2019re not asking for super well done, because i know that makes chefs completely insane", "no, no", "i think it\u2019s a cuisine loophole", "it\u2019s a great secret in cuisine which is that you order the kind of inexpensive pedestrian item on a really expensive, fancy menu is more often than not amazing", "if you\u2019re in a fancy restaurant and for whatever reason there\u2019s peanut butter and jelly on the menu, order the peanut butter and jelly because those people aren\u2019t fucking around", "god, i love it", "no, that\u2019s good advice", "i remember i had two different pieces of advice from two very good chefs", "one said if you go out to a restaurant, never have the roast chicken because you can always make roast chicken at home", "yes, i think that\u2019s smart", "you can always make it at home", "but i had someone else say if you can get roast chicken on the menu at a fancy restaurant, get the roast chicken because everyone an make it at home; you think you know roast chicken", "this may be along the lines of the pb&j; order the pb&j", "if you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say", "i\u2019d put it in times square and it would say, \u201cnone of these companies care about you.\u201d ooh, i like it", "that\u2019s one of the things that i feel like i\u2019ve learned over the years, which is that we\u2019ve come to trust corporations in a certain sense and we forget the fact that they actually have no vested interest in us other than our money", "which harkens back to the thing i was saying about gatekeepers", "i have very much of a niched career", "i have a career where if people know my work, more often than not, they\u2019re like: that\u2019s great, i\u2019m a huge fan, this is great what you do", "but most people don\u2019t know who i am", "it\u2019s the definition of niche", "i don\u2019t get stopped in the street almost ever, which is great; it\u2019s phenomenal", "and so in relation to that, i do things that are self produced", "i\u2019m a producer on my movies, i\u2019m a producer on my one man shows, i produced my tour; it\u2019s all in house and i try not to bow to the gatekeepers of show business because they don\u2019t care about me", "they really don\u2019t", "the networks and the studios, all they care about is whether or not my movie or my tv show or whatever it would be would make them money", "so why would i try to please those people", "the people i\u2019m trying to please is my audience", "they\u2019re the people who buy my albums or go buy movie tickets", "those are the people i care about; those are the people i\u2019m making movies for", "so my billboard is these companies don\u2019t care about you", "do you have any other rules that you\u2019ve developed for\u2026 i was going to say the business side of the art that you\u2019re involved with but just in terms of managing your life and career, are there any other rules you\u2019ve set for yourself that have helped you to have the success and longevity that you\u2019ve had", "i think my advice is just to try to figure out what they do well in the system; the studio system, the network system and just pull it out and replicate the parts that you think work and then do the rest yourself", "my first off broadway show was sleepwalk with me, and it was very much by the book", "it was produced in this way, the off broadway system", "it had a general manager and a general management company that took such and such a fee, and it had this many people who are on the payroll and all this kind of stuff", "and my agent and i, after the fact because the show, even though it was this big success and it ran for eight months, the show technically \u2013 this is a very common thing in hollywood \u2013 it lost money, technically", "i guess the most famous story of this is the simpsons", "the simpsons franchise, i don\u2019t know if this is true still but a few years ago, it was not in profit", "have you ever heard that story", "i haven\u2019t heard the story of the simpsons but i\u2019ve read some articles on hollywood accounting", "hollywood accounting is crazy; it\u2019s bananas", "it\u2019s completely bonkers", "it\u2019s on par with \u2013 i\u2019m making this up; i don\u2019t know if this is accurate so don\u2019t sue me, gm but when people are like: oh yeah, gm paid no taxes last year, or apple paid no taxes last year", "and you\u2019re like: what", "it\u2019s absolutely on par where you\u2019re like: oh, the movie grossed a billion dollars but no one saw any back end participation mysteriously for these various reasons that are detailed in this article", "but no, i haven\u2019t heard the simpsons example", "another example is my last movie, sleepwalk with me, i won\u2019t name the names involved but it didn\u2019t technically make money, even though it did like 2.25 at the box office which is a lot for a small film that was made for $1 million", "and then it did probably a million whatever \u2013 maybe more \u2013 digitally on netflix and itunes and all these things", "and so it quote-unquote made somewhere between 3 and 5 million dollars", "we made it for a million dollars\u2019 budget, which is like nothing in the world of independent film", "yeah, super budget", "and the movie didn\u2019t make money", "i\u2019m trying not to curse but it doesn\u2019t fucking make sense", "it doesn\u2019t make sense at all", "and so this time around, i was like: alright, i\u2019m going to cut out all the people who charged the movie, so to speak, and became like a line item in the budget for the marketing and the distribution of the movie and i\u2019m just going to do it myself", "so don\u2019t think twice is essentially self distributed in cooperation with this company, the film arcade, which is a small distribution company that i basically told my story to", "and we\u2019re like, let\u2019s build this from scratch", "i\u2019ll go from town to town, i\u2019ll go to 30 cities and i\u2019ll hand deliver this movie", "so my whole summer has been me going town to town showing sneak previews of the movie and then doing a free improv workshop for improv theaters in that town", "so we\u2019re going to io in chicago, and ucb in new york, and the torch theater in phoenix, the planet ant theater in detroit which is where keegan-michael key started", "and we\u2019re doing these free workshops as an act of good will", "because basically, we thought why don\u2019t we, instead of buying a ton of tv ads and this and that, all the traditional marketing, why don\u2019t we spend that money just having me be a walking billboard for the movie and go town to town and spread good will", "say: hey, we\u2019re going to do free improv workshops, we\u2019re going to give out free tickets to local improv theaters and we\u2019re going to do q&as", "so to get back to what you\u2019re saying in a business sense, i would say steal the ideas that corporations use that work and then fill in the rest yourself", "steal the thunder from the gods", "yes, exactly", "it doesn\u2019t actually belong to them anyway, in a lot of senses", "i\u2019m really excited about that", "i\u2019m continually excited about this type of experiment, and particularly given my experience with the podcast, which after many, many years is really the first, in a sense aside from the blog and so on, the first free agent enterprise that i\u2019ve had complete unilateral creative control over", "the indoctrination of podcasts has been incredible for radio", "it\u2019s such a boon and such a joy", "and for that reason, i\u2019m going to be experimenting with a lot of different approaches with publishing as it relates to books and otherwise", "because every time i have in the past let someone pay for something, which is usually bloated in some capacity as you mentioned\u2026 the whole publishing industry is bloated", "you will not have the control or the protections you would want as a doer", "so how can people see the frequently, infrequently, or moderately", "and of course, it\u2019s kind of contingent, i suppose, upon when people are hearing this but how would you like people to check it out", "i have really been enjoying it; chris sacca loved it", "i\u2019ve heard great things from a number of different people and i certainly recommend people check it out", "but where can they learn more and see more", "there\u2019s a site called don\u2019tthinktwicemovie.com, the twitter handle @dontthink", "my twitter handle is @birbigs, b-i-r-b-i-g-s", "i\u2019m traveling [01:30:00] around the country, so like 30 cities; with people\u2019s help, don\u2019t think twice will get into 300 to 500 theaters across the country, and maybe more", "but it\u2019s entirely contingent to the people listening to this", "i\u2019m at nantucket film festival right now, and there are great movies", "there\u2019s this documentary called tickle, that\u2019s phenomenal", "there\u2019s this movie called other people, that chris kelly made", "there\u2019s captain fantastic, which i was telling you about", "there\u2019s a norman leer documentary", "there are so many great independent films", "and what i urge people to do is go to your local cinema, and see small films", "read a few reviews and go to the ones you think might work for you", "it really does help for there to be more of them", "no one\u2019s getting rich on an independent film but if the movie makes a few million dollars, i\u2019ll get to make another movie and i\u2019ll put my heart and soul into it", "so that\u2019s what i would ask", "just for people who are wondering, those people who have been listening to me or following me long enough know this, that i take endorsing things very, very seriously", "it\u2019s very easy to destroy a reputation that takes a long time to build", "i feel very comfortable recommending this movie", "when i was watching it earlier with cal, at one point a few minutes into it, he said, \u201cwait a second", "is this documentary or script?\u201d great", "that is just about the highest compliment as it relates to acting that appears completely natural", "i thought to myself, wow, that is a very rare comment", "and this is coming from someone who\u2019s had a lot of immersion in the arts and entertainment, also", "that\u2019s a huge compliment, thank you", "yes, so everybody definitely check it out and i will put all of the links in the show notes, as usual, at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "two last questions", "this one is what is the best or most worthwhile investment you\u2019ve ever made", "that could be time, money, energy and just as an example to buy a little time, amelia boone, who has been on the podcast, she\u2019s won the world\u2019s toughest mudder three times and is the most successful female obstacle courser in the world", "her answer to me was paying her first $450 entrance fee, which was a stretch at the time, for world\u2019s toughest mudder", "so it seemed like a huge stretch but it completely set her on \u2013 pun intended \u2013 this course in her life", "she\u2019s also a power attorney at apple and just a complete machine", "what would you offer as your answer to that", "i would say spend $15.00 on a yoga class", "i started doing yoga two years ago and if i hadn\u2019t started, i feel like my body would have broken down completely and i\u2019d be in a sling", "my wife convinced me to do yoga after years of telling me that i should do yoga, which is hilarious if you people don\u2019t have the visual picture of me", "or they might, but you wouldn\u2019t think of me as someone who does yoga", "and i certainly don\u2019t do it well", "but if you can find a good place for beginners, oh, my god, i find it to be completely helpful for being productive and being healthy", "i think people are as old as their joints feel so if you sit down a lot, it is good to stretch", "i\u2019ve been doing a lot of acro yoga for the last two years and my hips and back have never felt better", "that\u2019s great", "so i would also encourage people that if for whatever reason you can\u2019t get tickets to standup comedy by mr", "birbigs, if you see him in line for a yoga class and want to get some indirect comedy by watching his downward dog and cobra poses, then that is much like the culinary loophole you talked about earlier", "i\u2019ll tell you this is going to sound like i\u2019m kissing up but my wife urged me to wedge this in somehow, which is if the people just listen to the podcast and they don\u2019t have your book, get your four hour workweek, i believe your first book", "that\u2019s the first book, yes", "which is how i was introduced to your work", "because i have a completely different outlook on vacation now", "the way that you talk about essentially we\u2019re working these 80 hour weeks, let\u2019s say, for this pie in the sky idea of retirement at the end of our lives that god knows what the hell that even is anyway", "and live that retirement in fits and spurts in the middle of your life so you understand the perspective of what that even is", "and because of that, my wife and i took a vacation to laguna beach where i shut off my computer for five days at the beginning of june and it\u2019s literally because of your book", "thank you for sharing that", "that makes my day", "and laguna beach is a great choice; that\u2019s a beautiful spot", "i searched all over", "i\u2019m an amateur travel agent", "for those people who haven\u2019t read the book, the balloon payment at the end for the deferred life plan is far from guaranteed", "far from guaranteed", "far from guaranteed so it\u2019s good to break up the work with many retirements for sure", "is there any ask or request as we wrap up, any parting comments or asks or requests from my audience", "no, just follow the movie @dontthinkmovie on twitter or follow me @birbigs on twitter", "trust me that the movie is really good and i think you\u2019ll laugh, and i think you might cry", "take someone on a date, take a few of your friends", "there\u2019s a lot of love that went into making something that a lot of people so far have liked", "so yeah, it would just mean a lot to me", "it also supports an ecosystem of creators creating, which i\u2019m extremely passionate about and i think pretty well informed regarding", "i would tell people every time i have to or choose to review something, whether it\u2019s a book or a movie or anything else, right before an interview i\u2019m always nervous", "and i\u2019m just like: oh, god, am i going to have to tap dance around the fact that i didn\u2019t like something, by the glaring omission of mentioning it or anything like that", "and within five minutes of putting this on, i was like: oh, thank fucking god, i don\u2019t have to deal with any of that", "it was such a wash of relief", "so i do encourage people to check it out", "and mike, i know you\u2019ve got a lot going on right now", "you\u2019re juggling all of the activities that go with taking matters into your own hands with a creative endeavor like this", "so i certainly send good vibes to you for the endurance and courage and strength that you will need on the road", "thank you", "this is great fun so i really appreciate you taking the time", "thanks, and as a disclaimer to anybody who\u2019s listening to this and going: i don\u2019t even like mike birbiglia\u2019s comedy; why am i listening to him talk about it, just know on a lot of days, i don\u2019t like it either", "so i might be wrong about everything i\u2019ve just said but i\u2019m just trying my best like anybody else", "that\u2019s all we can ask, man", "everybody\u2019s just trying to get by, one day at a time", "yes", "mike, best of luck with everything and to everyone listening, as always, i\u2019ll mention it again: you can find links to everything, including the movie, including social, including books and dvds and so on that came up in the show notes as well as those notes for every other episode at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "and until next time and as always, thank you for listening"]}
