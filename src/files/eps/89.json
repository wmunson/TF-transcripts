ferriss: hello, ladies and germs. this is tim ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show, where i deconstruct world-class performers to tease out and pull out the routines, the habits, the breakfasts, the favorite books, the behaviors and so on that you can use in your own life, borrow from these individuals who have achieved the pinnacle of whatever their chosen field might be, whether that's chess, hedge fund managing, sports, acting, government, you name it, military, it goes on and on. and in this particular episode, we have a foursome that is very exciting, folks, and i was very nervous about the tech in managing all of the cables and so on, but it turned out even better than i could have possibly hoped. it was after a workout with these people who all could kick my ass in so many ways it is impossible to count, and that is a good thing because if you are the strongest person in the room, if you are the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.   and we have three people.   so we have first laird hamilton, who is widely considered the greatest big-wave surfer of all time. he is also a very innovative influencer in modern board sports and surfing, so he is considered either the creator or certainly popularizer of tow-in surfing, which allows him and now many, many other people to surf waves bigger than ever before possible and is largely responsible for the rebirth of standup paddle boarding. if you've seen people stand up paddle boarding, chances are on some level you have laird to thank for it. laird has starred in many surfing films and was the centerpiece of riding giants, a documentary about big-wave surfing, which if you have not seen, you have to see. it will make your palms sweat within the first few minutes. it's insanity. and he's also considered the rider of the heaviest wave of all time, or at least at the time that surfing magazine had him on the cover, and the only caption was, \"oh, my god.\"    so he's been a contributing editor for men's journal; he's been on oprah, charlie rose, 60 minutes, the ellen degeneres show, and he's also very well known, and i admire larry for this, for using his lifestyle and his skillset to raise money for charities, including race across america, pipeline for a cure for cystic fibrosis, raincatcher, and muscular dystrophy, et cetera. he's an awesome dude.  and the only person perhaps as intimidatingly awesome is his wife, gabrielle reece. gabby has been named one of the 20 most influential women in sports and is best known for her fantastic success in volleyball; but she's of course also done model, she's had starring roles as a trainer on the biggest loser, and reece is just incredible. and i've had a chance to work out with gabby. she is every bit as incredible as laird, and they're both about a foot taller than i am, but let's not go there. that's okay. i feel okay in my gnomish-like stature.   in any case, gabby has also used her crossover success in these different fields to become the first female athlete to ever design a shoe for nike, and she now serves as a fitness expert for yahoo! health, among many, many other things.   the last person in our little menage-a-four - i don't know how to say that in french - is brian mackenzie. he is the founder of crossfit endurance and the author of the new york times best-selling book unbreakable runner. brian has created a lot of controversy, and he was featured in the four hour body for a lot of it, by suggesting a very counterintuitive approach to distance running, in which he challenges high-mileage runs, high-carb diets, and incorporates a lot of intense strength training, in some cases very brief strength training to conquer everything from 5ks to ultra-marathons. and many of you out there have used his protocol, his sort of 8-week to 12-week protocol in four hour body to go from running nothing to running marathons and ultra-marathons in record time.   so congratulations.   and laird, for those of you who didn't see it, was also one of my surfing coaches in the tim ferriss experiment, so just check that out, itunes.com/timferriss, two rs and two ss. and without further ado, here is laird, gabby, and brian.   guys, welcome to the show. i'm so thrilled to have you guys here. and i thought that we could just start off with a description of what just happened because i came in here this morning terrified of this workout - and brian had something else in mind. and i came out of the workout really exhausted, feeling great, and having done things in the workout i didn't think i was capable of. and i was hoping, laird, maybe you could just describe the training a little bit.  laird hamilton: that seems like a perfect scenario.  tim ferriss: no, i was very surprised.  laird hamilton: yeah, it did all those things. well, ultimately i think it's about challenging your beliefs, but also challenging your - you know, your physicality.    so, i mean, within that scenario of, you know, the things that we've done, which we're thermo-regulating the heat, the ice, the pool, the lack of breath, the effort of swimming and jumping and, you know, all the physical stuff, i mean, there's just so many things happening simultaneously, i think it really is about just complete confusion.  tim ferriss: yeah. and what i also realized, for those people that are not familiar with laird's pool - and why would you be - there are stairs. there's a staircase built into the middle of the pool so that people can walk down, but then you might thing, well, wouldn't you just float up to the surface? but you have everyone weighed down with giant dumbbells.  laird hamilton: with giant dumbbells. well, it's got a set of steps that brings you into the pool; these are steps that are underwater in the middle of the pool.  tim ferriss: correct. yeah, correct. and what i realized -  laird hamilton: for when it's empty.  tim ferriss: right. so you can do your workouts in the pool and -  laird hamilton: it's that far down.  tim ferriss: so gabby, you gave me some very good advice. i just remember holding dumbbells and you were like, \"your eyes don't need to be as wide open.\" i just looked like, i don't know, a cat in a corner i guess probably, bug-eyed. and faster is not better, and i was hoping maybe you could just elaborate on that because i think it's a really interesting concept that translates not just to the workout in the pool but to a lot of things.  gabrielle reece: well, we were just saying that earlier, that it's very true to life that it is more about with purpose and with a calm manner at times can actually be more effective. and so the water really exaggerates all of that and also forces you to sort of yield to that method. and so really just looking around takes up oxygen, and so - and actually you did very well today, so you have to give yourself some credit. but a lot of times we're so focused and our eyes open, like when you play land sports and you go to focus, you do open your eyes.    it's a focus mechanism, right?  tim ferriss: right.  gabrielle reece: but in the pool it's quite opposite where you have to relax everything that you can relax so all the air goes to the places that are doing the work.  tim ferriss: right, your eyes, your jaw, everything has to relax.  gabrielle reece: everything. and then it's moving in a way that it's what amount of oxygen are you giving up for the amount of effort you're putting in and finding that sort of sweet spot of this effort, especially when you're not doing like really heavy, heavy weight and it's more about the breath-holding.  tim ferriss: definitely. and i was - you know, brian, we were chatting a couple days ago when i was doing one of my usual walks in san francisco, and you got me very excited about the pool training, obviously. and rick, who we both know, rick ruben, who's been on the podcast, has talked about this. you were talking about using the mask that i now have, as well as this training. and when i asked you what you were most excited about these days, one of the answers was the breath training.   and i'd just love to hear what you were doing with the breath training, some of the results you've seen, because it's such a fundamental aspect of all life and sports. but having been exposed to like wim hof and somebody that's sort of come to the forefront of my mind, but this is my first time ever really playing around with it, of doing an exhale, then trying to swim lengths of a pool, which is completely different. but what has been your experience and how are you doing some of that training? brian mackenzie: well, i first was given that training mask by a buddy of mine named ki.tim ferriss: elevation training mask.  brian mackenzie: yeah, elevation training mask. and, you know, i looked at it and i was a little weirded out by it; but with anything i get, i'm like i'm going to screw around with it, and if it makes sense for me to screw around with it, i'll continue to screw around with it. if it doesn't, i'll toss it. and i immediately got a response out of my diaphragm like when i took a breath.  tim ferriss: had to use your diaphragm.  brian mackenzie: had to use my diaphragm.  tim ferriss: and for those people who don't have the visual, the mask, i guess it looks almost like a mask you could use - right, a mask for construction; you have the ventilation. you can change the amount of airflow that's permitted.  brian mackenzie: correct. so their whole scheme is from like 3,000 feet to 18,000 feet, and you can change all of those settings. laird likes to play around with it a little further, which is typical, which is good, you know.  tim ferriss: that's so unlike him.  brian mackenzie: hey, i know, it's very unlike him. so anyway, i got a quick understanding of this mask, and i saw something that i have seen fault him with every athlete i've really ever worked with, is like when you see a spinal fault or you see a mechanical fault -  tim ferriss: fault meaning their posture is off.  brian mackenzie: yeah, posture is off, position is off. so if i'm - and i'm making a quarter extremity violation, i am literally probably most likely making that fault with spinal mechanics.  tim ferriss: a quarter extremity violation meaning one of your limbs is doing something funny?  brian mackenzie: now your limb is actually compensating for making up for the lack of stability that's going on here. so think of being overextended or being flexed too far forward. if i flex too far forward, i run into a wall when i breathe. if i overextend, i run into a wall when i'm breathing. if i don't, i can breathe.iand this showed me immediately that i could get people who did not understand this concept, which is a very hard thing to come by - i mean, we could talk about it right now, and people are probably like, okay, whatever, you know. but if i put the mask on, i immediately go to my nose, so i'm using my nose to breathe, which is, yes, you should be drawing in your breath for most of your breathing through your nose, and you're forcing that diaphragm to work. so getting that concept down and then being introduced to laird and gabby through my friend ki, i came up here. and it was just - it's exactly like laird said; you know, it's mask infusion. we're kind of tossing the entire nuts and bolts at you, and then it's exactly as gabby is explaining in the fact that it's like, look, you actually have to be conscious of what's really going on and controlled and like, hey, where are you focused?    the energy of, \"oh, my god,\" that facial expression it literally costing you energy. that costs.  tim ferriss: that costs you reps, yeah. that can cost you reps.  gabrielle reece: or getting to the other side and then all your friends see you not make it.  tim ferriss: and this has made more sense to me in being not only somebody who is a competitor swimmer, somebody who's a coach, somebody who's worked - i specialize in movement, but you have to work - you will get efficient in that pool very quickly.  brian mackenzie: right, because all of the - any energy leak is exaggerated.  tim ferriss: yes.  brian mackenzie: and just so people have a visual once again, the first exercise we did in the pool, i guess i had - i want to say started with 15-pound weights, dumbbells, and then moved up. but you're sort of sinking to the bottom of the pool and then doing a shoulder press as you jump up to the surface of the pool, and then you're bringing your arms down to your sides, almost like you're swimming a stroke, like a jumping jack in a big circle.  that's when you take the breath at the top. and so immediately i was like, oh, i'm holding my breath underwater, but i have to start exhaling as soon as i go underwater; otherwise, i'm going to have to exhale and inhale at the top, and that's when i'm going to swallow water.tim ferriss: and it's also going to shorten your amount of air you can get in if you have to blow out, which is all, again, counterintuitive.   [overlapping comments]  tim ferriss: the learning curve was so fascinating to me because, even after 10 reps or 15 reps, i was like, oh, that thing that i was freaking out about on rep three or four, completely unnecessary, right? and then, gabby, i think you mentioned this to me as i was doing one of the exercises i was even more terrified of, which was holding a dumbbell to my chest and swimming underwater back and forth.  brian mackenzie: ammo box.  tim ferriss: the ammo box. is if you feel like you can't make it, exhale a little bit, which is so counterintuitive.  gabrielle reece: i know. and you make room, too.  brian mackenzie: yeah. well, it also gives you time because your brain goes, well, i'm exhaling, i'm going to be inhaling.   so your brain, again, it's a bit of a confusion, like you confuse yourself. you confuse your instincts, right, like the breath-holding exhale drill. you want to breathe in. as soon as you exhale, you have a mechanism that's designed to breathe in because you have pressure on the diaphragm. you want to breathe in. but once you teach the body to resist against that and know it's okay, that you're not going to breathe in right now because you still have the oxygen, then it leads you to a new place.  tim ferriss: and what is - now, we've drained these glasses. but laird, can you elaborate on this very potent yellow elixir?  gabrielle reece: it's good, isn't it?  tim ferriss: it is good.   [overlapping comments] tim ferriss: so we were doing the in-pool exercises and then we would do ice bath for at least three months and then about 15 minutes' minimum in the hot box. so i was about to take - i felt like i was ready for a nap, and then i had this magic concoction. what is in this beverage?  laird hamilton: well, that was fresh-squeezed turmeric root.  tim ferriss: yeah, and you have a whole box of this turmeric root.  gabrielle reece: it was sent from kauai, but you can get it at the store.  laird hamilton: but fresh-squeezed turmeric root, liquid pepper extract, and then raw honey and apple cider vinegar.  gabrielle reece: and water.  laird hamilton: that was fully diluted, by the way.  tim ferriss: no, that's intense, yeah, but i really enjoyed it. and you also showed me something earlier, which is about the size of a large cat. it is a mushroom. what type of mushroom is this?  laird hamilton: yeah, it's called a chaga.  tim ferriss: chaga. pretty uncommon, hard to find from what i understand.  laird hamilton: yeah, rare more because it's unknown, but also its uniqueness of the habitat it comes from and then the ability to use it.   most people just don't know about it, so it's - but it's the most powerful mushroom in the world. they say the spores are found in the stratosphere. they found chaga spores like in the stratosphere in space.  gabrielle reece: well, isn't it the only mushroom, too, that grows on a living organism?  laird hamilton: yes. yeah. and doesn't take from it. it's not living -  brian mackenzie: it's not a parasite, yeah.  laird hamilton: it's actually supplying - tim ferriss: a symbiotic relationship. i think today's show, the theme for me has just been fear so far, my own fear. so i'd love to talk about that just a little bit. all three of you i think have sort of befriended fear in some ways. so gabby, when you were competing, or even now, obviously world-class athlete, what was your self-talk like before a big match or before a big event?   how do you prepare yourself for that?laird hamilton: i'm not going to answer for her, but i want to preface, i want to help you out with the question because i met gabby on a show called the extremist, and she was the host when i met her. and she came to interview me, and she'd already interviewed like 60 other people and gotten an aspect of their sport. so for her, before a match in volleyball, like i respect that as an athlete, but for her to go out and jump out of a plane, to go hang-gliding, riding on some crazy dragster bike, i mean, these are - because you're going into - i think, i mean, you can ask her the question; she can answer it instead of me. but ultimately ask her the question of what was heavier, like before a big match that you were going to play or like get on a drag bike that you'd never been on and release the clutch and go zero to 60 in a second.  tim ferriss: no, that's helpful. that's very helpful.   so i feel like even more of a weakling and coward than i did before i asked the question, but let me -  gabrielle reece: i have to say that when you practice many hours and you dedicate a lot of time to something, it does have a different value. you know, if i was doing mtv sports or the extremist, there was a margin of \u00f4i'm going to do the best i can.' and certainly, you know, laird always jokes that if there's like something on the line, then i'm very good, like really focused. like if you said to me, \"hey, gabrielle, let's go for a mountain bike ride and we're going to go for like three hours, it's totally routed and extreme downhill,\" i'd be like \u00f4i'm good.' but if you said, hey, there's this point and purpose, i would do it then. so i'm a little different that way.  tim ferriss: you need the stakes or the incentive.  gabrielle reece: kind of. and that's maybe not great actually, to be honest with you. so volleyball, i had a different emotional attachment because i invested a lot of time and it meant a lot to me. so i had a different expectation going into it.  i would kind of go through a ritual that would get me into a different head space where i was switching from, you know, me as a person to me the competitor, but -  tim ferriss: what did the ritual look like?  gabrielle reece: you know, it was sort of like the hair goes up in a ponytail and then you start putting sunblock on and then i'd clean my glasses, i'd put those on. it was all very thought out. i would detach away from everyone except my teammates.  tim ferriss: how long did that pre-game ritual last?  gabrielle reece: i didn't need long, like maybe 15, 20 minutes. i was superstitious, too. i would never compete in the color red. if i wore something and played badly, i would not use that visor or hair tie or pair of glasses again. so i did have those weird things; but i think like any athlete will tell you, there are certain things that i wish i had been better at. it took me - i think having children has made me less concerned with making everybody happy. and i think even when i was competing; i was really concerned about how people felt.    so that was hard because it's hard to try to be, oh, you're trying to kick ass, but then you're worried about how people feel. it's a wide dynamic. so i would change personality, but i will truthfully say that i also - i think i held myself back.  tim ferriss: so coming back to the parenting comment, so having kids has made you care less about what people think?  gabrielle reece: well, you just straight get meaner because you have no time.  tim ferriss: to people outside of your kids or to the kids also?  gabrielle reece: everybody.  tim ferriss: okay.  gabrielle reece: no, i think - no, because we have less time. and also as a woman, we're taught as young girls, hey, be nice, nice girls act like this. and so it takes a long time to get to a place to go, okay, i'm going to do things, say things, and believe in things that people aren't going to like, and i'm going to be okay with that. it takes - men do that so much easier, and it takes women a very long time. and the only athletes i've seen that do it very easily are generally the youngest girl with all older brothers.   they understand it's not personal much sooner than girls. and so, you know - and the other thing i would say is i wasn't really groomed to be a champion. like terry walsh, for example, her whole life was groomed. she was told at an early age you're a winner, you can win, it's okay to win, expect to win. i fell into winning and learning to win, and so that was another thing i had to overcome.  tim ferriss: how did you fall into winning?  gabrielle reece: by being really tall and being decently athletic and getting into sports.  tim ferriss: but you didn't have the sort of familial support?  gabrielle reece: i didn't at all, and i was a late bloomer and all these things. so it was all like, well, is it okay to win and like it's kind of going good. like it was all that weird sort of things that you had to overcome. so i think there are a lot of things you learn, and children put things into real perspective for you. age puts things into perspective, and those usually happen kind of simultaneous. and again, you have less time, so you kind of cut through the crap.  tim ferriss: brian, so you've worked with a lot of athletes.   you know a lot of world-class coaches, and you've traveled a ton. when you think of the word \"successful,\" who is the first person that comes to mind?  brian mackenzie: well, these two are easily at that list.  gabrielle reece: that's because we're sitting here.  brian mackenzie: well, you asked the question and i'm sitting in front of two -  gabrielle reece: how about his wife? he has a badass wife.  brian mackenzie: my wife, you know.   [overlapping comments]  tim ferriss: so what are the characteristics? why do you -  brian mackenzie: without knowing who they were or what they - i knew who laird was, i knew who gabby was. but irrelevant to the situation in what i was brought into and how i met them, and at the top of that sits happiness. you take away the financial side of stuff, you take away the extreme, you take away the - like, hey, i was at the pinnacle of sport, like i was - you know, i was world-class athlete. you take that away, and you see how a dynamic is working and you see how people are functioning. and they're happy, they're surrounded by people who are happy. they are - it's an ecosystem in itself. so i think that's - you know, it's easy to just say that because they're sitting right here, you know, and because it's the truth. you know, i know plenty of people like that, but i also know plenty of people that are miserable, that, you know, you would say, oh, they're so successful, and it's like, hmm, what do you consider -  tim ferriss: yeah, right. if you use the bank account maybe.  brian mackenzie: yeah, the bank account or like - even like just behavior, like behavior of like i'm threatened by you, i'm insecure about this. it's like, yeah, you've got some stuff to work on still. i'm not in a situation like i've got to exit from this. it just doesn't work enough for me.  tim ferriss: so happiness, let's talk about that for a second because one thing that really struck me and why i like hanging out with you guys also and wanted to hang out more was when i was filming for the tim ferriss experiment we did this surfing episode, which was a blast. and thank you guys both for putting up with me for that period of time, putting up with me now also.   but the memory that comes to me when people are like, oh, what was it like hanging out with them, and it's the time at home when you were joking around with the kids and like doing the steam baths and the ice baths. i was like, you know, it's not just the really, really, really good athletes who had maintained an unbelievable level of physical performance; it's that you seem to have a very kind of integrated life as spouses and then with the kids. but you obviously had some challenges growing up.   it wasn't easy. what have you, laird, like how have you guys thought about parenting and what you are trying to do differently with your kids?  laird hamilton: well, i think for everyone you maybe want to be the parent that you didn't have or maybe you want to be the parent you think you wanted. you know, you also - of course, depending on the relationship with your parents, if you had an incredible one, then you want to try to be the parent that you had. so there was parents i - you know, some of the parents i had were parents i did want to be and some of the parents i had were parents i didn't want to be. and so, you know, you try to - you know, you try to do the best you can. i mean, you go from your instincts; you go from your heart. i mean, when you really look at it, when i - if i look at the most important thing for me in parenting, being parented as a young child was being loved. it was like being loved was probably - and if i can just - you know, loving your children can override a lot of wrongs.tim ferriss: yeah. how do you demonstrate that? it sounds like a weird question, but i know a lot of smart people who are just not good parents. they try, but they're not good.  gabrielle reece: we do it different. so like, for example, reece, our middle daughter who is more similar to laird and very emotional, she would be going through something.  laird hamilton: thank you.  gabrielle reece: no, she is. straight up.  laird hamilton: and our younger daughter more similar to gabby is a ruthless killer.  gabrielle reece: true. anyway, so reece would be like upset about something, and i'd be like, well, let's talk about it, how are you feeling, what's going on, you know. laird would walk in the room, kind of take one look at her and just grab her and put her on the floor and hug her, right? and so i think one thing that we've learned is we try our best to be an ally friend. we never let the kids feel like they can wedge between us ever. so that's very helpful. and i think, believe it or not, laird is more touchy-feely, love them, you know.  laird hamilton: well, they're also girls. i mean, if we had some sons, you might be - there might be a different relationship. gabrielle reece: maybe, that's true.  laird hamilton: because it's male-female. daddy's little girls and mommy's little boys. it's just the nature of the dynamic. i mean, i had a mother that i had an incredible relationship with, and you just have that male-female connection.  gabrielle reece: yeah. so i think you have that, and then, you know, i make sure like i understand the nuances, like their favorite - they need this certain clothing and like lessons and then they can talk to me about their girl stuff. and, you know, they know i'm not going to surprise them.  laird hamilton: but we're inclusive, too, and we treat them like adults. we've always spoken to them like adults. we treat them like an adultyou know, where they say treat them like an honored guest if they don't act like one, you know, but ultimately we treat them, we take them with us. when we go, we all go together.iand when we go to eat somewhere, i mean, we go to dinner parties where no one brings their kids, but we bring our kids because they're just - otherwise we don't go. and people that invite us know that, hey, if they come, they're coming.  gabrielle reece: it's our family. and we're tough on them. we're tough on them. we're -  tim ferriss: in what ways are you tough on them?  gabrielle reece: i mean, we're just - like if they do something that could be perceived as not using really good judgment, there's no like, well, honey, you know we don't do that in this house. it's straight up like \u00f4what are you doing?' you know, so i think there's a direct - we have a very direct style of parenting, which thank goodness our children are a certain way because for me personally my kids are very stubborn and strong-willed and everything else. but it would be much harder for me if i had a kid that was - that i'd have to coddle more because i don't know that verbiage as well. but listen, i've had to say i'm sorry many times. that's another thing you learn as a parent, you have to learn to say sorry because you blow it.   so you can - sometimes you can go, hey, you know what, i am extra tired today and my fuse is short and i am being unfair to you, and i'm sorry. like you have to learn that you're imperfect and kind of open that door up, too. like there are times that you go, hey - you know, i always say to my girls do you feel loved enough, you know, because you want to know. and they're like, oh, come on, mom. but i think you should ask.  tim ferriss: yeah. well, just asking says a lot, right? even if they like brush it off, like i would imagine kids -  laird hamilton: well, it's also respect. by asking them, respect. and also you're showing them it's okay to not be perfect because we're not perfect either. so we're not demanding some perfect out of them which is totally unattainable. who can do that?  gabrielle reece: but having said that, like right now our almost 20-year-old daughter, she doesn't love us right now. straight up, like she doesn't - she's not loving us right now. so okay. so it's not like ooh, la, la, la.  laird hamilton: and it's interesting, brian's comment talking about, you know, having that happiness or contentment is a sign of success. and i always said as a parent, to be a successful parent would be that you could raise a content human because i don't know that many.   so if you could actually be a parent that raises a content human, good parenting.  tim ferriss: yeah. and what i've also noticed, just with you guys - and then, brian, i want to get your take on a bunch of things - is that you have - you mentioned the kind of wrestling to the ground. you have a very physical relationship with your kids. and i think it's - no, no, no, but it's like it's a very - as someone who's only recently gotten back into physical play, doing stuff like yoga, it's been incredibly effective at anxiety reduction, relaxation, and just feeling grounded and connected to other people. so i think that that's also something that has struck me, is just how you use a lot of physical interaction with your kids.  gabrielle reece: but think about hawaii, too. like if you - if my kids are here and you go to leave, they're going to get up and walk you to the door and say goodbye. in hawaii, when you see an auntie or an uncle, you give them a hug.   there's a touching component of like tactile and think about even animals, right? like if my kid does something, i'm going to grab her arm. like even if it's, you know, physical in play, but it's just physical like we're connecting.  laird hamilton: and i also think that the physical is a reflection of the emotional, you know, because if you do yoga and it's an intense position and you're having all this stuff, but this is for spiritual enlightenment. this is to come to a higher level of consciousness, but it's a physical act. so in a way, this physical relationship we have makes them mentally stronger, makes them mentally - you know, all these things are just reflection, these physical reflections of these emotional states. so all of a sudden emotionally they're a lot more open and doing things and i want to be tough and all that stuff.  tim ferriss: well, it's like the training in the pool earlier, same element of transfer. brian, you looked like you had something to say. i do have another question for you also.  brian mackenzie: well, i think this all adds to - this is happiness. this is - they're having fun with their kids.   there's only really a couple other people, and other person that really comes to mind in the same way that there's a family like this, is kelly. and everything - i mean, i'm a part of that family. like i am literally - i don't live there anymore. i used to live five doors down. but i'd go up there; i'd stay at the house. i'm with the girls, i help the girls get ready. i'll take them to school. the whole process is this whole auntie-uncle, this whole thing of being happy and are we having fun. if we're not having fun, what are we doing?  gabrielle reece: but they seem even happier than we are. sometimes i feel like laird and i are like rough around the edges a little bit. like, you know, there are no secrets and it's kind of - you know, like i feel like when i see kelly, it feels like lighter and nicer. i envy that in some people.  brian mackenzie: but kelly is kelly, but you two, there has been very rare that i have seen almost a - the same type of dynamic happening where you have a husband-wife combination that is - that works in the dynamic that it does.  tim ferriss: well, here's a question for you: so the two examples that you brought up, right, kelly and juliet, the two of you, they work out together, right? and so people say sometimes, you know, those who work out together stay together. can you think of anybody offhand who does not exercise together, spouses who are very happy in the same way? can you guys? i'm just curious.  gabrielle reece: yeah.  tim ferriss: you can?  gabrielle reece: because i have friends, they function better when the two live their worlds and then they come together because in a way, even though laird and i are independent, i think we both need that touchstone with each other. and it isn't maybe even the training because the joke is the only time we train together is in the pool because it's underwater and we can't talk, because we don't train together on the land. like laird is my confidante and someone that i go to to get - bounce ideas off or a mentor in other ways, but we don't actually train together.   too many - too bossy, both. so that's the running joke. like we don't - so the pool is cool because -  laird hamilton: her class is too hard.  gabrielle reece: oh, yeah, right. like the joke is like we can train in the pool because we're under the water.  tim ferriss: because you can't smack-talk.  gabrielle reece: or just like we should do it like this; no, i should do it like that. you don't -  laird hamilton: when we used to play volleyball, i used to be the practice dummy. i would ride home in the back of the truck with the dogs.  gabrielle reece: yeah, because we'd fight.  laird hamilton: like i would be in the back with the dogs in the truck.  gabrielle reece: and i'd be driving the car; i'm like that (mumbling) underneath my breath. and laird would be sitting there and one of the dogs would be licking his face and he'd be pissed. and my team like would win on some bad call, and he'd be like, oh, you girls feel good about winning like that? and we're like, yeah, like you don't get it, like any way to win. and laird just can't understand that. so to be honest, like let's not glorify it. we do things together, but there's a lot of space because when you - days are long and when you're - and years, right? like we're going on 20 years. it's like you have to find that pace. and there are some people, if they had 9-to-5 jobs, maybe they should train together. so we have a different deal, right?  laird hamilton: but the number one thing in all successful relationships, 10,000 couples, there's only one thing that everybody had in common, no matter what the dynamic, because there's all the different dynamics. one thing only. what is it?  tim ferriss: great sex.  gabrielle reece: that's a good call. that's a good call.  laird hamilton: that was probably the second. the first thing, that the man respected the woman. the number one thing, and i guarantee you that kelly respects his wife. i guarantee you.   [overlapping comments]  brian mackenzie: so right there, those three couples, right away the man respects -  gabrielle reece: but can i say one thing? and i know all those dynamics differ, like the woman's the breadwinner, the man's the breadwinner, she's dominant, he's dominant, whatever; but ultimately more times than not is if the woman can refrain from trying to change or mother her partner, she has a greater opportunity of putting herself in a position where the guy will respect you.  brian mackenzie: it's just - it's support.  gabrielle reece: that's it.  brian mackenzie: it's support.  gabrielle reece: a man needs support. i mean, i love you guys and you're all strong, but you're very fragile, and you need to be like supported and help you fully realize your voice, whatever that is.  brian mackenzie: of course, because we're expendable and so we have to go out and die for you at some point, so we better be getting supported. you better support me because i'm going to go run in front of tyrannosaurus rex for you.  tim ferriss: so how do you best support - as a woman how do you best support your male counter -   gabrielle reece: your partner?  tim ferriss: yeah, partner, without mothering? what's the -  gabrielle reece: well, i had a great education, first and foremost. i'll be honest with you, i picked a partner who there was just no chance in hell, right? so laird said to me the first couple years we were together - and unfortunately, his mom passed away the second year we were together. i had a mom, and she died; and he made it very clear. so what it did is it let me off the hook.  tim ferriss: meaning i don't need another -  gabrielle reece: don't mother me.   and so what it did is it made me switch my brain right then where, hey, that's off the table, because women by nature, we can't help it, we're nurturers, right? so sometimes that seeps over, like, hey, honey, that joke was kind of inappropriate at the dinner table, you're talking kind of loud, all that. and then what happens is we somehow - because the man's trying to be loving and stuff. they pacify us and then they change all the ways we want them to, and then we don't want them. so it's a great thing where you just say, hey, i'm going to pick a partner that i feel like our value system is similar, we may get there very differently, but our - kind of how we wind up on some of the big items are the same. and also what you learn is, for example, laird is - when you're with laird, you feel really loved. like when he directs that at you, it's for real, right?   but it's connected to i'm restless; i need adventure, all these other things. so you sort of say - you start to understand, hey, these things over here that make this person who they are, i'm going to love all of it.  laird hamilton: ignore the fact that he talks over me and, you know -  gabrielle reece: yeah, these are small things, because you have to start looking at the big things, you know, like they're doing the best they can, they're honest. you know, it's like all these important things. and you let it ride. oh, yeah, the hair, that's another story. when i was like - i think i was 27 or -8, and laird said to me - i had said something about, you know, i took things way more personal. of course, you do. and you go, oh, yeah, that's not my thing. he said - i said something, and laird goes, yeah, but i'm here every night. and in my mind, i thought, well, duh, i'm here every night, too. but i didn't really know what that meant. for a man to say, hey, i'm going to really try to be with one woman, they're giving you all - most of what they've got. they're giving you like 80 percent. and for a woman, maybe she's giving you 35. so it's like to understand, too, like understand people's language on how they give.   let's say i was very shy and i came out and i was having a very nice, you know, sort of conversation with you. maybe i'm giving you 200 percent because of my nature. so i think it's also starting to understand like, who they are, they're giving how they can give, and receiving it that way. but don't try to change them because i always tell my friends if you want to be with a king, you have to treat them like a king. and if you're always like, no, i don't want to do that, they're a pile in the corner.  tim ferriss: exactly. brian, let me shift gears for a second here. what is the - this is going to be a jarring transition, but it's my specialty as an interviewer, awkward segues. your most gifted book, what book? and i'm going to ask you guys the same question. what book or books have you gifted the most to other people?  brian mackenzie: it's probably between two.i[indiscernible] or the - it's dan millman. way of the peaceful warrior. that's like a starter for anybody like i mentor or i work with, like who's looking -  tim ferriss: why is that a starter? what -  brian mackenzie: because it takes you from a basic like, hey, here's what's going on to like here's like potential, here's ultimate potential. like you can't fathom that. you continue to put one foot in front of the other, you can achieve these things; you can do what you set your mind out to, if you're willing to take those steps. it may not happen tomorrow, but it can happen. and i think [indiscernible] is just - once you get to a certain level, it's like, wow, like every little piece is like, whoa.  tim ferriss: layers upon layers upon layers.  brian mackenzie: that can make sense at any point of the day for me at this point, and that's i think the beauty in it.  tim ferriss: cool. thank you. gabby?  gabrielle reece: oh, my goodness. i think - you know, this sounds ridiculous, but i read atlas shrugged when i was 15, and i gave that book to a lot of people because it shifted just sort of how i looked at certain things. and obviously on the simple read, i think i've given the alchemist to quite a lot of young people because it's that reminder as you go out in the world and you're looking for all these things that sometimes it is within us or right - you know, again, we laugh like we're back on kauai. laird grew up in kauai. you know, it's like you go around the whole world.  tim ferriss: sometimes what you're looking for is right in front of you.  gabrielle reece: yeah, and i think it's more true to the idea of even something about yourself or marriage or whatever. it's like it's just right there. you just have to work at it.  tim ferriss: with atlas shrugged, it's very popular in silicon valley of course.  gabrielle reece: is it?  tim ferriss: it's very, very popular.  gabrielle reece: well, i was 15 when i read that book.tim ferriss: that's a big book.  gabrielle reece: i was a much heavier person when i was younger. i've lightened up a lot.  tim ferriss: what did - i mean, is that still a book that you would gift to people or was that just for a period of time? gabrielle reece: i think i was in my \"the world is not as it seems\" phase in my life, you know, probably until i was about 23 or -4. but i think it's just sort of a good reminder about - it's not about not taking things at face value, but it's about maybe creating your own truth because we don't - we can't really figure out any other truth.  tim ferriss: right, and objective truth that applies to everyone.  gabrielle reece: right. so i think i certainly would give it now, but maybe i would give other books now.  tim ferris: got it. laird?  laird hamilton: well, i'm going to go big here. at one point i felt there was only one book in my opinion in the world, which was the bible. and i've been through it quite a few times.  tim ferriss: and you were raised religious?  laird hamilton: no.  tim ferriss: you were not?  laird hamilton: no. but that's where i found the truth, and i found that - and i didn't gift it as much as that i gifted the teachings in it, and i think the parables are such a - i love parable teaching because it's so tangible. but when you look at just the basis of what - you know, what i find is that when you find the truth, it doesn't matter what the religion is because the truth is a golden thread that winds its way through all kinds of stuff. and so that just was the first book that i found a lot of truth in it, and then i was able to share that with people, parables. and then you run into so many situations in your life. and if you just look at basically the ten commandments and you live that way, it would increase the quality of your life. now, you know, as a young kid, books that had the most influence on me, you know, i mean, the lord of the rings was like a huge thing. when i was young, my mom read those books to me before i could even read, and so i went through the trilogy of those as a young man and, you know, jonathan liebesman, [indiscernible] and the doom and all these other fantasy books.   but the bible really - i mean, that thing just had - you know, then now if you ask me today like what book am i gifting everybody today, i'm gifting natural born heroes. you know, like that's my book of the -  gabrielle reece: yeah, they have a man book club.  laird hamilton: in the gym. we train together and we have a book of the week or the book of the month. and whoever gets one, we go and - you know, of course rick's always a big contributor to -   [overlapping comments]  laird hamilton: everybody's contributing, you know. deep survival is another great -  tim ferriss: deep survival?  laird hamilton: yeah, laurence gonzales. that's an incredible book in speaking about just fear and dealing with fear. but this natural born heroes is my - that's my latest kind of craze, just because of - you know, again, but all of these, all - you know, no fiction stuff. nonfiction truth.   the way my mind works, i don't want - i don't want - i mean, it's almost like i had the fiction when i was young to create imagination and fantasy, but really what i hunger is truth, like what is the truth, what are facts, give me information that i can apply. i want to be able to apply this stuff to life.  tim ferriss: so here's a question about some truth and testing truth that i'm really curious to ask you, and that is -  gabrielle reece: you're into testing stuff?  tim ferriss: you know, every once in a while. every once in a while when i'm walking around with a drip bag attached to me, occasionally. you're known as an innovator in the sort of water sports world, whether it's tow-in surfing, foil board, or any number of other things.   [overlapping comments]tim ferriss: but he's evolved, he's grown legs. moved on to land. what has enabled you to contribute in that way? because people have been playing in the water for a very long time. what is the - what are the characteristics or the moments that led to you being able to have these breakthroughs or contribute to these innovations?  laird hamilton: i think a combination of a couple of things. i think there's a little bit of a formula that i've been fortunate enough to be subjected to, to how i was raised and then, you know, like again being exposed to the lord of the rings and doom and some of these really incredible imagination - sort of development of imagination. you know, thomas edison is quoted as saying, you know, all you need to be an inventor is an imagination and a pile of junk. and so, you know, i lived at the end of a road where you didn't call people to fix stuff; you fixed it and, you know, you didn't have anything that was - you couldn't go buy stuff.   you had to make stuff. and so, you know, and then i grew up in a way where i was - you know, there was a racial thing because i was not liked for how i was born. so then i would be like, well, why would i be worried about what people think when i do something that makes them upset. they're already upset. they're upset for how i was born. so some of those things, you know, where you have an imagination and you're willing to subject yourself to failure, that's a big part of it, of any innovation. you've got to be willing to crash and burn and at the cost of looking like a fool, people laughing at you and not letting that dictate what you do. i think peer pressure - you know, if it was up to other people they wouldn't let you do anything. no one would create anything because that's just stupid, whether it's your dad or, you know, i mean, i used to have - you know, i had a teacher tell me once in school you can't eat your surfboard.  tim ferriss: oh, meaning like that's not going to pay the bills.  laird hamilton: no. you're never going to make a life out of using that or - i'm just saying those are all the, you know -  tim ferriss: worst advice ever.  laird hamilton: so i think those are a lot of the factors, right? those are the key elements. i think if you look at anybody who's willing to subject themselves to failure and -gabrielle reece: and relentless pursuit. understand once they're in the wheelhouse, it is like not going away. you can talk about it and write it down and do it again.   [overlapping comments]  gabrielle reece: well, it's weird because it isn't - it's weird. it's not so destructively obsessive, but it's just this tone that you kind of notice you've got; it's still there, huh? is stand-up paddling. so 1998 or -7 or so, laird decided, oh, i'm going to, you know, try the - it's another way to train. he was on a long board using kayak paddles and then taping handles. and then before you know it, we're driving to some guy's house that he's asked to - milama, is that who it was? on maui.   like extended wooden paddle, so he did for the canoe paddlers in hawaii. so laird went to him and said, oh, can you make it longer? and then breaking that one and breaking another one and then, you know, just trying new boards and, oh, that guy doesn't have boards, blanks big enough for a stand-up paddle board, so i've got to find a guy. oh, there's a guy in san diego. just like going nonstop, nonstop, break things, go out, and just - and then on top of it, do it every day, like down-winder, you know, another down-winder.  tim ferriss: what's a down-winder?  gabrielle reece: so in maui when it's too windy, you know, to surf maybe, that means the wind is probably up. and in maui, it's very windy. so he gets dropped off at one point and then goes with the wind down. with stand-up paddling, that was really one of the best first things that he used it for. and then, you know, he incorporated surfing later. but, i mean, just persistent and constant, every day.   even foiling. i really - if i look at foiling, it's like laird ultimately has been practicing rigorously for the last seven years, quietly, patiently, to get a ride and maybe another ride coming but a ride that he had this winter on a wave that he's been secretly thinking about probably for 40 years of his life. so there's a patience but a relentlessness that i'm like, wow, that is - kudos to you that you hang in there.  tim ferriss: yeah.  gabrielle reece: it's a lot.  [overlapping comments]! gabrielle reece: well, it's pretty impressive though.  tim ferriss: you of course have exhibited -  gabrielle reece: no, no, it's very different. i would never -  tim ferriss: because you've achieved a lot in many different areas. so how is it different?  gabrielle reece: well, laird says like i'm, you know, stern - i'm a low, steady flame. laird goes at it at a different degree. he gets there much quicker.  tim ferriss: burns hot for a very long period of time.  gabrielle reece: yeah. and also just physically that he can express himself with that kind of endurance is different. a lot of mine is mental. it's a different - it's just different.   but i really respect that in laird because also he does it when no one is watching, he doesn't tell any - he's not talking about it unless it's to have a conversation about how to approach it, attack it, improve it. and so it is a very personal quest that he's on for reasons of his own. like one day we were driving up pch, and there was like literally all these stand-up paddlers out there. and i can remember clearly when it was laird dragging his one friend out there for seven or eight years before anyone was stand-up paddling. and i said how does that make you feel? and he goes, i knew i was having so much fun. so it was never the idea of like, oh, i'm going to somehow bring this into modern day; it was i'm doing this for myself because i have an idea that i want to express. and so it's one of the things i appreciate. or will it bring me fun and enjoyment? straight up, you know.  tim ferriss: well, maybe that's part of the reason you guys are happy, because that's set in high on the list.   you're laughing, laird, but - could you explain to people also because - the foil boarding. now, this takes my like fear factor to a whole new level because you're basically - well, why don't you explain it for folks? but it's not like you just jump off the board if things are going sideways, right? i mean, so what is a foil board?laird hamilton: well, it's a surfboard or just a board like a wakeboard with a big strut, like a foil, which is - you know, you see the america's cup guys are using them, and it's a big shaft.  gabrielle reece: it's three feet. it's over three feet long.  laird hamilton: yeah, 48 inches tall.  tim ferriss: beneath the board?  laird hamilton: beneath the board. it's like a big fin. it makes the board fly off the water, but you're attached to it with snowboard boots and bindings, which, you know, you don't swim well with boots. but it's something that we've kind of came upon as - you know, all of it's about evolution. you try to ride the biggest surf in the world, and so first we started, you know, with prone guns conventionally and then -  tim ferriss: what are prone guns?  laird hamilton: like when you lay down on these big guns, and then we knew -  tim ferriss: guns is the board?  laird hamilton: yeah. when we say gun, it's designed for giant waves. it's what all the - you know, the modern, manual way to catch waves.  tim ferriss: got it.  laird hamilton: and it's an ancient way of doing it. but you know, we found a cap and we realized there was a ceiling. and then the -  tim ferriss: that's because the bigger waves move faster or -  laird hamilton: bigger waves move faster; we're not able to physically keep up. and that's where the concept of towing came from, the idea of being towed onto one and using the power to match the speed of the wave in order to ride bigger surf. and when we did that, it made us - allowed us to ride smaller equipment that was actually faster.  tim ferriss: right.  laird hamilton: and then we could perform on these giant waves.tim ferriss: and when you say giant, just for people who may not be familiar with big-wave surfing, what are we talking?  laird hamilton: well, i mean, you know, you start - a giant starts at, you know, 50-foot faces, and then it goes above.   so 60, 70, 80-foot faces. i mean, that's giant. big surf is - you know, when we say it's big, it's 50 and below. and then when it goes to giant, and then it goes to like ridiculous or enormous, you know, whatever. there's big, there's giant, there's enormous. you know, and then everybody can get into 82.5 feet and all that stuff, but we found a cap, you know, at manual. we found a cap. ultimately we found a cap with tow-in.  tim ferriss: for tow-in. and what is the cap?  laird hamilton: probably in the range of a hundred feet. so that's - and we know there's a cap there. we know that there's an ability -  brian mackenzie: he knows because he's been there.  laird hamilton: so we know there's a cap. and so at that point, and the continual pursuit was how do we get - what are we going to need to do? and we know that the only way we can do that is to not be on the surface because surface tension is the thing that creates the most drag, which is what is stopping us once the waves are moving at a certain speed.  tim ferriss: now, what was the moment or the conversation or the event where it was like, holy shit, like we could do this? like because the idea of putting the strut, having that foil-like effect on a board, it hadn't occurred previously.  laird hamilton: well, no, it actually - you know, i always say every day there's no new idea, just a new application of an old idea. so this - there's a seated foil called an air chair. it sat in a garage on maui. and one summer we were playing around, and my friend goes, oh, this guy's got this weird contraption. so we went over to the house. it was in the corner. it had dust on it, cobwebs. we were like what's that? oh, it's some stupid thing called an air chair. i mean, it wasn't bad enough that he wouldn't let us keep it; but we got it and we rode it and we were in -  tim ferriss: now, were you being towed behind something or -  laird hamilton: and you're strapped to it.  gabrielle reece: i think murphy created it.  laird hamilton: yeah, yeah, and you're strapped to it with a seat, like - and i thought it was for handicapped initially because the position was very - you're strapped with a belt.  tim ferriss: wheelchair-like.  laird hamilton: yeah.  brian mackenzie: they used to tow people behind boats with them.  laird hamilton: yeah. and now they have a new one - yeah, so now they have the sky ski, where they do flips and people ride these things and do amazing things on them, and you're towed behind a boat, like a water ski boat. and so we got one, and the first thing we wanted to do was stand on it because we go, listen, again, part of our model is stand up, stand up on the golf port, stand up on stand-up feeling, stand up, like standing up, a better position to be in. we're humans. you know, seated is not great, crawling is not wonderful, laying down is even worse. so we - you know, so we started to stand on. and as soon as we stood on it, we go, oh, we can stand. i mean, it was hard because we were using the seat and kind of - and we didn't have bindings. and so -  tim ferriss: that sounds extraordinarily precarious.  laird hamilton: very bad. and it has a big, sharp blade on the bottom of it, so it's not something you don't want to be attached to because if the thing comes around, it's - you know; it could be a bad problem. so then we just took that, and we asked the guy if it was okay if we - if we played with it, as long as we didn't damage any of it. he said sure. so i took the foil out of the board, and i took a wakeboard and we made kind of a makeshift housing so that the foil could fit on there. and i put snowboard boots on it because we had been doing a lot of snowboarding. and within, you know, the first day or two, all of a sudden we're standing on this thing and flying. and as soon as we stood and flew and we knew we could control it, we were like, oh, now we have to go on the waves. we were like this is going to be for wave riding.  gabrielle reece: you towed behind a ski boat for like almost three years, maybe more.  laird hamilton: yeah. and flat water.  gabrielle reece: like there's practice, lots of practice.   not to mention, weren't you messing around with the hippity hop? wasn't that the hippity hop, or was that for tow surfing?  laird hamilton: no, the hippity hop was for - that was for -  tim ferriss: so what is the hippity hop?  gabrielle reece: laird used to go out in front of our house in maui. it was the hippity hop, and he would try to do spare air.  tim ferriss: i am so lost. what is a hippity hop?  gabrielle reece: what? when you were a kid?  tim ferriss: i have no idea what that is.   [overlapping comments]  gabrielle reece: and like the face of a horse on it or something. laird used to take those, fold them up really small, and attach it to spare air, which is like basically one shot of air if you're a diver or somebody under. and in case - he was trying to figure out ways to have water -  laird hamilton: what we were looking to do - it was pre-floatation, and we were in giant surf. we were still kind of searching for floatation because we were worried about -  tim ferriss: pre-floatation, you mean like the vests?  gabrielle reece: yeah.  tim ferriss: okay, pre-life vest i guess.  laird hamilton: yeah, but this is pre us using life vests in giant surf. now it's everybody uses floatation devices in the giant surf.  gabrielle reece: so let's just say there are a lot of stages between that. now laird is riding with terry and they're doing in kauai three or four years behind boats and skis. one broken foot.  laird hamilton: because we were in the beginning of the conception of kiting as well, so we -tim ferriss: kite boarding?  laird hamilton: yeah. i mean, more or less the modern tow board is what made kite-boarding possible initially, and then the wakeboards came in after. but we were the first ones to get the french -  gabrielle reece: the non-restartable kites.  laird hamilton: the non-restartable, right, right, where you just release the guy and he just flies until he craps and then it was over. and sometimes you'd be like two miles out to sea with a giant quilt. have you ever tried to swim with a quilt? it's very hard. like a giant quilt, with a quilt and a lunch tray. literally the board looks like a lunch tray and a quilt, and it's like you're two miles out and you're looking at the shore and you're like this is not a good day for me.  tim ferriss: so how does the hippity-hop fit into all this?  gabrielle reece: well, because it's all - i'm just saying it was all part of like simultaneously trying to figure out the equipment and how to ride it and use it, how to be safer and make it possible.  tim ferriss: so would he be like on the foil board with the hippity-hop between his legs or -  gabrielle reece: no, at first - no, he's too smart for that. he'd be with it folded up, and then he'd go out where there's some, you know, white water messing around, and then he'd implode or -  laird hamilton: get dropped off and then pull it, and then we started just seeing if it was okay. so we'd have a pre-inflated -   [overlapping comments] laird hamilton: dropped off in front of the giant wave, and then - but we realized that the hippity-hop just hit you in the head, and you'd come up and you'd be face-down and the hippity-hop would be out of the water but you would still be under. so we - i hopped off the hippity-hop.  brian mackenzie: this goes back to like what she was talking about with the whole incessant like i'm just going to do this, but here's the thing: is i actually know guys who have taken - who have attempted to do the foil boarding, and they just gave up because they're like it's too hard, it's too difficult. they did not have the patience or the time to want to invest themselves into something, which is like - which is also why a lot of this stuff just works, like with the relationships that they have and even the relationship i have with them, is it is a commitment.   it's a full commitment.  tim ferriss: now, why do you think laird sticks to it when these other people don't? do you think it's - and i won't make it a totally multiple-choice question; these are the options kind of running through my head, right, just having observed how you guys live. like is it something innate; possible, right? is it influences that he's had? is it the peer group that he surrounds himself with or some other factor? or all?  brian mackenzie: all of the above. because like i grew up in a very similar fashion where i was very rebellious, where i was told i wasn't going to be able to do things. i didn't. i screwed around. and now it's like you come around full circle to that to where you learn how to get good at something you were good at.   and where he learned early on is what it seems is that, wow, this worked, this happened, i'm making a living off of surfing or whatever that was that - and he's not doing it in a contest. he's doing it on his own. like she's grown up in an environment where it wasn't the greatest family environment to where she's thriving and they've created this whole thing where, you know, i was able to do things that i shouldn't - like i was told i wasn't going to do, and i did. and it was because of the - i was so passionate about what i was doing and i was willing to commit to that and continue to see the results of what that brought, but that became, oh, this is what makes sense, you know, and, i mean, i just wrote something on an instagram post yesterday kind of about this where it's like if you don't have the ability to pay attention enough to your training to understand what rest is, you're now in an ocd-like behavior to where it's like you don't even understand how you're going to get better at something, where it's just paying attention.   and it's like, hey, if i'm paying attention -   [overlapping comments]  laird hamilton: but also part of paying attention is being aware of what's happening and seeing it before it's done. i mean, at the end it's about envisioning it, too, right? you can see what - you have to be able to see it to continue to pursue it.tim ferriss: okay, this is a super important point. so for yourself, what would be an example of that?  laird hamilton: of seeing it and being able to - well, just any one of the things i've been involved with, knowing, like for example, we were able to foil some giant surfs this season. now, up until then we haven't really ever been - i was in doubt of being able to - even instinctively i knew that this definitely the way to do this, but i didn't - i haven't seen it.   you know, and again, it's that ability to see it before -  tim ferriss: envision it, the possibility.  laird hamilton: yes, envision it to know it, and then you have all those other things that you need to pursue, but you have to actually be able to see to keep you -  tim ferriss: motivated. brian, i have a question for you because you've worked with so many athletes, and i might want to ask you guys the same question, and that is - and kelly is an expert at this as well. but what would your advice to be a, say - it doesn't really matter the age, 30, 35, 40, doesn't matter, but a former athlete who's beaten themselves up - may or may not be me - no, it's not me. but somebody who's really just beating the shit out of themselves who wants to either continue training or get back to the point where they're competing in god knows what, right? you've observed so many athletes.   what should they do more of? what should they do less of?  brian mackenzie: more humility.  tim ferriss: more humility.  brian mackenzie: that's why i thought it was so important that you come up here. it wasn't, oh, i need to dose tim with humility; no, it's like, hey, come see what it's like to apply something that you can do for the rest of your life.  tim ferriss: yep, yep.  brian mackenzie: if you can't see what you are doing, if you think at 20 that i can just bang away and go as heavy as i want, as hard as i want, as long as i want, and it's not going to have repercussions, you're not looking at it correctly. and i've been there, i've done it. and i think this goes to - like this also comes around to i've learned a lot in the fact that i know - like for one, i don't have the only program. what i'm putting out isn't the only way.   there are a thousand ways. it's no longer about me being right, and that's a lot with what they're doing. it's not about being right. i see the potential of this and yeah, the world now knows standup paddle. like they now know it, and it's not about i'm right, this was me. like it's not that. i think it's where, as an athlete, if you've beaten yourself up to the point to where it's like i've got to deal with this injury or i've got to deal with this stuff, i'm not what i used to be, it's, well, you have a lifetime right now. what do you want to do? is it about winning? is it about being the best at something or is it about how much better can i be tomorrow at what i'm doing today and can i just chip away at a little of that? and that is what not only i have learned to surround myself with, is people who are doing that, but that's what's these two are doing, that's what kelly's doing, that's what you've done with your career, is you've literally immersed yourself into an environment where you have bred i'm going to meet people who want to be in the long game.   and that's what it's about. and it really ultimately comes down -  tim ferriss: training for life.  brian mackenzie: that's what the truth is. there's nothing further from that, is this is what the truth is.  laird hamilton: i have a bunch of friends that are professional athletes, but one particular one, and we were talking about his training and everything, and i said - i go let me just say what my perspective is when you ask me about training. train in a way so that when you're done playing, you can go do all the things you want to do. and i don't mean sit around and drink whiskey and smoke cigars; i mean the things you want to do physically, like all of the things you want to do. so have a training routine and go about your playing so that when you're done doing that, you can walk maybe. that would be great. how about you can run? how about you can swim? how about you can bike? how about you can go water ski, snow ski, or whatever things you want to do because there's obviously some things you're still going to want to do, right? and so i think that's the focus is like training for life, like training in a way that's sustainable that you can handle.ilike you said, you can't just take the hammering for the next 60 years and then wonder, well, man, i can't even walk. and even when you do it that way, it's still you have to do all the pieces, too. you've got to remember that, you know, as an athlete you've got to have - it's the whole picture, it's not just the physical. it's the eating, it's the sleeping, it's the relationships. it's all of those things, what you're putting in your brain, what you're putting in your mouth. i mean, these are all - who you're hanging out with. all of that stuff is going to feed into the performance.  tim ferriss: for instance, one thing i'd never seen before, i've seen people roll out on foam rollers, i've seen people roll out on weird-looking devices that, you know, kelly makes that look like sexual toys.   i've never seen someone roll out on a weight plate before.  laird hamilton: well, actually brought that and had the 45 pounds. and i was like that's funny because i was just - somebody else had just given me the kettle bell. so the kettle bell was a wicked one until i got the -  tim ferriss: so using the handle of the kettle bell on your -  laird hamilton: in the gut. and then kelly one-upped me with a 45-pound platter. but i didn't have that one by the pool, so we used a ten-pound platter.  tim ferriss: just the plate?  laird hamilton: yeah.  gabrielle reece: i think another important thing and that brian was saying is that hopefully you hope all of us - and you do this all the time - you're the ultimate student because you always have to adjust and be open. like this is working but maybe i should change it because it's a moving target, and be open to other people's information and not be threatened by it and give it a try if you're not good at it or whatever. i think that that's a really important thing because then you can keep growing and evolving.   so for those athletes, i think it's just be open and be a student, but then you have to be disciplined.  laird hamilton: you also have to be willing to accept your weaknesses and cultivate those. it's like it's funny because everybody - the strong people all go lift weights.tim ferriss: the flexible people all go do yoga.  laird hamilton: and you're like, wait, all you flexible people should go bang some iron and all you big weight-lifters should go do some yoga. it's like but we always gravitate towards our strengths because we want to be in our glory.  gabrielle reece: i'm not just sore enough and hurt enough that i'm like, okay, i give.  laird hamilton: being the student, being the teacher, all that, and also the - and again, the willingness to fail being one of the key elements to all those things is ever present because that means you're willing to subject yourself to, okay, if somebody knows something i don't know, that's failure.   some new thing you haven't done before that you're not going to be good at, like people want to come in and be good at stuff. that's why the foil board drives half the guys away, because they can't just get on it and rip it the first time.  tim ferriss: well, that's just the foil board. but brian, you were saying that, i mean, obviously a lot of very good athletes come and do the pool workout, and it's like that's a big humility sandwich right there.  brian mackenzie: we brought a rower up here.  tim ferriss: rower, like crew rower?  brian mackenzie: yeah. she rowed my wife in 2005.  gabrielle reece: like the guys gave her it all.  brian mackenzie: yeah. and we brought her up here and we put her in the pool, and everybody was just like -  gabrielle reece: it was astounding.  brian mackenzie: she had the elements though because she was already a phenomenal swimmer. super strong. you know, again, having those key -  gabrielle reece: but it was odd because she has all the physical attributes, but she was very humble.  laird hamilton: she wanted to learn.  brian mackenzie: the disposition, because you put might and aggression over there, the water goes, oh, mighty, aggressive, perfect, i'll just drown you. and normally as males we just implement aggression and power.   tim ferriss: so you mentioned weaknesses and strengths, and i wanted to touch on something that you mentioned to me earlier today, which i found very interesting. when we're doing the ammo box exercise and you talked about isolating limbs and isolating weaknesses, could you elaborate on that a little bit?  laird hamilton: and listen, we know that if you work on being more ambidextrous that you get better. it's like, you know, you throw knives with your right hand and you're really good at it; well, start throwing them with your left hand and it actually makes you better with your right. but again, about isolation of the weaknesses, is about being realistic about what your flaws are and working on those. and that's why anything to do with instability, when you talk about balance or in the pool, it really is going to exaggerate those places that normally you can compensate.   because it's hard to compensate in the pool when you have to swim with your left hand if you have a big dumbbell in your right hand because there's no other left hand; there's only the one you have. and if it doesn't work, you've got to figure out how to make it work, right? and you can really - and it really shows you, you can really see. you know, you throw a ball with your left hand if you're right-handed and you feel like, oh, my gosh, whose arm is this, i can't even use this arm, or kick with your left leg or even when you go into stretching and you look at stretching, why is my right hamstring so much looser than my left hamstring, why is my left quad so much tighter than my right quad. all those things, those are all weaknesses at the end.  tim ferriss: and what do you feel like your current weaknesses are that you're working on?  laird hamilton: it's ongoing. i've got a lot of destruction, you know. i've been beating myself up for a long time, so my weaknesses have more to do with damage. but like i got some hip flexor, some things going on with my right leg because of the load that i put on it.  tim ferriss: why your right leg?  laird hamilton: well, it's my back leg in surfing, but it's also because my left leg has been broken seven times. so that's -! tim ferriss: from surfing or other things?  laird hamilton: surfing and other things, but i broke my ankle a bunch of times and arch and a bunch of - all the metatarsals and stuff on the left. the left ankle and the left foot has taken a lot of the impact. and so my right has been carrying it, you know, for all these extra years. so it's got - you know, my right leg has a couple, maybe five or ten more years of use than my left leg. so i'm dealing with that, and the fact is that we're all asymmetrical. i mean, even - i told the girls the other day, i go look at the tennis players, i go look at their throwing hand, and they're like, oh, my goodness, the guy's one arm is so much bigger than the other one. but you don't even see it unless you look for it.  tim ferriss: focus on it, yeah.  laird hamilton: but, you know, i think that that's a - again, those are the - you know, right now, like i say, it's a hip thing.   you know, it's - i mean, there's always - and it's moving and -  gabrielle reece: but even with that, you're very disciplined. i've got to say laird is a good patient. like if he has homework, he does his homework. if he's told to do stretches, he does his stretches. so you're always - laird hamilton: that's come out of necessity. that's because i've been hurt so many times. i mean, you really don't learn anything about yourself ultimately until you've been injured. back to failure. whether something failed or you did something that made you crash and get hurt, but at the end -  gabrielle reece: but you also - the thing is, like even brian mentioned earlier, the something that you have that you've discovered is he has the faith that if i do this, then i'll probably be a little better tomorrow. so they have that faith. and that, too, laird knows, okay, if i'm not feeling well, if i keep trying different things and i stay open and i do my homework, i can probably be proactive in heling myself get better.   and i think those elements are important because sometimes what happens is sometimes if people aren't feeling well, they're this aged athlete or whatever, they're so far under it, they don't have that faith anymore or they don't understand how to unravel that knot. and so i think, you know, it's like priming the pump. sometimes the water doesn't come out right away, but then if you just keep going, it will start to flow. and i think, you know, certainly in this situation these guys have seen it enough times, and i think that's a really important thing for people to figure out.  laird hamilton: well, if you have had the fortune to actually have been through and had success, then it gives you hope. you know, when this is your one time and you've been perfectly iron man forever and all of a sudden something happens, you're like the whole house breaks and you're in shock and you can't - where if you've been through it and you've recovered once and then you get in and had another thing and you've had enough stuff but you made it back through, you know, it builds the belief that you can do it.  tim ferriss: i think another piece of this, and i'd love to ask you about this, brian, is that a lot of athletes surround themselves with people who love to commiserate. so an athlete will be like, oh, well, you know, i just turned 30; and once you turn 30, like, oh, my god, my aching joints. i know you guys are both covering your faces, and the reason is, you know, i've - but this is so common and that everyone sits around and bitches and moans, and they use that as an excuse.  gabrielle reece: but it's media and society, too.  tim ferriss: but what i love about, you know, hanging out with you guys or like titus, right, there's a photograph. so titus was in the surfing episode of the tim ferriss experiment, the tv show, and walked into his garage and there's this photo of him surfing a 50-plus-foot wave, and i'm like what is that? he goes, oh, yeah, it was my 50th birthday. and i was just like i have no excuses, like shame on me for ever even thinking i have an excuse. and hanging out with rick, for instance, and then i guess the name - is it don wildman? was that - could you explain to people - and then, brian, i'd love to ask you, outside of the examples i just gave, sort of who inspires you in that same way? like one my - my only coach really i'm working with right now is 62, a former four-time world record holder in olympic weight-lifting. and he can still do what he used to do.   i mean, not necessarily in the same weights, but cold, he can just go out and jump into like [indiscernible] and tennis shoes. and it's so inspiring to me because whenever i'm like, oh, woe is me, my poor left ankle, i'm like suck it up, ferriss, like give me a break. so wildman, can you explain -  brian mackenzie: well, don wildman, 82, 80 days of snowboarding last year. i just went heli snowboarding with him like a month ago or two months ago in alaska. just, you know, i mean, heli boarding is a rigorous activity, a week straight, you know, 15, 16 runs a day; you know, the third, fourth day, you're wobbling, not a word out of the gunslinger. but when you meet him, you know, his hunger for information, his youthful enthusiasm, you know, it's like i think that is such a key element when you look at any of these guys. you see an enthusiasm in them, and i think that's what happens to a lot of athletes. i think they just lose their enthusiasm. they're burnt out. they've been doing their sport since they were 5 or 10 and the pressure around it.   and so i believe ultimately that it's a conscious decision with a physical manifestation. and so don was never accepting it as being, you know, the guy that hold - he always gives you stuff like the guy that held the olympic record for lifting was 52 or 54 before steroids and blah, blah, blah, and all this stuff, you know, and you see that. but what's great about somebody like don, who's my guy that i look to, is that just - there it is. you don't have to imagine what it looks like. there is it, it's alive, it's well. i mean, i put don on a bicycle and i can take pretty much almost anybody on a bicycle unless you're like a professional bicyclist, and he will hammer you.  you will be hammered, and you will be asking me how old is the guy up in the front with the gray hair?  tim ferriss: 82. and he can still do, what, like 15, 17 pull-ups and then - he's a pull-up machine.  brian mackenzie: amongst other things. that's a small -  tim ferriss: what would you attribute that to? like why has he not lost his enthusiasm? and maybe a different way of putting it is for people who are like, god, i would love to have that enthusiasm, but i just don't, like how do i develop that? what do i do? like i'm willing to work, like what do i do to have that youthful -  brian mackenzie: well, i mean, i think in his case, he's got a couple driving forces. he has guilt, and he loves to eat.   so that's one. like don has a unique thing about that that he can implement, like he wants to eat whatever he wants. and he loves to eat like cakes and pies and ice cream, and like he'll just devour that stuff. but at the same time, he wants to be - he's not going to be - he doesn't want any fat on his body. so for him, he's earning it. like in his particular case, he's earning it, right? and also, too, you know, he always says it takes the piss and vinegar out of you. you know what i mean? like he knows how it affects his mood and how it makes him feel. and so once you subject yourself to it for long enough and you're consistent enough, you know, you start to get addicted to that. you're like food tastes great, my sleeping is great, and my sex is unbelievable. you know, it's like all this stuff where he just - and then you don't want to lose that. that's the norm, and then that becomes the driving force. and then it's easier.   and it's never an option. you never make it - it's like gabby says, you know, it's not like you don't choose whether you want to brush your teeth or not. you don't go, oh, i'm not going to brush my teeth this week, you know, i don't need to do that. it's just something -   gabrielle reece: well, the other thing don does that's very genius, it goes back to what brian said, which is he solicits people to be in his group because no man can really do it alone. so he always has these guys around him, most of them quite a bit younger. so the energy goes into the pot, and everybody rolls.  brian mackenzie: or girls, yeah.  gabrielle reece: well, yeah, one girl.  brian mackenzie: but he loves to be a host and bring people with him and do things.  gabrielle reece: he'll give you the bike; he'll get your music set up for you. he'll do everything for you.  brian mackenzie: erin and i do that. it's like we invite - i'm picking up a girl this afternoon at lax who's going to be staying with us for a week to train, participate, and it's like -  tim ferriss: thank you for your 80 units of energy contribution to the pot.  brian mackenzie: now we're going to absorb that.   it also confirms that you're - it's like a reminder, you know, because, again, it's like gabby would say with the stand-up paddlers. at the end when you go through what you went through today and i see your face and i know what it did to you and i know later you'll be like sitting somewhere and you'll want to go to sleep, i'll be like, hey, just give me the call. call me because it's confirmation that you're - when you're alone in something, a lonely place is an unmotivated place.tim ferriss: that's a great way to put it.  brian mackenzie: it's very unique to find a complete loner that has full maximum motivation, really motivated. we are communal. we are communal, but that's why we're subjected to all of this peer pressure, too. we're subjected to social pressure of, hey, now you're 30, you're over the hill, what are you going to do now? you know what i mean? but that's social stuff that we implement.   but the reverse of that is, hey, we're all together and you're 60, you're 70, i'm 50, he's 30, we're all going, let's go.  tim ferriss: i was talking to my trainer's wife, who's awesome, and she also has a couple of world records. and super sweetheart. and she's i guess 55, around there, and she was - she said to me, she's like you know when people start to get old, and she said it's when they stop jumping, when they stop jumping. we can talk about whether that's right or wrong, but the follow-up was even more interesting to me because she has a daughter, a young daughter, and there was something stuck up in a tree. and she got up into the tree, and her daughter was like, mom, be careful, it's really high. and she climbed up 20, 25 feet, got the thing out, and climbed back down. she was like do you know what it says to a daughter to see her mom who's 55 effortlessly like go up into a tree, get it, and come down? like it just shows her possibilities that -  brian mackenzie: sometimes like your kids see you train like we train. they may be like, well, maybe i don't want to train. maybe i don't want to climb trees, mom's crazy.  tim ferriss: brian, who else sort of inspires you, people you look up to as, say, a don wildman type? it doesn't have to be someone older than you, but like who are the people you look to as inspiration when maybe you're feeling overwhelmed or burned out or we'll fill in the blank?  brian mackenzie: i do a decent amount of reading and a decent amount of watching of documentaries and a decent amount of being voyeuristic with people who are creative, regardless of that creativity. a lot of it has to do with food sometimes. you look at what they're doing. like 20 years ago, maybe a little longer, chefs were not looked at as anything; they were just in the back cooking. now if you pay enough attention, they are these masterful creators of things. you know, one of the best documentaries i've ever seen is a movie called spinning plates. it's a must-see if you're really looking to progress yourself because there's a guy by the name of - his name is grant and he runs one of the top seven restaurants in the world, and he has this way of dealing with food, much like you see a lot of great chefs at this point.  tim ferriss: what country is he in?  brian mackenzie: he's in the united states.  tim ferriss: is his name grant atkins?  brian mackenzie: yes, yes, grant atkins. so he's got alinea, so they're following alinea; but they're also following a homestead in like iowa that's just this family-run place that the entire community goes to, and then they're following this mexican place in tucson, which is barely making it. and they play the entire show, and you're watching this movie or this documentary on all of these places and as they're progressing in their trials, their tribulations, and all this stuff.   and at the end, grant has seen the entire thing, and you think he's this like demigod of food, and he explains what he does. and he goes, you know, what i'm doing is if somebody can come to my restaurant and they feel that they taste the food and they feel it and they come to ask in the back, because they can talk to the chef, and they say, hey, i feel like i know you. and he goes that's exactly what i want to do. in essence, that's what i do, is it's like i want people to see how i see the world. don't take everything i do, but let it inspire you to some degree. but he literally goes at the end of this thing, the mexican restaurant is doing the exact same thing, and it failed at that point in the movie. literally they went bankrupt and they didn't make it and, you know, it didn't last. and he's like but nobody understood that because they think because it's not flashy and it's this thing that they're not getting that experience, yet it was that experience. and that homestead, that's the exact same thing i'm doing.   they're just expressing themselves in another way through this, and we're not taking the time to understand that. and i think that's where one of the missing links is with a lot of people, is we want this great, huge, massive inspiration, but the fact is every bit of inspiration you need or want is in front of you and anything you want if you're willing to go the length to be obsessive enough about it. and i think that it's not just food with me. it's like i just watched some coach do something the other day who i remember this kid like seven years ago at my buddy's gym, and he was just this little kid who was just learning and wanting to understand. he's doing things right now from a gymnastics perspective that he's showing people through social media of him doing things and how he sees the world that is just amazing, and i'm like i get so much out of that.   and i'm like i'm going to go and do some stuff that's like inspiring me to do that. and it's what you choose to get out of it i think.  tim ferriss: what's his name?  brian mackenzie: his name is colin paraday.  tim ferriss: cool, i'll check it out. i think it's so true. i mean, like you were saying, laird, no new ideas, just sort of old concepts and ideas apply to new areas, it's like you don't have to look in fitness to find inspiration to be better in fitness; you can look at someone like grant. laird hamilton: grant's amazing.  tim ferriss: yeah, i mean, he cooked for i think it was a period of one or two years with no taste because he had tongue cancer. who was it? beethoven i think who composed without being able to hear. just insane. so i want to be really - this is so much fun, but i want to be respectful of your time. so i'll just ask one or two more questions. so why don't we start with - and i'll ask the same question of all three of you. but gabby, what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self?  gabrielle reece: well, i always say i would have - and i mentioned this earlier, but certainly not to take anything personal but also maybe don't hold yourself back. i think sometimes - and i think this is a trait of a female more than of a male. we have a tendency sometimes to sit on our talents and potentials because we don't want to offend anyone or we don't want to be singled out, you know. i heard a great story, i had a coach once that said - he was an assistant coach to the men's usa volleyball team. and this game, it was one point, and the coach looked straight at [indiscernible] and said i need you to put this ball away and you to win this game, and it was like, boom, okay. and he said it was amazing, and then he did it.   and then he had his opportunity; he was coaching a bunch of women at a very high level. and he did the same thing to the athlete that was the one. and everyone, it didn't work because all the other - it was a singling out that women - we have a hard time with, instead of understanding that you can be singled out but still for the greater good. so i think i would have maybe not tried to - i think i sat on some of my talents a little bit and also i think i certainly, like i said, i took things personally. so i would tell that person like don't take it personally. i tell my kids learn how to say, i'm sorry, that doesn't work for me. again, i've learned a lot from being around men. i respect a lot of traits. you can deliver a message without emotion. usually women, in order to finally stand up for themselves, they have to be kind of ramped up, and then it just comes out ballistic, instead of, no, that doesn't work for me. and then we don't - and also not to then second guess that after you've laid that line down. i think that that's really important. and i think, you know, it's important to, if you have gifts and talents, whatever they are, don't feel guilty and bad or weird about it.   you know, you don't have to be a schmuck. i mean, you don't have to - i always tell kids if you're on the team, you're lucky; and if you're the best one, you're the luckiest. so it's calibrating all of that. i think i would have done that. you know, we always say we're grateful for it because it gets you where you are.  tim ferriss: grateful for?  gabrielle reece: for whatever things you had to go through that you did or didn't do. the notion of regret is - it's not that it's pointless, but, you know, it's sort of like that gets you to where you are.  tim ferriss: yeah. good advice. good advice for anybody. laird, what advice would you give your 30-year-old self?  laird hamilton: stop drinking now. stop drinking right now and patent all your ideas.  tim ferriss: good advice. they go together well, too. that was good advice. brian, what about you?  brian mackenzie: i think be patient, be more patient.  tim ferriss: and what if your 30-year-old self is like, fuck that, why should i be patient?  brian mackenzie: well, that's why. yeah, you don't understand just be patient. you know, i think i was in a big rush at 30. you know, i'm 40 now, and so it's like that decade has gone by and it's like, you know, i am so - i mean, i'm like, wow, like being patient - like i am so much more patient now, and there's much more work to be done. but it's like it's just - when it's piecemeal and it's this just - okay, it makes so much more sense when you're putting stuff together.  tim ferriss: what has helped you most to become more patient?  brian mackenzie: honestly, the experience and the relationships that i have. the relationships that i used to have versus what i have now, like it's not even better inputs, they're just real people. this is really real. i have a wife that is just amazing that understands me and on a level that it's like, hey, you need to do your thing, you know, i support it. let go. like i get it. like i have crazy behavior, like, you know, i get fixated on things that i'm doing, and it's like she - she may not get it, but she gets it. and that's so hard to come by when you're 30.  i didn't know - i didn't date girls. that was my problem, you know, maybe that it was like i wasn't patient enough to date girls when i was 30 or to be involved with them at 30 that understood stuff like that. you know, to be involved with people and women like that is truly a blessing, so patience is definitely a big one at 30.  gabrielle reece: what about you?  tim ferriss: i would have told myself to start meditating; it's not just for hippies. start sitting down. rick is actually - rick urban is one of the - he and another friend - i was just going through a very anxious, rushed like aggressive period where i had a short fuse and was just, you know, rushed to get everything done.   and spoke with two close friends. one is chase jarvis, world-class photographer, amazing guy, and he was like, you know, maybe you should try tm or other types of meditation. and then i was like, 1500 bucks to get a mantra, no, thanks; that sounds like a cult. and then i had coffee with rick, and he was like have you ever thought about tm? and i'm like, goddamn it, this tm, all right, fine. but just i would have said there are many - i worry with these hypotheticals of screwing up, like causing an unintended butterfly effect in the past, so i'm like i wouldn't have changed anything, i'm not sure i want to change anything, but the - it's hard for me to see how taking 20 minutes first thing in the morning to meditate would have produced any bad results for me.  laird hamilton: that goes back to patience.  gabrielle reece: in the book that laird talks about, natural born heroes, if you're hunched forward - well, first of all, if you're hunched forward, you go into fight or flight, right?   you have a physiological response. and now that we're all on our gadgets, we're all perpetually in this position, so it creates anxiety.  brian mackenzie: we're looking around. so we're in this position and then we're - we have an instinctual thing to know what's going on around us, and we don't while we're doing it. and that just grinds on us.  gabrielle reece: so i think we're actually putting ourselves unknowingly in positions physically that are also creating an emotional response, one of them being anxiety and angst because we're not living fully or closer to our natural the way it should be.  tim ferriss: totally agree. i've been trying to take time every day at the very least, even if i'm doing a lot of writing, because i also think we're going to find a lot of visual problems with people who are only focusing between 8 and 12 inches all day long. so i try to focus on things in the distance and really take in -  laird hamilton: like solar gazing. that will be - you could work on that. that would really help your vision.   you talk about meditation, wim, you do that program, because his whole thing is about meditation. i mean, at the end, it's all these drills, but it's ultimately about meditation. it's a mechanical meditation. it's not this - it's not a swammy kind of ethereal thing where you're trying to grab something in space. this is mathematical.  brian mackenzie: and he's the first one to say i don't have the answer and this guy is going to be better at it than me and it's okay.  gabrielle reece: he'll say we don't have to get there today, we're going to do the best we can. i'm like, okay.  tim ferriss: i'll have to check him out. so if you guys could make - this will be a last question before i just ask where people can find everything you all are up to. brian, if you could make one ask of the people listening or one recommendation, what would it be?  brian mackenzie: honestly, it's like what you asked in the sauna.   it's like what's tickling your fancy. and it's the breathing, being more aware of your breathing because, quite honestly, it's exactly what gabby just brought up and we were just talking about, is when you're - you can't breathe correctly when you're here, when you're collapsed. it's all about a position, and that's basically more or less what kelly and i have really worked our careers at, is it's about position and the way you move is i understand what you're saying, like i see what's going on inside. you know, you can't lie to me at this point. so i think for me ultimately it's about breathing, and honestly that's - i would never have arrived at the meditation thing had it not been for the breathing and it being like this is fun. like i'm having a blast seeing what i get out of this and how i feel after doing this and going through this stuff. i think if people really were willing to figure - see that stuff, you know, to take the time to do that, it takes a couple weeks and then you're like, wow, this is really something like i have not thought about, regardless of what the breathing is.  tim ferriss: where would you suggest someone start with that?  brian mackenzie: i honestly think people should start with wim hoff. his method, google it. it's a cheap course for ten weeks. of course, you know, we're tweaking and playing with other things and that's what we do, but i honestly think the guy - and we'll probably get him out here at some point. the fact is, is it's like i don't care if you're a cross-fitter, if you're a professional athlete in some other sport; if you don't breathe right, you've got a fault going on. you've got something going on, and you can expand upon it and you can understand much more. you know, like i said with the eckert thing, eckert's thing is the breath because the breath is now. there's nothing after. you're not thinking about the past, you're not thinking about the future, you're focused on what's happening right now.  laird hamilton: and the breath and the spirit are as one because when the baby is slapped on the butt and take its first breath, i'm just saying that when the breath leaves, the spirit leaves.  brian mackenzie: that's the breath, is the spirit.  tim ferriss: so gabby, what would your ask or recommendation be?  gabrielle reece: well, i ask that everyone - you know, i always say that we only appreciate our health when we don't have it. and i think, you know, through injuries and things i've learned to appreciate my health. but i think, you know, sort of besides your friends and family that the most important thing to covet and take care of is yourself. it's just to the best of their ability. like if you're not walking today, go walk. if you're still smoking, you know, smoke less. like it's not about get it all done all at once, but just finding a way to make that a real priority. and then my ask would be - i always say that i'll go first.   and so that means if i'm checking out at the store, i'll say hello first. if i'm coming across somebody and make eye contact, i'll smile first. if people would experiment with that in their life a little bit, be first, because - not all times, but most times it comes in your favor. but then the response is pretty amazing. like you'll see somebody. i was at the park the other day with the kids. oh, my god. hurricane harbor, it's like hell. and there were these two women a little bit older than me. we couldn't be more different, right? and i walked by them and i just looked at them and smiled. the smile came to their face so instantly, they're ready; but you have to go first because now we're being trained in this world, nobody's going first anymore. so for me it's like take care of yourself because that also helps you go first sooner if you feel pretty good, and go first.  tim ferriss: laird?  laird hamilton: well, they went first.   tim ferriss: they did steal some good material.  laird hamilton: and i think part of - of course, the breath is - that's our food and that's what we get when we don't eat and that's our - the breath of life. and, you know, in going first and cherishing the temple, you know, i think what gabby said about going first leads to what i think, too. and again, quoting my latest favorite book natural born heroes, that the compassion, that i think compassion is - exercise compassion every day. if you could actually go out and just exercise some form of compassion, no matter what it be, i think that's some powerful stuff. i think it would be a different world if people went and were compassionate. i have to remind myself. that's an ask but that's also a do for me. i'm asking myself to do it. and again, i use that as, you know, what's good for the goose is good for the gander, which is, you know, ask what you want of yourself, and then i think it's probably - you know, it's like i like stand-up, i like foiling, i like this, you know, i like the breathing. other people will like it, too, you know. mine is - i think i'm going with the compassion.  tim ferriss: it seems like going first is a good small step in that direction.  gabrielle reece: and i think the most important thing from all of us would be don't do it - it's about each person doing it their way, that discovery, not laird's way or brian's way or gabby's way or tim's way. it's about does any of the conversation spark you to motivate you to find your way because that is the right way for you. i don't believe that any of us believe in saying this is the way. i mean, certainly breathing, it's hard to get around it. but ultimately when do you do it? how do you want to do it, whatever that is. how do you want to eat, whatever. outside, inside exercise. but it's really more about you've got to put energy into finding your way.  laird hamilton: his is physical, hers is emotional, compassion, but - and then just drinking more liquids, hydration. drink more water.  brian mackenzie: it's like be an experiment. we've gotten so far away from that, and i think this is where science has really led us because science has really gotten far off. in fact, everybody in science is trying to prove themselves right. that's not what science is. science is not about proving yourself right; science is about learning something new. and that is - if you aren't willing to experiment and learn it your way, that's how it's going to make sense. don't just try wim's way. i'm like seven different breathing techniques in at this point, which is just, you know, radical. but it's like that's where it's led to. and laird has done it as well, and that's the thing. be an experiment so that you understand what works and what doesn't.  tim ferriss: and also, i mean, what's really inspired me hanging out with all of you guys is that another way of looking at experimentation is playing. like you guys have an element of play that i think many people lose as soon as they graduate from high school or college.  gabrielle reece: i appreciate that.  laird hamilton: sometimes we have a tendency as we get older to make our play become more of a destructive process. and it's like what i said about wildman and i said about every single guy, and i guarantee you your trainer has retained his youthful enthusiasm.  tim ferriss: definitely. they both play all the time.  laird hamilton: exactly. if the mom is climbing trees, then i guarantee you that - and it's about retention of your youthful enthusiasm, that that's really what it's about, right, having fun and that spirit of that child is what will lead you to be an older child. you'll be older young, but you'll be young. you'll be young.tim ferriss: this is great. i want to close with just asking each of you where we can learn more about what you're up to, your work and so on. so brian?  brian mackenzie: i think the easiest way to get a hold of me is through - or find out more about what we're doing is through athletecell.com. you can get a hold of me there or you can find out our training information and stuff like that.   i'm most active on either twitter or instagram. like i will get active with people on twitter who behave.  tim ferriss: what's your handle?  brian mackenzie: @imunscared. tattooed on the knuckles. it's just another way of me saying i'm going to deal with humility today, i'm going to deal with fear. and it's just a constant reminder. so those are both my handles for that, and i'm pretty active on there.  tim ferriss: cool, okay. imunscared on both twitter and instagram. gabby?  gabrielle reece: well, i have a site, gabbyreece.com, but most of my energy right now is in - i've developed a curriculum called high x, and so there's highxtraining.com. there's a community fun aspect to it. anyway, so i'm putting a lot of my energy into that at the moment, so that's been my main focus.  tim ferriss: and how can people -  gabrielle reece: i am active on instagram and twitter, which will be funny when you get to laird.  tim ferriss: laird less frequent.  gabrielle reece: he's smart about that. laird, you're the smartest of us all, honey. i'm @gabbyreece on twitter and instagram.   tim ferriss: i think that the doing is still the most important, but social media can add velocity. it can lead something that is already going in the right direction. but the doing is still - i take heart. [1:51:07] the doing, it still helps us stand on the merit, but the social media stuff can definitely add velocity or add speed. so laird, where can people find - laird hamilton: you can find me in the pacific ocean.gabrielle reece: well, you have lairdhamilton.com and you're on facebook, laird life is your instagram.  laird hamilton: lairdstandup.com. but you can see some of the other stuff, like the latest - we just redid the site on gulfport.com. gulfport.com is our company that we started that's just exploding right now. the gulfports are taking over the golf courses, like stand-up is taking over the ocean. but lairdstandup. do we still have our joint stuff?  gabrielle reece: oh, gabbyandlaird.com, yeah, all our health and fitness stuff is all free. it's on gabbyandlaird.com.  tim ferriss: cool. and we'll put all these links in the show notes, guys. so if you missed anything or you lost something in your note-taking, you can check out the show notes and links and so on at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. guys, this is awesome. thanks so much. this is fantastic. everybody, check out what they're up to, say hi to them on the webs, be nice, and play. until next time, thanks for listening.", "speakers": ["laird hamilton", " gabrielle reece", " brian mackenzie", "tim ferriss"], "text_sentences": ["hello, ladies and germs", "this is tim ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show, where i deconstruct world-class performers to tease out and pull out the routines, the habits, the breakfasts, the favorite books, the behaviors and so on that you can use in your own life, borrow from these individuals who have achieved the pinnacle of whatever their chosen field might be, whether that's chess, hedge fund managing, sports, acting, government, you name it, military, it goes on and on", "and in this particular episode, we have a foursome that is very exciting, folks, and i was very nervous about the tech in managing all of the cables and so on, but it turned out even better than i could have possibly hoped", "it was after a workout with these people who all could kick my ass in so many ways it is impossible to count, and that is a good thing because if you are the strongest person in the room, if you are the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room", "and we have three people", "so we have first laird hamilton, who is widely considered the greatest big-wave surfer of all time", "he is also a very innovative influencer in modern board sports and surfing, so he is considered either the creator or certainly popularizer of tow-in surfing, which allows him and now many, many other people to surf waves bigger than ever before possible and is largely responsible for the rebirth of standup paddle boarding", "if you've seen people stand up paddle boarding, chances are on some level you have laird to thank for it", "laird has starred in many surfing films and was the centerpiece of riding giants, a documentary about big-wave surfing, which if you have not seen, you have to see", "it will make your palms sweat within the first few minutes", "it's insanity", "and he's also considered the rider of the heaviest wave of all time, or at least at the time that surfing magazine had him on the cover, and the only caption was, \"oh, my god.\"    so he's been a contributing editor for men's journal; he's been on oprah, charlie rose, 60 minutes, the ellen degeneres show, and he's also very well known, and i admire larry for this, for using his lifestyle and his skillset to raise money for charities, including race across america, pipeline for a cure for cystic fibrosis, raincatcher, and muscular dystrophy, et cetera", "he's an awesome dude", "and the only person perhaps as intimidatingly awesome is his wife, gabrielle reece", "gabby has been named one of the 20 most influential women in sports and is best known for her fantastic success in volleyball; but she's of course also done model, she's had starring roles as a trainer on the biggest loser, and reece is just incredible", "and i've had a chance to work out with gabby", "she is every bit as incredible as laird, and they're both about a foot taller than i am, but let's not go there", "that's okay", "i feel okay in my gnomish-like stature", "in any case, gabby has also used her crossover success in these different fields to become the first female athlete to ever design a shoe for nike, and she now serves as a fitness expert for yahoo", "health, among many, many other things", "the last person in our little menage-a-four - i don't know how to say that in french - is brian mackenzie", "he is the founder of crossfit endurance and the author of the new york times best-selling book unbreakable runner", "brian has created a lot of controversy, and he was featured in the four hour body for a lot of it, by suggesting a very counterintuitive approach to distance running, in which he challenges high-mileage runs, high-carb diets, and incorporates a lot of intense strength training, in some cases very brief strength training to conquer everything from 5ks to ultra-marathons", "and many of you out there have used his protocol, his sort of 8-week to 12-week protocol in four hour body to go from running nothing to running marathons and ultra-marathons in record time", "so congratulations", "and laird, for those of you who didn't see it, was also one of my surfing coaches in the tim ferriss experiment, so just check that out, itunes.com/timferriss, two rs and two ss", "and without further ado, here is laird, gabby, and brian", "guys, welcome to the show", "i'm so thrilled to have you guys here", "and i thought that we could just start off with a description of what just happened because i came in here this morning terrified of this workout - and brian had something else in mind", "and i came out of the workout really exhausted, feeling great, and having done things in the workout i didn't think i was capable of", "and i was hoping, laird, maybe you could just describe the training a little bit", "that seems like a perfect scenario", "no, i was very surprised", "yeah, it did all those things", "well, ultimately i think it's about challenging your beliefs, but also challenging your - you know, your physicality", "so, i mean, within that scenario of, you know, the things that we've done, which we're thermo-regulating the heat, the ice, the pool, the lack of breath, the effort of swimming and jumping and, you know, all the physical stuff, i mean, there's just so many things happening simultaneously, i think it really is about just complete confusion", "yeah", "and what i also realized, for those people that are not familiar with laird's pool - and why would you be - there are stairs", "there's a staircase built into the middle of the pool so that people can walk down, but then you might thing, well, wouldn't you just float up to the surface", "but you have everyone weighed down with giant dumbbells", "with giant dumbbells", "well, it's got a set of steps that brings you into the pool; these are steps that are underwater in the middle of the pool", "correct", "yeah, correct", "and what i realized -  for when it's empty", "right", "so you can do your workouts in the pool and -  it's that far down", "so gabby, you gave me some very good advice", "i just remember holding dumbbells and you were like, \"your eyes don't need to be as wide open.\" i just looked like, i don't know, a cat in a corner i guess probably, bug-eyed", "and faster is not better, and i was hoping maybe you could just elaborate on that because i think it's a really interesting concept that translates not just to the workout in the pool but to a lot of things", "gabrielle reece: well, we were just saying that earlier, that it's very true to life that it is more about with purpose and with a calm manner at times can actually be more effective", "and so the water really exaggerates all of that and also forces you to sort of yield to that method", "and so really just looking around takes up oxygen, and so - and actually you did very well today, so you have to give yourself some credit", "but a lot of times we're so focused and our eyes open, like when you play land sports and you go to focus, you do open your eyes", "it's a focus mechanism, right", "right", "gabrielle reece: but in the pool it's quite opposite where you have to relax everything that you can relax so all the air goes to the places that are doing the work", "right, your eyes, your jaw, everything has to relax", "gabrielle reece: everything", "and then it's moving in a way that it's what amount of oxygen are you giving up for the amount of effort you're putting in and finding that sort of sweet spot of this effort, especially when you're not doing like really heavy, heavy weight and it's more about the breath-holding", "definitely", "and i was - you know, brian, we were chatting a couple days ago when i was doing one of my usual walks in san francisco, and you got me very excited about the pool training, obviously", "and rick, who we both know, rick ruben, who's been on the podcast, has talked about this", "you were talking about using the mask that i now have, as well as this training", "and when i asked you what you were most excited about these days, one of the answers was the breath training", "and i'd just love to hear what you were doing with the breath training, some of the results you've seen, because it's such a fundamental aspect of all life and sports", "but having been exposed to like wim hof and somebody that's sort of come to the forefront of my mind, but this is my first time ever really playing around with it, of doing an exhale, then trying to swim lengths of a pool, which is completely different", "but what has been your experience and how are you doing some of that training", "brian mackenzie: well, i first was given that training mask by a buddy of mine named ki.elevation training mask", "brian mackenzie: yeah, elevation training mask", "and, you know, i looked at it and i was a little weirded out by it; but with anything i get, i'm like i'm going to screw around with it, and if it makes sense for me to screw around with it, i'll continue to screw around with it", "if it doesn't, i'll toss it", "and i immediately got a response out of my diaphragm like when i took a breath", "had to use your diaphragm", "brian mackenzie: had to use my diaphragm", "and for those people who don't have the visual, the mask, i guess it looks almost like a mask you could use - right, a mask for construction; you have the ventilation", "you can change the amount of airflow that's permitted", "brian mackenzie: correct", "so their whole scheme is from like 3,000 feet to 18,000 feet, and you can change all of those settings", "laird likes to play around with it a little further, which is typical, which is good, you know", "that's so unlike him", "brian mackenzie: hey, i know, it's very unlike him", "so anyway, i got a quick understanding of this mask, and i saw something that i have seen fault him with every athlete i've really ever worked with, is like when you see a spinal fault or you see a mechanical fault -  fault meaning their posture is off", "brian mackenzie: yeah, posture is off, position is off", "so if i'm - and i'm making a quarter extremity violation, i am literally probably most likely making that fault with spinal mechanics", "a quarter extremity violation meaning one of your limbs is doing something funny", "brian mackenzie: now your limb is actually compensating for making up for the lack of stability that's going on here", "so think of being overextended or being flexed too far forward", "if i flex too far forward, i run into a wall when i breathe", "if i overextend, i run into a wall when i'm breathing", "if i don't, i can breathe.iand this showed me immediately that i could get people who did not understand this concept, which is a very hard thing to come by - i mean, we could talk about it right now, and people are probably like, okay, whatever, you know", "but if i put the mask on, i immediately go to my nose, so i'm using my nose to breathe, which is, yes, you should be drawing in your breath for most of your breathing through your nose, and you're forcing that diaphragm to work", "so getting that concept down and then being introduced to laird and gabby through my friend ki, i came up here", "and it was just - it's exactly like laird said; you know, it's mask infusion", "we're kind of tossing the entire nuts and bolts at you, and then it's exactly as gabby is explaining in the fact that it's like, look, you actually have to be conscious of what's really going on and controlled and like, hey, where are you focused", "the energy of, \"oh, my god,\" that facial expression it literally costing you energy", "that costs", "that costs you reps, yeah", "that can cost you reps", "gabrielle reece: or getting to the other side and then all your friends see you not make it", "and this has made more sense to me in being not only somebody who is a competitor swimmer, somebody who's a coach, somebody who's worked - i specialize in movement, but you have to work - you will get efficient in that pool very quickly", "brian mackenzie: right, because all of the - any energy leak is exaggerated", "yes", "brian mackenzie: and just so people have a visual once again, the first exercise we did in the pool, i guess i had - i want to say started with 15-pound weights, dumbbells, and then moved up", "but you're sort of sinking to the bottom of the pool and then doing a shoulder press as you jump up to the surface of the pool, and then you're bringing your arms down to your sides, almost like you're swimming a stroke, like a jumping jack in a big circle", "that's when you take the breath at the top", "and so immediately i was like, oh, i'm holding my breath underwater, but i have to start exhaling as soon as i go underwater; otherwise, i'm going to have to exhale and inhale at the top, and that's when i'm going to swallow water.and it's also going to shorten your amount of air you can get in if you have to blow out, which is all, again, counterintuitive", "[overlapping comments]  the learning curve was so fascinating to me because, even after 10 reps or 15 reps, i was like, oh, that thing that i was freaking out about on rep three or four, completely unnecessary, right", "and then, gabby, i think you mentioned this to me as i was doing one of the exercises i was even more terrified of, which was holding a dumbbell to my chest and swimming underwater back and forth", "brian mackenzie: ammo box", "the ammo box", "is if you feel like you can't make it, exhale a little bit, which is so counterintuitive", "gabrielle reece: i know", "and you make room, too", "brian mackenzie: yeah", "well, it also gives you time because your brain goes, well, i'm exhaling, i'm going to be inhaling", "so your brain, again, it's a bit of a confusion, like you confuse yourself", "you confuse your instincts, right, like the breath-holding exhale drill", "you want to breathe in", "as soon as you exhale, you have a mechanism that's designed to breathe in because you have pressure on the diaphragm", "you want to breathe in", "but once you teach the body to resist against that and know it's okay, that you're not going to breathe in right now because you still have the oxygen, then it leads you to a new place", "and what is - now, we've drained these glasses", "but laird, can you elaborate on this very potent yellow elixir", "gabrielle reece: it's good, isn't it", "it is good", "[overlapping comments] so we were doing the in-pool exercises and then we would do ice bath for at least three months and then about 15 minutes' minimum in the hot box", "so i was about to take - i felt like i was ready for a nap, and then i had this magic concoction", "what is in this beverage", "well, that was fresh-squeezed turmeric root", "yeah, and you have a whole box of this turmeric root", "gabrielle reece: it was sent from kauai, but you can get it at the store", "but fresh-squeezed turmeric root, liquid pepper extract, and then raw honey and apple cider vinegar", "gabrielle reece: and water", "that was fully diluted, by the way", "no, that's intense, yeah, but i really enjoyed it", "and you also showed me something earlier, which is about the size of a large cat", "it is a mushroom", "what type of mushroom is this", "yeah, it's called a chaga", "chaga", "pretty uncommon, hard to find from what i understand", "yeah, rare more because it's unknown, but also its uniqueness of the habitat it comes from and then the ability to use it", "most people just don't know about it, so it's - but it's the most powerful mushroom in the world", "they say the spores are found in the stratosphere", "they found chaga spores like in the stratosphere in space", "gabrielle reece: well, isn't it the only mushroom, too, that grows on a living organism", "yes", "yeah", "and doesn't take from it", "it's not living - it's not a parasite, yeah", "it's actually supplying - a symbiotic relationship", "i think today's show, the theme for me has just been fear so far, my own fear", "so i'd love to talk about that just a little bit", "all three of you i think have sort of befriended fear in some ways", "so gabby, when you were competing, or even now, obviously world-class athlete, what was your self-talk like before a big match or before a big event", "how do you prepare yourself for that?i'm not going to answer for her, but i want to preface, i want to help you out with the question because i met gabby on a show called the extremist, and she was the host when i met her", "and she came to interview me, and she'd already interviewed like 60 other people and gotten an aspect of their sport", "so for her, before a match in volleyball, like i respect that as an athlete, but for her to go out and jump out of a plane, to go hang-gliding, riding on some crazy dragster bike, i mean, these are - because you're going into - i think, i mean, you can ask her the question; she can answer it instead of me", "but ultimately ask her the question of what was heavier, like before a big match that you were going to play or like get on a drag bike that you'd never been on and release the clutch and go zero to 60 in a second", "no, that's helpful", "that's very helpful", "so i feel like even more of a weakling and coward than i did before i asked the question, but let me - i have to say that when you practice many hours and you dedicate a lot of time to something, it does have a different value", "you know, if i was doing mtv sports or the extremist, there was a margin of \u00f4i'm going to do the best i can.' and certainly, you know, laird always jokes that if there's like something on the line, then i'm very good, like really focused", "like if you said to me, \"hey, gabrielle, let's go for a mountain bike ride and we're going to go for like three hours, it's totally routed and extreme downhill,\" i'd be like \u00f4i'm good.' but if you said, hey, there's this point and purpose, i would do it then", "so i'm a little different that way", "you need the stakes or the incentive", "gabrielle reece: kind of", "and that's maybe not great actually, to be honest with you", "so volleyball, i had a different emotional attachment because i invested a lot of time and it meant a lot to me", "so i had a different expectation going into it", "i would kind of go through a ritual that would get me into a different head space where i was switching from, you know, me as a person to me the competitor, but -  what did the ritual look like", "gabrielle reece: you know, it was sort of like the hair goes up in a ponytail and then you start putting sunblock on and then i'd clean my glasses, i'd put those on", "it was all very thought out", "i would detach away from everyone except my teammates", "how long did that pre-game ritual last", "gabrielle reece: i didn't need long, like maybe 15, 20 minutes", "i was superstitious, too", "i would never compete in the color red", "if i wore something and played badly, i would not use that visor or hair tie or pair of glasses again", "so i did have those weird things; but i think like any athlete will tell you, there are certain things that i wish i had been better at", "it took me - i think having children has made me less concerned with making everybody happy", "and i think even when i was competing; i was really concerned about how people felt", "so that was hard because it's hard to try to be, oh, you're trying to kick ass, but then you're worried about how people feel", "it's a wide dynamic", "so i would change personality, but i will truthfully say that i also - i think i held myself back", "so coming back to the parenting comment, so having kids has made you care less about what people think", "gabrielle reece: well, you just straight get meaner because you have no time", "to people outside of your kids or to the kids also", "gabrielle reece: everybody", "okay", "gabrielle reece: no, i think - no, because we have less time", "and also as a woman, we're taught as young girls, hey, be nice, nice girls act like this", "and so it takes a long time to get to a place to go, okay, i'm going to do things, say things, and believe in things that people aren't going to like, and i'm going to be okay with that", "it takes - men do that so much easier, and it takes women a very long time", "and the only athletes i've seen that do it very easily are generally the youngest girl with all older brothers", "they understand it's not personal much sooner than girls", "and so, you know - and the other thing i would say is i wasn't really groomed to be a champion", "like terry walsh, for example, her whole life was groomed", "she was told at an early age you're a winner, you can win, it's okay to win, expect to win", "i fell into winning and learning to win, and so that was another thing i had to overcome", "how did you fall into winning", "gabrielle reece: by being really tall and being decently athletic and getting into sports", "but you didn't have the sort of familial support", "gabrielle reece: i didn't at all, and i was a late bloomer and all these things", "so it was all like, well, is it okay to win and like it's kind of going good", "like it was all that weird sort of things that you had to overcome", "so i think there are a lot of things you learn, and children put things into real perspective for you", "age puts things into perspective, and those usually happen kind of simultaneous", "and again, you have less time, so you kind of cut through the crap", "brian, so you've worked with a lot of athletes", "you know a lot of world-class coaches, and you've traveled a ton", "when you think of the word \"successful,\" who is the first person that comes to mind", "brian mackenzie: well, these two are easily at that list", "gabrielle reece: that's because we're sitting here", "brian mackenzie: well, you asked the question and i'm sitting in front of two - how about his wife", "he has a badass wife", "brian mackenzie: my wife, you know", "[overlapping comments]  so what are the characteristics", "why do you - without knowing who they were or what they - i knew who laird was, i knew who gabby was", "but irrelevant to the situation in what i was brought into and how i met them, and at the top of that sits happiness", "you take away the financial side of stuff, you take away the extreme, you take away the - like, hey, i was at the pinnacle of sport, like i was - you know, i was world-class athlete", "you take that away, and you see how a dynamic is working and you see how people are functioning", "and they're happy, they're surrounded by people who are happy", "they are - it's an ecosystem in itself", "so i think that's - you know, it's easy to just say that because they're sitting right here, you know, and because it's the truth", "you know, i know plenty of people like that, but i also know plenty of people that are miserable, that, you know, you would say, oh, they're so successful, and it's like, hmm, what do you consider -  yeah, right", "if you use the bank account maybe", "brian mackenzie: yeah, the bank account or like - even like just behavior, like behavior of like i'm threatened by you, i'm insecure about this", "it's like, yeah, you've got some stuff to work on still", "i'm not in a situation like i've got to exit from this", "it just doesn't work enough for me", "so happiness, let's talk about that for a second because one thing that really struck me and why i like hanging out with you guys also and wanted to hang out more was when i was filming for the tim ferriss experiment we did this surfing episode, which was a blast", "and thank you guys both for putting up with me for that period of time, putting up with me now also", "but the memory that comes to me when people are like, oh, what was it like hanging out with them, and it's the time at home when you were joking around with the kids and like doing the steam baths and the ice baths", "i was like, you know, it's not just the really, really, really good athletes who had maintained an unbelievable level of physical performance; it's that you seem to have a very kind of integrated life as spouses and then with the kids", "but you obviously had some challenges growing up", "it wasn't easy", "what have you, laird, like how have you guys thought about parenting and what you are trying to do differently with your kids", "well, i think for everyone you maybe want to be the parent that you didn't have or maybe you want to be the parent you think you wanted", "you know, you also - of course, depending on the relationship with your parents, if you had an incredible one, then you want to try to be the parent that you had", "so there was parents i - you know, some of the parents i had were parents i did want to be and some of the parents i had were parents i didn't want to be", "and so, you know, you try to - you know, you try to do the best you can", "i mean, you go from your instincts; you go from your heart", "i mean, when you really look at it, when i - if i look at the most important thing for me in parenting, being parented as a young child was being loved", "it was like being loved was probably - and if i can just - you know, loving your children can override a lot of wrongs.yeah", "how do you demonstrate that", "it sounds like a weird question, but i know a lot of smart people who are just not good parents", "they try, but they're not good", "gabrielle reece: we do it different", "so like, for example, reece, our middle daughter who is more similar to laird and very emotional, she would be going through something", "thank you", "gabrielle reece: no, she is", "straight up", "and our younger daughter more similar to gabby is a ruthless killer", "gabrielle reece: true", "anyway, so reece would be like upset about something, and i'd be like, well, let's talk about it, how are you feeling, what's going on, you know", "laird would walk in the room, kind of take one look at her and just grab her and put her on the floor and hug her, right", "and so i think one thing that we've learned is we try our best to be an ally friend", "we never let the kids feel like they can wedge between us ever", "so that's very helpful", "and i think, believe it or not, laird is more touchy-feely, love them, you know", "well, they're also girls", "i mean, if we had some sons, you might be - there might be a different relationship", "gabrielle reece: maybe, that's true", "because it's male-female", "daddy's little girls and mommy's little boys", "it's just the nature of the dynamic", "i mean, i had a mother that i had an incredible relationship with, and you just have that male-female connection", "gabrielle reece: yeah", "so i think you have that, and then, you know, i make sure like i understand the nuances, like their favorite - they need this certain clothing and like lessons and then they can talk to me about their girl stuff", "and, you know, they know i'm not going to surprise them", "but we're inclusive, too, and we treat them like adults", "we've always spoken to them like adults", "we treat them like an adultyou know, where they say treat them like an honored guest if they don't act like one, you know, but ultimately we treat them, we take them with us", "when we go, we all go together.iand when we go to eat somewhere, i mean, we go to dinner parties where no one brings their kids, but we bring our kids because they're just - otherwise we don't go", "and people that invite us know that, hey, if they come, they're coming", "gabrielle reece: it's our family", "and we're tough on them", "we're tough on them", "we're -  in what ways are you tough on them", "gabrielle reece: i mean, we're just - like if they do something that could be perceived as not using really good judgment, there's no like, well, honey, you know we don't do that in this house", "it's straight up like \u00f4what are you doing?' you know, so i think there's a direct - we have a very direct style of parenting, which thank goodness our children are a certain way because for me personally my kids are very stubborn and strong-willed and everything else", "but it would be much harder for me if i had a kid that was - that i'd have to coddle more because i don't know that verbiage as well", "but listen, i've had to say i'm sorry many times", "that's another thing you learn as a parent, you have to learn to say sorry because you blow it", "so you can - sometimes you can go, hey, you know what, i am extra tired today and my fuse is short and i am being unfair to you, and i'm sorry", "like you have to learn that you're imperfect and kind of open that door up, too", "like there are times that you go, hey - you know, i always say to my girls do you feel loved enough, you know, because you want to know", "and they're like, oh, come on, mom", "but i think you should ask", "yeah", "well, just asking says a lot, right", "even if they like brush it off, like i would imagine kids -  well, it's also respect", "by asking them, respect", "and also you're showing them it's okay to not be perfect because we're not perfect either", "so we're not demanding some perfect out of them which is totally unattainable", "who can do that", "gabrielle reece: but having said that, like right now our almost 20-year-old daughter, she doesn't love us right now", "straight up, like she doesn't - she's not loving us right now", "so okay", "so it's not like ooh, la, la, la", "and it's interesting, brian's comment talking about, you know, having that happiness or contentment is a sign of success", "and i always said as a parent, to be a successful parent would be that you could raise a content human because i don't know that many", "so if you could actually be a parent that raises a content human, good parenting", "yeah", "and what i've also noticed, just with you guys - and then, brian, i want to get your take on a bunch of things - is that you have - you mentioned the kind of wrestling to the ground", "you have a very physical relationship with your kids", "and i think it's - no, no, no, but it's like it's a very - as someone who's only recently gotten back into physical play, doing stuff like yoga, it's been incredibly effective at anxiety reduction, relaxation, and just feeling grounded and connected to other people", "so i think that that's also something that has struck me, is just how you use a lot of physical interaction with your kids", "gabrielle reece: but think about hawaii, too", "like if you - if my kids are here and you go to leave, they're going to get up and walk you to the door and say goodbye", "in hawaii, when you see an auntie or an uncle, you give them a hug", "there's a touching component of like tactile and think about even animals, right", "like if my kid does something, i'm going to grab her arm", "like even if it's, you know, physical in play, but it's just physical like we're connecting", "and i also think that the physical is a reflection of the emotional, you know, because if you do yoga and it's an intense position and you're having all this stuff, but this is for spiritual enlightenment", "this is to come to a higher level of consciousness, but it's a physical act", "so in a way, this physical relationship we have makes them mentally stronger, makes them mentally - you know, all these things are just reflection, these physical reflections of these emotional states", "so all of a sudden emotionally they're a lot more open and doing things and i want to be tough and all that stuff", "well, it's like the training in the pool earlier, same element of transfer", "brian, you looked like you had something to say", "i do have another question for you also", "brian mackenzie: well, i think this all adds to - this is happiness", "this is - they're having fun with their kids", "there's only really a couple other people, and other person that really comes to mind in the same way that there's a family like this, is kelly", "and everything - i mean, i'm a part of that family", "like i am literally - i don't live there anymore", "i used to live five doors down", "but i'd go up there; i'd stay at the house", "i'm with the girls, i help the girls get ready", "i'll take them to school", "the whole process is this whole auntie-uncle, this whole thing of being happy and are we having fun", "if we're not having fun, what are we doing", "gabrielle reece: but they seem even happier than we are", "sometimes i feel like laird and i are like rough around the edges a little bit", "like, you know, there are no secrets and it's kind of - you know, like i feel like when i see kelly, it feels like lighter and nicer", "i envy that in some people", "brian mackenzie: but kelly is kelly, but you two, there has been very rare that i have seen almost a - the same type of dynamic happening where you have a husband-wife combination that is - that works in the dynamic that it does", "well, here's a question for you: so the two examples that you brought up, right, kelly and juliet, the two of you, they work out together, right", "and so people say sometimes, you know, those who work out together stay together", "can you think of anybody offhand who does not exercise together, spouses who are very happy in the same way", "can you guys", "i'm just curious", "gabrielle reece: yeah", "you can", "gabrielle reece: because i have friends, they function better when the two live their worlds and then they come together because in a way, even though laird and i are independent, i think we both need that touchstone with each other", "and it isn't maybe even the training because the joke is the only time we train together is in the pool because it's underwater and we can't talk, because we don't train together on the land", "like laird is my confidante and someone that i go to to get - bounce ideas off or a mentor in other ways, but we don't actually train together", "too many - too bossy, both", "so that's the running joke", "like we don't - so the pool is cool because -  her class is too hard", "gabrielle reece: oh, yeah, right", "like the joke is like we can train in the pool because we're under the water", "because you can't smack-talk", "gabrielle reece: or just like we should do it like this; no, i should do it like that", "you don't -  when we used to play volleyball, i used to be the practice dummy", "i would ride home in the back of the truck with the dogs", "gabrielle reece: yeah, because we'd fight", "like i would be in the back with the dogs in the truck", "gabrielle reece: and i'd be driving the car; i'm like that (mumbling) underneath my breath", "and laird would be sitting there and one of the dogs would be licking his face and he'd be pissed", "and my team like would win on some bad call, and he'd be like, oh, you girls feel good about winning like that", "and we're like, yeah, like you don't get it, like any way to win", "and laird just can't understand that", "so to be honest, like let's not glorify it", "we do things together, but there's a lot of space because when you - days are long and when you're - and years, right", "like we're going on 20 years", "it's like you have to find that pace", "and there are some people, if they had 9-to-5 jobs, maybe they should train together", "so we have a different deal, right", "but the number one thing in all successful relationships, 10,000 couples, there's only one thing that everybody had in common, no matter what the dynamic, because there's all the different dynamics", "one thing only", "what is it", "great sex", "gabrielle reece: that's a good call", "that's a good call", "that was probably the second", "the first thing, that the man respected the woman", "the number one thing, and i guarantee you that kelly respects his wife", "i guarantee you", "[overlapping comments] so right there, those three couples, right away the man respects - but can i say one thing", "and i know all those dynamics differ, like the woman's the breadwinner, the man's the breadwinner, she's dominant, he's dominant, whatever; but ultimately more times than not is if the woman can refrain from trying to change or mother her partner, she has a greater opportunity of putting herself in a position where the guy will respect you", "brian mackenzie: it's just - it's support", "gabrielle reece: that's it", "brian mackenzie: it's support", "gabrielle reece: a man needs support", "i mean, i love you guys and you're all strong, but you're very fragile, and you need to be like supported and help you fully realize your voice, whatever that is", "brian mackenzie: of course, because we're expendable and so we have to go out and die for you at some point, so we better be getting supported", "you better support me because i'm going to go run in front of tyrannosaurus rex for you", "so how do you best support - as a woman how do you best support your male counter -  your partner", "yeah, partner, without mothering", "what's the - well, i had a great education, first and foremost", "i'll be honest with you, i picked a partner who there was just no chance in hell, right", "so laird said to me the first couple years we were together - and unfortunately, his mom passed away the second year we were together", "i had a mom, and she died; and he made it very clear", "so what it did is it let me off the hook", "meaning i don't need another - don't mother me", "and so what it did is it made me switch my brain right then where, hey, that's off the table, because women by nature, we can't help it, we're nurturers, right", "so sometimes that seeps over, like, hey, honey, that joke was kind of inappropriate at the dinner table, you're talking kind of loud, all that", "and then what happens is we somehow - because the man's trying to be loving and stuff", "they pacify us and then they change all the ways we want them to, and then we don't want them", "so it's a great thing where you just say, hey, i'm going to pick a partner that i feel like our value system is similar, we may get there very differently, but our - kind of how we wind up on some of the big items are the same", "and also what you learn is, for example, laird is - when you're with laird, you feel really loved", "like when he directs that at you, it's for real, right", "but it's connected to i'm restless; i need adventure, all these other things", "so you sort of say - you start to understand, hey, these things over here that make this person who they are, i'm going to love all of it", "ignore the fact that he talks over me and, you know - yeah, these are small things, because you have to start looking at the big things, you know, like they're doing the best they can, they're honest", "you know, it's like all these important things", "and you let it ride", "oh, yeah, the hair, that's another story", "when i was like - i think i was 27 or -8, and laird said to me - i had said something about, you know, i took things way more personal", "of course, you do", "and you go, oh, yeah, that's not my thing", "he said - i said something, and laird goes, yeah, but i'm here every night", "and in my mind, i thought, well, duh, i'm here every night, too", "but i didn't really know what that meant", "for a man to say, hey, i'm going to really try to be with one woman, they're giving you all - most of what they've got", "they're giving you like 80 percent", "and for a woman, maybe she's giving you 35", "so it's like to understand, too, like understand people's language on how they give", "let's say i was very shy and i came out and i was having a very nice, you know, sort of conversation with you", "maybe i'm giving you 200 percent because of my nature", "so i think it's also starting to understand like, who they are, they're giving how they can give, and receiving it that way", "but don't try to change them because i always tell my friends if you want to be with a king, you have to treat them like a king", "and if you're always like, no, i don't want to do that, they're a pile in the corner", "exactly", "brian, let me shift gears for a second here", "what is the - this is going to be a jarring transition, but it's my specialty as an interviewer, awkward segues", "your most gifted book, what book", "and i'm going to ask you guys the same question", "what book or books have you gifted the most to other people", "brian mackenzie: it's probably between two.i[indiscernible] or the - it's dan millman", "way of the peaceful warrior", "that's like a starter for anybody like i mentor or i work with, like who's looking -  why is that a starter", "what - because it takes you from a basic like, hey, here's what's going on to like here's like potential, here's ultimate potential", "like you can't fathom that", "you continue to put one foot in front of the other, you can achieve these things; you can do what you set your mind out to, if you're willing to take those steps", "it may not happen tomorrow, but it can happen", "and i think [indiscernible] is just - once you get to a certain level, it's like, wow, like every little piece is like, whoa", "layers upon layers upon layers", "brian mackenzie: that can make sense at any point of the day for me at this point, and that's i think the beauty in it", "cool", "thank you", "gabby", "gabrielle reece: oh, my goodness", "i think - you know, this sounds ridiculous, but i read atlas shrugged when i was 15, and i gave that book to a lot of people because it shifted just sort of how i looked at certain things", "and obviously on the simple read, i think i've given the alchemist to quite a lot of young people because it's that reminder as you go out in the world and you're looking for all these things that sometimes it is within us or right - you know, again, we laugh like we're back on kauai", "laird grew up in kauai", "you know, it's like you go around the whole world", "sometimes what you're looking for is right in front of you", "gabrielle reece: yeah, and i think it's more true to the idea of even something about yourself or marriage or whatever", "it's like it's just right there", "you just have to work at it", "with atlas shrugged, it's very popular in silicon valley of course", "gabrielle reece: is it", "it's very, very popular", "gabrielle reece: well, i was 15 when i read that book.that's a big book", "gabrielle reece: i was a much heavier person when i was younger", "i've lightened up a lot", "what did - i mean, is that still a book that you would gift to people or was that just for a period of time", "gabrielle reece: i think i was in my \"the world is not as it seems\" phase in my life, you know, probably until i was about 23 or -4", "but i think it's just sort of a good reminder about - it's not about not taking things at face value, but it's about maybe creating your own truth because we don't - we can't really figure out any other truth", "right, and objective truth that applies to everyone", "gabrielle reece: right", "so i think i certainly would give it now, but maybe i would give other books now", "tim ferris: got it", "laird", "well, i'm going to go big here", "at one point i felt there was only one book in my opinion in the world, which was the bible", "and i've been through it quite a few times", "and you were raised religious", "no", "you were not", "no", "but that's where i found the truth, and i found that - and i didn't gift it as much as that i gifted the teachings in it, and i think the parables are such a - i love parable teaching because it's so tangible", "but when you look at just the basis of what - you know, what i find is that when you find the truth, it doesn't matter what the religion is because the truth is a golden thread that winds its way through all kinds of stuff", "and so that just was the first book that i found a lot of truth in it, and then i was able to share that with people, parables", "and then you run into so many situations in your life", "and if you just look at basically the ten commandments and you live that way, it would increase the quality of your life", "now, you know, as a young kid, books that had the most influence on me, you know, i mean, the lord of the rings was like a huge thing", "when i was young, my mom read those books to me before i could even read, and so i went through the trilogy of those as a young man and, you know, jonathan liebesman, [indiscernible] and the doom and all these other fantasy books", "but the bible really - i mean, that thing just had - you know, then now if you ask me today like what book am i gifting everybody today, i'm gifting natural born heroes", "you know, like that's my book of the - yeah, they have a man book club", "in the gym", "we train together and we have a book of the week or the book of the month", "and whoever gets one, we go and - you know, of course rick's always a big contributor to -   [overlapping comments]  everybody's contributing, you know", "deep survival is another great -  deep survival", "yeah, laurence gonzales", "that's an incredible book in speaking about just fear and dealing with fear", "but this natural born heroes is my - that's my latest kind of craze, just because of - you know, again, but all of these, all - you know, no fiction stuff", "nonfiction truth", "the way my mind works, i don't want - i don't want - i mean, it's almost like i had the fiction when i was young to create imagination and fantasy, but really what i hunger is truth, like what is the truth, what are facts, give me information that i can apply", "i want to be able to apply this stuff to life", "so here's a question about some truth and testing truth that i'm really curious to ask you, and that is - you're into testing stuff", "you know, every once in a while", "every once in a while when i'm walking around with a drip bag attached to me, occasionally", "you're known as an innovator in the sort of water sports world, whether it's tow-in surfing, foil board, or any number of other things", "[overlapping comments]but he's evolved, he's grown legs", "moved on to land", "what has enabled you to contribute in that way", "because people have been playing in the water for a very long time", "what is the - what are the characteristics or the moments that led to you being able to have these breakthroughs or contribute to these innovations", "i think a combination of a couple of things", "i think there's a little bit of a formula that i've been fortunate enough to be subjected to, to how i was raised and then, you know, like again being exposed to the lord of the rings and doom and some of these really incredible imagination - sort of development of imagination", "you know, thomas edison is quoted as saying, you know, all you need to be an inventor is an imagination and a pile of junk", "and so, you know, i lived at the end of a road where you didn't call people to fix stuff; you fixed it and, you know, you didn't have anything that was - you couldn't go buy stuff", "you had to make stuff", "and so, you know, and then i grew up in a way where i was - you know, there was a racial thing because i was not liked for how i was born", "so then i would be like, well, why would i be worried about what people think when i do something that makes them upset", "they're already upset", "they're upset for how i was born", "so some of those things, you know, where you have an imagination and you're willing to subject yourself to failure, that's a big part of it, of any innovation", "you've got to be willing to crash and burn and at the cost of looking like a fool, people laughing at you and not letting that dictate what you do", "i think peer pressure - you know, if it was up to other people they wouldn't let you do anything", "no one would create anything because that's just stupid, whether it's your dad or, you know, i mean, i used to have - you know, i had a teacher tell me once in school you can't eat your surfboard", "oh, meaning like that's not going to pay the bills", "no", "you're never going to make a life out of using that or - i'm just saying those are all the, you know -  worst advice ever", "so i think those are a lot of the factors, right", "those are the key elements", "i think if you look at anybody who's willing to subject themselves to failure and -gabrielle reece: and relentless pursuit", "understand once they're in the wheelhouse, it is like not going away", "you can talk about it and write it down and do it again", "[overlapping comments] well, it's weird because it isn't - it's weird", "it's not so destructively obsessive, but it's just this tone that you kind of notice you've got; it's still there, huh", "is stand-up paddling", "so 1998 or -7 or so, laird decided, oh, i'm going to, you know, try the - it's another way to train", "he was on a long board using kayak paddles and then taping handles", "and then before you know it, we're driving to some guy's house that he's asked to - milama, is that who it was", "on maui", "like extended wooden paddle, so he did for the canoe paddlers in hawaii", "so laird went to him and said, oh, can you make it longer", "and then breaking that one and breaking another one and then, you know, just trying new boards and, oh, that guy doesn't have boards, blanks big enough for a stand-up paddle board, so i've got to find a guy", "oh, there's a guy in san diego", "just like going nonstop, nonstop, break things, go out, and just - and then on top of it, do it every day, like down-winder, you know, another down-winder", "what's a down-winder", "gabrielle reece: so in maui when it's too windy, you know, to surf maybe, that means the wind is probably up", "and in maui, it's very windy", "so he gets dropped off at one point and then goes with the wind down", "with stand-up paddling, that was really one of the best first things that he used it for", "and then, you know, he incorporated surfing later", "but, i mean, just persistent and constant, every day", "even foiling", "i really - if i look at foiling, it's like laird ultimately has been practicing rigorously for the last seven years, quietly, patiently, to get a ride and maybe another ride coming but a ride that he had this winter on a wave that he's been secretly thinking about probably for 40 years of his life", "so there's a patience but a relentlessness that i'm like, wow, that is - kudos to you that you hang in there", "yeah", "gabrielle reece: it's a lot", "[overlapping comments]", "gabrielle reece: well, it's pretty impressive though", "you of course have exhibited - no, no, it's very different", "i would never -  because you've achieved a lot in many different areas", "so how is it different", "gabrielle reece: well, laird says like i'm, you know, stern - i'm a low, steady flame", "laird goes at it at a different degree", "he gets there much quicker", "burns hot for a very long period of time", "gabrielle reece: yeah", "and also just physically that he can express himself with that kind of endurance is different", "a lot of mine is mental", "it's a different - it's just different", "but i really respect that in laird because also he does it when no one is watching, he doesn't tell any - he's not talking about it unless it's to have a conversation about how to approach it, attack it, improve it", "and so it is a very personal quest that he's on for reasons of his own", "like one day we were driving up pch, and there was like literally all these stand-up paddlers out there", "and i can remember clearly when it was laird dragging his one friend out there for seven or eight years before anyone was stand-up paddling", "and i said how does that make you feel", "and he goes, i knew i was having so much fun", "so it was never the idea of like, oh, i'm going to somehow bring this into modern day; it was i'm doing this for myself because i have an idea that i want to express", "and so it's one of the things i appreciate", "or will it bring me fun and enjoyment", "straight up, you know", "well, maybe that's part of the reason you guys are happy, because that's set in high on the list", "you're laughing, laird, but - could you explain to people also because - the foil boarding", "now, this takes my like fear factor to a whole new level because you're basically - well, why don't you explain it for folks", "but it's not like you just jump off the board if things are going sideways, right", "i mean, so what is a foil board?well, it's a surfboard or just a board like a wakeboard with a big strut, like a foil, which is - you know, you see the america's cup guys are using them, and it's a big shaft", "gabrielle reece: it's three feet", "it's over three feet long", "yeah, 48 inches tall", "beneath the board", "beneath the board", "it's like a big fin", "it makes the board fly off the water, but you're attached to it with snowboard boots and bindings, which, you know, you don't swim well with boots", "but it's something that we've kind of came upon as - you know, all of it's about evolution", "you try to ride the biggest surf in the world, and so first we started, you know, with prone guns conventionally and then -  what are prone guns", "like when you lay down on these big guns, and then we knew -  guns is the board", "yeah", "when we say gun, it's designed for giant waves", "it's what all the - you know, the modern, manual way to catch waves", "got it", "and it's an ancient way of doing it", "but you know, we found a cap and we realized there was a ceiling", "and then the -  that's because the bigger waves move faster or -  bigger waves move faster; we're not able to physically keep up", "and that's where the concept of towing came from, the idea of being towed onto one and using the power to match the speed of the wave in order to ride bigger surf", "and when we did that, it made us - allowed us to ride smaller equipment that was actually faster", "right", "and then we could perform on these giant waves.and when you say giant, just for people who may not be familiar with big-wave surfing, what are we talking", "well, i mean, you know, you start - a giant starts at, you know, 50-foot faces, and then it goes above", "so 60, 70, 80-foot faces", "i mean, that's giant", "big surf is - you know, when we say it's big, it's 50 and below", "and then when it goes to giant, and then it goes to like ridiculous or enormous, you know, whatever", "there's big, there's giant, there's enormous", "you know, and then everybody can get into 82.5 feet and all that stuff, but we found a cap, you know, at manual", "we found a cap", "ultimately we found a cap with tow-in", "for tow-in", "and what is the cap", "probably in the range of a hundred feet", "so that's - and we know there's a cap there", "we know that there's an ability - he knows because he's been there", "so we know there's a cap", "and so at that point, and the continual pursuit was how do we get - what are we going to need to do", "and we know that the only way we can do that is to not be on the surface because surface tension is the thing that creates the most drag, which is what is stopping us once the waves are moving at a certain speed", "now, what was the moment or the conversation or the event where it was like, holy shit, like we could do this", "like because the idea of putting the strut, having that foil-like effect on a board, it hadn't occurred previously", "well, no, it actually - you know, i always say every day there's no new idea, just a new application of an old idea", "so this - there's a seated foil called an air chair", "it sat in a garage on maui", "and one summer we were playing around, and my friend goes, oh, this guy's got this weird contraption", "so we went over to the house", "it was in the corner", "it had dust on it, cobwebs", "we were like what's that", "oh, it's some stupid thing called an air chair", "i mean, it wasn't bad enough that he wouldn't let us keep it; but we got it and we rode it and we were in -  now, were you being towed behind something or -  and you're strapped to it", "gabrielle reece: i think murphy created it", "yeah, yeah, and you're strapped to it with a seat, like - and i thought it was for handicapped initially because the position was very - you're strapped with a belt", "wheelchair-like", "yeah", "brian mackenzie: they used to tow people behind boats with them", "yeah", "and now they have a new one - yeah, so now they have the sky ski, where they do flips and people ride these things and do amazing things on them, and you're towed behind a boat, like a water ski boat", "and so we got one, and the first thing we wanted to do was stand on it because we go, listen, again, part of our model is stand up, stand up on the golf port, stand up on stand-up feeling, stand up, like standing up, a better position to be in", "we're humans", "you know, seated is not great, crawling is not wonderful, laying down is even worse", "so we - you know, so we started to stand on", "and as soon as we stood on it, we go, oh, we can stand", "i mean, it was hard because we were using the seat and kind of - and we didn't have bindings", "and so -  that sounds extraordinarily precarious", "very bad", "and it has a big, sharp blade on the bottom of it, so it's not something you don't want to be attached to because if the thing comes around, it's - you know; it could be a bad problem", "so then we just took that, and we asked the guy if it was okay if we - if we played with it, as long as we didn't damage any of it", "he said sure", "so i took the foil out of the board, and i took a wakeboard and we made kind of a makeshift housing so that the foil could fit on there", "and i put snowboard boots on it because we had been doing a lot of snowboarding", "and within, you know, the first day or two, all of a sudden we're standing on this thing and flying", "and as soon as we stood and flew and we knew we could control it, we were like, oh, now we have to go on the waves", "we were like this is going to be for wave riding", "gabrielle reece: you towed behind a ski boat for like almost three years, maybe more", "yeah", "and flat water", "gabrielle reece: like there's practice, lots of practice", "not to mention, weren't you messing around with the hippity hop", "wasn't that the hippity hop, or was that for tow surfing", "no, the hippity hop was for - that was for -  so what is the hippity hop", "gabrielle reece: laird used to go out in front of our house in maui", "it was the hippity hop, and he would try to do spare air", "i am so lost", "what is a hippity hop", "gabrielle reece: what", "when you were a kid", "i have no idea what that is", "[overlapping comments] and like the face of a horse on it or something", "laird used to take those, fold them up really small, and attach it to spare air, which is like basically one shot of air if you're a diver or somebody under", "and in case - he was trying to figure out ways to have water -  what we were looking to do - it was pre-floatation, and we were in giant surf", "we were still kind of searching for floatation because we were worried about -  pre-floatation, you mean like the vests", "gabrielle reece: yeah", "okay, pre-life vest i guess", "yeah, but this is pre us using life vests in giant surf", "now it's everybody uses floatation devices in the giant surf", "gabrielle reece: so let's just say there are a lot of stages between that", "now laird is riding with terry and they're doing in kauai three or four years behind boats and skis", "one broken foot", "because we were in the beginning of the conception of kiting as well, so we -kite boarding", "yeah", "i mean, more or less the modern tow board is what made kite-boarding possible initially, and then the wakeboards came in after", "but we were the first ones to get the french - the non-restartable kites", "the non-restartable, right, right, where you just release the guy and he just flies until he craps and then it was over", "and sometimes you'd be like two miles out to sea with a giant quilt", "have you ever tried to swim with a quilt", "it's very hard", "like a giant quilt, with a quilt and a lunch tray", "literally the board looks like a lunch tray and a quilt, and it's like you're two miles out and you're looking at the shore and you're like this is not a good day for me", "so how does the hippity-hop fit into all this", "gabrielle reece: well, because it's all - i'm just saying it was all part of like simultaneously trying to figure out the equipment and how to ride it and use it, how to be safer and make it possible", "so would he be like on the foil board with the hippity-hop between his legs or - no, at first - no, he's too smart for that", "he'd be with it folded up, and then he'd go out where there's some, you know, white water messing around, and then he'd implode or -  get dropped off and then pull it, and then we started just seeing if it was okay", "so we'd have a pre-inflated -   [overlapping comments] dropped off in front of the giant wave, and then - but we realized that the hippity-hop just hit you in the head, and you'd come up and you'd be face-down and the hippity-hop would be out of the water but you would still be under", "so we - i hopped off the hippity-hop", "brian mackenzie: this goes back to like what she was talking about with the whole incessant like i'm just going to do this, but here's the thing: is i actually know guys who have taken - who have attempted to do the foil boarding, and they just gave up because they're like it's too hard, it's too difficult", "they did not have the patience or the time to want to invest themselves into something, which is like - which is also why a lot of this stuff just works, like with the relationships that they have and even the relationship i have with them, is it is a commitment", "it's a full commitment", "now, why do you think laird sticks to it when these other people don't", "do you think it's - and i won't make it a totally multiple-choice question; these are the options kind of running through my head, right, just having observed how you guys live", "like is it something innate; possible, right", "is it influences that he's had", "is it the peer group that he surrounds himself with or some other factor", "or all", "brian mackenzie: all of the above", "because like i grew up in a very similar fashion where i was very rebellious, where i was told i wasn't going to be able to do things", "i didn't", "i screwed around", "and now it's like you come around full circle to that to where you learn how to get good at something you were good at", "and where he learned early on is what it seems is that, wow, this worked, this happened, i'm making a living off of surfing or whatever that was that - and he's not doing it in a contest", "he's doing it on his own", "like she's grown up in an environment where it wasn't the greatest family environment to where she's thriving and they've created this whole thing where, you know, i was able to do things that i shouldn't - like i was told i wasn't going to do, and i did", "and it was because of the - i was so passionate about what i was doing and i was willing to commit to that and continue to see the results of what that brought, but that became, oh, this is what makes sense, you know, and, i mean, i just wrote something on an instagram post yesterday kind of about this where it's like if you don't have the ability to pay attention enough to your training to understand what rest is, you're now in an ocd-like behavior to where it's like you don't even understand how you're going to get better at something, where it's just paying attention", "and it's like, hey, if i'm paying attention -   [overlapping comments]  but also part of paying attention is being aware of what's happening and seeing it before it's done", "i mean, at the end it's about envisioning it, too, right", "you can see what - you have to be able to see it to continue to pursue it.okay, this is a super important point", "so for yourself, what would be an example of that", "of seeing it and being able to - well, just any one of the things i've been involved with, knowing, like for example, we were able to foil some giant surfs this season", "now, up until then we haven't really ever been - i was in doubt of being able to - even instinctively i knew that this definitely the way to do this, but i didn't - i haven't seen it", "you know, and again, it's that ability to see it before -  envision it, the possibility", "yes, envision it to know it, and then you have all those other things that you need to pursue, but you have to actually be able to see to keep you -  motivated", "brian, i have a question for you because you've worked with so many athletes, and i might want to ask you guys the same question, and that is - and kelly is an expert at this as well", "but what would your advice to be a, say - it doesn't really matter the age, 30, 35, 40, doesn't matter, but a former athlete who's beaten themselves up - may or may not be me - no, it's not me", "but somebody who's really just beating the shit out of themselves who wants to either continue training or get back to the point where they're competing in god knows what, right", "you've observed so many athletes", "what should they do more of", "what should they do less of", "brian mackenzie: more humility", "more humility", "brian mackenzie: that's why i thought it was so important that you come up here", "it wasn't, oh, i need to dose tim with humility; no, it's like, hey, come see what it's like to apply something that you can do for the rest of your life", "yep, yep", "brian mackenzie: if you can't see what you are doing, if you think at 20 that i can just bang away and go as heavy as i want, as hard as i want, as long as i want, and it's not going to have repercussions, you're not looking at it correctly", "and i've been there, i've done it", "and i think this goes to - like this also comes around to i've learned a lot in the fact that i know - like for one, i don't have the only program", "what i'm putting out isn't the only way", "there are a thousand ways", "it's no longer about me being right, and that's a lot with what they're doing", "it's not about being right", "i see the potential of this and yeah, the world now knows standup paddle", "like they now know it, and it's not about i'm right, this was me", "like it's not that", "i think it's where, as an athlete, if you've beaten yourself up to the point to where it's like i've got to deal with this injury or i've got to deal with this stuff, i'm not what i used to be, it's, well, you have a lifetime right now", "what do you want to do", "is it about winning", "is it about being the best at something or is it about how much better can i be tomorrow at what i'm doing today and can i just chip away at a little of that", "and that is what not only i have learned to surround myself with, is people who are doing that, but that's what's these two are doing, that's what kelly's doing, that's what you've done with your career, is you've literally immersed yourself into an environment where you have bred i'm going to meet people who want to be in the long game", "and that's what it's about", "and it really ultimately comes down -  training for life", "brian mackenzie: that's what the truth is", "there's nothing further from that, is this is what the truth is", "i have a bunch of friends that are professional athletes, but one particular one, and we were talking about his training and everything, and i said - i go let me just say what my perspective is when you ask me about training", "train in a way so that when you're done playing, you can go do all the things you want to do", "and i don't mean sit around and drink whiskey and smoke cigars; i mean the things you want to do physically, like all of the things you want to do", "so have a training routine and go about your playing so that when you're done doing that, you can walk maybe", "that would be great", "how about you can run", "how about you can swim", "how about you can bike", "how about you can go water ski, snow ski, or whatever things you want to do because there's obviously some things you're still going to want to do, right", "and so i think that's the focus is like training for life, like training in a way that's sustainable that you can handle.ilike you said, you can't just take the hammering for the next 60 years and then wonder, well, man, i can't even walk", "and even when you do it that way, it's still you have to do all the pieces, too", "you've got to remember that, you know, as an athlete you've got to have - it's the whole picture, it's not just the physical", "it's the eating, it's the sleeping, it's the relationships", "it's all of those things, what you're putting in your brain, what you're putting in your mouth", "i mean, these are all - who you're hanging out with", "all of that stuff is going to feed into the performance", "for instance, one thing i'd never seen before, i've seen people roll out on foam rollers, i've seen people roll out on weird-looking devices that, you know, kelly makes that look like sexual toys", "i've never seen someone roll out on a weight plate before", "well, actually brought that and had the 45 pounds", "and i was like that's funny because i was just - somebody else had just given me the kettle bell", "so the kettle bell was a wicked one until i got the -  so using the handle of the kettle bell on your -  in the gut", "and then kelly one-upped me with a 45-pound platter", "but i didn't have that one by the pool, so we used a ten-pound platter", "just the plate", "yeah", "gabrielle reece: i think another important thing and that brian was saying is that hopefully you hope all of us - and you do this all the time - you're the ultimate student because you always have to adjust and be open", "like this is working but maybe i should change it because it's a moving target, and be open to other people's information and not be threatened by it and give it a try if you're not good at it or whatever", "i think that that's a really important thing because then you can keep growing and evolving", "so for those athletes, i think it's just be open and be a student, but then you have to be disciplined", "you also have to be willing to accept your weaknesses and cultivate those", "it's like it's funny because everybody - the strong people all go lift weights.the flexible people all go do yoga", "and you're like, wait, all you flexible people should go bang some iron and all you big weight-lifters should go do some yoga", "it's like but we always gravitate towards our strengths because we want to be in our glory", "gabrielle reece: i'm not just sore enough and hurt enough that i'm like, okay, i give", "being the student, being the teacher, all that, and also the - and again, the willingness to fail being one of the key elements to all those things is ever present because that means you're willing to subject yourself to, okay, if somebody knows something i don't know, that's failure", "some new thing you haven't done before that you're not going to be good at, like people want to come in and be good at stuff", "that's why the foil board drives half the guys away, because they can't just get on it and rip it the first time", "well, that's just the foil board", "but brian, you were saying that, i mean, obviously a lot of very good athletes come and do the pool workout, and it's like that's a big humility sandwich right there", "brian mackenzie: we brought a rower up here", "rower, like crew rower", "brian mackenzie: yeah", "she rowed my wife in 2005", "gabrielle reece: like the guys gave her it all", "brian mackenzie: yeah", "and we brought her up here and we put her in the pool, and everybody was just like - it was astounding", "brian mackenzie: she had the elements though because she was already a phenomenal swimmer", "super strong", "you know, again, having those key - but it was odd because she has all the physical attributes, but she was very humble", "she wanted to learn", "brian mackenzie: the disposition, because you put might and aggression over there, the water goes, oh, mighty, aggressive, perfect, i'll just drown you", "and normally as males we just implement aggression and power", "so you mentioned weaknesses and strengths, and i wanted to touch on something that you mentioned to me earlier today, which i found very interesting", "when we're doing the ammo box exercise and you talked about isolating limbs and isolating weaknesses, could you elaborate on that a little bit", "and listen, we know that if you work on being more ambidextrous that you get better", "it's like, you know, you throw knives with your right hand and you're really good at it; well, start throwing them with your left hand and it actually makes you better with your right", "but again, about isolation of the weaknesses, is about being realistic about what your flaws are and working on those", "and that's why anything to do with instability, when you talk about balance or in the pool, it really is going to exaggerate those places that normally you can compensate", "because it's hard to compensate in the pool when you have to swim with your left hand if you have a big dumbbell in your right hand because there's no other left hand; there's only the one you have", "and if it doesn't work, you've got to figure out how to make it work, right", "and you can really - and it really shows you, you can really see", "you know, you throw a ball with your left hand if you're right-handed and you feel like, oh, my gosh, whose arm is this, i can't even use this arm, or kick with your left leg or even when you go into stretching and you look at stretching, why is my right hamstring so much looser than my left hamstring, why is my left quad so much tighter than my right quad", "all those things, those are all weaknesses at the end", "and what do you feel like your current weaknesses are that you're working on", "it's ongoing", "i've got a lot of destruction, you know", "i've been beating myself up for a long time, so my weaknesses have more to do with damage", "but like i got some hip flexor, some things going on with my right leg because of the load that i put on it", "why your right leg", "well, it's my back leg in surfing, but it's also because my left leg has been broken seven times", "so that's -", "from surfing or other things", "surfing and other things, but i broke my ankle a bunch of times and arch and a bunch of - all the metatarsals and stuff on the left", "the left ankle and the left foot has taken a lot of the impact", "and so my right has been carrying it, you know, for all these extra years", "so it's got - you know, my right leg has a couple, maybe five or ten more years of use than my left leg", "so i'm dealing with that, and the fact is that we're all asymmetrical", "i mean, even - i told the girls the other day, i go look at the tennis players, i go look at their throwing hand, and they're like, oh, my goodness, the guy's one arm is so much bigger than the other one", "but you don't even see it unless you look for it", "focus on it, yeah", "but, you know, i think that that's a - again, those are the - you know, right now, like i say, it's a hip thing", "you know, it's - i mean, there's always - and it's moving and - but even with that, you're very disciplined", "i've got to say laird is a good patient", "like if he has homework, he does his homework", "if he's told to do stretches, he does his stretches", "so you're always - that's come out of necessity", "that's because i've been hurt so many times", "i mean, you really don't learn anything about yourself ultimately until you've been injured", "back to failure", "whether something failed or you did something that made you crash and get hurt, but at the end - but you also - the thing is, like even brian mentioned earlier, the something that you have that you've discovered is he has the faith that if i do this, then i'll probably be a little better tomorrow", "so they have that faith", "and that, too, laird knows, okay, if i'm not feeling well, if i keep trying different things and i stay open and i do my homework, i can probably be proactive in heling myself get better", "and i think those elements are important because sometimes what happens is sometimes if people aren't feeling well, they're this aged athlete or whatever, they're so far under it, they don't have that faith anymore or they don't understand how to unravel that knot", "and so i think, you know, it's like priming the pump", "sometimes the water doesn't come out right away, but then if you just keep going, it will start to flow", "and i think, you know, certainly in this situation these guys have seen it enough times, and i think that's a really important thing for people to figure out", "well, if you have had the fortune to actually have been through and had success, then it gives you hope", "you know, when this is your one time and you've been perfectly iron man forever and all of a sudden something happens, you're like the whole house breaks and you're in shock and you can't - where if you've been through it and you've recovered once and then you get in and had another thing and you've had enough stuff but you made it back through, you know, it builds the belief that you can do it", "i think another piece of this, and i'd love to ask you about this, brian, is that a lot of athletes surround themselves with people who love to commiserate", "so an athlete will be like, oh, well, you know, i just turned 30; and once you turn 30, like, oh, my god, my aching joints", "i know you guys are both covering your faces, and the reason is, you know, i've - but this is so common and that everyone sits around and bitches and moans, and they use that as an excuse", "gabrielle reece: but it's media and society, too", "but what i love about, you know, hanging out with you guys or like titus, right, there's a photograph", "so titus was in the surfing episode of the tim ferriss experiment, the tv show, and walked into his garage and there's this photo of him surfing a 50-plus-foot wave, and i'm like what is that", "he goes, oh, yeah, it was my 50th birthday", "and i was just like i have no excuses, like shame on me for ever even thinking i have an excuse", "and hanging out with rick, for instance, and then i guess the name - is it don wildman", "was that - could you explain to people - and then, brian, i'd love to ask you, outside of the examples i just gave, sort of who inspires you in that same way", "like one my - my only coach really i'm working with right now is 62, a former four-time world record holder in olympic weight-lifting", "and he can still do what he used to do", "i mean, not necessarily in the same weights, but cold, he can just go out and jump into like [indiscernible] and tennis shoes", "and it's so inspiring to me because whenever i'm like, oh, woe is me, my poor left ankle, i'm like suck it up, ferriss, like give me a break", "so wildman, can you explain - well, don wildman, 82, 80 days of snowboarding last year", "i just went heli snowboarding with him like a month ago or two months ago in alaska", "just, you know, i mean, heli boarding is a rigorous activity, a week straight, you know, 15, 16 runs a day; you know, the third, fourth day, you're wobbling, not a word out of the gunslinger", "but when you meet him, you know, his hunger for information, his youthful enthusiasm, you know, it's like i think that is such a key element when you look at any of these guys", "you see an enthusiasm in them, and i think that's what happens to a lot of athletes", "i think they just lose their enthusiasm", "they're burnt out", "they've been doing their sport since they were 5 or 10 and the pressure around it", "and so i believe ultimately that it's a conscious decision with a physical manifestation", "and so don was never accepting it as being, you know, the guy that hold - he always gives you stuff like the guy that held the olympic record for lifting was 52 or 54 before steroids and blah, blah, blah, and all this stuff, you know, and you see that", "but what's great about somebody like don, who's my guy that i look to, is that just - there it is", "you don't have to imagine what it looks like", "there is it, it's alive, it's well", "i mean, i put don on a bicycle and i can take pretty much almost anybody on a bicycle unless you're like a professional bicyclist, and he will hammer you", "you will be hammered, and you will be asking me how old is the guy up in the front with the gray hair", "82", "and he can still do, what, like 15, 17 pull-ups and then - he's a pull-up machine", "brian mackenzie: amongst other things", "that's a small -  what would you attribute that to", "like why has he not lost his enthusiasm", "and maybe a different way of putting it is for people who are like, god, i would love to have that enthusiasm, but i just don't, like how do i develop that", "what do i do", "like i'm willing to work, like what do i do to have that youthful - well, i mean, i think in his case, he's got a couple driving forces", "he has guilt, and he loves to eat", "so that's one", "like don has a unique thing about that that he can implement, like he wants to eat whatever he wants", "and he loves to eat like cakes and pies and ice cream, and like he'll just devour that stuff", "but at the same time, he wants to be - he's not going to be - he doesn't want any fat on his body", "so for him, he's earning it", "like in his particular case, he's earning it, right", "and also, too, you know, he always says it takes the piss and vinegar out of you", "you know what i mean", "like he knows how it affects his mood and how it makes him feel", "and so once you subject yourself to it for long enough and you're consistent enough, you know, you start to get addicted to that", "you're like food tastes great, my sleeping is great, and my sex is unbelievable", "you know, it's like all this stuff where he just - and then you don't want to lose that", "that's the norm, and then that becomes the driving force", "and then it's easier", "and it's never an option", "you never make it - it's like gabby says, you know, it's not like you don't choose whether you want to brush your teeth or not", "you don't go, oh, i'm not going to brush my teeth this week, you know, i don't need to do that", "it's just something -  well, the other thing don does that's very genius, it goes back to what brian said, which is he solicits people to be in his group because no man can really do it alone", "so he always has these guys around him, most of them quite a bit younger", "so the energy goes into the pot, and everybody rolls", "brian mackenzie: or girls, yeah", "gabrielle reece: well, yeah, one girl", "brian mackenzie: but he loves to be a host and bring people with him and do things", "gabrielle reece: he'll give you the bike; he'll get your music set up for you", "he'll do everything for you", "brian mackenzie: erin and i do that", "it's like we invite - i'm picking up a girl this afternoon at lax who's going to be staying with us for a week to train, participate, and it's like -  thank you for your 80 units of energy contribution to the pot", "brian mackenzie: now we're going to absorb that", "it also confirms that you're - it's like a reminder, you know, because, again, it's like gabby would say with the stand-up paddlers", "at the end when you go through what you went through today and i see your face and i know what it did to you and i know later you'll be like sitting somewhere and you'll want to go to sleep, i'll be like, hey, just give me the call", "call me because it's confirmation that you're - when you're alone in something, a lonely place is an unmotivated place.that's a great way to put it", "brian mackenzie: it's very unique to find a complete loner that has full maximum motivation, really motivated", "we are communal", "we are communal, but that's why we're subjected to all of this peer pressure, too", "we're subjected to social pressure of, hey, now you're 30, you're over the hill, what are you going to do now", "you know what i mean", "but that's social stuff that we implement", "but the reverse of that is, hey, we're all together and you're 60, you're 70, i'm 50, he's 30, we're all going, let's go", "i was talking to my trainer's wife, who's awesome, and she also has a couple of world records", "and super sweetheart", "and she's i guess 55, around there, and she was - she said to me, she's like you know when people start to get old, and she said it's when they stop jumping, when they stop jumping", "we can talk about whether that's right or wrong, but the follow-up was even more interesting to me because she has a daughter, a young daughter, and there was something stuck up in a tree", "and she got up into the tree, and her daughter was like, mom, be careful, it's really high", "and she climbed up 20, 25 feet, got the thing out, and climbed back down", "she was like do you know what it says to a daughter to see her mom who's 55 effortlessly like go up into a tree, get it, and come down", "like it just shows her possibilities that - sometimes like your kids see you train like we train", "they may be like, well, maybe i don't want to train", "maybe i don't want to climb trees, mom's crazy", "brian, who else sort of inspires you, people you look up to as, say, a don wildman type", "it doesn't have to be someone older than you, but like who are the people you look to as inspiration when maybe you're feeling overwhelmed or burned out or we'll fill in the blank", "brian mackenzie: i do a decent amount of reading and a decent amount of watching of documentaries and a decent amount of being voyeuristic with people who are creative, regardless of that creativity", "a lot of it has to do with food sometimes", "you look at what they're doing", "like 20 years ago, maybe a little longer, chefs were not looked at as anything; they were just in the back cooking", "now if you pay enough attention, they are these masterful creators of things", "you know, one of the best documentaries i've ever seen is a movie called spinning plates", "it's a must-see if you're really looking to progress yourself because there's a guy by the name of - his name is grant and he runs one of the top seven restaurants in the world, and he has this way of dealing with food, much like you see a lot of great chefs at this point", "what country is he in", "brian mackenzie: he's in the united states", "is his name grant atkins", "brian mackenzie: yes, yes, grant atkins", "so he's got alinea, so they're following alinea; but they're also following a homestead in like iowa that's just this family-run place that the entire community goes to, and then they're following this mexican place in tucson, which is barely making it", "and they play the entire show, and you're watching this movie or this documentary on all of these places and as they're progressing in their trials, their tribulations, and all this stuff", "and at the end, grant has seen the entire thing, and you think he's this like demigod of food, and he explains what he does", "and he goes, you know, what i'm doing is if somebody can come to my restaurant and they feel that they taste the food and they feel it and they come to ask in the back, because they can talk to the chef, and they say, hey, i feel like i know you", "and he goes that's exactly what i want to do", "in essence, that's what i do, is it's like i want people to see how i see the world", "don't take everything i do, but let it inspire you to some degree", "but he literally goes at the end of this thing, the mexican restaurant is doing the exact same thing, and it failed at that point in the movie", "literally they went bankrupt and they didn't make it and, you know, it didn't last", "and he's like but nobody understood that because they think because it's not flashy and it's this thing that they're not getting that experience, yet it was that experience", "and that homestead, that's the exact same thing i'm doing", "they're just expressing themselves in another way through this, and we're not taking the time to understand that", "and i think that's where one of the missing links is with a lot of people, is we want this great, huge, massive inspiration, but the fact is every bit of inspiration you need or want is in front of you and anything you want if you're willing to go the length to be obsessive enough about it", "and i think that it's not just food with me", "it's like i just watched some coach do something the other day who i remember this kid like seven years ago at my buddy's gym, and he was just this little kid who was just learning and wanting to understand", "he's doing things right now from a gymnastics perspective that he's showing people through social media of him doing things and how he sees the world that is just amazing, and i'm like i get so much out of that", "and i'm like i'm going to go and do some stuff that's like inspiring me to do that", "and it's what you choose to get out of it i think", "what's his name", "brian mackenzie: his name is colin paraday", "cool, i'll check it out", "i think it's so true", "i mean, like you were saying, laird, no new ideas, just sort of old concepts and ideas apply to new areas, it's like you don't have to look in fitness to find inspiration to be better in fitness; you can look at someone like grant", "grant's amazing", "yeah, i mean, he cooked for i think it was a period of one or two years with no taste because he had tongue cancer", "who was it", "beethoven i think who composed without being able to hear", "just insane", "so i want to be really - this is so much fun, but i want to be respectful of your time", "so i'll just ask one or two more questions", "so why don't we start with - and i'll ask the same question of all three of you", "but gabby, what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self", "gabrielle reece: well, i always say i would have - and i mentioned this earlier, but certainly not to take anything personal but also maybe don't hold yourself back", "i think sometimes - and i think this is a trait of a female more than of a male", "we have a tendency sometimes to sit on our talents and potentials because we don't want to offend anyone or we don't want to be singled out, you know", "i heard a great story, i had a coach once that said - he was an assistant coach to the men's usa volleyball team", "and this game, it was one point, and the coach looked straight at [indiscernible] and said i need you to put this ball away and you to win this game, and it was like, boom, okay", "and he said it was amazing, and then he did it", "and then he had his opportunity; he was coaching a bunch of women at a very high level", "and he did the same thing to the athlete that was the one", "and everyone, it didn't work because all the other - it was a singling out that women - we have a hard time with, instead of understanding that you can be singled out but still for the greater good", "so i think i would have maybe not tried to - i think i sat on some of my talents a little bit and also i think i certainly, like i said, i took things personally", "so i would tell that person like don't take it personally", "i tell my kids learn how to say, i'm sorry, that doesn't work for me", "again, i've learned a lot from being around men", "i respect a lot of traits", "you can deliver a message without emotion", "usually women, in order to finally stand up for themselves, they have to be kind of ramped up, and then it just comes out ballistic, instead of, no, that doesn't work for me", "and then we don't - and also not to then second guess that after you've laid that line down", "i think that that's really important", "and i think, you know, it's important to, if you have gifts and talents, whatever they are, don't feel guilty and bad or weird about it", "you know, you don't have to be a schmuck", "i mean, you don't have to - i always tell kids if you're on the team, you're lucky; and if you're the best one, you're the luckiest", "so it's calibrating all of that", "i think i would have done that", "you know, we always say we're grateful for it because it gets you where you are", "grateful for", "gabrielle reece: for whatever things you had to go through that you did or didn't do", "the notion of regret is - it's not that it's pointless, but, you know, it's sort of like that gets you to where you are", "yeah", "good advice", "good advice for anybody", "laird, what advice would you give your 30-year-old self", "stop drinking now", "stop drinking right now and patent all your ideas", "good advice", "they go together well, too", "that was good advice", "brian, what about you", "brian mackenzie: i think be patient, be more patient", "and what if your 30-year-old self is like, fuck that, why should i be patient", "brian mackenzie: well, that's why", "yeah, you don't understand just be patient", "you know, i think i was in a big rush at 30", "you know, i'm 40 now, and so it's like that decade has gone by and it's like, you know, i am so - i mean, i'm like, wow, like being patient - like i am so much more patient now, and there's much more work to be done", "but it's like it's just - when it's piecemeal and it's this just - okay, it makes so much more sense when you're putting stuff together", "what has helped you most to become more patient", "brian mackenzie: honestly, the experience and the relationships that i have", "the relationships that i used to have versus what i have now, like it's not even better inputs, they're just real people", "this is really real", "i have a wife that is just amazing that understands me and on a level that it's like, hey, you need to do your thing, you know, i support it", "let go", "like i get it", "like i have crazy behavior, like, you know, i get fixated on things that i'm doing, and it's like she - she may not get it, but she gets it", "and that's so hard to come by when you're 30", "i didn't know - i didn't date girls", "that was my problem, you know, maybe that it was like i wasn't patient enough to date girls when i was 30 or to be involved with them at 30 that understood stuff like that", "you know, to be involved with people and women like that is truly a blessing, so patience is definitely a big one at 30", "gabrielle reece: what about you", "i would have told myself to start meditating; it's not just for hippies", "start sitting down", "rick is actually - rick urban is one of the - he and another friend - i was just going through a very anxious, rushed like aggressive period where i had a short fuse and was just, you know, rushed to get everything done", "and spoke with two close friends", "one is chase jarvis, world-class photographer, amazing guy, and he was like, you know, maybe you should try tm or other types of meditation", "and then i was like, 1500 bucks to get a mantra, no, thanks; that sounds like a cult", "and then i had coffee with rick, and he was like have you ever thought about tm", "and i'm like, goddamn it, this tm, all right, fine", "but just i would have said there are many - i worry with these hypotheticals of screwing up, like causing an unintended butterfly effect in the past, so i'm like i wouldn't have changed anything, i'm not sure i want to change anything, but the - it's hard for me to see how taking 20 minutes first thing in the morning to meditate would have produced any bad results for me", "that goes back to patience", "gabrielle reece: in the book that laird talks about, natural born heroes, if you're hunched forward - well, first of all, if you're hunched forward, you go into fight or flight, right", "you have a physiological response", "and now that we're all on our gadgets, we're all perpetually in this position, so it creates anxiety", "brian mackenzie: we're looking around", "so we're in this position and then we're - we have an instinctual thing to know what's going on around us, and we don't while we're doing it", "and that just grinds on us", "gabrielle reece: so i think we're actually putting ourselves unknowingly in positions physically that are also creating an emotional response, one of them being anxiety and angst because we're not living fully or closer to our natural the way it should be", "totally agree", "i've been trying to take time every day at the very least, even if i'm doing a lot of writing, because i also think we're going to find a lot of visual problems with people who are only focusing between 8 and 12 inches all day long", "so i try to focus on things in the distance and really take in -  like solar gazing", "that will be - you could work on that", "that would really help your vision", "you talk about meditation, wim, you do that program, because his whole thing is about meditation", "i mean, at the end, it's all these drills, but it's ultimately about meditation", "it's a mechanical meditation", "it's not this - it's not a swammy kind of ethereal thing where you're trying to grab something in space", "this is mathematical", "brian mackenzie: and he's the first one to say i don't have the answer and this guy is going to be better at it than me and it's okay", "gabrielle reece: he'll say we don't have to get there today, we're going to do the best we can", "i'm like, okay", "i'll have to check him out", "so if you guys could make - this will be a last question before i just ask where people can find everything you all are up to", "brian, if you could make one ask of the people listening or one recommendation, what would it be", "brian mackenzie: honestly, it's like what you asked in the sauna", "it's like what's tickling your fancy", "and it's the breathing, being more aware of your breathing because, quite honestly, it's exactly what gabby just brought up and we were just talking about, is when you're - you can't breathe correctly when you're here, when you're collapsed", "it's all about a position, and that's basically more or less what kelly and i have really worked our careers at, is it's about position and the way you move is i understand what you're saying, like i see what's going on inside", "you know, you can't lie to me at this point", "so i think for me ultimately it's about breathing, and honestly that's - i would never have arrived at the meditation thing had it not been for the breathing and it being like this is fun", "like i'm having a blast seeing what i get out of this and how i feel after doing this and going through this stuff", "i think if people really were willing to figure - see that stuff, you know, to take the time to do that, it takes a couple weeks and then you're like, wow, this is really something like i have not thought about, regardless of what the breathing is", "where would you suggest someone start with that", "brian mackenzie: i honestly think people should start with wim hoff", "his method, google it", "it's a cheap course for ten weeks", "of course, you know, we're tweaking and playing with other things and that's what we do, but i honestly think the guy - and we'll probably get him out here at some point", "the fact is, is it's like i don't care if you're a cross-fitter, if you're a professional athlete in some other sport; if you don't breathe right, you've got a fault going on", "you've got something going on, and you can expand upon it and you can understand much more", "you know, like i said with the eckert thing, eckert's thing is the breath because the breath is now", "there's nothing after", "you're not thinking about the past, you're not thinking about the future, you're focused on what's happening right now", "and the breath and the spirit are as one because when the baby is slapped on the butt and take its first breath, i'm just saying that when the breath leaves, the spirit leaves", "brian mackenzie: that's the breath, is the spirit", "so gabby, what would your ask or recommendation be", "gabrielle reece: well, i ask that everyone - you know, i always say that we only appreciate our health when we don't have it", "and i think, you know, through injuries and things i've learned to appreciate my health", "but i think, you know, sort of besides your friends and family that the most important thing to covet and take care of is yourself", "it's just to the best of their ability", "like if you're not walking today, go walk", "if you're still smoking, you know, smoke less", "like it's not about get it all done all at once, but just finding a way to make that a real priority", "and then my ask would be - i always say that i'll go first", "and so that means if i'm checking out at the store, i'll say hello first", "if i'm coming across somebody and make eye contact, i'll smile first", "if people would experiment with that in their life a little bit, be first, because - not all times, but most times it comes in your favor", "but then the response is pretty amazing", "like you'll see somebody", "i was at the park the other day with the kids", "oh, my god", "hurricane harbor, it's like hell", "and there were these two women a little bit older than me", "we couldn't be more different, right", "and i walked by them and i just looked at them and smiled", "the smile came to their face so instantly, they're ready; but you have to go first because now we're being trained in this world, nobody's going first anymore", "so for me it's like take care of yourself because that also helps you go first sooner if you feel pretty good, and go first", "laird", "well, they went first", "they did steal some good material", "and i think part of - of course, the breath is - that's our food and that's what we get when we don't eat and that's our - the breath of life", "and, you know, in going first and cherishing the temple, you know, i think what gabby said about going first leads to what i think, too", "and again, quoting my latest favorite book natural born heroes, that the compassion, that i think compassion is - exercise compassion every day", "if you could actually go out and just exercise some form of compassion, no matter what it be, i think that's some powerful stuff", "i think it would be a different world if people went and were compassionate", "i have to remind myself", "that's an ask but that's also a do for me", "i'm asking myself to do it", "and again, i use that as, you know, what's good for the goose is good for the gander, which is, you know, ask what you want of yourself, and then i think it's probably - you know, it's like i like stand-up, i like foiling, i like this, you know, i like the breathing", "other people will like it, too, you know", "mine is - i think i'm going with the compassion", "it seems like going first is a good small step in that direction", "gabrielle reece: and i think the most important thing from all of us would be don't do it - it's about each person doing it their way, that discovery, not laird's way or brian's way or gabby's way or tim's way", "it's about does any of the conversation spark you to motivate you to find your way because that is the right way for you", "i don't believe that any of us believe in saying this is the way", "i mean, certainly breathing, it's hard to get around it", "but ultimately when do you do it", "how do you want to do it, whatever that is", "how do you want to eat, whatever", "outside, inside exercise", "but it's really more about you've got to put energy into finding your way", "his is physical, hers is emotional, compassion, but - and then just drinking more liquids, hydration", "drink more water", "brian mackenzie: it's like be an experiment", "we've gotten so far away from that, and i think this is where science has really led us because science has really gotten far off", "in fact, everybody in science is trying to prove themselves right", "that's not what science is", "science is not about proving yourself right; science is about learning something new", "and that is - if you aren't willing to experiment and learn it your way, that's how it's going to make sense", "don't just try wim's way", "i'm like seven different breathing techniques in at this point, which is just, you know, radical", "but it's like that's where it's led to", "and laird has done it as well, and that's the thing", "be an experiment so that you understand what works and what doesn't", "and also, i mean, what's really inspired me hanging out with all of you guys is that another way of looking at experimentation is playing", "like you guys have an element of play that i think many people lose as soon as they graduate from high school or college", "gabrielle reece: i appreciate that", "sometimes we have a tendency as we get older to make our play become more of a destructive process", "and it's like what i said about wildman and i said about every single guy, and i guarantee you your trainer has retained his youthful enthusiasm", "definitely", "they both play all the time", "exactly", "if the mom is climbing trees, then i guarantee you that - and it's about retention of your youthful enthusiasm, that that's really what it's about, right, having fun and that spirit of that child is what will lead you to be an older child", "you'll be older young, but you'll be young", "you'll be young.this is great", "i want to close with just asking each of you where we can learn more about what you're up to, your work and so on", "so brian", "brian mackenzie: i think the easiest way to get a hold of me is through -
