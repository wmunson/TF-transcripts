[Speaking foreign language.] Long time no see, literally in Mandarin, or [speaking foreign language] in Japanese. This is Tim Ferriss. I\u2019m feeling a little lightheaded and a little frisky today. This episode is not going to be me deconstructing a world-class performer, as I usually do in interview format over two to three hours. This is not that. This is going to be very short, hopefully very, very actionable and practical. I was asked recently how I choose my projects and what I say yes to, what I say no to. I riffed on this and we recorded it as part of something larger that I\u2019ll be sharing in the near future. I realized that the real question is, at the root of a lot of my decisions, how can I waste money to improve my quality of life? And this seems like a bad thing, but it is not. It is trading pennies for dollars. So how can you waste money to improve the quality of your life? Well, I will delve into all of that and much more. This was spontaneous. It\u2019s off the cuff, so it is not a TED Talk, but I hope you will get a lot out of it. I was encouraged to share it because people there at the time felt like folks might like it. So please enjoy how to waste money to improve quality of life. How do I determine what to delegate versus what to do on my own?  This is an ongoing challenge, as it is for a lot of people, but a few of the things that I consider are: first and foremost, do I understand the task and the roles and the actions, to-do lists, checklists involved? This is going to sound funny and I don\u2019t think this is necessarily the best approach for everyone, but for me as a Type-A perfectionist, I like to have a base level of competency in almost anything that I delegate. I say almost anything because I\u2019m not a coder, for instance, so I don\u2019t need to know how to work with CSS or anything else to work with a designer, but I do know how to sketch and create mock-ups or wire frames. So I can work with those abstraction layers and then the levels below it \u2013 the sort of implementation of that, I don\u2019t need to understand as well. But in case of, for instance, podcast editing, I went into a very imperfect tool \u2013 GarageBand, in this case \u2013 and edited the first probably 20 or 30 episodes, because I enjoyed learning that, as I enjoy learning new skills. But ultimately once I understood how to refine the process, then I delegate it. So to frame that another way, I think it was Bill Gates who said, and I\u2019m paraphrasing, but this was in The 4-Hour Workweek, that when you add people to an inefficient process, you make things worse. Only when you add people to an efficient process do you make things better. And there\u2019s a book called The Mythical Man-Month on software design and software development that talks about this. Where if you have a late software project because the underlying process has been fucked, if you add more developers to it, you\u2019re just going to make things worse. It\u2019s just going to take longer. So I like to test drive almost every process myself first, before I delegate it. I think that most problems with delegation, most things that get missed, most mistakes that get made are the boss\u2019s fault, not the employee\u2019s fault or the contractor\u2019s fault. It\u2019s because the task itself wasn\u2019t clear enough in the beginning. A lot of people delegate because they don\u2019t want to do the hard thinking. You have to do the hard thinking. You should delegate because you can give hard work to someone else or time consuming work. So that\u2019s No. 1. I like to have a base level of competency of all these things. Then how do I choose what to delegate?  I will look at my highest yield activities. The way I\u2019ll determine that is I will look at, for instance, my to-do list, which is really a list of tasks or next actions of some type. I will ask myself, which one of these if done will make all of the rest easier to do or irrelevant? Because I\u2019m looking for \u2013 and I\u2019ve used this analogy before \u2013 the lead domino. I\u2019m looking for the first domino. I don\u2019t want to knock down 7,000 different dominoes that are downstream and have to repeat that process. I want to find the one Archimedes lever that, when used effectively, makes everything else either easier to do or irrelevant. That is what I will focus on, generally speaking. When in doubt, the thing that you\u2019ve been avoiding the longest is the thing that you should at least do the hard thinking on first. So what is important? How do I know what my most important task is to do? Before I check email in the two hours that I\u2019ve blocked out for that type of deep work, whatever it is that makes you most uncomfortable. But I will look at this list and very often, my highest yield activity will be related to one of my more unique abilities. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s unique. Singular to me \u2013 for instance, part of the reason that I took \u2013 and this is not delegation, this is elimination, so we\u2019re getting very 4-Hour Workweek here, but you have definition, elimination, automation, liberation. Okay, so before I liberate myself by delegating, I want to remove as much as possible. So at one point about a year ago now, I realized that I was replaceable as an investor in the startup ecosystem. Economics were such that given deal structures and absurd things that were happening and an oversupply of capital, if I was approached by an entrepreneur who is just price shopping for valuation, for instance, and I said no, I would just head out of the line and there\u2019d be 20 behind me to take the deal. One of my friends said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop writing.\u201d He said to me, \u201cYou are replaceable as an investor, but I\u2019ve seen you at conferences where people come up to you and they\u2019re crying because they lost 100 pounds and it changed their life or saved their marriage or whatever it might be. You\u2019re not going to have that impact; you\u2019re not going to see that impact, at least, as an investor.\u201d Therefore, I try to focus on my unique or more unique abilities as much as possible. Things that I don\u2019t think I can delegate. Ideally, I have a Venn diagram of the things that I am uniquely capable of doing well, or somewhat uniquely capable of doing well, the things that I enjoy doing (that\u2019s the second circle), and then the things that give me a high yield. And that could be a yield of capital financially speaking. It could give me a high yield of time. For instance, if I invest ten hours now in creating a system making decisions about X, for instance, not to do startup investing at all, which is what I decided, because I don\u2019t do moderation well. You can search \u201cstartup vacation\u201d and \u201cTim Ferriss\u201d for a long description of how I did this. I sat down, I did journaling, and came to the conclusion by looking at worst case scenarios \u2013 what is the worst that could happen if \u2013 how could I get back to this point if I wanted to reverse it, etc.? I decided to do no startup investing. So I did the hard thinking that eliminated a thousand smaller decisions moving forward. Now I just archive any cold pitch that I get. Any cold intro that I get from, say a venture capitalist to an entrepreneur gets an auto responder that says, \u201cI am not doing startup investing. Here is the article if you want to read it.\u201d That is, I think, where people should focus before delegating is eliminating as much as possible. Other things that I think about would be largely questions that I ask. So one of the temptations as an entrepreneur is to look at a task you delegate and say to yourself this is a fallacy. The internal dialogue will be something along the lines of: I could delegate this but it\u2019s going to take me just as long to describe it as it will to just do it myself. So I\u2019ll just do it myself. And here\u2019s the miscalculation: The assumption is time is the currency that you are protecting in this case. So time is the most valuable currency. I would say that time, as much as I talk about it, is only valuable to the extent that you have attention and present state awareness. So for instance, if I have a three-hour block set aside for deep work on writing. And there\u2019s a great essay, I think it\u2019s called \u201cMaker\u2019s Schedule, Manager\u2019s Schedule\u201d by Paul Graham. A fantastic read. Everyone should read it. But in effect, for me to write really effectively (and this is true for a lot of coders also, and musicians, if they\u2019re composing), I need a lot of time set aside. Because there\u2019s a very long warm-up process and to synthesize takes space mentally and otherwise. Yes, I could have time in the middle of that to handle sending, for instance, wire instructions to my bank to get something done instead of having my assistant do it.\u00a0It might be faster for me to do it. I could do it in 30 seconds. It\u2019s going to take me this much time to do blah, blah, blah. But the question is, can I afford the distraction? Even if I have to upset someone, postpone it, talk to them the next day, get it done, pay a late fee, whatever it might be. The question isn\u2019t do I have the time. It\u2019s also, can I afford the distraction? Because if in the middle of that three hours I get a text from my assistant like, I really need help doing this. Can you please do Y? Or whatever it might be. I don\u2019t why I start with Y instead of X. Just to throw you off. And if I address that \u2013 ideally I don\u2019t even see the text, which is why I put my phone on airplane \u2013 but let\u2019s just say I see it. If I address that and I take five to ten minutes to do it, the three-hour clock starts over. So maybe I get only 20 minutes of real good writing in that period, as opposed to an hour and a half. Was that worth the interruption, even though I saved five minutes in the implementation? No. It was a complete loss. It was a total Faustian bargain. So the book that I would recommend and I\u2019ve said this before to at least a handful of people, my favorite book on productivity is called The Effective Executive. A terribly bland title by Peter Drucker, The Effective Executive. The 4-Hour Workweek, I\u2019m just sort of assuming that people listening to this have probably already read that. But The Effective Executive is fantastic because it focuses on being effective \u2013 doing the right things, not just doing things well \u2013 being efficient. Because you can be really good at doing things that don\u2019t matter. The effectiveness part \u2013 so in a way, I\u2019m not dodging the question, but I think that the vast majority of people I talk to when they say, oh my God, I\u2019m overwhelmed by X, Y and Z. I need to hire people A, B and C to handle it. Those tasks largely shouldn\u2019t be done in the first place. When I drill down and we have two glasses of wine and talk about their systems and so on, they haven\u2019t done the deep dive to really determine the relative value of all of these things. They\u2019re just feeling temporarily overwhelmed and they just want to hit the volleyball back over the net and not think about it for a while. So that would be where I would start. The last piece I\u2019ll throw out there, and I know this is a meandering answer, is that I\u2019ve been asking myself more and more, how can I waste money (in air quotes), how can I waste money to improve my quality of life? And pick a crazy number.  So if you currently spend \u2013 and this is not prudent to do if you are just scraping by and paying for your rent; this is not a place for what I\u2019m going to suggest. But let\u2019s just say you\u2019ve hit a level up in your career and you have a little bit of disposal income.\u00a0Your behaviors may be tethered to a very frugal lifestyle that you once had, where your money was a scarcer resource that your time. So for me, I came out of college, my family never made much money, very, very frugal by necessity. Then I get to college, worked as a bouncer. I worked in the library and then I figured out some other options that made a bit more money; illustration, etc. Graduate, I\u2019m making $40,000.00 or so a year in Silicon Valley at the peak of \u201999. Prices are insane.\u00a0And I found myself, even a few years ago, realizing, for instance, that I was blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars of opportunity by flying economy internationally when I needed to sleep. So this might sound funny, but I\u2019ve had the budget to buy business class tickets for a very long time now, but it wasn\u2019t until about five years ago, after I went to a speaking engagement in Australia.\u00a0I flew economy because I was like what? I\u2019m not going to spend an extra $2,000.00 on a business class ticket. I couldn\u2019t sleep at all and was just a complete disaster for a speaking engagement that could\u2019ve easily led to many, many future engagements. I did a good job of that. It required a ton of caffeine. It required all-nighters and my health suffered for about a week. So it\u2019s like okay, was the $2,000.00 worth sacrificing my health for a week and being at half capacity? No, easily not; at all. The value of my time being at 10 out of 10 is far more valuable. Second, was it worth the potential opportunity cost of the people in the audience who could\u2019ve hired me for very high-paying gigs? No; not at all. So I\u2019ve modified my older behaviors that were survival behaviors to be more abundance mindset behaviors. I can always make more money. I can\u2019t create more time. At this point, I can\u2019t necessarily fix my health if I ruin it. So the question that I ask now is okay, my old self would view buying a business class ticket as a waste of money. What other ways can I \u201cwaste\u201d money to improve my quality of life? Maybe that\u2019s hiring someone to clean. Maybe that\u2019s taking Uber instead of having a car to deal with for maintenance and insurance and parking and parking tickets and all of that bullshit. Maybe it\u2019s who knows? Fill in the blank. So I will do journaling exercises where I\u2019ll write down, okay pick a number. Let\u2019s just say \u2013 I\u2019m making this up \u2013 you have $5,000.00 of disposable income per month, all right? I\u2019m putting aside how much you need to save for whatever you want to save for. So if you have college tuition to save for and so on, you need to do those calculations on your own. But let\u2019s just say you have $5,000.00 you can do whatever you want with and you\u2019re currently only spending $500.00.\u00a0You have all these things that are driving you crazy. Well, let\u2019s say I wanted to go crazy and spend $2,000.00 per month. You want to \u201cwaste\u201d (so-called waste) $2,000.00 a month to improve your quality of life. What would that look like? What are some crazy things that you could do? Just journal. Start making a list. Start writing it out. Don\u2019t edit. It\u2019s incredible what you will come up with. You can then test it on a trial basis for a week or two. That is how I\u2019ve identified some of the smallest changes with the largest quality of life outputs imaginable by doing this very simple exercise. I hate to give so many caveats, but this does not mean that you take your whole life savings and blow it on whisky and whores, okay? Just so we\u2019re clear. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m recommending. It does mean, however, that you don\u2019t, when you\u2019ve reached a certain level in Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs, that you don\u2019t make decisions based on a survival mindset that has traveled with you from the sort of shelter/food basis, if that makes sense. It\u2019s taken me a long time to realize that. This type of questioning and these types of journaling exercises and overall a focus on effectiveness and not efficiency, I think, are the drivers behind \u2013 long story long \u2013 how I decide what to do myself or what to delegate.

handful of people, my favorite book on productivity is called the effective executive", "a terribly bland title by peter drucker, the effective executive", "the 4-hour workweek, i\u2019m just sort of assuming that people listening to this have probably already read that", "but the effective executive is fantastic because it focuses on being effective \u2013 doing the right things, not just doing things well \u2013 being efficient", "because you can be really good at doing things that don\u2019t matter", "the effectiveness part \u2013 so in a way, i\u2019m not dodging the question, but i think that the vast majority of people i talk to when they say, oh my god, i\u2019m overwhelmed by x, y and z", "i need to hire people a, b and c to handle it", "those tasks largely shouldn\u2019t be done in the first place", "when i drill down and we have two glasses of wine and talk about their systems and so on, they haven\u2019t done the deep dive to really determine the relative value of all of these things", "they\u2019re just feeling temporarily overwhelmed and they just want to hit the volleyball back over the net and not think about it for a while", "so that would be where i would start", "the last piece i\u2019ll throw out there, and i know this is a meandering answer, is that i\u2019ve been asking myself more and more, how can i waste money (in air quotes), how can i waste money to improve my quality of life", "and pick a crazy number", " so if you currently spend \u2013 and this is not prudent to do if you are just scraping by and paying for your rent; this is not a place for what i\u2019m going to suggest", "but let\u2019s just say you\u2019ve hit a level up in your career and you have a little bit of disposal income.\u00a0your behaviors may be tethered to a very frugal lifestyle that you once had, where your money was a scarcer resource that your time", "so for me, i came out of college, my family never made much money, very, very frugal by necessity", "then i get to college, worked as a bouncer", "i worked in the library and then i figured out some other options that made a bit more money; illustration, etc", "graduate, i\u2019m making $40,000.00 or so a year in silicon valley at the peak of \u201999", "prices are insane.\u00a0and i found myself, even a few years ago, realizing, for instance, that i was blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars of opportunity by flying economy internationally when i needed to sleep", "so this might sound funny, but i\u2019ve had the budget to buy business class tickets for a very long time now, but it wasn\u2019t until about five years ago, after i went to a speaking engagement in australia.\u00a0i flew economy because i was like what", "i\u2019m not going to spend an extra $2,000.00 on a business class ticket", "i couldn\u2019t sleep at all and was just a complete disaster for a speaking engagement that could\u2019ve easily led to many, many future engagements", "i did a good job of that", "it required a ton of caffeine", "it required all-nighters and my health suffered for about a week", "so it\u2019s like okay, was the $2,000.00 worth sacrificing my health for a week and being at half capacity", "no, easily not; at all", "the value of my time being at 10 out of 10 is far more valuable", "second, was it worth the potential opportunity cost of the people in the audience who could\u2019ve hired me for very high-paying gigs", "no; not at all", "so i\u2019ve modified my older behaviors that were survival behaviors to be more abundance mindset behaviors", "i can always make more money", "i can\u2019t create more time", "at this point, i can\u2019t necessarily fix my health if i ruin it", "so the question that i ask now is okay, my old self would view buying a business class ticket as a waste of money", "what other ways can i \u201cwaste\u201d money to improve my quality of life", "maybe that\u2019s hiring someone to clean", "maybe that\u2019s taking uber instead of having a car to deal with for maintenance and insurance and parking and parking tickets and all of that bullshit", "maybe it\u2019s who knows", "fill in the blank", "so i will do journaling exercises where i\u2019ll write down, okay pick a number", "let\u2019s just say \u2013 i\u2019m making this up \u2013 you have $5,000.00 of disposable income per month, all right", "i\u2019m putting aside how much you need to save for whatever you want to save for", "so if you have college tuition to save for and so on, you need to do those calculations on your own", "but let\u2019s just say you have $5,000.00 you can do whatever you want with and you\u2019re currently only spending $500.00.\u00a0you have all these things that are driving you crazy", "well, let\u2019s say i wanted to go crazy and spend $2,000.00 per month", "you want to \u201cwaste\u201d (so-called waste) $2,000.00 a month to improve your quality of life", "what would that look like", "what are some crazy things that you could do", "just journal", "start making a list", "start writing it out", "don\u2019t edit", "it\u2019s incredible what you will come up with", "you can then test it on a trial basis for a week or two", "that is how i\u2019ve identified some of the smallest changes with the largest quality of life outputs imaginable by doing this very simple exercise", "i hate to give so many caveats, but this does not mean that you take your whole life savings and blow it on whisky and whores, okay", "just so we\u2019re clear", "that\u2019s not what i\u2019m recommending", "it does mean, however, that you don\u2019t, when you\u2019ve reached a certain level in maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, that you don\u2019t make decisions based on a survival mindset that has traveled with you from the sort of shelter/food basis, if that makes sense", "it\u2019s taken me a long time to realize that", "this type of questioning and these types of journaling exercises and overall a focus on effectiveness and not efficiency, i think, are the drivers behind \u2013 long story long \u2013 how i decide what to do myself or what to delegate"]}
