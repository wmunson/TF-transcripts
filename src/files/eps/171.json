germs, this is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers, whether they are from the worlds of athletics, business, strategy of any type of fashion, entertainment, or otherwise. This episode is a little bit different. It is not going to be a long form interview where I dissect or deconstruct a world, class performer \u2013 or at least not in the usual fashion. Instead, this is a special edition of The Random Show. I am joined by my usual cohost in this capacity, Kevin Rose \u2013 @kevinrose on Twitter. He\u2019s a serial entrepreneur and world class investor, and that is not an exaggeration. He is one of the best product guys for those in Silicon Valley or technology investors I know. What makes him unique is perhaps and unusual combination. He\u2019s very good at very early stage investing \u2013 seed investing \u2013 and at the public markets. He\u2019s also an all-around wild and crazy guy, which makes for a fun conversation. So we go all over the place. We talk about new and favorite books, memory training, multiple wives \u2013 or maybe I talk about that \u2013 bets for or against virtual reality, and much, much more. So please say hi to us on the socials and enjoy. Hello, boys and girls, and welcome to another episode of The Random Show. I think it is Episode 477. I\u2019m Tim Ferris. Kevin Rose: And I\u2019m Kevin Rose. Thanks for joining us. It\u2019s been awhile \u2013 a few months. Tim Ferriss: It has been. To be precise, it\u2019s been a long while. And we are sitting in your new place. Kevin Rose: I just moved in today. Tim Ferriss: A lot of life changes. Kevin Rose: Speaking of The Random Show, you hit me up last night and were like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s do a Random Show.\u201d It was midnight and you said on Tuesday. Yesterday was Tuesday and I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not getting out of bed to do a Random Show.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That would\u2019ve been very random, though. Kevin Rose: But you meant Wednesday. Tim Ferriss: I did mean Wednesday. Kevin Rose: You\u2019re in town for one night. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. It\u2019s just a sniper shot \u2013 in and out. I\u2019m excited to dig in because we have a bunch of new interests. But we also have new questions. I realized when I was just developing my Bambi legs in the podcasting and interview game \u2013 Kevin Rose: Episode One. Tim Ferriss: Episode One of The Tim Ferriss Show, which we didn\u2019t even have a name for at that point, although you nominated Tim Tim Talk Talk, which \u2013 Kevin Rose: I still think that\u2019s the best name and I think you should rename your show. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Go to hell. Kevin has stuck and people still refer to it as Tim Tim Talk Talk. Kevin Rose: I see that on Twitter from time to time and I always laugh my ass off when I see it. Tim Ferriss: Hopefully things have evolved and not devolved, but I remember you giving me so much shit when I put together my list of questions and asked you if you had to be a breakfast cereal which would you be. You were like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s going to be one of those interviews.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, stop busting my balls. I\u2019m nervous already even though you\u2019re my friend.\u201d It was my first time recording audio. So at some point, I\u2019m going to lob some questions at you that I\u2019ve asked a lot my other guests. I don\u2019t know your answers to them, and it sounds like you have some top secret questions to volley from your side. Kevin Rose: Yes. Before the show, Tim and I spent five or ten minutes putting together a bullet list of stuff we wanted to talk about. You mentioned wanting to do those new, refreshed questions on me. So of course, I have to come back to you and do some on you as well. You\u2019re always on the interviewing side of this equation. Why not throw some back to you and see what you come up with? I feel like you grill your guests sometimes. You\u2019re like, \u201cWhat would you put on a billboard,\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh!\u201d It\u2019s really difficult to answer this stuff in real time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, some of them are really tough in real time. Kevin Rose: I\u2019m curious to see how you\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ll see. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, we\u2019ll see how well I can tap dance. I\u2019ve grown better at the asking, but not necessarily the answering of questions. Do you have anything new on yours? I should also say, for those people who are wondering about the prep, we both bullet out a couple of items that are new for us \u2013 books, gizmos, or otherwise \u2013 but we don\u2019t share those notes with each other beforehand. Otherwise, it would be boring. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. We tend to leave it as fresh stuff we just came up with. It\u2019s typically stuff that we\u2019ve used and discovered since the last time we saw each other. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. Kevin Rose: I\u2019ve got three things \u2013 do you want me to kick it off with the first one? Tim Ferriss: Yes, please. Kevin Rose: So this one is actually thanks to you. I talked to you on the phone and talked to you about TM Meditation. Transcendental meditation is a form of meditation that I hadn\u2019t actually heard of until you first brought it up. I have a buddy, Anish, who\u2019s been doing it since he was a child. You know Anish. He was at my bachelor party. Tim Ferriss: I do. Kevin Rose: And also, our mutual Dr. Peter Attia \u2013 I was just talking to him and was asking, \u201cHey, what are some great ways you reduce stress in your life?\u201d He was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve looked at the literature.\u201d He\u2019s trained in TM as well. He did an introduction to some of the folks over at the center and I went and gave it a shot. I called you up and was like, \u201cWhat do you think,\u201d and you were like, \u201cYeah, go do it.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Peter\u2019s been on the podcast, and I was convinced to do my first proper training with TM by two other guests. It was Chase Jarvis and Rick Rubin, specifically. Kevin Rose: Oh crazy. Tim Ferriss: I effectively asked them the same question you asked Peter and it just took a while for it to get through my thick skull that I should try it because of the costs involved and various things. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s not cheap. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not cheap. And I may collaborate with some of the folks involved at the higher levels of TM to change that. We will see. There are some quirky aspects to it. You sent me a photograph of your \u2013 Kevin Rose: My sacrifice. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 flowers and fruit with the comment, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m joining a cult.\u201d For a secular person, it\u2019s a little tough. Kevin Rose: Here\u2019s the deal. I grew up religious and I drank the blood of Christ at communion and did all of that stuff. So I\u2019m used to certain formalities around certain things. I go to the introduction meeting, which is free, and I sat down in almost a church type setting. They welcome you and start explaining stuff. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, everything you\u2019re saying sounds great.\u201d They tell us the cost and I\u2019m like, \u201cA little pricy, but if it\u2019s going to change my life \u2013 whatever.\u201d And then they\u2019re like, \u201cBy the way, on your first day I want you to bring three pieces of fruit and some flowers for the introduction to the dude and an offering you must give him on the table. We burn incense.\u201d I was like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: And by the dude, you mean there\u2019s a large mural of the dude from The Big Lebowski. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. No, it\u2019s the founder. I never recall the founder\u2019s name. Tim Ferriss: Maharishi? Kevin Rose: Maharishi, yes. So whatever. I\u2019m not going to buy in if it\u2019s any kind of religious thing. Tim Ferriss: Darya\u2019s making faces. Kevin Rose: She is making faces. Are we allowed to talk about this, by the way? This is the other thing, they told us we couldn\u2019t talk about any of this stuff. Will they sue us? Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t think so. Ultimately, this is a ringing endorsement of the benefits of TM, probably. But there is some weird stuff. Let\u2019s call a spade a spade. And people have talked about it before. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Basically, you go into a little room. Tim Ferriss: Swing a dead cat over your head 13 times. No, you don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m kidding. Kevin Rose: You do your little ritual sacrifice thing. It\u2019s fine. I gave fruit. It lasts like 30 seconds. And then they give you a mantra. For people that don\u2019t know, there are a few different types of meditation. The type that I\u2019m used to is the head space variety, which is mindfulness. You sit there, you follow your breath, and your attention is directed at the in and out flow of your breath. That\u2019s kind of it. Mantra based meditation is taking a word that doesn\u2019t mean anything and you repeat it over and over and over in your head. You sit there for 20 minutes and you take this word \u2013 let\u2019s say it\u2019s cheeseburger \u2013 and you just think cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger over and over. Eventually, you enter this somewhat hypnotic state. Did you find that\u2019s where it took you as well? Tim Ferriss: It does. Or it can, I should say. I\u2019m sure there are people who are experts in this who would take issue with this analogy, but you can think of it as almost a white noise machine for a waking state. So if you use a white noise machine to help you get to sleep, then this would be the equivalent for helping you achieve a sort of alpha brainwave level of relaxed attentiveness that some people might associate with flow. So it does help you get into a hypnotic state. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: Where I find it very helpful is, if you feel compelled when you\u2019ve attempted meditation in the past to swat your thoughts away as if they were flies buzzing in your face, it can get very frustrating. By repeating a mantra, you\u2019re effectively overriding a lot of the internal dialogue or monologue. But yes, you can get into a very, very altered state of sorts \u2013 an enhanced state. Kevin Rose: Yes. It\u2019s a four-day training course and I did the first day. It was literally the fruit sacrifice and then the introduction of the mantra. By the way, the reason I said it\u2019s cheeseburger, cheeseburger is because they give you this mantra and you\u2019re not allowed to tell it to anyone. It\u2019s private, just for you. Later, I looked them up online and there are 15 of them. So you can just guess which one mine is. It starts with an \u201cM.\u201d I\u2019m just kidding. Essentially, you do that, and then I was a little upset. I finished day one and I was like, \u201cWhy did I really pay all of this money for this?\u201d Tim Ferriss: Why do I have to say Puttentang, puttentang? Kevin Rose: I literally read it on the Internet and I could just do it. I was like, \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt.\u201d I went back for day two and it all made sense and I stayed for the entire four days. It\u2019s not \u2013 Tim Ferriss: To be clear, when you say four days, it\u2019s like an hour or two a day. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I\u2019m talking about an hour and a half per day. Day two through four is all about helping you get over the little hurdles that appear throughout the entire process. It sounds simple, but as you\u2019re doing the mantra certain things happen. I was doing the mantra and I started syncing the mantra with my heartbeat. I was like, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s weird.\u201d So that distracted me and took me away from the mantra. I didn\u2019t know what to do and was kind of frozen. Imagine that, but probably 15 different things you will run into that are distractions. They teach you how to come back to the mantra, embrace that stuff, and that\u2019s where the value is. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s practical, tactical stuff, where there were two chief benefits \u2013 at least for me. You have someone holding you accountable to meditate for two sessions in between the inverse and meetings. There is a consequence (i.e. embarrassment) to not performing the assigned work. When I tried meditation in the past, I\u2019d buy a book and I\u2019d be like, \u201c90 percent of this makes no sense. I don\u2019t understand. But here\u2019s a little sidebar. Fine, I\u2019ll follow my breath.\u201d I\u2019d do it and I\u2019d be like, \u201cAm I doing this right? I don\u2019t know. I had all of these thoughts. I\u2019m no good at this. I\u2019m losing at meditation. I quit.\u201d Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: And after a few days, I would stop doing it. But when you have someone you\u2019re going to meet with each day who, in that hour and a half, is going to want to talk about your last two sessions, do post game analysis, and help you with the issues that came up, you feel compelled with social pressure of sorts. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it was great. Tim Ferriss: And the costs, quite frankly. If I were to point to a benefit of the payment \u2013 although I hesitate to do that \u2013 you succumb to the sunk cost fallacy. You\u2019re like, \u201cWell, I already paid for it, I might as well do it.\u201d Kevin Rose: Yeah. And I asked a ton of questions and got a lot of value out of it. It\u2019s been about a month and a half now. I\u2019ve been practicing and doing 40 minutes of meditation every day, seven days a week. Tim Ferriss: Two sessions, split into 20 minutes. Kevin Rose: Yes. My wife, Darya says she notices a big difference. I don\u2019t know. I feel a little bit more relaxed. My pressure points are if too much is going on in my life \u2013 if I have a lot of travel combined with work combined with board meetings combined with fundraising \u2013 I hit a certain critical mass and I break down a little bit. It\u2019s just too much going on. Why are you laughing? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m laughing because it just doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else. I don\u2019t know why you have this particular defect. I\u2019m joking. I missed you, too. Kevin Rose: But seriously, that hasn\u2019t happened as much. I\u2019ve been able to weather the storm a lot better. I\u2019m not experiencing any type of effect other than I will do the meditation and I will come out of it in a slight daze. They tell you when you finish the 20-minute session to spend three minutes slowly reintroducing yourself to the world. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like coming up from scuba diving. You have to equalize. Kevin Rose: Exactly. One time I didn\u2019t have that three minutes and I just got up and went, and I felt a little weird afterwards. The lady who was instructing me said, \u201cActually, if that\u2019s going to happen and you know you have to go out to some place, cut back the meditation time and still spend that three minutes.\u201d You go pretty deep inside yourself and you\u2019re a little dazed. People can get headaches and all kinds of things if they come out too fast. Tim Ferriss: Darya is pointing to a shirt that she had printed for herself that says, \u201cThat\u2019s what she said.\u201d Kevin Rose: And that\u2019s why I married my wife. She makes those kinds of jokes. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s make it more concrete. We were just at dinner together and Darya said you have been a rock in the best way possible, meaning very stable \u2013 a dramatic difference. For someone who is doing that type of work, it can be in some cases difficult to discern the progress. It\u2019s like if you\u2019re gaining half a pound of fat a month. A decade later, you\u2019re going to be pretty fat. But you won\u2019t notice it \u2013 Kevin Rose: Like a year later, you\u2019d be pretty fat, too. Tim Ferriss: That also. It\u2019s a terrible comparison, like the boiling frog, but you don\u2019t notice the improvement because you\u2019re exposed to it every day. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: And I noticed a big change in my sleep. Particularly the onset of sleep changed dramatically. I will be the first to admit I am not as consistent with afternoon sessions, so for me it\u2019s mostly first thing in the morning. This particular type of meditation is probably not for everyone, but it can be very useful for some people. I think the social accountability, the camaraderie, and the teacher/student relationship were what was most important for me. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I do like the foundation they put in place. Once you pay for the session \u2013 do you remember how much it was? $1,200.00 or something like that? Tim Ferriss: Something like that. The cost has decreased over time from $1,500.00 to $1,200.00. Kevin Rose: But you get to go back whenever you want. The teacher was like, \u201cCome back any time. You don\u2019t have to pay anything to hang out and I\u2019ll help you if you run into any more road blocks.\u201d They were really friendly people. Tim Ferriss: Let me give a couple of suggestions. The TM folks will probably hate me for this, but you can experiment with this using some type of mantra. I hate that term. I think it\u2019s very loaded. But you can use a word that is a two-syllable word, like nature. Kevin Rose: Well, it\u2019s not supposed to mean anything, though. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not supposed to mean anything, but let\u2019s not let perfect be the enemy \u2013 Kevin Rose: Ohm is a very common mantra. Tim Ferriss: You can use ohm also. For some people who are allergic to yoga like I was for a long time, they\u2019ll have negative associations. But you can use that. Even though I do have a mantra, I\u2019ve used that exact example of nature. Kevin Rose: What does your mantra start with? Tim Ferriss: I am not going to tell you. Kevin Rose: You can say the letter it starts with. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to lie to you. It starts with \u201cZ.\u201d I\u2019m such a hyper analytical person, I enjoy having a few superstitions I hold on to. Kevin Rose: You drank the Kool-Aid. You totally drank the Kool-Aid. Tim Ferriss: No, I also don\u2019t like using red pens for signing anything. Kevin Rose: Are you serious? Who even has a red pen? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I won\u2019t use red pens. I don\u2019t like cheersing with water. Kevin Rose: I don\u2019t like cheersing with water, either. That\u2019s just weird. I\u2019m not doing it for a superstition reason. It just feels strange. Tim Ferriss: So a couple of alternatives for people \u2013 Darya: [Inaudible \u2013 no mic] Kevin Rose: No, I\u2019m not. She was saying I\u2019m doing it for superstitious reasons. I just don\u2019t like the idea of everyone drinking alcohol and I don\u2019t have a glass of alcohol. Tim Ferriss: No, it\u2019s not superstition. It\u2019s pure hard science. Kevin Rose: I like alcohol. I want a glass of alcohol. Tim Ferriss: Okay, we won\u2019t belabor that. But for people who are interested in experimenting with this kind of thing, you can bootleg an imperfect variation of it and experiment. I do think people would derive benefit from it. But having someone who can answer very specific questions like, \u201cYou travel a lot. What are you going to do if room service knocks on the door and comes in while you\u2019re in the middle of meditation?\u201d Going through all of those contingencies is very valuable. But you pointed out one \u2013 headspace has worked tremendously well for a lot of my friends and a lot of people listening to this for that matter. Kevin Rose: Calm is another one that has worked well. Tim Ferriss: There are others who have enjoyed \u2013 and I\u2019ve enjoyed, frankly. I\u2019m not a purist about it. I\u2019ve used guided meditations from Tara Brach, who was introduced to me by Maria Popova of Brain Pickings. The guided meditations by Tara Brach are fantastic. She\u2019s also been on the podcast. Sam Harris has some great guided meditations. I think the website is samharris.org. There are many options out there for starting your day off in a relaxed, nonreactive, calmly effective state. And those are some of the options. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I agree with you. I would say if you\u2019re going to try mantra based meditation, try to pair up with a friend or someone you know who has done it before. They can help you get over those hurdles. The nice thing about paying for the class is that it truly is a forcing function to make you take it seriously. I went to day two because I was kind of pissed. I was like, \u201cWhy did I pay this much for it? I\u2019m going to get something out of it.\u201d After I went I actually got it. This is the way with all courses. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s true with a lot of skills, also, that are very frustrating in the beginning. Let\u2019s take slacklining as an example. Kevin Rose: Oh god. I tried that at your house. Tim Ferriss: Slacklining is difficult, and most people completely lose interest and quit after the first and second sessions. Neurologically, they\u2019re not capable of the neurological and muscular control and coordination. You need a certain \u2013 Kevin Rose: You saw me. It was like I was having seizures. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so you require a certain number of sleep cycles, as far as I can tell, to consolidate this procedural knowledge. Meditation, in this particular case, is very similar. It\u2019s like going out and snowboarding. I don\u2019t know anyone on the first day of snowboarding who was like, \u201cThat was so much fun.\u201d You just eat shit and catch edges and smash your head on the slopes \u2013 or your ass and tailbone \u2013 for the entire time. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: In the world of meditation, that\u2019s where 95-plus percent of people quit. If they were forced to do five days, they would see the potential. They would have one good run and they would be like, \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m hooked.\u201d Kevin Rose: That\u2019s why I like to take 10 from head space, where they take 10 days for 10 minutes a day. That was the first time I got through all 10 days and I was like, \u201cOh.\u201d It was about day eight when I got it. I was coming out of it more relaxed. I was feeling stronger as an individual after I did. Anyway, we don\u2019t have to talk about meditation the entire time. Tim Ferriss: The last thing I would say is it\u2019s very similar to physical training for non-reactivity. If have been interested in the stoic philosophical episodes that have been on this podcast before related to Seneca and a number of episodes by Ryan Holiday. Training that type of non-reactivity \u2013 meditation or mindfulness \u2013 mentally as you would train physically is a foundational skill that allows all the other pieces of the puzzle to function well. Alright, what\u2019s next. Kevin Rose: That was mine. What\u2019s yours? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll give a couple of specifics. One is a fiction book that I just finished. I have almost always been a nonfiction snob. I\u2019ve taken a very hoity toity position with fiction, which was, \u201cIf I just want to make stuff up, I can do that myself.\u201d Kevin Rose: I feel the same way. Tim Ferriss: I want to get something concrete out of a book. Kevin Rose: I don\u2019t want to waste the time. Tim Ferriss: If I\u2019m going to invest the time reading a book, it needs to be valuable, actionable, and have takeaways. I\u2019ve realized a few errors in that thinking. First, just as is the case with movies, there are movies or TV shows for entertainment, for stress relief \u2013 like Dumb and Dumber, which are brilliant in their own way. And then there are documentaries, like Fog of War, you might watch to learn something. I think it\u2019s very true with reading. You can better remember and incorporate some of the lessons from fiction because they are stories well told and we are programmed to be story remembering machines. The truths that are imbedded in fiction often are more utilitarian than the dense nonfiction that is just going to fall out of your brain like sand through the fingers. That\u2019s been my experience. I\u2019ve actually realized that fiction can have not only a rejuvenating and relaxing effect by turning off your problem solving apparatus, but you can actually imbed truths that are helpful. One book that was recommended by our mutual friend Chris Sacca. He\u2019s been on this podcast and is on track to be \u2013 if not already \u2013 the most successful venture capitalist of all time based on his first fund. The novel is How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia. I\u2019m blanking on the author\u2019s name. It\u2019s a Pakistani author. It\u2019s a fascinating novel that is beautifully written. I\u2019ve never seen such incredibly glowing reviews of any book. It\u2019s just woven together in such a powerful way. It\u2019s unique because of the voice and perspective that is used. The entire book is written from first person. It\u2019s like you awake to pain in your left eye. You\u2019re laying down under your mother\u2019s cot with your head on the dirt. Kevin Rose: Oh, I like this. This sounds cool. Tim Ferriss: I was told about this by Chris, who \u2013 Kevin Rose: It sounds like a video game almost. Tim Ferriss: It does. After Chris told me about this, I thought to myself, \u201cI should really read that.\u201d My second thought was, \u201cThat way of writing the book will be fascinating and cute for 10 pages and then it\u2019s going to drive me insane.\u201d It didn\u2019t at all. You just seamlessly become this character. I don\u2019t want to spoil it, but it\u2019s written as a parody of a self-help book, which is awesome and hilarious. There is a lot of truth and timeless wisdom imbedded in this book. Kevin Rose: Is it on Audible or just \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Oh, I\u2019m sure it is. Thank you, Darya. Yeah, there we go. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia by Mohsin Hamid. Kevin Rose: The reason we\u2019re not getting our facts right is I have no Internet at the house right now. Darya\u2019s looking things up on her phone. Tim Ferriss: Right. And here\u2019s the quote in there. Many liked this quote by Michiko Kakutani with The New York Times, \u201cAudacious\u2026 Hamid reaffirms his place as one of his generation\u2019s most inventive and gifted writers.\u201d It\u2019s a beautifully written book. If people are looking for a shift in the gears \u2013 perhaps a break from the relentless pursuit of dry facts, then I think this is a fantastic way to spend a few days. I got so into this, I read this book in maybe three days tops. I think it was two days, probably. I read it in a weekend. It\u2019s fantastic. So that would be the most recent read that I\u2019m into. I\u2019ll bring up one other one that\u2019s really weird. Maybe it\u2019s just an odd choice and an impulsive purchase. It\u2019s a book of poetry. I\u2019m not a poetry reader and I was in a Barnes & Noble at Union Square in New York City. There was a really thin collection of poetry sitting there called Night Sky with Exit Wounds. I think the author is Ocean Vuong. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s a great title. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s fantastic. Oh, that\u2019s what caught me. I\u2019m pretty sure the last name is Vietnamese. I opened this book that\u2019s very small and I started reading one poem in the morning when I wake up and one at night. Or, if I feel stressed, I use it just like I use fiction to short-circuit the pro/con hyper analytical, what-if brain that can drive me completely bonkers. It works really well. I will warn people about something I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve affected my purchase, but this author is very gay and very explicit. There is some pretty hardcore action in this book. If you\u2019re reading along and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhoa! Hey now! \u2013 Kevin Rose: Tim\u2019s into some crazy shit. Tim Ferriss: That will probably happen a few times. Some of the poems, I don\u2019t like at all, and that\u2019s okay. But every third or fourth I read \u2013 and this is a first for me \u2013 the wording is so evocative of unusual imagery. Like The Night Sky with Exit Wounds \u2013 it twists my brain. It\u2019s almost like mental yoga. My brain struggles to piece together an image that makes sense. A lot of these poems don\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense, but there are four or five turns of phrase that stretch my ability to visualize in such a way that I find it just opens doors to perception or gives me other lenses through which I can view the rest of my day. Kevin Rose: Sweet. Tim Ferriss: It sounds odd, I know, but I\u2019ve never really read or pursued poetry in this way. It was a very impulsive purchase based on chancing across this book. I think it\u2019s going to reignite my interest in certain types of poetry, like those that were introduced to me by Rolf Potts, the writer and author of Vagabonding, one of my favorite books. That\u2019s a to be continued. I don\u2019t think I will become a poet. I don\u2019t have the hubris to think I have the capacity for that, but also the way this book is formatted is so odd. As someone who is accustomed to narrative fiction or nonfiction, the words will be scattered around the page for one poem and then the next will be an unbroken paragraph of text with no punctuation. It\u2019s just so jolting that I find it serves as a pattern interrupt for me. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s almost like art, in a way. Tim Ferriss: Totally. Kevin Rose: You\u2019re getting a little piece of art on every page. Tim Ferriss: It absolutely is. That has been an interesting, unintended experiment of mine recently. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s awesome. Tim Ferriss: Another is that I am going to be, as promised, donating at least $100,000 to psychedelic research at top universities this year, 2016. I\u2019ve already raised $90-something-thousand for Johns Hopkins and the use of psilocybin for treatment resistant depression. That\u2019s depression that has not been addressable by any traditional means. I\u2019m going to be doing more work in funding research. Thank you for everybody who contributed to that campaign. It was a huge success. Things are already underway. I\u2019m very excited about what will be discovered that can be used in that trial. Kevin Rose: Give me the quick 30 seconds for people who aren\u2019t familiar with this. What is the trial? What are you testing? I get that it\u2019s depression that can\u2019t be treated with anything else. But what does the actual trial look like? What do they receive? Tim Ferriss: If people want to read all of the details, they can go to crowdrise.com/timferriss. The trial has actually been upgraded. It will be relatively small sample size. I\u2019m pulling this from memory, but I think it will be six to 12 people. Kevin Rose: Can I be one of the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Unfortunately, not, unless you want to move to Baltimore and fill out a very long questionnaire and qualify for it. But the purpose is to determine whether a single, or several, administrations of standardize psilocybin \u2013 I\u2019m guessing 0.25 to 0.35 milligrams per kilograms, which would translate to what would generally be considered heroic dose. If I get this wrong, you can go to my blog and leave a comment and let me know. We want to see the measurable effects and persistence of effects of psilocybin in patients who have not responded \u2013 chronic depression that has not been addressable or treatable with other pharmaceutical or therapeutic means. They will be also using FMRI and other imaging tools to try to determine if there is a demonstrable and statistically significant effect, how psilocybin has this particular effect. There is good science and more science on the way to indicate that there are some incredibly powerful applications of psilocybin, for instance in the treatment of different kinds of addiction. It can\u2019t be used for everything, but in terms of nicotine addiction or alcoholism, it\u2019s tremendously effective \u2013 at least based on the preliminary data we have thus far. Kevin Rose: When you\u2019re administering this psilocybin to someone \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Can I finish one thing? Kevin Rose: Yeah, yeah. Go for it. Tim Ferriss: The purpose of me bringing it up was not to say, \u201cHey, guys. I\u2019m donating a bunch of money to psilocybin. Please give me a gold star.\u201d It was to say that I\u2019m doing a second campaign. Instead of using crowdfunding, I want to run an experiment. I want to figure out not only what works or doesn\u2019t work in the scientific arena with these compounds, but what are the most effective nontraditional ways of fundraising for scientific studies. I\u2019ve already designed and will be selling a number of themed t-shirts that should be available by the time you hear this. You can check those out by going to fourhourworkweek.com/mushroom, which is traditionally where one finds psilocybin. It\u2019s not in all mushrooms, so don\u2019t go out foraging. That\u2019s a good way to get dead. I\u2019m curious to see if merchandising is a more efficient way to raise $100,000 for scientific research than crowdfunding. In turn, I will compare those to the usual approach, which is a director of development of a university or nonprofit has a dinner at someone\u2019s house where they invite a bunch of muckety-mucks and they have a one-on-one conversations infused with a lot of wine to convince people to donate money. Kevin Rose: Everyone gives $25,000 and that\u2019s what you hope for. Tim Ferriss: Or you try to land a whale. I want to see if there are more elegant ways of doing that. Kevin Rose: The t-shirt looks pretty cool. You\u2019re wearing it now and it\u2019s fantastic. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It\u2019s very comfortable. I spent a disturbing amount of time picking out the materials for these shirts. I\u2019m a real stickler. I\u2019ve seen some shirts I would\u2019ve been totally down to wear \u2013 from say South by Southwest, where every startup is giving away free shirts. That\u2019s generally a waste of money, by the way. But some of them are so comfortable that I\u2019ve worn ridiculous shirts just because they\u2019re a good material. Kevin Rose: They always give you extra-large, though. Tim Ferriss: But they give you extra-large muumuu shirts with a 20-by-20-inch logo that makes the front all stick and plastic. Who is going to wear that? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You tried to cut corners to make a minimally expensive shirt and as a result you wasted all of it. You spent $2.00 a shirt \u2013 Kevin Rose: It\u2019s more like $10.00, but yeah. Tim Ferriss: You spent $10.00 a shirt. You did 1,000 shirts because you didn\u2019t want to spend $15,000. And now that $10,000 is going to be entirely wasted because no one is going to wear it. You could\u2019ve just spent 50 percent more and actually have some measurable ROI of some type. It\u2019s a pet peeve. I fucking hate it. I have no fashion sense. I wear a lot of t-shirts. I think a lot of about t-shirt comfort. Kevin Rose: I have a question about mushrooms. Tim Ferriss: Yes? Kevin Rose: The typical college Kevin that has experience with mushrooms is you get a chocolate, you get a bag, or something like that. When you do these trials, how do they measure this stuff? Are they grinding up mushrooms and weighing them out? How do they actually administer \u2013 Tim Ferriss: My understanding is that it\u2019s synthesized. It would be extracted, but this is actually one of the largest constraints, with a compound that is as tracked and regulated as plutonium \u2013 it\u2019s scheduled in the same class as cocaine and heroin. So it is extremely difficult to get the approvals on many different levels, including IRB for human trials, to initiate this type of research. I need experts here for accuracy, but for the sake of argument, let\u2019s just say you get all of the approvals. You want to get five grams of psilocybin, it\u2019s something crazy like $15,000 a gram to get a hold of it because there are no economies of scale. Kevin Rose: Who\u2019s growing it? It\u2019s not being grown, it\u2019s all synthesized. Tim Ferriss: Synthesized or extracted \u2013 I don\u2019t know specifically. There is a nonprofit called Usona which has purchased a very large quantity so they can then distribute at cost to researchers. It\u2019s a brilliant approach and they\u2019re doing this all through legitimate, legal means. They have all the necessary clearances. It removes the largest constraints currently, which is capital. Universities have fundraising and it has to be allocated. If you have a six-person study and it\u2019s going to cost an additional $50,000-$100,000, even if all of your research is well planned and all of the proper boxes checked, if you don\u2019t have the money, you don\u2019t have the money. So this will in part remove that limitation. It should greatly improve the number of researchers who are performing studies using psilocybin, which is very exciting. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s great. The first time I read about it being used in research was probably about six to eight months ago. There was a study done in New York. This kid that was studying to become a doctor came down with cancer and he was having absolutely horrible anxiety. He knew how to check himself because he was premed. He was rubbing his lymph nodes all the time and freaking out, to the point where the doctors were like, \u201cYou need to stop rubbing your lymph nodes.\u201d He was causing rashes. He went off the deep end. They had this study and he took part. He swallowed these capsules of psilocybin and knocked out his anxiety 100 percent. Even though he still had stage four cancer, he was just okay with dying at that point. Tim Ferriss: This is one of the areas that is very active. It\u2019s end of life anxiety or depression for, in instance, terminal cancer patients. There is a very good article written some time ago by Michael Pollan called The Trip Treatment. It was in The New Yorker and is very much worth reading. It talks a good deal about this. That is one type of study that I will be funding more of. There are actually two on deck. It is very important to fund studies that are easily defended at this nascent stage of research, with a very unfairly scheduled compound. You have to really be on the up and up and on the best behavior, and have as many assurances and insurances as possible, to ensure you can defend this study scientifically and politically. These particular populations in the early stages are important to choose wisely. It\u2019s very hard to say, \u201cFuck the cancer patient who\u2019s going to die. Let that guy have incredible anxiety and depression.\u201d It\u2019s very hard to attack that. Similarly, I find it very compelling to look at the treatment resistant depression, something that has not responded to other medical options to date, or veterans with PTSD. Kevin Rose: Don\u2019t you feel like you could use marijuana as a template here? They\u2019ve been very successful at creating cannabis related compounds to treat and help cancer patients with pain and other things. That was kind of the foot in the door strategy to open the door to further research other things. Tim Ferriss: Potentially. I\u2019ve spoken with some people who have had very deep involvement on the political legislative side with cannabis. I do think there are lessons to be learned \u2013 both things to do and not to do. So that\u2019s something I\u2019ve continued to be very passionate about. Kevin Rose: Sweet. Tim Ferriss: If you want some super comfy t-shirts that\u2019ll make your nipples hard in a good way, go to fourhourworkweek.com/mushroom. One is very subtle. One is not so subtle. You can decide if you want to support some team colors. All of the proceeds, 100 percent, are going to directly to research. That is something I\u2019m very much looking forward. Kevin Rose: Awesome. I have one quick little book and then we can move into the Q&A. Does that sound good? Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s do it. Kevin Rose: The book I\u2019m halfway through right now \u2013 and I hate to recommend something I\u2019m only halfway through, but I\u2019m really enjoying it. It\u2019s called Moonwalking with Einstein. Have you read it? Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t, but I know a good deal about it. Joshua Foer? Kevin Rose: Yes. He was a writer that was covering national memory champions. So he was assigned this beat and he thought he was going to write a single article about these memory champions and then he got pulled into actually performing and learning the tricks of the trade to become a memory champion. Tim Ferriss: Now memory champion includes things like memorizing the order of the cards in a shuffled deck. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. Or an unpublished poem handed to you, and names and faces of 50-some people. They hand you these cards with names and faces and you get a minute to memorize all of the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I think DigiStrings, maybe? Kevin Rose: Yeah, you use random strings of digits. It\u2019s insane stuff that for someone like me, who has a really horrible memory, to be attracted to this book. Where I\u2019m at right now, they talk about this idea of a memory palace. Do you know much about this? Tim Ferriss: I know all about it. The loci technique. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Give your take on it. I\u2019m curious. Tim Ferriss: I used to be really into this stuff. Also, Ed Cook, who is the coach in Moonwalking with Einstein is a very close friend of mine. Kevin Rose: No way! That\u2019s amazing. Tim Ferriss: He has been on the podcast, talking about memory stuff. Kevin Rose: Are you serious? How did I miss that episode? That\u2019s awesome. Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s great. We did it when I was on the West Coast and he was in London, so he had plenty of booze. It was great. He\u2019s a hilarious Brit to start with. Kevin Rose: They talk about him drinking in the episode and going out \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Oh, it\u2019s not joke. Kevin Rose: \u2013 and using it to hit on girls and stuff, by memorizing. Tim Ferriss: Ed is hilarious. You should definitely check out the episode. Memory Palace has been used for ages in one form or another in many different cultures. It\u2019s also called the loci technique, which means location. The way it\u2019s used is very simple. You have a predetermined location or route that you\u2019re familiar with and you can then, in the process of giving yourself a tour of this location in a predetermined say clockwise fashion around the perimeter of the inside of a concert hall, or walking from your front door to your favorite coffee shop where you pass 16 different buildings and a bunch of different landmarks, you can place items that you want to remember along that route in a particular order. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: And that allows you to do some very interesting things. Not only can you remember things by using imagery \u2013 which we\u2019re very visual creatures \u2013 you can also recall them out of order. I used to do this as a party trick in college. I was a neuroscience major, and for a very brief flash in time, I was very interested in how to stretch the capacity of cognition. You can take the abstract and convert it into the concrete, ideally in the form of images. You can do that with numbers. For instance, you can take the numbers from one to one hundred, convert the numbers zero to nine into specific letters. So let\u2019s just say zero is \u201cS\u201d or \u201cZ.\u201d One is \u201cT\u201d or \u201cD,\u201d which both have one down stroke. Three is \u201cM,\u201d three down strokes. Four is \u201cR,\u201d \u2013 the last letter is R. And then let\u2019s just say you decide well in advance that 12, as an example, is TN. Anytime you have a 12, it\u2019s automatically TN. Maybe that\u2019s the Tin Man. So let\u2019s just say you have a route from your front door to your coffee shop and somebody gives you a one-dollar bill, a five-dollar bill, a ten, and a twenty. You say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to memorize the serial code numbers on all of these and give them back to you. I would take pairs of numbers and go in fours. My first stop \u2013 I walk out the door and there\u2019s a yellow fire hydrant. That\u2019s the first landmark that I pass. If the first four numbers are like 1270 \u2013 I\u2019m making that up. Seven is a \u201cK\u201d and zero is an \u201cS\u201d or a \u201cZ,\u201d like I said. So 1270. So TN \u2013 I have Tin Man. 70 \u2013 KZ would be one. KZ I associate with this guy named Bill Kazmaier, who was the World\u2019s Strongest Man champion for ages. He\u2019s a complete beast. I know what he looks like. So now I have the Tin Man and Kazmaier fighting around this yellow fire hydrant. Now I have four numbers. I can move on to the next one. By doing that, you can get to the point very quickly where you\u2019re memorizing 100-plus random numbers at a time. It\u2019s really incredible. Kevin Rose: So I\u2019ll give you my very first exercise in the book. It\u2019s the same idea. This time you picture your childhood house. Everyone tends to know their childhood house pretty well \u2013 or a location you know quite well and have lived there for a long time. They start you off at the sidewalk right by your mailbox. So you think you\u2019re going to put an item down right there. In this case, he wants you to memorize 15 different items on a grocery shopping list. The first thing is pickled garlic. So you put a glass of pickled garlic right there, when you\u2019re walking in, right on the corner. You visualize the glass. You visualize how it tastes in your mouth, the logo on the outside, the type of screw down cap that it has \u2013 and the more connections you can make to how it feels and how it tastes, the stronger the reinforcement is in your brain. So that is one location. So just like you, the next one up is by your garage door or the front door. The next one is inside the house or in your kitchen or whatever comes next. You pick these 10 different locations and you place one object down at each location. Sure enough, I can go back days later and tell you exactly where the pickled garlic was. Tim Ferriss: Almost anyone can do this. If you use the same location over and over and over again, I found there was a fair amount of interference and I would get confused because I would recall something I had already put in this specific place. If I was sitting in the equivalent of a bar on Princeton\u2019s campus hanging out with somebody and they\u2019re like, \u201cI heard you do some weird memory shit.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cDance for me, monkey.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cOkay.\u201d So I would actually look around the room I was sitting in and I would place the images around the room. It was so unique a signature and frame that I would see the person two or three days later and I\u2019d be like, \u201cHey, do you still have that five in your wallet?\u201d I\u2019d quote the serial code backwards and they\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat?!\u201d People can get to that level of proficiency within a week or two of practice. It\u2019s not complicated. Kevin Rose: Anyway, this is a great book. I\u2019m enjoying it so far. If you\u2019re looking to improve your memory, there are a bunch of little tricks they\u2019re starting to unveil about halfway through the book. It\u2019s been a fun read and it\u2019s also on Audible. That\u2019s how I got it. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve heard great things about it. There is another book for those of you who want a compliment that I found extremely helpful. I haven\u2019t seen the book in 20 years, but I think the author is Higbee. Your Memory and How to Improve It. Kevin Rose: Cool. I\u2019ll check that one out as well. Tim Ferriss: That is a tremendous resource. In my sophomore year, all of the recreational reading I did was related to pneumonic devices and studying this type of \u2013 some people call it artificial enhancement of memory. Kevin Rose: That is so funny. I didn\u2019t even know this when I sat down. You didn\u2019t know I was going to bring this book up. Tim Ferriss: I had no idea. There is another book that is just basically a description of a super mind called Mind of Mnemonist by A.J. Luria. It talks about synesthesia and all of this crazy, Rainman-like abilities and beyond. I thought it was very inspiring, but it also highlighted that, when you have those types of gifts, it\u2019s often a very mixed bag. You have a lot of issues. Kevin Rose: Yeah, they bring that up a lot in this book. They walk through a couple of profiles of individuals that have had more or less perfect memories. It\u2019s very daunting not to be able to forget certain things. It actually has really bad \u2013 you want to be able to forget certain things. We\u2019re built to forget certain things. It shows the consequences there, and they\u2019re not pretty. Tim Ferriss: No, they\u2019re not. That\u2019s why, when I look at technology and living in Silicon Valley as I do, and the perspective of memory enhancement using technological means \u2013 I think there is a lot of promise in developing some of these technologies. They\u2019re well into development at this point. Kevin Rose: Are you talking about \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: No, I\u2019m not talking about TDCS \u2013 the transcranial direct current stimulation. Kevin Rose: That sounds right. Tim Ferriss: No, I\u2019ve experimented with that. Kevin Rose: Have you? Tim Ferriss: I have. Kevin Rose: Gosh, we could just keep going on and on. We need to get to Q&A. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, we\u2019ll do Q&A. And if you guys want to talk more about cognitive enhancement and memory, we can certainly do that. Kevin Rose: We do should do \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Actually, I have another recommendation for people. Have you guys seen Black Mirror? Kevin Rose: No. Tim Ferriss: Oh my god. Kevin Rose: I saw Black Swan. Wait, I did see \u2013 you mean, the little miniseries? Tim Ferriss: The miniseries that\u2019s like The Twilight Zone based on technology. Kevin Rose: Yeah. The first one was just kind of like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Look, the first one is creepy and gross. But I really enjoyed it. There are some very good episodes. Kevin Rose: I watched the one where the President\u2019s daughter gets kidnapped or whatever. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I think that\u2019s the first one. It\u2019s a mind trip, but there\u2019s one episode about a not-too-distant-future where you can replay memories because your waking reality is being recorded through your eye. You can replay them, project them for people, rewind, search for certain things \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far away. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s crazy. Tim Ferriss: But it definitely highlights some of the risks involved with that. Kevin Rose: It could be amazing, but it also could be really horrible. Tim Ferriss: I think it will be both. Alright. Q&A. Kevin Rose: Let\u2019s do it. Tim Ferriss: You want to take a stab first? Kevin Rose: I want to start first. This is kind of fun. I get to interview you on your podcast. I guess The Random Show is our shared show, but this is more or less your channel. What is one illegal substance that you\u2019ve tried that has changed you for the better? Tim Ferriss: Got Tim Tim on this one. Psilocybin. Kevin Rose: Psilocybin? That\u2019s your number one? Tim Ferriss: I had a number of very transformative and formative experiences with psilocybin that were the tipping point for certain decisions and reprogramming. Kevin Rose: What did it do for you? Clearly, as mentioned just a few minutes ago with the research you want to do, something happened and it changed you. What was the change? Tim Ferriss: I would say I\u2019ve always been a worrier. I\u2019ve always had a fair degree of anxiety, which is not uncommon among A-type personalities. Kevin Rose: This is me to the tee right now. Tim Ferriss: I heard at one point \u2013 and I want to know the attribution on this, so somebody please let us know. Hit us up on Twitter. Kevin Rose: @timferriss. Tim Ferriss: @kevinrose. This expression I heard and rang so true to me was, \u201cAnxiety is being trapped in the future and depression is being trapped in the past.\u201d So if you\u2019re a planner and a control freak, what are you doing? You\u2019re constantly planning. What if this? What if that? Contingency A. Contingency B. It\u2019s makes you a fucking stress case. Kevin Rose: Dude, that\u2019s me. Tim Ferriss: And it manifests in different ways. Some people get angry. Some people start losing their temper. Other people develop physical symptoms \u2013 GI discomfort, acid reflux, or whatever it might be. Kevin Rose: I\u2019ve had it all big time. Tim Ferriss: My experience is that sufficient dose \u2013 and this is something you really need to do with proper supervision. I\u2019m not just saying that as ass covering, liability lip service. There are many cases of people using psychedelics in the wrong circumstances and dying. You can make very bad decisions \u2013 step out in front of traffic, jump out of a window. There are many different ways you can horribly injure or kill yourself if this is not used in a responsible way. Kevin Rose: But not from overdosing psilocybin, right? Tim Ferriss: No, it\u2019s from making very poor decisions because you think you can fly or something. Kevin Rose: Or drive your car or something stupid. Tim Ferriss: All terrible ideas. You need proper supervision. But with all of those caveats, let\u2019s use a comparison. I think we\u2019ve all had the experience of opening up a computer and you have 30 tabs open. You\u2019re running out of storage. I\u2019m looking at Kevin\u2019s computer right now. It looks just like mine. You have 30 tabs open \u2013 warning, startup disk almost full. Oh shit. What do I do? And then Dropbox is syncing. Why is my computer running so slow? Oh, Slack\u2019s also on. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhy is my system so goddamn slow?\u201d Oh, the antivirus is on. Kevin Rose: You have antivirus on a Mac? Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t. For me, a moderate to high dose of psilocybin serves as a hard reboot. It just cleans that entire system, flushes the cache, and allows me to regain a 30,000-foot view. Sanity in view of larger pictures and my most important priorities \u2013 and remove all of that noise. The anxiolytics \u2013 the anxiety decreasing and depression suppressing effect for me, the first time I used it, lasted three to six months. It was unbelievable how persistent it was. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: I would say that is my answer. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s fascinating. Good answer. Tim Ferriss: Thanks. I\u2019m going to ask a few questions that I don\u2019t think I got around to asking the first time. Kevin Rose: Alright. Tim Ferriss: When you hear the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind and why? Kevin Rose: I would probably say Philip Rosedale. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Who is Philip and why? Kevin Rose: He created Second Life virtual world way back in the day. I have interviewed him on my show Foundation. Back in the day, I had a podcast called Foundation. You can still find it. I think it\u2019s foundation.bz. The reason that I like him is on a couple of fronts. I feel that he is a very creative person that fully accepts risk and goes in headfirst. He is willing to try really wild and crazy ideas and really doesn\u2019t care if they fail. He has done that throughout his career and has been very successful at it. I really admire people that aren\u2019t afraid of failure and are willing to try big, bold things. Elon Musk would be an easy answer on this front because he\u2019s trying so many really cool, big, bold ideas. Tim Ferriss: The founders of Google are another example. Kevin Rose: Yeah, but I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I think it was Larry Page that said one of the things people miss is that, if you aim big enough it\u2019s very hard to fail completely. You take something from it or learn lesson that you can then parlay into the next thing that\u2019s successful. Kevin Rose: The problem I have with the founders of Google \u2013 I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting these guys and I think they\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not knocking them at all. They\u2019re really brilliant and have created an amazing organization that continues to do great work. The reason I like Philip and picked him over the founders of Google \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re mad about your AdSense account. Kevin Rose: They banned my AdSense account. No, seriously, it\u2019s because Philip has these ideas that are just so crazy. You\u2019ll have to go back and listen to my other podcast about how to manage people and projects and get group think to come together and create beautiful things. They\u2019re kind of out of this world ideas and I\u2019m attracted to that. For some reason, I like the really crazy thinkers. I just had Jason Fried on my podcast that I do for the Journal. He has created an amazing start-up. We were talking about the culture he creates in his company. He said, \u201cI want to pay people for getting eight hours of sleep.\u201d And he wants to track that. You come in with your Fitbit, you open your account and it shows you slept a full eight hours and you get paid a bonus. That\u2019s amazing. He really cares about how he can take care of the entire life cycle of an individual in ways he\u2019s never heard about before. Those are the types of ideas that aren\u2019t just, \u201cHow can we create a better browser? How can we create a self-driving car?\u2019 They\u2019re just \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m smirking because I was thinking with a Fitbit you could try to pay people for having an hour of sex a day. It has an accelerometer. It could figure it out. You\u2019d have to wear a belt while you were boning, I guess. Darya\u2019s question was, \u201cWhere would you attach it?\u201d No, that\u2019s true. Kevin Rose: There could be a Fitbit cock ring or something. Seriously, let me say one last thing on this topic and then we can move on. Tim Ferriss: The butterfly. Kevin Rose: You\u2019ve got my head all messed up now. I think that in being a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley for so many years, we see the same pitches over and over. You see modifications of, \u201cHey, I\u2019m the Uber for this. I\u2019m the Twitter for that. I\u2019m the Myspace for this.\u201d Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s just the incremental YouTube also around stuff. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s the Peter Thiel true zero-to-one jump \u2013 those big ideas that are new and beautiful and ugly and scary, that you find them so rarely in founders. I like those types of founders, so that\u2019s why he came to mind. Tim Ferriss: Phil Rosedale has a tremendous amount of stamina. He\u2019s been in the game for a long time. He knows how to modulate. He\u2019s been very consistent. Kevin Rose: Big time meditator, too. He invented his own form of meditation. I\u2019m not joking. Tim Ferriss: What characterizes it? Kevin Rose: He counts to like 10,000 a day. He does mantra-based meditation based on counting. Tim Ferriss: Just single digits? 1, 2, 3 \u2013 Kevin Rose: Yeah. We were sitting there and he was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m at 587 right now.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Wait. He does it \u2013 Kevin Rose: Every day. Tim Ferriss: No, no. As he\u2019s doing other activities? Oh, my god. That sounds difficult. Kevin Rose: He doesn\u2019t stop to do it. He\u2019ll have like three minutes. Tim Ferriss: He\u2019ll be on a conference call and he\u2019s at like 6,737. Kevin Rose: Right, and then he stops and he goes \u2013 and if he has a minute he does an extra 100. Tim Ferriss: Oh, he picks up. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That sounds so stressful. Kevin Rose: It totally does for me, but it works for him. Tim Ferriss: Whatever works. Kevin Rose: Next question. It\u2019s after midnight now. If you could change any law, what would it be. And you can\u2019t say drugs. Tim Ferriss: Let me think about this for a second. Kevin Rose: Is there anything that just drives you nuts and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhy is that a law?\u201d You have to have some political somewhere \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I do. I\u2019ve gone through this recently. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a libertarian. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. I think that there are laws \u2013 and perhaps all laws should be revisited and reassessed on occasion. There are certain laws that are put in place to, in the best cases, create the greatest good for the greatest number of people in circumstances that then change. For instance, I\u2019m building a barrel sauna and it\u2019s relatively small. It looks like a gigantic wine barrel. It\u2019s based on plans that were given to me by Rick Rubin, who got them from Laird Hamilton. It\u2019s an incredible set-up. It\u2019s surprisingly inexpensive. And to put that on my own property, out of view of any neighbors, was just like trying to broker a fucking peace treaty between North and South Korea. Kevin Rose: Why did you tell your neighbors? Tim Ferriss: No, no. It has nothing to do with my neighbors. It has everything to do with getting city and town permits and all of that kind of stuff. Kevin Rose: No, don\u2019t do that. Just do it yourself. Tim Ferriss: Just don\u2019t do it? No, no, no. You have to do that. In any case, this is just one example. I\u2019m generally a small government guy. I really feel like, if you look at for instance crises or natural disasters \u2013 in earthquakes, in the blitz where London was being bombed in World War II, people develop social structures and rules that keep the peace and assign roles to different types of people and create order amongst themselves. Now, I\u2019m not an anarchist. I\u2019m not saying the government shouldn\u2019t exist. But I do think that we\u2019ve edged too far into a nanny state type of dependency that is not a healthy dependency whatsoever. It\u2019s created a stifling environment for certain things \u2013 whether it is this barrel sauna or hiring really good non US citizens to work at your startup. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s a big issue. Tim Ferriss: I know a lot of icons in Silicon Valley have been working on it, but why is this so hard? It is completely ludicrous. Especially based in a country where the blend of cultures and innovation we have is directly a consequence of massive immigration. It\u2019s outrageous. In any case, that\u2019s my rant. If I could change any law \u2013 nothing super specific. Kevin Rose: The sauna laws. Tim Ferriss: I need to provide more money to the sauna lobby. Kevin Rose: Do a fundraiser for the sauna law and get a t-shirt. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sure I could come up with a better answer if I thought more about it. Oh, here\u2019s one. I think that it should be easier for a loved one to take their loved one off of life support, or provide ethical euthanasia in cases where that has been sort of prearranged. I don\u2019t think the state should have a say in that. I think if that is something that has been documented and agreed upon beforehand, that should be an option in more circumstances. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Sucks to see people suffer. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: Alright, what\u2019s my question? Tim Ferriss: These are pretty short ones. What is the book or books that you\u2019ve gifted most to other people? Kevin Rose: Number one would be Miracle of Mindfulness. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s Thich Nhat Hanh. Kevin Rose: Right. Have you ever read that book? Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a great book. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it\u2019s great. It was the one that really got me into mindfulness and applying it to everyday life. There is a story in there where he talks about washing the dishes to wash the dishes. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, instead of thinking about the plum that you\u2019re going to eat after the dishes. Kevin Rose: Exactly. It\u2019s such a good anecdote, though. Tim Ferriss: I know. Kevin Rose: The point being, if you\u2019re thinking about the plum when you\u2019re washing the dishes, when you\u2019re eating the plum you\u2019re going to be thinking about your fucking email or whatever it is. His whole thing is we should be in the moment and focusing on the task at hand, putting our full attention on that, and really living that moment. This is just a great short read. You can pick it up on Amazon for like $12.00. It\u2019s not an expensive book and it\u2019s one of my favorites when it comes to mindfulness. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s second place? Kevin Rose: Just because of doing the whole social Internet thing in the early days, I would say Wisdom of Crowds was a big one for me. That meant a lot to me and there are still some great little tidbits in there. Tim Ferriss: Green Eggs and Ham? Kevin Rose: I think those are probably my top two. Tim Ferriss: Fantastic. Since I gave a longwinded answer, I\u2019ll give you some air time and I\u2019ll ask another question. A purchase of $100.00 or less that has positively impacted your life. Kevin Rose: I hate to plug my other podcast, but on episode two I went out and interviewed this guy that is a master of pens. He knows more about pens than we do about anything else on earth. He recommended three pens that have the absolute best rollerball pen, the best fountain pen \u2013 and these are all $4.00 pens. Some of them are really hard to find. Some you can only find in Japan. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s convenient. Kevin Rose: But you can find them online. I swapped out my entire stock of pens at my desk with these cheap little $3.00 to $4.00 pens and they\u2019re amazing. Tim Ferriss: Do you recall the names of any of them? Kevin Rose: Yes, I can put them in your show notes. I will get his top there and they\u2019ll be in the show notes. Tim Ferriss: Alright. We\u2019ll put these in the show notes, guys. Fourhourworkweek.com/podcast \u2013 you can find show notes for this and all of the other episodes. Kevin Rose: But I think for me that represents who I am as a person. I like to geek out on something and go really deep. I think you\u2019re like this, too. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m definitely like this, too. Kevin Rose: You find something you\u2019re into and I\u2019m like, \u201cReally? There\u2019s a better pen? Tell me more.\u201d And we ended up having a 30- or 40-minute podcast about notebooks and pens. That was super geeky, but I have some awesome notebooks now. Tim Ferriss: I dig pens. I have a bit of a pen fetish myself, so this is right up my alley. Kevin Rose: The next question for you \u2013 what is one body experiment you wish you didn\u2019t do? Tim Ferriss: One physical experiment that I wish I didn\u2019t partake in \u2013 Kevin Rose: You can\u2019t mention the double circumcision. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sorry I did that to Toaster. I do regret that. Sorry, Toasty. Kevin Rose: He\u2019s still in pain. Tim Ferriss: Good boy. The one that comes to mind is \u2013 I was in Cape Town, South Africa, doing research related to a number of chapters in The 4-Hour Body. I was getting muscle biopsies, which involve having something the side of a large pen stabbed into the side of your leg to cut muscle tissue out \u2013 not super comfy. That one I don\u2019t regret. That got me a lot of really interesting enzymatic information related to endurance and a muscle fiber analysis. I was at the Sports Science Institute of South Africa and Dr. Timothy Noakes is there. He\u2019s incredibly well versed in the worlds of ultra-endurance and hydration, or lack thereof, and how the body responds to different states of hydration. I wanted to do a very well established running test. It was going to be an endurance test, which I\u2019m not known for to start with. I decided that I could use every advantage possible and I had read in a number of places that resveratrol, which most people associate with longevity \u2013 Kevin Rose: The red wine compound. Tim Ferriss: The excuse they use to drink red wine, when in reality you\u2019d have to have like 72 cases a day to get the therapeutic dose used in clinical. Resveratrol also has some incredible implications for endurance. I remember seeing this video \u2013 I believe it was Super Rat. There was normal rat and then super rat running on a treadmill. I want to say it was David Sinclair, perhaps, who did this. Kevin Rose: And they gave super rate resveratrol. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s endurance doubled. It\u2019s run time to exhaustion doubled. I said, \u201cOkay, well let me look at the research and figure out the dosage they used on the rats \u2013 the milligrams per kilograms.\u201d And then I \u2013 Kevin Rose: Oh my god. You ratted yourself. Tim Ferriss: I ordered like five months\u2019 worth of resveratrol \u2013 like multiple bottles. Kevin Rose: Oh no. Tim Ferriss: Don\u2019t do this at home, kids \u2013 I consumed all of the bottles. I had to consume something like 120 capsules to get the proper milligrams per kilogram. Kevin Rose: Why would you do this? This is dumb. Tim Ferriss: There are a couple off issues, folks, for those of you who haven\u2019t realized this is dumb yet. I couldn\u2019t figure out a way to expeditiously have this administered through injection, which is almost certainly how it was given to these rats. They didn\u2019t feed the rats resveratrol chow, I\u2019m pretty sure. They most likely injected it intramuscularly or intravenously. I didn\u2019t have that as an option, so I did it orally. Well, there are a bunch of issues that come up here. I\u2019ll just flash forward and give you guys a snapshot and then explain what happened. I\u2019m sitting there in this meeting and there was a serious, brilliant, hilarious guy sitting there. He\u2019s like explaining this very seriously to me and it\u2019s like a 10-minute intro to what I\u2019m about to do. Out of nowhere, I start sweating fucking bullets \u2013 a cold sweat. Kevin Rose: How many pills did you take at this point? Tim Ferriss: Oh, I had all of them a half hour beforehand. I had 90 or 120 capsules. Kevin Rose: So you\u2019re drinking like 10 at a time and gulping them down. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I\u2019m good at swallowing pills. I get this profuse cold sweat out of nowhere pouring down my face. He\u2019s giving me this very serious speech and I\u2019m trying to pay attention because the sweat\u2019s coming into my eyes. He\u2019s like, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kevin Rose: You\u2019re like, \u201cI need a hamster wheel stat.\u201d Tim Ferriss: I was like, \u201cDo you have a bathroom nearby.\u201d He points me down the hallway and I do the butt squeeze waddle down the hallway and do a reverse bra jump through the stall and just stay there for the next 45 minutes. I didn\u2019t realize \u2013 what was not listed on the ingredient list on these pills \u2013 there\u2019s something used as a filler called imoden, and imoden acts as a laxative. I was just a disaster. Needless to say, it completely killed my endurance. I did the running test. It was 10 times worse than it would\u2019ve been if I had not swallowed 120 pills. Kevin Rose: You probably like lost a ton of water and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Oh, it was a complete disaster. So that was \u2013 Kevin Rose: You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t have some crazy, horrible side effect like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Look, I don\u2019t recommend mimicking that behavior, but to the extent possible I did do my homework. I read a lot on PubMed. I knew there was a risk that I would have GI distress, I just didn\u2019t know that it would be like \u2013 Kevin Rose: That severe. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 exorcist style out the other end type of issue. Live and learn. I saw a t-shirt here in New York City. It said bad decisions make good stories, so I guess this is one of those examples. Kevin Rose: There you go. Tim Ferriss: What advice would you give to your 20- or 25-year-old self? Place us where you are and what you\u2019re doing. Kevin Rose: I don\u2019t know whether I should go 20 or 25. Let\u2019s go 25. Right around that time was when I was creating Digg for the first time. It exploded and got a bunch of users and we grew the company to a pretty decent size. The issue was, at that age, I was still really immature. If I would sit down with my younger self, I would say to that person to seek out mentors and stop acting like you know it all. When I didn\u2019t know something, I refused to learn it. I wanted to focus on what I already knew I was good at. I was really good at the creative side and coming up with new feature ideas and product ideas, but when it came down to hiring staff or interviewing folks \u2013 all of the other pieces of business you have to learn in order to succeed \u2013 I didn\u2019t have any of that. Rather than admit I didn\u2019t know it, I just turned a blind eye to it. That caused a lot of problems later. I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to focus on this small domain and hire other people to take over my weak spots.\u201d I first of all didn\u2019t know how to hire the right folks. We hired some great people, but gave the keys to the castle to folks rather than taking on the hard work, which was admitting I didn\u2019t know these things and putting in the time and effort to become proficient in them. That\u2019s what I\u2019d go back to that 25-year-old self with. It\u2019s a lot of the stuff that I\u2019m still learning today. As a fourth or fifth time entrepreneur having a startup, I\u2019m putting in a lot of time and effort. I feel like I\u2019m mature enough now at almost 40. If I don\u2019t know something, I immediately go and say, \u201cWho is the smartest person in the room? Who can point me in the right direction so I can get schooled on this.\u201d It\u2019s important. You can\u2019t just shuffle that stuff to the side and let an ego get in the way when it shouldn\u2019t be. Tim Ferriss: That makes perfect sense. The short-term ego pain prevents the long-term catastrophic pain. Kevin Rose: Right. Exactly. And it only happens once. You have that small little bash to your ego for 10 minutes, but you get introduced to the right folks and you admit that you don\u2019t know something. And guess what, that never comes up again. You can go and get schooled up on that. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s good advice. What is the worst advice that you hear being thrown around to startup founders, or in general? What is some bad advice that\u2019s given frequently? Kevin Rose: Well, I\u2019ve seen many a startup that believes that when they have a little bit of traction it\u2019s the time to go raise a bunch of capital and spend into that and hope for the best. Oftentimes, you see a lot of bloat created and a lot of extra pressure to hit certain milestones that don\u2019t make sense and then cause you to make really bad short-term decisions for the business to bring in revenue when it\u2019s not going to help in the long-term. There are bunch of examples I can give here and I don\u2019t want to pick on any one individual company. That said, let me pick on one company. Tim Ferriss: When people are like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an asshole, but,\u201d that usually means they\u2019re immediately going to be an asshole. Kevin Rose: I know. There\u2019s that great Onion article that says the devil\u2019s advocate turns out to be just a big asshole. I love that article. It\u2019s so true. Tim Ferriss: Side note \u2013 I heard this comedian say, \u201cWhen someone says, \u2018I\u2019m a taxpayer,\u2019 it means they\u2019re about to be an asshole.\u201d Kevin Rose: Totally. A great example of this is a company like Fab.com. I was an angel investor there. It had a great founder and a great seed of an idea \u2013 it was a great pivot from the site they were before into a very design-oriented e-commerce play. It had a great following and was doing \u2013 the conversions on these little flash tails were working quite well. They went out and raised several monster rounds, hired a bunch of employees, and just spent into this business and blew through a bunch of capital. When the novelty wore off, the business went away. That said, growing thoughtfully and in line, in track, and in parallel with your revenue, and being more responsible around that makes a lot of sense. Don\u2019t over raise capital and spend too much cash up front. I think we\u2019re getting better at that as an industry. I think there has been enough fires now that people can see that\u2019s not the wisest way to go. That said, we still see things like Uber and others that are just raising monster amounts of cash. But the good news is that they have real revenue to back it up. I think this was very much a thing when you don\u2019t have the revenue and you\u2019re going and doing this \u2013 it\u2019s a bad decision. Tim Ferriss: Also, if we\u2019re looking at Fab versus Uber, the Fab example is very different in the respect that it\u2019s not necessarily a winner take all market where they have to dominate a city or a country or a continent to become the de facto choice for ridesharing. There are certain network effects, or marketplace dynamics, where if they have the most drivers then they\u2019ll have the most riders. The riders want to have the fastest pick-up time. If they have the most riders, then they\u2019ll be able to recruit the most drivers. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle for the person who owns the most market share on both sides of that equation. But in a Fab case, or many cases like it, there are a lot of perverse incentives at play. There are particularly perverse incentives at play in an environment like we are either just coming out of or still in. There are many people who would disagree with this, and I don\u2019t have issues with smaller examples. But there are startups that are on their way to failure and the founders know. They take a ton off the table, the employees see nothing, and then it just craters. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: That is a byproduct of being able to raise these monster rounds, in part \u2013 riding momentum of I-bonds as opposed to revenue. That\u2019s one of the reasons I got dismayed and disillusioned with a lot of the exchanges. They\u2019re certainly not long-term relationship building, but a lot of the transactional exchanges that happens in that startup eco system \u2013 Kevin Rose: There are a lot of positives to taking venture capital. One of the negatives is that the founders are pushed to build a bigger and bigger business. For example, when I first launched Digg, I launched it as just a tech only news site. It quickly became the largest tech news site in the world. There was no doubt we had more traffic than any \u2013 at the time, CNET was big and a couple of other blogs. But when a certain amount of dollars came to the table, it was like, \u201cHey, what we love what you\u2019re doing with Digg as a tech site. Why don\u2019t you go into world news and politics and science and all of these other categories?\u201d So we did that. And then that was great and we had 38 million people a month coming to our site. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could get to 50-100 million people coming to your site per month? Why don\u2019t expand into something that my mom would like to use and embrace some of the traditional news sites and help them promote their content?\u201d Things that just weren\u2019t naturally organic in our DNA \u2013 that is the danger. If Fab had stayed small or Digg had stayed small and focused on their core and stayed true to their DNA, they wouldn\u2019t be forced to make these unnatural decisions that eventually lead them not servicing their audience. Tim Ferriss: In fairness, though \u2013 I\u2019ll play devil\u2019s advocate/asshole here. If you sign up for taking venture capital, you have to understand the economics of venture capital. They need you to grow. They, in turn, have their bosses who are the LPs with a fiduciary responsibility to try to generate a 10x or 100x return for a few startups. The rest are going to be dogs, dead, or zombies. Kevin Rose: And I think that\u2019s where, as Kevin the 25-year-old founder versus where I am today, the difference is that the 25-year-old Kevin would\u2019ve taken that as gospel. \u201cHey, you should go do X, Y, and Z.\u201d \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to go do that. That sounds great. You guys have been down this road before.\u201d The Kevin today would say, \u201cThank you very much, trusted advisor,\u201d and take that into consideration. Oftentimes it is great advice. Eight times out of ten you\u2019re going to agree with them. But there\u2019s that couple of times when you\u2019re going to say, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense for my business. I respect you and your idea, but we\u2019re not going to do that. It\u2019s just not.\u201d And they can\u2019t force your hand in that unless they have control of the board, in which case that\u2019s a whole separate conversation. Alright. I have two more questions for you. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s do it. Kevin Rose: Biggest misconception people have about you. Tim Ferriss: That I have an issue with hard work. I don\u2019t have an issue with hard work. I have an issue with hard work applied to stupid things. You should focus on being effective, picking the right things to do before you focus on being efficient, which is doing things well. Kevin Rose: Do you really only work four hours a week? Tim Ferriss: Oh god. Here\u2019s the reality, and you know this. I know you\u2019re verbally fucking tickling my balls to make me uncomfortable. The fact is, I don\u2019t have to work at all if I don\u2019t want to work. That is not the driver for me at this point in my life. Kevin Rose: I was just joking. You don\u2019t have to answer this question. Tim Ferriss: Oh goddammit. I\u2019m not allowed to have booze right now. I could use some booze, but I\u2019m not gonna do it for reasons I can\u2019t discuss. Top secret. Continue. Kevin Rose: Okay, next question. This is a very serious question. I think other people out there will be curious about this. Tim Ferriss: The rumors about by 21-inch cock are all true. Kevin Rose: There you go. Tim Ferriss: I can\u2019t even blame it on the booze. I haven\u2019t had any. Kevin Rose: You\u2019re 39. Tim Ferriss: 39 \u2013 dirty old man. No, I\u2019m 38. Kevin Rose: Sorry, I\u2019m one year behind. Tim Ferriss: Early onset Alzheimer\u2019s. Kevin Rose: So you\u2019re not married yet. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not. Kevin Rose: I\u2019ve known you for quite a while now and I\u2019ve seen you through a handful of relationships. For those that don\u2019t know you, what do you look for in a woman and what\u2019s your take on dating? I\u2019m curious. Who dates Time Ferriss? What do you look for? Tim Ferriss: Masochistic, ill-advised women. That\u2019s not true. I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m looking for a half-Japanese, half-Italian, bisexual \u2013 Kevin Rose: Be serious. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 architect, super athlete, part time swimsuit model? Kevin Rose: You\u2019re not joking, either. That\u2019s the funny part. I know you well enough to know you\u2019re joking for the podcast but you\u2019re really not joking. Tim Ferriss: Who knows how to squat with the least body weight. Kevin Rose: This is actually what you\u2019re looking for. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll put it this way. I wouldn\u2019t mind that. That sounds like a very enjoyable conversation. I look for generally what I look for in a human being. Kevin Rose: Do you want someone who can kick your ass, though? You\u2019re a hardcore person. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I\u2019m hardcore. Kevin Rose: I\u2019d say of all my friends, you are \u2013 even though you can relax and meditate, you\u2019re very into shit and take stuff very seriously. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I\u2019m hardcore about a lot of things. I can be hard around the edges. These are characteristics that I don\u2019t know if I could fix and I\u2019m not sure I want to fix them. I\u2019ve seen so many benefits from them. They\u2019ve been useful tools. I will tell you I\u2019ve dated women who are very, very feminine and yen \u2013 very swirling in emotional range and very nurturing. I\u2019ve also dated women who are extremely tough and make me want to be more resilient, less reactive, hyper driven. Both of those can work for me. It\u2019s important that you can have someone who is driven and tough like that who doesn\u2019t feel the need to constantly butt heads to assert being an alpha. That is something I can\u2019t have in a relationship because I\u2019m already that way. You can\u2019t have two of those in one room. It\u2019s like Chinese fighting fish. You put them in a bowl and they just fucking kill each other. That dynamic doesn\u2019t work. Whether it\u2019s a heterosexual, homosexual, or whatever-sexual relationship, there has to be a compliment of personality traits and strengths and weaknesses. I could go down a long list. What do you want me to focus on? Kevin Rose: I\u2019m just curious what it is you\u2019re looking for now. We don\u2019t have to go \u2013 what\u2019s that? Yeah, that was a good answer. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll be honest. There is a big part of me \u2013 I, not too long ago, got out of a very long, very serious, fantastic relationship that I reflect on a lot. But ultimately, I wasn\u2019t sure what I was looking for in my life as it relates to family and/or marriage. That led to a level of indecision that was unfair to my partner at the time. When you ask me what I\u2019m looking for, part of me wants to say I don\u2019t know. I know what I can\u2019t stand. I can tell you that. But what I might look for in a person that I\u2019m envisioning as the mother of several kids of mine is very different from what I envision say if I\u2019m considering that my life might be a combination of different women or \u2013 Kevin Rose: Oh shit. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 a lack of marriage entirely. But having say \u2013 maybe I have a wife and then a mistress and they both know each other. Maybe I have two wives. Maybe I have a Raise the Red Lantern situation with like six wives. Sounds like a huge headache on a lot of levels to me personally. Maybe it\u2019s a series of very intimate lovers that I stay in touch with. I don\u2019t know, honestly. It\u2019s a big question mark to me. For the time being, I\u2019m spending time with people \u2013 and this includes women \u2013 who I respect a lot. So whether they are super hardcore and driven or just very good at what they do, but extremely soft and able to counterbalance some of my hard edged, steely attributes \u2013 which can be really damaging in excess. I need someone to help temper that. I respect them because they\u2019re good at what they\u2019re do. I enjoy spending time with them because I learn from them. They don\u2019t take themselves too seriously. They can laugh at themselves. They take care of themselves physically. For most of my friends, that\u2019s a criterion as well. I want to be averaged up in all ways possible by the people I surround myself with. Even if I have some friends who might not take care of themselves physically, I need at least a few close friends who do. Because if I\u2019m the average of the five people I associate with most, well shit. I need to be very careful about how I allocate those interactions. I like really nice hamstrings. I like big brown eyes and little brown ankles, as one friend would put it. Kevin Rose: Little brown ankles? Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s how he describes the type of woman he likes. I like generally long hair, but I can think of an exception to all of these things. That\u2019s the thing. People are like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your type?\u201d Super hot, smart, and funny? I don\u2019t know. Color doesn\u2019t matter to me. In terms of short hair versus long hair \u2013 nah. Tattoos or no tattoos or piercings or no piercings \u2013 I\u2019ve dated every possible permutation of those. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I love women, period. I\u2019m not sure what to do about that. I think that\u2019s part of the challenge that I\u2019m having. Kevin Rose: That was a great answer. Tim Ferriss: I think that\u2019s all we got. Well, how should we close out? Do you have any parting thoughts, recommendations, reflections? Kevin Rose: Yes, I do. Sign up for my newsletter, thejournal.email, on the Internet. I send out a once a month newsletter of all my crazy chaotic stuff, gear, and tech stuff I\u2019m checking out. That also has a podcast on iTunes. And also, I think virtual reality sucks. I tried the HTC and it\u2019s stupid. Tim Ferriss: I think you\u2019re going to lose this bet. Kevin Rose: You sent out a Tweet saying, \u201cVirtual reality is blowing my mind. I now see the light.\u201d I saw that Tweet from you three months ago. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I don\u2019t take it back. I stand by it. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s so dumb. Virtual reality\u2019s so dumb. Tim Ferriss: Alright. Kevin Rose: Did you try the HTC-1 that you put on your head? Tim Ferriss: I tried the Vive with \u2013 Kevin Rose: The Vive, yeah. That\u2019s the one. Tim Ferriss: I think it was the Valve with \u2013 Kevin Rose: At Adam\u2019s lab? Tim Ferriss: No, a different lab. It had Valve software running on it. Kevin Rose: If you were really that blown away \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I was very impressed. Maybe I have better long-term vision than you do. Maybe I can see the potential. Kevin Rose: No. No, this is one of those things where it\u2019s a hype cycle in Silicon Valley. Sadly, the benefit to the consumer has to be in the order of magnitude better than what they\u2019re already experiencing for it to ever get adopted. That comes on a couple of fronts \u2013 on the application front. They have to enjoy it at least 10x or greater. And then it also comes on the comfort and wearability and maintenance and set-up and everything else that goes with owning a virtual reality system. And sadly, we\u2019re all going to realize that it\u2019s much like the Wii. It was fun for the first five games of Wii bowling that I played, but then it ends up in a drawer. Just like 3D TV. Tim Ferriss: Well, here\u2019s what I think you\u2019re missing. Darya\u2019s giving the hands-up, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about \u2013 here\u2019s the difference if we\u2019re looking at purely the entertainment applications restricted to video games. The Wii required entirely new types of games to be created, which basically were reminiscent of early Nintendo sports games. They\u2019re very different from the games that are currently blockbusters. But what if you take virtual reality, and simply use that to enhance the most popular first-person shooter games and Call of Duty and so forth \u2013 which I don\u2019t think is that much of a stretch. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a hard sell. I think that is substantially better than what is currently available. Kevin Rose: We\u2019ll see. I think it\u2019s a pretty \u2013 I would say there\u2019s a couple of different camps in the virtual reality space. There\u2019s one that thinks it\u2019s going to be accessory for gaming and the other one that says we\u2019re going to be watching movies like that and sit around watching the Super Bowl. Everyone will have one at a Super Bowl party. We\u2019re wearing headsets and trying to cram freaking nachos underneath the mask. That\u2019s a real thing. People are saying that kind of stuff. I believe the maintenance and set up is just really difficult. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t see the Super Bowl soon. I don\u2019t see that type of interaction happening. You\u2019re sacrificing an element. We could all watch the fricking Super Bowl at home by ourselves. But we go to a Super Bowl party. Why? There\u2019s a communal aspect to it and elements of that experience that are not fully accounted for when someone brings up the example of the Super Bowl party and using it so you can stand in the middle of the field and have a fucking crazy 300-pound guy charge at you. That sounds like fun. Maybe there are permutations on that that could work, but with something like Call of Duty, where you\u2019re sitting in your basement in your underwear playing it anyway, I think \u2013 in that case, let\u2019s say it is a hype cycle. What does the landscape of VR look like in three years or five years? Has this been abandoned? Kevin Rose: Obviously, a lot of money is going into game development and app development in VR \u2013 tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars from some of the top companies. But it\u2019s one of those things where, if consumers don\u2019t demand this hardware and it doesn\u2019t sell through, then those funds are going to quickly dry up. It\u2019s very much a chicken and egg thing. You need original content, and original experiences, more so than just a flying whale coming by your head that\u2019s in a 30-second demo. You need real content that\u2019s developed for VR, which is expensive to create. It\u2019s a chicken and egg thing, but you need a hell of a lot of eggs. You need a lot of great games. If you get in there and have a mediocre experience or, \u201cI only have two headsets. We can\u2019t play co-op,\u201d there\u2019s 1,000 use cases I could describe where it ends up frustrating the gamer and it sits in the corner and they go back to the way things were. This has been tried time and time again. This isn\u2019t the first type of \u2013 I had a Nintendo Power Glove back in the day. I put my hand in the glove and I tried to do different things with it. Do you remember that thing with the little keyboard on the side of it? Tim Ferriss: I do remember it. Kevin Rose: We\u2019ve tried these devices to augment our gaming experiences and yet we all still come back to the standard controller. It\u2019s easy. I can toss you one. We can sit there and drink a beer while we\u2019re doing it. There\u2019s a thousand little things you can do that you can\u2019t do with these big-ass headsets on. And you need a dedicated room if you\u2019re going to walk around with them. You\u2019d be bumping into furniture and shit. There are so many hurdles to get over here. I just think those hurdles are a little too high. I will say one thing. Augmented reality is very much different than virtual reality, and that I still think the jury\u2019s out. I\u2019m talking about where you put on a pair of glasses that allow you to project \u2013 at least back into your eye \u2013 the idea of there being little living creatures and different things crawling around in your furniture. Have you seen some of those things? Tim Ferriss: I have. They scare the shit out of me. Kevin Rose: That is cool enough. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not just that. It\u2019s like overlaying things onto reality as you visually experience it today. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. That I haven\u2019t written off yet. But this idea of virtual reality \u2013 and I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019m wrong if two years from now this is not the case. But I just had this gut feeling. Sometimes I like to be a little bit different than everybody else. Tim Ferriss: Stir the pot. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You have a bet riding on this, do you not? Kevin Rose: On virtual reality failing? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Don\u2019t you have a \u2013 Kevin Rose: Oh, Adam, yeah. I\u2019m betting a neuroscience friend of ours \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Very well-known neuroscientist. Kevin Rose: He\u2019s on your podcast. Tim Ferriss: Adam Gazzaley. Kevin Rose: He has drunk the Kool-Aid. He\u2019s poured the Kool-Aid into the water, mixed it, and drank it. He\u2019s hardcore. Tim Ferriss: Just as context, Darya used to work with Adam. Is it fair to say he\u2019s one of the preeminent neuroscientists in the world? MD, PhD, studies gaming, has developed gaming, has a lab at UCSF \u2013 one of the best regarded in the country, certainly. Kevin Rose: What does that \u2013 Tim Ferriss: 50 people? Something like that. This isn\u2019t like a homeless guy on the corner with a sandwich board saying VR is coming. You have a qualified opponent. Kevin Rose: No, I get that. I think that he is a good opponent. He is not a technologist. He\u2019s a neuroscientist. He has a dedicated big-ass room for virtual reality. So when he goes and plays in virtual reality \u2013 and I\u2019ve been in his lab and played with his equipment \u2013 it is quite fun. But he has a big-ass room that he gets to \u2013 not everyone has that room. I don\u2019t have that room here in New York. It\u2019s a different environment when \u2013 Tim Ferriss: How specific are your criteria for success of failure? For me \u2013 Kevin Rose: It\u2019s very loose. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 if there are fucking rooms all over a given city, and then in every city, where people can go experience virtual reality, that seems like it\u2019s at least gaining a foothold. That would be some measure of success. Kevin Rose: I think that virtual reality as a form of laser tag could be really interesting. I actually saw that a week ago and it looked pretty fascinating. It had 10 people in a room that were all wearing headsets. They could see each other in the virtual world. Monsters could appear and they could run around corners and shoot them and things like that. But that\u2019s just Scandia fun. That\u2019s like mini golf. That\u2019s going to be a \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Scandia? Kevin Rose: Scandia\u2019s a thing on the West Coast. It\u2019s a mini golf course where you go ride go carts and play mini golf. That\u2019s the kind of fun that is. I think that what Adam\u2019s talking about is this in almost every home and it being a fixture of your household. Tim Ferriss: See, I think you\u2019re overweighting the entire room experience, which is definitely an enhancement and improvement over the stationary experience. But I could see people with immersive sound systems in the headsets themselves so you have surround sound, using the headset in conjunction with a controller, and having an incredible virtual reality experience. Kevin Rose: We\u2019ll see, dude. I\u2019ll tell you a story that I probably shouldn\u2019t tell. I was at Google and I went to Google X, which is very limited access. They do all of the crazy and top secret experiments. They had Google Glass before they announced it. I somehow talked the Glass team into giving me one of the first prototypes outside of the team. So I got one of the first 10 units. It had the beta software on it and I had it hooked up to my Android phone. I could see all of my text notifications. It was the coolest thing if you were in Silicon Valley to have back then. No one had one. I wore it to a party one time and it was stupid. Tim Ferriss: I remember. A friend of ours showed up at South by Southwest with Google Glass on and it was just a nerd magnet. Throngs of people were surrounding her everywhere she went. Kevin Rose: As my wife will tell you, I had mine for two weeks or something like that. I gave it back to the Glass team. They were like, \u201cWhat the fuck? Everybody wants one of these. Why are you turning this in?\u201d They expected me to have it for the next three months. I\u2019m just like, \u201cNo one is going to use this. It\u2019s too dorky. It\u2019s another thing I have to charge. We don\u2019t need more of those in our lives. It\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s bulky.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand it and that was my gut, consumer, product person\u2019s take on it. I ended up just abandoning it. I feel the same way about virtual reality. Tim Ferriss: Only time will tell. I don\u2019t think it will take that much time, either. I think there is so many big announcements and launches coming up soon. Within the next year or 18 months, we should have a pretty good idea of what\u2019s going to fly or not fly. What\u2019s at stake? Kevin Rose: It requires a trip to Japan to buy a bottle of Hibiki 30-year aged whiskey, which you can\u2019t find in the United States. They don\u2019t import it into the United States. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good bet. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s a good bet. It\u2019s a win/win because I\u2019m going to help him drink some of it if I have to give it to him. It should be fun. I think that, even if I lose the bet, I\u2019ll be pretty impressed and happy. If they come out with a few titles where I\u2019m just blown away, I\u2019ll be the first to say this is going to take off. But my gut doesn\u2019t tell me so. Tim Ferriss: The jury\u2019s out. Kevin Rose: We\u2019ll see. Tim Ferriss: Well, another Random Show on the books. You already mentioned the Journal. I will tell people. Check out the t-shirts. I\u2019ve never done t-shirts before. 100 percent of the proceeds are going to psychedelic research, most likely psilocybin, at top universities. I\u2019m not making anything from it whatsoever. Everything is going to senior scientists who are working on very fascinating applications of compounds that have been neglected. They can potentially address some extremely debilitating conditions that have very few options otherwise medically speaking. Check out the shirts. If you like them \u2013 Kevin Rose: American Apparel shirts? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll have to look. I went through \u2013 Kevin Rose: Is it cotton or a blend? Tim Ferriss: Most likely a blend. I went through all of my own t-shirts and picked out the most comfortable and the designs that I liked and sat down with a sourcing team and looked at how to make the most comfortable shirts possible. I\u2019m test driving the prototypes. Kevin Rose: They\u2019re not made from mushrooms? Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re not made from mushrooms. They don\u2019t disintegrate. You don\u2019t take a shower with them and sprout anything. You can\u2019t grind them up and eat them. That would be pretty amazing, but no. Fourhourworkweek.com/mushroom. Check them out. Find us on Twitter if you have anything to correct, say, or add. And I feel like that\u2019s about it. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s it. Thanks for listening. Tim Ferriss: Alright, thanks for listening, guys. You can find show notes, links to various things that we have mentioned, at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, as well as show notes for every other episode. Until next time. See you.

so", "ultimately, this is a ringing endorsement of the benefits of tm, probably", "but there is some weird stuff", "let\u2019s call a spade a spade", "and people have talked about it before", "yeah", "basically, you go into a little room", "swing a dead cat over your head 13 times", "no, you don\u2019t do that", "i\u2019m kidding", "you do your little ritual sacrifice thing", "it\u2019s fine", "i gave fruit", "it lasts like 30 seconds", "and then they give you a mantra", "for people that don\u2019t know, there are a few different types of meditation", "the type that i\u2019m used to is the head space variety, which is mindfulness", "you sit there, you follow your breath, and your attention is directed at the in and out flow of your breath", "that\u2019s kind of it", "mantra based meditation is taking a word that doesn\u2019t mean anything and you repeat it over and over and over in your head", "you sit there for 20 minutes and you take this word \u2013 let\u2019s say it\u2019s cheeseburger \u2013 and you just think cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger over and over", "eventually, you enter this somewhat hypnotic state", "did you find that\u2019s where it took you as well", "it does", "or it can, i should say", "i\u2019m sure there are people who are experts in this who would take issue with this analogy, but you can think of it as almost a white noise machine for a waking state", "so if you use a white noise machine to help you get to sleep, then this would be the equivalent for helping you achieve a sort of alpha brainwave level of relaxed attentiveness that some people might associate with flow", "so it does help you get into a hypnotic state", "that\u2019s right", "where i find it very helpful is, if you feel compelled when you\u2019ve attempted meditation in the past to swat your thoughts away as if they were flies buzzing in your face, it can get very frustrating", "by repeating a mantra, you\u2019re effectively overriding a lot of the internal dialogue or monologue", "but yes, you can get into a very, very altered state of sorts \u2013 an enhanced state", "yes", "it\u2019s a four-day training course and i did the first day", "it was literally the fruit sacrifice and then the introduction of the mantra", "by the way, the reason i said it\u2019s cheeseburger, cheeseburger is because they give you this mantra and you\u2019re not allowed to tell it to anyone", "it\u2019s private, just for you", "later, i looked them up online and there are 15 of them", "so you can just guess which one mine is", "it starts with an \u201cm.\u201d i\u2019m just kidding", "essentially, you do that, and then i was a little upset", "i finished day one and i was like, \u201cwhy did i really pay all of this money for this?\u201d why do i have to say puttentang, puttentang", "i literally read it on the internet and i could just do it", "i was like, \u201cyou know what", "let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt.\u201d i went back for day two and it all made sense and i stayed for the entire four days", "it\u2019s not \u2013 to be clear, when you say four days, it\u2019s like an hour or two a day", "yeah", "i\u2019m talking about an hour and a half per day", "day two through four is all about helping you get over the little hurdles that appear throughout the entire process", "it sounds simple, but as you\u2019re doing the mantra certain things happen", "i was doing the mantra and i started syncing the mantra with my heartbeat", "i was like, \u201cwhoa, that\u2019s weird.\u201d so that distracted me and took me away from the mantra", "i didn\u2019t know what to do and was kind of frozen", "imagine that, but probably 15 different things you will run into that are distractions", "they teach you how to come back to the mantra, embrace that stuff, and that\u2019s where the value is", "it\u2019s practical, tactical stuff, where there were two chief benefits \u2013 at least for me", "you have someone holding you accountable to meditate for two sessions in between the inverse and meetings", "there is a consequence (i.e", "embarrassment) to not performing the assigned work", "when i tried meditation in the past, i\u2019d buy a book and i\u2019d be like, \u201c90 percent of this makes no sense", "i don\u2019t understand", "but here\u2019s a little sidebar", "fine, i\u2019ll follow my breath.\u201d i\u2019d do it and i\u2019d be like, \u201cam i doing this right", "i don\u2019t know", "i had all of these thoughts", "i\u2019m no good at this", "i\u2019m losing at meditation", "i quit.\u201d right", "and after a few days, i would stop doing it", "but when you have someone you\u2019re going to meet with each day who, in that hour and a half, is going to want to talk about your last two sessions, do post game analysis, and help you with the issues that came up, you feel compelled with social pressure of sorts", "yeah, it was great", "and the costs, quite frankly", "if i were to point to a benefit of the payment \u2013 although i hesitate to do that \u2013 you succumb to the sunk cost fallacy", "you\u2019re like, \u201cwell, i already paid for it, i might as well do it.\u201d yeah", "and i asked a ton of questions and got a lot of value out of it", "it\u2019s been about a month and a half now", "i\u2019ve been practicing and doing 40 minutes of meditation every day, seven days a week", "two sessions, split into 20 minutes", "yes", "my wife, darya says she notices a big difference", "i don\u2019t know", "i feel a little bit more relaxed", "my pressure points are if too much is going on in my life \u2013 if i have a lot of travel combined with work combined with board meetings combined with fundraising \u2013 i hit a certain critical mass and i break down a little bit", "it\u2019s just too much going on", "why are you laughing", "i\u2019m laughing because it just doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else", "i don\u2019t know why you have this particular defect", "i\u2019m joking", "i missed you, too", "but seriously, that hasn\u2019t happened as much", "i\u2019ve been able to weather the storm a lot better", "i\u2019m not experiencing any type of effect other than i will do the meditation and i will come out of it in a slight daze", "they tell you when you finish the 20-minute session to spend three minutes slowly reintroducing yourself to the world", "it\u2019s like coming up from scuba diving", "you have to equalize", "exactly", "one time i didn\u2019t have that three minutes and i just got up and went, and i felt a little weird afterwards", "the lady who was instructing me said, \u201cactually, if that\u2019s going to happen and you know you have to go out to some place, cut back the meditation time and still spend that three minutes.\u201d you go pretty deep inside yourself and you\u2019re a little dazed", "people can get headaches and all kinds of things if they come out too fast", "darya is pointing to a shirt that she had printed for herself that says, \u201cthat\u2019s what she said.\u201d and that\u2019s why i married my wife", "she makes those kinds of jokes", "let\u2019s make it more concrete", "we were just at dinner together and darya said you have been a rock in the best way possible, meaning very stable \u2013 a dramatic difference", "for someone who is doing that type of work, it can be in some cases difficult to discern the progress", "it\u2019s like if you\u2019re gaining half a pound of fat a month", "a decade later, you\u2019re going to be pretty fat", "but you won\u2019t notice it \u2013 like a year later, you\u2019d be pretty fat, too", "that also", "it\u2019s a terrible comparison, like the boiling frog, but you don\u2019t notice the improvement because you\u2019re exposed to it every day", "right", "and i noticed a big change in my sleep", "particularly the onset of sleep changed dramatically", "i will be the first to admit i am not as consistent with afternoon sessions, so for me it\u2019s mostly first thing in the morning", "this particular type of meditation is probably not for everyone, but it can be very useful for some people", "i think the social accountability, the camaraderie, and the teacher/student relationship were what was most important for me", "yeah", "i do like the foundation they put in place", "once you pay for the session \u2013 do you remember how much it was", "$1,200.00 or something like that", "something like that", "the cost has decreased over time from $1,500.00 to $1,200.00", "but you get to go back whenever you want", "the teacher was like, \u201ccome back any time", "you don\u2019t have to pay anything to hang out and i\u2019ll help you if you run into any more road blocks.\u201d they were really friendly people", "let me give a couple of suggestions", "the tm folks will probably hate me for this, but you can experiment with this using some type of mantra", "i hate that term", "i think it\u2019s very loaded", "but you can use a word that is a two-syllable word, like nature", "well, it\u2019s not supposed to mean anything, though", "it\u2019s not supposed to mean anything, but let\u2019s not let perfect be the enemy \u2013 ohm is a very common mantra", "you can use ohm also", "for some people who are allergic to yoga like i was for a long time, they\u2019ll have negative associations", "but you can use that", "even though i do have a mantra, i\u2019ve used that exact example of nature", "what does your mantra start with", "i am not going to tell you", "you can say the letter it starts with", "i\u2019m going to lie to you", "it starts with \u201cz.\u201d i\u2019m such a hyper analytical person, i enjoy having a few superstitions i hold on to", "you drank the kool-aid", "you totally drank the kool-aid", "no, i also don\u2019t like using red pens for signing anything", "are you serious", "who even has a red pen", "yeah, i won\u2019t use red pens", "i don\u2019t like cheersing with water", "i don\u2019t like cheersing with water, either", "that\u2019s just weird", "i\u2019m not doing it for a superstition reason", "it just feels strange", "so a couple of alternatives for people \u2013 darya: [inaudible \u2013 no mic] no, i\u2019m not", "she was saying i\u2019m doing it for superstitious reasons", "i just don\u2019t like the idea of everyone drinking alcohol and i don\u2019t have a glass of alcohol", "no, it\u2019s not superstition", "it\u2019s pure hard science", "i like alcohol", "i want a glass of alcohol", "okay, we won\u2019t belabor that", "but for people who are interested in experimenting with this kind of thing, you can bootleg an imperfect variation of it and experiment", "i do think people would derive benefit from it", "but having someone who can answer very specific questions like, \u201cyou travel a lot", "what are you going to do if room service knocks on the door and comes in while you\u2019re in the middle of meditation?\u201d going through all of those contingencies is very valuable", "but you pointed out one \u2013 headspace has worked tremendously well for a lot of my friends and a lot of people listening to this for that matter", "calm is another one that has worked well", "there are others who have enjoyed \u2013 and i\u2019ve enjoyed, frankly", "i\u2019m not a purist about it", "i\u2019ve used guided meditations from tara brach, who was introduced to me by maria popova of brain pickings", "the guided meditations by tara brach are fantastic", "she\u2019s also been on the podcast", "sam harris has some great guided meditations", "i think the website is samharris.org", "there are many options out there for starting your day off in a relaxed, nonreactive, calmly effective state", "and those are some of the options", "yeah", "i agree with you", "i would say if you\u2019re going to try mantra based meditation, try to pair up with a friend or someone you know who has done it before", "they can help you get over those hurdles", "the nice thing about paying for the class is that it truly is a forcing function to make you take it seriously", "i went to day two because i was kind of pissed", "i was like, \u201cwhy did i pay this much for it", "i\u2019m going to get something out of it.\u201d after i went i actually got it", "this is the way with all courses", "it\u2019s true with a lot of skills, also, that are very frustrating in the beginning", "let\u2019s take slacklining as an example", "oh god", "i tried that at your house", "slacklining is difficult, and most people completely lose interest and quit after the first and second sessions", "neurologically, they\u2019re not capable of the neurological and muscular control and coordination", "you need a certain \u2013 you saw me", "it was like i was having seizures", "yeah, so you require a certain number of sleep cycles, as far as i can tell, to consolidate this procedural knowledge", "meditation, in this particular case, is very similar", "it\u2019s like going out and snowboarding", "i don\u2019t know anyone on the first day of snowboarding who was like, \u201cthat was so much fun.\u201d you just eat shit and catch edges and smash your head on the slopes \u2013 or your ass and tailbone \u2013 for the entire time", "right", "in the world of meditation, that\u2019s where 95-plus percent of people quit", "if they were forced to do five days, they would see the potential", "they would have one good run and they would be like, \u201cokay, now i\u2019m hooked.\u201d that\u2019s why i like to take 10 from head space, where they take 10 days for 10 minutes a day", "that was the first time i got through all 10 days and i was like, \u201coh.\u201d it was about day eight when i got it", "i was coming out of it more relaxed", "i was feeling stronger as an individual after i did", "anyway, we don\u2019t have to talk about meditation the entire time", "the last thing i would say is it\u2019s very similar to physical training for non-reactivity", "if have been interested in the stoic philosophical episodes that have been on this podcast before related to seneca and a number of episodes by ryan holiday", "training that type of non-reactivity \u2013 meditation or mindfulness \u2013 mentally as you would train physically is a foundational skill that allows all the other pieces of the puzzle to function well", "alright, what\u2019s next", "that was mine", "what\u2019s yours", "i\u2019ll give a couple of specifics", "one is a fiction book that i just finished", "i have almost always been a nonfiction snob", "i\u2019ve taken a very hoity toity position with fiction, which was, \u201cif i just want to make stuff up, i can do that myself.\u201d i feel the same way", "i want to get something concrete out of a book", "i don\u2019t want to waste the time", "if i\u2019m going to invest the time reading a book, it needs to be valuable, actionable, and have takeaways", "i\u2019ve realized a few errors in that thinking", "first, just as is the case with movies, there are movies or tv shows for entertainment, for stress relief \u2013 like dumb and dumber, which are brilliant in their own way", "and then there are documentaries, like fog of war, you might watch to learn something", "i think it\u2019s very true with reading", "you can better remember and incorporate some of the lessons from fiction because they are stories well told and we are programmed to be story remembering machines", "the truths that are imbedded in fiction often are more utilitarian than the dense nonfiction that is just going to fall out of your brain like sand through the fingers", "that\u2019s been my experience", "i\u2019ve actually realized that fiction can have not only a rejuvenating and relaxing effect by turning off your problem solving apparatus, but you can actually imbed truths that are helpful", "one book that was recommended by our mutual friend chris sacca", "he\u2019s been on this podcast and is on track to be \u2013 if not already \u2013 the most successful venture capitalist of all time based on his first fund", "the novel is how to get filthy rich in rising asia", "i\u2019m blanking on the author\u2019s name", "it\u2019s a pakistani author", "it\u2019s a fascinating novel that is beautifully written", "i\u2019ve never seen such incredibly glowing reviews of any book", "it\u2019s just woven together in such a powerful way", "it\u2019s unique because of the voice and perspective that is used", "the entire book is written from first person", "it\u2019s like you awake to pain in your left eye", "you\u2019re laying down under your mother\u2019s cot with your head on the dirt", "oh, i like this", "this sounds cool", "i was told about this by chris, who \u2013 it sounds like a video game almost", "it does", "after chris told me about this, i thought to myself, \u201ci should really read that.\u201d my second thought was, \u201cthat way of writing the book will be fascinating and cute for 10 pages and then it\u2019s going to drive me insane.\u201d it didn\u2019t at all", "you just seamlessly become this character", "i don\u2019t want to spoil it, but it\u2019s written as a parody of a self-help book, which is awesome and hilarious", "there is a lot of truth and timeless wisdom imbedded in this book", "is it on audible or just \u2013 oh, i\u2019m sure it is", "thank you, darya", "yeah, there we go", "how to get filthy rich in rising asia by mohsin hamid", "the reason we\u2019re not getting our facts right is i have no internet at the house right now", "darya\u2019s looking things up on her phone", "right", "and here\u2019s the quote in there", "many liked this quote by michiko kakutani with the new york times, \u201caudacious\u2026 hamid reaffirms his place as one of his generation\u2019s most inventive and gifted writers.\u201d it\u2019s a beautifully written book", "if people are looking for a shift in the gears \u2013 perhaps a break from the relentless pursuit of dry facts, then i think this is a fantastic way to spend a few days", "i got so into this, i read this book in maybe three days tops", "i think it was two days, probably", "i read it in a weekend", "it\u2019s fantastic", "so that would be the most recent read that i\u2019m into", "i\u2019ll bring up one other one that\u2019s really weird", "maybe it\u2019s just an odd choice and an impulsive purchase", "it\u2019s a book of poetry", "i\u2019m not a poetry reader and i was in a barnes & noble at union square in new york city", "there was a really thin collection of poetry sitting there called night sky with exit wounds", "i think the author is ocean vuong", "that\u2019s a great title", "it\u2019s fantastic", "oh, that\u2019s what caught me", "i\u2019m pretty sure the last name is vietnamese", "i opened this book that\u2019s very small and i started reading one poem in the morning when i wake up and one at night", "or, if i feel stressed, i use it just like i use fiction to short-circuit the pro/con hyper analytical, what-if brain that can drive me completely bonkers", "it works really well", "i will warn people about something i didn\u2019t know", "i don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve affected my purchase, but this author is very gay and very explicit", "there is some pretty hardcore action in this book", "if you\u2019re reading along and you\u2019re like, \u201cwhoa", "hey now", "\u2013 tim\u2019s into some crazy shit", "that will probably happen a few times", "some of the poems, i don\u2019t like at all, and that\u2019s okay", "but every third or fourth i read \u2013 and this is a first for me \u2013 the wording is so evocative of unusual imagery", "like the night sky with exit wounds \u2013 it twists my brain", "it\u2019s almost like mental yoga", "my brain struggles to piece together an image that makes sense", "a lot of these poems don\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense, but there are four or five turns of phrase that stretch my ability to visualize in such a way that i find it just opens doors to perception or gives me other lenses through which i can view the rest of my day", "sweet", "it sounds odd, i know, but i\u2019ve never really read or pursued poetry in this way", "it was a very impulsive purchase based on chancing across this book", "i think it\u2019s going to reignite my interest in certain types of poetry, like those that were introduced to me by rolf potts, the writer and author of vagabonding, one of my favorite books", "that\u2019s a to be continued", "i don\u2019t think i will become a poet", "i don\u2019t have the hubris to think i have the capacity for that, but also the way this book is formatted is so odd", "as someone who is accustomed to narrative fiction or nonfiction, the words will be scattered around the page for one poem and then the next will be an unbroken paragraph of text with no punctuation", "it\u2019s just so jolting that i find it serves as a pattern interrupt for me", "it\u2019s almost like art, in a way", "totally", "you\u2019re getting a little piece of art on every page", "it absolutely is", "that has been an interesting, unintended experiment of mine recently", "that\u2019s awesome", "another is that i am going to be, as promised, donating at least $100,000 to psychedelic research at top universities this year, 2016", "i\u2019ve already raised $90-something-thousand for johns hopkins and the use of psilocybin for treatment resistant depression", "that\u2019s depression that has not been addressable by any traditional means", "i\u2019m going to be doing more work in funding research", "thank you for everybody who contributed to that campaign", "it was a huge success", "things are already underway", "i\u2019m very excited about what will be discovered that can be used in that trial", "give me the quick 30 seconds for people who aren\u2019t familiar with this", "what is the trial", "what are you testing", "i get that it\u2019s depression that can\u2019t be treated with anything else", "but what does the actual trial look like", "what do they receive", "if people want to read all of the details, they can go to crowdrise.com/timferriss", "the trial has actually been upgraded", "it will be relatively small sample size", "i\u2019m pulling this from memory, but i think it will be six to 12 people", "can i be one of the \u2013 unfortunately, not, unless you want to move to baltimore and fill out a very long questionnaire and qualify for it", "but the purpose is to determine whether a single, or several, administrations of standardize psilocybin \u2013 i\u2019m guessing 0.25 to 0.35 milligrams per kilograms, which would translate to what would generally be considered heroic dose", "if i get this wrong, you can go to my blog and leave a comment and let me know", "we want to see the measurable effects and persistence of effects of psilocybin in patients who have not responded \u2013 chronic depression that has not been addressable or treatable with other pharmaceutical or therapeutic means", "they will be also using fmri and other imaging tools to try to determine if there is a demonstrable and statistically significant effect, how psilocybin has this particular effect", "there is good science and more science on the way to indicate that there are some incredibly powerful applications of psilocybin, for instance in the treatment of different kinds of addiction", "it can\u2019t be used for everything, but in terms of nicotine addiction or alcoholism, it\u2019s tremendously effective \u2013 at least based on the preliminary data we have thus far", "when you\u2019re administering this psilocybin to someone \u2013 can i finish one thing", "yeah, yeah", "go for it", "the purpose of me bringing it up was not to say, \u201chey, guys", "i\u2019m donating a bunch of money to psilocybin", "please give me a gold star.\u201d it was to say that i\u2019m doing a second campaign", "instead of using crowdfunding, i want to run an experiment", "i want to figure out not only what works or doesn\u2019t work in the scientific arena with these compounds, but what are the most effective nontraditional ways of fundraising for scientific studies", "i\u2019ve already designed and will be selling a number of themed t-shirts that should be available by the time you hear this", "you can check those out by going to fourhourworkweek.com/mushroom, which is traditionally where one finds psilocybin", "it\u2019s not in all mushrooms, so don\u2019t go out foraging", "that\u2019s a good way to get dead", "i\u2019m curious to see if merchandising is a more efficient way to raise $100,000 for scientific research than crowdfunding", "in turn, i will compare those to the usual approach, which is a director of development of a university or nonprofit has a dinner at someone\u2019s house where they invite a bunch of muckety-mucks and they have a one-on-one conversations infused with a lot of wine to convince people to donate money", "everyone gives $25,000 and that\u2019s what you hope for", "or you try to land a whale", "i want to see if there are more elegant ways of doing that", "the t-shirt looks pretty cool", "you\u2019re wearing it now and it\u2019s fantastic", "yeah", "it\u2019s very comfortable", "i spent a disturbing amount of time picking out the materials for these shirts", "i\u2019m a real stickler", "i\u2019ve seen some shirts i would\u2019ve been totally down to wear \u2013 from say south by southwest, where every startup is giving away free shirts", "that\u2019s generally a waste of money, by the way", "but some of them are so comfortable that i\u2019ve worn ridiculous shirts just because they\u2019re a good material", "they always give you extra-large, though", "but they give you extra-large muumuu shirts with a 20-by-20-inch logo that makes the front all stick and plastic", "who is going to wear that", "yeah", "you tried to cut corners to make a minimally expensive shirt and as a result you wasted all of it", "you spent $2.00 a shirt \u2013 it\u2019s more like $10.00, but yeah", "you spent $10.00 a shirt", "you did 1,000 shirts because you didn\u2019t want to spend $15,000", "and now that $10,000 is going to be entirely wasted because no one is going to wear it", "you could\u2019ve just spent 50 percent more and actually have some measurable roi of some type", "it\u2019s a pet peeve", "i fucking hate it", "i have no fashion sense", "i wear a lot of t-shirts", "i think a lot of about t-shirt comfort", "i have a question about mushrooms", "yes", "the typical college kevin that has experience with mushrooms is you get a chocolate, you get a bag, or something like that", "when you do these trials, how do they measure this stuff", "are they grinding up mushrooms and weighing them out", "how do they actually administer \u2013 my understanding is that it\u2019s synthesized", "it would be extracted, but this is actually one of the largest constraints, with a compound that is as tracked and regulated as plutonium \u2013 it\u2019s scheduled in the same class as cocaine and heroin", "so it is extremely difficult to get the approvals on many different levels, including irb for human trials, to initiate this type of research", "i need experts here for accuracy, but for the sake of argument, let\u2019s just say you get all of the approvals", "you want to get five grams of psilocybin, it\u2019s something crazy like $15,000 a gram to get a hold of it because there are no economies of scale", "who\u2019s growing it", "it\u2019s not being grown, it\u2019s all synthesized", "synthesized or extracted \u2013 i don\u2019t know specifically", "there is a nonprofit called usona which has purchased a very large quantity so they can then distribute at cost to researchers", "it\u2019s a brilliant approach and they\u2019re doing this all through legitimate, legal means", "they have all the necessary clearances", "it removes the largest constraints currently, which is capital", "universities have fundraising and it has to be allocated", "if you have a six-person study and it\u2019s going to cost an additional $50,000-$100,000, even if all of your research is well planned and all of the proper boxes checked, if you don\u2019t have the money, you don\u2019t have the money", "so this will in part remove that limitation", "it should greatly improve the number of researchers who are performing studies using psilocybin, which is very exciting", "that\u2019s great", "the first time i read about it being used in research was probably about six to eight months ago", "there was a study done in new york", "this kid that was studying to become a doctor came down with cancer and he was having absolutely horrible anxiety", "he knew how to check himself because he was premed", "he was rubbing his lymph nodes all the time and freaking out, to the point where the doctors were like, \u201cyou need to stop rubbing your lymph nodes.\u201d he was causing rashes", "he went off the deep end", "they had this study and he took part", "he swallowed these capsules of psilocybin and knocked out his anxiety 100 percent", "even though he still had stage four cancer, he was just okay with dying at that point", "this is one of the areas that is very active", "it\u2019s end of life anxiety or depression for, in instance, terminal cancer patients", "there is a very good article written some time ago by michael pollan called the trip treatment", "it was in the new yorker and is very much worth reading", "it talks a good deal about this", "that is one type of study that i will be funding more of", "there are actually two on deck", "it is very important to fund studies that are easily defended at this nascent stage of research, with a very unfairly scheduled compound", "you have to really be on the up and up and on the best behavior, and have as many assurances and insurances as possible, to ensure you can defend this study scientifically and politically", "these particular populations in the early stages are important to choose wisely", "it\u2019s very hard to say, \u201cfuck the cancer patient who\u2019s going to die", "let that guy have incredible anxiety and depression.\u201d it\u2019s very hard to attack that", "similarly, i find it very compelling to look at the treatment resistant depression, something that has not responded to other medical options to date, or veterans with ptsd", "don\u2019t you feel like you could use marijuana as a template here", "they\u2019ve been very successful at creating cannabis related compounds to treat and help cancer patients with pain and other things", "that was kind of the foot in the door strategy to open the door to further research other things", "potentially", "i\u2019ve spoken with some people who have had very deep involvement on the political legislative side with cannabis", "i do think there are lessons to be learned \u2013 both things to do and not to do", "so that\u2019s something i\u2019ve continued to be very passionate about", "sweet", "if you want some super comfy t-shirts that\u2019ll make your nipples hard in a good way, go to fourhourworkweek.com/mushroom", "one is very subtle", "one is not so subtle", "you can decide if you want to support some team colors", "all of the proceeds, 100 percent, are going to directly to research", "that is something i\u2019m very much looking forward", "awesome", "i have one quick little book and then we can move into the q&a", "does that sound good", "let\u2019s do it", "the book i\u2019m halfway through right now \u2013 and i hate to recommend something i\u2019m only halfway through, but i\u2019m really enjoying it", "it\u2019s called moonwalking with einstein", "have you read it", "i haven\u2019t, but i know a good deal about it", "joshua foer", "yes", "he was a writer that was covering national memory champions", "so he was assigned this beat and he thought he was going to write a single article about these memory champions and then he got pulled into actually performing and learning the tricks of the trade to become a memory champion", "now memory champion includes things like memorizing the order of the cards in a shuffled deck", "that\u2019s right", "or an unpublished poem handed to you, and names and faces of 50-some people", "they hand you these cards with names and faces and you get a minute to memorize all of the \u2013 i think digistrings, maybe", "yeah, you use random strings of digits", "it\u2019s insane stuff that for someone like me, who has a really horrible memory, to be attracted to this book", "where i\u2019m at right now, they talk about this idea of a memory palace", "do you know much about this", "i know all about it", "the loci technique", "yeah", "give your take on it", "i\u2019m curious", "i used to be really into this stuff", "also, ed cook, who is the coach in moonwalking with einstein is a very close friend of mine", "no way", "that\u2019s amazing", "he has been on the podcast, talking about memory stuff", "are you serious", "how did i miss that episode", "that\u2019s awesome", "he\u2019s great", "we did it when i was on the west coast and he was in london, so he had plenty of booze", "it was great", "he\u2019s a hilarious brit to start with", "they talk about him drinking in the episode and going out \u2013 oh, it\u2019s not joke", "\u2013 and using it to hit on girls and stuff, by memorizing", "ed is hilarious", "you should definitely check out the episode", "memory palace has been used for ages in one form or another in many different cultures", "it\u2019s also called the loci technique, which means location", "the way it\u2019s used is very simple", "you have a predetermined location or route that you\u2019re familiar with and you can then, in the process of giving yourself a tour of this location in a predetermined say clockwise fashion around the perimeter of the inside of a concert hall, or walking from your front door to your favorite coffee shop where you pass 16 different buildings and a bunch of different landmarks, you can place items that you want to remember along that route in a particular order", "right", "and that allows you to do some very interesting things", "not only can you remember things by using imagery \u2013 which we\u2019re very visual creatures \u2013 you can also recall them out of order", "i used to do this as a party trick in college", "i was a neuroscience major, and for a very brief flash in time, i was very interested in how to stretch the capacity of cognition", "you can take the abstract and convert it into the concrete, ideally in the form of images", "you can do that with numbers", "for instance, you can take the numbers from one to one hundred, convert the numbers zero to nine into specific letters", "so let\u2019s just say zero is \u201cs\u201d or \u201cz.\u201d one is \u201ct\u201d or \u201cd,\u201d which both have one down stroke", "three is \u201cm,\u201d three down strokes", "four is \u201cr,\u201d \u2013 the last letter is r", "and then let\u2019s just say you decide well in advance that 12, as an example, is tn", "anytime you have a 12, it\u2019s automatically tn", "maybe that\u2019s the tin man", "so let\u2019s just say you have a route from your front door to your coffee shop and somebody gives you a one-dollar bill, a five-dollar bill, a ten, and a twenty", "you say, \u201cokay, i\u2019m going to memorize the serial code numbers on all of these and give them back to you", "i would take pairs of numbers and go in fours", "my first stop \u2013 i walk out the door and there\u2019s a yellow fire hydrant", "that\u2019s the first landmark that i pass", "if the first four numbers are like 1270 \u2013 i\u2019m making that up", "seven is a \u201ck\u201d and zero is an \u201cs\u201d or a \u201cz,\u201d like i said", "so 1270", "so tn \u2013 i have tin man", "70 \u2013 kz would be one", "kz i associate with this guy named bill kazmaier, who was the world\u2019s strongest man champion for ages", "he\u2019s a complete beast", "i know what he looks like", "so now i have the tin man and kazmaier fighting around this yellow fire hydrant", "now i have four numbers", "i can move on to the next one", "by doing that, you can get to the point very quickly where you\u2019re memorizing 100-plus random numbers at a time", "it\u2019s really incredible", "so i\u2019ll give you my very first exercise in the book", "it\u2019s the same idea", "this time you picture your childhood house", "everyone tends to know their childhood house pretty well \u2013 or a location you know quite well and have lived there for a long time", "they start you off at the sidewalk right by your mailbox", "so you think you\u2019re going to put an item down right there", "in this case, he wants you to memorize 15 different items on a grocery shopping list", "the first thing is pickled garlic", "so you put a glass of pickled garlic right there, when you\u2019re walking in, right on the corner", "you visualize the glass", "you visualize how it tastes in your mouth, the logo on the outside, the type of screw down cap that it has \u2013 and the more connections you can make to how it feels and how it tastes, the stronger the reinforcement is in your brain", "so that is one location", "so just like you, the next one up is by your garage door or the front door", "the next one is inside the house or in your kitchen or whatever comes next", "you pick these 10 different locations and you place one object down at each location", "sure enough, i can go back days later and tell you exactly where the pickled garlic was", "almost anyone can do this", "if you use the same location over and over and over again, i found there was a fair amount of interference and i would get confused because i would recall something i had already put in this specific place", "if i was sitting in the equivalent of a bar on princeton\u2019s campus hanging out with somebody and they\u2019re like, \u201ci heard you do some weird memory shit.\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cdance for me, monkey.\u201d and i\u2019d be like, \u201cokay.\u201d so i would actually look around the room i was sitting in and i would place the images around the room", "it was so unique a signature and frame that i would see the person two or three days later and i\u2019d be like, \u201chey, do you still have that five in your wallet?\u201d i\u2019d quote the serial code backwards and they\u2019d be like, \u201cwhat?!\u201d people can get to that level of proficiency within a week or two of practice", "it\u2019s not complicated", "anyway, this is a great book", "i\u2019m enjoying it so far", "if you\u2019re looking to improve your memory, there are a bunch of little tricks they\u2019re starting to unveil about halfway through the book", "it\u2019s been a fun read and it\u2019s also on audible", "that\u2019s how i got it", "i\u2019ve heard great things about it", "there is another book for those of you who want a compliment that i found extremely helpful", "i haven\u2019t seen the book in 20 years, but i think the author is higbee", "your memory and how to improve it", "cool", "i\u2019ll check that one out as well", "that is a tremendous resource", "in my sophomore year, all of the recreational reading i did was related to pneumonic devices and studying this type of \u2013 some people call it artificial enhancement of memory", "that is so funny", "i didn\u2019t even know this when i sat down", "you didn\u2019t know i was going to bring this book up", "i had no idea", "there is another book that is just basically a description of a super mind called mind of mnemonist by a.j", "luria", "it talks about synesthesia and all of this crazy, rainman-like abilities and beyond", "i thought it was very inspiring, but it also highlighted that, when you have those types of gifts, it\u2019s often a very mixed bag", "you have a lot of issues", "yeah, they bring that up a lot in this book", "they walk through a couple of profiles of individuals that have had more or less perfect memories", "it\u2019s very daunting not to be able to forget certain things", "it actually has really bad \u2013 you want to be able to forget certain things", "we\u2019re built to forget certain things", "it shows the consequences there, and they\u2019re not pretty", "no, they\u2019re not", "that\u2019s why, when i look at technology and living in silicon valley as i do, and the perspective of memory enhancement using technological means \u2013 i think there is a lot of promise in developing some of these technologies", "they\u2019re well into development at this point", "are you talking about \u2013 [crosstalk] no, i\u2019m not talking about tdcs \u2013 the transcranial direct current stimulation", "that sounds right", "no, i\u2019ve experimented with that", "have you", "i have", "gosh, we could just keep going on and on", "we need to get to q&a", "yeah, we\u2019ll do q&a", "and if you guys want to talk more about cognitive enhancement and memory, we can certainly do that", "we do should do \u2013 [crosstalk] actually, i have another recommendation for people", "have you guys seen black mirror", "no", "oh my god", "i saw black swan", "wait, i did see \u2013 you mean, the little miniseries", "the miniseries that\u2019s like the twilight zone based on technology", "yeah", "the first one was just kind of like \u2013 look, the first one is creepy and gross", "but i really enjoyed it", "there are some very good episodes", "i watched the one where the president\u2019s daughter gets kidnapped or whatever", "yeah, i think that\u2019s the first one", "it\u2019s a mind trip, but there\u2019s one episode about a not-too-distant-future where you can replay memories because your waking reality is being recorded through your eye", "you can replay them, project them for people, rewind, search for certain things \u2013 i don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far away", "that\u2019s crazy", "but it definitely highlights some of the risks involved with that", "it could be amazing, but it also could be really horrible", "i think it will be both", "alright", "q&a", "let\u2019s do it", "you want to take a stab first", "i want to start first", "this is kind of fun", "i get to interview you on your podcast", "i guess the random show is our shared show, but this is more or less your channel", "what is one illegal substance that you\u2019ve tried that has changed you for the better", "got tim tim on this one", "psilocybin", "psilocybin", "that\u2019s your number one", "i had a number of very transformative and formative experiences with psilocybin that were the tipping point for certain decisions and reprogramming", "what did it do for you", "clearly, as mentioned just a few minutes ago with the research you want to do, something happened and it changed you", "what was the change", "i would say i\u2019ve always been a worrier", "i\u2019ve always had a fair degree of anxiety, which is not uncommon among a-type personalities", "this is me to the tee right now", "i heard at one point \u2013 and i want to know the attribution on this, so somebody please let us know", "hit us up on twitter", "@timferriss", "@kevinrose", "this expression i heard and rang so true to me was, \u201canxiety is being trapped in the future and depression is being trapped in the past.\u201d so if you\u2019re a planner and a control freak, what are you doing", "you\u2019re constantly planning", "what if this", "what if that", "contingency a", "contingency b", "it\u2019s makes you a fucking stress case", "dude, that\u2019s me", "and it manifests in different ways", "some people get angry", "some people start losing their temper", "other people develop physical symptoms \u2013 gi discomfort, acid reflux, or whatever it might be", "i\u2019ve had it all big time", "my experience is that sufficient dose \u2013 and this is something you really need to do with proper supervision", "i\u2019m not just saying that as ass covering, liability lip service", "there are many cases of people using psychedelics in the wrong circumstances and dying", "you can make very bad decisions \u2013 step out in front of traffic, jump out of a window", "there are many different ways you can horribly injure or kill yourself if this is not used in a responsible way", "but not from overdosing psilocybin, right", "no, it\u2019s from making very poor decisions because you think you can fly or something", "or drive your car or something stupid", "all terrible ideas", "you need proper supervision", "but with all of those caveats, let\u2019s use a comparison", "i think we\u2019ve all had the experience of opening up a computer and you have 30 tabs open", "you\u2019re running out of storage", "i\u2019m looking at kevin\u2019s computer right now", "it looks just like mine", "you have 30 tabs open \u2013 warning, startup disk almost full", "oh shit", "what do i do", "and then dropbox is syncing", "why is my computer running so slow", "oh, slack\u2019s also on", "it\u2019s like, \u201cwhy is my system so goddamn slow?\u201d oh, the antivirus is on", "you have antivirus on a mac", "i don\u2019t", "for me, a moderate to high dose of psilocybin serves as a hard reboot", "it just cleans that entire system, flushes the cache, and allows me to regain a 30,000-foot view", "sanity in view of larger pictures and my most important priorities \u2013 and remove all of that noise", "the anxiolytics \u2013 the anxiety decreasing and depression suppressing effect for me, the first time i used it, lasted three to six months", "it was unbelievable how persistent it was", "wow", "i would say that is my answer", "that\u2019s fascinating", "good answer", "thanks", "i\u2019m going to ask a few questions that i don\u2019t think i got around to asking the first time", "alright", "when you hear the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind and why", "i would probably say philip rosedale", "okay", "who is philip and why", "he created second life virtual world way back in the day", "i have interviewed him on my show foundation", "back in the day, i had a podcast called foundation", "you can still find it", "i think it\u2019s foundation.bz", "the reason that i like him is on a couple of fronts", "i feel that he is a very creative person that fully accepts risk and goes in headfirst", "he is willing to try really wild and crazy ideas and really doesn\u2019t care if they fail", "he has done that throughout his career and has been very successful at it", "i really admire people that aren\u2019t afraid of failure and are willing to try big, bold things", "elon musk would be an easy answer on this front because he\u2019s trying so many really cool, big, bold ideas", "the founders of google are another example", "yeah, but i \u2013 i think it was larry page that said one of the things people miss is that, if you aim big enough it\u2019s very hard to fail completely", "you take something from it or learn lesson that you can then parlay into the next thing that\u2019s successful", "the problem i have with the founders of google \u2013 i\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting these guys and i think they\u2019re \u2013 i\u2019m not knocking them at all", "they\u2019re really brilliant and have created an amazing organization that continues to do great work", "the reason i like philip and picked him over the founders of google \u2013 you\u2019re mad about your adsense account", "they banned my adsense account", "no, seriously, it\u2019s because philip has these ideas that are just so crazy", "you\u2019ll have to go back and listen to my other podcast about how to manage people and projects and get group think to come together and create beautiful things", "they\u2019re kind of out of this world ideas and i\u2019m attracted to that", "for some reason, i like the really crazy thinkers", "i just had jason fried on my podcast that i do for the journal", "he has created an amazing start-up", "we were talking about the culture he creates in his company", "he said, \u201ci want to pay people for getting eight hours of sleep.\u201d and he wants to track that", "you come in with your fitbit, you open your account and it shows you slept a full eight hours and you get paid a bonus", "that\u2019s amazing", "he really cares about how he can take care of the entire life cycle of an individual in ways

wear a belt while you were boning, i guess", "darya\u2019s question was, \u201cwhere would you attach it?\u201d no, that\u2019s true", "there could be a fitbit cock ring or something", "seriously, let me say one last thing on this topic and then we can move on", "the butterfly", "you\u2019ve got my head all messed up now", "i think that in being a venture capitalist in silicon valley for so many years, we see the same pitches over and over", "you see modifications of, \u201chey, i\u2019m the uber for this", "i\u2019m the twitter for that", "i\u2019m the myspace for this.\u201d it\u2019s just

modulate", "he\u2019s been very consistent", "big time meditator, too", "he invented his own form of meditation", "i\u2019m not joking", "what characterizes it", "he counts to like 10,000 a day", "he does mantra-based meditation based on counting", "just single digits", "1, 2, 3 \u2013 yeah", "we were sitting there and he was like, \u201cyeah, i\u2019m at 587 right now.\u201d wait", "he does it \u2013 every day", "no, no", "as he\u2019s doing other activities", "oh, my god", "that sounds difficult", "he doesn\u2019t stop to do it", "he\u2019ll have like three minutes", "he\u2019ll be on a conference call and he\u2019s at like 6,737", "right, and then he stops and he goes \u2013 and if he has a minute he does an extra 100", "oh, he picks up", "yeah", "that sounds so stressful", "it totally does for me, but it works for him", "whatever works", "next question", "it\u2019s after midnight now", "if you could change any law, what would it be", "and you can\u2019t say drugs", "let me think about this for a second", "is there anything that just drives you nuts and you\u2019re like, \u201cwhy is that a law?\u201d you have to have some political somewhere \u2013 i do", "i\u2019ve gone through this recently", "i\u2019ve been told i\u2019m a libertarian", "i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not", "i think that there are laws \u2013 and perhaps all laws should be revisited and reassessed on occasion", "there are certain laws that are put in place to, in the best cases, create the greatest good for the greatest number of people in circumstances that then change", "for instance, i\u2019m building a barrel sauna and it\u2019s relatively small", "it looks like a gigantic wine barrel", "it\u2019s based on plans that were given to me by rick rubin, who got them from laird hamilton", "it\u2019s an incredible set-up", "it\u2019s surprisingly inexpensive", "and to put that on my own property, out of view of any neighbors, was just like trying to broker a fucking peace treaty between north and south korea", "why did you tell your neighbors", "no, no", "it has nothing to do with my neighbors", "it has everything to do with getting city and town permits and all of that kind of stuff", "no, don\u2019t do that", "just do it yourself", "just don\u2019t do it", "no, no, no", "you have to do that", "in any case, this is just one example", "i\u2019m generally a small government guy", "i really feel like, if you look at for instance crises or natural disasters \u2013 in earthquakes, in the blitz where london was being bombed in world war ii, people develop social structures and rules that keep the peace and assign roles to different types of people and create order amongst themselves", "now, i\u2019m not an anarchist", "i\u2019m not saying the government shouldn\u2019t exist", "but i do think that we\u2019ve edged too far into a nanny state type of dependency that is not a healthy dependency whatsoever", "it\u2019s created a stifling environment for certain things \u2013 whether it is this barrel sauna or hiring really good non us citizens to work at your startup", "that\u2019s a big issue", "i know a lot of icons in silicon valley have been working on it, but why is this so hard", "it is completely ludicrous", "especially based in a country where the blend of cultures and innovation we have is directly a consequence of massive immigration", "it\u2019s outrageous", "in any case, that\u2019s my rant", "if i could change any law \u2013 nothing super specific", "the sauna laws", "i need to provide more money to the sauna lobby", "do a fundraiser for the sauna law and get a t-shirt", "i\u2019m sure i could come up with a better answer if i thought more about it", "oh, here\u2019s one", "i think that it should be easier for a loved one to take their loved one off of life support, or provide ethical euthanasia in cases where that has been sort of prearranged", "i don\u2019t think the state should have a say in that", "i think if that is something that has been documented and agreed upon beforehand, that should be an option in more circumstances", "yeah", "sucks to see people suffer", "yeah", "alright, what\u2019s my question", "these are pretty short ones", "what is the book or books that you\u2019ve gifted most to other people", "number one would be miracle of mindfulness", "that\u2019s thich nhat hanh", "right", "have you ever read that book", "it\u2019s a great book", "yeah, it\u2019s great", "it was the one that really got me into mindfulness and applying it to everyday life", "there is a

anecdote, though", "i know", "the point being, if you\u2019re thinking about the plum when you\u2019re washing the dishes, when you\u2019re eating the plum you\u2019re going to be thinking about your

like five months\u2019 worth of resveratrol \u2013 like multiple bottles", "oh no", "don\u2019t do this at home, kids \u2013 i consumed all of the bottles", "i had to consume something like 120

here", "i\u2019ll just flash forward and give you guys a snapshot and then explain what happened", "i\u2019m sitting there in this meeting and there was a serious, brilliant, hilarious guy sitting there", "he\u2019s like explaining this very seriously to me and it\u2019s like a 10-minute intro to what i\u2019m about to do", "out of nowhere, i start sweating fucking bullets \u2013 a cold sweat",

sweat\u2019s coming into my eyes", "he\u2019s like, \u201care you okay?\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201ci need a hamster wheel stat.\u201d i was like, \u201cdo you have a bathroom nearby.\u201d he

around that time was when i was creating digg for the first time", "it exploded and got a bunch of users and we grew the company to a pretty decent size", "the issue was, at that age, i was still really immature", "if i would sit down with my younger self, i would say to that person to seek out mentors and stop acting like you know it all", "when i didn\u2019t know something, i refused to learn it", "i wanted to focus on what i already knew i was good at", "i was really good at the creative side and coming up with new feature ideas and product ideas, but when it came down to hiring staff or interviewing folks \u2013 all of the other pieces of business you have to learn in order to succeed \u2013 i didn\u2019t have any of that", "rather than admit i didn\u2019t know it, i just turned a blind eye to it", "that caused a lot of problems later", "i was like, \u201cokay, i\u2019m going to focus on this small domain and hire other people to take over my weak spots.\u201d i first of all didn\u2019t know how to hire the right folks", "we hired some great people, but gave the keys to the castle to folks rather than taking on the hard work, which was admitting i didn\u2019t know these things and putting in the time and effort to become proficient in them", "that\u2019s what i\u2019d go back to that 25-year-old self with", "it\u2019s a lot of the stuff that i\u2019m still learning today", "as a fourth or fifth time entrepreneur having a startup, i\u2019m putting in a lot of time and effort", "i feel like i\u2019m mature enough now at almost 40", "if i don\u2019t know

"exactly", "and it only happens once", "you have that small little bash to your ego for 10 minutes, but you get introduced to the right folks and you admit that you don\u2019t know something", "and guess what, that never comes up again", "you can go and get schooled up on that", "that\u2019s good advice", "what is the worst advice that you hear being thrown around to startup founders, or in general", "what is some bad advice that\u2019s given frequently", "well, i\u2019ve seen many a startup that believes that when they have a little bit of traction it\u2019s the time to go raise a bunch of capital and spend into that and hope for the best", "oftentimes, you see a lot of bloat created and a lot of extra pressure to hit certain milestones that don\u2019t make sense and then cause you to make really bad short-term decisions for the business to bring in revenue when it\u2019s not going to help in the long-term", "there are bunch of examples i can give here and i don\u2019t want to pick on any one individual company", "that said, let me pick on one company", "when people are like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to be an asshole, but,\u201d that usually means they\u2019re immediately going to be an asshole", "i know", "there\u2019s that great onion article that says the devil\u2019s advocate turns out to be just a big asshole", "i love that article", "it\u2019s so true", "side note \u2013 i heard this comedian say, \u201cwhen someone says, \u2018i\u2019m a taxpayer,\u2019 it means they\u2019re about to be an asshole.\u201d totally", "a great example of this is a company like fab.com", "i was an angel investor there", "it had a great founder and a great seed of an idea \u2013 it was a great pivot from the site they were before into a very design-oriented e-commerce play", "it had a great following and was doing \u2013 the conversions on these little flash tails were working quite well", "they went out and raised several monster rounds, hired a bunch of employees, and just spent into this business and blew through a bunch of capital", "when the novelty wore off, the business went away", "that said, growing thoughtfully and in line, in track, and in parallel with your revenue, and being more responsible around that makes a lot of sense", "don\u2019t over raise capital and spend too much cash up front", "i think we\u2019re getting better at that as an industry", "i think there has been enough fires now that people can see that\u2019s not the wisest way to go", "that said, we still see things like uber and others that are just raising monster amounts of cash", "but the good news is that they have real revenue to back it up", "i think this was very much a thing when you don\u2019t have the revenue and you\u2019re going and doing this \u2013 it\u2019s a bad decision", "also, if we\u2019re looking at fab versus uber, the fab example is very different in the respect that it\u2019s not necessarily a winner take all market where they have to dominate a city or a country or a continent to become the de facto choice for ridesharing", "there are certain network effects, or marketplace dynamics, where if they have the most drivers then they\u2019ll have the most riders", "the riders want to have the fastest pick-up time", "if they have the most riders, then they\u2019ll be able to recruit the most drivers", "it\u2019s a virtuous cycle for the person who owns the most market share on both sides of that equation", "but in a fab case, or many cases like it, there are a lot of perverse incentives at play", "there are particularly perverse incentives at play in an environment like we are either just coming out of or still in", "there are many people who would disagree with this, and i don\u2019t have issues with smaller examples", "but there are startups that are on their way to failure and the founders know", "they take a ton off the table, the employees see nothing, and then it just craters", "right", "that is a byproduct of being able to raise these monster rounds, in part \u2013 riding momentum of i-bonds as opposed to revenue", "that\u2019s one of the reasons i got dismayed and disillusioned with a lot of the exchanges", "they\u2019re certainly not long-term relationship building, but a lot of the transactional exchanges that happens in that startup eco system \u2013 there are a lot of positives to taking venture capital", "one of the negatives is that the founders are pushed to build a bigger and bigger business", "for example, when i first launched digg, i launched it as just a tech only news site", "it quickly became the largest tech news site in the world", "there was no doubt we had more traffic than any \u2013 at the time, cnet was big and a couple of other blogs", "but when a certain amount of dollars came to the table, it was like, \u201chey, what we love what you\u2019re doing with digg as a tech site", "why don\u2019t you go into world news and politics and science and all of these other categories?\u201d so we did that", "and then that was great and we had 38 million people a month coming to our site", "\u201cbut wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could get to 50-100 million people coming to your site per month", "why don\u2019t expand into something that my mom would like to use and embrace some of the traditional news sites and help them promote their content?\u201d things that just weren\u2019t naturally organic in our dna \u2013 that is the danger", "if fab had stayed small or digg had stayed small and focused on their core and stayed true to their dna, they wouldn\u2019t be forced to make these unnatural decisions that eventually lead them not servicing their audience", "in fairness, though \u2013 i\u2019ll play devil\u2019s advocate/asshole here", "if you sign up for taking venture capital, you have to understand the economics of venture capital", "they need you to grow", "they, in turn, have their bosses who are the lps with a fiduciary responsibility to try to generate a 10x or 100x return for a few startups", "the rest are going to be dogs, dead, or zombies", "and i think that\u2019s where, as kevin the 25-year-old founder versus where i am today, the difference is that the 25-year-old kevin would\u2019ve taken that as gospel", "\u201chey, you should go do x, y, and z.\u201d \u201cokay, i\u2019m going to go do that", "that sounds great", "you guys have been down this road before.\u201d the kevin today would say, \u201cthank you very much, trusted advisor,\u201d and take that into consideration", "oftentimes it is great advice", "eight times out of ten you\u2019re going to agree with them", "but there\u2019s that couple of times when you\u2019re going to say, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make sense for my business", "i respect you and your idea, but we\u2019re not going to do that", "it\u2019s just not.\u201d and they can\u2019t force your hand in that unless they have control of the board, in which case that\u2019s a whole separate conversation", "alright", "i have two more questions for you", "let\u2019s do it", "biggest misconception people have about you", "that i have an issue with hard work", "i don\u2019t have an issue with hard work", "i have an issue with hard work applied to stupid things", "you should focus on being effective, picking the right things to do before you focus on being efficient, which is doing things well", "do you really only work four hours a week", "oh god", "here\u2019s the reality, and you know this", "i know you\u2019re verbally fucking tickling my balls to make me uncomfortable", "the fact is, i don\u2019t have to work at all if i don\u2019t want to work", "that is not the driver for me at this point in my life", "i was just joking", "you don\u2019t have to answer this question", "oh goddammit", "i\u2019m not allowed to have booze right now", "i could use some booze, but i\u2019m not gonna do it for reasons i can\u2019t discuss", "top secret", "continue", "okay, next question", "this is a very serious question", "i think other people out there will be curious about this", "the rumors about by 21-inch cock are all true", "there you

true", "i\u2019m joking", "i\u2019m looking for a half-japanese, half-italian, bisexual \u2013 be serious", "\u2013 architect, super athlete, part time swimsuit model", "you\u2019re not joking, either", "that\u2019s the funny part", "i know you well enough to know you\u2019re joking for the podcast but you\u2019re really not joking", "who knows how to squat with the least body weight", "this is actually what you\u2019re looking for", "i\u2019ll put it this way", "i wouldn\u2019t mind that", "that sounds like a very enjoyable conversation", "i look for generally what i look for in a human being", "do you want someone who can kick your ass, though", "you\u2019re a hardcore person", "yeah, i\u2019m hardcore", "i\u2019d say of all my friends, you are \u2013 even though you can relax and meditate, you\u2019re very into shit and take stuff very seriously", "yeah, i\u2019m hardcore about a lot of things", "i can be hard around the edges", "these are characteristics that i don\u2019t know if i could fix and i\u2019m not sure i want to fix them", "i\u2019ve seen so many benefits from them", "they\u2019ve been useful tools", "i will tell you i\u2019ve dated women who are very, very feminine and yen \u2013 very swirling in emotional range and very nurturing", "i\u2019ve also dated women who are extremely tough and make me want to be more resilient, less reactive, hyper driven",

than what is currently available", "we\u2019ll see", "i think it\u2019s a pretty \u2013 i would say there\u2019s a couple of different camps in the virtual reality space", "there\u2019s one that

super bowl party", "we\u2019re wearing headsets and trying to cram freaking nachos underneath the mask", "that\u2019s a real thing", "people are saying that kind of stuff", "i believe the maintenance and set up is just really difficult", "i don\u2019t see the super bowl soon", "i don\u2019t see that type of interaction happening", "you\u2019re sacrificing an element", "we could all watch the fricking super bowl at home by ourselves", "but we go to a super bowl party", "why", "there\u2019s a communal aspect to it and elements of that experience that are not fully accounted for when someone brings up the example of the super bowl party and using it so you can stand in the middle of the field and have a fucking crazy 300-pound guy charge at you", "that sounds like fun", "maybe there are permutations on that that could work, but with something like call of duty, where you\u2019re sitting in your basement in your underwear playing it anyway, i think \u2013 in that case, let\u2019s say it is a hype cycle", "what does the landscape of vr look like in three years or five years", "has this been abandoned", "obviously, a lot of money is going into game development and app development in vr \u2013 tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars from some of the top companies", "but it\u2019s one of those things where, if consumers don\u2019t demand this hardware and it doesn\u2019t sell through, then those funds are going to quickly dry up", "it\u2019s very much a chicken and egg thing", "you need original content, and original experiences, more so than just a flying whale coming by your head that\u2019s in a 30-second demo", "you need real content that\u2019s developed for vr, which is expensive to create", "it\u2019s a chicken and egg thing, but you need a hell of a lot of eggs", "you need a lot of great games", "if you get in there and have a mediocre experience or, \u201ci only have two headsets", "we can\u2019t play co-op,\u201d there\u2019s 1,000 use cases i could describe where it ends up frustrating the gamer and it sits in the corner and they go back to the way things were", "this has been tried time and time again", "this isn\u2019t the first type of \u2013 i had a nintendo power glove back in the day", "i put my hand in the glove and i tried to do different things with it", "do you remember that thing with the little keyboard on the side of it", "i do remember it", "we\u2019ve tried these devices to augment our gaming experiences and yet we all still come back to the standard controller", "it\u2019s easy", "i can toss you one", "we can sit there and drink a beer while we\u2019re doing it", "there\u2019s a thousand little things you can do that you can\u2019t do with these big-ass headsets on", "and you need a dedicated room if you\u2019re going to walk around with them", "you\u2019d be bumping into furniture and shit", "there are so many hurdles to get over here", "i just think those hurdles are a little too high", "i will say one thing", "augmented reality is very much different than virtual reality, and that i still think the jury\u2019s out", "i\u2019m talking about where you put on a pair of glasses that allow you to project \u2013 at least back into your eye \u2013 the idea of there being little living creatures and different things crawling around in your furniture", "have you seen some of those things", "i have", "they scare the shit out of me", "that is cool enough", "it\u2019s not just that", "it\u2019s like overlaying things onto reality as you visually experience it today", "that\u2019s right", "that i haven\u2019t written off yet", "but this idea of virtual reality \u2013 and i\u2019ll be the first to admit i\u2019m wrong if two years from now this is not the case", "but i just had this gut feeling", "sometimes i like to be a little bit different than everybody else", "stir the pot", "yeah", "you have a bet riding on this, do you not", "on virtual reality failing", "yeah", "don\u2019t you have a \u2013 oh, adam, yeah", "i\u2019m betting a neuroscience friend of ours \u2013 very well-known neuroscientist", "he\u2019s on your podcast", "adam gazzaley", "he has drunk the kool-aid", "he\u2019s poured the kool-aid into the water, mixed it, and drank it", "he\u2019s hardcore", "just as context, darya used to work with adam", "is it fair to say he\u2019s one of the preeminent neuroscientists in the world", "md, phd, studies gaming, has developed gaming, has a lab at ucsf \u2013 one of the best regarded in the country, certainly", "what does that \u2013 50 people", "something like that", "this isn\u2019t like a homeless guy on the corner with a sandwich board saying vr is coming", "you have a qualified opponent", "no, i get that", "i think that he is a good opponent", "he is not a technologist", "he\u2019s a neuroscientist", "he has a dedicated big-ass room for virtual reality", "so when he goes and plays in virtual reality \u2013 and i\u2019ve been in his lab and played with his equipment \u2013 it is quite fun", "but he has a big-ass room that he gets to \u2013 not everyone has that room", "i don\u2019t have that room here in new york", "it\u2019s a different environment when \u2013 how specific are your criteria for success of failure", "for me \u2013 it\u2019s very loose", "\u2013 if there are fucking rooms all over a given city, and then in every city, where people can go experience virtual reality, that seems like it\u2019s at least gaining a foothold", "that would be some measure of success", "i think that virtual reality as a form of laser tag could be really interesting", "i actually saw that a week ago and it looked pretty fascinating", "it had 10 people in a room that were all wearing headsets", "they could see each other in the virtual world", "monsters could appear and they could run around corners and shoot them and things like that", "but that\u2019s just scandia fun", "that\u2019s like mini golf", "that\u2019s going to be a \u2013 scandia", "scandia\u2019s a thing on the west coast", "it\u2019s a mini golf course where you go ride go carts and play mini golf", "that\u2019s the kind of fun that is", "i think that what adam\u2019s talking about is this in almost every home and it being a fixture of your household", "see, i think you\u2019re overweighting the entire room experience, which is definitely an enhancement and improvement over the stationary experience", "but i could see people with immersive sound systems in the headsets themselves so you have surround sound, using the headset in conjunction with a controller, and having an incredible virtual reality experience", "we\u2019ll see, dude", "i\u2019ll tell you a story that i probably shouldn\u2019t tell", "i was at google and i went to google x, which is very limited access", "they do all of the crazy and top secret experiments", "they had google glass before they announced it", "i somehow talked the glass team into giving me one of the first prototypes outside of the team", "so i got one of the first 10 units", "it had the beta software on it and i had it hooked up to my android phone", "i could see all of my text notifications", "it was the coolest thing if you were in silicon valley to have back then", "no one had one", "i wore it to a party one time and it was stupid", "i remember", "a friend of ours showed up at south by southwest with google glass on and it was just a nerd magnet", "throngs of people were surrounding her everywhere she went", "as my wife will tell you, i had mine for two weeks or something like that", "i gave it back to the glass team", "they were like, \u201cwhat the fuck", "everybody wants one of these", "why are you turning this in?\u201d they expected me to have it for the next three months", "i\u2019m just like, \u201cno one is going to use this", "it\u2019s too dorky", "it\u2019s another thing i have to charge", "we don\u2019t need more of those in our lives", "it\u2019s heavy", "it\u2019s bulky.\u201d i didn\u2019t understand it and that was my gut, consumer, product person\u2019s take on it", "i ended up just abandoning it", "i feel the same way about virtual reality", "only time will tell", "i don\u2019t think it will take that much time, either", "i think there is so many big announcements and launches coming up soon", "within the next year or 18 months, we should have a pretty good idea of what\u2019s going to fly or not fly", "what\u2019s at stake", "it requires a trip to japan to buy a bottle of hibiki 30-year aged whiskey, which you can\u2019t find in the united states", "they don\u2019t import it into the united states", "that\u2019s a good bet", "it\u2019s a good bet", "it\u2019s a win/win because i\u2019m going to help him drink some of it if i have to give it to him", "it should be fun", "i think that, even if i lose the bet, i\u2019ll be pretty impressed and happy", "if they come out with a few titles where i\u2019m just blown away, i\u2019ll be the first to say this is going to take off", "but my gut doesn\u2019t tell me so", "the jury\u2019s out", "we\u2019ll see", "well, another random show on the books", "you already mentioned the journal", "i will tell people", "check out the t-shirts", "i\u2019ve never done t-shirts before", "100 percent of the proceeds are going to psychedelic research, most likely psilocybin, at top universities", "i\u2019m not making anything from it whatsoever", "everything is going to senior scientists who are working on very fascinating applications of compounds that have been neglected", "they can potentially address some extremely debilitating conditions that have very few options otherwise medically speaking", "check out the shirts", "if you like them \u2013 american apparel shirts", "i\u2019ll have to look", "i went through \u2013 is it cotton or a blend", "most likely a blend", "i went through all of my own t-shirts and picked out the most comfortable and the designs that i liked and sat down with a sourcing team and looked at how to make the most comfortable shirts possible", "i\u2019m test driving the prototypes", "they\u2019re not made from mushrooms", "they\u2019re not made from mushrooms", "they don\u2019t disintegrate", "you don\u2019t take a shower with them and sprout anything", "you can\u2019t grind them up and eat them", "that would be pretty amazing, but no", "fourhourworkweek.com/mushroom", "check them out", "find us on twitter if you have anything to correct, say, or add", "and i feel like that\u2019s about it", "that\u2019s it", "thanks for listening", "alright, thanks for listening, guys", "you can find show notes, links to various things that we have mentioned, at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, as well as show notes for every other episode", "until next time", "see you", "thanks for sticking around"]}
