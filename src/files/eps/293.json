This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to explore the stories, tactics, strategies, habits, et cetera, of people who are the best at what they do, and this episode is a very special episode. It delivers a lot of the hard tactics, book recommendations, and so on that you would expect from one of these conversations, but it\u2019s also very unique, and I say \u201cvery unique\u201d to bother all my friends who say that you cannot have a modifier in front of \u201cunique.\u201d My guest today is Catherine \u2013 otherwise known as Cat \u2013 Hoke. After being given a second chance of her own \u2013 which we\u2019ll get into \u2013 Catherine founded Defy Ventures, a national nonprofit organization that \u201ctransforms the hustle of currently and formerly incarcerated people.\u201d Defy has produced groundbreaking results, including a recidivism rate \u2013 that means being readmitted to prison \u2013 of less than 5 percent and an employment rate of 95 percent. Defy\u2019s vision is to end mass incarceration as we know it by using entrepreneurship as a tool to transform legacies and human potential. Cat is amazing on many different levels \u2013 personal, athletic, and otherwise \u2013 and we\u2019re going to dig into the many facets of her life and lessons learned from her father, among many others. Catherine has also been named a \u201cMake Tech Human Agent of Change\u201d by Wired and one of the \u201c17 Global Influencers Expanding Human Possibility Through Technology\u201d by Nokia. Cat also received the MDC Partners Humanitarian Award and was included in Forbes\u2019 \u201c40 Women to Watch Over 40.\u201d She has been named by Fast Company one of the most creative people in business and is an Ashoka Fellow, among many other things. She is the author of the brand-new book \u2013 and, this is how I was introduced to her via Seth Godin \u2013 called A Second Chance, and I recommend that everybody check that out. And, you can certainly find her and Defy on all of the socials, but we are going to get into every aspect of that and much more. So, without further ado, please enjoy one of my favorite conversations I\u2019ve had in a very long time with Catherine \u201cCat\u201d Hoke. Cat, welcome to the show. Catherine Hoke: Thanks, Tim Tim Ferriss: I have been excited to connect with you because I received a barrage of texts from a mutual friend of ours, Mr. Seth Godin, and I thought we\u2019d start this with something I\u2019ve been wondering that I actually don\u2019t know the answer to, which is how did you first meet Seth? Catherine Hoke: I sent Seth a cold email and he responded. I invited him to Defy Ventures, the organization that I run. I used to have a brick-and-mortar classroom-style teaching model where we would have formerly incarcerated people come to a classroom in New York City, and we\u2019d invite world-class faculty to come, and Seth was someone I really wanted to meet. I couldn\u2019t believe when he said yes, and then he came and taught \u2013 we call them \u201cEITs,\u201d or entrepreneurs in training \u2013 he came and met them, and the way that he treated me was like I was such an important person. I couldn\u2019t believe it. And then, he became my mentor. Tim Ferriss: Just like that, Seth Godin is a mentor. That is a very productive afternoon. Catherine Hoke: I feel like a spoiled brat, yeah. I\u2019m really proud to say that he\u2019s not just my mentor, but my friend, and has encouraged me to shoot for the moon. I\u2019ve done far greater things than I would have expected that I could have done had it not been for Seth. He has believed in me when I have not even believed in myself. Tim Ferriss: Well, he\u2019s an incredible man, and we may circle back to Seth, but I want to talk about this cold email because you seem to be good at cold emails and cold letters, and I have to be careful about what I believe on the internet, but I\u2019m going to circle this back to something that took place much further back than your meeting with Seth. But, what did the email say? What did the pitch look like? Catherine Hoke: I should look. So, I cold-emailed him and one of our volunteers simultaneously cold-emailed him, which always helps. Typically, when I cold-email people \u2013 because I\u2019ve gotten amazing people to respond through cold email \u2013 a lot of times, I just say, \u201cI\u2019m going to change the world and I would like to meet with you to pick your smart brain for 15 minutes,\u201d and then, I\u2019m persistent as hell, and I send it back to them six times, and sometimes I leave them voicemails as well, and I befriend their assistant. So, that\u2019s how I got in to meet with Duncan Niederauer, who was the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, and many people who you would think would not say yes to a cold email, but when I asked for 15 minutes to pick their smart brain \u2013 and, I tell them exactly what I want to learn from them, too. It\u2019s not like a random \u2013 I tell them, \u201cYou\u2019re an expert in this and I need to learn X.\u201d And, I also tell them, \u201cI can talk really fast and you can kick me out of your office as quickly as you want if you think it\u2019s a waste of time. So, I always give them an out, but it\u2019s not like I need to do that, and then, I just don\u2019t stop. I was trained in Cutco knife sales \u2013 door-to-door stuff \u2013 and I\u2019ve been a shameless cold-caller. I used to work for Summit Partners, a venture capital and private equity firm, where I would cold-call CEOs, wanting to get a piece of their pie. I don\u2019t get hurt by rejection. I\u2019m able to take it. But, when I\u2019ve studied sales, most salespeople stop after two or three, and I keep going to six, and it\u2019s amazing how many people end up saying yes. And then, I always \u2013 a typical sales trick is I\u2019ll throw in another five seconds of information about something that makes them go, \u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019ll tell them something about myself. So, I\u2019ll tell them something about their background that we have in common. Tim, I know that you were a wrestler, so I would say, \u201cBy the way, I was also a high school wrestler,\u201d something that makes you go, \u201cWhat?\u201d and gets your attention. Tim Ferriss: All right. We have so much that we can cover and so many different rabbit holes we can go down. There are a few things I want to flesh out a little bit. First, the Cutco knives \u2013 I was going to ask you about the Cutco knives, and I\u2019m going to try not to lose my train of thought here, but there are so many ways I want to go with this. Catherine Hoke: Thank you for doing such great research. Tim Ferriss: Of course. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. You started with selling hamsters at age 7 or thereabouts? Catherine Hoke: Wow, you really went way back. Yes, I did. I ran a hamster-selling empire. I would breed them, and I had multiple cages, and then I sold them back to the pet shop for $1.00 apiece. My sister took after me. She was breeding rabbits, so we had quite the household. Tim Ferriss: And then, selling golf balls. Catherine Hoke: Yeah. I would take off my shoes and socks, walk through the disgusting duck muck, and get the golf balls. But then, I would also one-up the golfers with donuts and all types of other things to increase my profits. Tim Ferriss: What is the key to a successful \u2013 and, people listening are like, \u201cWhat the fuck is going on right now?\u201d This is all going somewhere. The Cutco knives \u2013 so, this is door-to-door, we\u2019re talking about? Knock knock, wipe the feet \u2013 Catherine Hoke: So, if Cutco were listening, they might cringe if I said \u201cdoor-to-door\u201d because you\u2019re supposed to have a developed network, and with every person you go meet with, you ask them for three references. \u201cDid you have a good experience with me today? Would you recommend me to your friends? Send me to three other people.\u201d So, it\u2019s not totally door-to-door, but it\u2019s kind of that style. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s in-person selling? Catherine Hoke: Yeah. So, my biggest problem with selling Cutco was that I was raised by a Hungarian Yugoslav immigrant who came over with $200.00 in his pocket and thought that buying us a Happy Meal was too expensive, so I was selling Cutco $1,400.00 knife sets, and I was really good at it, and Cutco, they taught me how to nod my head and smile to get that reciprocal behavior, and say, \u201cWill you buy my $1,400.00 knife set?\u201d People were saying yes to me all the time, and I was enjoying the fact that I was so good at it, but I totally felt like I was scamming people, and little did I realize that rich people don\u2019t mind paying $1,400.00 or more for an amazing set of cutlery \u2013 which, by the way, I still own myself and completely believe in \u2013 but because I felt like I might have been scamming people, I had to stop selling Cutco knives, and I reduced my own profits because I felt like I was ripping people\u2019s faces off. So, you get these free products that you can give them. \u201cOh, here, I\u2019ll give you my free cake slicer,\u201d and you\u2019re supposed to use those to help get them to a bigger knife set, but I would get them to say yes to the biggest, most expensive set, and then I would feel guilty for selling them on something so big, so I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you these five free products as well.\u201d Tim Ferriss: \u201cAnd by the way, can you tell me the names of three of your friends you would recommend that I also \u2013?\u201d Catherine Hoke: Exactly. And then, I would get economies of scale on this stuff because when I was on the wrestling team as the only girl, we had to raise money for that, so I would literally go door to door, and after I\u2019d win a match and my wrestling photo was in the Sunday paper, I would walk around door to door and be like, \u201cHi,\u201d and I\u2019d be in a dress, and I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019m on the Davis High School wrestling team, and I\u2019m raising money, and we\u2019re pushing cars around the track, so will you give us money?\u201d And then, I would do that and sell Cutco knives at the same time. Tim Ferriss: So, wait a second. By \u201cat the same time,\u201d do you mean, \u201cHey, thanks for the $50.00 to support the wrestling team. By the way, I notice that you have a cutting board\u201d? Catherine Hoke: No. I would ask for a separate appointment. I didn\u2019t want to totally overwhelm my customer. Tim Ferriss: Okay. That would be a hell of a cross-sell. Now, the promise I made earlier to wind this back \u2013 of course, I went all the way back to 7 \u2013 is it true that you were originally turned down by UC Berkeley? Is this accurate, that you wrote them a letter? Catherine Hoke: Well, I was admitted to UC Berkeley. I tried to get rejected because my dad wanted me to go to UC Berkeley and I wanted to get so far away from home. I had wrestled and gone to high school in Davis, and I looked up the hardest major to get into, which was bioengineering at Cal. It had a 4 percent chance of admission. Well, I got in, and I didn\u2019t really want to be an engineer, and I was flunking out of my engineering courses. I supported myself through school and I looked up a summer job that was for a management consulting firm \u2013 I had no clue what that was \u2013 and I remember reading the posting aloud to someone and saying, \u201cThis requires an entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d and I didn\u2019t know how to pronounce the word, and I was like, \u201cWhat the hell is that? What does that mean?\u201d Well, I got the job at the management consulting firm, and I discovered what business is, and decided I loved it, so I applied to the undergraduate Haas program at UC Berkeley, and I got rejected, and I\u2019m not surprised. I was literally failing out of my engineering courses because my brain is not really that of an engineer. And so, that\u2019s when I wrote them a seven-page appeal letter, and I was like, \u201cLook, I\u2019m a student-athlete. I work 40 hours a week on top of it. If you let me in, I promise I\u2019ll make you proud.\u201d And, they let me in. Tim Ferriss: So, where does this come from, this aggressive drive? You\u2019re spanning wrestling, which is \u2013 certainly, even now, but at the time \u2013 I think Margolis has raised the perception of women\u2019s wrestling in the U.S. tremendously, but certainly, back then, as a wrestler \u2013 myself throughout high school and the very beginning portions of college \u2013 women would not commonly go into wrestling. You had this entrepreneurial drive really early on. Where does that come from? Catherine Hoke: I feel like I was raised in a mini Shark Tank at my house. My dad is an inventor to this day. He\u2019s 73 years old, and he patents all types of stuff. He\u2019s an electrical engineer. He taught me to see the world through quite a different lens. When I was as young as age 6 or 7, he would have me stand up in family \u2013 and I never knew when he was going to do it \u2013 and say, \u201cYou have one minute to invent something, talk about the market and how you\u2019re going to price it, the demand, and your strategy for getting it out there.\u201d And, I would come up with ridiculous things. I can\u2019t even remember. I remember that one of my favorite inventions was shoes that could fly, and what I remember about doing that with my father is that he never told me that one of my ideas was stupid or not feasible. He could have just raised a very delusional child who thought that she could do anything, and I guess he kind of did, but I \u2013 whenever I saw problems and things that I didn\u2019t like about the world and would complain about them, my dad would say to me, \u201cInstead of complaining about it, why don\u2019t you figure out how you can fix it?\u201d For example, I was raised in a super weird immigrant home. I was not allowed to watch television, almost never. We were never allowed to watch sports. He said, \u201cWhy would you watch somebody else going out there and getting it when you could invest that same time in doing it yourself?\u201d So, he told me to get my butt out there, work out, and learn how to become the best at something. He said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to become a chimney sweeper, just become the best chimney sweeper.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t really know that there was another way, and I really believed I could do anything, so I thought \u2013 I was born in Canada and French was my first language. We came over to the U.S. when I was 7. When my dad got invited to come and teach at Stanford and told me that we were moving to the U.S., I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to because I can\u2019t become the President of the United States,\u201d and I have zero political aspirations today, by the way. But, when I told him I couldn\u2019t become the President, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a little time to think about that, about how you could come up with a solution for that problem.\u201d So, I came back to him a week or so later, and I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got it. We can move to the United States. I will become a lawyer. I will change the Constitution of the United States so that someone who\u2019s not born in the United States can become the President, and then I will become the President.\u201d And then, after we moved to the U.S., he introduced me to everybody as the future President of the United States. When he said it, I thought he was being serious. He believed in me, so I believed in myself, and I guess that\u2019s why I run something called Defy now. I actually believe I can do it. Like Jerry Colonna says, I am pathologically optimistic about my goals. Tim Ferriss: All right. That is a very thorough and extremely helpful answer. What was your dad invited to teach at Stanford? Catherine Hoke: Electrical engineering. Tim Ferriss: Electrical engineering. And, the reason you moved to the U.S. was because of the faculty invitation from Stanford? Catherine Hoke: Yup. He got a one-year invitation, and then, it turned into two years, and he could have stayed at Stanford, but my dad is a ski freak, and he just wanted to be closer to the mountains, so that\u2019s why we moved to Davis, and he taught at UC Davis. I\u2019m a lot like my dad in that he loves to invent stuff, so he left university life and is still \u2013 he works until 5:00 in the morning just inventing new stuff. Tim Ferriss: Sounds like a cool gig. Would he call himself an inventor \u2013? Catherine Hoke: Yes. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 a product developer, or neither? He would say \u201cinventor\u201d? Catherine Hoke: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What was your home like outside of your father? Was your mom around? Do you have siblings? Paint a picture for people. Catherine Hoke: I\u2019m the oldest of four kids. I was like a mini mom. My mother would literally want to bring homeless people back to our house. My mom\u2019s really compassionate and caring, and she used to be a nurse, but stayed at home to take care of the kids. I developed a lot of my compassion and heart for serving others from my mom, and I remember my mom telling me, \u201cEat all the food on your plate because there are starving kids in Africa.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay, if I don\u2019t eat all the food on my plate, how are the starving kids in Africa going to get my food?\u201d So, I think was 7 \u2013 this is from my dad, \u201cFind a solution to the problem.\u201d So, I found some sponsorship program to sponsor a kid in Africa. The golf ball money and hamster-selling money \u2013 I thought I was balling when I was 7 years old \u2013 I would send that money overseas to sponsor orphans. So, I developed a heart for other people and not just for making a buck. I\u2019m very competitive, if you can\u2019t tell, and I love money because I love what money can do to create the world that I want to live in. Tim Ferriss: You are competitive. I\u2019m going to add some more color to that. Please fact check and tell me if any of this is incorrect. California state women\u2019s wrestling champ, three-time marathon runner, college rugby player, varsity rower, and you still enjoy \u2013 we talked about this a little bit \u2013 the Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which has deprived me of the structural integrity of my ankle as of last week with some snapped ligaments. But, you are certainly very competitive, and I also want to note something that we discussed very briefly. During the sound check, before I hit \u201crecord,\u201d I asked you what your breakfast was, and you said, \u201cCoffee.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, I need a few more seconds, so just talk about your coffee for sound check.\u201d You said, \u201cMedium warm coffee. I put in ice cubes.\u201d And then, you kept on going. I thought you were making it \u2013 Catherine Hoke: You told me to talk for 15 seconds. Tim Ferriss: No, I know. I thought maybe you were making this up. I was like, \u201cWait, what\u2019s the story on the medium warm coffee? Can you tell people what the story is?\u201d Catherine Hoke: Well, I like to be very efficient and fast, and I like to eat fast and drink fast, so I put ice cubes in my coffee so I can pound it. I actually think things tend to taste better when I eat or drink them really fast. I don\u2019t understand people who like to chew on their food for two hours. It annoys me. I mean, it\u2019s fine for them, but not for me. Tim Ferriss: So, you and I have a number of overlapping circles. I am also of the fast \u2013 Catherine Hoke: Yeah, we\u2019re going to roll after this scenario, right? Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Catherine Hoke: I\u2019m going to meet you in Austin and we\u2019re going to roll. Tim Ferriss: You know what? I\u2019ll just let you triangle-choke me because given your credentials, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to give you much of a fight. Catherine Hoke: I can talk a big game, but I\u2019ll be gentle. Tim Ferriss: So, we talked about Seth. There seem to be a number of other people \u2013 we don\u2019t have to spend too much time on this, but I know, for instance, that I\u2019ve spent some time with Jerry Colonna, who you mentioned. Catherine Hoke: He\u2019s one of our faculty members, too. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Jerry is amazing. There\u2019s another \u2013 also, of course, these two know each other \u2013 Brad Feld, who is an incredible guy and an incredible investor as well. Where did the entrepreneurs in training enter the picture? How did that become part of your life? Catherine Hoke: When I was 26, I was working for a New York City private equity firm, and I got invited to present for the first time in my life, and that changed everything in my life because I used to think that people who were incarcerated were the scum of the earth. When I was 12, a good friend of mine was brutally murdered by two 16-year-old boys, and from that experience of one, I extrapolated to think that anyone in prison could rot and die in that place. It was that first prison visit \u2013 I\u2019m 40 years old now; we\u2019re three months apart, Tim \u2013 when I was 26, that visit opened my eyes and my heart, and it ended up \u2013 I didn\u2019t know it would end up becoming my life\u2019s calling, but it ended up changing my wallet, my priorities, and my time. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve devoted everything to now \u2013 the second chance field and working with people with criminal histories. The world calls them all types of things, like \u201cex-offender\u201d or \u201ccriminal,\u201d and I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t work with criminals. We work with people who committed criminal acts in their past, and there\u2019s a really big difference.\u201d So, at Defy, I believe we\u2019re all ex-somethings, and we call them EITs, or entrepreneurs in training. And then, they become full-fledged entrepreneurs. Tim Ferriss: So, I have a few notes just because I\u2019ve had sufficient caffeine to want to talk a lot. The first is a really important distinction that you made. As some backstory, before I hit \u201crecord,\u201d you asked me, \u201cDo I have the right to call you out if you call them criminals?\u201d and I said, \u201cYes, you do.\u201d The language we use is so important in this context and many others. For instance, I have tried very hard for myself to not call myself an anxious \u2013 \u201cI am anxious\u201d \u2013 to use that language or to say, \u201cI am an anxious person.\u201d Rather, I say, \u201cI feel anxiety\u201d to depersonalize it in that way. So, \u201cpeople with a criminal past\u201d is different than \u201cex-criminal\u201d or \u201ccriminal.\u201d They\u2019re very distinct labels that create an entirely distinct way of relating to somebody with one versus the other. I just want to underscore how important that is, not just for how you label other people, but how you label yourself. Catherine Hoke: Absolutely. We\u2019re big on that; really big on how we label ourselves. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s really important. The question, then, that I have is why did this stick? Why did this become what appears to be a lifelong passion and commitment, whereas you had tried so many things in the past and you\u2019re no longer selling hamsters or doing private equity? Why did this stick? Was there a specific conversation? Was there a specific moment? What was it that made this stick for you? Catherine Hoke: I didn\u2019t think it would stick, and when I went to prison that very first time in Texas, what I saw there shocked my heart. I have made so many bad decisions and mistakes in my own life, and I\u2019m really grateful for the grace and second chances that I\u2019ve received, yet I was so quick to write off and label people who had been caught for something criminal. So, I was convicted by the ugliness of my own heart because when I went and visited the prison, I realized \u2013 this might sound stupid \u2013 that they were actually human beings, not a rap sheet, not a number. And, the first guy the I met in prison that weekend \u2013 his name was Johnny \u2013 and I heard his story. When Johnny was 8 years old, he watched as his grandfather murdered his father right in front of him, and then, when Johnny was 11 or 12, he was given drugs, jumped into a gang, and by the age of 18, he was incarcerated. Empathy for the people that I serve is what made it stick because I was like, \u201cWow, had I been raised in those circumstances, I am certain that I would have ended up on that path as well.\u201d And, to this day, when I hear the stories of the people that I serve \u2013 I was just in a prison last week, and I do this exercise called \u201cStep to the Line.\u201d We have all our CEOs, venture capitalists, and executive volunteers on one side of the line, and then we have our EITs \u2013 or entrepreneurs-in-training, the incarcerated \u2013 on the other side of the line. You step to the line if each statement is true. \u201cStep to the line if you\u2019ve ever been arrested.\u201d About a third of our volunteers are at the line. \u201cStep to the line if you\u2019ve ever done something for which you could have been arrested, but you have not been arrested.\u201d 100 percent of our volunteers step to the line. \u201cStep to the line if you were arrested for the first time before the age of 16.\u201d Maybe 75 percent of our EITs step to the line. And then, I count backwards. \u201cStep to the line if you were incarcerated before the age of 14, 12, 10.\u201d And, I get to age 8, \u201cIf you were first incarcerated at the age of 8.\u201d There are four guys remaining at the line. \u201c7.\u201d There\u2019s one guy remaining at the line. And, I\u2019m trying to picture a 7-year-old or an 8-year-old in handcuffs, and normally, a prison cell seems pretty small and stifling, but imagine a little 7- or 8-year-old there. My empathy for the people that I serve is what made this stick for me, and I don\u2019t have pity for them, I have a deep compassion. I also have mad respect for their skills. I work with natural born entrepreneurs who started off selling gumballs out of their lockers \u2013 not hamsters \u2013 and gumballs proceeded into drugs, which kept going, and then they got arrested. But, I have a love of underdogs, and a love of entrepreneurs, and I hate injustice. When I was a little kid growing up and saw somebody else getting bullied, I would always stand up for them and defend the victim. Here I was in the midst of people who have been thrown away by society, who are not just aspiring entrepreneurs, but who are proven entrepreneurs with amazing talents. I believe that the people I serve represent America\u2019s most overlooked talent pool. That first weekend in Texas, when I was 26 years old and na\u00efve as could be, I went to four prisons, and at the last one, the guys were like, \u201cWill you please come back?\u201d I said yes. My dad also taught me to be a person of my word. I had no idea what it meant to come back, I had never talked to a warden before, but after I said yes, I was coming back, and I did. Tim Ferriss: Most likely, I\u2019m going to get this pronunciation wrong, but can you tell us \u2013 Catherine Hoke: I\u2019m all about second chances, Tim. I\u2019ve never used that one before, either. Tim Ferriss: I can tell you\u2019ve been working on your material. All right. \u201cCoss Marte\u201d? Is this correct? Catherine Hoke: Pretty good. Yeah, \u201cCoss Marte.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Can you tell us who Coss Marte is? Catherine Hoke: Yeah. He\u2019s one of our best-known success stories. He\u2019s a graduate of Defy Ventures. He did five years in prison in the New York State prison system, and he went to prison at age 19, so he grew up in poverty, heroin needles all around him, and he said that the one thing he wanted to become when he was older was rich. He didn\u2019t know how to get out of the system, but he saw his mother working overtime to put food on the table. So, when he was a young teenager, he got introduced to the world of selling drugs, and he got incarcerated for the first time at 12 or 13, I think, and bounced in and out. By the time he was 19 and got arrested on a kingpin case, he was running a drug empire in New York where he was doing $2 million a year in drug sales. He had an army of people working for him, and he was a young, natural entrepreneur, and when he was incarcerated, he realized that in fact, he was very entrepreneurial, but his entrepreneurial skillsets were being used to destroy communities rather than build them up. He had a wake-up call in prison when he was sent to the SHU \u2013 to solitary confinement \u2013 after having an altercation with an officer. He was also so overweight and unhealthy when he got sent to prison that doctors told him that he would die in prison, even though he was only doing five years. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m not dying in prison.\u201d So, while he was locked up in solitary confinement in a box that was the size of a parking spot, he came up with a body-weight-bearing workout and lost 70 pounds. When he got out of the SHU, he taught other incarcerated men at that prison \u2013 about 20 of them had to lose a collective 1,000 pounds, so he was onto something with his prison-style fitness workout, and he got out of prison, and he had always wanted to become a legal entrepreneur. So, with Defy\u2019s help, he turned that into ConBody, and ConBody is a prison-style fitness boot camp. In less than three years, it has had more than 14,000 customers. He said that he follows around women wearing yoga pants, asks them where they work out, and gives them his business card. He\u2019s hired nearly 20 people with criminal histories \u2013 other Defy Ventures graduates who have not started their own business \u2013 and we\u2019ve helped Coss to raise more than $250,000.00 in funding for his business because we run these Shark Tank-style pitch competitions, and he killed it in all of our competitions, and then we introduced him to other angel investors. What I love about Coss is that he\u2019s not just about his financial bottom line, but whenever I ask him to give back and serve, he always does. So, we work with Defy in the most notorious prison in America, called Pelican Bay, where they have a solitary confinement facility, and we run a program in solitary confinement. Coss came to Pelican Bay with me and led a workout for the incarcerated guys who are currently in the SHU. I can\u2019t tell you how awesome it was to have him. He was able to tell his story of going from the SHU to being a CEO, and his business continues to thrive and boom, and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City needed more foot traffic, so they literally opened up a ConBody gym inside Saks, and now, men and women \u2013 mostly women \u2013 are flocking through Saks to get to ConBody, where they go to these workouts. If you go to a ConBody workout, you\u2019ll be paired up with your \u201ccellie,\u201d and you\u2019ll have formerly incarcerated trainers that Coss has hired yelling at you to bring out the best in you and your physical fitness. He also has ConBodyLive.com, and he now has customers from 24 different countries that sign up for $5.00 a month, and it\u2019s amazing to watch his hustling skills combined with his heart, and the way that he uses his voice for prison reform and advocacy. I couldn\u2019t be prouder for us to be early incubators of ConBody and for us to be behind Coss Marte. Tim Ferriss: And, as I understand it, more than 150 businesses \u2013 the number may be outdated now \u2013 Catherine Hoke: It\u2019s now nearly 200 business that we have incubated and funded through our post-release incubator. Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate a little bit because I\u2019m sure there are people listening who have different emotional responses to the subject of the incarcerated or \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the currently incarcerated. How do you decide or vet those people who should be given second chances versus those who should remain incarcerated because they are genuine threats to society and unfit to be reintegrated? The reason I ask that is that I know people who are incarcerated who have been repeat offenders, violent offenders, who are \u2013 I hate to say it, but at this point, they should not be released in the short term, based on my firsthand experience watching what some of these people have done. How do you vet, filter, and train in such a way that you ensure \u2013 because your numbers are very impressive. I will have already read this in the introduction that I record separately, but let\u2019s reread the bio because I think we\u2019re going to dig into a bunch of different facets of it. So, if you can bear with me boring you by reading your own bio, here we go. After being given a second chance of her own \u2013 which we\u2019re going to come back to \u2013 Catherine founded Defy Ventures, a national nonprofit organization that transforms the \u201chustle\u201d of currently and formerly incarcerated people. Defy has produced groundbreaking results, including \u2013 this is the key here \u2013 a recidivism rate of less than 5 percent and an employment rate of 95 percent. Defy\u2019s vision is to end mass incarceration by using entrepreneurship as a tool to transform legacies and human potential. And then, you have many different accolades \u2013 \u201c100 Most Creative People in Business\u201d according to Fast Company, Ashoka Fellow in 2013 \u2013 but I won\u2019t get into all of those. How do you filter and cultivate the right people versus the wrong people? Catherine Hoke: All right. So, although I speak with great passion about Defy\u2019s EITs, I never take away from the fact that they have made grave mistakes, that they have hurt society, that they have hurt individuals, and that nothing about that is okay. So, I\u2019m not one of these people that say, \u201cOh, no one should go to prison. Let the prison doors fly open so everyone can just get out.\u201d When people hurt people and are a threat to society, they are sent to prison, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. In fact, I believe that an adult time out is often a very important element of people\u2019s transformation. So, I know that it\u2019s really important for people to have a consequence, and sometimes, that consequence really needs to be prison. Sometimes, people need to be taken out of society. I think we\u2019re way too liberal with the way that we hand out time, and I can get into my opinions of how we sentence people and the racial and economic disparities. I can get into that all day long because there is major injustice in that, but let\u2019s just go with this. When hurt people hurt other people, there needs to be a consequence, and I believe prison is often a solid consequence for that. It\u2019s called the \u201cfield of corrections,\u201d and unfortunately, when people are sent to prison, they\u2019re usually thrown away, and it\u2019s pure punishment. What many people in society don\u2019t realize is that 95 percent of incarcerated people are coming back out to become our neighbors. So, yes, the people I\u2019ve served have done some terrible things \u2013 sometimes, things that make my own stomach turn even though I\u2019m around these people and the crimes that they\u2019ve \u2013 I know their rap sheets intimately. So, what kind of neighbor do you want coming back to live next to you? Do you want someone who has not been rehabilitated or do you want someone who has been rehabilitated? At Defy, we actually work with people who have committed tougher crimes than most. We work at a lot of maximum security facilities \u2013 and, when I say we work in solitary confinement, you don\u2019t go to solitary confinement unless you\u2019ve made some really bad decisions. 90 percent of the people that we serve have committed violent crimes. People who commit murder \u2013 nearly all of them still get out of prison. I think people don\u2019t realize that. And so, if we lock them up like they\u2019re an animal and give them no resources, and when they get out, offer them no opportunities to make it legally, what are they going to go back to? As a society, we decide. The other thing is I\u2019m not the one who decides if they serve time or how much time they do. Our American judges, juries, and prosecutors determine that. According to the way our laws are set up, when you get sentenced to a term, you supposedly pay your debt to society, and unfortunately, when people get out prison, they\u2019re often treated like they\u2019re wearing invisible handcuffs for the rest of their lives. And, especially if you\u2019ve been a victim of a crime, you might be like, \u201cGood! I want them to permanently suffer.\u201d Well, I\u2019ve been a victim of multiple crimes\u2013 some of the worst crimes \u2013 myself, and vengeance can be a really ugly thing. When I get into a healthy place in my own head, I realize that if I had my vengeance on every human who has hurt me and just tortured them, it might bring out worse things in them, but if they could get healing for the ways that they have hurt me and live the fullest life that they could \u2013 up to their fullest potential \u2013 who would we be as a country if they had healing and forgiveness and didn\u2019t make other victims? That\u2019s what I want for myself and for the people I serve. We\u2019re all offenders. We all hurt people. I think that when it comes to people who are in prison, there\u2019s this real \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality. \u201cThey\u2019re in prison; they should rot in there.\u201d But, when our volunteers come to prison with us, I ask them some pretty challenging questions through that \u201cStep to the Line\u201d exercise. \u201cStep to the line if you have ever been in a fight to prove yourself. Go all the way back to your childhood. Even if you pulled the hair of a sibling, punched a boy who was picking on you in the park \u2013 something like that \u2013 as a little kid, as a 7- or 8-year-old, step to the line.\u201d I would say that 70 or 80 percent of our volunteers are at the line on that. And then, I say, \u201cStep to the line if you\u2019ve ever committed a violent crime.\u201d None of our volunteers are at the line, but close to 100 percent of our EITs are at the line. I tell the volunteers, \u201cI must not be making myself clear. I did not say to step to the line if you\u2019ve been convicted of a violent crime. Step to the line if you\u2019ve committed a violent crime. Earlier, 70 or 80 percent of you were at the line when I asked if you\u2019ve ever been in a childhood fight. Almost all of you were there.\u201d Well, the volunteers roll their eyes at me because they\u2019re like, \u201cCome on. The little fight that I got in at the playground? That\u2019s not a violent crime.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cActually, if you look at the backstories of the people that I serve, about half of them were arrested for the first time before they were 10 or 11, and when I ask them what it was for, they say, \u2018My mom was strung out and I broke into my neighbor\u2019s house to steal food because I was hungry,\u2019 or \u2018I was 10 and a 13-year-old was picking on me at the park, so I punched him in the face.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s stuff like that. It\u2019s very easy for us to turn the other person into a villain, into a wild, caged animal, to dehumanize the offender, but I can see myself in that offender, and I think that if we all look deep enough, many of us can see ourselves, and if you can\u2019t see yourself in that, I bet you could see your brother, your sister, or your best friend. If we were all permanently for the worst thing that we\u2019ve ever done, we might think a little bit differently about the labels that we attach to people. Unfortunately, once people go to prison or jail for the first time, when they\u2019re on their way out, a lot of officers will tell them, \u201cSee you back here.\u201d In our country, 76.6 percent of people are rearrested. Nearly everybody. If you go in once, it\u2019s a revolving door, and that is such a sad statistic. Another statistic that kills me is that 70 percent of the children of incarcerated people follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps. Quite a legacy to inherit. The good news is that we can break this legacy, and we can break that revolving door, and we\u2019re called Defy, and yeah, we have a return-to-prison rate of less than 5 percent, so this is a totally solvable problem. But, if we as Americans and society continue to write people off as being less than human and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gross that you even give them a chance,\u201d you\u2019re going to get a different kind of neighbor back, the kind of neighbor that is going to scare you, the kind of neighbor that none of us want. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. You mentioned something earlier that I think is worth underscoring, which is the question \u2013 I\u2019d be curious to know how people respond if you actually pose this to them, whether to volunteers or otherwise. \u201cWhat if you were only known for the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d Do you actually pose that, or is it a rhetorical question? Catherine Hoke: I do a lot of speaking engagements, and I open with that nearly every single time. I tell people, \u201cThink back to the action that you regret most in your life. Think about the labels that would be attached to that. \u2018Drunk,\u2019 \u2018cheater,\u2019 \u2018adulterer\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it is. And now, imagine for the rest of your life \u2013 it\u2019s 20 years later and you\u2019ve paid the consequences in full for whatever mistake you\u2019ve made, but now, you are permanently known as \u2018ex-drunk,\u2019 \u2018ex-cheater,\u2019 \u2018ex-embezzler,\u2019 \u2018ex-liar,\u2019 \u2018ex-shitty dad,\u2019 \u2018ex-whatever,\u2019 and you go fill out a job application, and at the top of your job application, it\u2019s the first thing you have to check the box on even though it\u2019s 20 years later. \u201cNext time that you want to rent an apartment or get a mortgage, it\u2019s the first thing you have to write \u2013 your ex-label. The people that I serve have paid their debt to society, but for the rest of their lives, they are known as an ex-drug dealer or an ex-fill-in-the-blank. What would your life be like if you were handcuffed by your most shameful moment?\u201d Tim Ferriss: Well, I suppose this is as good a place as any to segue into forgiveness, but the way we\u2019re going to get there \u2013 I remember when I was chatting with Seth, I wanted to know how openly we could talk about different parts of your biography. Your bio on the website begins with \u201cAfter being given a second chance of her own \u2013\u201d Can you explain what that refers to? Catherine Hoke: Sure. It should probably say, \u201cAfter being given so many second, third, and fourth chances,\u201d but I will share the mistake \u2013 the bad decisions \u2013 that I am most known for, since I ask other people what it would be like for them if they were known for that worst thing. So, the short version of it is that after devoting my life to working with people with criminal histories \u2013 I moved to Texas, I started what became known as Prison Entrepreneurship Program, PEP, and is still going there today, and I poured my everything into it. I had $50,000.00 in my bank account. It wasn\u2019t enough. I cashed out my 401(k) because working with these people and making sure that they had a bright future was more important than my own financial stability. I went all in on this, and for five years, I built up PEP to be a very successful prison rehabilitation program that was equipping men in the Texas prison system to become successful legal entrepreneurs, but more than that, employees, fathers, and voices in their communities. And then, I tanked. I made decisions that I thought ruined my everything and my entire future. So, the first time I was married, it was for nine years. I got married when I was 22. At the age of 31, I was served divorce papers, and I was living in Texas in a very Christian community where God hates divorce, and divorce is sin, and I was so ashamed. I said the one thing I would never be was a divorced woman, and here I was, a divorced woman. Following my divorce, I also went through a lot of hard times. I was sick with pneumonia, I was hospitalized, I had to move out of my house, and instead of reaching out to friends or a community that would have been supportive of me, in my own shame over my divorce, I put my head in the sand, and I felt so alone. When I was in the hospital and didn\u2019t know who to call to come pick me up, that was one of the loneliest, worst moments that I can remember. Well, the people that I felt comfortable confiding in over my personal failure were released graduates from the Texas prison system. The people who picked me up from the hospital were graduates. The people who packed up my boxes and moved me out of my house \u2013 I had been taking care of people for a long time, and now, I was at the bottom and needed to be taken care of. In a moment of weakness, I crossed boundaries and had some relationships with people who had been released from the Texas prison system. What I did was not illegal, but I knew better. I absolutely shouldn\u2019t have done it. I regretted it right afterward. I\u2019ve always taught my graduates a model of full disclosure. Own your mistakes and share them. Don\u2019t get caught. So, I followed my own advice, and I was honest about my poor decisions, and it cost me my everything at the time. It cost me everything. When the Texas prison system learned about my decisions, they forced my resignation and forced \u2013 this was eight years ago now \u2013 they forced it in the media, too. Up until that moment, I had been known \u2013 people called me the \u201cprison angel\u201d who \u201cministered to the dark side.\u201d That was absolutely not true, but \u2013 People had a Mother Teresa image of me because I was not known for big mistakes yet, and then, my news came crashing in the media, and I became known for a sex scandal instead of the good work that I had poured my life into. I was already suffering from so much shame, so now, to be known for this and to get the ejector seat from my own organization, to lose my identity as a passionate young founder and CEO, to lose my identity as a wife, I felt like I had ruined God\u2019s calling for my life. I saw no reason to live anymore. I didn\u2019t want to live anymore. What saved my life was that shortly before my scandal went out across national media, I sent out a full disclosure letter, and at the time, we had 7,500 supporters \u2013 top CEOs, investors, and people I respected more than anyone in the world \u2013 and I said, \u201cI screwed up. I made these bad decisions. I\u2019m a divorced woman. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next in my life.\u201d Sending that letter was super painful for me, but within about 24 hours of sending it, my inbox filled up with nearly 1,000 emails of love, and support, and \u201cYou\u2019ve always preached grace and second chances,\u201d and \u201cWhat are you doing next with your life?\u201d If you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m an all-in person, and I had no Plan B, but it was people \u2013 Other human beings saw potential in me when I saw no potential in myself. I used to think, \u201cWhat happens to leaders like me who screw up? Is there some island for castaways? Do we all go serve Starbucks somewhere? What do we do?\u201d I had no vision for a better future. All I could see was dark clouds and no reason to live anymore. The fact that people saw potential and a future in me \u2013 and more than that, the fact that people \u2013 I took a year off after my resignation. I went through massive therapy \u2013 I\u2019d already been through massive therapy \u2013 and I went to leadership blowup camps where other CEOs and pastors go. I guess I wasn\u2019t the only person to screw up their life. When I went there, other people had the opportunity to care for me. I have these people I call my adopted parents, and they said, \u201cJust come stay with us for a while.\u201d I hardly knew these people at the time, and they said, \u201cWe will love you back to life.\u201d I had nothing to offer people. I learned for the first time \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. How did you meet these adoptive parents? Catherine Hoke: So, their names are Bill and Andrea Townsend. Bill is a serial entrepreneur who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, and he had sent PEP \u2013 my Texas organization \u2013 a big fat check, and I couldn\u2019t tell it was from him. I had to do a lot of due diligence to track down who it was from, which was weird, because usually, I know where the money is coming from. When I finally found out it was from him, I requested to meet with him, and as it turned out, I had a super short meeting with him in an airport for 30 minutes. When I met with him, he was like, \u201cThank you for the work you do.\u201d I was like, \u201cThank you for the big, fat check that you wrote me.\u201d He was like, \u201cNo, thank you for the work that you do.\u201d His whole demeanor was really different. He was thankful that I was serving the world and not everybody\u2019s like that about it. And then, what really struck me about that meeting with Bill \u2013 so, Bill loves God and grace, and he said, \u201cDo you serve people with sexual criminal histories?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, the Texas prison system won\u2019t allow us to serve that.\u201d I believe all things can be redeemed, and look \u2013 I\u2019m going to say this right now, Tim \u2013 nobody likes sexual crime, especially not me, having been a victim of that myself. Nobody likes that. But, if people with even ugly crimes don\u2019t have an opportunity to rehabilitate \u2013 those are the crimes that we don\u2019t want repeated in society, right? Anyway, Bill said to me, \u201cDo you serve people who have committed those crimes?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, because the Texas prison system won\u2019t let me.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, what if we started a different organization \u2013 a separate umbrella \u2013 that served those people?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, maybe that would be a nice thing to think about in the future.\u201d With a lot of my Texas donors, when they find out that I don\u2019t serve people with a certain crime category, they\u2019re relieved, they\u2019re so glad, and they sometimes tell me that they wouldn\u2019t fund me if I served those people, which always surprises me, because I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want those people rehabilitated?\u201d Anyway, I\u2019m deviating right now. Bill had a really different heart, and he had no reason to care about those people, but I think he cares about people who have been written off and stigmatized, and he and Andrea have this ability to see potential in anybody. It\u2019s like they see the world through these rose-colored glasses, and they\u2019re not na\u00efve human beings by any means. So, they were the first ones who called me after I sent out my resignation letter to 7,500 people, and I was drowning in shame, and self-hate, and disgust, and my phone rang. Bill had called me a half an hour later, and he said, \u201cSweetie, we love you. Come stay with us.\u201d I was like, \u201cWho are you? I\u2019m a scandalous, divorced woman with nothing to offer. I hardly know you. I\u2019ve never met your wife.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cCome stay with us and we\u2019ll love you back to life.\u201d Well, I had nothing to lose. I was at the bottom of myself, and I was willing to do anything, and I thought I was so gross that I said yes. There was a small group of amazing people who poured into me in that year and made me think that I still had potential. I tell my story all the time, so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so emotional right now, but it\u2019s because people saw something in me when I thought I had nothing left that I am such a believer in second chances \u2013 or, what I actually believe in now is legitimate first chances. Much of the world thinks that the people that I serve are so rotten or that they have no value, and I know better, and I know that hope is a cure for violence, and I know that they\u2019ve done such horrible, hurtful things. I know that for the most part, horrible, hurtful things have been done to them, and I know that unless there\u2019s some intervention \u2013 and, many people don\u2019t want to get their hands dirty and do this kind of work \u2013 unless there\u2019s some kind of intervention, this will be a generational legacy of incarceration, violence, crime, and drug abuse. It\u2019s a big, fat waste of taxpayer dollars, and it hurts more people. The solution that I\u2019ve come up with is not just business, but it\u2019s also about love, healing, and redemption. It works all day long, and it works with \u2013 when I start in a new prison system, I tell the commissioner of the prison system and the wardens, \u201cSend me to your hellhole. Send me to the worst of the worst \u2013 the guys who refuse to program.\u201d What I see time and time again is that no one is beyond redemption. Some people don\u2019t want to change, and those guys \u2013 I have nothing to talk to them about. If they want to be criminals, I tell them, \u201cGet out,\u201d because I don\u2019t cut for criminals. Nobody likes criminals. I hate criminals. I don\u2019t work with criminals. I work with people who take ownership of their past and who want a better future. Tim Ferriss: Thank you for that. Catherine Hoke: You\u2019re welcome Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m just chewing on all that. Catherine Hoke: Take your time. Tim Ferriss: Well, there are many questions, and I will ask them all, but I will start with one that\u2019s not related directly to the population you work with. It\u2019s much broader than that. When you talk to someone who is very unforgiving of themselves \u2013 and, let\u2019s just say there is some catalyzing event that they are ashamed of or that they find unbearable in themselves \u2013 the reason that this comes to mind is A). Historically, I\u2019ve been an absolute F-minus student at forgiving myself for anything, and I find that that is very often paired with hyper competitiveness in the sense that if you look at people who are successful athletes and highly competitive throughout school, high school, college or whatever it might be, it seems to very often be part and parcel of a package that includes a low level of forgiveness. You have very high standards for yourself, and in excess, that can be very damaging. So, when you interact with someone who has a very difficult time forgiving themselves, what are the recommendations that you make? What are the things that you say? What are the books that you recommend? It could go in any number of directions, but I\u2019ll leave it open-ended because that\u2019s all that comes to mind at the moment. What do you say to those people? Catherine Hoke: \u201cYou are not your past.\u201d As hard as it might be to believe, especially if you\u2019re currently suffering the consequences of your past decision, you are not your past. You are not one decision or five decisions that you\u2019ve made in your life. I don\u2019t just believe, I know that every one of us is capable of having a better future than we\u2019ve had in our past, but there are some steps that we need to take to live a better future. So, first of all, recognize that you are not your past, and that you are not that label, because if you keep calling yourself that, you\u2019re probably going to keep acting that way. That belief/expectation cycle \u2013 when we have a belief about ourselves, and we expect that that\u2019s going to be true about ourselves, and then we end up acting that way, and we have more experiences that just confirm that belief about ourselves. So, in prison, when our volunteers \u2013 including our CEOs \u2013 come in, I say, \u201cShare with your partner what your voice of shame is in your head \u2013 that tape of shame that keeps playing in your head. What does it say? Say it out loud.\u201d And, people regularly say the same thing, whether they\u2019re incarcerated or whether they\u2019re the CEO of a billion-dollar company. That voice is often, \u201cYou are not good enough. You are a failure. You are a sucky dad. You\u2019re a loser. You\u2019ll be just like your father.\u201d These are the same messages of shame. So, I don\u2019t know what your message of shame is, but start by identifying that. And then, I say, \u201cCan you believe that you talk to yourself this way? It\u2019s so ugly. Would you allow anyone else to walk up to you and be like, \u2018You\u2019re a loser. You will never amount to anything\u2019?\u201d I don\u2019t know anyone who has any ounce of dignity \u2013 or even who doesn\u2019t \u2013 who would allow another human being to walk up, get in their face, and say that, but many of us are not only tolerant of that voice of shame that we feed ourselves all day long, it\u2019s almost like we encourage it. We say, \u201cYeah, you are a loser,\u201d and we keep pounding that into our own brains. At Defy, we do something called Affirmations, and it\u2019s cheesy, and I tell our EITs, \u201cFake it \u2018til you make it. Pick your head up, and I want you belting this out at the top of your lungs like you\u2019re a proud army.\u201d And, they say things like, \u201cI am worthy of the love I am receiving. I am an entrepreneur. I forgive myself. I am forgiven.\u201d We have a whole list of affirmations. We also go through this exercise where they identify what is called self-limiting believes, like lies that we tell ourselves. The problem with this exercise is that sometimes, it\u2019s really hard to identify the log that is in our own eye, so sometimes, our friends can hear it come out. If I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to fail in this podcast with Tim\u201d \u2013 if I say that out loud, maybe a friend of mine can pick up on that and say, \u201cThat\u2019s one of your self-limiting beliefs.\u201d And then, we have them write out their self-freeing beliefs, and then we tell them to meditate on it every day \u2013 every morning \u2013 for a minimum of 30 days, and then read it aloud to somebody else. But, a lot of reversing the message of shame is what we say is a choice to forgive. What we teach at Defy is that forgiveness is not a feeling. You\u2019re not going to feel like forgiving yourself. Forgiveness is not something that we earn. There\u2019s no amount of good deeds that you can do to make up for your victims\u2019 pain or loss, and if you\u2019re waiting for that to happen, you\u2019re never going to get there. I ask questions like, \u201cWho would you be if you chose to forgive yourself? Why aren\u2019t you forgiving yourself, or why aren\u2019t you forgiving somebody else?\u201d I tell them, \u201cThink back to the most painful thing that has ever been done to you \u2013 the person who\u2019s offended you the most, or the person that you cannot forgive or refuse to forgive. \u201cWhen you think back to that incident, what are the feelings that brew in your heart?\u201d The answers are usually revenge, vengeance, hate, depression, pain \u2013 I\u2019ve never heard of a good thing. I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right, you have a choice here. Do you want to keep that big ball of hate all to yourself? Think of the last time that your hate decided for you. When we don\u2019t forgive ourselves or others, we live in the past.\u201d At Defy, our program is called CEO of Your New Life. We\u2019re all here, and Tim, I bet every one of your listeners is here because they want a better future. So, if you chose unforgiveness, you\u2019re choosing to be shackled by your past \u2013 your own past decisions or your feelings of negativity about somebody else \u2013 and the people I serve are physically incarcerated \u2013 their bodies are locked up \u2013 but we\u2019re the only ones who can incarcerate our minds and hearts. I know so many people on this side of the fence \u2013 who are not incarcerated \u2013 who live like they\u2019re locked up because you pound your brain with hateful messages that keep you from living your best. So, what I say is if you want forgiveness, it\u2019s actually quite simple. People say, \u201cOh, it sounds easier than it is.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s really simple. Say, \u201cI forgive myself\u201d or \u201cI forgive him.\u201d I\u2019m a super stubborn person, so I say, \u201cGet stubborn about forgiveness\u201d because if I say, \u201cI forgive me\u201d \u2013 like, \u201cI forgive me for my scandal\u201d \u2013 then two seconds later, my brain is going to shoot back, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, you loser. You suck\u201d \u2013 that whole negative message. So, if I get stubborn about forgiveness, I say, \u201cNo, brain. I forgive me. I forgive me. I forgive me.\u201d I say it over and over again. The next morning, I guarantee you that my stubborn is going to wake up and tell me how much I suck again, and I overpower it. It\u2019s not just me, but if I can find a friend who believes in grace and second chances, I can tell them, \u201cI\u2019m struggling with this. My brain is telling me how much I suck. Do you forgive me, even if I didn\u2019t offend you?\u201d If that person washes the dirty water in my own brain, it\u2019s pretty helpful. At Defy, I think a reason why our amazing CEOs \u2013 we have 4,400 volunteers, and I think people keep coming back to us because when they\u2019re there in prison with us \u2013 we have events outside of prison, too \u2013 people are part of a community that rallies around shared values of forgiveness and second chances. I don\u2019t care how fancy your credentials are. When you\u2019re in prison, you\u2019re just a human who has made mistakes, and even though you\u2019ve made those mistakes, you are lovable, you are acceptable, you are worthy, and you are good enough, and if you come with us, you\u2019re going to feel that in your bones. So, get stubborn about forgiveness. If there\u2019s one message I could share with the world, if there\u2019s one impact I could have, I don\u2019t think it would even be about prison. It would be, \u201cChoose forgiveness for yourself and for others who have hurt you. If you forgive them, one day, your feelings may catch up, but it might help you to reshape a whole new future.\u201d Tim Ferriss: You mentioned a few things that I\u2019d love to repeat for myself as much as anyone else and maybe explore a bit. The first is \u201cHope is a cure for violence.\u201d I think that\u2019s \u2013certainly true in many different senses, whether that is violence towards others or violence towards yourself. That violence towards yourself can just be the incessant, berating, self-loathing, and self-flagellation, which is something that I\u2019ve vastly improved in the last 6 to 12 months for a host of reasons that we don\u2019t have the bandwidth to get into right now, but that was the constant companion that I had for 20-35 years, whatever the total span of time was. I\u2019d also say that affirmations \u2013 as cheesy as they might sound, and people who are old enough to remember Stuart Smalley and the mirrors \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you remember that name at all, but, \u201cI\u2019m good enough, and gosh darn it, people like me.\u201d I think it was Saturday Night Live. I think it was Al Franken, now senator, right? Crazy. In any case, the fact of the matter is that many of the people I\u2019ve had on this podcast use affirmations in different forms. Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, is one example. He has used affirmations in many different ways over time and credits many of his biggest career successes to affirmations, so it\u2019s not just for entrepreneurs-in-training who you work with. There is a place for that. The next is something you didn\u2019t say, but it has been suggested by our mutual friend Seth that I ask you about it, and it\u2019s a quote. I don\u2019t know the context or the background, so maybe you can give it to me. \u201cYou can\u2019t be angry and curious at the same time.\u201d Catherine Hoke: Yeah, I learned that from a friend of mine named Dan Tocchini, who does some of the character development courses, but I\u2019ve seen that in my life. When I\u2019m angry, my brain seems to think it\u2019s really right about whatever I\u2019m angry about, and so, if I realize that my brain can\u2019t be angry and curious at the same time, if I choose to set aside my own judgments or need to be right, then I can ask questions, and a lot of what we do at Defy is working on creating empathy and understanding where the other side is coming from. It\u2019s amazing what a case I can build in my own brain, but then, when I start to understand the other person\u2019s pain or point of view, how wrong I can be. Tim Ferriss: What would be an example of a situation or a concrete example of an \u201cother side,\u201d just so we can conjure an image for people of what this looks like in action? Catherine Hoke: Any time I\u2019m in a fight or an argument with anybody. I\u2019m like, \u201cMy side is right because I believe this, and you\u2019re wrong, and my decision is the right way to go.\u201d Especially when I\u2019m making a decision that I think is based on a lot of experience or data, it\u2019s so easy for my brain to just jump to that conclusion, and that\u2019s arrogance. Sometimes, it\u2019s experience or whatever you can call it, but maybe I\u2019m completely missing something new about this situation, or maybe I\u2019m actually right about my conclusion or decision about a certain business situation, for example. But, maybe I\u2019m completely missing the way that I\u2019m making someone feel through my decision, and if the way that I\u2019m making that person feel is important to me, then maybe I should reconsider my course of action as well. Does that make sense? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it does make sense. I wanted to clarify one other thing you said earlier, which was the morning meditation on beliefs. Can you walk us through what your entrepreneurs-in-training are actually doing each morning? What does a session look like? Catherine Hoke: So, there are self-limiting beliefs, which is the negative tape that is playing in our brain whether we realize that tape is playing or not, and then, the exercise is to replace the self-limiting beliefs with self-freeing beliefs. Now, according to our course in self-limiting beliefs, these can be lies that we sometimes don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re telling ourselves because we adopted them through experiences that we might have had when we were 3 years old. We can have self-limiting beliefs about ourselves, about other people, about God \u2013 really, about anything. So, I\u2019ll give you an example. One of our EITs was telling me that when he was 3 years old, he was found by CPS in a dumpster. Tim Ferriss: Child Protective Services? Catherine Hoke: Child Protective Services literally found him in a dumpster, and that was in his file. So, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not, the self-limiting beliefs that could form out of being found in a dumpster could be, \u201cNobody loves me,\u201d \u201cI can never trust authorities,\u201d \u201cI do not belong,\u201d \u201cI was not wanted in the world,\u201d \u201cI am trash.\u201d There are so many self-limiting beliefs that could come out of that. If we never take a moment to realize the values that have shaped us and where they came from \u2013 because values are often just handed to through us through our parents, or a lack of parents, or religion, or culture. So, if that guy never stops to think about that, then he\u2019s now an adult man \u2013 30 years old \u2013 thinking, \u201cI am a piece of trash.\u201d Well, if we think that we\u2019re a piece of trash \u2013 and this relates to \u201chope is a cure for violence\u201d \u2013 if I think I\u2019m a piece of trash who will never amount to anything, why not just go do destructive things? Sometimes, if I do destructive things, I get attention for it, and sometimes hurting myself feels good. Sometimes, it makes me feel alive when I feel like I\u2019m not worth of living anyway, so I\u2019ll continue to hurt other people and throw myself away because from what I learned, my dad was in prison, too, and I belong in this place. Well, if that guy is able to replace these values with positive ones that he can find from a program like Defy, that he can find from positive friends, that he can find from most religions universally, like \u201cMy life matters,\u201d \u201cI can have a purpose \u2013\u201d What we tell people when they\u2019re writing their self-freeing beliefs is if you go from a self-limiting belief to an unrealistic self-freeing belief, then you\u2019re feeding yourself something that your brain is never going to believe. For example, say you\u2019re not a very good-looking human being and your self-limiting belief is, \u201cI am ugly; therefore, I will never get a date.\u201d Well, if you replace that with a self-freeing belief of, \u201cI\u2019m a supermodel and I can date anyone I want,\u201d your brain will know that you\u2019re trying to trick yourself, and it\u2019s not going to be effective. But, if you replace that with a self-freeing belief that says, \u201cI have some really nice features, and I know that some people will appreciate me for who I am, and I have a great personality; therefore, I am capable of finding love in my life.\u201d I just made that up on the spot, but that\u2019s a much more realistic version than \u201cI\u2019m a supermodel.\u201d So, if the person who was found in a dumpster replaces his self-limiting belief with, \u201cI know that I matter to some people in life, and I don\u2019t matter to everybody, but I\u2019m okay even when some people don\u2019t see my value because I do have a community of people who see value in me,\u201d and, for example, their Defy mentors and fellow EITs reinforce that message for them, that\u2019s a reality that can change your life and your future. If you think that you matter in the world, and that you\u2019re not a piece of trash, and if you say, \u201cI have the ability to develop skills and an education that will land me a job. I have the ability to not only stay out of prison, but to start a legal business that will thrive. I know that I am in a program that supports me toward my goals,\u201d then you\u2019re actually going to start working that way. And, when you meditate on that every single morning \u2013 and, 30 days is not enough to reverse a lifetime of negative brain trash and experiences that back up the brain trash \u2013 if you meditate on that, you might actually see that become true for you. So, I\u2019ve done this in my own life, and I\u2019ve seen so many of my own lies in my head turn. For example, some of our male EITs were abandoned by their mother, who is a drug addict, or they were cheated on by their girlfriends or their wives, so they\u2019re like, \u201cI will never trust another woman.\u201d So, that\u2019s a self-limiting belief, and I say, \u201cHow has that been serving you in your life?\u201d A self-freeing belief that might replace that is, \u201cI have developed judgment and discernment to know that there are some people who will not have my best interests at heart, but there are other people that I can trust and am willing to trust.\u201d So, that\u2019s a more mature, self-freeing belief that might lead to other opportunities in our lives. Tim Ferriss: And, when you say \u201cmeditate on it\u201d in the morning, is that reading a list over and over again for a set period of time? Catherine Hoke: Yup. Great questions. Tim Ferriss: Is it reading them out loud? Is it memorizing them? What is it? Catherine Hoke: Yes, yes. Reading it to yourself is great. Reading it quietly is nice. Reading it aloud is better. And then, we have them partner up, and then we have a partner pound it into their brain. So, have someone say it to you with conviction. One of our EITs said something I love. \u201cNow, every morning, when I wake up, I look in the mirror, and I say, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d What would all of us in this world \u2013 who would we be if we woke up every morning and we said in the mirror with conviction, \u201cI love you, I believe in you, you can do it, today will be awesome\u201d? If we actually believe that about ourselves, we have no idea how much we\u2019re capable of, how many good and beautiful acts we\u2019re capable of. Tim Ferriss: Hear, hear. What are some of the ingredients that make Defy uniquely \u2013 not necessary unique, because that implies that all of the rest are not \u2013 but, uniquely effective or effective? I\u2019ll give you an example. You don\u2019t need the time, but I\u2019ll buy some time anyway, and I\u2019ll use a different environment. I went to my first Tony Robbins event about three or four years ago, \u201cUnleash the Power Within.\u201d There are many things that you do during this event. There\u2019s the fire walk, there are many different practices, exercises, partner drills, jumping up and down \u2013 you name it. It\u2019s like rave plus Pentecostal church plus Tony Robbins, for whom I have an extremely high degree of respect and admiration. I\u2019ve gotten to know him over the past couple of years. All of that said, you have many different tools in the toolkit that are presented, and one of them is something called the Dickens Process, which I won\u2019t get into right now, but that exercise is the reason one of my friends, who is a very successful CEO, has gone to \u201cUnleash the Power\u201d 10 or 11 times. It\u2019s primarily on an annual basis to have Tony lead this exercise called the Dickens Process. Now that I think about it, it\u2019s specifically to identify self-limiting beliefs and replace them. What are some of the tools in the toolkit or the ingredients that make Defy effective? Catherine Hoke: Our volunteers regularly say that our \u201cStep to the Line\u201d exercise is one of the most eye-opening, profound experiences \u2013 not just of Defy, but of their lives. We build empathy through it. Some of our volunteers have said that it\u2019s like free therapy. We talk about forgiveness at the line. \u201cStep to the line if you haven\u2019t forgiven yourself. Step to the line if you haven\u2019t forgiven someone else.\u201d I issue a challenge like, \u201cStep to the line if not forgiving yourself or others is still hurting you to this day,\u201d and then, to everyone at the line, I say, \u201cYou know what time it is now. Choose. \u2018I forgive me.\u2019\u201d So, \u201cStep to the Line\u201d is a really powerful exercise, and it\u2019s not just for our volunteers. For our entrepreneurs-in-training, we create an incredibly emotional and physical safe place, even in prison, even in a maximum-security prison, where people can let their tough-guy or -girl guards down and just be human, and be seen, loved, and accepted for who they are. I think that\u2019s something that all of us want in life, is to be seen and known, and to not have to put up a fa\u00e7ade. It\u2019s so relaxing when we actually realize that we can just be us, and \u201cI am good enough.\u201d So, \u201cStep to the Line\u201d is a really special, unique ingredient of what we do that is empathy-inducing and grace-inducing. And then, we do a lot of other things. So, at Defy events, we do the Worm, where we go up and down. We get legally high in prison. It\u2019s actually a lot of fun. We do something called the \u201cInnovative Dance,\u201d where you have to get from one side of the sweaty gym to the other using an innovative move. A lot of our volunteers are 40- and 50-year-old white dudes who have no dance moves, but \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It must be an amazing scene to behold. Catherine Hoke: It is really wonderful. We tell the guys in prison, \u201cTwerk at your own risk. Ladies, keep below the waist immobile.\u201d It\u2019s not totally equal opportunity in a guys\u2019 prison. So, they don\u2019t have to be good dance moves. We say, \u201cKeep them rated G for \u2018goofy,\u2019\u201d but we use a lot of fun emotion and intensity, and then we use our love of the entrepreneurial journey to bring out the best in people, so everything we do at Defy \u2013 not everything, but almost everything \u2013 is super competitive, and our EITs are delivering these Shark Tank pitches, and the volunteers are giving feedback, and it brings out the best in people. And then, we turn the tables. I\u2019m big on leveling the playing field all the time. Sometimes, these fancy CEOs and VCs come to prison, and they\u2019re going to be the Shark Tank judges. That\u2019s great. Well, at one point in the day, the EITs all get voting tickets, and I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right, the judges have been voting on your business ideas all day long. Now, it\u2019s the EITs\u2019 turn. So, volunteers, get your toes at the line.\u201d They all line up at this stretchy line of duct tape through the gym, and I tell them, \u201cPut your hands up with your best beggar\u2019s body language with puppy-dog eyes, language that says, \u2018Choose me!\u2019\u201d Then, the EITs go, and they have ten tickets, and there are sometimes 70 volunteers in the gym, and they walk up to the volunteer, look them in the eyeballs, and they say, \u201cTim, I choose you,\u201d and that\u2019s all they\u2019re allowed to say. And then, the volunteers compete for who gets the most tickets and we see who the top volunteer is. We tell the EITs, \u201cPick the ones who were the best judges, who gave the best feedback.\u201d So, when the volunteers don\u2019t get as many tickets, I say, \u201cLook, you can say the system is rigged, and you can suck your thumb the whole bus ride home and say you hate Defy, or \u2013 just like we say at Defy \u2013 you can use the feedback to up your game, come back, and be a better judge the next time around.\u201d And so, a big thing that we do at Defy \u2013 we are a nonprofit organization. We work with people who have been through a lot of things, who have done a lot of things, but one of our driving values is \u201cPartner not pity.\u201d If you come to prison with us, Tim \u2013 or anybody else \u2013 you will see. When I lead an event, I instruct people, \u201cYou are not to feel sorry for anyone here. This is not some Hug a Thug event to come and feel sorry for these guys. Look at them in the eye with respect and empathy.\u201d That is so empowering, awesome, fun, and magical. Our volunteers leave prison and it leaves a real mark on them. It gives them something to think about for their own lives, and many of our volunteers leave saying, \u201cWow, I can be doing so much more.\u201d They feel inspired by the drive of our amazing EITs. So, our events are super high-energy. I like to think we\u2019re a little Tony Robbins-esque. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s part of the reason I brought him up. There\u2019s certainly some shared DNA. Catherine Hoke: I\u2019m a big fan. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s an impressive, very effective guy. I did want to revisit one thing you mentioned because it caught my eye when I was reading the \u201cAbout Us\u201d page on defyventures.org, and it is the following: \u201cDefy offers a suite of services that includes intensive personal and leadership development, competition-based entrepreneurship training, executive mentoring, financial investment, and business incubation.\u201d Can you talk a little bit more \u2013 we don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time on it, but \u201ccompetition-based\u201d is very interesting to me. Why \u201ccompetition-based,\u201d and how do you do it right versus not do it right? Catherine Hoke: Well, I\u2019m a competitor, and I believe that competition \u2013 done the right way \u2013 can bring out the best in all of us. And so, when we have 100 EITs in prison \u2013 by the way, we also run these competitions outside of prison for real business ideas. Inside prison, it\u2019s an ideation competition, and outside prison, there are actual incorporated businesses that are competing for real capital. Inside prison, when we have 100 guys who are competing, we ask them the night before, \u201cWho\u2019s going to win?\u201d All these guys raise their hands. First of all, the people that we work with are very competitive, tough, and like to win, and many of the people that we work with \u2013 if I tell them, \u201cI bet you can\u2019t do it,\u201d they\u2019ll puff their chest out, and they\u2019ll do it, and they\u2019ll defy a lot of odds. So, we make sure that we have the affirmation. We tell them, \u201cI know you can do it.\u201d Sometimes, there are people who are lacking in confidence, and we go a long way to reassure them and tell them that they can do it. We also tell them, \u201cWhen you\u2019re competing tomorrow in our pitch competition, this is not just about you. This is about what we\u2019re doing in our country. Other people wish that they could be you right now, participating in Defy.\u201d We get stacks of jail mail at Defy from all over the country from people who say, \u201cPlease, all I want is a second chance.\u201d So, they all want to win the competition, and we have quarterfinals, semifinals, and then we have finals, and the Top 5 finalists get these IOU checks from this stage that they get to cash out when they\u2019re admitted into our post-release incubator when they want to start their actual business if they want to. I don\u2019t care if they want to start their business. We get them into jobs when they get out of prison, and that\u2019s why we have a 95 percent employment rate. But, the night before, when we\u2019re at a pitch practice, and the guys are so nervous about the competition, and some of them \u2013 the first time we ever had a competition in prison for Defy, the warden called the night before and said, \u201cCan you come in here? These guys are having anxiety attacks and they\u2019re crying.\u201d At this particular prison, more than half of the guys had committed the crime of murder, so these are tough guys. I walked in there like, \u201cWhat? You guys are crying and thinking about dropping out? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a bunch of chickens now. When you robbed that bank, or did this or that, you didn\u2019t let your fear stop you from doing what you wanted to do.\u201d And, I\u2019m playing with them, and they laugh, but then I tell them, \u201cI believe in you, I know you can do this, and I know that for the past year\u201d \u2013 Defy takes about a year to complete inside, and they take 100 courses, and some of these courses are taught by Harvard and Stanford MBA professors, and some are taught by therapists that are doing deep inner work, and it\u2019s this whole journey. When they finish it, they earn \u2013 our curriculum has been vetted by Baylor University\u2019s MBA program. So, the next day, they\u2019re about to receive a Baylor University MBA program certificate. Our men, women, and youth that we serve average an eighth-grade education. So, I tell them the day before, \u201cFor many of you, this is the biggest accomplishment of your lives. Raise your hand if this represents the biggest accomplishment of your life.\u201d 90 percent of them raise their hand. \u201cRaise your hand if this is going to be your first time in a cap and gown.\u201d For half of them, it\u2019s the first time in a cap and gown. \u201cRaise your hand if your family is coming tomorrow to witness your proudest moment.\u201d Half of them \u2013 not all of our families can make it. And then, I tell them, \u201cGuess what? I know that for the past year, you have been working on your pitch,\u201d but only about 20 or 30 percent of Defy\u2019s program is around entrepreneurship and their pitch. The other 70 percent is around employment readiness, shame reduction, forgiveness, technology skills, parenting courses and all that. So, I tell them, \u201cAlthough you\u2019ve been working for the past year on your pitch, and you feel like your life is on the line, guess what? Your life is not on the line. Tomorrow, if you fail in your pitch, you are not a failure. More than that, I do not care about your pitch.\u201d They all kind of look at me. They feel offended when I say that. \u201cI really don\u2019t care about your pitch. I care about you, and I care about your future, and I have given so many pitches in my life, and sometimes I give a great one, and sometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, I bombed that,\u2019 and your pitch doesn\u2019t matter. You and your future are what matter, and you are arriving to this moment of graduation, and you are crossing the stage and earning your MBA certificate, making your families proud, and making yourself proud. You have defied the odds. \u201cHow many of you have thought about quitting at some point in Defy?\u201d Every hand goes up. I\u2019m like, \u201cSee? Sometimes you guys say that quitting is not an option. Guess what? Quitting is always an option. You just chose not to take that option. I am proud of you. I am proud of what we are accomplishing together. Our country needs to see more success stories like yours of people who have made grave mistakes and who are getting back on their feet and trying again. You could have given up on yourselves, you could have given up on your future, and you could give up on being a father going forward. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll tell you what: I care about your pitch because I care about you. I really don\u2019t care about your pitch, but because you want to win and you\u2019re competitive, tough guys, I care about your pitch. So, when you stand up tomorrow, there is going to be a panel of five to ten of these sharks. First of all, these sharks want you to win. They\u2019re coming here because they believe in second chances and underdogs. \u201cWhen you stand up in front of the panel, what\u2019s the worst thing that could happen?\u201d They\u2019re pretty funny. They\u2019re like, \u201cI pass out,\u201d or \u201cI forget my words,\u201d or \u201cI freeze up,\u201d or \u201cI look stupid.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat\u2019s worse than that?\u201d One of them once said, \u201cI defecate myself.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, that would suck. But, the worst thing that would probably happen is that maybe you freeze up and forget some of your words. If you stand up in front of the panel and just go, \u2018Uhhhh,\u2019 and can\u2019t think of a single word, you still win. You graduate. You cross the stage. You make yourself proud. You make our country proud.\u201d And then, they graduate, and they deliver their pitches in an amazing way every time. They surprise themselves with what they\u2019re able to do. Tim Ferriss: Is there a place where people can learn more about the curriculum that you use? Catherine Hoke: Yeah. Our website, defyventures.org \u2013 we\u2019re a nonprofit \u2013 has a lot of information about Defy. So, we have 100 courses inside, 100 courses outside, and with our donors, we even share some of our online courses, which are amazing. So, in prison, people don\u2019t usually have online access, so our courses are DVD-based. Outside, they\u2019re on an online platform, so for our donors, we are even able to share them because I tell our volunteers, \u201cI don\u2019t just want our guys to forgive themselves and be the CEOs of their new lives, I want you to live your fullest life, too.\u201d So, we\u2019re happy. Sharing is caring. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m looking at the Resources section on defyventures.org right now. What about the actual classes themselves, those that have been vetted by Baylor and so on, the actual content of what you are teaching? Is that available anywhere? Catherine Hoke: We don\u2019t just make it available to anybody. For example, some of our courses that are taught by Henry Cloud, a top therapist, or the Harvard and Stanford MBA courses \u2013 Harvard and Stanford don\u2019t want us just making that available to anybody. It\u2019s available to people who are in our program, so I guess you have to go commit a felony first. But, most of our courses don\u2019t actually have those kinds of restrictions on them, and we\u2019re happy to make those available to people, but my little hook is, \u201cI want you doing something for second chances in our country. So, don\u2019t just come and take a course. Become a contributor, too.\u201d If you become a contributor to Defy, we would be glad to make our \u2013 we make our courses available on our online platform where you have to have the secret code, but we make our online courses available because I want our volunteers to have access to this amazing stuff, too. For example, we have eight courses in etiquette training taught by an Emily Post instructor, and many of our volunteers have told me, \u201cIs there any way that my husband can get access to those courses?\u201d I say, \u201cSure, if you\u2019ll make him watch them.\u201d So, yes, we\u2019d be glad to share the resources. Tim Ferriss: Cool. Just to come back to something you mentioned in passing as we were chatting, if I were ever to join you at a prison \u2013 I\u2019m happy to do that, so we can figure out the specifics of that visit at some point \u2013 I think it\u2019d be very helpful to \u2013 Catherine Hoke: Is that a commitment, Tim? Did I just hear that? Is that something that\u2019s going to get cut out? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that\u2019s a commitment. Sure. Catherine Hoke: Tim Ferriss comes to prison with your hundred closest friends who sign up from this podcast. Love it. Tim Ferriss: Yes, we\u2019ll figure out the specifics of that. I do think \u2013 I want people to know what Cat just did there. That\u2019s a very seasoned pitch artist at work closing the deal. Catherine Hoke: I\u2019ve got sales skills. Tim Ferriss: Even just having the names of the courses that you\u2019re incorporating from Stanford, GSB, and elsewhere would be a very useful way to drive traffic to your site, also. Catherine Hoke: I will make sure that we update our website before this podcast is launched. Tim Ferriss: Perfect, so people can check it out. Catherine Hoke: Seth Godin has taught multiple courses for us on ideation strategies. Jerry Colonna has taught a course on the fear of the entrepreneur and how to get to the other side of that. Union Square venture capitalists \u2013 we\u2019ve recorded live pitches of our released men and women pitching in their offices and the feedback that we\u2019re giving to entrepreneurs. Tim Draper has taught a course for us. Kleiner Perkins \u2013 one of the partners from there \u2013 has recorded a course. So, we have amazing courses in entrepreneurship that range from how to come up with a smart business idea to how to scale it. We have courses in how to market your business, hiring and firing, and culture. But, the other 70 percent of our courses are on parenting \u2013 for example, how to answer tough questions, like when your kid asks you, \u201cDaddy, have you ever used drugs?\u201d, what you should say about that. So, the parenting courses and the \u201cforming a new identity\u201d courses are really valuable. I also like to think that our employment series is pretty sweet. I teach a course called \u201cHow to Write a R\u00e9sum\u00e9 When You\u2019ve Done 19 Years in Prison,\u201d and the creative things that you can come up with to put on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without lying about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would imagine the Additional Skills or Special Skills section could be very improvised. With the time that we have remaining, let me jump into a number of questions that I like to ask towards the tail end of a conversation like this. Catherine Hoke: Can you ask me about the book? Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I\u2019m going to get there. So, the first question I was going to ask you, which is going to naturally lead there, is what books have you gifted the most to other people? Or, do you regularly give books to other people? Catherine Hoke: I regularly give books to other people, and up until recently, the book that I have most regularly gifted is Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book Option B because it\u2019s closely related to the work that I do, and Sheryl is the most inspiring woman that I know. I really respect her. She\u2019s on my executive council. I love her book Option B on healing and building a new future. I feel very spoiled that Sheryl wrote the forward to my own book, which is called A Second Chance. So, now, the book that I\u2019m gifting even more than Option B is my own book, A Second Chance. Tim Ferriss: Where can people find that? Catherine Hoke: Amazon. And, Seth Godin has been working as my pro bono publisher. Every dollar from the book goes directly to creating life-changing opportunities for people through scholarships for Defy, so it\u2019s not going into a publisher\u2019s pocket. Speaking of gifting, Seth is buying and has donated 20,000 copies of the book back to Defy. He\u2019s so generous to us, and I\u2019m really inspired by his generosity, and Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s generosity, and the way that they have supported our second chance work. I hope that this book \u2013 yes, it will open the eyes of people about topics that we\u2019ve been talking about for the incarcerated, but my greater purpose for the readers of this book, A Second Chance, is that they will decide to give themselves a second chance. I talk a lot about forgiveness, like we\u2019ve talked about, Tim, that you will choose to forgive or give a second chance to other people in your life, or if you know other people who have made big mistakes who are down on themselves, that you\u2019ll use this book as a resource for them to achieve freedom as well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. The context in which Seth first reached out to me was related to the book, so I encourage everybody to check it out for sure \u2013 A Second Chance. Catherine Hoke: The idea is if people who have royally screwed up their lives and the lives of other people can forgive themselves and gain forgiveness from other people, get back on their feet, start legal businesses, and build an incredibly successful new future, you can do it, too. Many of us suffer from this shame of \u201cMine is worse than yours.\u201d \u201cOh, if you really knew what I did, mine is worse.\u201d \u201cMine is not recoverable.\u201d That\u2019s a message that plays inside our heads, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true. Yours isn\u2019t worse. You\u2019re human, and you can bounce back, too. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s also not helpful, if that makes sense. Even if it is worse, it\u2019s the replaying of that story. Using that as your defining narrative is not going to help create the future that you want to have. Catherine Hoke: Right. You have a choice. You can keep yourself locked up in your head over a past decision forever or we can help you to get out of your own prison. It\u2019s your choice. Tim Ferriss: Yup. If you could have a message on a billboard \u2013 metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions of people \u2013 it could be one line, not an advertisement, but just a word, expression, or quote from someone else, what would you put on that billboard? Catherine Hoke: It can\u2019t be an advertisement, so I can\u2019t say, \u201cGive me all your money. Show me the money.\u201d I would say, \u201cForgive yourself,\u201d and maybe I would put it in Vegas, but I think a better place than Vegas would be \u2013 I have a big heart for people who live in a culture of judgment and oppression. Sometimes, well-meaning religions, for example, can create this environment where we can say that we\u2019ve sinned in the past, or we\u2019ve made a mistake in the past, but now, when we show up at church on Sunday, we\u2019re all wearing the perfect outfit \u2013 \u201cHow\u2019s your wife?\u201d \u201cBlessed.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s your job?\u201d \u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cHow are you?\u201d \u201cHappy.\u201d There\u2019s a culture of oppression. I believe that sin thrives in secrecy. If there\u2019s an audience, I say, \u201cForgive yourself. You\u2019re just human.\u201d It\u2019s especially in environments where people are forced to act as if they\u2019re more perfect than others. For example, that might be in the Deep South, where there\u2019s religion. It might be at Stanford Business School, where everyone has to be the A-plus student, too, and has to be the very best. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. What do you do when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, or temporarily unfocused, or that you\u2019ve lost your focus \u2013 when you\u2019ve lost your mooring, so to speak \u2013 any of the above? What do you do in a practical, tactical sense Catherine Hoke: It depends on how overwhelmed I\u2019m feeling. If I\u2019m feeling sort of overwhelmed, then I\u2019ll make a list of my priorities, and I will bounce them off of a staff member that I really trust to help me to get my priorities straight because when I have clear marching orders and priorities, it helps me to be less overwhelmed. Tim Ferriss: When you say \u201cbounce them off of them,\u201d what are you asking them to do? What does that look like? Catherine Hoke: I\u2019ll show them the list and say, \u201cCan you help me decide what is really important and what I can say no to?\u201d Sometimes, the more overwhelmed I get, the worse I become as a decision-maker, and things can get cloudy. So, I recently read the book Essentialism, and I loved the little framework for making decisions, and I shared that with some staff that helps me to control my calendar, and opportunities, and what to say yes or no to. So, if I get overwhelmed, I\u2019ll say, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s take a step back.\u201d I also have a one-sheet with my priorities right in front of me, and I look at it every day, and it says, for example \u2013 my favorite place to be is in prison because I love the journey, transformation, and amazing \u2013 I feel like I see miracles every day. But, my sheet says, \u201cIf I really love our EITs, my strict No. 1 responsibility will be fundraising so that I can make sure that I\u2019m creating more opportunities for people who are incarcerated who have been praying for a shot at a second chance.\u201d So, I keep my priorities, not just at the top of my mind, but physically in front of me. I need to be able to see it. And then, I\u2019ll ask other people for help. I\u2019ll say, \u201cTime out.\u201d When I get super overwhelmed, I\u2019ll actually take a time out and cancel stuff. I need to have some space. Monthly, I take what I call a Monk Day, with no phone and no email. It\u2019s one of the best things I do. I recommend it to everybody. Tim Ferriss: Does that typically fall on a certain day of the week? Catherine Hoke: No. It can be any day, but it\u2019s during the week. I don\u2019t do it during the weekend. It\u2019s a time for me to reflect on my leadership, my priorities, and my new initiatives. It\u2019s when I get creative. My whole life is so extroverted. I travel all the time, I\u2019m speaking on a stage, I\u2019m in prison, and my life is like a flurry. And so, quiet reflective time is deeply important to me, and it\u2019s usually when I scheme up good, exciting ideas and get perspective. Tim Ferriss: When you wake up on Monk Day, what does it look like? What does reflecting actually look like? What does the monk schedule look like? Catherine Hoke: For me, Monk Day is just like working out. The process leading up to it is really painful because I know that for a full day \u2013 this sounds silly \u2013 I\u2019m not going to email or be able to talk to people, so the day before, I\u2019m trying to squeeze in every last thing. With a workout, I\u2019m usually procrastinating and trying to put it off until I start working out, and then I feel really good about it. I try to make excuses for why I need to cancel it, but it\u2019s very important for me to stay disciplined, so I come into my Monk Day with a list of things that I\u2019m going to do in that Monk Day, which might include, \u201cGo for a long walk,\u201d or \u201cRead this book,\u201d or \u201cThink about this issue.\u201d And so, my email is off, my phone is off, my staff knows they can\u2019t reach me, and I usually do something that is really nice to me to start off the day. Tim Ferriss: Like what? Catherine Hoke: Eat my favorite food, or \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s one of your favorite foods? I\u2019m going to keep doing this. Catherine Hoke: Sure. I don\u2019t eat it in the morning, but an awesome medium rare steak is my favorite food. Steak, oysters, red wine \u2013 I\u2019m a happy camper. I usually don\u2019t eat that for breakfast. I love poached eggs. How\u2019s that? Tim Ferriss: Perfect. Catherine Hoke: But, when I do something that\u2019s kind to myself \u2013 sometimes, on a Monk Day, I\u2019ll even go get a massage because it chills me out, and normally, I\u2019m super hyper. I wake up like a crazy honey badger first thing in the morning. Or, if I take a bubble bath, that calms my spirit, too. I play sweet violin music. I actually have baby lullabies on my playlist. That probably sounds really creepy, but \u2013 I do things to quiet myself. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m just imagining you eating a medium rare steak and drinking red wine while the lullabies are playing. Catherine Hoke: There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Stop judging me. Tim Ferriss: \u00a0\u2013while doing a concentration curl with one arm. Catherine Hoke: I also have a walking treadmill desk, and I absolutely love it because I feel like when I\u2019m on it, I\u2019m being kind to myself. I\u2019m burning free calories and I like to be fit and work out. Sometimes, the first thing I\u2019ll do on a Monk Day is get on my walking treadmill desk with a book that I love to read, and I just start reading it, and I start taking notes, and I have these awesome headphones, so I\u2019m blaring my little, nerdy violin or piano music, and it calms me, and it takes me out of the world, and then I start taking notes. Right before I turned 40, I had a series of really amazing Monk Days, and I spent the last six months of Monk Days before I turned 40 doing an in-depth evaluation and review of my first 40 years, thinking about my impact of the world, and thinking about what I wanted my voice and impact to be for the next 40 years. And, I didn\u2019t make turbo plans for my 80th birthday or anything, but I have a pretty strong plan until I\u2019m 53, and that\u2019s far enough for me. But, I felt so good about taking that time out to evaluate and say, \u201cWhat do I really want?\u201d, and then, reading a lot of books to help guide me in that direction. So, I like to have a good plan because I\u2019m like a freight train, and if I have the right direction, I hit it in that direction. And then, after my day off, I bounce my plans off of mentors and people who look out for me to make sure that I\u2019m making good plans. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any suggested artist, album, or track for either violin or piano music, for people who want to get a taste? Catherine Hoke: Oh, my gosh. I\u2019m looking for it right now. Tim Ferriss: Okay. While you\u2019re looking for it, I can keep going. Catherine Hoke: Look up \u201cbaby lullaby piano\u201d on Spotify or something like that. Tim Ferriss: Okay, perfect. Catherine Hoke: And, I love the Vitamin String Quartet as well Tim Ferriss: Vitamin? Catherine Hoke: Vitamin String Quartet. Tim Ferriss: Vitamin like Vitamin C? Catherine Hoke: Yeah. I want to go to one of their concerts. Tim Ferriss: Trippy. And then \u2013 Catherine Hoke: Sometimes, their songs are not the most relaxing. They play a lot of pop songs in Vitamin form, but sometimes I listen to that while I\u2019m cooking. I like to sew a lot, too, so while I\u2019m sewing, I jam out to Vitamin String Quartet. Tim Ferriss: How often do you do Monk Days? So, on the Monk Days leading up to your 40th birthday, what was the interval? Catherine Hoke: So, I have a personal Monk Day once a month, and I\u2019ve done this for 12 or 15 years \u2013 a long time in my life. It\u2019s been a longstanding habit. And then, I have separate business Monk Days. So, a personal Monk Day is no email or phone. On a business Monk Day, I can have email and work on work stuff with some of my closest colleagues, but I have no scheduled appointments, which is freedom for me because my calendar is usually scheduled too insanely. But, on a business Monk Day, it\u2019s time for me to just work and get work done with staff. I answer emails, too. And, I have one to three of those per month. Tim Ferriss: One to three per month? Catherine Hoke: In an ideal world \u2013 and, I say \u201cideally\u201d because I haven\u2019t executed perfectly on this \u2013 but sometimes, every quarter, I\u2019ll take a three-day business Monk Day, and I\u2019ve sometimes even gone away for a weeklong business Monk Day, meaning no scheduled appointments.What I\u2019ve found to be most effective for me \u2013 this might sound silly, but when I get out of the country \u2013 so, I go to Mexico by myself, I sit my butt at a cool resort, and for some reason, when I\u2019m out of the country, I won\u2019t schedule appointments or phone calls with other people, so I just work. At Defy, we\u2019re currently working on 2,400 pages of new curriculum, so it\u2019s a time for me to get away, but it\u2019s a dedicated work time away from the daily scramble. Tim Ferriss: What books helped you when you were leading up to your 40th birthday in the assessing or reassessing, planning, and so on? Closely related to that, why did the planning take you to exactly 53 years old? Catherine Hoke: So, I\u2019m terrible at randomly recalling the names of the books that I love. I will say that the book Essentialism really had a big impact on me. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a good book. I\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 we can work backwards. Why 53 years? Catherine Hoke: My vision for Defy is that it will serve in every major prison in America \u2013 defined as having more than 500 incarcerated people there \u2013 and every major city within my lifetime. So, I started modeling on the back of an envelope \u2013 a little Excel was involved \u2013 on a reasonable growth rate for what we can accomplish, and according to my projections, if we keep going \u2013 as of 2017, Defy is in five state prison systems, so by the time I\u2019m 53, I think we can serve in every major prison and have a corresponding post-release employment and mentoring incubator. So, if I miss the mark and I\u2019m 58, that\u2019s fine, but right now, I actually believe that we\u2019ll make it by the time I\u2019m 53. My vision \u2013 I would love to put Defy out of business by ending mass incarceration. I know that there will always be incarceration in the world. There doesn\u2019t always need to be mass incarceration the way that we do that in America. Tim Ferriss: What would be the defining characteristics of getting rid of mass incarceration as you\u2019re using the term? Catherine Hoke: So, America has 5 percent of the world\u2019s population and 22 percent of the world\u2019s prison population. We love to lock people up and throw away the key. We are the only country in the world that routinely sentences children to life in prison. So, we have a 14-year-old who makes a bad decision, and then they\u2019re going to die in prison. According to everything I\u2019ve seen, five years in prison is a turning point for many people. After they\u2019ve served five years, that\u2019s long enough to take ownership and not recidivate, and there are other countries that are far more progressive about rehabilitation efforts and not just making it about punishment, but about being corrected. So, I am looking forward to the day when 76.6 percent of people in prison don\u2019t recidivate, but beyond preventing recidivism and generational incarceration \u2013 since 70 percent of the children of incarcerated people go to prison \u2013 the other piece of this that I want to tackle is the way that we sentence people and even the way that we arrest people. So, in our country, some people look more arrestable than others because of the color of their skin, their economic status, or how beat up their car is. A lot of studies show that white people and black people use and sell drugs at the same rate, but in some states, if you\u2019re a person of color, you\u2019ll be sentenced to 20 times the amount of time to which a white person might be sentenced. The Brock Turner case \u2013 the cute little Stanford swimmer boy who raped a girl and got six months \u2013 if he were not so cute, or so white, or such a fast swimmer, he would have gotten life in prison. And so, I look forward to working on sentencing reform efforts and bail and bond reform efforts. Right now, if you\u2019re picked up by the police, you haven\u2019t been given due process, your bail is $500.00, and you\u2019re sitting in jail and you can\u2019t prove your innocence because you don\u2019t have an attorney, you\u2019re going to sit there for maybe six months until they wear you out, and then they convince you to plead guilty to a charge. If you don\u2019t have economic resources to get a good attorney, you\u2019re probably going to plead guilty, and they\u2019ll tell you, \u201cIf you plead guilty to this lesser felony or misdemeanor, it won\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d In six months, maybe your girlfriend has left you, your employer has dropped you, the world has changed, and by the way, now you have a criminal history. Good luck getting a job. And, you\u2019re super down on yourself because you just spent six months waiting in a cell, getting dehumanized every single day. For people of color in particular, that\u2019s the kind of harshness they deal with. The disparities in sentencing are something that I want to be able to use not just my voice or opinions, but Defy\u2019s results and amazing community of supporters, to fix it. Tim Ferriss: Well, I\u2019ve been very impressed with Defy, and the story, and certainly, the results, which are the first thing that I look at, so I do encourage people to check out A Second Chance, and that\u2019ll be linked to in the show notes, which I\u2019ll remind people of shortly. I want to come back for a second to ask you a question. What questions do you ask yourself to help you get centered or focused? I\u2019ll buy time by bringing up one that is a paraphrase from Jerry Colonna. I\u2019ve spent a good amount of time with Jerry on the phone, and one of the questions he asks that I\u2019ve found very helpful and insightful \u2013 which I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to be mangling a little bit \u2013 is \u201cHow are you complicit in the conditions that you say you don\u2019t want?\u201d So, how are you contributing to the things you say you don\u2019t want, whether those are conflicting goals, conflicting priorities, goals you have without any accountability \u2013 whatever it might be? But, I\u2019ve found that question very helpful over the last few years. Are there any questions or exercises that you use for yourself on a regular basis? Catherine Hoke: Yes. So, when I was going through my resignation \u2013 I\u2019ve had a lot of opportunity to study what leads people to bomb out and fail, and I read a book called Leading on Empty by Wayne Cordeiro. As a disclaimer for your audience, it has a Christian spin to it. A lot of us leaders or people who have big goals will lead on empty or drive ourselves to empty, and this book \u2013 similar to Essentialism or a lot of other good business books \u2013 asks the question, \u201cWhat is the 5 percent that only I can do, and why am I spending all this time doing other things that so many other people can do, even if I can do them better in my own arrogance?\u201d So, asking myself what is my 5 percent, what is my secret sauce, and what is my gift to this world that I ask myself nearly every day? I\u2019ve really been honing in on this lately. I just hired a president for Defy Ventures, and his name is Roger Gordon, and I\u2019m so excited to partner with this guy. He will run the day-to-day operations of Defy because that\u2019s not me. It\u2019s not what I like to do. I don\u2019t love managing people. I don\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m the best in the world at it. But, I do know that I\u2019m highly innovative, I can see problems, and can come up with solutions. I know that I\u2019m a strong external representative for Defy, so I\u2019ll be doing more speaking engagements. Although I don\u2019t love raising money, I\u2019m good at it, so I can keep doing that. But, I also know that I have the ability to earn the trust of the people that we work with. For example, lately, I\u2019ve been working at reconciliation efforts within some pretty intense gang cultures, and for some reason, this white girl here is trusted enough by these people to talk about some big transformation efforts. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing on, and I\u2019m working very hard and swiftly to get other things off of my plate. I don\u2019t have responsibility for them \u2013 it\u2019s scary for me to lose control over them, too \u2013 but I have such an amazing staff nationally at Defy now that I\u2019m glad to give away that responsibility so that I can focus on my top 5 percent. If I died in a year, what would I spend my time doing? I ask myself that all the time, and I know that may sound a little bit \u2013what\u2019s the word? Tim Ferriss: Morbid. Catherine Hoke: Morbid, yeah. I don\u2019t care how morbid it sounds. At Defy, we have our EITs write their eulogies, and I\u2019ve done that. In fact, we have them write two eulogies. This is a pretty good exercise that other people could try, too. One of them is your current trajectory eulogy. If you died now, doing your same old same old, and you didn\u2019t make major changes in your life, what would your eulogy say and how would you feel about it? Most people wouldn\u2019t be super satisfied with it. Then, we have them write their ideal but realistic eulogy. If you lived your best life that is also realistic for you, what would that look like? And then, the most important part is to write out the ten changes that you need to make to get from A to B, and then prioritize them and pick the top three things you can start doing today to live a better life. So, I apply all these little Defy exercises to my own life, and I guess I live in a sort of morbid sense, but time is limited for all of us, and I want to have the greatest impact in the shortest amount of time. So, how do I use the gifts that I have been given to \u2013 this is my generous hustle. This is my ability to share something with the world that only I can create. Tim Ferriss: Well, Cat, thank you for developing, sharing, and communicating your gifts with the world. You\u2019re doing really important work. Thank you for taking the time to hang out. Maybe someday, I\u2019ll give you the chance to heel-hook me in person. Maybe we can coordinate that with the prison visit that I did commit to, so you have me on the hook for that. And, 1). I really appreciate you doing what you do, but 2). I also appreciate you taking the time to share it today and have this conversation. Catherine Hoke: Well, Tim, getting to speak with you is one of the greatest honors that I\u2019ve had. I was really excited about this because I know how influential your audience is. Am I allowed to share my email address? Tim Ferriss: We talked a little bit about this. Yes, if you\u2019re willing to get the hug of death with mass numbers of people emailing, you\u2019re welcome to share your email address. Catherine Hoke: All right, here\u2019s what I will say to anyone who\u2019s listening: If you email me, I\u2019m in prison all the time, so please keep it really short, sweet, and to the point. I\u2019m not trying to be rude or anything. But, if you want to get involved with Defy, first of all, you can go to defyventures.org, but if you want to email me, my email address is cat@defyventures.org, and tell me if you would like to come to prison, or if you would like to have us come speak to your organization, or how you would like to get involved. If you want to provide a scholarship to one of our EITs, we would be really grateful if you would become even more of an advocate of second chances and share this message with other people because I always say, \u201cWho would our country be \u2013 who would we all be if we lived up to being the land of second chances that we claim to be?\u201d So, Tim, thank you for the opportunity to share our mission and my story. I see it as a big responsibility and a huge privilege to be a voice on behalf of people who are incarcerated who become voiceless, and often written off, and voteless. And so, it\u2019s my honor to get to share some of our story with all of you. Thank you. Tim Ferriss: My pleasure. Everybody, check out A Second Chance, and for those long-term listeners, you know this part already, but as always, you can find links to everything we talked about \u2013 the books, A Second Chance, the Defy website, and much more \u2013 in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast, where you can find the show notes for all episodes, including this one. Cat, thank you once again for the time, and it was a lovely conversation that has given me a lot of food for thought and things to look forward to, including that visit that we\u2019re going to take together. To everyone listening, as always, thank you for listening, and until next time, keep experimenting, keep testing assumptions, and give yourself a second chance. Take a moment for forgiveness, and that will in turn affect how you are better able to forgive others. Thanks, everybody. Hey, guys. This is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. 1). This is five-bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me \u2013 would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend? Five-bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I\u2019ve found or that I\u2019ve been pondering over the week. That could include favorite new albums that I\u2019ve discovered. It could include gizmos, gadgets, and all sorts of weird shit that I\u2019ve somehow dug up in the world of the esoteric, as I do. It could include favorite articles that I\u2019ve read and shared with my close friends, for instance. It\u2019s very short. It\u2019s just a little, tiny bit of goodness before you head off for the weekend. So, if you want to receive that, check it out, just go to fourhourworkweek.com \u2013 that\u2019s fourhourworkweek.com, all spelled out \u2013 and just drop in your email, and you will get the very next one. If you sign up, I hope you enjoy it.

we\u2019ll get into \u2013 catherine founded defy ventures, a national nonprofit organization that \u201ctransforms the hustle of currently and formerly incarcerated people.\u201d defy has produced groundbreaking results, including a recidivism rate \u2013 that means being readmitted to prison \u2013 of less than 5 percent and an employment rate of 95 percent", "defy\u2019s vision is to end mass incarceration as we know it by using entrepreneurship as a tool to transform legacies and human potential", "cat is amazing on many different levels \u2013 personal, athletic, and otherwise \u2013 and we\u2019re going to dig into the many facets of her life and lessons learned from her father, among many others", "catherine has also been named a \u201cmake tech human agent of change\u201d by wired and one of the \u201c17 global influencers expanding human possibility through technology\u201d by nokia", "cat also received the mdc partners humanitarian award and was included in forbes\u2019 \u201c40 women to watch over 40.\u201d she has been named by fast company one of the most creative people in business and is an ashoka fellow, among many other things", "she is the author of the brand-new book \u2013 and, this is how i was introduced to her via seth godin \u2013 called a second chance, and i recommend that everybody check that out", "and, you can certainly find her and defy on all of the socials, but we are going to get into every aspect of that and much more", "so, without further ado, please enjoy one of my favorite conversations i\u2019ve had in a very long time with catherine \u201ccat\u201d hoke", "cat, welcome to the show", "thanks, tim i have been excited to connect with you because i received a barrage of texts from a mutual friend of ours, mr", "seth godin, and i thought we\u2019d start this with something i\u2019ve been wondering that i actually don\u2019t know the answer to, which is how did you first meet seth", "i sent seth a cold email and he responded", "i invited him to defy ventures, the organization that i run", "i used to have a brick-and-mortar classroom-style teaching model where we would have formerly incarcerated people come to a classroom in new york city, and we\u2019d invite world-class faculty to come, and seth was someone i really wanted to meet", "i couldn\u2019t believe when he said yes, and then he came and taught \u2013 we call them \u201ceits,\u201d or entrepreneurs in training \u2013 he came and met them, and the way that he treated me was like i was such an important person", "i couldn\u2019t believe it", "and then, he became my mentor", "just like that, seth godin is a mentor", "that is a very productive afternoon", "i feel like a spoiled brat, yeah", "i\u2019m really proud to say that he\u2019s not just my mentor, but my friend, and has encouraged me to shoot for the moon", "i\u2019ve done far greater things than i would have expected that i could have done had it not been for seth", "he has believed in me when i have not even believed in myself", "well, he\u2019s an incredible man, and we may circle back to seth, but i want to talk about this cold email because you seem to be good at cold emails and cold letters, and i have to be careful about what i believe on the internet, but i\u2019m going to circle this back to something that took place much further back than your meeting with seth", "but, what did the email say", "what did the pitch look like", "i should look", "so, i cold-emailed him and one of our volunteers simultaneously cold-emailed him, which always helps", "typically, when i cold-email people \u2013 because i\u2019ve gotten amazing people to respond through cold email \u2013 a lot of times, i just say, \u201ci\u2019m going to change the world and i would like to meet with you to pick your smart brain for 15 minutes,\u201d and then, i\u2019m persistent as hell, and i send it back to them six times, and sometimes i leave them voicemails as well, and i befriend their assistant", "so, that\u2019s how i got in to meet with duncan niederauer, who was the ceo of the new york stock exchange, and many people who you would think would not say yes to a cold email, but when i asked for 15 minutes to pick their smart brain \u2013 and, i tell them exactly what i want to learn from them, too", "it\u2019s not like a random \u2013 i tell them, \u201cyou\u2019re an expert in this and i need to learn x.\u201d and, i also tell them, \u201ci can talk really fast and you can kick me out of your office as quickly as you want if you think it\u2019s a waste of time", "so, i always give them an out, but it\u2019s not like i need to do that, and then, i just don\u2019t stop", "i was trained in cutco knife sales \u2013 door-to-door stuff \u2013 and i\u2019ve been a shameless cold-caller", "i used to work for summit partners, a venture capital and private equity firm, where i would cold-call ceos, wanting to get a piece of their pie", "i don\u2019t get hurt by rejection", "i\u2019m able to take it", "but, when i\u2019ve studied sales, most salespeople stop after two or three, and i keep going to six, and it\u2019s amazing how many people end up saying yes", "and then, i always \u2013 a typical sales trick is i\u2019ll throw in another five seconds of information about something that makes them go, \u201cwhat?\u201d i\u2019ll tell them something about myself", "so, i\u2019ll tell them something about their background that we have in common", "tim, i know that you were a wrestler, so i would say, \u201cby the way, i was also a high school wrestler,\u201d something that makes you go, \u201cwhat?\u201d and gets your attention", "all right", "we have so much that we can cover and so many different rabbit holes we can go down", "there are a few things i want to flesh out a little bit", "first, the cutco knives \u2013 i was going to ask you about the cutco knives, and i\u2019m going to try not to lose my train of thought here, but there are so many ways i want to go with this", "thank you for doing such great research", "of course", "correct me if i\u2019m wrong", "you started with selling hamsters at age 7 or thereabouts", "wow, you really went way back", "yes, i did", "i ran a hamster-selling empire", "i would breed them, and i had multiple cages, and then i sold them back to the pet shop for $1.00 apiece", "my sister took after me", "she was breeding rabbits, so we had quite the household", "and then, selling golf balls", "yeah", "i would take off my shoes and socks, walk through the disgusting duck muck, and get the golf balls", "but then, i would also one-up the golfers with donuts and all types of other things to increase my profits", "what is the key to a successful \u2013 and, people listening are like, \u201cwhat the fuck is going on right now?\u201d this is all going somewhere", "the cutco knives \u2013 so, this is door-to-door, we\u2019re talking about", "knock knock, wipe the feet \u2013 so, if cutco were listening, they might cringe if i said \u201cdoor-to-door\u201d because you\u2019re supposed to have a developed network, and with every person you go meet with, you ask them for three references", "\u201cdid you have a good experience with me today", "would you recommend me to your friends", "send me to three other people.\u201d so, it\u2019s not totally door-to-door, but it\u2019s kind of that style", "it\u2019s in-person selling", "yeah", "so, my biggest problem with selling cutco was that i was raised by a hungarian yugoslav immigrant who came over with $200.00 in his pocket and thought that buying us a happy meal was too expensive, so i was selling cutco $1,400.00 knife sets, and i was really good at it, and cutco, they taught me how to nod my head and smile to get that reciprocal behavior, and say, \u201cwill you buy my $1,400.00 knife set?\u201d people were saying yes to me all the time, and i was enjoying the fact that i was so good at it, but i totally felt like i was scamming people, and little did i realize that rich people don\u2019t mind paying $1,400.00 or more for an amazing set of cutlery \u2013 which, by the way, i still own myself and completely believe in \u2013 but because i felt like i might have been scamming people, i had to stop selling cutco knives, and i reduced my own profits because i felt like i was ripping people\u2019s faces off", "so, you get these free products that you can give them", "\u201coh, here, i\u2019ll give you my free cake slicer,\u201d and you\u2019re supposed to use those to help get them to a bigger knife set, but i would get them to say yes to the biggest, most expensive set, and then i would feel guilty for selling them on something so big, so i\u2019d be like, \u201ci\u2019m going to give you these five free products as well.\u201d \u201cand by the way, can you tell me the names of three of your friends you would recommend that i also \u2013?\u201d exactly", "and then, i would get economies of scale on this stuff because when i was on the wrestling team as the only girl, we had to raise money for that, so i would literally go door to door, and after i\u2019d win a match and my wrestling photo was in the sunday paper, i would walk around door to door and be like, \u201chi,\u201d and i\u2019d be in a dress, and i\u2019d be like, \u201ci\u2019m on the davis high school wrestling team, and i\u2019m raising money, and we\u2019re pushing cars around the track, so will you give us money?\u201d and then, i would do that and sell cutco knives at the same time", "so, wait a second", "by \u201cat the same time,\u201d do you mean, \u201chey, thanks for the $50.00 to support the wrestling team", "by the way, i notice that you have a cutting board\u201d", "no", "i would ask for a separate appointment", "i didn\u2019t want to totally overwhelm my customer", "okay", "that would be a hell of a cross-sell", "now, the promise i made earlier to wind this back \u2013 of course, i went all the way back to 7 \u2013 is it true that you were originally turned down by uc berkeley", "is this accurate, that you wrote them a letter", "well, i was admitted to uc berkeley", "i tried to get rejected because my dad wanted me to go to uc berkeley and i wanted to get so far away from home", "i had wrestled and gone to high school in davis, and i looked up the hardest major to get into, which was bioengineering at cal", "it had a 4 percent chance of admission", "well, i got in, and i didn\u2019t really want to be an engineer, and i was flunking out of my engineering courses", "i supported myself through school and i looked up a summer job that was for a management consulting firm \u2013 i had no clue what that was \u2013 and i remember reading the posting aloud to someone and saying, \u201cthis requires an entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d and i didn\u2019t know how to pronounce the word, and i was like, \u201cwhat the hell is that", "what does that mean?\u201d well, i got the job at the management consulting firm, and i discovered what business is, and decided i loved it, so i applied to the undergraduate haas program at uc berkeley, and i got rejected, and i\u2019m not surprised", "i was literally failing out of my engineering courses because my brain is not really that of an engineer", "and so, that\u2019s when i wrote them a seven-page appeal letter, and i was like, \u201clook, i\u2019m a student-athlete", "i work 40 hours a week on top of it", "if you let me in, i promise i\u2019ll make you proud.\u201d and, they let me in", "so, where does this come from, this aggressive drive", "you\u2019re spanning wrestling, which is \u2013 certainly, even now, but at the time \u2013 i think margolis has raised the perception of women\u2019s wrestling in the u.s", "tremendously, but certainly, back then, as a wrestler \u2013 myself throughout high school and the very beginning portions of college \u2013 women would not commonly go into wrestling", "you had this entrepreneurial drive really early on", "where does that come from", "i feel like i was raised in a mini shark tank at my house", "my dad is an inventor to this day", "he\u2019s 73 years old, and he patents all types of stuff", "he\u2019s an electrical engineer", "he taught me to see the world through quite a different lens", "when i was as young as age 6 or 7, he would have me stand up in family \u2013 and i never knew when he was going to do it \u2013 and say, \u201cyou have one minute to invent something, talk about the market and how you\u2019re going to price it, the demand, and your strategy for getting it out there.\u201d and, i would come up with ridiculous things", "i can\u2019t even remember", "i remember that one of my favorite inventions was shoes that could fly, and what i remember about doing that with my father is that he never told me that one of my ideas was stupid or not feasible", "he could have just raised a very delusional child who thought that she could do anything, and i guess he kind of did, but i \u2013 whenever i saw problems and things that i didn\u2019t like about the world and would complain about them, my dad would say to me, \u201cinstead of complaining about it, why don\u2019t you figure out how you can fix it?\u201d for example, i was raised in a super weird immigrant home", "i was not allowed to watch television, almost never", "we were never allowed to watch sports", "he said, \u201cwhy would you watch somebody else going out there and getting it when you could invest that same time in doing it yourself?\u201d so, he told me to get my butt out there, work out, and learn how to become the best at something", "he said, \u201cif you\u2019re going to become a chimney sweeper, just become the best chimney sweeper.\u201d so, i didn\u2019t really know that there was another way, and i really believed i could do anything, so i thought \u2013 i was born in canada and french was my first language", "we came over to the u.s", "when i was 7", "when my dad got invited to come and teach at stanford and told me that we were moving to the u.s., i said, \u201cno, i don\u2019t want to because i can\u2019t become the president of the united states,\u201d and i have zero political aspirations today, by the way", "but, when i told him i couldn\u2019t become the president, he said, \u201ci\u2019m going to give you a little time to think about that, about how you could come up with a solution for that problem.\u201d so, i came back to him a week or so later, and i said, \u201ci\u2019ve got it", "we can move to the united states", "i will become a lawyer", "i will change the constitution of the united states so that someone who\u2019s not born in the united states can become the president, and then i will become the president.\u201d and then, after we moved to the u.s., he introduced me to everybody as the future president of the united states", "when he said it, i thought he was being serious", "he believed in me, so i believed in myself, and i guess that\u2019s why i run something called defy now", "i actually believe i can do it", "like jerry colonna says, i am pathologically optimistic about my goals", "all right", "that is a very thorough and extremely helpful answer", "what was your dad invited to teach at stanford", "electrical engineering", "electrical engineering", "and, the reason you moved to the u.s", "was because of the faculty invitation from stanford", "yup", "he got a one-year invitation, and then, it turned into two years, and he could have stayed at stanford, but my dad is a ski freak, and he just wanted to be closer to the mountains, so that\u2019s why we moved to davis, and he taught at uc davis", "i\u2019m a lot like my dad in that he loves to invent stuff, so he left university life and is still \u2013 he works until 5:00 in the morning just inventing new stuff", "sounds like a cool gig", "would he call himself an inventor \u2013", "yes", "\u2013 a product developer, or neither", "he would say \u201cinventor\u201d", "yeah", "what was your home like outside of your father", "was your mom around", "do you have siblings", "paint a picture for people", "i\u2019m the oldest of four kids", "i was like a mini mom", "my mother would literally want to bring homeless people back to our house", "my mom\u2019s really compassionate and caring, and she used to be a nurse, but stayed at home to take care of the kids", "i developed a lot of my compassion and heart for serving others from my mom, and i remember my mom telling me, \u201ceat all the food on your plate because there are starving kids in africa.\u201d i was like, \u201cokay, if i don\u2019t eat all the food on my plate, how are the starving kids in africa going to get my food?\u201d so, i think was 7 \u2013 this is from my dad, \u201cfind a solution to the problem.\u201d so, i found some sponsorship program to sponsor a kid in africa", "the golf ball money and hamster-selling money \u2013 i thought i was balling when i was 7 years old \u2013 i would send that money overseas to sponsor orphans", "so, i developed a heart for other people and not just for making a buck", "i\u2019m very competitive, if you can\u2019t tell, and i love money because i love what money can do to create the world that i want to live in", "you are competitive", "i\u2019m going to add some more color to that", "please fact check and tell me if any of this is incorrect", "california state women\u2019s wrestling champ, three-time marathon runner, college rugby player, varsity rower, and you still enjoy \u2013 we talked about this a little bit \u2013 the brazilian jiu-jitsu, which has deprived me of the structural integrity of my ankle as of last week with some snapped ligaments", "but, you are certainly very competitive, and i also want to note something that we discussed very briefly", "during the sound check, before i hit \u201crecord,\u201d i asked you what your breakfast was, and you said, \u201ccoffee.\u201d i said, \u201cokay, i need a few more seconds, so just talk about your coffee for sound check.\u201d you said, \u201cmedium warm coffee", "i put in ice cubes.\u201d and then, you kept on going", "i thought you were making it \u2013 you told me to talk for 15 seconds", "no, i know", "i thought maybe you were making this up", "i was like, \u201cwait, what\u2019s the story on the medium warm coffee", "can you tell people what the story is?\u201d well, i like to be very efficient and fast, and i like to eat fast and drink fast, so i put ice cubes in my coffee so i can pound it", "i actually think things tend to taste better when i eat or drink them really fast", "i don\u2019t understand people who like to chew on their food for two hours", "it annoys me", "i mean, it\u2019s fine for them, but not for me", "so, you and i have a number of overlapping circles", "i am also of the fast \u2013 yeah, we\u2019re going to roll after this scenario, right", "oh, god", "i\u2019m going to meet you in austin and we\u2019re going to roll", "you know what", "i\u2019ll just let you triangle-choke me because given your credentials, i don\u2019t think i\u2019m going to give you much of a fight", "i can talk a big game, but i\u2019ll be gentle", "so, we talked about seth", "there seem to be a number of other people \u2013 we don\u2019t have to spend too much time on this, but i know, for instance, that i\u2019ve spent some time with jerry colonna, who you mentioned", "he\u2019s one of our faculty members, too", "yeah, jerry is amazing", "there\u2019s another \u2013 also, of course, these two know each other \u2013 brad feld, who is an incredible guy and an incredible investor as well", "where did the entrepreneurs in training enter the picture", "how did that become part of your life", "when i was 26, i was working for a new york city private equity firm, and i got invited to present for the first time in my life, and that changed everything in my life because i used to think that people who were incarcerated were the scum of the earth", "when i was 12, a good friend of mine was brutally murdered by two 16-year-old boys, and from that experience of one, i extrapolated to think that anyone in prison could rot and die in that place", "it was that first prison visit \u2013 i\u2019m 40 years old now; we\u2019re three months apart, tim \u2013 when i was 26, that visit opened my eyes and my heart, and it ended up \u2013 i didn\u2019t know it would end up becoming my life\u2019s calling, but it ended up changing my wallet, my priorities, and my time", "it\u2019s what i\u2019ve devoted everything to now \u2013 the second chance field and working with people with criminal histories", "the world calls them all types of things, like \u201cex-offender\u201d or \u201ccriminal,\u201d and i say, \u201cwe don\u2019t work with criminals", "we work with people who committed criminal acts in their past, and there\u2019s a really big difference.\u201d so, at defy, i believe we\u2019re all ex-somethings, and we call them eits, or entrepreneurs in training", "and then, they become full-fledged entrepreneurs", "so, i have a few notes just because i\u2019ve had sufficient caffeine to want to talk a lot", "the first is a really important distinction that you made", "as some backstory, before i hit \u201crecord,\u201d you asked me, \u201cdo i have the right to call you out if you call them criminals?\u201d and i said, \u201cyes, you do.\u201d the language we use is so important in this context and many others", "for instance, i have tried very hard for myself to not call myself an anxious \u2013 \u201ci am anxious\u201d \u2013 to use that language or to say, \u201ci am an anxious person.\u201d rather, i say, \u201ci feel anxiety\u201d to depersonalize it in that way", "so, \u201cpeople with a criminal past\u201d is different than \u201cex-criminal\u201d or \u201ccriminal.\u201d they\u2019re very distinct labels that create an entirely distinct way of relating to somebody with one versus the other", "i just want to underscore how important that is, not just for how you label other people, but how you label yourself", "absolutely", "we\u2019re big on that; really big on how we label ourselves", "yeah, it\u2019s really important", "the question, then, that i have is why did this stick", "why did this become what appears to be a lifelong passion and commitment, whereas you had tried so many things in the past and you\u2019re no longer selling hamsters or doing private equity", "why did this stick", "was there a specific conversation", "was there a specific moment", "what was it that made this stick for you", "i didn\u2019t think it would stick, and when i went to prison that very first time in texas, what i saw there shocked my heart", "i have made so many bad decisions and mistakes in my own life, and i\u2019m really grateful for the grace and second chances that i\u2019ve received, yet i was so quick to write off and label people who had been caught for something criminal", "so, i was convicted by the ugliness of my own heart because when i went and visited the prison, i realized \u2013 this might sound stupid \u2013 that they were actually human beings, not a rap sheet, not a number", "and, the first guy the i met in prison that weekend \u2013 his name was johnny \u2013 and i heard his story", "when johnny was 8 years old, he watched as his grandfather murdered his father right in front of him, and then, when johnny was 11 or 12, he was given drugs, jumped into a gang, and by the age of 18, he was incarcerated", "empathy for the people that i serve is what made it stick because i was like, \u201cwow, had i been raised in those circumstances, i am certain that i would have ended up on that path as well.\u201d and, to this day, when i hear the stories of the people that i serve \u2013 i was just in a prison last week, and i do this exercise called \u201cstep to the line.\u201d we have all our ceos, venture capitalists, and executive volunteers on one side of the line, and then we have our eits \u2013 or entrepreneurs-in-training, the incarcerated \u2013 on the other side of the line", "you step to the line if each statement is true", "\u201cstep to the line if you\u2019ve ever been arrested.\u201d about a third of our volunteers are at the line", "\u201cstep to the line if you\u2019ve ever done something for which you could have been arrested, but you have not been arrested.\u201d 100 percent of our volunteers step to the line", "\u201cstep to the line if you were arrested for the first time before the age of 16.\u201d maybe 75 percent of our eits step to the line", "and then, i count backwards", "\u201cstep to the line if you were incarcerated before the age of 14, 12, 10.\u201d and, i get to age 8, \u201cif you were first incarcerated at the age of 8.\u201d there are four guys remaining at the line", "\u201c7.\u201d there\u2019s one guy remaining at the line", "and, i\u2019m trying to picture a 7-year-old or an 8-year-old in handcuffs, and normally, a prison cell seems pretty small and stifling, but imagine a little 7- or 8-year-old there", "my empathy for the people that i serve is what made this stick for me, and i don\u2019t have pity for them, i have a deep compassion", "i also have mad respect for their skills", "i work with natural born entrepreneurs who started off selling gumballs out of their lockers \u2013 not hamsters \u2013 and gumballs proceeded into drugs, which kept going, and then they got arrested", "but, i have a love of underdogs, and a love of entrepreneurs, and i hate injustice", "when i was a little kid growing up and saw somebody else getting bullied, i would always stand up for them and defend the victim", "here i was in the midst of people who have been thrown away by society, who are not just aspiring entrepreneurs, but who are proven entrepreneurs with amazing talents", "i believe that the people i serve represent america\u2019s most overlooked talent pool", "that first weekend in texas, when i was 26 years old and na\u00efve as could be, i went to four prisons, and at the last one, the guys were like, \u201cwill you please come back?\u201d i said yes", "my dad also taught me to be a person of my word", "i had no idea what it meant to come back, i had never talked to a warden before, but after i said yes, i was coming back, and i did", "most likely, i\u2019m going to get this pronunciation wrong, but can you tell us \u2013 i\u2019m all about second chances, tim", "i\u2019ve never used that one before, either", "i can tell you\u2019ve been working on your material", "all right", "\u201ccoss marte\u201d", "is this correct", "pretty good", "yeah, \u201ccoss marte.\u201d can you tell us who coss marte is", "yeah", "he\u2019s one of our best-known success stories", "he\u2019s a graduate of defy ventures", "he did five years in prison in the new york state prison system, and he went to prison at age 19, so he grew up in poverty, heroin needles all around him, and he said that the one thing he wanted to become when he was older was rich", "he didn\u2019t know how to get out of the system, but he saw his mother working overtime to put food on the table", "so, when he was a young teenager, he got introduced to the world of selling drugs, and he got incarcerated for the first time at 12 or 13, i think, and bounced in and out", "by the time he was 19 and got arrested on a kingpin case, he was running a drug empire in new york where he was doing $2 million a year in drug sales", "he had an army of people working for him, and he was a young, natural entrepreneur, and when he was incarcerated, he realized that in fact, he was very entrepreneurial, but his entrepreneurial skillsets were being used to destroy communities rather than build them up", "he had a wake-up call in prison when he was sent to the shu \u2013 to solitary confinement \u2013 after having an altercation with an officer", "he was also so overweight and unhealthy when he got sent to prison that doctors told him that he would die in prison, even though he was only doing five years", "he was like, \u201ci\u2019m not dying in prison.\u201d so, while he was locked up in solitary confinement in a box that was the size of a parking spot, he came up with a body-weight-bearing workout and lost 70 pounds", "when he got out of the shu, he taught other incarcerated men at that prison \u2013 about 20 of them had to lose a collective 1,000 pounds, so he was onto something with his prison-style fitness workout, and he got out of prison, and he had always wanted to become a legal entrepreneur", "so, with defy\u2019s help, he turned that into conbody, and conbody is a prison-style fitness boot camp", "in less than three years, it has had more than 14,000 customers", "he said that he follows around women wearing yoga pants, asks them where they work out, and gives them his business card", "he\u2019s hired nearly 20 people with criminal histories \u2013 other defy ventures graduates who have not started their own business \u2013 and we\u2019ve helped coss to raise more than $250,000.00 in funding for his business because we run these shark tank-style pitch competitions, and he killed it in all of our competitions, and then we introduced him to other angel investors", "what i love about coss is that he\u2019s not just about his financial bottom line, but whenever i ask him to give back and serve, he always does", "so, we work with defy in the most notorious prison in america, called pelican bay, where they have a solitary confinement facility, and we run a program in solitary confinement", "coss came to pelican bay with me and led a workout for the incarcerated guys who are currently in the shu", "i can\u2019t tell you how awesome it was to have him", "he was able to tell his story of going from the shu to being a ceo, and his business continues to thrive and boom, and saks fifth avenue in new york city needed more foot traffic, so they literally opened up a conbody gym inside saks, and now, men and women \u2013 mostly women \u2013 are flocking through saks to get to conbody, where they go to these workouts", "if you go to a conbody workout, you\u2019ll be paired up with your \u201ccellie,\u201d and you\u2019ll have formerly incarcerated trainers that coss has hired yelling at you to bring out the best in you and your physical fitness", "he also has conbodylive.com, and he now has customers from 24 different countries that sign up for $5.00 a month, and it\u2019s amazing to watch his hustling skills combined with his heart, and the way that he uses his voice for prison reform and advocacy", "i couldn\u2019t be prouder for us to be early incubators of conbody and for us to be behind coss marte", "and, as i understand it, more than 150 businesses \u2013 the number may be outdated now \u2013 it\u2019s now nearly 200 business that we have incubated and funded through our post-release incubator", "so, i\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate a little bit because i\u2019m sure there are people listening who have different emotional responses to the subject of the incarcerated or \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the currently incarcerated", "how do you decide or vet those people who should be given second chances versus those who should remain incarcerated because they are genuine threats to society and unfit to be reintegrated", "the reason i ask that is that i know people who are incarcerated who have been repeat offenders, violent offenders, who are \u2013 i hate to say it, but at this point, they should not be released in the short term, based on my firsthand experience watching what some of these people have done", "how do you vet, filter, and train in such a way that you ensure \u2013 because your numbers are very impressive", "i will have already read this in the introduction that i record separately, but let\u2019s reread the bio because i think we\u2019re going to dig into a bunch of different facets of it", "so, if you can bear with me boring you by reading your own bio, here we go", "after being given a second chance of her own \u2013 which we\u2019re going to come back to \u2013 catherine founded defy ventures, a national nonprofit organization that transforms the \u201chustle\u201d of currently and formerly incarcerated people", "defy has produced groundbreaking results, including \u2013 this is the key here \u2013 a recidivism rate of less than 5 percent and an employment rate of 95 percent", "defy\u2019s vision is to end mass incarceration by using entrepreneurship as a tool to transform legacies and human potential", "and then, you have many different accolades \u2013 \u201c100 most creative people in business\u201d according to fast company, ashoka fellow in 2013 \u2013 but i won\u2019t get into all of those", "how do you filter and cultivate the right people versus the wrong people", "all right", "so, although i speak with great passion about defy\u2019s eits, i never take away from the fact that they have made grave mistakes, that they have hurt society, that they have hurt individuals, and that nothing about that is okay", "so, i\u2019m not one of these people that say, \u201coh, no one should go to prison", "let the prison doors fly open so everyone can just get out.\u201d when people hurt people and are a threat to society, they are sent to prison, and that\u2019s not a bad thing", "in fact, i believe that an adult time out is often a very important element of people\u2019s transformation", "so, i know that it\u2019s really important for people to have a consequence, and sometimes, that consequence really needs to be prison", "sometimes, people need to be taken out of society", "i think we\u2019re way too liberal with the way that we hand out time, and i can get into my opinions of how we sentence people and the racial and economic disparities", "i can get into that all day long because there is major injustice in that, but let\u2019s just go with this", "when hurt people hurt other people, there needs to be a consequence, and i believe prison is often a solid consequence for that", "it\u2019s called the \u201cfield of corrections,\u201d and unfortunately, when people are sent to prison, they\u2019re usually thrown away, and it\u2019s pure punishment", "what many people in society don\u2019t realize is that 95 percent of incarcerated people are coming back out to become our neighbors", "so, yes, the people i\u2019ve served have done some terrible things \u2013 sometimes, things that make my own stomach turn even though i\u2019m around these people and the crimes that they\u2019ve \u2013 i know their rap sheets intimately", "so, what kind of neighbor do you want coming back to live next to you", "do you want someone who has not been rehabilitated or do you want someone who has been rehabilitated", "at defy, we actually work with people who have committed tougher crimes than most", "we work at a lot of maximum security facilities \u2013 and, when i say we work in solitary confinement, you don\u2019t go to solitary confinement unless you\u2019ve made some really bad decisions", "90 percent of the people that we serve have committed violent crimes", "people who commit murder \u2013 nearly all of them still get out of prison", "i think people don\u2019t realize that", "and so, if we lock them up like they\u2019re an animal and give them no resources, and when they get out, offer them no opportunities to make it legally, what are they going to go back to", "as a society, we decide", "the other thing is i\u2019m not the one who decides if they serve time or how much time they do", "our american judges, juries, and prosecutors determine that", "according to the way our laws are set up, when you get sentenced to a term, you supposedly pay your debt to society, and unfortunately, when people get out prison, they\u2019re often treated like they\u2019re wearing invisible handcuffs for the rest of their lives", "and, especially if you\u2019ve been a victim of a crime, you might be like, \u201cgood", "i want them to permanently suffer.\u201d well, i\u2019ve been a victim of multiple crimes\u2013 some of the worst crimes \u2013 myself, and vengeance can be a really ugly thing", "when i get into a healthy place in my own head, i realize that if i had my vengeance on every human who has hurt me and just tortured them, it might bring out worse things in them, but if they could get healing for the ways that they have hurt me and live the fullest life that they could \u2013 up to their fullest potential \u2013 who would we be as a country if they had healing and forgiveness and didn\u2019t make other victims", "that\u2019s what i want for myself and for the people i serve", "we\u2019re all offenders", "we all hurt people", "i think that when it comes to people who are in prison, there\u2019s this real \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality", "\u201cthey\u2019re in prison; they should rot in there.\u201d but, when our volunteers come to prison with us, i ask them some pretty challenging questions through that \u201cstep to the line\u201d exercise", "\u201cstep to the line if you have ever been in a fight to prove yourself", "go all the way back to your childhood", "even if you pulled the hair of a sibling, punched a boy who was picking on you in the park \u2013 something like that \u2013 as a little kid, as a 7- or 8-year-old, step to the line.\u201d i would say that 70 or 80 percent of our volunteers are at the line on that", "and then, i say, \u201cstep to the line if you\u2019ve ever committed a violent crime.\u201d none of our volunteers are at the line, but close to 100 percent of our eits are at the line", "i tell the volunteers, \u201ci must not be making myself clear", "i did not say to step to the line if you\u2019ve been convicted of a violent crime", "step to the line if you\u2019ve committed a violent crime", "earlier, 70 or 80 percent of you were at the line when i asked if you\u2019ve ever been in a childhood fight", "almost all of you were there.\u201d well, the volunteers roll their eyes at me because they\u2019re like, \u201ccome on", "the little fight that i got in at the playground", "that\u2019s not a violent crime.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cactually, if you look at the backstories of the people that i serve, about half of them were arrested for the first time before they were 10 or 11, and when i ask them what it was for, they say, \u2018my mom was strung out and i broke into my neighbor\u2019s house to steal food because i was hungry,\u2019 or \u2018i was 10 and a 13-year-old was picking on me at the park, so i punched him in the face.\u2019\u201d it\u2019s stuff like that", "it\u2019s very easy for us to turn the other person into a villain, into a wild, caged animal, to dehumanize the offender, but i can see myself in that offender, and i think that if we all look deep enough, many of us can see ourselves, and if you can\u2019t see yourself in that, i bet you could see your brother, your sister, or your best friend", "if we were all permanently for the worst thing that we\u2019ve ever done, we might think a little bit differently about the labels that we attach to people", "unfortunately, once people go to prison or jail for the first time, when they\u2019re on their way out, a lot of officers will tell them, \u201csee you back here.\u201d in our country, 76.6 percent of people are rearrested", "nearly everybody", "if you go in once, it\u2019s a revolving door, and that is such a sad statistic", "another statistic that kills me is that 70 percent of the children of incarcerated people follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps", "quite a legacy to inherit", "the good news is that we can break this legacy, and we can break that revolving door, and we\u2019re called defy, and yeah, we have a return-to-prison rate of less than 5 percent, so this is a totally solvable problem", "but, if we as americans and society continue to write people off as being less than human and saying, \u201cit\u2019s gross that you even give them a chance,\u201d you\u2019re going to get a different kind of neighbor back, the kind of neighbor that is going to scare you, the kind of neighbor that none of us want", "thank you", "you mentioned something earlier that i think is worth underscoring, which is the question \u2013 i\u2019d be curious to know how people respond if you actually pose this to them, whether to volunteers or otherwise", "\u201cwhat if you were only known for the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d do you actually pose that, or is it a rhetorical question", "i do a lot of speaking engagements, and i open with that nearly every single time", "i tell people, \u201cthink back to the action that you regret most in your life", "think about the labels that would be attached to that", "\u2018drunk,\u2019 \u2018cheater,\u2019 \u2018adulterer\u2019 \u2013 i don\u2019t know what it is", "and now, imagine for the rest of your life \u2013 it\u2019s 20 years later and you\u2019ve paid the consequences in full for whatever mistake you\u2019ve made, but now, you are permanently known as \u2018ex-drunk,\u2019 \u2018ex-cheater,\u2019 \u2018ex-embezzler,\u2019 \u2018ex-liar,\u2019 \u2018ex-shitty dad,\u2019 \u2018ex-whatever,\u2019 and you go fill out a job application, and at the top of your job application, it\u2019s the first thing you have to check the box on even though it\u2019s 20 years later", "\u201cnext time that you want to rent an apartment or get a mortgage, it\u2019s the first thing you have to write \u2013 your ex-label", "the people that i serve have paid their debt to society, but for the rest of their lives, they are known as an ex-drug dealer or an ex-fill-in-the-blank", "what would your life be like if you were handcuffed by your most shameful moment?\u201d well, i suppose this is as good a place as any to segue into forgiveness, but the way we\u2019re going to get there \u2013 i remember when i was chatting with seth, i wanted to know how openly we could talk about different parts of your biography", "your bio on the website begins with \u201cafter being given a second chance of her own \u2013\u201d can you explain what that refers to", "sure", "it should probably say, \u201cafter being given so many second, third, and fourth chances,\u201d but i will share the mistake \u2013 the bad decisions \u2013 that i am most known for, since i ask other people what it would be like for them if they were known for that worst thing", "so, the short version of it is that after devoting my life to working with people with criminal histories \u2013 i moved to texas, i started what became known as prison entrepreneurship program, pep, and is still going there today, and i poured my everything into it", "i had $50,000.00 in my bank account", "it wasn\u2019t enough", "i cashed out my 401(k) because working with these people and making sure that they had a bright future was more important than my own financial stability", "i went all in on this, and for five years, i built up pep to be a very successful prison rehabilitation program that was equipping men in the texas prison system to become successful legal entrepreneurs, but more than that, employees, fathers, and voices in their communities", "and then, i tanked", "i made decisions that i thought ruined my everything and my entire future", "so, the first time i was married, it was for nine years", "i got married when i was 22", "at the age of 31, i was served divorce papers, and i was living in texas in a very christian community where god hates divorce, and divorce is sin, and i was so ashamed", "i said the one thing i would never be was a divorced woman, and here i was, a divorced woman", "following my divorce, i also went through a lot of hard times", "i was sick with pneumonia, i was hospitalized, i had to move out of my house, and instead of reaching out to friends or a community that would have been supportive of me, in my own shame over my divorce, i put my head in the sand, and i felt so alone", "when i was in the hospital and didn\u2019t know who to call to come pick me up, that was one of the loneliest, worst moments that i can remember", "well, the people that i felt comfortable confiding in over my personal failure were released graduates from the texas prison system", "the people who picked me up from the hospital were graduates", "the people who packed up my boxes and moved me out of my house \u2013 i had been taking care of people for a long time, and now, i was at the bottom and needed to be taken care of", "in a moment of weakness, i crossed boundaries and had some relationships with people who had been released from the texas prison system", "what i did was not illegal, but i knew better", "i absolutely shouldn\u2019t have done it", "i regretted it right afterward", "i\u2019ve always taught my graduates a model of full disclosure", "own your mistakes and share them", "don\u2019t get caught", "so, i followed my own advice, and i was honest about my poor decisions, and it cost me my everything at the time", "it cost me everything", "when the texas prison system learned about my decisions, they forced my resignation and forced \u2013 this was eight years ago now \u2013 they forced it in the media, too", "up until that moment, i had been known \u2013 people called me the \u201cprison angel\u201d who \u201cministered to the dark side.\u201d that was absolutely not true, but \u2013 people had a mother teresa image of me because i was not known for big mistakes yet, and then, my news came crashing in the media, and i became known for a sex scandal instead of the good work that i had poured my life into", "i was already suffering from so much shame, so now, to be known for this and to get the ejector seat from my own organization, to lose my identity as a passionate young founder and ceo, to lose my identity as a wife, i felt like i had ruined god\u2019s calling for my life", "i saw no reason to live anymore", "i didn\u2019t want to live anymore", "what saved my life was that shortly before my scandal went out across national media, i sent out a full disclosure letter, and at the time, we had 7,500 supporters \u2013 top ceos, investors, and people i respected more than anyone in the world \u2013 and i said, \u201ci screwed up", "i made these bad decisions", "i\u2019m a divorced woman", "i don\u2019t know what\u2019s next in my life.\u201d sending that letter was super painful for me, but within about 24 hours of sending it, my inbox filled up with nearly 1,000 emails of love, and support, and \u201cyou\u2019ve always preached grace and second chances,\u201d and \u201cwhat are you doing next with your life?\u201d if you can\u2019t tell, i\u2019m an all-in person, and i had no plan b, but it was people \u2013 other human beings saw potential in me when i saw no potential in myself", "i used to think, \u201cwhat happens to leaders like me who screw up", "is there some island for castaways", "do we all go serve starbucks somewhere", "what do we do?\u201d i had no vision for a better future", "all i could see was dark clouds and no reason to live anymore", "the fact that people saw potential and a future in me \u2013 and more than that, the fact that people \u2013 i took a year off after my resignation", "i went through massive therapy \u2013 i\u2019d already been through massive therapy \u2013 and i went to leadership blowup camps where other ceos and pastors go", "i guess i wasn\u2019t the only person to screw up their life", "when i went there, other people had the opportunity to care for me", "i have these people i call my adopted parents, and they said, \u201cjust come stay with us for a while.\u201d i hardly knew these people at the time, and they said, \u201cwe will love you back to life.\u201d i had nothing to offer people", "i learned for the first time \u2013 i\u2019m sorry to interrupt", "how did you meet these adoptive parents", "so, their names are bill and andrea townsend", "bill is a serial entrepreneur who lives in salt lake city, utah, and he had sent pep \u2013 my texas organization \u2013 a big fat check, and i couldn\u2019t tell it was from him", "i had to do a lot of due diligence to track down who it was from, which was weird, because usually, i know where the money is coming from", "when i finally found out it was from him, i requested to meet with him, and as it turned out, i had a super short meeting with him in an airport for 30 minutes", "when i met with him, he was like, \u201cthank you for the work you do.\u201d i was like, \u201cthank you for the big, fat check that you wrote me.\u201d he was like, \u201cno, thank you for the work that you do.\u201d his whole demeanor was really different", "he was thankful that i was serving the world and not everybody\u2019s like that about it", "and then, what really struck me about that meeting with bill \u2013 so, bill loves god and grace, and he said, \u201cdo you serve people with sexual criminal histories?\u201d i said, \u201cno, the texas prison system won\u2019t allow us to serve that.\u201d i believe all things can be redeemed, and look \u2013 i\u2019m going to say this right now, tim \u2013 nobody likes sexual crime, especially not me, having been a victim of that myself", "nobody likes that", "but, if people with even ugly crimes don\u2019t have an opportunity to rehabilitate \u2013 those are the crimes that we don\u2019t want repeated in society, right", "anyway, bill said to me, \u201cdo you serve people who have committed those crimes?\u201d i said, \u201cno, because the texas prison system won\u2019t let me.\u201d he said, \u201cwell, what if we started a different organization \u2013 a separate umbrella \u2013 that served those people?\u201d i said, \u201cwell, maybe that would be a nice thing to think about in the future.\u201d with a lot of my texas donors, when they find out that i don\u2019t serve people with a certain crime category, they\u2019re relieved, they\u2019re so glad, and they sometimes tell me that they wouldn\u2019t fund me if i served those people, which always surprises me, because i\u2019m like, \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t you want those people rehabilitated?\u201d anyway, i\u2019m deviating right now", "bill had a really different heart, and he had no reason to care about those people, but i think he cares about people who have been written off and stigmatized, and he and andrea have this ability to see potential in anybody", "it\u2019s like they see the world through these rose-colored glasses, and they\u2019re not na\u00efve human beings by any means", "so, they were the first ones who called me after i sent out my resignation letter to 7,500 people, and i was drowning in shame, and self-hate, and disgust, and my phone rang", "bill had called me a half an hour later, and he said, \u201csweetie, we love you", "come stay with us.\u201d i was like, \u201cwho are you", "i\u2019m a scandalous, divorced woman with nothing to offer", "i hardly know you", "i\u2019ve never met your wife.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201ccome stay with us and we\u2019ll love you back to life.\u201d well, i had nothing to lose", "i was at the bottom of myself, and i was willing to do anything, and i thought i was so gross that i said yes", "there was a small group of amazing people who poured into me in that year and made me think that i still had potential", "i tell my story all the time, so i don\u2019t know why i\u2019m so emotional right now, but it\u2019s because people saw something in me when i thought i had nothing left that i am such a believer in second chances \u2013 or, what i actually believe in now is legitimate first chances", "much of the world thinks that the people that i serve are so rotten or that they have no value, and i know better, and i know that hope is a cure for violence, and i know that they\u2019ve done such horrible, hurtful things", "i know that for the most part, horrible, hurtful things have been done to them, and i know that unless there\u2019s some intervention \u2013 and, many people don\u2019t want to get their hands dirty and do this kind of work \u2013 unless there\u2019s some kind of intervention, this will be a generational legacy of incarceration, violence, crime, and drug abuse", "it\u2019s a big, fat waste of taxpayer dollars, and it hurts more people", "the solution that i\u2019ve come up with is not just business, but it\u2019s also about love, healing, and redemption", "it works all day long, and it works with \u2013 when i start in a new prison system, i tell the commissioner of the prison system and the wardens, \u201csend me to your hellhole", "send me to the worst of the worst \u2013 the guys who refuse to program.\u201d what i see time and time again is that no one is beyond redemption", "some people don\u2019t want to change, and those guys \u2013 i have nothing to talk to them about", "if they want to be criminals, i tell them, \u201cget out,\u201d because i don\u2019t cut for criminals", "nobody likes criminals", "i hate criminals", "i don\u2019t work with criminals", "i work with people who take ownership of their past and who want a better future", "thank you for that", "you\u2019re welcome i\u2019m just chewing on all that", "take your time", "well, there are many questions, and i will ask them all, but i will start with one that\u2019s not related directly to the population you work with", "it\u2019s much broader than that", "when you talk to someone who is very unforgiving of themselves \u2013 and, let\u2019s just say there is some catalyzing event that they are ashamed of or that they find unbearable in themselves \u2013 the reason that this comes to mind is a)", "historically, i\u2019ve been an absolute f-minus student at forgiving myself for anything, and i find that that is very often paired with hyper competitiveness in the sense that if you look at people who are successful athletes and highly competitive throughout school, high school, college or whatever it might be, it seems to very often be part and parcel of a package that includes a low level of forgiveness", "you have very high standards for yourself, and in excess, that can be very damaging", "so, when you interact with someone who has a very difficult time forgiving themselves, what are the recommendations that you make", "what are the things that you say", "what are the books that you recommend", "it could go in any number of directions, but i\u2019ll leave it open-ended because that\u2019s all that comes to mind at the moment", "what do you say to those people", "\u201cyou are not your past.\u201d as hard as it might be to believe, especially if you\u2019re currently suffering the consequences of your past decision, you are not your past", "you are not one decision or five decisions that you\u2019ve made in your life", "i don\u2019t just believe, i know that every one of us is capable of having a better future than we\u2019ve had in our past, but there are some steps that we need to take to live a better future", "so, first of all, recognize that you are not your past, and that you are not that label, because if you keep calling yourself that, you\u2019re probably going to keep acting that way", "that belief/expectation cycle \u2013 when we have a belief about ourselves, and we expect that that\u2019s going to be true about ourselves, and then we end up acting that way, and we have more experiences that just confirm that belief about ourselves", "so, in prison, when our volunteers \u2013 including our ceos \u2013 come in, i say, \u201cshare with your partner what your voice of shame is in your head \u2013 that tape of shame that keeps playing in your head", "what does it say", "say it out loud.\u201d and, people regularly say the same thing, whether they\u2019re incarcerated or whether they\u2019re the ceo of a billion-dollar company", "that voice is often, \u201cyou are not good enough", "you are a failure", "you are a sucky dad", "you\u2019re a loser", "you\u2019ll be just like your father.\u201d these are the same messages of shame", "so, i don\u2019t know what your message of shame is, but start by identifying that", "and then, i say, \u201ccan you believe that you talk to yourself this way", "it\u2019s so ugly", "would you allow anyone else to walk up to you and be like, \u2018you\u2019re a loser", "you will never amount to anything\u2019?\u201d i don\u2019t know anyone who has any ounce of dignity \u2013 or even who doesn\u2019t \u2013 who would allow another human being to walk up, get in their face, and say that, but many of us are not only tolerant of that voice of shame that we feed ourselves all day long, it\u2019s almost like we encourage it", "we say, \u201cyeah, you are a loser,\u201d and we keep pounding that into our own brains", "at defy, we do something called affirmations, and it\u2019s cheesy, and i tell our eits, \u201cfake it \u2018til you make it", "pick your head up, and i want you belting this out at the top of your lungs like you\u2019re a proud army.\u201d and, they say things like, \u201ci am worthy of the love i am receiving", "i am an entrepreneur", "i forgive myself", "i am forgiven.\u201d we have a whole list of affirmations", "we also go through this exercise where they identify what is called self-limiting believes, like lies that we tell ourselves", "the problem with this exercise is that sometimes, it\u2019s really hard to identify the log that is in our own eye, so sometimes, our friends can hear it come out", "if i\u2019m like, \u201coh, i\u2019m going to fail in this podcast with tim\u201d \u2013 if i say that out loud, maybe a friend of mine can pick up on that and say, \u201cthat\u2019s one of your self-limiting beliefs.\u201d and then, we have them write out their self-freeing beliefs, and then we tell them to meditate on it every day \u2013 every morning \u2013 for a minimum of 30 days, and then read it aloud to somebody else", "but, a lot of reversing the message of shame is what we say is a choice to forgive", "what we teach at defy is that forgiveness is not a feeling", "you\u2019re not going to feel like forgiving yourself", "forgiveness is not something that we earn", "there\u2019s no amount of good deeds that you can do to make up for your victims\u2019 pain or loss, and if you\u2019re waiting for that to happen, you\u2019re never going to get there", "i ask questions like, \u201cwho would you be if you chose to forgive yourself", "why aren\u2019t you forgiving yourself, or why aren\u2019t you forgiving somebody else?\u201d i tell them, \u201cthink back to the most painful thing that has ever been done to you \u2013 the person who\u2019s offended you the most, or the person that you cannot forgive or refuse to forgive", "\u201cwhen you think back to that incident, what are the feelings that brew in your heart?\u201d the answers are usually revenge, vengeance, hate, depression, pain \u2013 i\u2019ve never heard of a good thing", "i\u2019m like, \u201call right, you have a choice here", "do you want to keep that big ball of hate all to yourself", "think of the last time that your hate decided for you", "when we don\u2019t forgive ourselves or others, we live in the past.\u201d at defy, our program is called ceo of your new life", "we\u2019re all here, and tim, i bet every one of your listeners is here because they want a better future", "so, if you chose unforgiveness, you\u2019re choosing to be shackled by your past \u2013 your own past decisions or your feelings of negativity about somebody else \u2013 and the people i serve are physically incarcerated \u2013 their bodies are locked up \u2013 but we\u2019re the only ones who can incarcerate our minds and hearts", "i know so many people on this side of the fence \u2013 who are not incarcerated \u2013 who live like they\u2019re locked up because you pound your brain with hateful messages that keep you from living your best", "so, what i say is if you want forgiveness, it\u2019s actually quite simple", "people say, \u201coh, it sounds easier than it is.\u201d actually, it\u2019s really simple", "say, \u201ci forgive myself\u201d or \u201ci forgive him.\u201d i\u2019m a super stubborn person, so i say, \u201cget stubborn about forgiveness\u201d because if i say, \u201ci forgive me\u201d \u2013 like, \u201ci forgive me for my scandal\u201d \u2013 then two seconds later, my brain is going to shoot back, \u201cno, you don\u2019t, you loser", "you suck\u201d \u2013 that whole negative message", "so, if i get stubborn about forgiveness, i say, \u201cno, brain", "i forgive me", "i forgive me", "i forgive me.\u201d i say it over and over again", "the next morning, i guarantee you that my stubborn is going to wake up and tell me how much i suck again, and i overpower it", "it\u2019s not just me, but if i can find a friend who believes in grace and second chances, i can tell them, \u201ci\u2019m struggling with this", "my brain is telling me how much i suck", "do you forgive me, even if i didn\u2019t offend you?\u201d if that person washes the dirty water in my own brain, it\u2019s pretty helpful", "at defy, i think a reason why our amazing ceos \u2013 we have 4,400 volunteers, and i think people keep coming back to us because when they\u2019re there in prison with us \u2013 we have events outside of prison, too \u2013 people are part of a community that rallies around shared values of forgiveness and second chances", "i don\u2019t care how fancy your credentials are", "when you\u2019re in prison, you\u2019re just a human who has made mistakes, and even though you\u2019ve made those mistakes, you are lovable, you are acceptable, you are worthy, and you are good enough, and if you come with us, you\u2019re going to feel that in your bones", "so, get stubborn about forgiveness", "if there\u2019s one message i could share with the world, if there\u2019s one impact i could have, i don\u2019t think it would even be about prison", "it would be, \u201cchoose forgiveness for yourself and for others who have hurt you", "if you forgive them, one day, your feelings may catch up, but it might help you to reshape a whole new future.\u201d you mentioned a few things that i\u2019d love to repeat for myself as much as anyone else and maybe explore a bit", "the first is \u201chope is a cure for violence.\u201d i think that\u2019s \u2013certainly true in many different senses, whether that is violence towards others or violence towards yourself", "that violence towards yourself can just be the incessant, berating, self-loathing, and self-flagellation, which is something that i\u2019ve vastly improved in the last 6 to 12 months for a host of reasons that we don\u2019t have the bandwidth to get into right now, but that was the constant companion that i had for 20-35 years, whatever the total span of time was", "i\u2019d also say that affirmations \u2013 as cheesy as they might sound, and people who are old enough to remember stuart smalley and the mirrors \u2013 i don\u2019t know if you remember that name at all, but, \u201ci\u2019m good enough, and gosh darn it, people like me.\u201d i think it was saturday night live", "i think it was al franken, now senator, right", "crazy", "in any case, the fact of the matter is that many of the people i\u2019ve had on this podcast use affirmations in different forms", "scott adams, the creator of dilbert, is one example", "he has used affirmations in many different ways over time and credits many of his biggest career successes to affirmations, so it\u2019s not just for entrepreneurs-in-training who you work with", "there is a place for that", "the next is something you didn\u2019t say, but it has been suggested by our mutual friend seth that i ask you about it, and it\u2019s a quote", "i don\u2019t know the context or the background, so maybe you can give it to me", "\u201cyou can\u2019t be angry and curious at the same time.\u201d yeah, i learned that from a friend of mine named dan tocchini, who does some of the character development courses, but i\u2019ve seen that in my life", "when i\u2019m angry, my brain seems to think it\u2019s really right about whatever i\u2019m angry about, and so, if i realize that my brain can\u2019t be angry and curious at the same time, if i choose to set aside my own judgments or need to be right, then i can ask questions, and a lot of what we do at defy is working on creating empathy and understanding where the other side is coming from", "it\u2019s amazing what a case i can build in my own brain, but then, when i start to understand the other person\u2019s pain or point of view, how wrong i can be", "what would be an example of a situation or a concrete example of an \u201cother side,\u201d just so we can conjure an image for people of what this looks like in action", "any time i\u2019m in a fight or an argument with anybody", "i\u2019m like, \u201cmy side is right because i believe this, and you\u2019re wrong, and my decision is the right way to go.\u201d especially when i\u2019m making a decision that i think is based on a lot of experience or data, it\u2019s so easy for my brain to just jump to that conclusion, and that\u2019s arrogance", "sometimes, it\u2019s experience or whatever you can call it, but maybe i\u2019m completely missing something new about this situation, or maybe i\u2019m actually right about my conclusion or decision about a certain business situation, for example", "but, maybe i\u2019m completely missing the way that i\u2019m making someone feel through my decision, and if the way that i\u2019m making that person feel is important to me, then maybe i should reconsider my course of action as well", "does that make sense", "yeah, it does make sense", "i wanted to clarify one other thing you said earlier, which was the morning meditation on beliefs", "can you walk us through what your entrepreneurs-in-training are actually doing each morning", "what does a session look like", "so, there are self-limiting beliefs, which is the negative tape that is playing in our brain whether we realize that tape is playing or not, and then, the exercise is to replace the self-limiting beliefs with self-freeing beliefs", "now, according to our course in self-limiting beliefs, these can be lies that we sometimes don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re telling ourselves because we adopted them through experiences that we might have had when we were 3 years old", "we can have self-limiting beliefs about ourselves, about other people, about god \u2013 really, about anything", "so, i\u2019ll give you an example", "one of our eits was telling me that when he was 3 years old, he was found by cps in a dumpster", "child protective services", "child protective services literally found him in a dumpster, and that was in his file", "so, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not, the self-limiting beliefs that could form out of being found in a dumpster could be, \u201cnobody loves me,\u201d \u201ci can never trust authorities,\u201d \u201ci do not belong,\u201d \u201ci was not wanted in the world,\u201d \u201ci am trash.\u201d there are so many self-limiting beliefs that could come out of that", "if we never take a moment to realize the values that have shaped us and where they came from \u2013 because values are often just handed to through us through our parents, or a lack of parents, or religion, or culture", "so, if that guy never stops to think about that, then he\u2019s now an adult man \u2013 30 years old \u2013 thinking, \u201ci am a piece of trash.\u201d well, if we think that we\u2019re a piece of trash \u2013 and this relates to \u201chope is a cure for violence\u201d \u2013 if i think i\u2019m a piece of trash who will never amount to anything, why not just go do destructive things", "sometimes, if i do destructive things, i get attention for it, and sometimes hurting myself feels good", "sometimes, it makes me feel alive when i feel like i\u2019m not worth of living anyway, so i\u2019ll continue to hurt other people and throw myself away because from what i learned, my dad was in prison, too, and i belong in this place", "well, if that guy is able to replace these values with positive ones that he can find from a program like defy, that he can find from positive friends, that he can find from most religions universally, like \u201cmy life matters,\u201d \u201ci can have a purpose \u2013\u201d what we tell people when they\u2019re writing their self-freeing beliefs is if you go from a self-limiting belief to an unrealistic self-freeing belief, then you\u2019re feeding yourself something that your brain is never going to believe", "for example, say you\u2019re not a very good-looking human being and your self-limiting belief is, \u201ci am ugly; therefore, i will never get a date.\u201d well, if you replace that with a self-freeing belief of, \u201ci\u2019m a supermodel and i can date anyone i want,\u201d your brain will know that you\u2019re trying to trick yourself, and it\u2019s not going to be effective", "but, if you replace that with a self-freeing belief that says, \u201ci have some really nice features, and i know that some people will appreciate me for who i am, and i have a great personality; therefore, i am capable of finding love in my life.\u201d i just made that up on the spot, but that\u2019s a much more realistic version than \u201ci\u2019m a supermodel.\u201d so, if the person who was found in a dumpster replaces his self-limiting belief with, \u201ci know that i matter to some people in life, and i don\u2019t matter to everybody, but i\u2019m okay even when some people don\u2019t see my value because i do have a community of people who see value in me,\u201d and, for example, their defy mentors and fellow eits reinforce that message for them, that\u2019s a reality that can change your life and your future", "if you think that you matter in the world, and that you\u2019re not a piece of trash, and if you say, \u201ci have the ability to develop skills and an education that will land me a job", "i have the ability to not only stay out of prison, but to start a legal business that will thrive", "i know that i am in a program that supports me toward my goals,\u201d then you\u2019re actually going to start working that way", "and, when you meditate on that every single morning \u2013 and, 30 days is not enough to reverse a lifetime of negative brain trash and experiences that back up the brain trash \u2013 if you meditate on that, you might actually see that become true for you", "so, i\u2019ve done this in my own life, and i\u2019ve seen so many of my own lies in my head turn", "for example, some of our male eits were abandoned by their mother, who is a drug addict, or they were cheated on by their girlfriends or their wives, so they\u2019re like, \u201ci will never trust another woman.\u201d so, that\u2019s a self-limiting belief, and i say, \u201chow has that been serving you in your life?\u201d a self-freeing belief that might replace that is, \u201ci have developed judgment and discernment to know that there are some people who will not have my best interests at heart, but there are other people that i can trust and am willing to trust.\u201d so, that\u2019s a more mature, self-freeing belief that might lead to other opportunities in our lives", "and, when you say \u201cmeditate on it\u201d in the morning, is that reading a list over and over again for a set period of time", "yup", "great questions", "is it reading them out loud", "is it memorizing them", "what is it", "yes, yes", "reading it to yourself is great", "reading it quietly is nice", "reading it aloud is better", "and then, we have them partner up, and then we have a partner pound it into their brain", "so, have someone say it to you with conviction", "one of our eits said something i love", "\u201cnow, every morning, when i wake up, i look in the mirror, and i say, \u2018i love you.\u2019\u201d what would all of us in this world \u2013 who would we be if we woke up every morning and we said in the mirror with conviction, \u201ci love you, i believe in you, you can do it, today will be awesome\u201d", "if we actually believe that about ourselves, we have no idea how much we\u2019re capable of, how many good and beautiful acts we\u2019re capable of", "hear, hear", "what are some of the ingredients that make defy uniquely \u2013 not necessary unique, because that implies that all of the rest are not \u2013 but, uniquely effective or effective", "i\u2019ll give you an example", "you don\u2019t need the time, but i\u2019ll buy some time anyway, and i\u2019ll use a different environment", "i went to my first tony robbins event about three or four years ago, \u201cunleash the power within.\u201d there are many things that you do during this event", "there\u2019s the fire walk, there are many different practices, exercises, partner drills, jumping up and down \u2013 you name it", "it\u2019s like rave plus pentecostal church plus tony robbins, for whom i have an extremely high degree of respect and admiration", "i\u2019ve gotten to know him over the past couple of years", "all of that said, you have many different tools in the toolkit that are presented, and one of them is something called the dickens process, which i won\u2019t get into right now, but that exercise is the reason one of my friends, who is a very successful ceo, has gone to \u201cunleash the power\u201d 10 or 11 times", "it\u2019s primarily on an annual basis to have tony lead this exercise called the dickens process", "now that i think about it, it\u2019s specifically to identify self-limiting beliefs and replace them", "what are some of the tools in the toolkit or the ingredients that make defy effective", "our volunteers regularly say that our \u201cstep to the line\u201d exercise is one of the most eye-opening, profound experiences \u2013 not just of defy, but of their lives", "we build empathy through it", "some of our volunteers have said that it\u2019s like free therapy", "we talk about forgiveness at the line", "\u201cstep to the line if you haven\u2019t forgiven yourself", "step to the line if you haven\u2019t forgiven someone else.\u201d i issue a challenge like, \u201cstep to the line if not forgiving yourself or others is still hurting you to this day,\u201d and then, to everyone at the line, i say, \u201cyou know what time it is now", "choose", "\u2018i forgive me.\u2019\u201d so, \u201cstep to the line\u201d is a really powerful exercise, and it\u2019s not just for our volunteers", "for our entrepreneurs-in-training, we create an incredibly emotional and physical safe place, even in prison, even in a maximum-security prison, where people can let their tough-guy or -girl guards down and just be human, and be seen, loved, and accepted for who they are", "i think that\u2019s something that all of us want in life, is to be seen and known, and to not have to put up a fa\u00e7ade", "it\u2019s so relaxing when we actually realize that we can just be us, and \u201ci am good enough.\u201d so, \u201cstep to the line\u201d is a really special, unique ingredient of what we do that is empathy-inducing and grace-inducing", "and then, we do a lot of other things", "so, at defy events, we do the worm, where we go up and down", "we get legally high in prison", "it\u2019s actually a lot of fun", "we do something called the \u201cinnovative dance,\u201d where you have to get from one side of the sweaty gym to the other using an innovative move", "a lot of our volunteers are 40- and 50-year-old white dudes who have no dance moves, but \u2013 it must be an amazing scene to behold", "it is really wonderful", "we tell the guys in prison, \u201ctwerk at your own risk", "ladies, keep below the waist immobile.\u201d it\u2019s not totally equal opportunity in a guys\u2019 prison", "so, they don\u2019t have to be good dance moves", "we say, \u201ckeep them rated g for \u2018goofy,\u2019\u201d but we use a lot of fun emotion and intensity, and then we use our love of the entrepreneurial journey to bring out the best in people, so everything we do at defy \u2013 not everything, but almost everything \u2013 is super competitive, and our eits are delivering these shark tank pitches, and the volunteers are giving feedback, and it brings out the best in people", "and then, we turn the tables", "i\u2019m big on leveling the playing field all the time", "sometimes, these fancy ceos and vcs come to prison, and they\u2019re going to be the shark tank judges", "that\u2019s great", "well, at one point in the day, the eits all get voting tickets, and i\u2019m like, \u201call right, the judges have been voting on your business ideas all day long", "now, it\u2019s the eits\u2019 turn", "so, volunteers, get your toes at the line.\u201d they all line up at this stretchy line of duct tape through the gym, and i tell them, \u201cput your hands up with your best beggar\u2019s body language with puppy-dog eyes, language that says, \u2018choose me!\u2019\u201d then, the eits go, and they have ten tickets, and there are sometimes 70 volunteers in the gym, and they walk up to the volunteer, look them in the eyeballs, and they say, \u201ctim, i choose you,\u201d and that\u2019s all they\u2019re allowed to say", "and then, the volunteers compete for who gets the most tickets and we see who the top volunteer is", "we tell the eits, \u201cpick the ones who were the best judges, who gave the best feedback.\u201d so, when the volunteers don\u2019t get as many tickets, i say, \u201clook, you can say the system is rigged, and you can suck your thumb the whole bus ride home and say you hate defy, or \u2013 just like we say at defy \u2013 you can use the feedback to up your game, come back, and be a better judge the next time around.\u201d and so, a big thing that we do at defy \u2013 we are a nonprofit organization", "we work with people who have been through a lot of things, who have done a lot of things, but one of our driving values is \u201cpartner not pity.\u201d if you come to prison with us, tim \u2013 or anybody else \u2013 you will see", "when i lead an event, i instruct people, \u201cyou are not to feel sorry for anyone here", "this is not some hug a thug event to come and feel sorry for these guys", "look at them in the eye with respect and empathy.\u201d that is so empowering, awesome, fun, and magical", "our volunteers leave prison and it leaves a real mark on them", "it gives them something to think about for their own lives, and many of our volunteers leave saying, \u201cwow, i can be doing so much more.\u201d they feel inspired by the drive of our amazing eits", "so, our events are super high-energy", "i like to think we\u2019re a little tony robbins-esque", "that\u2019s part of the reason i brought him up", "there\u2019s certainly some shared dna", "i\u2019m a big fan", "yeah, he\u2019s an impressive, very effective guy", "i did want to revisit one thing you mentioned because it caught my eye when i was reading the \u201cabout us\u201d page on defyventures.org, and it is the following: \u201cdefy offers a suite of services that includes intensive personal and leadership development, competition-based entrepreneurship training, executive mentoring, financial investment, and business incubation.\u201d can you talk a little bit more \u2013 we don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time on it, but \u201ccompetition-based\u201d is very interesting to me", "why \u201ccompetition-based,\u201d and how do you do it right versus not do it right", "well, i\u2019m a competitor, and i believe that competition \u2013 done the right way \u2013 can bring out the best in all of us", "and so, when we have 100 eits in prison \u2013 by the way, we also run these competitions outside of prison for real business ideas", "inside prison, it\u2019s an ideation competition, and outside prison, there are actual incorporated businesses that are competing for real capital", "inside prison, when we have 100 guys who are competing, we ask them the night before, \u201cwho\u2019s going to win?\u201d all these guys raise their hands", "first of all, the people that we work with are very competitive, tough, and like to win, and many of the people that we work with \u2013 if i tell them, \u201ci bet you can\u2019t do it,\u201d they\u2019ll puff their chest out, and they\u2019ll do it, and they\u2019ll defy a lot of odds", "so, we make sure that we have the affirmation", "we tell them, \u201ci know you can do it.\u201d sometimes, there are people who are lacking in confidence, and we go a long way to reassure them and tell them that they can do it", "we also tell them, \u201cwhen you\u2019re competing tomorrow in our pitch competition, this is not just about you", "this is about what we\u2019re doing in our country", "other people wish that they could be you right now, participating in defy.\u201d we get stacks of jail mail at defy from all over the country from people who say, \u201cplease, all i want is a second chance.\u201d so, they all want to win the competition, and we have quarterfinals, semifinals, and then we have finals, and the top 5 finalists get these iou checks from this stage that they get to cash out when they\u2019re admitted into our post-release incubator when they want to start their actual business if they want to", "i don\u2019t care if they want to start their business", "we get them into jobs when they get out of prison, and that\u2019s why we have a 95 percent employment rate", "but, the night before, when we\u2019re at a pitch practice, and the guys are so nervous about the competition, and some of them \u2013 the first time we ever had a competition in prison for defy, the warden called the night before and said, \u201ccan you come in here", "these guys are having anxiety attacks and they\u2019re crying.\u201d at this particular prison, more than half of the guys had committed the crime of murder, so these are tough guys", "i walked in there like, \u201cwhat", "you guys are crying and thinking about dropping out", "don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a bunch of chickens now", "when you robbed that bank, or did this or that, you didn\u2019t let your fear stop you from doing what you wanted to do.\u201d and, i\u2019m playing with them, and they laugh, but then i tell them, \u201ci believe in you, i know you can do this, and i know that for the past year\u201d \u2013 defy takes about a year to complete inside, and they take 100 courses, and some of these courses are taught by harvard and stanford mba professors, and some are taught by therapists that are doing deep inner work, and it\u2019s this whole journey", "when they finish it, they earn \u2013 our curriculum has been vetted by baylor university\u2019s mba program", "so, the next day, they\u2019re about to receive a baylor university mba program certificate", "our men, women, and youth that we serve average an eighth-grade education", "so, i tell them the day before, \u201cfor many of you, this is the biggest accomplishment of your lives", "raise your hand if this represents the biggest accomplishment of your life.\u201d 90 percent of them raise their hand", "\u201craise your hand if this is going to be your first time in a cap and gown.\u201d for half of them, it\u2019s the first time in a cap and gown", "\u201craise your hand if your family is coming tomorrow to witness your proudest moment.\u201d half of them \u2013 not all of our families can make it", "and then, i tell them, \u201cguess what", "i know that for the past year, you have been working on your pitch,\u201d but only about 20 or 30 percent of defy\u2019s program is around entrepreneurship and their pitch", "the other 70 percent is around employment readiness, shame reduction, forgiveness, technology skills, parenting courses and all that", "so, i tell them, \u201calthough you\u2019ve been working for the past year on your pitch, and you feel like your life is on the line, guess what", "your life is not on the line", "tomorrow, if you fail in your pitch, you are not a failure", "more than that, i do not care about your pitch.\u201d they all kind of look at me", "they feel offended when i say that", "\u201ci really don\u2019t care about your pitch", "i care about you, and i care about your future, and i have given so many pitches in my life, and sometimes i give a great one, and sometimes i\u2019m like, \u2018man, i bombed that,\u2019 and your pitch doesn\u2019t matter", "you and your future are what matter, and you are arriving to this moment of graduation, and you are crossing the stage and earning your mba certificate, making your families proud, and making yourself proud", "you have defied the odds", "\u201chow many of you have thought about quitting at some point in defy?\u201d every hand goes up", "i\u2019m like, \u201csee", "sometimes you guys say that quitting is not an option", "guess what", "quitting is always an option", "you just chose not to take that option", "i am proud of you", "i am proud of what we are accomplishing together", "our country needs to see more success stories like yours of people who have made grave mistakes and who are getting back on their feet and trying again", "you could have given up on yourselves, you could have given up on your future, and you could give up on being a father going forward", "\u201cso, i\u2019ll tell you what: i care about your pitch because i care about you", "i really don\u2019t care about your pitch, but because you want to win and you\u2019re competitive, tough guys, i care about your pitch", "so, when you stand up tomorrow, there is going to be a panel of five to ten of these sharks", "first of all, these sharks want you to win", "they\u2019re coming here because they believe in second chances and underdogs", "\u201cwhen you stand up in front of the panel, what\u2019s the worst thing that could happen?\u201d they\u2019re pretty funny", "they\u2019re like, \u201ci pass out,\u201d or \u201ci forget my words,\u201d or \u201ci freeze up,\u201d or \u201ci look stupid.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cwhat\u2019s worse than that?\u201d one of them once said, \u201ci defecate myself.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cyeah, that would suck", "but, the worst thing that would probably happen is that maybe you freeze up and forget some of your words", "if you stand up in front of the panel and just go, \u2018uhhhh,\u2019 and can\u2019t think of a single word, you still win", "you graduate", "you cross the stage", "you make yourself proud", "you make our country proud.\u201d and then, they graduate, and they deliver their pitches in an amazing way every time", "they surprise themselves with what they\u2019re able to do", "is there a place where people can learn more about the curriculum that you use", "yeah", "our website, defyventures.org \u2013 we\u2019re a nonprofit \u2013 has a lot of information about defy", "so, we have 100 courses inside, 100 courses outside, and with our donors, we even share some of our online courses, which are amazing", "so, in prison, people don\u2019t usually have online access, so our courses are dvd-based", "outside, they\u2019re on an online platform, so for our donors, we are even able to share them because i tell our volunteers, \u201ci don\u2019t just want our guys to forgive themselves and be the ceos of their new lives, i want you to live your fullest life, too.\u201d so, we\u2019re happy", "sharing is caring", "i\u2019m looking at the resources section on defyventures.org right now", "what about the actual classes themselves, those that have been vetted by baylor and so on, the actual content of what you are teaching", "is that available anywhere", "we don\u2019t just make it available to anybody", "for example, some of our courses that are taught by henry cloud, a top therapist, or the harvard and stanford mba courses \u2013 harvard and stanford don\u2019t want us just making that available to anybody", "it\u2019s available to people who are in our program, so i guess you have to go commit a felony first", "but, most of our courses don\u2019t actually have those kinds of restrictions on them, and we\u2019re happy to make those available to people, but my little hook is, \u201ci want you doing something for second chances in our country", "so, don\u2019t just come and take a course", "become a contributor, too.\u201d if you become a contributor to defy, we would be glad to make our \u2013 we make our courses available on our online platform where you have to have the secret code, but we make our online courses available because i want our volunteers to have access to this amazing stuff, too", "for example, we have eight courses in etiquette training taught by an emily post instructor, and many of our volunteers have told me, \u201cis there any way that my husband can get access to those courses?\u201d i say, \u201csure, if you\u2019ll make him watch them.\u201d so, yes, we\u2019d be glad to share the resources", "cool", "just to come back to something you mentioned in passing as we were chatting, if i were ever to join you at a prison \u2013 i\u2019m happy to do that, so we can figure out the specifics of that visit at some point \u2013 i think it\u2019d be very helpful to \u2013 is that a commitment, tim", "did i just hear that", "is that something that\u2019s going to get cut out", "yeah, that\u2019s a commitment", "sure", "tim ferriss comes to prison with your hundred closest friends who sign up from this podcast", "love it", "yes, we\u2019ll figure out the specifics of that", "i do think \u2013 i want people to know what cat just did there", "that\u2019s a very seasoned pitch artist at work closing the deal", "i\u2019ve got sales skills", "even just having the names of the courses that you\u2019re incorporating from stanford, gsb, and elsewhere would be a very useful way to drive traffic to your site, also", "i will make sure that we update our website before this podcast is launched", "perfect, so people can check it out", "seth godin has taught multiple courses for us on ideation strategies", "jerry colonna has taught a course on the fear of the entrepreneur and how to get to the other side of that", "union square venture capitalists \u2013 we\u2019ve recorded live pitches of our released men and women pitching in their offices and the feedback that we\u2019re giving to entrepreneurs", "tim draper has taught a course for us", "kleiner perkins \u2013 one of the partners from there \u2013 has recorded a course", "so, we have amazing courses in entrepreneurship that range from how to come up with a smart business idea to how to scale it", "we have courses in how to market your business, hiring and firing, and culture", "but, the other 70 percent of our courses are on parenting \u2013 for example, how to answer tough questions, like when your kid asks you, \u201cdaddy, have you ever used drugs?\u201d, what you should say about that", "so, the parenting courses and the \u201cforming a new identity\u201d courses are really valuable", "i also like to think that our employment series is pretty sweet", "i teach a course called \u201chow to write a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when you\u2019ve done 19 years in prison,\u201d and the creative things that you can come up with to put on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without lying about it", "yeah", "i would imagine the additional skills or special skills section could be very improvised", "with the time that we have remaining, let me jump into a number of questions that i like to ask towards the tail end of a conversation like this", "can you ask me about the book", "oh, yeah", "i\u2019m going to get there", "so, the first question i was going to ask you, which is going to naturally lead there, is what books have you gifted the most to other people", "or, do you regularly give books to other people", "i regularly give books to other people, and up until recently, the book that i have most regularly gifted is sheryl sandberg\u2019s book option b because it\u2019s closely related to the work that i do, and sheryl is the most inspiring woman that i know", "i really respect her", "she\u2019s on my executive council", "i love her book option b on healing and building a new future", "i feel very spoiled that sheryl wrote the forward to my own book, which is called a second chance", "so, now, the book that i\u2019m gifting even more than option b is my own book, a second chance", "where can people find that", "amazon", "and, seth godin has been working as my pro bono publisher", "every dollar from the book goes directly to creating life-changing opportunities for people through scholarships for defy, so it\u2019s not going into a publisher\u2019s pocket", "speaking of gifting, seth is buying and has donated 20,000 copies of the book back to defy", "he\u2019s so generous to us, and i\u2019m really inspired by his generosity, and sheryl sandberg\u2019s generosity, and the way that they have supported our second chance work", "i hope that this book \u2013 yes, it will open the eyes of people about topics that we\u2019ve been talking about for the incarcerated, but my greater purpose for the readers of this book, a second chance, is that they will decide to give themselves a second chance", "i talk a lot about forgiveness, like we\u2019ve talked about, tim, that you will choose to forgive or give a second chance to other people in your life, or if you know other people who have made big mistakes who are down on themselves, that you\u2019ll use this book as a resource for them to achieve freedom as well", "yeah", "the context in which seth first reached out to me was related to the book, so i encourage everybody to check it out for sure \u2013 a second chance", "the idea is if people who have royally screwed up their lives and the lives of other people can forgive themselves and gain forgiveness from other people, get back on their feet, start legal businesses, and build an incredibly successful new future, you can do it, too", "many of us suffer from this shame of \u201cmine is worse than yours.\u201d \u201coh, if you really knew what i did, mine is worse.\u201d \u201cmine is not recoverable.\u201d that\u2019s a message that plays inside our heads, and i don\u2019t think it\u2019s true", "yours isn\u2019t worse", "you\u2019re human, and you can bounce back, too", "it\u2019s also not helpful, if that makes sense", "even if it is worse, it\u2019s the replaying of that story", "using that as your defining narrative is not going to help create the future that you want to have", "right", "you have a choice", "you can keep yourself locked up in your head over a past decision forever or we can help you to get out of your own prison", "it\u2019s your choice", "yup", "if you could have a message on a billboard \u2013 metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions of people \u2013 it could be one line, not an advertisement, but just a word, expression, or quote from someone else, what would you put on that billboard", "it can\u2019t be an advertisement, so i can\u2019t say, \u201cgive me all your money", "show me the money.\u201d i would say, \u201cforgive yourself,\u201d and maybe i would put it in vegas, but i think a better place than vegas would be \u2013 i have a big heart for people who live in a culture of judgment and oppression", "sometimes, well-meaning religions, for example, can create this environment where we can say that we\u2019ve sinned in the past, or we\u2019ve made a mistake in the past, but now, when we show up at church on sunday, we\u2019re all wearing the perfect outfit \u2013 \u201chow\u2019s your wife?\u201d \u201cblessed.\u201d \u201chow\u2019s your job?\u201d \u201cgreat.\u201d \u201chow are you?\u201d \u201chappy.\u201d there\u2019s a culture of oppression", "i believe that sin thrives in secrecy", "if there\u2019s an audience, i say, \u201cforgive yourself", "you\u2019re just human.\u201d it\u2019s especially in environments where people are forced to act as if they\u2019re more perfect than others", "for example, that might be in the deep south, where there\u2019s religion", "it might be at stanford business school, where everyone has to be the a-plus student, too, and has to be the very best", "mm-hmm", "what do you do when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, or temporarily unfocused, or that you\u2019ve lost your focus \u2013 when you\u2019ve lost your mooring, so to speak \u2013 any of the above", "what do you do in a practical, tactical sense it depends on how overwhelmed i\u2019m feeling", "if i\u2019m feeling sort of overwhelmed, then i\u2019ll make a list of my priorities, and i will bounce them off of a staff member that i really trust to help me to get my priorities straight because when i have clear marching orders and priorities, it helps me to be less overwhelmed", "when you say \u201cbounce them off of them,\u201d what are you asking them to do", "what does that look like", "i\u2019ll show them the list and say, \u201ccan you help me decide what is really important and what i can say no to?\u201d sometimes, the more overwhelmed i get, the worse i become as a decision-maker, and things can get cloudy", "so, i recently read the book essentialism, and i loved the little framework for making decisions, and i shared that with some staff that helps me to control my calendar, and opportunities, and what to say yes or no to", "so, if i get overwhelmed, i\u2019ll say, \u201call right, let\u2019s take a step back.\u201d i also have a one-sheet with my priorities right in front of me, and i look at it every day, and it says, for example \u2013 my favorite place to be is in prison because i love the journey, transformation, and amazing \u2013 i feel like i see miracles every day", "but, my sheet says, \u201cif i really love our eits, my strict no", "1 responsibility will be fundraising so that i can make sure that i\u2019m creating more opportunities for people who are incarcerated who have been praying for a shot at a second chance.\u201d so, i keep my priorities, not just at the top of my mind, but physically in front of me", "i need to be able to see it", "and then, i\u2019ll ask other people for help", "i\u2019ll say, \u201ctime out.\u201d when i get super overwhelmed, i\u2019ll actually take a time out and cancel stuff", "i need to have some space", "monthly, i take what i call a monk day, with no phone and no email", "it\u2019s one of the best things i do", "i recommend it to everybody", "does that typically fall on a certain day of the week", "no", "it can be any day, but it\u2019s during the week", "i don\u2019t do it during the weekend", "it\u2019s a time for me to reflect on my leadership, my priorities, and my new initiatives", "it\u2019s when i get creative", "my whole life is so extroverted", "i travel all the time, i\u2019m speaking on a stage, i\u2019m in prison, and my life is like a flurry", "and so, quiet reflective time is deeply important to me, and it\u2019s usually when i scheme up good, exciting ideas and get perspective", "when you wake up on monk day, what does it look like", "what does reflecting actually look like", "what does the monk schedule look like", "for me, monk day is just like working out", "the process leading up to it is really painful because i know that for a full day \u2013 this sounds silly \u2013 i\u2019m not going to email or be able to talk to people, so the day before, i\u2019m trying to squeeze in every last thing", "with a workout, i\u2019m usually procrastinating and trying to put it off until i start working out, and then i feel really good about it", "i try to make excuses for why i need to cancel it, but it\u2019s very important for me to stay disciplined, so i come into my monk day with a list of things that i\u2019m going to do in that monk day, which might include, \u201cgo for a long walk,\u201d or \u201cread this book,\u201d or \u201cthink about this issue.\u201d and so, my email is off, my phone is off, my staff knows they can\u2019t reach me, and i usually do something that is really nice to me to start off the day", "like what", "eat my favorite food, or \u2013 what\u2019s one of your favorite foods", "i\u2019m going to keep doing this", "sure", "i don\u2019t eat it in the morning, but an awesome medium rare steak is my favorite food", "steak, oysters, red wine \u2013 i\u2019m a happy camper", "i usually don\u2019t eat that for breakfast", "i love poached eggs", "how\u2019s that", "perfect", "but, when i do something that\u2019s kind to myself \u2013 sometimes, on a monk day, i\u2019ll even go get a massage because it chills me out, and normally, i\u2019m super hyper", "i wake up like a crazy honey badger first thing in the morning", "or, if i take a bubble bath, that calms my spirit, too", "i play sweet violin music", "i actually have baby lullabies on my playlist", "that probably sounds really creepy, but \u2013 i do things to quiet myself", "i\u2019m just imagining you eating a medium rare steak and drinking red wine while the lullabies are playing", "there\u2019s nothing wrong with that", "stop judging me", "\u00a0\u2013while doing a concentration curl with one arm", "i also have a walking treadmill desk, and i absolutely love it because i feel like when i\u2019m on it, i\u2019m being kind to myself", "i\u2019m burning free calories and i like to be fit and work out", "sometimes, the first thing i\u2019ll do on a monk day is get on my walking treadmill desk with a book that i love to read, and i just start reading it, and i start taking notes, and i have these awesome headphones, so i\u2019m blaring my little, nerdy violin or piano music, and it calms me, and it takes me out of the world, and then i start taking notes", "right before i turned 40, i had a series of really amazing monk days, and i spent the last six months of monk days before i turned 40 doing an in-depth evaluation and review of my first 40 years, thinking about my impact of the world, and thinking about what i wanted my voice and impact to be for the next 40 years", "and, i didn\u2019t make turbo plans for my 80th birthday or anything, but i have a pretty strong plan until i\u2019m 53, and that\u2019s far enough for me", "but, i felt so good about taking that time out to evaluate and say, \u201cwhat do i really want?\u201d, and then, reading a lot of books to help guide me in that direction", "so, i like to have a good plan because i\u2019m like a freight train, and if i have the right direction, i hit it in that direction", "and then, after my day off, i bounce my plans off of mentors and people who look out for me to make sure that i\u2019m making good plans", "do you have any suggested artist, album, or track for either violin or piano music, for people who want to get a taste", "oh, my gosh", "i\u2019m looking for it right now", "okay", "while you\u2019re looking for it, i can keep going", "look up \u201cbaby lullaby piano\u201d on spotify or something like that", "okay, perfect",

their songs are not the most relaxing", "they play a lot of pop songs in vitamin form, but sometimes i listen to that while i\u2019m cooking", "i like to sew a lot, too, so while i\u2019m sewing, i jam out to vitamin string quartet", "how often do you do monk days", "so, on the monk days leading up to your 40th birthday, what was the interval", "so, i have a personal monk day once a month, and i\u2019ve done this for 12 or 15 years \u2013 a long time in my life", "it\u2019s been a longstanding habit", "and then, i have separate business monk days", "so, a personal monk day is no email or phone", "on a business monk day, i can have email and work on work stuff with some of my closest colleagues, but i have no scheduled appointments, which is freedom for me because my calendar is usually scheduled too insanely", "but, on a business monk day, it\u2019s time for me to just work and get work done with staff", "i answer emails, too", "and, i have one to three of those per month", "one to three per month", "in an ideal world \u2013 and, i say \u201cideally\u201d because i haven\u2019t executed perfectly on this \u2013 but sometimes, every quarter, i\u2019ll take a three-day business monk day, and i\u2019ve sometimes even gone away for a weeklong business monk day, meaning no scheduled appointments.what i\u2019ve found to be most effective for me \u2013 this might sound silly, but when i get out of the country \u2013 so, i go to mexico by myself, i sit my butt at a cool resort, and for some reason, when i\u2019m out of the country, i won\u2019t schedule appointments or phone calls with other people, so i just work", "at defy, we\u2019re currently working on 2,400 pages of new curriculum, so it\u2019s a time for me to get away, but it\u2019s a dedicated work time away from the daily scramble", "what books helped you when you were leading up to your 40th birthday in the assessing or reassessing, planning, and so on", "closely related to that, why did the planning take you to exactly 53 years old", "so, i\u2019m terrible at randomly recalling the names of the books that i love", "i will say that the book essentialism really had a big impact on me", "it\u2019s a good book", "i\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 we can work backwards", "why 53 years", "my vision for defy is that it will serve in every major prison in america \u2013 defined as having more than 500 incarcerated people there \u2013 and every major city within my lifetime", "so, i started modeling on the back of an envelope \u2013 a little excel was involved \u2013 on a reasonable growth rate for what we can accomplish, and according to my projections, if we keep going \u2013 as of 2017, defy is in five state prison systems, so by the time i\u2019m 53, i think we can serve in every major prison and have a corresponding post-release employment and mentoring incubator", "so, if i miss the mark and i\u2019m 58, that\u2019s fine, but right now, i actually believe that we\u2019ll make it by the time i\u2019m 53", "my vision \u2013 i would love to put defy out of business by ending mass incarceration", "i know that there will always be incarceration in the world", "there doesn\u2019t always need to be mass incarceration the way that we do that in america", "what would be the defining characteristics of getting rid of mass incarceration as you\u2019re using the term", "so, america has 5 percent of the world\u2019s population and 22 percent of the world\u2019s prison population", "we love to lock people up and throw away the key", "we are the only country in the world that routinely sentences children to life in prison", "so, we have a 14-year-old who makes a bad decision, and then they\u2019re going to die in prison", "according to everything i\u2019ve seen, five years in prison is a turning point for many people", "after they\u2019ve served five years, that\u2019s long enough to take ownership and not recidivate, and there are other countries that are far more progressive about rehabilitation efforts and not just making it about punishment, but about being corrected", "so, i am looking forward to the day when 76.6 percent of people in prison don\u2019t recidivate, but beyond preventing recidivism and generational incarceration \u2013 since 70 percent of the children of incarcerated people go to prison \u2013 the other piece of this that i want to tackle is the way that we sentence people and even the way that we arrest people", "so, in our country, some people look more arrestable than others because of the color of their skin, their economic status, or how beat up their car is", "a lot of studies show that white people and black people use and sell drugs at the same rate, but in some states, if you\u2019re a person of color, you\u2019ll be sentenced to 20 times the amount of time to which a white person might be sentenced", "the brock turner case \u2013 the cute little stanford swimmer boy who raped a girl and got six months \u2013 if he were not so cute, or so white, or such a fast swimmer, he would have gotten life in prison", "and so, i look forward to working on sentencing reform efforts and bail and bond reform efforts", "right now, if you\u2019re picked up by the police, you haven\u2019t been given due process, your bail is $500.00, and you\u2019re sitting in jail and you can\u2019t prove your innocence because you don\u2019t have an attorney, you\u2019re going to sit there for maybe six months until they wear you out, and then they convince you to plead guilty to a charge", "if you don\u2019t have economic resources to get a good attorney, you\u2019re probably going to plead guilty, and they\u2019ll tell you, \u201cif you plead guilty to this lesser felony or misdemeanor, it won\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d in six months, maybe your girlfriend has left you, your employer has dropped you, the world has changed, and by the way, now you have a criminal history", "good luck getting a job", "and, you\u2019re super down on yourself because you just spent six months waiting in a cell, getting dehumanized every single day", "for people of color in particular, that\u2019s the kind of harshness they deal with", "the disparities in sentencing are something that i want to be able to use not just my voice or opinions, but defy\u2019s results and amazing community of supporters, to fix it", "well, i\u2019ve been very impressed with defy, and the story, and certainly, the results, which are the first thing that i look at, so i do encourage people to check out a second chance, and that\u2019ll be linked to in the show notes, which i\u2019ll remind people of shortly", "i want to come back for a second to ask you a question", "what questions do you ask yourself to help you get centered or focused", "i\u2019ll buy time by bringing up one that is a paraphrase from jerry colonna", "i\u2019ve spent a good amount of time with jerry on the phone, and one of the questions he asks that i\u2019ve found very helpful and insightful \u2013 which i\u2019m sure i\u2019m going to be mangling a little bit \u2013 is \u201chow are you complicit in the conditions that you say you don\u2019t want?\u201d so, how are you contributing to the things you say you don\u2019t want, whether those are conflicting goals, conflicting priorities, goals you have without any accountability \u2013 whatever it might be", "but, i\u2019ve found that question very helpful over the last few years", "are there any questions or exercises that you use for yourself on a regular basis", "yes", "so, when i was going through my resignation \u2013 i\u2019ve had a lot of opportunity to study what leads people to bomb out and fail, and i read a book called leading on empty by wayne cordeiro", "as a disclaimer for your audience, it has a christian spin to it", "a lot of us leaders or people who have big goals will lead on empty or drive ourselves to empty, and this book \u2013 similar to essentialism or a lot of other good business books \u2013 asks the question, \u201cwhat is the 5 percent that only i can do, and why am i spending all this time doing other things that so many other people can do, even if i can do them better in my own arrogance?\u201d so, asking myself what is my 5 percent, what is my secret sauce, and what is my gift to this world that i ask myself nearly every day", "i\u2019ve really been honing in on this lately", "i just hired a president for defy ventures, and his name is roger gordon, and i\u2019m so excited to partner with this guy", "he will run the day-to-day operations of defy because that\u2019s not me", "it\u2019s not what i like to do", "i don\u2019t love managing people", "i don\u2019t pretend that i\u2019m the best in the world at it", "but, i do know that i\u2019m highly innovative, i can see problems, and can come up with solutions", "i know that i\u2019m a strong external representative for defy, so i\u2019ll be doing more speaking engagements", "although i don\u2019t love raising money, i\u2019m good at it, so i can keep doing that", "but, i also know that i have the ability to earn the trust of the people that we work with", "for example, lately, i\u2019ve been working at reconciliation efforts within some pretty intense gang cultures, and for some reason, this white girl here is trusted enough by these people to talk about some big transformation efforts", "so, that\u2019s what i\u2019m focusing on, and i\u2019m working very hard and swiftly to get other things off of my plate", "i don\u2019t have responsibility for them \u2013 it\u2019s scary for me to lose control over them, too \u2013 but i have such an amazing staff nationally at defy now that i\u2019m glad to give away that responsibility so that i can focus on my top 5 percent", "if i died in a year, what would i spend my time doing", "i ask myself that all the time, and i know that may sound a little bit \u2013what\u2019s the word", "morbid", "morbid, yeah", "i don\u2019t care how morbid it sounds", "at defy, we have our eits write their eulogies, and i\u2019ve done that", "in fact, we have them write two eulogies", "this is a pretty good exercise that other people could try, too", "one of them is your current trajectory eulogy", "if you died now, doing your same old same old, and you didn\u2019t make major changes in your life, what would your eulogy say and how would you feel about it", "most people wouldn\u2019t be super satisfied with it", "then, we have them write their ideal but realistic eulogy", "if you lived your best life that is also realistic for you, what would that look like", "and then, the most important part is to write out the ten changes that you need to make to get from a to b, and then prioritize them and pick the top three things you can start doing today to live a better life", "so, i apply all these little defy exercises to my own life, and i guess i live in a sort of morbid sense, but time is limited for all of us, and i want to have the greatest impact in the shortest amount of time", "so, how do i use the gifts that i have been given to \u2013 this is my generous hustle", "this is my ability to share something with the world that only i can create", "well, cat, thank you for developing, sharing, and communicating your gifts with the world", "you\u2019re doing really important work", "thank you for taking the time to hang out", "maybe someday, i\u2019ll give you the chance to heel-hook me in person", "maybe we can coordinate that with the prison visit that i did commit to, so you have me on the hook for that", "and, 1)", "i really appreciate you doing what you do, but 2)", "i also appreciate you taking the time to share it today and have this conversation", "well, tim, getting to speak with you is one of the greatest honors that i\u2019ve had", "i was really excited about this because i know how influential your audience is", "am i allowed to share my email address", "we talked a little bit about this", "yes, if you\u2019re willing to get the hug of death with mass numbers of people emailing, you\u2019re welcome to share your email address", "all right, here\u2019s what i will say to anyone who\u2019s listening: if you email me, i\u2019m in prison all the time, so please keep it really short, sweet, and to the point", "i\u2019m not trying to be rude or anything", "but, if you want to get involved with defy, first of all, you can go to defyventures.org, but if you want to email me, my email address is cat@defyventures.org, and tell me if you would like to come to prison, or if you would like to have us come speak to your organization, or how you would like to get involved", "if you want to provide a scholarship to one of our eits, we would be really grateful if you would become even more of an advocate of second chances and share this message with other people because i always say, \u201cwho would our country be \u2013 who would we all be if we lived up to being the land of second chances that we claim to be?\u201d so, tim, thank you for the opportunity to share our mission and my story", "i see it as a big responsibility and a huge privilege to be a voice on behalf of people who are incarcerated who become voiceless, and often written off, and voteless", "and so, it\u2019s my honor to get to share some of our story with all of you", "thank you", "my pleasure", "everybody, check out a second chance, and for those long-term listeners, you know this part already, but as always, you can find links to everything we talked about \u2013 the books, a second chance, the defy website, and much more \u2013 in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast, where you can find the show notes for all episodes, including this one", "cat, thank you once again for the time, and it was a lovely conversation that has given me a lot of food for thought and things to look forward to, including that visit that we\u2019re going to take together", "to everyone listening, as always, thank you for listening, and until next time, keep experimenting, keep testing assumptions, and give yourself a second chance", "take a moment for forgiveness, and that will in turn affect how you are better able to forgive others", "thanks, everybody", "hey, guys", "this is tim again", "just a few more things before you take off", "1)", "this is five-bullet friday", "do you want to get a short email from me \u2013 would you enjoy getting a short email from me every friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend", "five-bullet friday is a very short email where i share the coolest things i\u2019ve found or that i\u2019ve been pondering over the week", "that could include favorite new albums that i\u2019ve discovered", "it could include gizmos, gadgets, and all sorts of weird shit that i\u2019ve somehow dug up in the world of the esoteric, as i do", "it could include favorite articles that i\u2019ve read and shared with my close friends, for instance", "it\u2019s very short", "it\u2019s just a little, tiny bit of goodness before you head off for the weekend", "so, if you want to receive that, check it out, just go to fourhourworkweek.com \u2013 that\u2019s fourhourworkweek.com, all spelled out \u2013 and just drop in your email, and you will get the very next one", "if you sign up, i hope you enjoy it"]}
