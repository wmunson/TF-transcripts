This is Tim Ferriss, [speaking foreign language], breaker of chains, mother of dragons. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job always to deconstruct world-class performers of many different varieties, pulling out the lessons, strategies, habits, etc. that you can apply and test in your own life. My guest today is none other than the comedian\u2019s comedian, Bill Burr. @billburr on Twitter. B-I-L-L B-U-R-R. Please say hello. Many of you know him as a stand-up comedian, of course. His YouTube clips have followed me around the planet, as has his podcast. He is one of the funniest humans alive. He loses his audience sometimes on purpose because making them laugh is not enough of a challenge. Then he\u2019ll reel them back in and get them back on his side. He has been requested for this podcast for many years. Rolling Stone has called him \u201cThe undisputed heavyweight champ of rage-fueled humor.\u201d When we finally got on the same stage to have a conversation and do this, he did not disappoint. So in this very wide-ranging conversation, Bill and I go all over the place. We talk about how he found his way into stand-up comedy. Why he enjoys going for an encore after he\u2019s been booed. How he started as a squeaky clean comedian and then ended up where he is now, which is quite different. How learning can serve as therapy. The importance of enjoying success, and much more. This interview comes from my TV show, Fear(less), with the less in parenthesis because the objective is to learn to fearless, not to be fearless, which is not possible. I interview world-class performers (that\u2019s probably my favorite combo word) on stage about how they\u2019ve overcome doubt, conquered fear and made their toughest decisions. You can watch the entire first episode with illusionist David Blaine for free at att.net/fearless (no parenthesis, all one word). Att.net/fearless (the way you would usually spell it). I highly recommend you check that out. To see all episodes, you can get it on DirectTV or you can go to DirectTVNow. I believe that\u2019s just directtvnow.com, but directtv.com. D-I-R-E-C-T-T-V.com and then click on DirectNow. We recorded about three hours of material on stage and only one hour was used for TV. That means this episode is almost entirely new content that did not appear on TV. So even if you saw that episode already, you\u2019re going to get a lot more patented Bill Burr. Please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation with Mr. Bill Burr. Welcome to Fear(less). I\u2019m your host, Tim Ferriss. On this stage, we\u2019ll be deconstructing world-class performers to uncover the specific tactics that they\u2019ve used to overcome doubt, tackle hard decisions, and ultimately succeed. Imagine yourself all alone on stage in front of 14,000 people staring directly at you. For many of us, probably most of us, that would be a complete nightmare, but for my guest tonight, it\u2019s just another day at the office. The man you\u2019re about to meet is one of the most prolific and respected comedians in the world. He\u2019s done five hour-long comedy specials, hosts one of the most popular podcasts of all time, and is the co-creator and star of the animated series, F is for Family. Please welcome to the stage, Bill Burr. Bill Burr: Hey, how are you? What\u2019s going on, Tim? How are you doing, buddy? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m good. Bill Burr: If you ever get booed, you\u2019ve got to come back \u2013 if there\u2019s an encore, you\u2019ve got to go back. I think you\u2019ve got to go back, so I wave. I remember this kid came running up because I trashed all of their teams because the Phillies hadn\u2019t won a World Series yet. They were like two years away from it at that point. I just remember this kid was yelling at me. He was just going, he was so mad, he\u2019s going, \u201cFuck you! Fuck you!\u201d Giving me the finger and yelling fuck you when I was standing there. He was like 30 yards away. I just kept going, \u201cWhat? What?\u201d He started going, \u201cFuck you! Fuck you!\u201d He\u2019s giving me the finger like I don\u2019t know what it is? I just kept going \u201cWhat?\u201d He was hopping mad. By the end, he was jumping up, \u201cFUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t \u2013.\u201d I was standing next to Opie and we were just laughing going, \u201cHow dumb is this kid?\u201d But then afterward, I was mortified because I knew a lot of stuff was coming up on people who had phones and had cameras. I was thinking, everyone\u2019s going to see me get booed. This is going to be embarrassing. I didn\u2019t know how it was going to play. I just thought that people weren\u2019t going to understand it. Tim Ferriss: We first connected and started texting because we know Dave Elitch, who is an amazing professional drummer. Bill Burr: And teacher. Yes, he is. Tim Ferriss: And teacher. He has a great t-shirt for you guys who are looking for t-shirts to buy. It says, \u201cMore slowly, once again.\u201d Something like that. Bill Burr: It says, \u201cSlow down,\u201d and I think it says \u201cRepeat\u201d or \u201cDo it again\u201d Tim Ferriss: Repeat or do it again on the back. He got sick of saying the same thing, so he\u2019d just point to one side of his shirt. How did you get into drumming? Why drumming? Bill Burr: How did I get into drumming? I guess everyone was into music where I grew and everything. I loved music, but I didn\u2019t start playing drums until I was almost 20 years old. I started really late. The reason for that was I was working in a warehouse. I came from a jock town, so everybody played sports, pond hockey and all that. So I did a lot of that stuff. I liked music, but there were only a couple of kids that played guitar and I wasn\u2019t around it. I didn\u2019t think it was possible. When I was watching people doing it on TV, I just didn\u2019t think you could do it. Then I started working in this warehouse and there were kids my age from a different town that was more like kids putting together bands and stuff. They were coming in with the songs I liked and they could play it. I was like wow, that\u2019s amazing. So I started playing guitar and I just didn\u2019t have the patience for it. The thing about drumming was the sports background where it was a real physical thing that it kind of came into play. I just started playing. I played for six, seven years. Somewhere during that time, I started doing stand-up. I moved to New York. Your neighbors don\u2019t mind if you\u2019re strumming a guitar. You can\u2019t play drums in a one-bedroom apartment without pissing everybody off. So I stopped for five years before I got back into it. Tim Ferriss: I grew up on Long Island. I feel like we don\u2019t have a tough accent, it\u2019s just a bad accent. Bill Burr: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a lot like the show we do. F is for Family, where it\u2019s just like the parents sent you outside. Some days you had good days. Some days you had bad days. Sometimes you just ran into bigger kids and they would just beat the shit out of you for no reason. I distinctly remember them putting in a pool one time. They were like whatever the hell it is when they\u2019re smoothing out the concrete. This older kid dared me to throw a rock into it, so I wanted his approved. I just took this big rock and this guy was just smoothing it out and I just threw it down. This guy almost killed me. He almost killed me. That\u2019s back when you could almost kill a kid and it wasn\u2019t a problem. There was no cellphone video. It was all your word against theirs. I think a lot of the reasons why I started doing stand-up was I thought I\u2019m going to get on stage, show people that I\u2019m a funny guy, and people will stop fucking with me. That was basically \u2013 I remember thinking that everything was going to fall into place. I\u2019ll meet the girl of my dreams. I\u2019ll make my money. I\u2019ll get whatever the hell I want \u2013 a house. I only worked on getting better as a comedian. By the time I got to my mid-30s, being a comedian was 600 miles down the road and everything else was at the starting block. Literally, social interactions. I kept messing up relationships. I was 36 and still sleeping on a futon in what they called was a one-bedroom apartment, which was bullshit because I met the woman who lived upstairs who had the exact same apartment and hers was a studio. They just slammed a wall into mine. I remember there was a three-year period where I was in a full-on depression and I was so detached, I wasn\u2019t even aware of it. Tim Ferriss: What was the age roughly on that period? Bill Burr: I don\u2019t know. It was like the early 2000s, late \u201890s, early 2000s. It might\u2019ve been five or six years. I can\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t worry about making it. I didn\u2019t worry about how I was going to make money. I was just like, I\u2019m doing this. When Billy got offstage, maybe it was the end of the night, I was like, who do I call for open mics? How do I do this? I remember he wrote down, \u201cRita.\u201d Rita Joyce, she used to book it. She was back then one of the big characters. You used to always run into her at a comedy club. I used to call in to do open mics. I remember once she got to know me and she thought I was kind of funny, I\u2019d call up and be like, \u201cHey, Rita. It\u2019s Bill Burr. I\u2019d like to do \u2013\u201d and she\u2019d go, \u201cNo, no, no, Bill. You call me and you say, Rita, this is Open Mic-er Bill Burr.\u201d She was always breaking balls. I would always laugh and I would do it. It was kind of like a test if you had a sense of humor about yourself. I gradually worked my way into doing stand-up. I remember one time I did a show \u2013 I\u2019ve told this before, but I did this show. I was seeing this woman when I was in New York and I remember she came over and I was making her dinner or whatever and then I had a spot at the Comic Strip, which where I was living right was around the corner. So I said, \u201cI got to go run and do a spot.\u201d During the week \u2013 she asked me, \u201cWhat do those spots pay?\u201d It was \u2013 the [inaudible] was hilarious. It was like $5.00, $8.00, $7.00. Basically, you\u2019re just going up there trying out material. I went up there and I tried out new material and it worked. I was psyched. I came home and finished cooking the dinner or whatever. I can\u2019t remember what I was making. I did this stupid dance in the kitchen and she was laughing. I was dancing because I had this new material and I was excited. She got this sad look on her face. I was like, \u201cGod, do I dance that bad? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d She goes, \u201cNo, I just wish I had a job where I got paid $8.00 and I came home and danced in a kitchen.\u201d I never forgot that. I was like, \u201cOh, yeah. I didn\u2019t even think that.\u201d I got this weird thing about money where I want to have it so I\u2019m not broke, but I don\u2019t give a shit about it. But I also don\u2019t want to have debt, so I don\u2019t overextend myself, but I don\u2019t give a shit about it. I will pay extra to not go through the process. I don\u2019t use frequent flyer miles. My wife signed me up for them but I don\u2019t use them ever because I don\u2019t want to go through the fucking logging in and all of a sudden I\u2019m working for American Airlines. I\u2019m like. I don\u2019t work for these fucking people. I\u2019ll find my own ticket. I don\u2019t want to do this. I won\u2019t cancel shit. I got gym memberships I\u2019ve never canceled because I\u2019m not going through going on that stupid thing. If you want to do this, press 1. If you want to do that, press 2. I don\u2019t know. My free time, I cherish it. I\u2019m not going to be fucking \u2013 I\u2019m not going to be laying on my deathbed just thinking about how many hours I spent on the phone going, \u201cPerson. Person. Operator! Person! Fuck you!\u201d I don\u2019t want to do that. I would rather pay the extra charge, yeah. Tim Ferriss: A little bit later, I want to pull up the \u201cnot caring about money\u201d examples that I have found most personally amusing, which are actually from your podcast. We\u2019ll get to those. Can you just place us when you were working in your Dad\u2019s office? Maybe you could describe what your Dad did. Bill Burr: Early \u201890s to mid-\u201890s. I was working in a dental office. I had been laid off from the warehouse with the guy all coked up. But my car was paid off, thank God, and I was living at home. I was living like this little existence for three months. My Dad started working with the other guy and went into practice with him. He needed \u2013 I think he was just sick of watching me being around the house. Nepotism kicked in and the next thing you know, I\u2019ve got a lab coat and I\u2019m standing next to him, handing him all the shit as he\u2019s taking teeth out and stuff. I had to get past the gross factor of that. Then I learned how to pour up models and take x-rays. I was halfway decent at it. But I knew that \u2013 for half a second I thought maybe I would do this. But what was funny was I had to call my father Dr. Burr. I couldn\u2019t call him Dad in front of a patient because that would be weird. Like, \u201cHey, Dad! Do you want this?\u201d So I had to keep it professional. When I worked there, it was around the time that I started doing stand-up. What sucked was I was still living at home. So he knew \u2013 because at the end of the night, he\u2019d be like, \u201cWhere are you working tonight?\u201d I\u2019d have a gig in Maine, living in Massachusetts. And I worked for free. I would drive up there maybe like $5, $10 gas money and I would drive all the way up. My Dad would have 7:00 patients and shit. He worked like a lunatic. Like from 7:00 to 7:00. He would side-book root canals on molars, which is three nerve involvements. We\u2019d numb up a guy and then we\u2019d go in the other room \u2013 and he didn\u2019t give a shit. I remember one time some homeless guy came in. I finally got a lunch, because you\u2019d never get a lunch with him. This guy came in, substance abuse, and he was all \u2013 all these other guys I\u2019d notice we would just give them medicine and they would leave. My Dad would be like, \u201cYeah, just get them in there and blah, blah, blah.\u201d I was pissed. I\u2019d be like, \u201cDr. Burr, what the fuck? Why can\u2019t we just get this guy \u2013\u201d. He just goes, \u201cLook, I can\u2019t go home tonight knowing there\u2019s some guy in pain and I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Did you get material for your comedy from that experience? Bill Burr: Oh, yeah. Big time. Tim Ferriss: I read the dental comedy early \u2013 and I don\u2019t know what dental comedy is. Bill Burr: I had all of it. My Dad used to set me up because he knew that \u2013 I swear to God \u2013 if I had a late show, then he would go extra fast. \u201cGive me, give me this. Christ, Bill, you\u2019re out to lunch.\u201d He would start giving me shit in front of the patients. I used to tell him, \u201cDad, you can\u2019t do that type of stuff.\u201d He was like that. But I got a lot of it out of patients. I remember this guy came in. I used to work totally, squeaky clean. Totally clean because I didn\u2019t want to offend anybody. I didn\u2019t want to get heckled because I was still this really shy person. I remember this guy came in one time and his teeth were all rotting out. I just remember he said something like, \u201cDoc, I don\u2019t understand what the problem is. I brush my teeth almost every day.\u201d That\u2019s what he said. My punchline to that was, \u201cOh, yeah? Well, do your wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit?\u201d For a while, I started closing on that joke and I would work totally squeaky clean, going up there looking like Ron Howard and everybody\u2019s like, \u201cOh, look at this wholesome guy.\u201d And then out of nowhere, I would just end with, \u201cYeah, do you wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit?\u201d And then be like, \u201cGoodnight, everybody!\u201d They\u2019d be like, \u201cDude, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I had no idea what I was doing. I actually was a prop back for a second, where I had one prop. For whatever reason, you\u2019re not allowed to have props in comedy. In acting, it\u2019s fine. I had no idea, right? So we had this dental mask \u2013 like when you really had some gnarly shit going on. They have these plastic things that look like a welder\u2019s shield, but it was all plastic. We\u2019d just \u2013 I\u2019ll spare you the details. It\u2019s for when stuff is flying at you. I used to bring that. I would take it out after I\u2019d do all the dental material. I\u2019d be like, \u201cMy job\u2019s so bad, I have to wear this at work.\u201d And I would just put it on. I had no joke. I would put it on and they\u2019d sort of chuckle and be waiting for the joke. Behind the mask, almost muffled, I\u2019d be like, \u201cGoodnight, everybody!\u201d I\u2019d just take it away and I\u2019d put it back in my little duffle bag and I\u2019d walk away. That was horrible. Tim Ferriss: How do you know when something is close and when something is done? Like when you\u2019re working on a joke or a piece of writing? How do you know when something\u2019s done? Bill Burr: Well, I think when I\u2019m touring, none of the jokes are done. Until I start getting sick of them. Then I\u2019m like, okay, I need to record these and document these because they\u2019re going to start becoming not funny. Because they\u2019re starting to feel like a job to tell them. I\u2019m sick of this joke. And ohmygod, I don\u2019t want to do this joke. This one\u2019s so long. I might not think that anymore. Sometimes those things just drop away and you never record them. I\u2019d say it\u2019s like that. Tim Ferriss: When you bombed that first time, was that at Kelley\u2019s? That third gig? Bill Burr: Yeah. Jesus, you did your research. How the hell did you find that one out? I must\u2019ve told that on another podcast. Tim Ferriss: I have a good team helping me. Magic elves in the back as well. Bill Burr: That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to cover that camera up on your flatscreen and on your laptop. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s actually really good advice. Bill Burr: It\u2019s true. They sit there and they watch you. They try to see what you\u2019re watching and shit. If you bang your wife, they\u2019re going to keep watching. Tim Ferriss: So I want to talk about last Tuesday night. I imagine the drive back after that gig was very different from the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce experience. Bill Burr: I was mortified. Tim Ferriss: What did you do to get yourself back on the horse for the next gig? What did you say to yourself before you got onstage the next time? A lot of people fall off and they don\u2019t get back on. Bill Burr: Well, I fell off a lot of things and didn\u2019t get back on. But I also always knew if I was good at something or if I wasn\u2019t. You know what I mean? As much as I loved playing drums and everything, I went to the music store enough times and saw an 8-year-old and get on a drum kit and I\u2019d be like, \u201cDude, I\u2019d pay you to take lessons.\u201d I just didn\u2019t have it. It\u2019s a hobby. It\u2019s something I enjoy doing, but I would never subject anybody to it on a professional level. This happens to me a lot with my ADD. I went down that road and now I forgot the question. Tim Ferriss: The question was \u2013 which is fine by the way \u2013 the question was how did you get back on the horse? What did you say to yourself before getting back onstage? Bill Burr: Well, it never dawned on me not to do it again. Tim Ferriss: Had you already committed to the next gig? Bill Burr: It\u2019s weird because all the other social shit the mortified me, I just stayed away from it. But that thing \u2013 I don\u2019t think I had \u2013 maybe I just was like \u2013 you know it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s like riding a motorcycle. You know one of these days, you\u2019re going to go down. You just hope you\u2019re going to live. Tim Ferriss: You talked about some dark periods earlier. I\u2019m forgetting the exact timeline. But what precipitated that? You said it was a couple of years. For people who don\u2019t know, I almost offed myself during a year off from college. I\u2019ve had some battles myself. Bill Burr: How were you going to do it? Tim Ferriss: You know what? This is a good question. I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m not going to give an answer because it was a really good plan. It was a plan that would minimize guilt or self-blaming on the part of my family. It was really well thought through. I had everything speced out. Bill Burr: Zipline in the woods into a \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, involved some porcupines, a little bit of curare, yeah. It was very complex. Hard to replicate. But yeah, I wouldn\u2019t want people to copycat it. If I put it out there. But what precipitated that period for you? Bill Burr: What does that mean? What came before that? Tim Ferriss: What triggered it? It\u2019s all right. Using weatherman language, my bad. I don\u2019t know why. It just comes out of me sometimes. Yeah, what led to it? What triggered going into that? Bill Burr: Half of you laughing didn\u2019t know what it meant either. I was just going full speed towards a wall. I thought I was normal, well-adjusted. Even though I knew I had a crazy temper, I had this period where I would be what you needed me to be. I was friends with everybody, which is not a real thing if you\u2019re being who you are. I would adjust my shit so I wouldn\u2019t cause any friction, so there wouldn\u2019t be \u2013 the shit I dealt with coming up. I had enough of people screaming and yelling. I had enough of fighting and all that stuff, that I would just adjust my behavior so then we would just be smooth. I just think using that as a gameplan, eventually, you\u2019re so going to spin away from who the hell you are, that I think that \u2013 and also just focusing on [inaudible] [00:21:25] areas of my life, I think that\u2019s when the anger and all of that stuff started to come up. Then I went like this completely different person. I really started snapping about nothing for a good 12 years. Somewhere in there \u2013 maybe I was always depressed but I didn\u2019t realize it. I think I just didn\u2019t realize it. Somewhere along the line, one of the umpteen thousand poor women that ever came across me, one of them finally told me to go to therapy. I went there thinking I\u2019m fine. Then you start telling stories and it was all this shit that I knew happened but was just hovering. It\u2019s over here going around in life then all of a sudden when you start talking about it, you say it out loud, it\u2019s like, oh, that\u2019s a real thing. That really did happen to me. Then you start thinking, wow, I\u2019m pretty fucked up. And I\u2019m not happy. I\u2019m really not happy. I really started getting conscious of what my brain was telling me. If my brain was a friend, I\u2019d be like, yeah, dude, we can\u2019t do this anymore. You\u2019re bumming me out. Jesus Christ, do you ever see the light? What the fuck? You know? Fortunately, I wasn\u2019t clinically, so I didn\u2019t need any medicine. All I just became aware of it. Then I\u2019d be like, all right, well, there\u2019s that thought. Do you want to have that thought or do you want to go to the gym? I got back into playing drums, which was a great thing. I just stopped giving a shit about making it in a way. I was just like, you know what? Forget this. I\u2019m just going to do what I do. Because I went through that whole period like \u2013 I know how many of you guys try to make it out where. You just go through that period where you\u2019re just like, oh, they like guys with blue button-down shirts and you\u2019re wearing the blue button-down shirts. People who talk about this \u2013 like in my time, it\u2019s gone from the tail-end of the sportcoat guy into the grunge guy, into the alternative scene, into the whole whatever that period was where guys in their 30s acted like they were 14 and they were awkward. You know, the hoodie? My wife called them \u2013 not baby men. Man-boys. Man-boys are what she called them. No, no, I\u2019m just awkward. Like that was this default thing. Great, now I have to hold up both ends of the conversation? Those people I kind of got hostile with. I was just like, well, when you get over that and you can fucking talk to me, yeah, you are awkward. This is weird. I also thought a lot of people that do that, it\u2019s also a passive-aggressive thing to come in and fucking steal focus and we all have to deal with how awkward you are and make sure you\u2019re okay. It\u2019s like, fuck you, dude. You\u2019re in your 30s. Figure this out. I\u2019ll never forget one time, I was in a green room in New York. I was living in L.A. I met an old friend and we were talking about the old days. Remember this guy? Remember that night when this happened? We\u2019re having a great time. Then these younger comics, they were listening. Some people who actually were in the tail-end of the stories. We\u2019re having this great time. Then this woman comes in, a comedian. She was socially awkward. She didn\u2019t know how to get into it. So we\u2019re all laughing and everything. She walked right into the middle of the circle. I swear to God, she just walked in going like, \u201cHello, hello, hello, hello.\u201d She was mocking saying hello? But then totally stole all the focus. Everyone was just like, whoa, you all right? All the fun went out of the room. Then everyone was dealing with her. Then she left. I said to my friend, \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d That was some rude shit. We were having a great time. If you don\u2019t know how to say fucking hello, learn how to do it. Don\u2019t come in and take the whole thing away and ruin this thing. That was the last time. I was like, fuck these awkward people. If you\u2019re really \u2013 I don\u2019t want to bully somebody if they really are socially awkward or something like that. I\u2019ll work with you. But if you just embraced, I\u2019m awkward now the world has to deal with it. Tim Ferriss: Right, if that\u2019s your schtick. Bill Burr: Yeah, go fuck yourself. Tim Ferriss: We also have a clip that we\u2019ll pull up in a minute from F is for Family that might \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Now that I\u2019ve seen all the episodes and now that you\u2019re telling me a lot of these stories, I can see where I think a lot of them came from. There\u2019s one clip we\u2019ll pull up in a little bit. I\u2019m not going to do it just right now. What have you found to help get you out of a depressed period? You mentioned exercise. For instance, I\u2019ve found drummers, in general, to be very happy people. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re happy and then they end up drumming or if it\u2019s because of the physical aspect of just going animal on a drum kid. It\u2019s awesome. Bill Burr: It\u2019s a great feeling. It\u2019s awesome. Tim Ferriss: I also had played the drums in college, but I was not very good at all. But that was my experience. It alleviated a lot of these darker thoughts. Bill Burr: Yeah, it\u2019s fun. Tim Ferriss: Is there anything else that you\u2019ve found particularly helpful? Bill Burr: Yeah, I just do shit. I just get up and do something that day. I like to cook and stuff, so I\u2019ll go on YouTube. What I did recently \u2013 who\u2019s the guy from Hell\u2019s Kitchen? Gordon Ramsay. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Gordon Ramsay. Bill Burr: Dude, he\u2019s got this video. Like the sickest scrambled egg you\u2019re ever going to make in your life. It\u2019s insane. I just remember watching it and I was just like, I\u2019m going to fucking make that thing. Because I have the free time. As a comedian, I could do it. I went out and bought all the ingredients and all that type of stuff. That\u2019s what I do. Or I\u2019ll learn something. I do have my hobbies like cooking and playing drums and a few other things that I do. I try to have that moment in the day to learn something or go somewhere. Working out is a big thing, that\u2019s a big thing. Tim Ferriss: How did your goals change, if they did, from when you\u2019re trying to force fit yourself? What was the pinnacle that you had in mind for making it to after? Bill Burr: For me coming up, it was all about having an HBO special. Because HBO specials, those were the best comics. That\u2019s all the great guys that I saw coming up. You got on HBO\u2019s Totally Uncensored and they were the home for that. Unfortunately, when I got into it, right in the early \u201890s, by the mid-\u201890s, they just stopped doing it for like ten years. That\u2019s when I felt rudderless because when HBO stopped doing their specials, I didn\u2019t know what to do. What Comedy Central started going the half-hours, the fact that they had commercials. I think it\u2019s eight minutes each hour. So they were automatically going to take eight minutes out of a half hour. Then they would beep out the curses with the worst, most archaic [beep, beep]. And they wouldn\u2019t just fade it down and come back up. So I remember watching specials and thinking that was really distracting. So once again, I worked clean. If you watch my first half hour on Comedy Central, I worked totally clean. I gave them the least amount of material that I could. Because it was guys going like, all right, here\u2019s a half hour, they\u2019re only going to use 22 minutes. What they would do is they\u2019d do 40. So then you had this guy who you didn\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t approve of, is now going to hack 40 minutes down to 22. What is he going to do? Exactly. So I was like, fuck that. What\u2019s the least you can do? They said the least amount of time you can do is like 25 or 26. I did exactly that. So the worst you could do was butcher four of it out, but the rest of it was going to look good, so I was happy with it. It was just kind of doing stuff like that. But it still wasn\u2019t what I wanted because it wasn\u2019t me. That half hour that I did, that was me doing an extended Letterman spot where I was working totally clean. It wasn\u2019t until HBO came back and did the half hours and I did those that I actually got to do \u2013 it was the first time people got to see me not in a club. They were at home and they got to see that this is what I do. That was the same time I got on the Opie and Anthony Show and they all kind of came out at the same time. It was the first time I went to a club and it was sold out and people were there to see me, which was a whole other level of pressure. Up until then, it was people coming to the club because that\u2019s what they did; they had nothing else to do. Like eh, let\u2019s go down to the comedy club and you had to prove to them that you were funny. I used to remember thinking, imagine if they came to see me how much easier this would be. I didn\u2019t realize the other pressure was like, no we saw that, so we\u2019re expecting at least that if not better. Then it\u2019s like, oh, man. That took me a good three months. It was a new kind of nervous experience to get over of people expecting. We\u2019re here to see you. We like what you do. Don\u2019t ruin this. Tim Ferriss: What was the first special? Bill Burr: The first half hour: Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Not the Comedy Central, but the first time you could be yourself. Bill Burr: That was the HBO half hour that I did. That was in 2005. Tim Ferriss: 2005. Bill Burr: I still remember. April 2005 and came out in sp Tim Ferriss: Is there anything since then \u2013 and this is an assumption on my part, which is dangerous, but did you feel like you had summited the mountain at that point? Did you feel like you\u2019d arrived? Bill Burr: No. I felt that somewhere in like 2009, 2010. By then, I\u2019d done a couple of hours. I\u2019d done my second hour for Netflix, which became the new HBO, as far as just totally uncensored. I think I bought a house at that point. I bought a house. I had a niche following. I was saying to my wife, \u201cI know you\u2019re not supposed to say this, but I made it.\u201d Because there\u2019s a sickness in this business of like, \u201cNo, man. If you think you made it, then you\u2019re going to relax and it\u2019s all going to go away.\u201d So I\u2019m never going to be happy? I tell dick jokes and I just bought a house. I made it. I didn\u2019t want to be that guy that is doing well and is like, oh, what about the next thing? That sickness. Tim Ferriss: The greyhound chasing the rabbit. Bill Burr: Yeah. Performance or driven people can have this sickness of it\u2019s just like you can\u2019t even enjoy it. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s the next thing? I know guys that accomplish something. As they\u2019re getting right to the peak, this depression hits them because they\u2019re like, \u201cThen what? What am I going to do when this is over? Then I got nothing.\u201d Hey, can you just fucking have a beer up here? We did this, you know? Can we enjoy this for a second? Tim Ferriss: Did you continue doing therapy after those initial sessions that you mentioned? Bill Burr: I did it for a few years. Then one day it just dawned on that I was just talking in circles. Bad shit is always going to happen to me. Am I just going to keep coming here and moaning about it? At what point am I going to grow up and not need this? I\u2019m not trying to say that you\u2019re weak if you go there, but I just hit this point where I was, you know. All of those shit happened. It happened, right? It definitely affected who I am, but now I\u2019m not going to be like lashing out at people. I\u2019ll be like, oh, I do this because of that \u2013 a little bit of that. At some point \u2013 like if somebody\u2019s teaching you how to fix a car \u2013 at some point, you\u2019ve got to try to fix it yourself. You can\u2019t be like, turn right here. How do I do this? It just became like that. Now I self-therapy myself. It\u2019s cheaper. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned the delusion maybe of always chasing the next thing and never being satisfied with where you are. The other worry that I\u2019ve heard a lot from friends of mine who are comedians is that if they do therapy or meditation or fill-in-the-blank to tone down some of their tendencies, that it will make them less funny. Is that something you \u2013 Bill Burr: I thought that was true. No, it\u2019s not true. What it does is it gives you insight into you as a human and then you see people differently. It actually allowed me to think about characters and just notice shit with people that I never did before. I got a thing with somebody. Anybody who does this when they\u2019re talking. Like I worship blah, blah, blah. They\u2019re full of shit. No. Not only are they full of shit, they have a complete inability to accept responsibility for anything they\u2019ve ever done. I just recently told this to Jim Norton. It was that publicist who backed over those 12 people in Long Island. I remember she drove away and then she went to her house. When she got to her house, the cops showed up and the lawyer met them in the driveway and was like, \u201cYeah, she\u2019ll come down tomorrow and blah, blah, blah.\u201d They left. I remember thinking, \u201cYou can fucking do that? I didn\u2019t know you could do that.\u201d So, she was, of course, vilified. The next day in the paper, they had this picture of her and she was talking to the media. She had her hand like that. It\u2019s like, you fucking backed over 11 people! I\u2019ll go with you that can happen that you can\u2019t see them, but you left. You fucking left. Yeah, get the fuck out of here. I notice that. You start picking up on that. I remember one time this comic did some passive-aggressive shit I called him out on and he immediately went with the two hands to the chest. I\u2019m like, that\u2019s the kind of guy that would back over 11 people and drive away. I wouldn\u2019t have noticed that if I didn\u2019t go to therapy. I\u2019ve also noticed I talk to myself a lot. Getting into it with people and screaming and yelling. Then I\u2019ll drive away and be like, all right, Bill, how did that go? Then try to see if I was wrong in it. They were right, you know? That\u2019s somebody\u2019s mom. You just yelled at her. What\u2019s wrong with you? I really had kind of a hair-trigger kind of thing. It\u2019s something that working on my temper, I\u2019ve really been, especially lately because I was making my wife on pins and needles because it wasn\u2019t like I was flipping out over anything. I fucking hate these things. Whatever this is. The second it came out and I saw this. Whatever this is, this pad. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, iPad? Bill Burr: I hate these things. I can\u2019t stand them. They don\u2019t make my life easier. They\u2019re a nightmare. They\u2019re intrusive. I can\u2019t stand them. So I flip out about them. I saw a thing recently, this politically active comedian was sitting there talking and trying to get people to vote in this oddly bullying way. Going like, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an app out there that\u2019s going to say whether you voted or not. They\u2019re not going to know who you voted for, but they\u2019re going to know that you voted. So you can\u2019t basically bullshit people anymore.\u201d I just was watching it the whole time going, and like that\u2019s a good thing? That level of private information, because of this fucking app? I didn\u2019t say whether you could say whether I voted or not. That\u2019s what I hate about all of this shit. I have a theory. Somewhere around \u201994, \u201995, we should\u2019ve stopped making new shit. They cured enough diseases. Cars were fast enough. Planes aren\u2019t really any faster than they were back then. It was good. But all of this shit now. Tim Ferriss: Tape your cameras. Bill Burr: Yeah. All of this stuff. Look at Billy Bush. Billy Bush got fired for some shit that happened in 2005. It\u2019s fucking unbelievable. All he was doing is what an interviewer does. He was keeping the interviewee happy. Right? The guy was like, \u201cI just grab their pussies.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, yeah, grab some pussy. Whatever. We doing this?\u201d For all you know, at the end of the interview when Trump left, he could\u2019ve been like, \u201cWhat was that guy like?\u201d \u201cThat guy was out of his mind. He was talking about grabbing pussies. He\u2019s fucking crazy.\u201d Anyway, who do we got next? Matthew McConaughey. \u201cAll right, all right, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He\u2019s just doing that. For all you know, that\u2019s all he was doing. That\u2019s what I hate about this shit. You literally take two seconds of somebody\u2019s life and you\u2019re like, that\u2019s who you are. That Tweet is who you are. That\u2019s what\u2019s in your heart and all of this shit. I got friends of mine that\u2019ve gotten big shows, SNL and stuff like that. One person, they had to go back to 2010. They went through six years of Tweets to try and \u2013 \u201cWell, what was about this one?\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s like, get the fuck out of here, right? Tim Ferriss: Why did you start doing the podcast? Bill Burr: I guess \u2013 Bobby Kelly. Once again, I was hanging at his apartment when we used to live near each other in New York. He was just like, \u201cDude, you\u2019ve got to do this. It\u2019s called a podcast.\u201d I had no idea what it was. He kept saying, \u201cIt\u2019s another way to connect with your fans.\u201d Both me and him and all of my friends, we weren\u2019t the guys they were picking. We just weren\u2019t the guys. Whatever they were going for, we just never were the guys. Yet, on every showcase, they\u2019d always put us on last because we were really good at what we did, but there was always whatever the hell it was they were looking for, we were the outcasts. So any way to connect with your fans, we had to do it. That was this new thing. I just liked doing it. At first, I used to call in. Before I had the mixer and all that, I used to call in to this service. So I would just call up this phone number on my flip-phone. I would be in airports and I would just be trashing people and telling stories and singing songs. At first, I just did it for seven minutes. Then it was ten minutes, then it be came 20, then a half hour. Then I started going, ask me some questions. I had this thing, underrated/overrated, for a while. YouTube video of the week. I built a show around it and it became what it became. Tim Ferriss: Was it for shits and giggles or was there something behind it? Bill Burr: No, I wanted to connect with fans. It was just another thing to do. But it was also that I enjoyed it. Because there\u2019s other ways to connect with fans that I don\u2019t enjoy. Like all those things when you upload your pictures? I don\u2019t like those because it says, can we have access to all your photos? No, you can have access to this photo, you fucking weirdo. So I don\u2019t do it. I just don\u2019t do any of those. But then there\u2019s other stuff. It\u2019s the say thing. It\u2019s like the mall thing again. Does this fit into the wheelhouse of what I feel like I want to do? It\u2019s just something I like doing. So I just started doing it. Tim Ferriss: During the period of your specials and then getting all the way to F is for Family, what were the high points for you? Bill Burr: I didn\u2019t hear the question. I just heard that person groaning out there, like, ugh. Sorry, we\u2019re getting down to the end here. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a C-minus question. Bear with me. I\u2019m working on my material. Bill Burr: I think his ass is hurting from sitting down. This is the beauty. We can go around. Tim Ferriss: From the point that you started doing your specials up to F is for Family, were there any particular inflection points or experiences that set you on the path that led you to where you are? Formative experiences, the Chapelle Show, Breaking Bad. You have so much that you\u2019ve done. I\u2019m just wondering if any stand out. Bill Burr: Influenced my comedy or just got me to where I\u2019m at? Tim Ferriss: Both, either. Bill Burr: All right. Well, getting to me where I\u2019m at is how long it took me to make it is a bunch of people. It\u2019s comics that I saw when I was in Boston. People who gave me shots getting in at The Comic Strip. There was a woman, Amanda Schatz at MTV. She saw me in Boston and then she was like, \u201cI want to see you in New York.\u201d I couldn\u2019t get in at The Comic Strip. I remember Lucien going, \u201cI already have enough white guys.\u201d Blah, blah, blah. I remember all these white guys used to get mad about it. \u201cThis is like reverse racism,\u201d and they want to say all this type of shit. It\u2019s just like, dude, you know what he\u2019s saying. We\u2019re not even a dime a dozen. We\u2019re a dime for 60 of us. If you\u2019re going to be another asshole coming in here talking about your cul-de-sac life, he already has that. Stop being a baby about it, right? Everything else is gravy for you as a white dude. I just basically was like, I remember thinking, all right. I\u2019m going to get in here. I don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019m going to get in here. She saw me and she hooked me up with a showcase there. Somehow I did well and I got past there, which led me to get into New York. Through New York, just being there, I remember Dave Chapelle said some nice things to me one night. He said\u00a0 basically that you\u2019re going to get there, but the road that you\u2019re going is going to take longer. But when you get there, you\u2019re going to have that staying thing. I held onto that for years. When I would be playing some shithole, thinking, but Dave Chapelle said. But then it would just \u2013 a lot of radio guys. Jim Norton getting me in with Opie and Anthony was huge. Randy Baumann in Pittsburgh. I would go to these markets and the guys that I really vibed with, they would give me the option of rather than flying in Thursday morning for your Thursday through Sunday, if you want to fly in Wednesday or Tuesday and just do radio the whole week, I\u2019ll help you pack the place. Guys like Randy Baumann in Pittsburgh and I would do that. I would just come in, have no shows Tuesday, Wednesday, and I would just do four hours of radio in the morning. Do the whole morning show and then do morning on Thursday and Friday, just killing it as hard as I could to get it half-full, maybe they don\u2019t have to pull the curtain. It was just all those types of things. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been doing this shit for a long time. Breaking Bad was huge. Because forever, I wanted to play a guy like that. But back when I had my hair and stuff, I looked like Ron Howard. I was always the friend. I was the nerd. I just wasn\u2019t going to be that guy. I just always wanted to play a guy like Kubey and they gave me a shot. Then through that, all of a sudden I got these other roles. Once you get it on tape and they see that you can do it, then like oh, he can do this. Then people will take a shot on you. That was a huge thing. I\u2019d say Mike Binder when I did Black or White, which became Black and White. What was it? It was Black and White was the original name of it, but somebody already owned the copyright of that and they wouldn\u2019t sell it. So then we had to switch it to Black or White. It was this trial about who would have the rights to watch this kid that was racially mixed, who was half-white and half-black. So Black and White made it seem inclusive, but we had to switch it to Black or White, so it became this make-a-decision vibe to it. But I got to play a lawyer in that and had all these great, dramatic scenes and all that. I got a nice acting thing going on where I get to do some drama stuff, I get to do some comedy stuff, so it\u2019s been cool. Tim Ferriss: Speaking of Cosmo magazine, this next question is from Marcus Harbaugh I think is how you say it, also from Facebook. \u201cMy wife thinks he\u2019s hilarious and she\u2019s generally not a fan of pro-male-types of comedy. How did he learn to so expertly deliver that kind of humor without alienating his female audience?\u201d Bill Burr: I alienate a lot of females. I do. I alienate issue people. I alienate politically correct people. They\u2019ve got that thing like, this is the issue. You\u2019re only allowed to have this thought on this issue. I have zero sense of humor about this issue. These are all the proper words. If you use these words, you\u2019re this. It\u2019s hilarious because they\u2019re progressive left, using the exact same Fox News extreme right. They\u2019re the exact same fucking lunatics. I hate progressive left people, generally speaking. And the Fox News to the right. \u201cThey\u2019re taking our country!\u201d Those people. I can\u2019t even listen to them. They\u2019re idiots. Both of them their heart is in the right place. They\u2019re doing it in this very Stalin-esque kind of way of zero tolerance. What\u2019s funny to me is the right always gets that. The left just cannot see when they\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s like, you\u2019ve become what the fuck you\u2019re fighting. You\u2019re annoying. I think that explains a little bit of the Trump shit. Like how that guy came up. You guys were ramming this shit down. It\u2019s so fucked up. If you just look at politics. Obama was a response to eight years of the Bush people ramming it down your throad. He was a response to eight years of Clinton people ramming it down their throats and then 12 years before that, you had Reagan and Bush. Both sides just can\u2019t present their shit. They\u2019ve got to be like, \u201cFucking eat it! Eat it!\u201d You know? All it does is it causes resentment. If you look, the pendulum just keeps swinging further and further. Right now, people sound crazy to me on either side. I can\u2019t watch it. If anybody in the left gets in, it\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be socialism!\u201d \u201cThis is going to be like communist Russia!\u201d If anybody right gets in it, it\u2019s like, \u201cThis is like Germany in 1935!\u201d Every fucking time. Just going like this. I don\u2019t know. I just try to be like, all right, let\u2019s settle down. Everybody fucking relax. Get yourself a sandwich. Some of these things could be true. Some of them might not be true, but getting into this, \u201cAh! Ah!\u201d you\u2019re not going to be able to make the right move when you have to. We\u2019ll see. Tim Ferriss: Do you deliberately, at times, try to lose the audience? Like push them to the breaking point and then reel them back? Is that sort of a sport for you? Bill Burr: What I used to do, that was from playing hell rooms and no one would listen. What I would do is I would make a statement that would make people be like, \u201cDude, what the fuck?\u201d Thinking that I\u2019m heading towards this thing, right? Like I would make a statement that would make you feel like I\u2019m heading towards supporting the Clan or beating women or anything like that. You just say that and that gets everybody to drop their fork to listen. Like, \u201cDude? What the fuck is this?\u201d Then you just wind them back to the point that you wanted to make anyway and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, all right. Okay. That\u2019s kind of funny.\u201d Then you just keep doing that. Eventually, once I had the room, then I could just do my show. I think a little bit of that has started to bleed into my style. I don\u2019t do that anymore on purpose. But when I was coming up, I used to do that on purpose. There were all these techniques. You could also start talking quieter if people were talking louder. People used to say that. That never fucking worked for me. Nobody heard me. I\u2019m like, okay, nobody\u2019s listening to my jokes. But a lot of that came from all those crazy rooms. I\u2019m very proud that I did all those and I didn\u2019t sidestep any of those. I pretty much did all of them. I did the good rooms, the bad rooms, the white rooms, black rooms, gay clubs. I did everything because I really felt that \u2013 I know why. I know why. I just remembered this. When I was a kid, not a kid, I was probably 18 years old and it was the summer of \u201986 and Rodney Dangerfield, the late, great Rodney Dangerfield, was on tour and he came to this place Great Woods. Now it\u2019s called the Tweeter Center. I remember he came and he killed and he was hilarious and all that. I saw all these people there, blah, blah, blah. I didn\u2019t notice that they were all white because I was white. I was just like wow, we\u2019re all watching this guy, whatever. Then a month later, I saw Eddie Murphy on the Raw tour. He had the blue leather suit. I had lawn seats. That\u2019s how famous this dude was. I was sitting on the grass watching a guy doing stand-up comedy. He had the Weather Girls open up for him and everything. I remember that night looking around going, wait, this guy\u2019s making everybody laugh. This is the difference. I remembered getting into comedy that I didn\u2019t want to be that guy being a radio station. He makes white males, 18 to 35, you know. I wanted to be like this guy is funny, but the only way to do that was to do all of those different rooms. It didn\u2019t always go well. Black rooms are hilarious. What I learned about them is they\u2019re either going to have fun with you or without you. But either way, they\u2019re going to have a good time. Those were some of my favorite shows that I ever did. There was a legendary show at this now-gone comedy club that\u2019s now like a fucking wine bar, which just kills me because it was just the rawest, sickest, in the Village. It was right as Giuliani was taking over, so people were still selling drugs out in front. It was crazy. I used to see all these guys. Like young Dave Chapelle, Jay Moore, Red Johnny and the Round Guy, all these guys just murdering in there. But Sunday night was the uptown show. Because they wouldn\u2019t say the \u201cblack only\u201d show. They would say \u201cthe uptown show.\u201d This guy, Talent and Will Silvents used to host that show. For me, that was the show. To this day, that was the most fun show I ever did was. When you killed on that show, dude, it was like \u2013 you walked out of that like why am I not famous yet? That\u2019s how hard. It was just everyone was on top of you. It was the greatest ever. But when you bombed, it was like, why did I ever think I was funny? I should\u2019ve opened a hardware store. You would just leave like dejected. Those were some rough nights though. Going back to the technically one-bedroom that was really a studio and getting under the futon just laying there. A lot of grunting and groaning the next day in the shower. Like, ugh, God, I hate myself! Tim Ferriss: What piece of advice would you give your 25-year-old self? Bill Burr: I hate that question. You always say that. If you could go back and tell yourself what you don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: What did you dislike about your 25-year-old self? If you prefer that question. Bill Burr: What did I dislike? No, I definitely felt like a freak back then. I definitely did not feel \u2013 I never felt like I fit in anywhere until I went to a comedy club. Just seeing all the comics. These people are the same kind of crazy that I am. You know what I mean? Like everybody\u2019s out of their mind. But there was a specific way that they were nuts that I would just meet them. I was like, I know this person but I don\u2019t know them. It just felt like in a weird way like you were going home. It was crazy. But as far as what I would tell myself? I would be afraid to fuck it up because it ended up so well. It\u2019s like Back to the Future, whatever the hell it\u2019s called. I always mess up the name of movies. Back to the Future, where you change one thing, you know? Seeing how your Mom wants to fuck you or however that happened. Wasn\u2019t that one of the storylines? Tim Ferriss: Calvin, look at me, Calvin. Bill Burr: That feel-good, family movie. The Mom wants to bang her son from the future. Oh, it was great for the kids. It was wonderful. Oh, the \u201880s. Tim Ferriss: How old are you now? Bill Burr: 48. Tim Ferriss: What do you think your 60-year-old self would tell your current self? Bill Burr: Buy some apartment buildings. Tim Ferriss: Buy some apartment buildings? Bill Burr: Yes. Because I want to do stuff like that. Because when I\u2019m 70, I want to leave, if I want to, I probably won\u2019t because I love doing it so much, but I don\u2019t want to be that guy in that mustard-stained tuxedo suit just still \u2013 he knows the numbers start going down the back 9. I\u2019m like, \u201cI have things to say.\u201d People going like, \u201cOh, I saw him in front of three people. It was a sad. There was a donut-making machine in the back.\u201d I go back to those gigs. So I would like to not go out. I\u2019m doing real well. I\u2019m making great money. I would like to not go out and buy a bunch of dumb, shiny shit. I would like to buy shit like assets so I have money. My next goal, the same way I did the thing where I never got sucked so far into this business where I had to apologize even if I wasn\u2019t sorry. I now want to get the money that I\u2019m making in this business to make money outside of the business. Eventually, this business is done with you. It just is. You have to deal with that shit. I would just love to be \u2013 to be honest with you, man, if I could just make a decent amount of money off of shit like that. Yeah, I just always picture myself sitting on the back porch with a dog, not giving a shit, smoking a cigar. That\u2019s how I want to \u2013 I would still do stuff. Tim Ferriss: What kind of cigar? Bill Burr: They don\u2019t mess them up with global warming. If you can still make a great one, it\u2019d definitely be a Cuban. Probably a Robusto. The Cohibas I like. I like the Partagas. I just smoked one recently. I don\u2019t even know the name of it. It was one of the sickest cigars I\u2019ve ever smoked. It was like a two-hour smoke. I absolutely love cigars. But there is a thing amogst cigar smokers where if someone comes nosing around. If you bust out a box of cigars at a party, all these fucking phonies will come up. Oh, you smoke cigars? Oh yeah, I smoke cigars. You\u2019ll learn this one time. You\u2019ll give out your cigars to them and then what kills you is you\u2019ll look over like a half hour later and the thing\u2019s halfway smoked and they already ashed the thing out. Just snubbed the thing out. I learned that. So Bobby Kelly \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t out him here. I shouldn\u2019t have said his name. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s all right. [Inaudible] He has two humidors. He\u2019s got the real shit and then he\u2019s got his bullshit. So if somebody comes over, he\u2019ll be like, \u201cYeah, you like cigars? What kind do you like?\u201d If they\u2019re just saying bullshit, \u201cOh I got one for you. I got one I won at a carnival. Here you go.\u201d The guy will go, \u201cOh, this is great! Delicious!\u201d But I really like it. Smoking a cigar is a sacred thing to me. If I have a great cigar, if there\u2019s no place to smoke, I will not smoke it. I\u2019m not going to be this asshole. A couple of my friends are animals. They\u2019ll stand next to a dumpster. Cigarette smokers are animals. They\u2019re like, they\u2019re on the shit, right? So they\u2019ll be in an alley, they don\u2019t care. Fucking rat running by. They\u2019re out there smoking, catching pneuomonia. They\u2019re animals. Cigar smoking is a gentleman\u2019s thing. It\u2019s really an adult thing. It\u2019s just like, I want to be with people that I love, telling stories, hanging out and the right everything. Even if you\u2019re doing it by yourself, you have to have \u2013 I\u2019m never doing this \u2013 can I smoke it before blah, blah, blah? I would just want to have nothing. I just sit there and that great guy thing that my wife cannot understand. Just being able to be a guy and not thinking about shit. Just be sitting there, enjoying yourself. Tim Ferriss: Next question is from Sharpie Sharp. I would like to see that birth certificate. This is from Facebook. What\u2019s the best heckle that\u2019s been thrown your way or most memorable? Bill Burr: There\u2019s too many, man. All right. Black room \u2013 best one I ever got. I was bombing at this place that used to be called Mixed Nuts. It\u2019s now called The Comedy Union. I was up there, dude, when I tell you five minutes of straight silence, dry mouth, nothing. It was the summertime, when sound carries, right? I\u2019m just going and going. It\u2019s nothing and nothing. In the middle of one of my jokes, I\u2019m meandering in this long setup for something else that\u2019s going to bomb, this big, black lady in the back just out loud to nobody, just sort of looked around and went, \u201cI ain\u2019t laughed yet.\u201d The whole place exploded laughing. I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. I didn\u2019t know I had to address it. I kept trying to do my material. Then they were just laughing at me trying to do my \u2013 it was fucking humiliating. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll tell you the weirdest one I got. I\u2019ve told this one before. One of the weirdest ones I got, I was at Dangerfield\u2019s doing the midnight show. It was just one of those nights everybody was bombing. The place was packed and nobody was laughing. I remember the guy in front of me was just bombing so bad. He was on some show where he played a bartender and he had gotten beated up. He was like, \u201cOh yeah, you guys see that movie? You guys see this movie?\u201d Blah, blah, blah. \u201cYeah, I played the bartender. The star of the movie beat the shit out of me. You guys see that?\u201d Then some kid in the back goes, \u201cHe should\u2019ve killed you.\u201d That guy walked past me and never even looked at me. When he got off stage, he just had this flop sweat and just walked by me going, wow, wow. Then I went on stage immediately bombing. There was this group of kids in the corner, these white dudes. They were just ready for a fight. They were super, fucking, hostile. That whole, \u201cMy dad used to beat the shit out of me\u201d vibe? Everything I had learned up to that point was like, Bill, don\u2019t get into it with them. I heard them talking and I was just like, don\u2019t say anything. Don\u2019t say anything. Then finally, this fucking thing when you\u2019re on stage as a comic, you think this and this is some sort of a fucking gun and bullets, but it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just plastic shit. I finally said, \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on over there?\u201d \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d I can\u2019t remember what they said. This guy finally just yelled out, \u201cAnything red and on stage is a faggot.\u201d Right? It was the most childish heckle I ever got. This is back when people didn\u2019t freak out about that word. You guys are like, \u201cOh, my God. What does that say about gay people?\u201d This was when straight people used it. It just meant you were an asshole. So he said that. I just remembered I didn\u2019t know what to do. It was so fucking childish. But I also knew he was going to beat the shit out of me, so I just went right back into my act. This is almost like a cooties joke. You know? This right here, the reaction to that is why you can never leave the comedy clubs, by the way. Because that used to be a funny story, but now because gay people said what that words makes us feel like, even if you say that somebody else said it to you, it becomes this weird thing of like, well does he advocate what he said? It just becomes all of that. It becomes context and all of that shit. That\u2019s what he said. Tim Ferriss: I just have a handful more questions. You mentioned helicopter parents. Helicopters. Bill Burr: Helicopters, yes. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s talk about helicopters. Bill Burr: All right. Tim Ferriss: How and why did you get into helilcopters? Bill Burr: God, you\u2019re just running the gamut of everything here. Helicopters? How\u2019d I get into that? Paranoia of living in California. Living in the L.A. basin. Enough conspiracy theory about nothing behind the dollar. Robots coming and all that type of shit. This place became really claustrophobic. I was like, how the hell would I ever get out of here? When the shit hits the fan, how do you get out of here? Even when it\u2019s working well, it still takes three hours just to get out of here. Forget about some Armageddon shit. I would start up and out. That\u2019s the way to go. Learn how to fly a helicopter. When the zombies come, you just start it up. You just fly out. By the way, that does not work. If you ever see that in the movies where you just start the thing up and you fly out like that. You can do that, but you\u2019re going to fuck it up. You\u2019ve got to let the \u2013 they\u2019ve got belts and stuff. You\u2019ve got to let those things stretch. You\u2019ve got to let the engine heat up and all that. Anytime you see Rambo and those guys just jumping in like it\u2019s a Camaro. Tim Ferriss: Jump in cold and just take off. Bill Burr: If zombie were coming, I would definitely do that shit, but I\u2019d be going, please don\u2019t let the belts snap. Then you just nose it down into one of those fucks, take one with you. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m just imagining the visual. Just like a lawnmower taking out zombies. Do you have other preparations? This is spoken [inaudible]. People think this is crazy. In San Francisco and then in New York, I got really into it and went off the deep end with prepping stuff. I got really into it. Like going to canneries for LDS. You guys can look it up. You can really go down the rabbit hole. Some of you will spin out and get tied up in a straitjacket. I was being lectured at how unreasonable it was and how silly it was that I was getting water and gathering food and all this stuff just in case we had a disaster that took us off the grid for seven days or more in S.F., which happens fairly regularly. Some editors were making fun of me because I was writing at the time. Then Hurricane Sandy hit New York and lo and behold, nobody was prepared, right? Besides the helicopter, do you have other preparations? Bill Burr: No. Tim Ferriss: No? Bill Burr: I don\u2019t own a helicopter either, so it\u2019s pretty fucking useless. No, what it was, was that I went down that rabbit hole. You\u2019ve got to get gold coins and you\u2019ve got to get this powdered food and all that type of stuff. Then somewhere along the line, I was like, do I really want to survive this? Do I really want to see what\u2019s next or do I want to be one of the people that dies? I realized, no, I want to be one of the people that dies. JFK said it. The living will envy the dead. It\u2019s true. I don\u2019t want to start over again in some whole new society. I used to do a bit on that. Somebody just picking up a rake like, these are the new rules! And you\u2019re just all gathering around with your burlap shirt with the string tied around it. I know. I remember when that fat dude who\u2019s running North Korea? The boss\u2019s son? He was trying way too hard to show that he\u2019s a bad ass. Saying he had missiles aimed at L.A. and everyone was panicking. I was like, perfect, man. I hope it\u2019s right at my house. Right at my house and I hope I\u2019m watching the UFC or football Sunday, just sitting there [sings jingle], then all of a sudden, whoosh, just vaporized. Who you don\u2019t want to be is the people up in Bakersfield, just outside of it. You still get the radiation with the boils and shit and your teeth are falling out. Fuck that. Trying to figure out how to catch squirrels. I have no desire to do any of that. Tim Ferriss: Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Burr. Bill Burr: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks for having me on, man. Tim Ferriss: Thanks very much. Bill Burr: I had a great time. Thank you.

an 8-year-old and get on a drum kit and i\u2019d be like, \u201cdude, i\u2019d pay you to take lessons.\u201d i just didn\u2019t have it", "it\u2019s a hobby", "it\u2019s something i enjoy doing, but i would never subject anybody to it on a professional level", "this happens to me a lot with my add", "i went down that road and now i forgot the question", "the question was \u2013 which is fine by the way \u2013 the question was how did you get back on the horse", "what did you say to yourself before getting back onstage", "well, it never dawned on me not to do it again", "had you already committed to the next gig", "it\u2019s weird because all the other social shit the mortified me, i just stayed away from it", "but that thing \u2013 i don\u2019t think i had \u2013 maybe i just was like \u2013 you know it\u2019s going to happen", "it\u2019s like riding a motorcycle", "you know one of these days, you\u2019re going to go down", "you just hope you\u2019re going to live", "you talked about some dark periods earlier", "i\u2019m forgetting the exact timeline", "but what precipitated that", "you said it was a couple of years", "for people who don\u2019t know, i almost offed myself during a year off from college", "i\u2019ve had some battles myself", "how were you going to do it", "you know what", "this is a good question", "i\u2019ll tell you why i\u2019m not going to give an answer because it was a really good plan", "it was a plan that would minimize guilt or self-blaming on the part of my family", "it was really well thought through", "i had everything speced out", "zipline in the woods into a \u2013 yeah, involved some porcupines, a little bit of curare, yeah", "it was very complex", "hard to replicate", "but yeah, i wouldn\u2019t want people to copycat it", "if i put it out there", "but what precipitated that period for you", "what does that mean", "what came before that", "what triggered it", "it\u2019s all right", "using weatherman language, my bad", "i don\u2019t know why", "it just comes out of me sometimes", "yeah, what led to it", "what triggered going into that", "half of you laughing didn\u2019t know what it meant either", "i was just going full speed towards a wall", "i thought i was normal, well-adjusted", "even though i knew i had a crazy temper, i had this period where i would be what you needed me to be", "i was friends with everybody, which is not a real thing if you\u2019re being who you are", "i would adjust my shit so i wouldn\u2019t cause any friction, so there wouldn\u2019t be \u2013 the shit i dealt with coming up", "i had enough of people screaming and yelling", "i had enough of fighting and all that stuff, that i would just adjust my behavior so then we would just be smooth", "i just think using that as a gameplan, eventually, you\u2019re so going to spin away from who the hell you are, that i think that \u2013 and also just focusing on [inaudible] [00:21:25] areas of my life, i think that\u2019s when the anger and all of that stuff started to come up", "then i went like this completely different person", "i really started snapping about nothing for a good 12 years", "somewhere in there \u2013 maybe i was always depressed but i didn\u2019t realize it", "i think i just didn\u2019t realize it", "somewhere along the line, one of the umpteen thousand poor women that ever came across me, one of them finally told me to go to therapy", "i went there thinking i\u2019m fine", "then you start telling stories and it was all this shit that i knew happened but was just hovering", "it\u2019s over here going around in life then all of a sudden when you start talking about it, you say it out loud, it\u2019s like, oh, that\u2019s a real thing", "that really did happen to me", "then you start thinking, wow, i\u2019m pretty fucked up", "and i\u2019m not happy", "i\u2019m really not happy", "i really started getting conscious of what my brain was telling me", "if my brain was a friend, i\u2019d be like, yeah, dude, we can\u2019t do this anymore", "you\u2019re bumming me out", "jesus christ, do you ever see the light", "what the fuck", "you know", "fortunately, i wasn\u2019t clinically, so i didn\u2019t need any medicine", "all i just became aware of it", "then i\u2019d be like, all right, well, there\u2019s that thought", "do you want to have that thought or do you want to go to the gym", "i got back into playing drums, which was a great thing", "i just stopped giving a shit about making it in a way", "i was just like, you know what", "forget this", "i\u2019m just going to do what i do", "because i went through that whole period like \u2013 i know how many of you guys try to make it out where", "you just go through that period where you\u2019re just like, oh, they like guys with blue button-down shirts and you\u2019re wearing the blue button-down shirts", "people who talk about this \u2013 like in my time, it\u2019s gone from the tail-end of the sportcoat guy into the grunge guy, into the alternative scene, into the whole whatever that period was where guys in their 30s acted like they were 14 and they were awkward", "you know, the hoodie", "my wife called them \u2013 not baby men", "man-boys", "man-boys are what she called them", "no, no, i\u2019m just awkward", "like that was this default thing", "great, now i have to hold up both ends of the conversation", "those people i kind of got hostile with", "i was just like, well, when you get over that and you can fucking talk to me, yeah, you are awkward", "this is weird", "i also thought a lot of people that do that, it\u2019s also a passive-aggressive thing to come in and fucking steal focus and we all have to deal with how awkward you are and make sure you\u2019re okay", "it\u2019s like, fuck you, dude", "you\u2019re in your 30s", "figure this out", "i\u2019ll never forget one time, i was in a green room in new york", "i was living in l.a", "i met an old friend and we were talking

in the tail-end of the stories", "we\u2019re having this great time", "then this woman comes in, a comedian", "she was socially awkward", "she didn\u2019t know how to get into it", "so we\u2019re all laughing and everything", "she walked right into the middle of the circle", "i swear to god, she just walked in going like, \u201chello, hello, hello, hello.\u201d she was mocking saying hello", "but then totally stole all the focus", "everyone was just like, whoa, you all right", "all the fun went out of the room", "then everyone was dealing with her", "then she left", "i said to my friend, \u201cwhat the fuck was that?\u201d that was some rude shit", "we were having a great time", "if you don\u2019t know how to say fucking hello, learn how to do it", "don\u2019t come in and take the whole thing away and ruin this thing", "that was the last time", "i was like, fuck these awkward people", "if you\u2019re really \u2013 i don\u2019t want to bully somebody if they really are socially awkward or something like that", "i\u2019ll work with you", "but if you just embraced, i\u2019m awkward now the world has to deal with it", "right, if that\u2019s your schtick", "yeah, go fuck yourself", "we also have a clip that we\u2019ll pull up in a minute from f is for family that might \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "now that i\u2019ve seen all the episodes and now that you\u2019re telling me a lot of these stories, i can see where i think a lot of them came from", "there\u2019s one clip we\u2019ll pull up in a little bit", "i\u2019m not going to do it just right now", "what have you found to help get you out of a depressed period", "you mentioned exercise", "for instance, i\u2019ve found drummers, in general, to be very happy people", "i don\u2019t know if they\u2019re happy and then they end up drumming or if it\u2019s because of the physical aspect of just going animal on a drum kid", "it\u2019s awesome", "it\u2019s a great feeling", "it\u2019s awesome", "i also had played the drums in college, but i was not very good at all", "but that was my experience", "it alleviated a lot of these darker thoughts", "yeah, it\u2019s fun", "is there anything else that you\u2019ve found particularly helpful", "yeah, i just do shit", "i just get up and do something that day", "i like to cook and stuff, so i\u2019ll go on youtube", "what i did recently \u2013 who\u2019s the guy from hell\u2019s kitchen", "gordon ramsay", "yeah, gordon ramsay", "dude, he\u2019s got this video", "like the sickest scrambled egg you\u2019re ever going to make in your life", "it\u2019s insane", "i just remember watching it and i was just like, i\u2019m going to fucking make that thing", "because i have the free time", "as a comedian, i could do it", "i went out and bought all the ingredients and all that type of stuff", "that\u2019s what i do", "or i\u2019ll learn something", "i do have my hobbies like cooking and playing drums and a few other things that i do", "i try to have that moment in the day to learn something or go somewhere", "working out is a big thing, that\u2019s a big thing", "how did your goals change, if they did, from when you\u2019re trying to force fit yourself", "what was the pinnacle that you had in mind for making it to after", "for me coming up, it was all about having an hbo special", "because hbo specials, those were the best comics", "that\u2019s all the great guys that i saw coming up", "you got on hbo\u2019s totally uncensored and they were the home for that", "unfortunately, when i got into it, right in the early \u201890s, by the mid-\u201890s, they just stopped doing it for like ten years", "that\u2019s when i felt rudderless because when hbo stopped doing their specials, i didn\u2019t know what to do", "what comedy central started going the half-hours, the fact that they had commercials", "i think it\u2019s eight minutes each hour", "so they were automatically going to take eight minutes out of a half hour", "then they would beep out the curses with the worst, most archaic [beep, beep]", "and they wouldn\u2019t just fade it down and come back up", "so i remember watching specials and thinking that was really distracting", "so once again, i worked clean", "if you watch my first half hour on comedy central, i worked totally clean", "i gave them the least amount of material that i could", "because it was guys going like, all right, here\u2019s a half hour, they\u2019re only going to use 22 minutes", "what they would do is they\u2019d do 40", "so then you had this guy who you didn\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t approve of, is now going to hack 40 minutes down to 22", "what is he going to do", "exactly", "so i was like, fuck that", "what\u2019s the least you can do", "they said the least amount of time you can do is like 25 or 26", "i did exactly that", "so the worst you could do was butcher four of it out, but the rest of it was going to look good, so i was happy with it", "it was just kind of doing stuff like that", "but it still wasn\u2019t what i wanted because it wasn\u2019t me", "that half hour that i did, that was me doing an extended letterman spot where i was working totally clean", "it wasn\u2019t until hbo came back and did the half hours and i did those that i actually got to do \u2013 it was the first time people got to see me not in a club", "they were at home and they got to see that this is what i do", "that was the same time i got on the opie and anthony show and they all kind of came out at the same time", "it was the first time i went to a club and it was sold out and people were there to see me, which was a whole other level of pressure", "up until then, it was people coming to the club because that\u2019s what they did; they had nothing else to do", "like eh, let\u2019s go down to the comedy club and you had to prove to them that you were funny", "i used to remember thinking, imagine if they came to see me how much easier this would be", "i didn\u2019t realize the other pressure was like, no we saw that, so we\u2019re expecting at least that if not better", "then it\u2019s like, oh, man", "that took me a good three months", "it was a new kind of nervous experience to get over of people expecting", "we\u2019re here to see you", "we like what you do", "don\u2019t ruin this", "what was the first special", "the first half hour: yeah", "not the comedy central, but the first time you could be yourself", "that was the hbo half hour that i did", "that was in 2005", "2005", "i still remember", "april 2005 and came out in sp is there anything since then \u2013 and this is an assumption on my part, which is dangerous, but did you feel like you had summited the mountain at that point", "did you feel like you\u2019d arrived", "no", "i felt that somewhere in like 2009, 2010", "by then, i\u2019d done a couple of hours", "i\u2019d done my second hour for netflix, which became the new hbo, as far as just totally uncensored", "i think i bought a house at that point", "i bought a house", "i had a niche following", "i was saying to my wife, \u201ci know you\u2019re not supposed to say this, but i made it.\u201d because there\u2019s a sickness in this business of like, \u201cno, man", "if you think you made it, then you\u2019re going to relax and it\u2019s all going to go away.\u201d so i\u2019m never going to be happy", "i tell dick jokes and i just bought a house", "i made it", "i didn\u2019t want to be that guy that is doing well and is like, oh, what about the next thing", "that sickness", "the greyhound chasing the rabbit", "yeah", "performance or driven people can have this sickness of it\u2019s just like you can\u2019t even enjoy it", "it\u2019s like, what\u2019s the next thing", "i know guys that accomplish something", "as they\u2019re getting right to the peak, this depression hits them because they\u2019re like, \u201cthen what", "what am i going to do when this is over", "then i got nothing.\u201d hey, can you just fucking have a beer up here", "we did this, you know", "can we enjoy this for a second", "did you continue doing therapy after those initial sessions that you mentioned", "i did it for a few years", "then one day it just dawned on that i was just talking in circles", "bad shit is always going to happen to me", "am i just going to keep coming here and moaning about it", "at what point am i going to grow up and not need this", "i\u2019m not trying to say that you\u2019re weak if you go there, but i just hit this point where i was, you know", "all of those shit happened", "it happened, right", "it definitely affected who i am, but now i\u2019m not going to be like lashing out at people", "i\u2019ll be like, oh, i do this because of that \u2013 a little bit of that", "at some point \u2013 like if somebody\u2019s teaching you how to fix a car \u2013 at some point, you\u2019ve got to try to fix it yourself", "you can\u2019t be like, turn right here", "how do i do this", "it just became like that", "now i self-therapy myself", "it\u2019s cheaper", "you mentioned the delusion maybe of always chasing the next thing and never being satisfied with where you are", "the other worry that i\u2019ve heard a lot from friends of mine who are comedians is that if they do therapy or meditation or fill-in-the-blank to tone down some of their tendencies, that it will make them less funny", "is that something you \u2013 i thought that was true", "no, it\u2019s not true", "what it does is it gives you insight into you as a human and then you see people differently", "it actually allowed me to think about characters and just notice shit with people that i never did before", "i got a thing with somebody", "anybody who does this when they\u2019re talking", "like i worship blah, blah, blah", "they\u2019re full of shit", "no", "not only are they full of shit, they have a complete inability to accept responsibility for anything they\u2019ve ever done", "i just recently told this to jim norton", "it was that publicist who backed over those 12 people in long island", "i remember she drove away and then she went to her house", "when she got to her house, the cops showed up and the lawyer met them in the driveway and was like, \u201cyeah, she\u2019ll come down tomorrow and blah, blah, blah.\u201d they left", "i remember thinking, \u201cyou can fucking do that", "i didn\u2019t know you could do that.\u201d so, she was, of course, vilified", "the next day in the paper, they had this picture of her and she was talking to the media", "she had her hand like that", "it\u2019s like, you fucking backed over 11 people", "i\u2019ll go with you that can happen that you can\u2019t see them, but you left", "you fucking left", "yeah, get the fuck out of here", "i notice that", "you start picking up on that", "i remember one time this comic did some passive-aggressive shit i called him out on and he immediately went with the two hands to the chest", "i\u2019m like, that\u2019s the kind of guy that would back over 11 people and drive away", "i wouldn\u2019t have noticed that if i didn\u2019t go to therapy", "i\u2019ve also noticed i talk to myself a lot", "getting into it with people and screaming and yelling", "then i\u2019ll drive away and be like, all right, bill, how did that go", "then try to see if i was wrong in it", "they were right, you know", "that\u2019s somebody\u2019s mom", "you just yelled at her", "what\u2019s wrong with you", "i really had kind of a hair-trigger kind of thing", "it\u2019s something that working on my temper, i\u2019ve really been, especially lately because i was making my wife on pins and needles because it wasn\u2019t like i was flipping out over anything",

don\u2019t make my life easier", "they\u2019re a nightmare", "they\u2019re intrusive", "i can\u2019t stand them", "so i flip out about them", "i saw a thing recently, this politically active comedian was sitting there talking and trying to get people to vote in this oddly bullying way", "going like, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be an app out there that\u2019s going to say whether you voted or not", "they\u2019re not going to know who you voted for, but they\u2019re going to know that you voted", "so you can\u2019t basically bullshit people anymore.\u201d i just was watching it the whole time going, and like that\u2019s a good thing", "that level of private information, because of this fucking app", "i didn\u2019t say whether you could say whether i voted or not", "that\u2019s what i hate about all of this shit", "i have a theory", "somewhere around \u201994, \u201995, we should\u2019ve stopped making new shit", "they cured enough diseases", "cars were fast enough", "planes aren\u2019t

happened in 2005", "it\u2019s fucking unbelievable", "all he was doing is what an interviewer does", "he was keeping the interviewee happy", "right", "the guy was like, \u201ci just grab their pussies.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, yeah, grab some pussy", "whatever", "we doing this?\u201d for all you know, at the end of the interview when trump left, he could\u2019ve been like,

two seconds of somebody\u2019s life and you\u2019re like, that\u2019s who you are", "that tweet is who you are", "that\u2019s what\u2019s in your heart and all of this shit", "i got friends of mine that\u2019ve gotten big shows, snl and stuff like that", "one person, they had to go back to 2010", "they went through six years of tweets to try and \u2013 \u201cwell, what was about this one?\u201d

any way to connect with your fans, we had to do it", "that was this new thing", "i just liked doing it", "at first, i used to call in", "before i had the mixer and all that, i used to call in to this service", "so i would just call up this phone number on my flip-phone", "i would be in airports and i would just be trashing people and telling stories and singing songs", "at first, i just did it for seven minutes", "then it was ten minutes, then it be came 20, then a half hour", "then i started going, ask me some questions", "i had this thing, underrated/overrated, for a while", "youtube video of the week", "i built a show around it and it became what it became", "was it for shits and giggles or was there something behind it", "no, i wanted to connect with fans", "it was just another thing to

not even a dime a dozen", "we\u2019re a dime for 60 of us", "if you\u2019re going to be another asshole coming in here talking about your cul-de-sac life, he already has that", "stop being a baby
