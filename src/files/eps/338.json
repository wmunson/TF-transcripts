Howard Marks: Thank you, Tim. I\u2019ve been looking forward to being here. Tim Ferriss: I am thrilled to be sitting here with you because I have so many fans of your work and thinking in my friend circles. Howard Marks: That\u2019s great to hear. Tim Ferriss: When I went out to a handful to ask for potential topics or questions, they were very forthcoming, but what I thought I would do in this particular episode that I\u2019ve never done in a podcast episode before is to start with a poem. This is always risky business, but this was suggested by a friend. He said, \u201cI would use an A.E. Housman poem.\u201d This effectively captures what he views as the spirit of much of your writing, and you can agree or disagree. Here we go. \u201cI to my perils Of cheat and charmer Came clad in armor By stars benign. Hope lies to mortals And most believe her, But man\u2019s deceiver  Was never mine. The thoughts of others Were light and fleeting, Of lovers\u2019 meeting Or luck or fame. Mine were of trouble, And mine were steady; So I was ready When trouble came.\u201d And the name of that poem is A Shropshire Lad. I thought that we could certainly talk about that specifically, but in the course of doing research for this conversation, I discovered that you had studied not only finance and what you might look at as vocational subjects when you were in undergrad, but it also seems like you studied Japanese, and there was this concept of muj\u014d that popped up when I was doing my reading. Would you mind describing that time and that concept? Howard Marks: Well, I went to Wharton at an enlightened time, when you were required to have a non-business minor and a semester of the literature of a foreign country \u2013 in English. I never learned Japanese, but for some reason, I started off \u2013 it\u2019s interesting that I have no recollection of what motivated me, but I decided against French or English literature in favor of Japanese literature. It must have been the exoticism. I liked it so much that I turned Japanese studies into my minor and took 15 credits at the graduate level. That\u2019s what turned me from an indifferent teenager into a student, really, but the professor for most of those courses \u2013 a guy named E. Dale Saunders \u2013 was an inspirational speaker, an Oxford don, and an aesthete. So I took his course in Japanese philosophy, and we came across muj\u014d. \u201cMuj\u014d\u201d literally means \u201cthe turning of the wheel of the law\u201d \u2013 in other words, the operation of life. The essence is impermanence because the wheel does turn. It also means the unpredictability of the future. These were really formative for me, and they have unconsciously informed everything I\u2019ve done. I personally think that in the investment business \u2013 and also in life \u2013 you are better off if you realize that life is always going to change on you, there will always be new things coming down the pike, and that you can\u2019t control it. What we have to do is live with it. Tim Ferriss: In the course of the reading I\u2019ve done to prep for this, which is not only the new book, but also many of your letters of which I already was a fan but came back to revisit, I came across many people who had tried to select favorite quotes, and one that came up a lot \u2013 you can certainly correct this if it is not accurate \u2013 is something along the lines of, \u201cYou can\u2019t predict. You can prepare.\u201d And that leads me to 2008. I suspect we\u2019re going to bounce around chronologically quite a lot. During the 2008 bubble, which of course was a time in which many investors were pulling out of the market, Oaktree did exactly the opposite. You put more than $500 million a week to work over 15 weeks. Why did you do that? Were you predicting? Were you prepared? What led to that type of decision? Howard Marks: Sure. Well, you mentioned the memos. I\u2019ve been writing the memos since 1990. I wrote one about 20 years ago in the late \u201890s called, \u201cYou can\u2019t predict. You can prepare.\u201d I stole the tagline from an ad for Northwestern Mutual life insurance, but I think that\u2019s true of life. Now, it sounds like an oxymoron because how can you prepare if you can\u2019t predict? But the answer is we never know what\u2019s going to happen, but we can consider the likely scenarios and prepare for some of them. By definition, you can\u2019t prepare for every eventuality. But, I would say that we did have a sense \u2013 my partner Bruce Karsh and I had a sense in \u201905 and \u201906 that the world wasn\u2019t running right, and the main thing that made us conclude that was the crappy deals that were getting done. He and I would spend the day walking into each other\u2019s offices saying, \u201cLook at this piece of crap that got issued yesterday. There\u2019s something wrong. A deal like this should not be doable. The fact that investors are buying this tells me that they\u2019re not being skeptical, they\u2019re not being demanding, they\u2019re not applying standards.\u201d Buffett has a saying: \u201cThe less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own affairs,\u201d and it\u2019s absolutely true. And so we knew that the market was dangerous because of the behavior of others. Now, you can\u2019t \u2013 so we were prepared. We sold a lot of assets, we liquidated large funds, we replaced them with small funds, we became very selective in our buying, and we raised a very large fund for investment if a bursting crisis would come into being. Tim Ferriss: Was this for distressed debt? Howard Marks: Distressed debt. Now, the interesting thing, though \u2013 so you can prepare; you can\u2019t predict. The thing that caused the bubble to burst was the insubstantiality of mortgage-backed securities, especially subprime. If you read the memos, you won\u2019t find a word about it. We didn\u2019t predict that. We didn\u2019t even know about it. It was occurring in an odd corner of the securities market. Most of us didn\u2019t know about it, but it is what brought the house down and we had no idea. But we were prepared because we simply knew that we were on dangerous ground, and that required cautious preparation. Tim Ferriss: Let me ask \u2013 and I may embarrass myself with questions that display my ignorance about many topics in this interview, but when you raised money for a distressed debt fund, did you emphasize to the LPs or whoever gave you those funds that you had a specific timeline in mind for deploying those funds, or did you emphasize the importance of patience with those people, that you\u2019d be looking for indicators, and that they needed to look at it as a long-term investment? How did you manage the question of when from those people? Howard Marks: The question of when is one of the hardest ones in our business, and I always say that we may have an idea of what\u2019s going to happen, but we never know when it\u2019s going to happen. You can\u2019t call these things. As one of my partners says, \u201cIf you name a price, don\u2019t name a date, and if you name a date, don\u2019t name a price, and then you can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d But we never did name a date. We probably \u2013 I can\u2019t even remember \u2013 we probably had a limit. In other words, if we hadn\u2019t deployed it within X years, then the commitment got canceled. But I think there was an understanding that we thought it was coming within the next one to three years. Tim Ferriss: Now, the subtitle of this new book \u2013 of course, the title is Mastering the Market Cycle \u2013 is Getting the Odds on Your Side. How does one \u2013 and of course, this is something we could discuss for many hours on end \u2013 why this book, and in this context, how does someone get the odds on their side? Howard Marks: So I started writing the memos in 1990; I wrote them for 20 years. I always concluded that I would write a book and pull them together into a philosophy when I retired, and then I got a letter from Warren Buffett in 2010 saying, \u201cIf you write a book, I\u2019ll give you a blurb for the jacket.\u201d So that was enough to get me off my ass and get me to do it in real time. I wrote a book called The Most Important Thing because I found myself sitting in clients\u2019 offices saying, \u201cThe most important thing is buying cheap,\u201d and then, 10 minutes later, I would say, \u201cThe most important thing is not losing money,\u201d and then, 10 minutes later, I would say, \u201cThe most important thing is contrarian behavior.\u201d So I wrote a book called The Most Important Thing, which has 21 chapters, and each one starts off with the title \u201cThe Most Important Thing Is\u2026\u201d and then it\u2019s a most important thing. One of those most important things is knowing where we stand in the cycle. As I say, I don\u2019t believe in forecasts. We always say, \u201cWe never know where we\u2019re going, but we sure as hell ought to know where we are.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, but I should be able to assess the current environment, and that\u2019s the kind of thinking that helped us prepare for the crisis. I think that the two most important things are where we stand in the cycle and the broad subject of risk, and in fact, where we stand in the cycle is the primary determinant of risk, so I think that this is a really important topic and it can really help you do better. What Getting the Odds on Your Side means is that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 nobody can tell you \u2013 but there are times when the outlook for the future is better and there are times when it\u2019s worse, and it\u2019s largely determined by where we stand in the cycle. When we are low in the cycle \u2013 that is to say, we\u2019re coming off a bust \u2013 the economy is starting to warm up. Investors are just barely starting to switch from pessimism to optimism and prices are starting to rise. Clearly, the odds are in your favor. The outlook is better. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to make money, but the chances are good. On the other hand, when the upcycle has gone on for a long time, when valuations are high, when optimism is rampant, when everybody thinks everything\u2019s going to get better forever, when the economy has been moving ahead for 10 years and it looks like it\u2019s never going to stop, then usually, the enthusiasm has carried the prices to such a high level that the odds are against you. Just knowing that is a huge advantage in investing. You should know that when we\u2019re low in the upcycle, that\u2019s a time to be aggressive, put a lot of money to work, and buy more aggressive things, and when the cycle has gone on for a long time and we\u2019re elevated, that\u2019s the time to take some money off the table and behave more cautiously. Tim Ferriss: Question about 2008 \u2013 or you could pick another period or bust cycle that you\u2019re familiar with, whether from firsthand experience or research that you\u2019ve done. You raised these funds, and I want to revisit the question of when. From a personal standpoint \u2013 and I\u2019ll admit it very freely \u2013 I think I\u2019ve had a very fear-based mentality when it comes to public markets. I\u2019ve done reasonably well in privately held technology startups because I lived in the middle of the switchbox in San Francisco and that\u2019s the only thing I paid attention to, and it protected me, in a way, from my lesser behaviors because I wasn\u2019t allowed to sell. But in the public markets, I\u2019ve almost always held on to cash, waiting for some cataclysmic event, but then lost my nerve in some fashion. I\u2019d love to hear \u2013 and maybe catching the falling knives is a way to segue into this; I don\u2019t know, but I found that very interesting to read about, but how do you think about sitting on a position like that and timing? What determines the \u201cgo\u201d command for deploying? Howard Marks: You have really touched on an extremely important topic. Most of us have an inherent bias. Most of us are essentially cautious or essentially aggressive. Probably, more people are essentially cautious than aggressive. So one of the most important things is to assess ourselves, understand our biases, and try to overcome them. Now the Tim Ferriss that I heard you describe \u2013 I take that to mean that maybe you were lucky or smart enough to turn cautious leading up to the bubble, the markets fell apart, you\u2019re sitting on cash, you patted yourself on the back for being so smart as to not get caught, and you watched. What you didn\u2019t do is turn aggressive at the bottom. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. Howard Marks: And it\u2019s common not to do so. It\u2019s common to \u2013 as you say \u2013 for people to say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump in while this thing is collapsing down. I\u2019m going to wait until the dust has settled and the future is clear. I\u2019m not going to try to catch a falling knife.\u201d But it is when the knives are falling that the people are most terrified that the best bargains are available. So if you wait until the dust settles, the bargains are gone, and that\u2019s what happened at the end of \u201908. You mentioned that in distressed debt, we put $500 million a week to work in the last 15 weeks following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and across the firm, something like $650 million a week for 15 weeks \u2013 that\u2019s $10 billion. But, the key is that it was at a time when essentially nobody else would. We got great bargains. By the time the end of \u201908 rolled around, the hedge funds that were getting withdrawals had either satisfied their withdrawals or gated, and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What does \u201cgated\u201d mean? Howard Marks: Told clients they couldn\u2019t have their money back for a while. And so the selling abated. A few people saw the great values, and with the selling \u2013 and thus, the fear \u2013 having reduced, they were able to come forward, and prices started to move up. Then, it was too late! If you\u2019re trying to buy in a falling market, you can buy all you want at successively lower prices, but if you\u2019re trying to buy large amounts in a rising market, your own buying puts the price up. You\u2019re your own worst enemy. You can\u2019t get much at low prices. So one of the keys to successful investing is to either be unemotional or, at minimum, act like you are. The great investors I know behave in an unemotional fashion. Warren Buffett couldn\u2019t care less, David Tepper couldn\u2019t care less, and so forth. My own partner Bruce Karsh is very stalwart. But part of it is that we support each other at the bottom. It\u2019s not easy. I say in the book \u2013 I recount some of the things we\u2019ve done right with regard to cycled extremes, but I absolutely don\u2019t want to give the impression that it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s terrifying. Others are terrified. That\u2019s why they\u2019re selling. That\u2019s why they\u2019re saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the price is, just get me out.\u201d That\u2019s when you want to buy. But the things that terrify them into selling will also terrify you. You have to overcome it. Tim Ferriss: How much of that stoic resilience or stoic composure is nature versus nurture \u2013 born versus trained \u2013 from what you\u2019ve observed and experienced? And if a portion of it is trained, how would you suggest to someone that they develop that ability? Howard Marks: I don\u2019t want to answer categorically. I think it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier if you\u2019re born that way. To teach yourself to be unemotional is to counter human nature, and by definition, it can\u2019t be easy. Other than where we are in the cycle and what\u2019s going to happen in the next six months, this is probably the question I get the most often. How can you teach yourself to be unemotional, to be contrarian, to be a second-level thinker? There is no easy answer. In the first book, on the subject of what I call second-level thinking, I say, \u201cThey say you can\u2019t coach height. All the coaching in the world will not make your team taller.\u201d So I don\u2019t know, frankly, whether people can teach themselves to be unemotional, but clearly, if you are as emotional as others, you will probably succumb to the same errors. Tim Ferriss: So let\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d love to back into this type of\u2026not psychological profiling, but an examination of this type of resilience, maybe indirectly \u2013 maybe it\u2019ll come up, maybe it won\u2019t \u2013 and I might get the total duration incorrect, but you mentioned a name, Bruce Karsh, that I\u2019d love to bring up yet again. He may come up repeatedly. You\u2019ve had a 23-year partnership, is that right? Howard Marks: 31. Oaktree is 23 years old, but we worked together for eight years before that. Tim Ferriss: Prior to that, all right. So if you were trying to hire a 25-year-old version of Bruce, what would you be looking for? Howard Marks: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what he is. He\u2019s super smart. That goes without saying. He is highly competitive. He\u2019s a chess player. Again, most of the people I know who are good investors are game players \u2013 either backgammon, chess, or something like that. We are inherently competitive. He\u2019s also very analytical, and he\u2019s kind of a grinder, and I would describe myself as being intuitive and a quick decider \u2013 thinking slow and fast, Kahneman. I\u2019m a fast thinker. You tell me a problem, I tell you my answer in short order and I\u2019m done with it, for the most part. Bruce will think about it longer, come to his conclusion, and then he\u2019ll come back the next day and say, \u201cYou know, I was thinking about it last night. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, and here\u2019s why.\u201d Or, \u201cI don\u2019t think you were right, and here\u2019s why.\u201d And he\u2019ll grind on it for hours and days. I think this is part of the secret to our success. Again, something I once wrote on the subject of a good partnership was \u201cShared values and complementary skills.\u201d If you have a partner that has different values than you do \u2013 for example, Bob wants to make the most money possible and Ed wants to operate with integrity. Those are largely contradictory. So I think it\u2019s very important to share values, but I also think it\u2019s important to not be the same person, a copy of yourself. If it\u2019s a copy of yourself, you don\u2019t need it. The person should bring skills that you don\u2019t bring and maybe operate in ways you don\u2019t, and I think it\u2019s probably helpful that I\u2019m intuitive and he\u2019s analytical. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve heard \u2013 well, \u201cheard\u201d is not the right verb \u2013 I\u2019ve read\u2026I believe it was Buffett who said that Charlie Munger has something along the lines of the best 60-second mind he\u2019s ever encountered. It sounds like you also have a very highly developed fast thinking capacity. How is it similar or different from Charlie Munger\u2019s 60-second mind? Howard Marks: Well, first of all, it\u2019s a daunting comparison. I would never put myself in a category with Charlie. He\u2019s brilliant, and one of the best thinkers there is. But the main thing is that he has read more broadly. He\u2019s had another 22 years to read further, and he was probably always a broader reader than I was, and so it\u2019s his ability to call on these references. In a way, it\u2019s kind of silly to think that we can reinvent all the wisdom in the world. It\u2019s great to borrow from others, and Charlie does that broadly, and I try to do it, but he just knows more. Tim Ferriss: I think we\u2019ll almost certainly come back to Warren and Charlie more in this conversation, but I want to return to Bruce because you mentioned the complementary skill sets, and of course, you\u2019ve written about him and mentioned him quite a bit, and I want to quickly pull up a few lines in the new book. \u201cBruce and I had exchanged ideas and backed each other up almost daily over that period\u201d \u2013 this is the preceding text \u2013 \u201cand my give and take with him, especially in the most difficult of times, has played a particularly indispensable part in the development of the approaches to cycles on which this book is based.\u201d Could you share an example of a back-and-forth or disagreement during a difficult time or with a particular decision? Is that possible, just so we have a real-world example of the interplay between the two of you? Howard Marks: We normally don\u2019t debate individual investments because he operates more at that level and I operate more at the big-picture level within Oaktree, but I think a good example is in the period we\u2019ve been talking about a couple of time \u2013 we mentioned the last 15 weeks of \u201908 \u2013 it was a very tough period because Lehman Brothers had gone bankrupt, Bear Stearns had disappeared, and Merrill Lynch had been absorbed by Bank of America, Washington Mutual, and Wachovia Bank. It looked like falling dominoes, and people were talking about the fact that it looked like Morgan Stanley was next and Goldman was right behind that. So you just had to conclude that the financial world was either going to end, or it wasn\u2019t. You couldn\u2019t analyze it, you couldn\u2019t prove anything about the future, and so it required an almost gamesman-like approach to whether you buy or not, and we would talk about that in that sense, and we were both very comfortable talking about it in that sense. What we concluded was that if the world ended, it didn\u2019t matter what we did, but if the world didn\u2019t end and we hadn\u2019t bought, we hadn\u2019t done our job. So buck up and do your job. Now, the great thing is that half the days, Bruce would come to me \u2013 because he would be lying in bed at night, thinking about this stuff \u2013 and say, \u201cYou know what? I think we\u2019re going too fast. I think we should slow down.\u201d And half the days, he would say, \u201cI think we\u2019re going too slow.\u201d So I would play devil\u2019s advocate and support his decision, but try to show him the other side, and he would do that with me. That\u2019s why we got it done. But, as I say in the introduction to the book from which you read, I don\u2019t think either of us could have done as good a job alone. I think the devil\u2019s advocacy\u2013 but in a supportive way \u2013 really held the key. In one of my memos, I wrote about a reporter who called me up a few days after the bankruptcy of Lehman and said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I said, \u201cWe\u2019re buying.\u201d He said, \u201cYou are?\u201d like it was the craziest thing he\u2019d ever heard. My reaction was, \u201cIf we\u2019re not buying now, when will we?\u201d But it\u2019s been a great partnership \u2013 as you say, 31 years \u2013 never an argument. Tim Ferriss: Never an argument? Howard Marks: Never an argument. Intellectual disagreements, but never an emotional argument, and the key is respect. Even when we disagree, we respect. The great thing about that is you sit down, you disagree, maybe you don\u2019t come to a conclusion, and then you go back to your corners, and he says, \u201cWell, you know what? Maybe Howard\u2019s right.\u201d I say, \u201cMaybe Bruce is right,\u201d and then you can have a productive discussion. If your reaction is, \u201cThat moron,\u201d then you can\u2019t benefit from what he has to say. Tim Ferriss: For people who are hoping to exhibit that type of poise and respect for someone else, are there any tactical recommendations you might have? And the reason I ask that is \u2013 I no longer live in Silicon Valley, but I did for 17 years, and you see cofounder splits all the time. Some of them go the distance, but a lot of them end up as fatalities, and you can almost see the writing on the wall when the respect goes out the window, and it\u2019s just a matter of time for a lot of these guys. For people who are in partnership \u2013 for the time being, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s in a business capacity or an investing capacity \u2013 what are some of the tools of the trade that don\u2019t let it escalate? Do you walk out of the room if you\u2019re starting to get heated or do you avoid, in a systemic way, given the policies of the firm, any type of mission-critical decisions that become the object of an argument, if that makes any sense? When the stakes are high, what are some recommendations you would have when, perhaps, emotions are starting to escalate? Howard Marks: The only issue I would take, Tim, is that you started with assuming you\u2019re in a partnership. I think you have to start sooner. With whom do you get in a partnership? You have to share values, and you shouldn\u2019t be partners with somebody you\u2019re not going to like, enjoy spending time with, and be able to work with constructively when the stuff hits the fan. That\u2019s really the key. So I believe that solving most personnel or managerial problems starts at the beginning with the hiring decision or the combination decision. So just don\u2019t get into business with somebody you\u2019re not going to be able to live with. It\u2019s kind of like a marriage. Tim Ferriss: Do you stress-test their ability to handle potential high-stress situations in some real or simulated fashion? In, say, hiring decisions, do you look back at their history and reference checks to assess that? How do you assess whether someone is going to keep their cool or not? Howard Marks: Well, we don\u2019t do simulations or wargames, but we do \u2013 that\u2019s an important part of reference checking. You have to look beyond whether the person is smart and a moneymaker. We have a \u201cno assholes\u201d rule at Oaktree, and I think that solves a lot of problems. There are lots of people in the world who can make you a lot of money, but you may not want to be in business with them, and it may not be viable long-term. Now, it\u2019s hard to absolutely follow that rule because really smart moneymakers are very tempting, but I think it\u2019s really important. But then, once you are in business together and you have the inevitable disagreement, I think one of the most important things is to first acknowledge the limits on what you know. If you go in with some humility, then you\u2019re unlikely to have a fight to death \u2013 that is, to the death of your partnership \u2013 over an issue. It\u2019s great to say \u2013 people should wake up in the morning and start the day by practicing, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d It\u2019s a great thing to say, and not enough people say it. The flip side of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is what I said before about our discussions. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s right.\u201d And so I think that\u2019s important \u2013 humility. Number two: Again, a control of emotion. Don\u2019t get into fights just to show who\u2019s more manly or equate winning the argument with success because if you\u2019re in a business situation and you\u2019re fighting for something that ultimately proves out to be a mistake, your success in winning the argument will lead to a failure. So don\u2019t confuse winning the argument with coming to the best decision. Again, try to limit the testosterone. I think that really gets in the way. Tim Ferriss: One of the many things that I really enjoy about your writing is that it serves \u2013 for me, at least \u2013 as a reflection on clear thinking that transcends investing. It applies to, if not all, so many areas of life \u2013 at least, those governed by the prefrontal cortex \u2013 and one that caught my eye while I was reading, which is Page 15 in the new book, is the following. I\u2019d just like to read it. It\u2019s not very long. \u201cIn addition to an opinion regarding what\u2019s going to happen, people should have a view on the likelihood that their opinion will prove correct. \u201cSome events can be predicted with substantial confidence \u2013 example given: Will a given investment-grade bond pay the interest it promises \u2013 some are uncertain \u2013 example: Will Amazon still be the leader in online retailing in 10 years? \u2013 and some are entirely unpredictable \u2013 example: Will the stock market go up or down next month? It\u2019s my point here that not all predictions should be treated as equally likely to be correct, and thus, they shouldn\u2019t be relied on equally. I don\u2019t think most people are as aware of this as they should be.\u201d Could you expand on this a bit, if that\u2019s possible, and maybe give some examples of how you or other people you respect use that type of heuristic when making decisions \u2013 or, I suppose, just reflecting reality in their own minds or perceiving things Howard Marks: Sure. We all have opinions, and we hold our opinions because we believe in them. Nobody ever says, \u201cMy opinion is X, and I think I\u2019m wrong.\u201d We all think that our opinions are correct. And again, the world becomes a better place \u2013 an easier place to navigate if we admit that even though there are opinions, they may be wrong. How does an investor like me deal with the fact that he doesn\u2019t believe in future predictions? The answer is I say \u2013 and I have opinions on other subjects \u2013 but I say it\u2019s one thing to have an opinion and it\u2019s another to believe and act as if it\u2019s right. If you just say, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong,\u201d the world gets easier, in my opinion \u2013 easier to succeed, less easy to navigate day to day. And a big theme of the book is that we have to view the future not as an event which is predetermined and predictable or determined already, but as a range of possibilities, as a probability distribution. I went to the World\u2019s Fair in Flushing in 1964, I think it was, and I stood before an exhibit that IBM had, and typically of technology 50 years ago, it was the most simplistic thing you could imagine. They had a slot at the top and a bunch of balls, and the balls came through the slot, and there were a bunch of pegs in the grid. When the balls hit the pegs, they started to fuse, and by the time they got to the bottom, they were in a bell-shaped distribution. I think that was probably my first exposure to a distribution, but it\u2019s beautiful, and that\u2019s how life is. The future is a distribution of possibilities, and if we\u2019re really smart, we know what the possibilities are, and we may have an idea of which are more likely and less likely, but we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, and I think we have to behave that way. Now, some things we know more, some things we know less. We shouldn\u2019t get confused. But the most important single thing is to not have the same degree of conviction about all of our opinions. Tim Ferriss: Do you apply a one-to-10 numerical value? Is it more of a light-medium-strong? How do you think about that yourself? Howard Marks: Well, I think it\u2019s certainly not \u2013 for the most part, I\u2019m not a quantifier. If you read the book, I would hope you would be struck by how few numbers there are in it. One of the great quotes which is broadly attributed to Einstein \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was Einstein \u2013 is \u201cNot everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted.\u201d So the most important insights to life are non-quantitative, but when I have an opinion, I try to be conscious of how likely it is to be correct, and I try really hard not to always assume that I\u2019m right. By the way, let me add one thing. Henry Kaufman, who was the chief economist of Salomon Brothers in the \u201870s at a time when America was riven with hyperinflations \u2013 15%, 16%, 17% a year \u2013 nobody could figure out how to stop it, and the world was really a very difficult place to live. There were two guys, Kaufman and Al Wojnilower, at First Boston, who were called \u201cDr. Gloom\u201d and \u201cDr. Doom.\u201d But Kaufman said two kinds of people lose a lot of money: The people who know nothing and the people who know everything. Very few of us know nothing, but it\u2019s really important not to assume we know everything. Tim Ferriss: Is there any reading you\u2019ve done \u2013 or, maybe it\u2019s just real-life experience in the trenches of doing this day in and day out \u2013 but for people who want to develop that \u2013 I saw that you\u2019re what seems like a reader or fan of some of what Nassim Taleb has put out, and he talks about epistemological arrogance quite a bit, the belief that we know it all or more than we actually know. How would you suggest \u2013 are there any resources, letters, books, memos, or talks that you might recommend to people who want to really cultivate that awareness of limited knowledge? Howard Marks: Well, when you started to ask that question, I did fast-forward to Nassim Nicholas Taleb and his book Fooled by Randomness. I think it\u2019s a really important book in terms of its ideas. It\u2019s really about how much randomness there is in our world. Now it\u2019s primarily about the world of investing, not the general world. His example is that if you\u2019re a dentist \u2013 he picks on dentists a lot in the book \u2013 Tim Ferriss: He picks on economists, too. Howard Marks: Yes \u2013 and you always fill a tooth the same way, you always get a successful filling, whereas in the investment business, there\u2019s nothing you can do the same every time that will always get a successful outcome because of the changeability and randomness in the world. This is extremely important. We have to think about the world as a probability distribution. One of the things that interests me most is when you look at history, you say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know so much about the future, but history \u2013 that\u2019s done. That\u2019s settled. We know what happened. We know what the truth was.\u201d But, Taleb uses a concept called \u201calternative histories,\u201d the other things that reasonably, probably could have happened, but didn\u2019t. When you look at a historical event, you have to ask yourself if that outcome was inevitable, in which case it demonstrates a truth, or if it was subject to randomness and other things could have happened just as well. In a memo around \u201906, I talked about the Rose Bowl game between USC and the University of Texas, and USC was highly touted as the best team in the history of college football, and \u2013 I\u2019m not going to go through all of it; I hope readers will take a look at it \u2013 but in the end, they lost on one play, so nobody talked about them as being the best football team in history. My point was \u2013 and I entitled this section \u201cWhat\u2019s Real\u201d \u2013 maybe they were the best team in history, and maybe the fact that they weren\u2019t successful on that one play that the whole game depended on was because the wind was blowing left to right or right to left at that moment. And so we should not be too firm in our conclusions. I guess the recurrent theme is a lack of certainty. But I really would push people to Fooled by Randomness. There\u2019s a little book by John Kenneth Galbraith called The Short History of Financial Euphoria that has a great quote. He said, \u201cWe have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don\u2019t know and the ones who don\u2019t know they don\u2019t know.\u201d That has been very inspirational for me. Tim Ferriss: I was \u2013 I don\u2019t think this was attributed to you, but I came across it while looking at some highlights of your memos in prep for this conversation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s attributed to you, but someone said, \u201cDumb money can become smart money if it accepts its limitations.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you would agree with that, but it stuck with me as maybe \u2013 not necessarily forecasters, but at least, people who cultivate becoming aware of what they don\u2019t know. Howard Marks: Sure. Well, I think \u2013 first of all, knowing what you don\u2019t know is one of the keys to success in anything. Dirty Harry said a man should know his limitations. I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 it\u2019s not my quote. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that dumb money can become smart money, but I would say that one of the ways to avoid being dumb money is to not act as if you know things you don\u2019t know. Maybe by the time I get done giving the quote, I\u2019ll be able to remember who said it, but somebody very wise said \u2013 Mark Twain, that\u2019s it \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not what you don\u2019t know that gets you into trouble. It\u2019s what you know for certain that just ain\u2019t true.\u201d That is so important. There\u2019s nothing more dangerous in life than being sure you know something that you don\u2019t know. If you have excess certitude, you will do things boldly in dangerous ways and to dangerous extents that have the ability to get you into trouble and get you killed. But a sentence that starts off with, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but\u2026\u201d is unlikely to lead to fatal action. To me, the distinction is so clear and so inarguable that I think this is one of the most important things for life. Know your limitations. Tim Ferriss: A little bit earlier, you mentioned how you could potentially say to yourself in the morning, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. Maybe he or she is right.\u201d It makes me think of some of these memento mori-type quotes that may be apocryphal from ancient Rome, where they have someone behind the emperor when he\u2019s being paraded through the streets saying, \u201cYou\u2019re just a man, you\u2019re just a man,\u201d something like that. I know this is seemingly maybe not on the same topic, but nonetheless, I want to ask about it. Do you have any particular routines or habits in the first hour or two of your day \u2013 whether it\u2019s now or whether you were \u2013 if there was a particularly productive period in your professional life where you feel like those routines or habits were important, does anything come to mind? Howard Marks: I don\u2019t have stylized routines. I would just say that my life is pretty calm, and I try to keep it that way. Tim Ferriss: What would be a symptom of it not being calm, and how would you respond to that? Howard Marks: Well, watching too much political TV and getting exercised about what you see on TV would be a good example. That\u2019s negative energy. That\u2019s not going to contribute to your effectiveness in the day. Now, the fact that I don\u2019t get exercised about what I see on the news shows is not purposeful. Tim Ferriss: So up to this point, we\u2019ve talked a fair amount about the importance of avoiding hubris, of understanding your limitations, and the incompleteness of your knowledge. How do you balance that with knowing your strengths well enough or having conviction in evidence to the extent that you can then take action? Howard Marks: Sure. That\u2019s a great question, Tim. Clearly, it\u2019s essential to balance. You don\u2019t want to be the person who thinks he knows everything, but you can\u2019t be very successful in life \u2013 especially not investing \u2013 if you think you\u2019re the person who knows nothing. There is no magic in it. There\u2019s no rule, no method. It\u2019s just an awareness. But we have to feel we know enough to take action. Now, most successful people \u2013 most smart people \u2013 don\u2019t have a problem in that area. They have a history of having their ideas validated for the most part, but it is one of the great conundrums which is methodologically unanswerable. You buy a stock at $80 and it falls to $60. You say, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s cheaper now. I like it more. I\u2019m going to buy more.\u201d You buy more, and then it falls to $40. Is there a point at which you say, \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m wrong and maybe the market is right?\u201d If you throw in the towel and sell every stock you buy when it goes down a little, you can never be successful, but if you ignore the possibility that you\u2019re wrong, you can never be successful, and you have to strike a balance. So when you buy a stock and it goes down a little, you take another look at your analysis. Was there anything you missed? Did your analysis hold water? Maybe you talk to some people that you respect to get their opinions. But again, if you\u2019re too sure, you\u2019re in trouble, and if you\u2019re too unsure, you\u2019re in trouble. You have to strike a balance. Tim Ferriss: If we come back to the hypothetical example you gave \u2013 someone buying at $60, then it drops to $40, then to $30, then to $20 \u2013 to avoid being in that position where you are offering yourself the option of buying or selling at each of those check-in points, what do you decide in advance so that you don\u2019t make those interim mistakes or you don\u2019t even make those decisions or look at them to begin with? Howard Marks: That\u2019s not my approach or Oaktree\u2019s approach. We don\u2019t have pre-set rules. Everybody says, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just set a role?\u201d There are things called stop-loss orders. You buy something, it goes down 20 percent, and you sell it very time. There is no rule that will ever work in every case. You have a rule that if it goes down 20 percent, you\u2019re out. If it\u2019s 21 and you sell, it might go up 100, or if it goes down 10 and you don\u2019t sell, it might never go up again. There can\u2019t be a rule that always works. Just before the publication of my other book, I had lunch with Charlie Munger, and at the end of the lunch, when I got up to go, he said, \u201cNow, just remember, none of this is meant to be easy. Anybody who thinks it\u2019s easy is stupid.\u201d These things cannot be reduced to a rule. The market operates so as to confound rule-makers. I wrote a memo five years ago called \u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy.\u201d It all comes down to judgment. If we\u2019re going to have superior investment performance, we have to have superior judgment. You can work on your processes both intellectually and emotionally, but you can\u2019t\u2026 Superior judgment isn\u2019t something you can order up, and not everybody can necessarily attain it, but I think one of the most important things is to dismiss the concept of a process or rule that always works in the absence of superior judgment. Tim Ferriss: Is the judgment the decision to take a certain path versus another? In other words \u2013 I know I\u2019m going to be bastardizing this \u2013 if an advantage could take the form of access to better information and better analysis of that information, making a better decision with that information that is available, having the courage to act on it and the emotional fortitude to either act on it or sit with that decision \u2013 there may be other behavioral or psychological advantages or disadvantages, and I\u2019m sure there are. When you talk about judgment, is that a particular link in that chain? Howard Marks: I think judgment is everything. For example, just to follow your taxonomy, judgment is knowing when you have information that others don\u2019t, and if you think you know something that others don\u2019t, it\u2019s knowing when yours is likely to be valid and knowing whether you\u2019re likely to be offbeat. It\u2019s understanding how to analyze it. Judgment is the reaching of conclusions based on your analysis, and judgment is all we have to tell us when something goes against us, whether we should hang in or give up. So as I say, I think it\u2019s all judgment. Tim Ferriss: I would imagine a lot of people read your memos and your writing in hopes of developing better judgment, and that while there is no one rule that will work for all circumstances and all cases, there may be certain questions or tools that prove helpful in a greater percentage of cases than others, and to that, I would love to refer to a few things that I have in front of me. One is a letter that you sent to me along with the book, and toward the end of the letter, it says, \u201cI draw on my 50 years of investing experience to provide an orientation to the usual cycles of the economy, corporate profits, the availability of credit, and the securities markets, as well as some of the less ordinary ones \u2013 for example, in distressed debt, investor psychology, and even in success \u2013 but I think potentially, the most useful is the chapter on the cycle and attitudes toward risk. How investors are thinking about risk and behaving toward it at a single point in time might be the single most influential determinant of market position in the cycle, and thus, the best indicator of how we should behave in regard to it.\u201d And I read that chapter \u2013 I believe I had the right chapter \u2013 and there\u2019s a point in this chapter that has a few lines bolded \u2013 which I really appreciate, by the way \u2013 and that is, \u201cIf I could ask only one question regarding each investment I had under consideration, it would be simple: How much optimism is factored into the price?\u201d Could you talk about this question and perhaps give some examples of using it or how people might use it? Howard Marks: Sure. I started in the business in a summer job at Citibank in the summer of \u201968, 50 years ago, and the bank was an investor in what was called the \u201cNifty 50,\u201d the 50 best and fastest-growing companies in America. If you bought the stocks the year I showed up and held them for five years, you lost almost all your money \u2013 in the best companies in America. Then, 10 years later, I switched to the so-called \u201cjunk bond\u201d business \u2013 high-yield bonds. Now I\u2019m lending money to the worst companies in America and I\u2019m making money steadily and consistently. So clearly, buying good things and avoiding bad things can\u2019t be the secret to success in investing. It has to be the price you pay. It\u2019s not what you buy, it\u2019s what you pay. And there\u2019s no asset which is so good that it can\u2019t become overpriced. Of course, this is something that people have to bear in mind when they look at the FANG stocks, and on the other hand \u2013 Tim Ferriss: For those who don\u2019t know, what is FANG? Howard Marks: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and they throw in Alphabet too. So there is no asset which is so good that it can\u2019t be overpriced. There are very few assets which are so bad that they can\u2019t be underpriced and thus a bargain. So what we have to look for if we\u2019re going to be successful investors \u2013 now my school, which is called value investing, puts more emphasis than perhaps venture capital or growth investing, which largely looks for brilliant futures \u2013 but the key is paying a low price relative to something called intrinsic value. If you pay a high price relative to the value, you\u2019re unlikely to do well and you probably have to get lucky to have a good return, but if you pay a low price relative to the intrinsic value, then the odds \u2013 like my book says \u2013 are on your side. So we want low price to value. How do you get low price to value? The answer is low optimism. There are other ways to describe it \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You mean looking for low overall optimism? Howard Marks: Right. In short, the things that everybody feels good about are likely to be the things that are high-priced, and the things that everybody feels bad about are likely to be low-priced, so if you could find a stock where nobody thinks this company could ever have a good day, maybe there\u2019s a chance that it could produce some favorable surprises and make you a lot of money. If there\u2019s a company like the Nifty 50 back in \u201968, where everybody assumed \u2013 literally, Tim \u2013 nothing bad could ever happen to these stocks, then clearly, there has to be so much optimism in the price that there can never be a favorable surprise. We make money from favorable surprises, and if the positive conviction is so high, then by definition, there can never be a favorable surprise. So I think this is a number one concept. Tim Ferriss: I think you said the word \u201cnever\u201d in this hypothetical, exuberant enthusiasm, as someone might say. I believe there are certain words that you dislike using and pay attention to when they come up. Howard Marks: It\u2019s all part of this lack of intellectual hubris. We should never say \u201cnever,\u201d \u201calways,\u201d \u201chas to,\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t.\u201d These expressions are far too absolute to be winners in a world beset by uncertainty and randomness. When you use those words, you tend to get into big trouble. Tim Ferriss: When assessing public sentiment \u2013 it could be really wide, let\u2019s say anyone participating in the S&P 500, or it could be narrower \u2013 but let\u2019s just say we\u2019re looking at the broadest collection of market participants, at least the S&P 500. I was texting with a friend of mine who\u2019s a successful investor but very different stylistically than yourself, and I asked him what some investing pros use to measure how fearful or greedy \u201cthe market\u201d is. Are there go-to indices or polls? He said people use the VIX as a measure of fear. He said some people might use something like yield on junk bonds as a measure \u2013 in other words, low yield equals complacent market. It seems so difficult to keep track of the media as a whole, although certainly it becomes obvious at some point if it\u2019s all negative or all positive. Are there particular indicators that you like to pay attention to or your firm likes to at least keep an eye on? Howard Marks: In the old book, there\u2019s a chapter that talks about the importance of taking the temperature of the market, knowing where we stand, and it includes a checklist \u2013 largely tongue-in-cheek \u2013 called the \u201cPoor Man\u2019s Guide to Market Assessment.\u201d It basically asks some simple questions. What\u2019s going on? If a new fund comes out, does it sell out immediately or does it struggle? If an investor goes to a cocktail party \u2013 there you are. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s also in the new book. Howard Marks: Oh, it\u2019s also in the new book. If an investor like me goes to a cocktail party, is he the center of attention that everybody wants to talk to? Well, that\u2019s probably a sign that interest in the market is high. Or is he pushed into a corner and everybody wants to talk to the athletes and the venture capital guys? That\u2019s probably an indication that interest in my part of the market is too low, and that bargains may be available. When you turn on the TV, is all they want to talk about the good news or the bad news? I have some cartoons in the new book \u2013 old cartoons dredged up from my files \u2013 that demonstrate that virtually everything in the world and in the markets is subject to either a positive or negative interpretation, and if everybody is interpreting everything positively, that tells me that the spirits are too high, and perhaps ready to be dashed, and vice versa. The greatest thing I was ever taught was back around \u201973 or \u201974. Somebody said, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you about the three stages of the bull market. In the first stage, just a few incredibly insightful people understand that there could be improvement. In the second stage, most people recognize that improvement is actually taking place. In the third stage, everybody and his brother believes that things will only get better forever.\u201d Now, I think that one, this is a very accurate description of the world; two, clearly, if you buy in the first stage when only a few people understand the potential for improvement, you\u2019re going to pay a low price because there isn\u2019t much optimism in the price. Then, as you progress to the second and third stage, the unanticipated improvement takes place. That gives the market a favorable surprise. The stock prices or the asset prices rise in response to those favorable surprises. But you eventually reach a point where the good news convinces people that it\u2019s going to go on forever, and when everybody believes that things will get better forever, clearly, it\u2019s likely that so much optimism is in the stock price that it\u2019s dangerous and unlikely to yield a profit. So I think that the three stages of the bull market \u2013 and conversely, of the bear market \u2013 are really important, not as a moneymaking rule, but as something to bear in mind and watch out for. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to ask you a few questions that you may not like, but that my fans will kill me for if I don\u2019t ask. First, where do you think we are at the moment? Of course it has to be time-stamped. We\u2019re talking in August of 2018. What has you worried? What has you optimistic, if you\u2019re optimistic about anything? Howard Marks: Sure. Well, where are we? For the last 10 years, ever since the crisis, people have been asking that question in the form of \u201cWhat inning are we in?\u201d When they asked it in late \u201908, what they really meant was, \u201cHow much longer will the pain go on?\u201d Now, what they\u2019re asking is, \u201cHow much longer will the pleasure go on, and the bull market, and the economic recovery?\u201d I think we\u2019re in the eighth inning. Now you don\u2019t have to time-stamp it because I\u2019ve been saying this for a while and I\u2019m likely to continue to do so. But about a year ago I came to the realization that that observation \u2013 even if accurate \u2013 is of limited use because unlike baseball, we don\u2019t know how many innings there are in a game. This is a big distinction. In a normal baseball game, we know there are nine innings. If I say we\u2019re in the eighth and if I say it accurately, that means the good times are about to end. But in economies and markets, there is no fixed duration. So the bull market \u2013 this is the tenth year. That\u2019s a long time. In the economic recovery, this month, we have begun the tenth year. The longest economic recovery in recent history is 10 years, so these observations start to tell you not that it\u2019s going to end, but that the likelihood of its continuing is declining. The odds are not on your side. When you\u2019re in the tenth year, the odds of having 10 more years of recovery seemingly are not good. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some reason why there has never been a recovery of more than 10 years, but we have to wonder if there is. But on the other hand, we can\u2019t be too sure. Now I believe that for many years, this economic recovery was the slowest on record. That was probably helpful because that kept excesses from coming into existence that have to be corrected with a downturn. You asked about the good news. The good news is that the economy is functioning at a high level, we just had a quarter of unusually rapid growth, unemployment is declining, and our economy is the envy of the world. Stock prices \u2013 which were very high when measured by price/earnings ratio last year \u2013 are not so expensive this year because the earnings have been supercharged by the tax bill. The projected earnings of the S&P 500 are way up this year \u2013 23 percent, I think, which is unusual \u2013 and everything else being equal, higher earnings mean a lower price/earnings ratio, so by most measures, stocks are only slightly expensive at this point in time. So that\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that interest rates are likely to increase, and interest rates increase the burden of debt on companies, and when bonds yield more, they offer more competition for stocks. Clearly, there are a lot of uncertainties in the macro world, in the geopolitical world, and in the political world, the greatest of which is the possibility of a trade war, which almost everybody thinks would be extremely negative, not only for the U.S. and for the people who engage in the trade war, but for everyone. I think that interestingly, what we\u2019ve been talking about is assessing the level of investor psychology. I don\u2019t believe that investor psychology is terribly frothy. The way I\u2019ve put it in the past is that people are not thinking bullish, but they\u2019re acting bullish. A lot of people have moved into higher-risk investments in order to get the returns they want because right now, safe investments \u2013 treasuries, high-grade bonds, cash, and money markets \u2013 offer so little. So people have been forced to move out the risk curve and take more risk, and that makes the world a riskier place for you and me. I borrowed a phrase from my late father-in-law, who said that those people could be described as handcuff volunteers. They\u2019re doing things not because they want to, but because they have to. But the effect on the market is the same. When people move to riskier actions, it makes the market riskier for everyone. Tim Ferriss: So if we were to consider all of that, if you had, say, three people come to you and you had to give them some response because it\u2019s your mother-in-law, people in the family, so you have to give them some kind of response \u2013 feel free to ask some clarifying questions, but let\u2019s say someone has $100,000 to invest, $1 million to invest, and $10 million to invest. So $100,000, $1 million, and $10 million, they make $100,000 a year, and that is going to remain stable and predictable. Let\u2019s just assume that on the income side. They are very cautious \u2013 I think that like a lot of people, the loss aversion and pain of losing $100 hurts much more than the joy they derive from making $100 \u2013 and they have their investable funds, $100,000, $1 million, and $10 million, in cash or cash-like equivalents \u2013 some of these safe vehicles \u2013 currently, and they say, \u201cHoward, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d What are your thoughts? Howard Marks: I think that one of the most important things in investing is to make people comfortable. It\u2019s a mistake to sit there and say, \u201cYou should do this, you should do that,\u201d regardless of people\u2019s comfort level because if you violate their comfort level, if you force them into things that are too risky for them and then things go bad, they\u2019re unlikely to do the right thing. They\u2019re more likely to panic and sell on the lows, which is the cardinal sin of investing. So it\u2019s very important to assess people\u2019s needs and ability to withstand tough times. Clearly, the person who makes $100,000 and has $100,000 doesn\u2019t have a big margin of safety for tough times, and they should invest more conservatively. The person with $10 million, depending on his or her psychology, probably would be willing to stomach some losses in the pursuit of big gains. Now people always overestimate in advance the equanimity with which they would greet losses. Back in 1997-1999, when the stock market and tech stocks were rocketing along, I think what a lot of people said is, \u201cMy 401(k) is doing so great; I wouldn\u2019t mind if I lost a third of my money. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Believe me, when they lost a third of their money, they weren\u2019t okay. But my mantra for the last few years has been \u201cMove forward, but with caution.\u201d So in varying degrees to those three people, I would say, \u201cWe are investing every day, we are endeavoring to be fully invested today other than in funds that are strictly designated as standby funds for the crisis, and we are definitely taking risks, but with caution.\u201d We\u2019re a cautious firm. We invest in risky asset classes \u2013 high-yield bonds, distressed debt, real estates, emerging market stocks and bonds, et cetera \u2013 these are risky assets, and Oaktree has always taken a low-risk approach, a controlled-risk approach, to those asset classes. So when I say \u201cwith caution,\u201d I mean with more caution than usual. I think this is a time for more caution than usual, and that\u2019s what I would tell those people. So I think that the outlook is not so bad and the prices are not so high that you have to practice maximum defensiveness, go to cash, and suffer a 1 percent return on cash, but I think the outlook is not so good and prices are not so low that this is a time for aggressiveness, and I wouldn\u2019t be aggressive. I think one way that I help myself make these decisions \u2013 and it might be helpful to your listeners \u2013 is I constantly remind myself and others that as an investor, there are really two key risks that we face every day. Now, the first one is obvious and everybody knows about it. It\u2019s the risk of losing money. What\u2019s the second? It\u2019s not so obvious. It\u2019s a little more subtle. It\u2019s the risk of missing opportunity. When reminded of the twin risks, most people would say, \u201cI think that\u2019s right. The truth is, I don\u2019t want to lose a lot of money, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t want to miss all the opportunities, so I\u2019m going to compromise. I\u2019m going to balance the two. I\u2019m going to do something in the middle.\u201d That makes sense. Other than daredevils and scaredy-cats, everybody should do something in the middle. Exactly where in the middle is debatable and should be tailored to their own psyche and financial position. So the interesting question is \u201cWhat about today?\u201d Today, should you be in your normal balance between the twin risks or should you be different? Should you be in a higher-risk position because so many things yield so little or should you be in a lower-risk position because there are so many uncertainties? And I actually agree with the latter. So fully invested \u2013 and being cautious does not mean being in cash \u2013 and with everything you want to do in the investment business, there are higher- and lower-risk ways to do it, and I think today is a time for the lower-risk ways. Tim Ferriss: This is not the first time I\u2019ve asked a question like this, but the last time I asked the first part of that, which is about someone who makes $100,000 a year and has $100,000 to spend, I was actually at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting a long time ago. It was my first and only time there, and I was so excited to be there. It\u2019s Woodstock for investor nerds. There was so much excitement. People were camped out front to be in line. I was part of that, and I asked someone working there where the microphone was that was hardest to get to, and then I sprinted over there, and I was able to ask Warren and Charlie this question \u2013 and of course, you know them, and their responses can be very short. I said, \u201cHypothetically, if someone were making $100,000 a year and had $100,000 to deploy in some way, how would you suggest they invest that capital?\u201d It was along the lines of, \u201cInvest in the S&P 500 or a low-cost index fund in the S&P 500 and get back to work.\u201d I found that very dissatisfying, but in retrospect, certainly not the worst advice that you could give someone. How do you \u2013 with what do you disagree with Warren the most? On what do you guys not see eye to eye? Howard Marks: Tim, there\u2019s a book out called The Warren Buffett Way, and I was asked to write the foreword for the latest edition, and I wrote something called \u201cWhat Makes Warren Buffett Warren Buffett?\u201d and I listed the things that characterize him: extremely high IQ, unemotional, great analyst, understands what\u2019s important, looks at the things that are important and figures out their import, ignores the things that are unimportant, and on and on like that. The last one was one of the most important: he\u2019s not afraid of getting fired. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about the interim consequences of error. Most people do. So his advice was to invest in an index fund. That\u2019s fine as far as it goes, but how much? Should the person who has $100,000 put the whole thing in the stock market, and especially, should they do it today? If they do it all today, we\u2019re confident that 20 years from now, they\u2019re going to have a lot more money and they\u2019re going to be really happy. What about a year from now? Not everybody is financially and emotionally able to live through a decline. So as I said, the first purpose of investing \u2013 especially for people who have more money than they need to eat \u2013 should be to make you comfortable. When I started at Citibank 50 years ago, they had a cartoon on the wall. It said, \u201cScared money never wins,\u201d and it\u2019s true. So everybody should invest only up to their comfort level. I certainly agree with Warren that for most people, they can improve on an index fund, and I\u2019m not saying that Warren says that everybody should put 100 percent of their net worth in the index fund \u2013 clearly, they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 and I was once at a talk, and I was preceded by a college professor I won\u2019t identify \u2013 Warren always says, \u201cPraise by name, criticize by category,\u201d so I\u2019ll only say I was preceded by a college professor. This guy is known for a pro-stock attitude, and what he said was, \u201cIf you are of average risk tolerance, you should have 85 percent of your money in\u201d \u2013 no. \u201cIf you have below-average risk tolerance you should have 85 percent of your money in the stock market, if you\u2019re average, 105, and if you\u2019re aggressive, 125 percent of your net worth should be in the stock market.\u201d I just think that most people can\u2019t live in the short run with the consequences of being that deeply invested. Being human, we are our own worst enemy. Everything that goes on in the world and the market conspires to make people buy when things are going well and prices are high and sell when things are going badly and prices are low, and fighting that is the number one theme of the book, and it\u2019s the number one theme of success. Tim Ferriss: Just from personal experience \u2013 and I mentioned this earlier \u2013 looking at my response in 2008\u2026 I bought a house in 2007 with some very unfortunate mortgage terms and made some very bad decisions with money that I had in the stock market at that time. I think in part, it was because I couldn\u2019t have known how I would respond under those circumstances, and when I filled out these very templated forms, of course, for whoever it was at the time \u2013 I won\u2019t mention anyone by name, but it was, \u201cTo what extent would you be comfortable with a drop in your portfolio over one quarter or one year?\u201d That was the form of the question, and it had 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent. I thought, \u201cWell, 30 percent, maybe,\u201d pulling an answer out of thin air. I had to answer it to get through the online form. But I had never experienced anything similar to that. This just came to mind because I\u2019m looking at a book on your shelf, Bringing Down the House, about games. We were talking about games earlier. As I understand it, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett play a fair amount of bridge. Certainly, many people in the investing world \u2013 including some people who are really fantastic, some of the guys from Renaissance and so on \u2013 play poker, and then you have backgammon. What do you play, what do you think the game that they select says about the person, if anything, and could the game they select help someone to assess their risk tolerance for larger types of investing or other ways to accurately determine that in any way? Howard Marks: I think \u201caccurately determine,\u201d yes, \u201cquantify,\u201d no. But I think that we can get a handle on our degree of risk tolerance and risk aversion, and we should. I was with my son and one of his friends this week, and his friend is a great chess player. The interesting thing about people who play chess is that in chess, there\u2019s no randomness. There\u2019s no dice to roll, no wind to blow, and no card to pick from the deck. All the information is on the board and everybody has all the information. So it tells you something about an intellectual process. That goes all the way out to craps, where everything is in play all the time based on randomness. So maybe which game we like tells us something about ourselves, but how we play also tells us about ourselves. Backgammon, which is one of my main games, is highly probability-intensive because it\u2019s all the dice \u2013 it\u2019s the dice and the skill, but the dice mean a lot. In any situation, with any throw of the dice, there are aggressive and defensive ways to play. Probably the interesting thing is if you played and I watched you for a couple hours, I would know if you were aggressive or defensive, risk-averse or risk-tolerant, and you should be able to do the same for yourself. As I said before, one of the great things is to understand ourselves, and without that, we\u2019re really in trouble. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the things that otherwise smart people miss about cycles or misconceptions that you believe to be true \u2013 like Mark Twain said \u2013 that just ain\u2019t so? Howard Marks: I think the biggest mistake you can make is to ignore the repetitive nature of the cyclical pattern. In his book Principles, Ray Dalio talks about how much analysis he and his partners did, the conclusion of which is the ability to look at what\u2019s going on in the world or in the market and say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s another one of those.\u201d Life becomes very easy when you have studied the past to the extent that you have seen the recurring patterns and you can recognize them when they come up again. So I think that\u2019s extremely important. But, the other thing is \u2013 and I think the guiding quote of the book is another one from Mark Twain, \u201cHistory does not repeat, but it does rhyme.\u201d History does not repeat. The cycles are never the same in terms of amplitude, speed, duration, cause, or ramifications, but there are themes that repeat that can help us to identify and properly respond to cyclical occurrences. So I say in the book that I\u2019ve been in the high-yield bond business now for 40 years, and there was a time where there arose a body of thought that most defaults occur on bonds\u2019 second anniversaries since their issuance. I don\u2019t think there was anything magical about the second anniversary, and if people believed that, then they would sell all the bonds they had that were 23 months old and buy them back when they were 25 months old if they had survived, but I don\u2019t think they would accomplish anything by that because I think they were assigning an import to a number that was not valid. So I think it\u2019s really important to recognize cycles and understand them, but I think it\u2019s unimportant to assign importance to these numbers or rules, but it\u2019s very important to understand what\u2019s going on around us, and when the recovery is old, the bull market is old, the psychology is elevated, the valuations are high, then you should know that the odds are not on your side, and you should take some money off the table and behave in a more cautious way, and vice versa. Tim Ferriss: So I suppose also, on some level, it necessitates cultivating a fair degree of patience. Howard Marks: Patience is essential. There was an investment sage named Peter Bernstein, and he said, \u201cThe market is not an accommodating machine that will give you high returns because you need or want them.\u201d I believe that right now, we\u2019re living in a low-return world, and if you say, \u201cHoward, I need high returns in a low-return world,\u201d the only way to try to get them is by taking a lot of risk, and by definition, taking a lot of risk is not sure to work and could have negative consequences. So I believe that when you\u2019re in a low-return world, you have to accept it and deal accordingly. Now, this comes from muj\u014d, which we started the interview with. I talked about muj\u014d in a memo about 20 years ago entitled \u201cIt Is What It Is.\u201d I think one of the most important things we can do as adults, be it in the investment world or the real world, is to say, \u201cIt is what it is\u201d \u2013 in other words, accept things for what they are, deal with them as they are, don\u2019t spend a lot of time wishing they were different, and certainly, don\u2019t act as if they were different. We have to accept the realities. Tim Ferriss: In my little tiny corner of investing, which is not even worth mentioning in this conversation, but I only bring it up to tie it to how helpful actually reading \u2013 it\u2019s not quite scripture, but Buddhist thinking related to concepts like muj\u014d and Stoic philosophy \u2013 Epictetus and so on \u2013 how helpful that has been to tempering emotional reactivity. You mentioned someone I want to come back to, who is Peter \u2013 is it \u201cBern-steen\u201d or \u201c-stein\u201d? Howard Marks: \u201cBern-steen.\u201d Tim Ferriss: \u201cBern-steen\u201d \u2013 a financial historian who sadly passed away in 2009, I think. I\u2019ve read that you consider him one of the smartest people you\u2019ve ever met. Why is that? Are there any other things that you learned from him? Howard Marks: 48 years ago, when I was a junior analyst following Xerox for Citibank and I would give the portfolio managers at the bank my opinions, one of them came up to me and said, \u201cWho is the best analyst on Wall Street on Xerox?\u201d I said, \u201cThe one who agrees with me the most is so-and-so.\u201d We always think that the people who agree with us are really smart. Peter saw the world the way I did, but in many cases, put it into words better. I wrote a memo called \u201cRisk\u201d in \u201906, \u201cRisk Revisited\u201d in \u201914, and then, bizarrely, one day, I found a memo from him \u2013 you mentioned he passed away in \u201909. In \u201916, I found a memo from him on my desk. My desk is a little messy and there\u2019s a lot of stuff floating around. It was a great memo entitled \u201cCan Risk be Reduced to a Number?\u201d I took a bunch of stuff from that in a redo of my memo entitled \u201cRisk Revisited Again,\u201d but I just think Bernstein is great. On the subject of risk, he said, \u201cEvery day, we walk into the unknown.\u201d And as I said, the future is a distribution of possibilities, and some days, we don\u2019t even know what the possibilities are. If I can borrow your copy of the book, I\u2019ll conclude with a quote from him because I think it\u2019s so good. If I can find it quickly, he said, \u201cThe future is not ours to know, but it helps to know that being wrong is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing in reasoning, not even bad luck in most instances. Being wrong comes with the franchise of an activity whose outcome depends on an unknown future.\u201d And I think that\u2019s a great way to think about the world we have to work in, and if you accept and inhale the unpredictability, variability, and randomness of the world, I think you\u2019re likely to do a lot better in it. Now that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t invest, even boldly. What it means is you have to assume that things are not always going to work out right away \u2013 well, of course, they\u2019re not always going to work out, but they\u2019re certainly not always going to work out right away, which means what? You have to have patience. You have to have staying power. You have to have fortitude. You have to not invest so much that if it goes against you, you\u2019re going to panic and get out. Preparing for an unknown, unpredictable, and maybe even hostile world in the short run is probably a lot smarter than assuming everything\u2019s going to go right, everything\u2019s going to go the way you expected, it\u2019s going to go that way right away, and you\u2019re not going to be tested. So I think that this is the kind of thinking that\u2026 When I read Bernstein or some of the other people I\u2019ve mentioned, I just go, \u201cOh yeah, right, sure. That gets it for me.\u201d And that\u2019s why I love his stuff so much. Tim Ferriss: Warren Buffett has mentioned how fond he is of your writing, and I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but if he sees one of your letters in his inbox, it\u2019s one of the first things he\u2019ll pick up to read. I\u2019d love to ask you about your reading. Are there three to five specific newsletters, columnists, economists, or writers who you find yourself excited to read these days? Anyone who comes to mind? Howard Marks: I think the best\u2026 I\u2019ve worked mainly in the credit area, not in the stock market. Most people invest mainly in the stock market, and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the stock market, but that\u2019s not what I do professionally. Oaktree\u2019s investing is largely in something called credit, which means fixed-income securities, bonds, notes, and loans not issued by governments. That\u2019s the definition of credit. In our world, there\u2019s a great newsletter called Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer. It\u2019s a little ironic because Grant\u2019s has nothing to do with interest rates \u2013 or, almost nothing \u2013 but it\u2019s about credit, and in particular, it exposes stupidity, and it exposes companies which seem to be \u2013 where people are not bringing enough skepticism and deals that seem unwise, and that kind of thing, and I think they do a great job. Now I think it\u2019s fair to say that it has a negative cast. In other words, they\u2019re mainly talking about things which are rated higher than they should be, which you should avoid or bet against. I don\u2019t think they talk as often about the things that are rated lower than they should be and present profit opportunities, but for credit guys like us, avoiding the losers is extremely important, and I think that\u2019s a great newsletter, not only for the content, but for the attitude and the importance of identifying misperceptions. Misperception is the key to operating in the markets. Variant perception \u2013 you understand things differently from the way everybody else understands them \u2013 is the key to success, assuming you\u2019re right. If you understand everything just the way everybody else does, clearly you can\u2019t outperform. That\u2019s the death knell for a would-be professional investor. So you have to see things differently from others \u2013 that\u2019s a necessary condition for outperformance \u2013 but you also have to see it better than others. That\u2019s necessary too. The combination of those two is what I call second-level thinking, which I\u2019ve mentioned a couple times. Tim Ferriss: You also mentioned how widely read Charlie Munger is, and certainly, in Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack, for instance, he talks quite a bit about \u2013 if I\u2019m not misremembering \u2013 evolutionary biology and is really able to pull concepts from seemingly unrelated disciplines into his power zone of investing. I\u2019ve had investors recommend certain books that are much broader than investing, such as Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant, which I found really fascinating as well. It talks about cycles, in a way. Are there any books that you\u2019ve found yourself recommending a lot or that you\u2019ve enjoyed in the last few years that are not specific to investing? Howard Marks: Not specific, yes. My reading is usually closer in than Charlie\u2019s. So an example is the book I\u2019m working on now, which is called Factfulness, and basically, it unmasks a lot of misperceptions that people have about the state of the world, and they hold these perceptions generally qualitatively, not based on data, and the author tries to substitute facts for these perceptions. He starts with a list of 13 questions describing the state of the world, and fascinatingly, he gives you the answer to one, and you have to think about the answer to the other 12. The average score on the 12 is two, and he points out that if you flip the coin, you\u2019d get six right. So the average American gets two of the 12 questions right, so not only are they systematically wrong, but they\u2019re wrong in the same direction, which is they always pick the more pessimistic answer when the more optimistic one is true, and so he responds to our bias and tries to overcome the ignorance and the bias by using facts and some great, very communicative graphics. So I would recommend Factfulness, and I love the idea of unmasking biases. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned that \u2013 and if I get this wrong as I\u2019m restating, please correct me \u2013 in a low-yield environment, to get high-yield entails increased risk. I know you\u2019ve written a little bit about cryptocurrency before. The last one I saw was from about a year ago. What is your current view on cryptocurrency? That\u2019s one place that people are going, often with no understanding of the technology or anything else. It scares me enough, although \u2013 anyway, I won\u2019t get into my view on that stuff, but people who are well outside of tech and all that are getting very bullish as it relates to cryptocurrency. What are your thoughts? Howard Marks: I am what is called a value investor, and that means you look at the situation, you don\u2019t look at the atmospherics, you don\u2019t look at the aesthetics, you look at the hard value \u2013 the company\u2019s assets and the cash flow that its business produces \u2013 and you value those things, and you come to something called the intrinsic value, and then you see if you can buy it for less. If you pay full intrinsic value, you\u2019ll probably get a fair return; if you pay more, you\u2019ll probably have an unsuccessful experience, but if you can buy it for less than the intrinsic value, you should have an above-average return. That\u2019s value investing, and I think it is the intellectually soundest form of investing, and nobody has been able to tell me the intrinsic value of a Bitcoin. I believe there are assets in this world where you can come up to intrinsic value, and they are the ones that produce cash flow: companies, stocks, bonds, buildings \u2013 that kind of thing. There are a lot of assets in this world that do not produce cash flow. You cannot put an intrinsic value on oil, gold, diamonds, paintings, or Bitcoin. Yes, it does. We cannot say how many pounds a dollar is worth. People look them in terms of what\u2019s called purchasing power parity, but it doesn\u2019t really work very well. And the truth of the matter is that these macro considerations \u2013 the directions of economies, markets, currencies, and commodity prices \u2013 what\u2019s the intrinsic value of an orange? These things I think can\u2019t be predicted reliably, and in fact, the so-called macro funds have been doing quite poorly for years. So there are some things that can be valued and some things that can\u2019t, and I believe Bitcoin is one of the things that can\u2019t be valued, and everybody says to me, \u201cBut you don\u2019t understand,\u201d and I wrote about this in my July \u201917 memo and returned to it in September. I learned something between July and September, and that\u2019s why I put it in the next memo. People said, \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand. People are going to want a currency that the government can\u2019t deflate, that can\u2019t be counterfeited, and can\u2019t be stolen,\u201d and all these things. That\u2019s why I returned to it. But I still don\u2019t understand how it can be valued. Today, a Bitcoin is $6,500 here on August tenth, and I don\u2019t see how you can say it\u2019s worth $7,500, $5,500, or anything like that. You can say it\u2019s going to be useful in the future, you can say people want a nongovernmental currency, but I don\u2019t see how you can put a value on it. With all of its attractions \u2013 to the extent that people find attractions in it \u2013 last year, it went from $1,000 to $19,000. Now I could be wrong, but that tells me it\u2019s speculative buying, and by the way, the people who \u2013 remember what I said about people who have opinions believing they\u2019re right \u2013 if it traded at $19,000, somebody thought it was a good buy at $19,000 because it was going higher, and today, it\u2019s a third of that. So for the most part, reasonably valued value investments do not go up 19 times in a year and then down by two-thirds. Tim Ferriss: Are there any \u2013 understanding that you are a value investor \u2013 you mentioned a few other names in the introduction of your book \u2013 Joel Greenblatt, who I\u2019m also a fan of \u2013 are there any growth investors or venture investors who are\u2026certainly, approaching things differently, but are there any growth or venture investors or people who are playing a slightly different approach who you have a lot of respect for or admire for particular reasons? Howard Marks: Sure. Let me say there are many ways to invest; there are many people who engage in activities that I think can\u2019t be done, and there are many people in each one who do very well. I don\u2019t say mine is the only way. Venture is an example. I\u2019m not a futurist, I\u2019m not a dreamer, and I\u2019m not highly risk-tolerant. I\u2019m not biased to risk-taking. 40 years ago, when Citibank told me they wanted to start a high-yield bond portfolio, if instead, they would have said, \u201cI want you to start a venture capital fund,\u201d I probably would have been a disaster. But, in the venture field, success seems to be recurring, not random. If 20 percent or 10 percent of venture capital funds are successful, you would think that with any given firm, 20 percent or 10 percent of their funds would be successful, but there are firms which are repeatedly successful. I was lucky in the last year to get to meet Bill Gurley of Benchmark, and Bill was nice enough to give me a blurb for the jacket of my book, and I was very impressed by our conversation and by Benchmark\u2019s record of achievement. Sequoia has a great record, as does as Kleiner Perkins, so you can do it, but it wouldn\u2019t be right for me. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not right for them. Macro \u2013 I said 15 minutes ago that macro funds have had a pretty bad record. Some of the greatest investors in history have been macro investors \u2013 George Soros and Stan Druckenmiller, for example, have been fabulous. They probably have the highest returns of everybody. Quantitative investing \u2013 Renaissance and so forth. So again, it would be a terrible form of hubris to say my way is the only way. My way is the way that works for me. By the way, if you look at the others, the success ratio is not terribly high, but certainly, there are people who\u2019ve done it well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there\u2019s a very high concentration of success in a handful, at least within venture. Yeah, Bill\u2019s a very smart guy, and all the firms you\u2019ve mentioned have done really well. So I\u2019ve heard it said \u2013 this is not from you in these words, I don\u2019t think \u2013 that the right decision at the wrong time is the wrong decision. I\u2019m very excited about the new book and the literacy of cycles that you are helping people to develop with this. We\u2019re going to wrap up in just a few questions. Are there any particular mental models or heuristics that are in this book or that you\u2019ve used in your investing life that you think are particularly valuable across the board in life? I know that\u2019s a big question and you probably have quite a few directions you could go with that, but just in terms of becoming a clearer thinker and better-operating human being, does anything come to mind that we haven\u2019t discussed so far as it relates to any type of mental model that would be worth mentioning before we wrap up? Howard Marks: Well, Tim, when I finished writing the book and I was thinking about cycles, I said to myself, \u201cSo for example, the economy grows about 2-2.5 percent a year on average. Why doesn\u2019t it just grow 2.5 percent every year? Why is it sometimes four, sometimes one, sometimes five, and sometimes negative?\u201d And the answer is excesses and their correction. People get too excited, they overexpand their businesses, they invest too much, or they invest too much using debt, and then something goes wrong, and their excesses produce booms, and then something goes wrong, and those excessive activities turn out to be unsustainable, and they are then corrected by selling off inventory, closing plants, or liquidating a leveraged portfolio, and those produce busts. So it\u2019s from excesses and their corrections, and I think the best thing that people can do is be on the lookout for those things, and when other people are engaging in excesses to the upside, we should turn cautious, and when other people are overcorrecting to the downside, we should turn aggressive. It\u2019s been a big part of what Bruce and I have accomplished for the Oaktree investors and my other partners and colleagues, and it\u2019s something that everybody can do if they turn their mind to it. Tim Ferriss: Well, Howard, I really appreciate the time today. Howard Marks: Me too. Tim Ferriss: This was very fun for me, and hopefully \u2013 and I believe it will be valuable for people listening. Just to mention a few things, of course, people can find Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side everywhere books are sold. You can also learn more at masteringthemarketcycle.com, people can learn more about Oaktree at oaktreecapital.com, and on social media, you have Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn all the same \u2013 HowardMarksBook. Is there anything else you would like to say to the people listening, any recommendation or question they should ponder, action you might ask them to take \u2013 anything at all besides the book itself, which I encourage people to check out? Howard Marks: Well, first of all, we\u2019ve made repeated reference to my memos. They\u2019re all available online at oaktreecapital.com under the heading of \u201cInsights > Chairman\u2019s Memos.\u201d You can get the last 29 years\u2019 worth. You can also sign up for a service that will notify you when one is published. The price is right because they\u2019re free, and I hope people will read them. And I just want to say that I like to hear from people. I don\u2019t always have time to answer everybody, but my writing of the memos and the books has been enormously rewarding because I get lovely memos from people which say that I made complex things seem clear. That\u2019s the one that gets me going the most. So if people want to comment, take issue, or ask a question, I\u2019ll try to get back to them. Tim Ferriss: And is the best way to reach out to send you a note on social media? I would advise against giving out any type of email address that will get deluged. Or maybe the answer is they should figure it out. Howard Marks: Well, we\u2019re on social media, and we\u2019d be glad to hear from them there. Tim Ferriss: Perfect. Well, Howard, thank you again for the time, and for everybody listening, links to everything we discussed will be in the show notes as usual at tim.blog/podcast, and until next time, thank you for listening.

"i thought that we could certainly talk about that specifically, but in the course of doing research for this conversation, i discovered that you had studied not only finance and what you might look at as vocational subjects when you were in undergrad, but it also seems like you studied japanese, and there was this concept of muj\u014d that popped up when i was doing my reading", "would you mind describing that time and that concept", "howard marks: well, i went to wharton at an enlightened time, when you were required to have a non-business minor and a semester of the literature of a foreign country \u2013 in english", "i never learned japanese, but for some reason, i started off \u2013 it\u2019s interesting that i have no recollection of what motivated me, but i decided against french or english literature in favor of japanese literature", "it must have been the exoticism", "i liked it so much that i turned japanese studies into my minor and took 15 credits at the graduate level",

\u2013 in other words, the operation of life", "the essence is impermanence because the wheel does turn", "it also means the unpredictability of the future", "these were really formative for me, and they have unconsciously informed everything i\u2019ve done", "i personally think that in the investment business \u2013 and also in life \u2013 you are better off if you realize that life is always going to change on you, there will always be new things coming down the pike, and that you can\u2019t control it", "what we have to do is live with it", "tim ferriss: in the course of the reading i\u2019ve done to prep for this, which is not only the new book, but also many of your letters of which i already was a fan but came back to revisit, i came across many people who had tried to select favorite quotes, and one that came up a lot \u2013 you can certainly correct this if it is not accurate \u2013 is something along the lines of, \u201cyou can\u2019t predict", "you can prepare.\u201d and that leads me to 2008", "i suspect we\u2019re going to bounce around chronologically quite a lot", "during the 2008 bubble, which of course was a time in which many investors were pulling out of the market, oaktree did exactly the opposite", "you put more than $500 million a week to work over 15 weeks", "why did you do that", "were you predicting", "were you prepared", "what led to that type of decision", "howard marks: sure", "well, you mentioned the memos", "i\u2019ve been writing the memos since 1990", "i wrote one about 20 years ago in the late \u201890s called, \u201cyou can\u2019t predict", "you can prepare.\u201d i stole the tagline from an ad for northwestern mutual life insurance, but i think that\u2019s true of life", "now, it sounds like an oxymoron because how can you prepare if you can\u2019t predict", "but the answer is we never know what\u2019s going to happen, but we can consider the likely scenarios and prepare for some of them", "by definition, you can\u2019t prepare for every eventuality", "but, i would say that we did have a sense \u2013 my partner bruce karsh and i had a sense in \u201905 and \u201906 that the world wasn\u2019t running right, and the main thing that made us conclude that was the crappy deals that were getting done", "he and i would spend the day walking into each other\u2019s offices saying, \u201clook at this piece of crap that got issued yesterday", "there\u2019s something wrong", "a deal like this should not be doable", "the fact that investors are buying this tells me that they\u2019re not being skeptical, they\u2019re not being demanding, they\u2019re not applying standards.\u201d buffett has a saying: \u201cthe less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own affairs,\u201d and it\u2019s absolutely true", "and so we knew that the market was dangerous because of the behavior of others", "now, you can\u2019t \u2013 so we were prepared", "we sold a lot of assets, we liquidated large funds, we replaced them with small funds, we became very selective in our buying, and we raised a very large fund for investment if a bursting crisis would come into being", "tim ferriss: was this for distressed debt", "howard marks: distressed debt", "now, the interesting thing, though \u2013 so you can prepare; you can\u2019t predict", "the thing that caused the bubble to burst was the insubstantiality of mortgage-backed securities, especially subprime", "if you read the memos, you won\u2019t find a word about it", "we didn\u2019t predict that", "we didn\u2019t even know about it", "it was occurring in an odd corner of the securities market", "most of us didn\u2019t know about it, but it is what brought the house down and we had no idea", "but we were prepared because we simply knew that we were on dangerous ground, and that required cautious preparation", "tim ferriss: let me ask \u2013 and i may embarrass myself with questions that display my ignorance about many topics in this interview, but when you raised money for a distressed debt fund, did you emphasize to the lps or whoever gave you those funds that you had a specific timeline in mind for deploying those funds, or did you emphasize the importance of patience with those people, that you\u2019d be looking for indicators, and that they needed to look at it as a long-term investment", "how did you manage the question of when from those people", "howard marks: the question of when is one of the hardest ones in our business, and i always say that we may have an idea of what\u2019s going to happen, but we never know when it\u2019s going to happen", "you can\u2019t call these things", "as one of my partners says, \u201cif you name a price, don\u2019t name a date, and if you name a date, don\u2019t name a price, and then you can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d but we never did name a date", "we probably \u2013 i can\u2019t even remember \u2013 we probably had a limit", "in other words, if we hadn\u2019t deployed it within x years, then the commitment got canceled", "but i think there was an understanding that we thought it was coming within the next one to three years", "tim ferriss: now, the subtitle of this new book \u2013 of course, the title is mastering the market cycle \u2013 is getting the odds on your side", "how does one \u2013 and of course, this is something we could discuss for many hours on end \u2013 why this book, and in this context, how does someone get the odds on their side", "howard marks: so i started writing the memos in 1990; i wrote them for 20 years", "i always concluded that i would write a book and pull them together into a philosophy when i retired, and then i got a letter from warren buffett in 2010 saying, \u201cif you write a book, i\u2019ll give you a blurb for the jacket.\u201d so that was enough to get me off my ass and get me to do it in real time", "i wrote a book called the most important thing because i found myself sitting in clients\u2019 offices saying, \u201cthe most important thing is buying cheap,\u201d and then, 10 minutes later, i would say, \u201cthe most important thing is not losing money,\u201d and then, 10 minutes later, i would say, \u201cthe most important thing is contrarian behavior.\u201d so i wrote a book called the most important thing, which has 21 chapters, and each one starts off with the title \u201cthe most important thing is\u2026\u201d and then it\u2019s a most important thing", "one of those most important things is knowing where we stand in the cycle", "as i say, i don\u2019t believe in forecasts", "we always say, \u201cwe never know where we\u2019re going, but we sure as hell ought to know where we are.\u201d i can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, but i should be able to assess the current environment, and that\u2019s the kind of thinking that helped us prepare for the crisis", "i think that the two most important things are where we stand in the cycle and the broad subject of risk, and in fact, where we stand in the cycle is the primary determinant of risk, so i think that this is a really important topic and it can really help you do better", "what getting the odds on your side means is that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 nobody can tell you \u2013 but there are times when the outlook for the future is better and there are times when it\u2019s worse, and it\u2019s largely determined by where we stand in the cycle", "when we are low in the cycle \u2013 that is to say, we\u2019re coming off a bust \u2013 the economy is starting to warm up", "investors are just barely starting to switch from pessimism to optimism and prices are starting to rise", "clearly, the odds are in your favor", "the outlook is better", "it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to make money, but the chances are good", "on the other hand, when the upcycle has gone on for a long time, when valuations are high, when optimism is rampant, when everybody thinks everything\u2019s going to get better forever, when the economy has been moving ahead for 10 years and it looks like it\u2019s never going to stop, then usually, the enthusiasm has carried the prices to such a high level that the odds are against you", "just knowing that is a huge advantage in investing", "you should know that when we\u2019re low in the upcycle, that\u2019s a time to be aggressive, put a lot of money to work, and buy more aggressive things, and when the cycle has gone on for a long time and we\u2019re elevated, that\u2019s the time to take some money off the table and behave more cautiously", "tim ferriss: question about 2008 \u2013 or you could pick another period or bust cycle that you\u2019re familiar with, whether from firsthand experience or research that you\u2019ve done", "you raised these funds, and i want to revisit the question of when", "from a personal standpoint \u2013 and i\u2019ll admit it very freely \u2013 i think i\u2019ve had a very fear-based mentality when it comes to public markets", "i\u2019ve done reasonably well in privately held technology startups because i lived in the middle of the switchbox in san francisco and that\u2019s the only thing i paid attention to, and it protected me, in a way, from my lesser behaviors because i wasn\u2019t allowed to sell", "but in the public markets, i\u2019ve almost always held on to cash, waiting for some cataclysmic event, but then lost my nerve in some fashion", "i\u2019d love to hear \u2013 and maybe catching the falling knives is a way to segue into this; i don\u2019t know, but i found that very interesting to read about, but how do you think about sitting on a position like that and timing", "what determines the \u201cgo\u201d command for deploying", "howard marks: you have really touched on an extremely important topic", "most of us have an inherent bias", "most of us are essentially cautious or essentially aggressive", "probably, more people are essentially cautious than aggressive", "so one of the most important things is to assess ourselves, understand our biases, and try to overcome them", "now the tim ferriss that i heard you describe \u2013 i take that to mean that maybe you were lucky or smart enough to turn cautious leading up to the bubble, the markets fell apart, you\u2019re sitting on cash, you patted yourself on the back for being so smart as to not get caught, and you watched", "what you didn\u2019t do is turn aggressive at the bottom", "tim ferriss: that\u2019s right", "howard marks: and it\u2019s common not to do so", "it\u2019s common to \u2013 as you say \u2013 for people to say, \u201ci\u2019m not going to jump in while this thing is collapsing down", "i\u2019m going to wait until the dust has settled and the future is clear", "i\u2019m not going to try to catch a falling knife.\u201d but it is when the knives are falling that the people are most terrified that the best bargains are available", "so if you wait until the dust settles, the bargains are gone, and that\u2019s what happened at the end of \u201908", "you mentioned that in distressed debt, we put $500 million a week to work in the last 15 weeks following the bankruptcy of lehman brothers, and across the firm, something like $650 million a week for 15 weeks \u2013 that\u2019s $10 billion", "but, the key is that it was at a time when essentially nobody else would", "we got great bargains", "by the time the end of \u201908 rolled around, the hedge funds that were getting withdrawals had either satisfied their withdrawals or gated, and \u2013 tim ferriss: what does \u201cgated\u201d mean", "howard marks: told clients they couldn\u2019t have their money back for a while", "and so the selling abated", "a few people saw the great values, and with the selling \u2013 and thus, the fear \u2013 having reduced, they were able to come forward, and prices started to move up", "then, it was too late", "if you\u2019re trying to buy in a falling market, you can buy all you want at successively lower prices, but if you\u2019re trying to buy large amounts in a rising market, your own buying puts the price up", "you\u2019re your own worst enemy", "you can\u2019t get much at low prices", "so one of the keys to successful investing is to either be unemotional or, at minimum, act like you are", "the great investors i know behave in an unemotional fashion", "warren buffett couldn\u2019t care less, david tepper couldn\u2019t care less, and so forth", "my own partner bruce karsh is very stalwart", "but part of it is that we support each other at the bottom", "it\u2019s not easy", "i say in the book \u2013 i recount some of the things we\u2019ve done right with regard to cycled extremes, but i absolutely don\u2019t want to give the impression that it\u2019s easy", "it\u2019s terrifying", "others are terrified", "that\u2019s why they\u2019re selling", "that\u2019s why they\u2019re saying, \u201ci don\u2019t care what the price is, just get me out.\u201d that\u2019s when you want to buy", "but the things that terrify them into selling will also terrify you", "you have to overcome it", "tim ferriss: how much of that stoic resilience or stoic composure is nature versus nurture \u2013 born versus trained \u2013 from what you\u2019ve observed and experienced", "and if a portion of it is trained, how would you suggest to someone that they develop that ability", "howard marks: i don\u2019t want to answer categorically", "i think it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier if you\u2019re born that way", "to teach yourself to be unemotional is to counter human nature, and by definition, it can\u2019t be easy", "other than where we are in the cycle and what\u2019s going to happen in the next six months, this is probably the question i get the most often", "how can you teach yourself to be unemotional, to be contrarian, to be a second-level thinker", "there is no easy answer", "in the first book, on the subject of what i call second-level thinking, i say, \u201cthey say you can\u2019t coach height", "all the coaching in the world will not make your team taller.\u201d so i don\u2019t know, frankly, whether people can teach themselves to be unemotional, but clearly, if you are as emotional as others, you will probably succumb to the same errors", "tim ferriss: so let\u2019s \u2013 i\u2019d love to back into this type of\u2026not psychological profiling, but an examination of this type of resilience, maybe indirectly \u2013 maybe it\u2019ll come up, maybe it won\u2019t \u2013 and i might get the total duration incorrect, but you mentioned a name, bruce karsh, that i\u2019d love to bring up yet again", "he may come up repeatedly", "you\u2019ve had a 23-year partnership, is that right", "howard marks: 31", "oaktree is 23 years old, but we worked together for eight years before that", "tim ferriss: prior to that, all right", "so if you were trying to hire a 25-year-old version of bruce, what would you be looking for", "howard marks: well, i\u2019ll tell you what he is", "he\u2019s super smart", "that goes without saying", "he is highly competitive", "he\u2019s a chess player", "again, most of the people i know who are good investors are game players \u2013 either backgammon, chess, or something like that", "we are inherently competitive", "he\u2019s also very analytical, and he\u2019s kind of a grinder, and i would describe myself as being intuitive and a quick decider \u2013 thinking slow and fast, kahneman", "i\u2019m a fast thinker", "you tell me a problem, i tell you my answer in short order and i\u2019m done with it, for the most part", "bruce will think about it longer, come to his conclusion, and then he\u2019ll come back the next day and say, \u201cyou know, i was thinking about it last night", "i don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, and here\u2019s why.\u201d or, \u201ci don\u2019t think you were right, and here\u2019s why.\u201d and he\u2019ll grind on it for hours and days", "i think this is part of the secret to our success", "again, something i once wrote on the subject of a good partnership was \u201cshared values and complementary skills.\u201d if you have a partner that has different values than you do \u2013 for example, bob wants to make the most money possible and ed wants to operate with integrity", "those are largely contradictory", "so i think it\u2019s very important to share values, but i also think it\u2019s important to not be the same person, a copy of yourself", "if it\u2019s a copy of yourself, you don\u2019t need it", "the person should bring skills that you don\u2019t bring and maybe operate in ways you don\u2019t, and i think it\u2019s probably helpful that i\u2019m intuitive and he\u2019s analytical", "tim ferriss: i\u2019ve heard \u2013 well, \u201cheard\u201d is not the right verb \u2013 i\u2019ve read\u2026i believe it was buffett who said that charlie munger has something along the lines of the best 60-second mind he\u2019s ever encountered", "it sounds like you also have a very highly developed fast thinking capacity", "how is it similar or different from charlie munger\u2019s 60-second mind", "howard marks: well, first of all, it\u2019s a daunting comparison", "i would never put myself in a category with charlie", "he\u2019s brilliant, and one of the best thinkers there is", "but the main thing is that he has read more broadly", "he\u2019s had another 22 years to read further, and he was probably always a broader reader than i was, and so it\u2019s his ability to call on these references", "in a way, it\u2019s kind of silly to think that we can reinvent all the wisdom in the world", "it\u2019s great to borrow from others, and charlie does that broadly, and i try to do it, but he just knows more", "tim ferriss: i think we\u2019ll almost certainly come back to warren and charlie more in this conversation, but i want to return to bruce because you mentioned the complementary skill sets, and of course, you\u2019ve written about him and mentioned him quite a bit, and i want to quickly pull up a few lines in the new book", "\u201cbruce and i had exchanged ideas and backed each other up almost daily over that period\u201d \u2013 this is the preceding text \u2013 \u201cand my give and take with him, especially in the most difficult of times, has played a particularly indispensable part in the development of the approaches to cycles on which this book is based.\u201d could you share an example of a back-and-forth or disagreement during a difficult time or with a particular decision", "is that possible, just so we have a real-world example of the interplay between the two of you", "howard marks: we normally don\u2019t debate individual investments because he operates more at that level and i operate more at the big-picture level within oaktree, but i think a good example is in the period we\u2019ve been talking about a couple of time \u2013 we mentioned the last 15 weeks of \u201908 \u2013 it was a very tough period because lehman brothers had gone bankrupt, bear stearns had disappeared, and merrill lynch had been absorbed by bank of america, washington mutual, and wachovia bank", "it looked like falling dominoes, and people were talking about the fact that it looked like morgan stanley was next and goldman was right behind that", "so you just had to conclude that the financial world was either going to end, or it wasn\u2019t", "you couldn\u2019t analyze it, you couldn\u2019t prove anything about the future, and so it required an almost gamesman-like approach to whether you buy or not, and we would talk about that in that sense, and we were both very comfortable talking about it in that sense", "what we concluded was that if the world ended, it didn\u2019t matter what we did, but if the world didn\u2019t end and we hadn\u2019t bought, we hadn\u2019t done our job", "so buck up and do your job", "now, the great thing is that half the days, bruce would come to me \u2013 because he would be lying in bed at night, thinking about this stuff \u2013 and say, \u201cyou know what", "i think we\u2019re going too fast", "i think we should slow down.\u201d and half the days, he would say, \u201ci think we\u2019re going too slow.\u201d so i would play devil\u2019s advocate and support his decision, but try to show him the other side, and he would do that with me", "that\u2019s why we got it done", "but, as i say in the introduction to the book from which you read, i don\u2019t think either of us could have done as good a job alone", "i think the devil\u2019s advocacy\u2013 but in a supportive way \u2013 really held the key", "in one of my memos, i wrote about a reporter who called me up a few days after the bankruptcy of lehman and said, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d i said, \u201cwe\u2019re buying.\u201d he said, \u201cyou are?\u201d like it was the craziest thing he\u2019d ever heard", "my reaction was, \u201cif we\u2019re not buying now, when will we?\u201d but it\u2019s been a great partnership \u2013 as you say, 31 years \u2013 never an argument", "tim ferriss: never an argument", "howard marks: never an argument", "intellectual disagreements, but never an emotional argument, and the key is respect", "even when we disagree, we respect", "the great thing about that is you sit down, you disagree, maybe you don\u2019t come to a conclusion, and then you go back to your corners, and he says, \u201cwell, you know what", "maybe howard\u2019s right.\u201d i say, \u201cmaybe bruce is right,\u201d and then you can have a productive discussion", "if your reaction is, \u201cthat moron,\u201d then you can\u2019t benefit from what he has to say", "tim ferriss: for people who are hoping to exhibit that type of poise and respect for someone else, are there any tactical recommendations you might have", "and the reason i ask that is \u2013 i no longer live in silicon valley, but i did for 17 years, and you see cofounder splits all the time", "some of them go the distance, but a lot of them end up as fatalities, and you can almost see the writing on the wall when the respect goes out the window, and it\u2019s just a matter of time for a lot of these guys", "for people who are in partnership \u2013 for the time being, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s in a business capacity or an investing capacity \u2013 what are some of the tools of the trade that don\u2019t let it escalate", "do you walk out of the room if you\u2019re starting to get heated or do you avoid, in a systemic way, given the policies of the firm, any type of mission-critical decisions that become the object of an argument, if that makes any sense", "when the stakes are high, what are some recommendations you would have when, perhaps, emotions are starting to escalate", "howard marks: the only issue i would take, tim, is that you started with assuming you\u2019re in a partnership", "i think you have to start sooner", "with whom do you get in a partnership", "you have to share values, and you shouldn\u2019t be partners with somebody you\u2019re not going to like, enjoy spending time with, and be able to work with constructively when the stuff hits the fan", "that\u2019s really the key", "so i believe that solving most personnel or managerial problems starts at the beginning with the hiring decision or the combination decision", "so just don\u2019t get into business with somebody you\u2019re not going to be able to live with", "it\u2019s kind of like a marriage", "tim ferriss: do you stress-test their ability to handle potential high-stress situations in some real or simulated fashion", "in, say, hiring decisions, do you look back at their history and reference checks to assess that", "how do you assess whether someone is going to keep their cool or not", "howard marks: well, we don\u2019t do simulations or wargames, but we do \u2013 that\u2019s an important part of reference checking", "you have to look beyond whether the person is smart and a moneymaker", "we have a \u201cno assholes\u201d rule at oaktree, and i think that solves a lot of problems", "there are lots of people in the world who can make you a lot of money, but you may not want to be in business with them, and it may not be viable long-term", "now, it\u2019s hard to absolutely follow that rule because really smart moneymakers are very tempting, but i think it\u2019s really important", "but then, once you are in business together and you have the inevitable disagreement, i think one of the most important things is to first acknowledge the limits on what you know", "if you go in with some humility, then you\u2019re unlikely to have a fight to death \u2013 that is, to the death of your partnership \u2013 over an issue", "it\u2019s great to say \u2013 people should wake up in the morning and start the day by practicing, \u201ci don\u2019t know", "i don\u2019t know.\u201d it\u2019s a great thing to say, and not enough people say it", "the flip side of \u201ci don\u2019t know\u201d is what i said before about our discussions", "\u201cmaybe he\u2019s right.\u201d and so i think that\u2019s important \u2013 humility", "number two: again, a control of emotion", "don\u2019t get into fights just to show who\u2019s more manly or equate winning the argument with success because if you\u2019re in a business situation and you\u2019re fighting for something that ultimately proves out to be a mistake, your success in winning the argument will lead to a failure", "so don\u2019t confuse winning the argument with coming to the best decision", "again, try to limit the testosterone", "i think that really gets in the way", "tim ferriss: one of the many things that i really enjoy about your writing is that it serves \u2013 for me, at least \u2013 as a reflection on clear thinking that transcends investing", "it applies to, if not all, so many areas of life \u2013 at least, those governed by the prefrontal cortex \u2013 and one that caught my eye while i was reading, which is page 15 in the new book, is the following", "i\u2019d just like to read it", "it\u2019s not very long", "\u201cin addition to an opinion regarding what\u2019s going to happen, people should have a view on the likelihood that their opinion will prove correct", "\u201csome events can be predicted with substantial confidence \u2013 example given: will a given investment-grade bond pay the interest it promises \u2013 some are uncertain \u2013 example: will amazon still be the leader in online retailing in 10 years", "\u2013 and some are entirely unpredictable \u2013 example: will the stock market go up or down next month", "it\u2019s my point here that not all predictions should be treated as equally likely to be correct, and thus, they shouldn\u2019t be relied on equally", "i don\u2019t think most people are as aware of this as they should be.\u201d could you expand on this a bit, if that\u2019s possible, and maybe give some examples of how you or other people you respect use that type of heuristic when making decisions \u2013 or, i suppose, just reflecting reality in their own minds or perceiving things howard marks: sure", "we all have opinions, and we hold our opinions because we believe in them", "nobody ever says, \u201cmy opinion is x, and i think i\u2019m wrong.\u201d we all think that our opinions are correct", "and again, the world becomes a better place \u2013 an easier place to navigate if we admit that even though there are opinions, they may be wrong", "how does an investor like me deal with the fact that he doesn\u2019t believe in future predictions", "the answer is i say \u2013 and i have opinions on other subjects \u2013 but i say it\u2019s one thing to have an opinion and it\u2019s another to believe and act as if it\u2019s right", "if you just say, \u201cmaybe i\u2019m wrong,\u201d the world gets easier, in my opinion \u2013 easier to succeed, less easy to navigate day to day", "and a big theme of the book is that we have to view the future not as an event which is predetermined and predictable or determined already, but as a range of possibilities, as a probability distribution", "i went to the world\u2019s fair in flushing in 1964, i think it was, and i stood before an exhibit that ibm had, and typically of technology 50 years ago, it was the most simplistic thing you could imagine", "they had a slot at the top and a bunch of balls, and the balls came through the slot, and there were a bunch of pegs in the grid", "when the balls hit the pegs, they started to fuse, and by the time they got to the bottom, they were in a bell-shaped distribution", "i think that was probably my first exposure to a distribution, but it\u2019s beautiful, and that\u2019s how life is", "the future is a distribution of possibilities, and if we\u2019re really smart, we know what the possibilities are, and we may have an idea of which are more likely and less likely, but we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, and i think we have to behave that way", "now, some things we know more, some things we know less", "we shouldn\u2019t get confused", "but the most important single thing is to not have the same degree of conviction about all of our opinions", "tim ferriss: do you apply a one-to-10 numerical value", "is it more of a light-medium-strong", "how do you think about that yourself", "howard marks: well, i think it\u2019s certainly not \u2013 for the most part, i\u2019m not a quantifier", "if you read the book, i would hope you would be struck by how few numbers there are in it", "one of the great quotes which is broadly attributed to einstein \u2013 i don\u2019t think it was einstein \u2013 is \u201cnot everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted.\u201d so the most important insights to life are non-quantitative, but when i have an opinion, i try to be conscious of how likely it is to be correct, and i try really hard not to always assume that i\u2019m right", "by the way, let me add one thing", "henry kaufman, who was the chief economist of salomon brothers in the \u201870s at a time when america was riven with hyperinflations \u2013 15%, 16%, 17% a year \u2013 nobody could figure out how to stop it, and the world was really a very difficult place to live", "there were two guys, kaufman and al wojnilower, at first boston, who were called \u201cdr", "gloom\u201d and \u201cdr", "doom.\u201d but kaufman said two kinds of people lose a lot of money: the people who know nothing and the people who know everything", "very few of us know nothing, but it\u2019s really important not to assume we know everything", "tim ferriss: is there any reading you\u2019ve done \u2013 or, maybe it\u2019s just real-life experience in the trenches of doing this day in and day out \u2013 but for people who want to develop that \u2013 i saw that you\u2019re what seems like a reader or fan of some of what nassim taleb has put out, and he talks about epistemological arrogance quite a bit, the belief that we know it all or more than we actually know", "how would you suggest \u2013 are there any resources, letters, books, memos, or talks that you might recommend to people who want to really cultivate that awareness of limited knowledge", "howard marks: well, when you started to ask that question, i did fast-forward to nassim nicholas taleb and his book fooled by randomness", "i think it\u2019s a really important book in terms of its ideas", "it\u2019s really about how much randomness there is in our world", "now it\u2019s primarily about the world of investing, not the general world", "his example is that if you\u2019re a dentist \u2013 he picks on dentists a lot in the book \u2013 tim ferriss: he picks on economists, too", "howard marks: yes \u2013 and you always fill a tooth the same way, you always get a successful filling, whereas in the investment business, there\u2019s nothing you can do the same every time that will always get a successful outcome because of the changeability and randomness in the world", "this is extremely important", "we have to think about the world as a probability distribution", "one of the things that interests me most is when you look at history, you say, \u201cwell, i don\u2019t know so much about the future, but history \u2013 that\u2019s done", "that\u2019s settled", "we know what happened", "we know what the truth was.\u201d but, taleb uses a concept called \u201calternative histories,\u201d the other things that reasonably, probably could have happened, but didn\u2019t", "when you look at a historical event, you have to ask yourself if that outcome was inevitable, in which case it demonstrates a truth, or if it was subject to randomness and other things could have happened just as well", "in a memo around \u201906, i talked about the rose bowl game between usc and the university of texas, and usc was highly touted as the best team in the history of college football, and \u2013 i\u2019m not going to go through all of it; i hope readers will take a look at it \u2013 but in the end, they lost on one play, so nobody talked about them as being the best football team in history", "my point was \u2013 and i entitled this section \u201cwhat\u2019s real\u201d \u2013 maybe they were the best team in history, and maybe the fact that they weren\u2019t successful on that one play that the whole game depended on was because the wind was blowing left to right or right to left at that moment", "and so we should not be too firm in our conclusions", "i guess the recurrent theme is a lack of certainty", "but i really would push people to fooled by randomness", "there\u2019s a little book by john kenneth galbraith called the short history of financial euphoria that has a great quote", "he said, \u201cwe have two kinds of forecasters: the ones who don\u2019t know and the ones who don\u2019t know they don\u2019t know.\u201d that has been very inspirational for me", "tim ferriss: i was \u2013 i don\u2019t think this was attributed to you, but i came across it while looking at some highlights of your memos in prep for this conversation", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s attributed to you, but someone said, \u201cdumb money can become smart money if it accepts its limitations.\u201d i don\u2019t know if you would agree with that, but it stuck with me as maybe \u2013 not necessarily forecasters, but at least, people who cultivate becoming aware of what they don\u2019t know", "howard marks: sure", "well, i think \u2013 first of all, knowing what you don\u2019t know is one of the keys to success in anything", "dirty harry said a man should know his limitations", "i wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 it\u2019s not my quote", "i wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that dumb money can become smart money, but i would say that one of the ways to avoid being dumb money is to not act as if you know things you don\u2019t know", "maybe by the time i get done giving the quote, i\u2019ll be able to remember who said it, but somebody very wise said \u2013 mark twain, that\u2019s it \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not what you don\u2019t know that gets you into trouble", "it\u2019s

right.\u201d it makes me think of some of these memento mori-type quotes that may be apocryphal from ancient rome, where they have someone behind the emperor when he\u2019s being paraded through the streets saying, \u201cyou\u2019re just a man, you\u2019re just a man,\u201d something like that", "i know this is seemingly maybe not on the same topic, but nonetheless, i want to ask about it", "do you have any particular routines or habits in the first hour or two of your day \u2013 whether it\u2019s now or whether you were \u2013 if there was a particularly productive period in your professional life where you feel like those routines or habits were important, does anything come to mind", "howard marks: i don\u2019t have stylized routines", "i would just say that my life is pretty calm, and i try to keep it that way", "tim ferriss: what would be a symptom of it not being calm, and how would you respond to that", "howard marks: well, watching too much political tv and getting exercised about what you see on tv would be a good example", "that\u2019s negative energy", "that\u2019s not going to contribute to your effectiveness in the day", "now, the fact that i don\u2019t get exercised about what i see on the news shows is not purposeful", "tim ferriss: so up to this point, we\u2019ve talked a fair amount about the importance of avoiding hubris, of understanding your limitations, and the incompleteness of your knowledge", "how do you balance that with knowing your strengths well enough or having conviction in evidence to the extent that you can then take action", "howard marks: sure", "that\u2019s a great question, tim", "clearly, it\u2019s essential to balance", "you don\u2019t want to be the person who thinks he knows everything, but you can\u2019t be very successful in life \u2013 especially not investing \u2013 if you think you\u2019re the person who knows nothing", "there is no magic in it", "there\u2019s no rule, no method", "it\u2019s just an awareness", "but we have to feel we know enough to take action", "now, most successful people \u2013 most smart people \u2013 don\u2019t have a problem in that area", "they have a history of having their ideas validated for the most part, but it is one of the great conundrums which is methodologically unanswerable", "you buy a stock at $80 and it falls to $60", "you say, \u201cwell, i think it\u2019s cheaper now", "i like it more", "i\u2019m going to buy more.\u201d you buy more, and then it falls to $40", "is there a point at which you say, \u201cwell, maybe i\u2019m wrong and maybe the market is right?\u201d if you throw in the towel and sell every stock you buy when it goes down a little, you can never be successful, but if you ignore the possibility that you\u2019re wrong, you can never be successful, and you have to strike a balance", "so when you buy a stock and it goes down a little, you take another look at your analysis", "was there anything you missed", "did your analysis hold water", "maybe you talk to some people that you respect to get their opinions", "but again, if you\u2019re too sure, you\u2019re in trouble, and if you\u2019re too unsure, you\u2019re in trouble", "you have to strike a balance", "tim ferriss: if we come back to the hypothetical example you gave \u2013 someone buying at $60, then it drops to $40, then to $30, then to $20 \u2013 to avoid being in that position where you are offering yourself the option of buying or selling at each of those check-in points, what do you decide in advance so that you don\u2019t make those interim mistakes or you don\u2019t even make those decisions or look at them to begin with", "howard marks: that\u2019s not my approach or oaktree\u2019s approach", "we don\u2019t have pre-set rules", "everybody says, \u201cwell, why don\u2019t you just set a role?\u201d there are things called stop-loss orders", "you buy something, it goes down 20 percent, and you

reduced to a rule", "the market operates so as to confound rule-makers", "i wrote a memo five years ago called \u201cit\u2019s not easy.\u201d it all comes down to judgment", "if we\u2019re going to have superior investment performance, we have to have superior judgment", "you can work on your processes both intellectually and emotionally, but you can\u2019t\u2026 superior judgment isn\u2019t something you can order up, and not everybody can necessarily attain it, but i think one of the most important things is to dismiss the concept of a process or rule that always works in the absence of superior judgment", "tim ferriss: is the judgment the decision to take a certain path versus another", "in other words \u2013 i know i\u2019m going to be bastardizing this \u2013 if an advantage could take the form of access to better information and better analysis of that information, making a better decision with that information that is available, having the courage to act on it and the emotional fortitude to either act on it or sit with that decision \u2013 there may be other behavioral or psychological advantages or disadvantages, and i\u2019m sure there are", "when you talk about judgment, is that a particular link in that chain", "howard marks: i think judgment is everything", "for example, just to follow your taxonomy, judgment is knowing when you have information that others don\u2019t, and if you think you know something that others don\u2019t, it\u2019s knowing when yours is likely to be valid and knowing whether you\u2019re likely to be offbeat", "it\u2019s understanding how to analyze it", "judgment is the reaching of conclusions based on your analysis, and judgment is all we have to tell us when something goes against us, whether we should hang in or give up", "so as i say, i think it\u2019s all judgment", "tim ferriss: i would imagine a lot of people read your memos and your writing in hopes of developing better judgment, and that while there is no one rule that will work for all circumstances and all cases, there may be certain questions or tools that prove helpful in a greater percentage of cases than others, and to that, i would love to refer to a few things that i have in front of me", "one is a letter that you sent to me along with the book, and toward the end of the letter, it says, \u201ci draw on my 50 years of investing experience to provide an orientation to the usual cycles of the economy, corporate profits, the availability of credit, and the securities markets, as well as some of the less ordinary ones \u2013 for example, in distressed debt, investor psychology, and even in success \u2013 but i think potentially, the most useful is the chapter on the cycle and attitudes toward risk", "how investors are thinking about risk and behaving toward it at a single point in time might be the single most influential determinant of market position in the cycle, and thus, the best indicator of how we should behave in regard to it.\u201d and i read that chapter \u2013 i believe i had the right chapter \u2013 and there\u2019s a point in this chapter that has a few lines bolded \u2013 which i really appreciate, by the way \u2013 and that is, \u201cif i could ask only one question regarding each investment i had under consideration, it would be simple: how much optimism is factored into the price?\u201d could you talk about this question and perhaps give some examples of using it or how people might use it", "howard marks: sure", "i started in the business in a summer job at citibank in the summer of \u201968, 50 years ago, and the bank was an investor in what was called the \u201cnifty 50,\u201d the 50 best and fastest-growing companies in america", "if you bought the stocks the year i showed up and held them for five years, you lost almost all your money \u2013 in the best companies in america", "then, 10 years later, i switched to the so-called \u201cjunk bond\u201d business \u2013 high-yield bonds", "now i\u2019m lending money to the worst companies in america and i\u2019m making money steadily and consistently", "so clearly, buying good things and avoiding bad things can\u2019t be the secret to success in investing", "it has to be the price you pay", "it\u2019s not what you buy, it\u2019s what you pay", "and there\u2019s no asset which is so good that it can\u2019t become overpriced", "of course, this is something that people have to bear in mind when they look at the fang stocks, and on the other hand \u2013 tim ferriss: for those who don\u2019t know, what is fang", "howard marks: facebook, amazon, netflix, google, and they throw in alphabet too", "so there is no asset which is so good that it can\u2019t be overpriced", "there are very few assets which are so bad that they can\u2019t be underpriced and thus a bargain", "so what we have to look for if we\u2019re going to be successful investors \u2013 now my school, which is called value investing, puts more emphasis than perhaps venture capital or growth investing, which largely looks for brilliant futures \u2013 but the key is paying a low price relative to something called intrinsic value", "if you pay a high price relative to the value, you\u2019re unlikely to do well and you probably have to get lucky to have a good return, but if you pay a low price relative to the intrinsic value, then the odds \u2013 like my book says \u2013 are on your side", "so we want low price to value", "how do you get low price to value", "the answer is low optimism", "there are other ways to describe it \u2013 tim ferriss: you mean looking for low overall optimism", "howard marks: right", "in short, the things that everybody feels good about are likely to be the things that are high-priced, and the things that everybody feels bad about are likely to be low-priced, so if you could find a stock where nobody thinks this company could ever have a good day, maybe there\u2019s a chance that it could produce some favorable surprises and make you a lot of money", "if there\u2019s a company like the nifty 50 back in \u201968, where everybody assumed \u2013 literally, tim \u2013 nothing bad could ever happen to these stocks, then clearly, there has to be so much optimism in the price that there can never be a favorable surprise", "we make money from favorable surprises, and if the positive conviction is so high, then by definition, there can never be a favorable surprise", "so i think this is a number one concept", "tim ferriss: i think you said the word \u201cnever\u201d in this hypothetical, exuberant enthusiasm, as someone might say", "i believe there are certain words that you dislike using and pay attention to when they come up", "howard marks: it\u2019s all part of this lack of intellectual hubris", "we should never say \u201cnever,\u201d \u201calways,\u201d \u201chas to,\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t.\u201d these expressions are far too absolute to be winners in a world beset by uncertainty and randomness", "when you use those words, you tend to get into big trouble", "tim ferriss: when assessing public sentiment \u2013 it could be really wide, let\u2019s say anyone participating in the s&p 500, or it could be narrower \u2013 but let\u2019s just say we\u2019re looking at the broadest collection of market participants, at least the s&p 500", "i was texting with a friend of mine who\u2019s a successful investor but very different stylistically than yourself, and i asked him what some investing pros use to measure how fearful or greedy \u201cthe market\u201d is", "are there go-to indices or polls", "he said people use the vix as a measure of fear", "he said some people might use something like yield on junk bonds as a measure \u2013 in other words, low yield equals complacent market", "it seems so difficult to keep track of the media as a whole, although certainly it becomes obvious at some point if it\u2019s all negative or all positive", "are there particular indicators that you like to pay attention to or your firm likes to at least keep an eye on", "howard marks: in the old book, there\u2019s a chapter that talks about the importance of taking the temperature of the market, knowing where we stand, and it includes a checklist \u2013 largely tongue-in-cheek \u2013 called the \u201cpoor man\u2019s guide to market assessment.\u201d it basically asks some simple questions", "what\u2019s going on", "if a new fund comes out, does it sell out immediately or does it struggle", "if an investor goes to a cocktail party \u2013 there you are", "tim ferriss: it\u2019s also in the new book", "howard marks: oh, it\u2019s also in the new book", "if an investor like me goes to a cocktail party, is he the center of attention that everybody wants to talk to", "well, that\u2019s probably a sign that interest in the market is high", "or is he pushed into a corner and everybody wants to talk to the athletes and the venture capital guys", "that\u2019s probably an indication that interest in my part of the market is too low, and that bargains may be available", "when you turn on the tv, is all they want to talk about the good news or the bad news", "i have some cartoons in the new book \u2013 old cartoons dredged up from my files \u2013 that demonstrate that virtually everything in the world and in the markets is subject to either a positive or negative interpretation, and if everybody is interpreting everything positively, that tells me that the spirits are too high, and perhaps ready to be dashed, and vice versa", "the greatest thing i was ever taught was back around \u201973 or \u201974", "somebody said, \u201ci\u2019m going to tell you about the three stages of the bull market", "in the first stage, just a few incredibly insightful people understand that there could be improvement", "in the second stage, most people recognize that improvement is actually taking place", "in the third stage, everybody and his brother believes that things will only get better forever.\u201d now, i think that one, this is a very accurate description of the world; two, clearly, if you buy in the first stage when only a few people understand the potential for improvement, you\u2019re going to pay a low price because there isn\u2019t much optimism in the price", "then, as you progress to the second and third stage, the unanticipated improvement takes place", "that gives the market a favorable surprise", "the stock prices or the asset prices rise in response to those favorable surprises", "but you eventually reach a point where the good news convinces people that it\u2019s going to go on forever, and when everybody believes that things will get better forever, clearly, it\u2019s likely that so much optimism is in the stock price that it\u2019s dangerous and unlikely to yield a profit", "so i think that the three stages of the bull market \u2013 and conversely, of the bear market \u2013 are really important, not as a moneymaking rule, but as something to bear in mind and watch out for", "tim ferriss: i\u2019m going to ask you a few questions that you may not like, but that my fans will kill me for if i don\u2019t ask", "first, where do you think we are at the moment", "of course it has to be time-stamped", "we\u2019re talking in august of 2018", "what has you worried", "what has you optimistic, if you\u2019re optimistic about anything", "howard marks: sure", "well, where are we", "for the last 10 years, ever since the crisis, people have been asking that question in the form of \u201cwhat inning are we in?\u201d when they asked it in late \u201908, what they really meant was, \u201chow much longer will the pain go on?\u201d now, what they\u2019re asking is, \u201chow much longer will the pleasure go on, and the bull market, and the economic recovery?\u201d i think we\u2019re in the eighth inning", "now you don\u2019t have to time-stamp it because i\u2019ve been saying this for a while and i\u2019m likely to continue to do so", "but about a year ago i came to the realization that that observation \u2013 even if accurate \u2013 is of limited use because unlike baseball, we don\u2019t know how many innings there are in a game", "this is a big distinction", "in a normal baseball game, we know there are nine innings", "if i say we\u2019re in the eighth and if i say it accurately, that means the good times are about to end", "but in economies and markets, there is no fixed duration", "so the bull market \u2013 this is the tenth year", "that\u2019s a long time", "in the economic recovery, this month, we have begun the tenth year", "the longest economic recovery in recent history is 10 years, so these observations start to tell you not that it\u2019s going to end, but that the likelihood of its continuing is declining", "the odds are not on your side", "when you\u2019re in the tenth year, the odds of having 10 more years of recovery seemingly are not good", "we don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some reason why there has never been a recovery of more than 10 years, but we have to wonder if there is", "but on the other hand, we can\u2019t be too sure", "now i believe that for many years, this economic recovery was the slowest on record", "that was probably helpful because that kept excesses from coming into existence that have to be corrected with a downturn", "you asked about the good news", "the good news is that the economy is functioning at a high level, we just had a quarter of unusually rapid growth, unemployment is declining, and our economy is the envy of the world", "stock prices \u2013 which were very high when measured by price/earnings ratio last year \u2013 are not so expensive this year because the earnings have been supercharged by the tax bill", "the projected earnings of the s&p 500 are way up this year \u2013 23 percent, i think, which is unusual \u2013 and everything else being equal, higher earnings mean a lower price/earnings ratio, so by most measures, stocks are only slightly expensive at this point in time", "so that\u2019s the good news", "the bad news is that interest rates are likely to increase, and interest rates increase the burden of debt on companies, and when bonds yield more, they offer more competition for stocks", "clearly, there are a lot of uncertainties in the macro world, in the geopolitical world, and in the political world, the greatest of which is the possibility of a trade war, which almost everybody thinks would be extremely negative, not only for the u.s", "and for the people who engage in the trade war, but for everyone", "i think that interestingly, what we\u2019ve been talking about is assessing the level of investor psychology", "i don\u2019t believe that investor psychology is terribly frothy", "the way i\u2019ve put it in the past is that people are not thinking bullish, but they\u2019re acting bullish", "a lot of people have moved into higher-risk investments in order to get the returns they want because right now, safe investments \u2013 treasuries, high-grade bonds, cash, and money markets \u2013 offer so little", "so people have been forced to move out the risk curve and take more risk, and that makes the world a riskier place for you and me", "i borrowed a phrase from my late father-in-law, who said that those people could be described as handcuff volunteers", "they\u2019re doing things not because they want to, but because they have to", "but the effect on the market is the same", "when people move to riskier actions, it makes the market riskier for everyone", "tim ferriss: so if we were to consider all of that, if you had, say, three people come to you and you had to give them some response because it\u2019s your mother-in-law, people in the family, so you have to give them some kind of response \u2013 feel free to ask some clarifying questions, but let\u2019s say someone has $100,000 to invest, $1 million to invest, and $10 million to invest", "so $100,000, $1 million, and $10 million, they make $100,000 a year, and that is going to remain stable and predictable", "let\u2019s just assume that on the income side", "they are very cautious \u2013 i think that like a lot of people, the loss aversion and pain of losing $100 hurts much more than the joy they derive from making $100 \u2013 and they have their investable funds, $100,000, $1 million, and $10 million, in cash or cash-like equivalents \u2013 some of these safe vehicles \u2013 currently, and they say, \u201choward, i don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d what are your thoughts", "howard marks: i think that one of the most important things in investing is to make people comfortable", "it\u2019s a mistake to sit there and say, \u201cyou should do this, you should do that,\u201d regardless of people\u2019s comfort level because if you violate their comfort level, if you force them into things that are too risky for them and then things go bad, they\u2019re unlikely to do the right thing", "they\u2019re more likely to panic and sell on the lows, which is the cardinal sin of investing", "so it\u2019s very important to assess people\u2019s needs and ability to withstand tough times", "clearly, the person who makes $100,000 and has $100,000 doesn\u2019t have a big margin of safety for tough times, and they should invest more conservatively", "the person with $10 million, depending on his or her psychology, probably would be willing to stomach some losses in the pursuit of big gains", "now people always overestimate in advance the equanimity with which they would greet losses", "back in 1997-1999, when the stock market and tech stocks were rocketing along, i think what a lot of people said is, \u201cmy 401(k) is doing so great; i wouldn\u2019t mind if i lost a third of my money", "it\u2019s okay.\u201d believe me, when they lost a third of their money, they weren\u2019t okay", "but my mantra for the last few years has been \u201cmove forward, but with caution.\u201d so in varying degrees to those three people, i would say, \u201cwe are investing every day, we are endeavoring to be fully invested today other than in funds that are strictly designated as standby funds for the crisis, and we are definitely taking risks, but with caution.\u201d we\u2019re a cautious firm", "we invest in risky asset classes \u2013 high-yield bonds, distressed debt, real estates, emerging market stocks and bonds, et cetera \u2013 these are risky assets, and oaktree has always taken a low-risk approach, a controlled-risk approach, to those asset classes", "so when i say \u201cwith caution,\u201d i mean with more caution than usual", "i think this is a time for more caution than usual, and that\u2019s what i would tell those people", "so i think that the outlook is not so bad and the prices are not so high that you have to practice maximum defensiveness, go to cash, and suffer a 1 percent return on cash, but i think the outlook is not so good and prices are not so low that this is a time for aggressiveness, and i wouldn\u2019t be aggressive", "i think one way that i help myself make these decisions \u2013 and it might be helpful to your listeners \u2013 is i constantly remind myself and others that as an investor, there are really two key risks that we face every day", "now, the first one is obvious and everybody knows about it", "it\u2019s the risk of losing money", "what\u2019s the second", "it\u2019s not so obvious", "it\u2019s a little more subtle", "it\u2019s the risk of missing opportunity", "when reminded of the twin risks, most people would say, \u201ci think that\u2019s right", "the truth is, i don\u2019t want to lose a lot of money, but on the other hand, i don\u2019t want to miss all the opportunities, so i\u2019m going to compromise", "i\u2019m going to balance the two", "i\u2019m going to do something in the middle.\u201d that makes sense", "other than daredevils and scaredy-cats, everybody should do something in the middle", "exactly where in the middle is debatable and should be tailored to their own psyche and financial position", "so the interesting question is \u201cwhat about today?\u201d today, should you be in your normal balance between the twin risks or should you be different", "should you be in a higher-risk position because so many things yield so little or should you be in a lower-risk position because there are so many uncertainties", "and i actually agree with the latter", "so fully invested \u2013 and being cautious does not mean being in cash \u2013 and with everything you want to do in the investment business, there are higher- and lower-risk ways to do it, and i think today is a time for the lower-risk ways", "tim ferriss: this is not the first time i\u2019ve asked a question like this, but the last time i asked the first part of that, which is about someone who makes $100,000 a year and has $100,000 to spend, i was actually at the berkshire hathaway shareholder meeting a long time ago", "it was my first and only time there, and i was so excited to be there", "it\u2019s woodstock for investor nerds", "there was so much excitement", "people were camped out front to be in line", "i was part of that, and i asked someone working there where the microphone was that was hardest to get to, and then i sprinted over there, and i was able to ask warren and charlie this question \u2013 and of course, you know them, and their responses can be very short", "i said, \u201chypothetically, if someone were making $100,000 a year and had $100,000 to deploy in some way, how would you suggest they invest that capital?\u201d it was along the lines of, \u201cinvest in the s&p 500 or a low-cost index fund in the s&p 500 and get back to work.\u201d i found that very dissatisfying, but in retrospect, certainly not the worst advice that you could give someone", "how do you \u2013 with what do you disagree with warren the most", "on what do you guys not see eye to eye", "howard marks: tim, there\u2019s a book out called the warren buffett way, and i was asked to write the foreword for the latest edition, and i wrote something called \u201cwhat makes warren buffett warren buffett?\u201d and i listed the things that characterize him: extremely high iq, unemotional, great analyst, understands what\u2019s important, looks at the things that are important and figures out their import, ignores the things that are unimportant, and on and on like that", "the last one was one of the most important: he\u2019s not afraid of getting fired", "he doesn\u2019t have to worry about the interim consequences of error", "most people do", "so his advice was to invest in an index fund", "that\u2019s fine as far as it goes, but how much", "should the person who has $100,000 put the whole thing in the stock market, and especially, should they do it today", "if they do it all today, we\u2019re confident that 20 years from now, they\u2019re going to have a lot more money and they\u2019re going to be really happy", "what about a year from now", "not everybody is financially and emotionally able to live through a decline", "so as i said, the first purpose of investing \u2013 especially for people who have more money than they need to eat \u2013 should be to make you comfortable", "when i started at citibank 50 years ago, they had a cartoon on the wall", "it said, \u201cscared money never wins,\u201d and it\u2019s true", "so everybody should invest only up to their comfort level", "i certainly agree with warren that for most people, they can improve on an index fund, and i\u2019m not saying that warren says that everybody should put 100 percent of their net worth in the index fund \u2013 clearly, they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 and i was once at a talk, and i was preceded by a college professor i won\u2019t identify \u2013 warren always says, \u201cpraise by name, criticize by category,\u201d so i\u2019ll only say i was preceded by a college professor", "this guy is known for a pro-stock attitude, and what he said was, \u201cif you are of average risk tolerance, you should have 85 percent of your money in\u201d \u2013 no", "\u201cif you have below-average risk tolerance you should have 85 percent of your money in the stock market, if you\u2019re average, 105, and if you\u2019re aggressive, 125 percent of your net worth should be in the stock market.\u201d i just think that most people can\u2019t live in the short run with the consequences of being that deeply invested", "being human, we are our own worst enemy", "everything that goes on in the world and the market conspires to make people buy when things are going well and prices are high and sell when things are going badly and prices are low, and fighting that is the number one theme of the book, and it\u2019s the number one theme of success", "tim ferriss: just from personal experience \u2013 and i mentioned this earlier \u2013 looking at my response in 2008\u2026 i bought a house in 2007 with some very unfortunate mortgage terms and made some very bad decisions with money that i had in the stock market at that time", "i think in part, it was because i couldn\u2019t have known how i would respond under those circumstances, and when i filled out these very templated forms, of course, for whoever it was at the time \u2013 i won\u2019t mention anyone by name, but it was, \u201cto what extent would you be comfortable with a drop in your portfolio over one quarter or one year?\u201d that was the form of the question, and it had 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent", "i thought, \u201cwell, 30 percent, maybe,\u201d pulling an answer out of thin air", "i had to answer it to get through the online form", "but i had never experienced anything similar to that", "this just came to mind because i\u2019m looking at a book on your shelf, bringing down the house, about games", "we were talking about games earlier", "as i understand it, bill gates and warren buffett play a fair amount of bridge", "certainly, many people in the investing world \u2013 including some people who are really fantastic, some of the guys from renaissance and so on \u2013 play poker, and then you have backgammon", "what do you play, what do you think the game that they select says about the person, if anything, and could the game they select help someone to assess their risk tolerance for larger types of investing or other ways to accurately determine that in any way", "howard marks: i think \u201caccurately determine,\u201d yes, \u201cquantify,\u201d no", "but i think that we can get a handle on our degree of risk tolerance and risk aversion, and we should", "i was with my son and one of his friends this week, and his friend is a great chess player", "the interesting thing about people who play chess is that in chess, there\u2019s no randomness", "there\u2019s no dice to roll, no wind to blow, and no card to pick from the deck", "all the information is on the board and everybody has all the information", "so it tells you something about an intellectual process", "that goes all the way out to craps, where everything is in play all the time based on randomness", "so maybe which game we like tells us something about ourselves, but how we play also tells us about ourselves", "backgammon, which is one of my main games, is highly probability-intensive because it\u2019s all the dice \u2013 it\u2019s the dice and the skill, but the dice mean a lot", "in any situation, with any throw of the dice, there are aggressive and defensive ways to play", "probably the interesting thing is if you played and i watched you for a couple hours, i would know if you were aggressive or defensive, risk-averse or risk-tolerant, and you should be able to do the same for yourself", "as i said before, one of the great things is to understand ourselves, and without that, we\u2019re really in trouble", "tim ferriss: what are some of the things that otherwise smart people miss about cycles or misconceptions that you believe to be true \u2013 like mark twain said \u2013 that just ain\u2019t so", "howard marks: i think the biggest mistake you can make is to ignore the repetitive nature of the cyclical pattern", "in his book principles, ray dalio talks about how much analysis he and his partners did, the conclusion of which is the ability to look at what\u2019s going on in the world or in the market and say, \u201coh, that\u2019s another one of those.\u201d life becomes very easy when you have studied the past to the extent that you have seen the recurring patterns and you can recognize them when they come up again", "so i think that\u2019s extremely important", "but, the other thing is \u2013 and i think the guiding quote of the book is another one from mark twain, \u201chistory does not repeat, but it does rhyme.\u201d history does not repeat", "the cycles are never the same in terms of amplitude, speed, duration, cause, or ramifications, but there are themes that repeat that can help us to identify and properly respond to cyclical occurrences", "so i say in the book that i\u2019ve been in the high-yield bond business now for 40 years, and there was a time where there arose a body of thought that most defaults occur on bonds\u2019 second anniversaries since their issuance", "i don\u2019t think there was anything magical about the second anniversary, and if people believed that, then they would sell all the bonds they had that were 23 months old and buy them back when they were 25 months old if they had survived, but i don\u2019t think they would accomplish anything by that because i think they were assigning an import to a number that was not valid", "so i think it\u2019s really important to recognize cycles and understand them, but i think it\u2019s unimportant to assign importance to these numbers or rules, but it\u2019s very important to understand what\u2019s going on around us, and when the recovery is old, the bull market is old, the psychology is elevated, the valuations are high, then you should know that the odds are not on your side, and you should take some money off the table and behave in a more cautious way, and vice versa", "tim ferriss: so i suppose also, on some level, it necessitates cultivating a fair degree of patience", "howard marks: patience is essential", "there was an investment sage named peter bernstein, and he said, \u201cthe market is not an accommodating machine that will give you high returns because you need or want them.\u201d i believe that right now, we\u2019re living in a low-return world, and if you say, \u201choward, i need high returns in a low-return world,\u201d the only way to try to get them is by taking a lot of risk, and by definition, taking a lot of risk is not sure to work and could have negative consequences", "so i believe that when you\u2019re in a low-return world, you have to accept it and deal accordingly", "now, this comes from muj\u014d, which we started the interview with", "i talked about muj\u014d in a memo about 20 years ago entitled \u201cit is what it is.\u201d i think one of the most important things we can do as adults, be it in the investment world or the real world, is to say, \u201cit is what it is\u201d \u2013 in other words, accept things for what they are, deal with them as they are, don\u2019t spend a lot of time wishing they were different, and certainly, don\u2019t act as if they were different", "we have to accept the realities", "tim ferriss: in my little tiny corner of investing, which is not even worth mentioning in this conversation, but i only bring it up to tie it to how helpful actually reading \u2013 it\u2019s not quite scripture, but buddhist thinking related to concepts like muj\u014d and stoic philosophy \u2013 epictetus and so on \u2013 how helpful that has been to tempering emotional reactivity", "you mentioned someone i want to come back to, who is peter \u2013 is it \u201cbern-steen\u201d or \u201c-stein\u201d", "howard marks: \u201cbern-steen.\u201d tim ferriss: \u201cbern-steen\u201d \u2013 a financial historian who sadly passed away in 2009, i think", "i\u2019ve read that you consider him one of the smartest people you\u2019ve ever met", "why is that", "are there any other things that you learned from him", "howard marks: 48 years ago, when i was a junior analyst following xerox for citibank and i would give the portfolio managers at the bank my opinions, one of them came up to me and said, \u201cwho is the best analyst on wall street on xerox?\u201d i said, \u201cthe one who agrees with me the most is so-and-so.\u201d we always think that the people who agree with us are really smart", "peter saw the world the way i did, but in many cases, put it into words better", "i wrote a memo called \u201crisk\u201d in \u201906, \u201crisk revisited\u201d in \u201914, and then, bizarrely, one day, i found a memo from him \u2013 you mentioned he passed away in \u201909", "in \u201916, i found a memo from him on my desk", "my desk is a little messy and there\u2019s a lot of stuff floating around", "it was a great memo entitled \u201ccan risk be reduced to a number?\u201d i took a bunch of stuff from that in a redo of my memo entitled \u201crisk revisited again,\u201d but i just think bernstein is great", "on the subject of risk, he said, \u201cevery day, we walk into the unknown.\u201d and as i said, the future is a distribution of possibilities, and some days, we don\u2019t even know what the possibilities are", "if i can borrow your copy of the book, i\u2019ll conclude with a quote from him because i think it\u2019s so good", "if i can find it quickly, he said, \u201cthe future is not ours to know, but it helps to know that being wrong is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing in reasoning, not even bad luck in most instances", "being wrong comes with the franchise of an activity whose outcome depends on an unknown future.\u201d and i think that\u2019s a great way to think about the world we have to work in, and if you accept and inhale the unpredictability, variability, and randomness of the world, i think you\u2019re likely to do a lot better in it", "now that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t invest, even boldly", "what it means is you have to assume that things are not always going to work out right away \u2013 well, of course, they\u2019re not always going to work out, but they\u2019re certainly not always going to work out right away, which means what", "you have to have patience", "you have to have staying power", "you have to have fortitude", "you have to not invest so much that if it goes against you, you\u2019re going to panic and get out", "preparing for an unknown, unpredictable, and maybe even hostile world in the short run is probably a lot smarter than assuming everything\u2019s going to go right, everything\u2019s going to go the way you expected, it\u2019s going to go that way right away, and you\u2019re not going to be tested", "so i think that this is the kind of thinking that\u2026 when i read bernstein or some of the other people i\u2019ve mentioned, i just go, \u201coh yeah, right, sure", "that gets it for me.\u201d and that\u2019s why i love his stuff so much", "tim ferriss: warren buffett has mentioned how fond he is of your writing, and i\u2019m paraphrasing here, but if he sees one of your letters in his inbox, it\u2019s one of the first things he\u2019ll pick up to read", "i\u2019d love to ask you about your reading", "are there three to five specific newsletters, columnists, economists, or writers who you find yourself excited to read these days", "anyone who comes to mind", "howard marks: i think the best\u2026 i\u2019ve worked mainly in the credit area, not in the stock market", "most people invest mainly in the stock market, and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the stock market, but that\u2019s not what i do professionally", "oaktree\u2019s investing is largely in something called credit, which means fixed-income securities, bonds, notes, and loans not issued by governments", "that\u2019s the definition of credit", "in our world, there\u2019s a great newsletter called grant\u2019s interest rate observer", "it\u2019s a little ironic because grant\u2019s has nothing to do with interest rates \u2013 or, almost nothing \u2013 but it\u2019s about credit, and in particular, it exposes stupidity, and it exposes companies which seem to be \u2013 where people are not bringing enough skepticism and deals that seem unwise, and that kind of thing, and i think they do a great job", "now i think it\u2019s fair to say that it has a negative cast", "in other words, they\u2019re mainly talking about things which are rated higher than they should be, which you should avoid or bet against", "i don\u2019t think they talk as often about the things that are rated lower than they should be and present profit opportunities, but for credit guys like us, avoiding the losers is extremely important, and i think that\u2019s a great newsletter, not only for the content, but for the attitude and the importance of identifying misperceptions", "misperception is the key to operating in the markets", "variant perception \u2013 you understand things differently from the way everybody else understands them \u2013 is the key to success, assuming you\u2019re right", "if you understand everything just the way everybody else does, clearly you can\u2019t outperform", "that\u2019s the death knell for a would-be professional investor", "so you have to see things differently from others \u2013 that\u2019s a necessary condition for outperformance \u2013 but you also have to see it better than others", "that\u2019s necessary too", "the combination of those two is what i call second-level thinking, which i\u2019ve mentioned a couple times", "tim ferriss: you also mentioned how widely read charlie munger is, and certainly, in poor charlie\u2019s almanack, for instance, he talks quite a bit about \u2013 if i\u2019m not misremembering \u2013 evolutionary biology and is really able to pull concepts from seemingly unrelated disciplines into his power zone of investing", "i\u2019ve had investors recommend certain books that are much broader than investing, such as lessons of history by will and ariel durant, which i found really fascinating as well", "it talks about cycles, in a way", "are there any books that you\u2019ve found yourself recommending a lot or that you\u2019ve enjoyed in the last few years that are not specific to investing", "howard marks: not specific, yes", "my reading is usually closer in than charlie\u2019s", "so an example is the book i\u2019m working on now, which is called factfulness, and basically, it unmasks a lot of misperceptions that people have about the state of the world, and they hold these perceptions generally qualitatively, not based on data, and the author tries to substitute facts for these perceptions", "he starts with a list of 13 questions describing the state of the world, and fascinatingly, he gives you the answer to one, and you have to think about the answer to the other 12", "the average score on the 12 is two, and he points out that if you flip the coin, you\u2019d get six right", "so the average american gets two of the 12 questions right, so not only are they systematically wrong, but they\u2019re wrong in the same direction, which is they always pick the more pessimistic answer when the more optimistic one is true, and so he responds to our bias and tries to overcome the ignorance and the bias by using facts and some great, very communicative graphics", "so i would recommend factfulness, and i love the idea of unmasking biases", "tim ferriss: you mentioned that \u2013 and if i get this wrong as i\u2019m restating, please correct me \u2013 in a low-yield environment, to get high-yield entails increased risk", "i know you\u2019ve written a little bit about cryptocurrency before", "the last one i saw was from about a year ago", "what is your current view on cryptocurrency", "that\u2019s one place that people are going, often with no understanding of the technology or anything else", "it scares me enough, although \u2013 anyway, i won\u2019t get into my view on that stuff, but people who are well outside of tech and all that are getting very bullish as it relates to cryptocurrency", "what are your thoughts", "howard marks: i am what is called a value investor, and that means you look at the situation, you don\u2019t look at the atmospherics, you don\u2019t look at the aesthetics, you look at the hard value \u2013 the company\u2019s assets and the cash flow that its business produces \u2013 and you value those things, and you come to something called the intrinsic value, and then you see if you can buy it for less", "if you pay full intrinsic value, you\u2019ll probably get a fair return; if you pay more, you\u2019ll probably have an unsuccessful experience, but if you can buy it for less than the intrinsic value, you should have an above-average return", "that\u2019s value investing, and i think it is the intellectually soundest form of investing, and nobody has been able to tell me the intrinsic value of a bitcoin", "i believe there are assets in this world where you can come up to intrinsic value, and they are the ones that produce cash flow: companies, stocks, bonds, buildings \u2013 that kind of thing", "there are a lot of assets in this world that do not produce cash flow", "you cannot put an intrinsic value on oil, gold, diamonds, paintings, or bitcoin", "yes, it does", "we cannot say how many pounds a dollar is worth", "people look them in terms of what\u2019s called purchasing power parity, but it doesn\u2019t really work very well", "and the truth of the matter is that these macro considerations \u2013 the directions of economies, markets, currencies, and commodity prices \u2013 what\u2019s the intrinsic value of an orange", "these things i think can\u2019t be predicted reliably, and in fact, the so-called macro funds have been doing quite poorly for years", "so there are some things that can be valued and some things that can\u2019t, and i believe bitcoin is one of the things that can\u2019t be valued, and everybody says to me, \u201cbut you don\u2019t understand,\u201d and i wrote about this in my july \u201917 memo and returned to it in september", "i learned something between july and september, and that\u2019s why i put it in the next memo", "people said, \u201cyou just don\u2019t understand", "people are going to want a currency that the government can\u2019t deflate, that can\u2019t be counterfeited, and can\u2019t be stolen,\u201d and all these things", "that\u2019s why i returned to it", "but i still don\u2019t understand how it can be valued", "today, a bitcoin is $6,500 here on august tenth, and i don\u2019t see how you can say it\u2019s worth $7,500, $5,500, or anything like that", "you can say it\u2019s going to be useful in the future, you can say people want a nongovernmental currency, but i don\u2019t see how you can put a value on it", "with all of its attractions \u2013 to the extent that people find attractions in it \u2013 last year, it went from $1,000 to $19,000", "now i could be wrong, but that tells me it\u2019s speculative buying, and by the way, the people who \u2013 remember what i said about people who have opinions believing they\u2019re right \u2013 if it traded at $19,000, somebody thought it was a good buy at $19,000 because it was going higher, and today, it\u2019s a third of that", "so for the most part, reasonably valued value investments do not go up 19 times in a year and then down by two-thirds", "tim ferriss: are there any \u2013 understanding that you are a value investor \u2013 you mentioned a few other names in the introduction of your book \u2013 joel greenblatt, who i\u2019m also a fan of \u2013 are there any growth investors or venture investors who are\u2026certainly, approaching things differently, but are there any growth or venture investors or people who are playing a slightly different approach who you have a lot of respect for or admire for particular reasons", "howard marks: sure", "let me say there are many ways to invest; there are many people who engage in activities that i think can\u2019t be done, and there are many people in each one who do very well", "i don\u2019t say mine is the only way", "venture is an example", "i\u2019m not a futurist, i\u2019m not a dreamer, and i\u2019m not highly risk-tolerant", "i\u2019m not biased to risk-taking", "40 years ago, when citibank told me they wanted to start a high-yield bond portfolio, if instead, they would have said, \u201ci want you to start a venture capital fund,\u201d i probably would have been a disaster", "but, in the venture field, success seems to be recurring, not random", "if 20 percent or 10 percent of venture capital funds are successful, you would think that with any given firm, 20 percent or 10 percent of their funds would be successful, but there are firms which are repeatedly successful", "i was lucky in the last year to get to meet bill gurley of benchmark, and bill was nice enough to give me a blurb for the jacket of my book, and i was very impressed by our conversation and by benchmark\u2019s record of achievement", "sequoia has a great record, as does as kleiner perkins, so you can do it, but it wouldn\u2019t be right for me", "that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not right for them", "macro \u2013 i said 15 minutes ago that macro funds have had a pretty bad record", "some of the greatest investors in history have been macro investors \u2013 george soros and stan druckenmiller, for example, have been fabulous", "they probably have the highest returns of everybody", "quantitative investing \u2013 renaissance and so forth", "so again, it would be a terrible form of hubris to say my way is the only way", "my way is the way that works for me", "by the way, if you look at the others, the success ratio is not terribly high, but certainly, there are people who\u2019ve done it well", "tim ferriss: yeah, there\u2019s a very high concentration of success in a handful, at least within venture", "yeah, bill\u2019s a very smart guy, and all the firms you\u2019ve mentioned have done really well", "so i\u2019ve heard it said \u2013 this is not from you in these words, i don\u2019t think \u2013 that the right decision at the wrong time is the wrong decision", "i\u2019m very excited about the new book and the literacy of cycles that you are helping people to develop with this", "we\u2019re going to wrap up in just a few questions", "are there any particular mental models or heuristics that are in this book or that you\u2019ve used in your investing life that you think are particularly valuable across the board in life", "i know that\u2019s a big question and you probably have quite a few directions you could go with that, but just in terms of becoming a clearer thinker and better-operating human being, does anything come to mind that we haven\u2019t discussed so far as it relates to any type of mental model that would be worth mentioning before we wrap up", "howard marks: well, tim, when i finished writing the book and i was thinking about cycles, i said to myself, \u201cso for example, the economy grows about 2-2.5 percent a year on average", "why doesn\u2019t it just grow 2.5 percent every year", "why is it sometimes four, sometimes one, sometimes five, and sometimes negative?\u201d and the answer is excesses and their correction", "people get too excited, they overexpand their businesses, they invest too much, or they invest too much using debt, and then something goes wrong, and their excesses produce booms, and then something goes wrong, and those excessive activities turn out to be unsustainable, and they are then corrected by selling off inventory, closing plants, or liquidating a leveraged portfolio, and those produce busts", "so it\u2019s from excesses and their corrections, and i think the best thing that people can do is be on the lookout for those things, and when other people are engaging in excesses to the upside, we should turn cautious, and when other people are overcorrecting to the downside, we should turn aggressive", "it\u2019s been a big part of what bruce and i have accomplished for the oaktree investors and my other partners and colleagues, and it\u2019s something that everybody can do if they turn their mind to it", "tim ferriss: well, howard, i really appreciate the time today", "howard marks: me too", "tim ferriss: this was very fun for me, and hopefully \u2013 and i believe it will be valuable for people listening", "just to mention a few things, of course, people can find mastering the market cycle: getting the odds on your side everywhere books are sold", "you can also learn more at masteringthemarketcycle.com, people can learn more about oaktree at oaktreecapital.com, and on social media, you have twitter, facebook, and linkedin all the same \u2013 howardmarksbook", "is there anything else you would like to say to the people listening, any recommendation or question they should ponder, action you might ask them to take \u2013 anything at all besides the book itself, which i encourage people to check out", "howard marks: well, first of all, we\u2019ve made repeated reference to my memos", "they\u2019re all available online at oaktreecapital.com under the heading of \u201cinsights > chairman\u2019s memos.\u201d you can get the last 29 years\u2019 worth", "you can also sign up for a service that will notify you when one is published", "the price is right because they\u2019re free, and i hope people will read them", "and i just want to say that i like to hear from people", "i don\u2019t always have time to answer everybody, but my writing of the memos and the books has been enormously rewarding because i get lovely memos from people which say that i made complex things seem clear", "that\u2019s the one that gets me going the most", "so if people want to comment, take issue, or ask a question, i\u2019ll try to get back to them", "tim ferriss: and is the best way to reach out to send you a note on social media", "i would advise against giving out any type of email address that will get deluged", "or maybe the answer is they should figure it out", "howard marks: well, we\u2019re on social media, and we\u2019d be glad to hear from them there", "tim ferriss: perfect", "well, howard, thank you again for the time, and for everybody listening, links to everything we discussed will be in the show notes as usual at tim.blog/podcast, and until next time, thank you for listening"]}
