Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. This is Tim Ferriss speaking. I should clarify that this episode is an edition of The Tim Ferriss Radio Hour, where I share the patterns and themes of world-class performers that I\u2019ve identified after more than 300 guests on the podcast. This particular episode is going to explore success. What does that mean? What a slippery, dangerous term. The particular guests I selected for this episode I would say represent not only achievement, but also appreciation and a well-rounded version of what I consider to be a successful human being. By any objective measure, certainly financially or otherwise, I\u2019ve interviewed some of the more successful people on the planet. In the next hour, we will revisit specific conversations that discuss the tips, disciplines, habits, and mindsets, perhaps most importantly, that separate world-class performers who reach their goals, from whose who fall short. This episode includes wisdom from Derek Sivers. Derek Sivers: I learned this the hard way at my last company because we had a quarter million customers. So, when I\u2019d send out an email to everyone, if any sentence was at all unclear in any way, I\u2019d get like 50,000 confused replies from people. Tim Ferriss: We also talk to Tony Robbins. Tony Robbins: You\u2019ve got to become an investor. You\u2019ve got to be an owner, not a consumer. The way to do that, frankly, we all know, but very few people do, is that you take a percentage, you lock it down, you never see it, it\u2019s automated, and you put it aside for investment and that just occurs. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ll hear from my good friend, Chris Sacca. Chris Sacca: Venture capital is totally unfair. People give me their money. I draw a management fee off it. So, they pay me to take their money and invest it for them. Tim Ferriss: Legendary investor, Ray Dalio. Ray Dalio: I think three things make up a successful life by and large. First, you have to have audacious goals \u2013 big dreams. Tim Ferriss: We can\u2019t talk success without including Sir Richard Branson. Richard Branson: One of the best things my parents taught me \u2013 I\u2019m going back a long way \u2013 if I ever said anything ill about anybody, they would sit me in front of the mirror for ten minutes in order to let me know how badly it reflected on me. Tim Ferriss: As a preface before we jump into the conversations with these guests, I thought it might be helpful to set the stage. That is with an observation that I have made, certainly, in interacting personally with many of my podcast guests and many name-brand folks in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. That is the following: the superheroes you might have in your mind, the idols, icons, elite athletes, billionaires, and so on, are nearly always walking flaws you\u2019ve maximized one or two strengths. Now, I\u2019m not saying that is true of the people in this episode, but in general, this is true. There are some mutants, there are some freaks of nature who are the equivalents of the Usain Bolts of the business world, for instance, but they are rare. In general, humans are very, very imperfect creatives, which would be a generous way to put it. You don\u2019t succeed, and most of the people I\u2019ve interviewed don\u2019t \u201csucceed\u201d because they or you have no weaknesses. Instead, you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around those strengths. You can get only a few things right consistently and outperform almost everybody else. I think that, for instance, the investment styles of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, who are both brilliant, granted, but who focus on being consistently not stupid, not consistently smarter than everybody else, which perhaps is a form of being smarter. It\u2019s important to keep in mind, rather than putting these people on a pedestal and viewing what they do as unreachable and, in a way then, absolving yourself of the responsibility of trying to improve yourself, that everyone is fighting a battle and has fought battles you know nothing about. There are many mega successful people who battle with depression, with pasts that might include alcoholism, you name it. That is not necessarily true of the people in this episode, but I think it\u2019s important to underscore that so that you think that through incremental improvement, you can actually put yourself in a position to achieve seemingly impossible things. That is the truth. Everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about. The icons is this episode are no different. Everyone struggles, so take solace in that. Now, without further ado, let\u2019s jump into some of the things that separate those who achieve what they set out to do from those who don\u2019t. Let\u2019s start with Derek Sivers. @Sivers on Twitter. S-I-V-E-R-S. He is one of my favorite human beings. Think of him as a philosopher, king, programmer, master teacher, and perhaps merry prankster. Originally a professional musician and circus clown \u2013 whole long story behind that, so listen to my long interview with him at tim.blog/derek. Derek created CD Baby in 1998. It became the largest seller of independent music online with $100 million in sales for more than 150,000 musicians. In 2008, Derek sold CD Baby for $22 million, giving the proceeds to a charitable trust for music education. He is a frequent speaker at the TED Conference, with more than 5 million views of his talks. Since 2011, he has published 34 books! What? Including a book titled Anything You Want, which I\u2019ve personally read at least a dozen times. Tim Ferriss: When you think of the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind and why? Derek Sivers: Well, the first answer to any question isn\u2019t much fun, because it\u2019s just automatic, right? Like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the first painting that comes to mind?\u201d \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d \u201cName a genius.\u201d \u201cEinstein.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s a composer?\u201d \u201cMozart.\u201d But this is the subject of the book, Thinking Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman. There\u2019s the instant, unconscious, automatic thinking, and then there\u2019s the slower, conscious, rational, deliberate thinking. So, I\u2019m really, really into he slower thinking. Like, breaking my automatic responses to the things in my life and slowly thinking through a more deliberate response instead. Then for the things in life where an automatic response is useful, I can create a new one consciously. So, like what if you asked, \u201cWhen you think of the word successful, who\u2019s the third person that comes to mind? And why are they actually more successful than the first person that came to mind?\u201d Well, in that case, the first person would be Richard Branson because he\u2019s like the stereotype, right? He\u2019s like the Mona Lisa of success, to me. Honestly, you might be my second answer, but we could talk about that a different time. My third and real answer, after thinking it through, is that we can\u2019t know without knowing a person\u2019s aims, right? Like, what if Richard Branson set out to live a quiet life, but like a compulsive gambler, he just can\u2019t stop creating companies? Well, then that changes everything and we can\u2019t really call him successful anymore. Tim Ferriss: What are the most common misconceptions about you? Derek Sivers: I feel pretty understood. I don\u2019t think people are thinking about me enough to conjure up any misconceptions. We think the goal of writing and communication is to be understood, but I think a better goal is just making sure that you\u2019re not misunderstood. I learned this the hard way at my last company because we had a quarter million customers. So, when I\u2019d send out an email to everyone, if any sentence was at all unclear in any way, I\u2019d get like 50,000 confused replies from people, which would take my team like 1,000 man hours to go through. So, now anything I put out into the public is rewritten and edited like crazy until I think it\u2019s as clear as can be. Tim Ferriss: What are you world-class at that people might now realize? Or what do you friends know you\u2019re world-class at that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t know about? Derek Sivers: I\u2019ve got the world\u2019s longest attention span. I\u2019ll just sit down and do one task for like 12 hours straight. Or all day for 25 days in a row. I love that my kid is getting it from me by the way that we play. Whenever we play, I never say, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Time to go!\u201d We just do something until he\u2019s ready to move on. He\u2019ll lead me to the river and just throw rocks in the way for a couple hours, then we\u2019ll go to the ocean and build a fort out of driftwood for hours, and then draw in the sand with shells until he\u2019s sleepy. We\u2019ve always done it this way, since he was like one year old. Other families would come play on the playground for 20 or 30 minutes at a time, but we would just be there for hours with him fully immersed in some newly invented game. What\u2019s funny is that nobody else can hang with us, not even his Mom. Everyone else gets so bored. People ask if I meditate or do yoga, but nope, my daily life feels like working meditation. Even being with my kid is like meditation, as you can tell. Okay, now, we\u2019re doing the format today where we\u2019re going to open up the phone to callers. But since it\u2019s Christmas Day, phones are a little slow \u2013 hey, there\u2019s a call. Dave DiGiovanni: Hi, Derek. This is Dave DiGiovanni from Kalamazoo, Michigan in the U.S.A. Thanks for doing the podcast with Tim. Thanks for taking this question. You\u2019ve helped a lot of people make money. I\u2019m just wondering if success in business has to be more complicated than that? I get overwhelmed reading all the \u2013 you know, there\u2019s so much content out there on how to make money, how to grow your business, how to start a business. I\u2019m just wondering if business needs to be more complicated that coming up with ideas on how to help other people succeed? Thank you. Derek Sivers: Well, let\u2019s talk about two things. Simple versus complicated and easy versus hard. Look at running. If you talk with people who hate running, you\u2019ll hear them say, \u201cUgh, first you have to get your running clothes, they you get dressed, and then you\u2019ve got to put on your shoes and you\u2019ve got to lace them up just right. Well, then you\u2019ve got to stretch and then you\u2019ve got to warm up. Then afterwards, you need to cool down and you need to shower. It\u2019s such a pain.\u201d But if you talk with people that love running, they\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, you just pop out for a quick run.\u201d And if you ask them about the steps involved, they\u2019ll say, \u201cThere\u2019s just run. You just run.\u201d So, knowing that we have this human nature to think of things we like as simple and things we don\u2019t as complicated, you can use this to deliberately simplify how you think of something you\u2019re avoiding, making it more appealing. An ultramarathon is simple. You just 100 miles to the end. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy, right? So, success in business can be simple. You just find a need that people are proving they\u2019re willing to pay for, and then find a profitable way to solve that need for them. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy. What you have to do is notice, in your mind, when you\u2019re complications are holding you back, and then turn the dial towards simplicity in your mind. You just jump out the door and start running. But then notice in your results where a more simplified approach might be holding you back. Like perhaps you\u2019re using only one tool in your toolbox and you need to learn others. As for all the business advice out there, if information was the answer, then we\u2019d all be billionaires with perfect abs. Really you, and yeah you, listening to this, most of you probably just need to shut that shit off, put your blinders on, and get out the door and start running. Metaphorically speaking, that is. Tobin: Hi, this is Tobin in Boulder, Colorado. My question is, what should someone ask to determine their own Utopia? Thanks. Derek Sivers: First, ask yourself is this in theory or in practice? Have you proven from your experience that this is really what works best for you? Whatever idea you have, you have to challenge it. You need to argue against it because there\u2019s so many things that seem great in theory. For example, say you\u2019re living in a little apartment in a noisy city and so you think that you\u2019d be happy if only you had a big place out in the silent country. And so you do it, you splurge, you buy a place or you sign a year-long lease and then you move out to the country and \u2026 uh-oh, after two months, you realize that you miss too many things about the big city. You made the wrong prediction. It happens the other way too, right? People moving from the quiet \u2018burbs to the big city. Or somebody who\u2019s an employee that thinks they\u2019d just be happy if they could quit their job and start their own business. And oops, it doesn\u2019t always work out like that. My recommendation is to do little tests. Try a few months of living the life you think you want, but leave yourself an exit plan, being open to the chance, the big chance, that you might not like it after actually trying it. The best book about this subject is Stumbling On Happiness by Daniel Gilbert. His recommendation is to talk to a few people that are currently where you think you want to be, and ask them for the pros and cons, and then trust their operation, since they\u2019re right in it, not just remembering or imagining. James McGill: This is James McGill from Sligo, Ireland. My question is, how do you define success and what habits or skills are most important to living a successful life? Thanks. Derek Sivers: Okay, well, first let\u2019s define success. Ask yourself if you think Robin Williams and Philip Seymore Hoffman were successful actors? I think it\u2019s a tough call. My first reaction is yes, but the more I think about it, my answer moves halfway towards no. As a different example, think of someone you know who you\u2019d consider to be the definition of a total loser and then you give that person a million dollars. Are they now a winner? Of course not. That sounds like a contrived example. But a lot of fame and fortune is dropped into the laps of people who were just the right face in the right place at the right time, but are actually miserable, awful people by any definition. So, the more you think it through, the more you realize that you have to define success first by your inner game, not some outside measure of money or fame. Mastering yourself, your mind, and your actions. But now, if you only master yourself and you don\u2019t help anyone else, then we\u2019d call you happy, but nobody would define you as successful. The very definition of success must include how much you helped others. I bet that if you helped thousands of people, even if you didn\u2019t ultimately profit from it but you were personally miserable? Well, we might still call you successful because you helped others. The point is, if you want to be undeniably successful, you need to both master yourself and help others. Don\u2019t focus on the money or the fame. The real success is mastering your emotions and actions and actually helping lots of people. So, that\u2019s the definition. But now you asked what habits or skills are most important to living a successful life? Well, by this definition, habits and skills \u2013 No. 1, the skill and habit of managing your state and your emotional reactions and actions. No. 2, knowing what people need in general and what you need in particular. No. 3, people skills. How to see things from the other person\u2019s point of view and how to communicate from their point of view. No. 4, the ability to focus, learn, practice, and apply what you learn. If you can do those four things, you can do anything. You can first be happy without depending on anyone or anything in particular, and then you can understand what people need, learn how to provide it, and make sure they know it. Tim Ferriss: Next up is Tony Robbins. @TonyRobbins on Twitter and elsewhere. The world\u2019s most famous performance coach. He\u2019s advised everyone from Bill Clinton to Mikhail Gorbachev to Serena Williams and Leonardo DiCaprio to Oprah, who calls him superhuman, by the way. That\u2019s Oprah calling someone that. I love Tony\u2019s work and his Personal Power II set, which I listened to in my POS used mini-van while I was commuting during my first job. It helped me start my first company. Recently, I should say over the last several years, I\u2019ve had the chance to work with Tony, get to know him directly, and it\u2019s been an incredible experience. Tony has worked with many legendary investors, including Paul Tudor Jones, who he\u2019s coached for more than ten years, Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, David Swenson, Kyle Bass, and many more. These are the hard-to-interview unicorns who consistently beat the market, despite the fact that it\u2019s considered impossible by many folks. Tony has done a great of job of, I would say, condensing the lessons he\u2019s learned from them. Tony Robbins: Some guys are like Templeton; I got to interview him multiple times before he tied. It\u2019s like wait for the blood-letting. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u00a0 No, blood in the streets. That\u2019s when you invest, yeah. Tony Robbins: Blood in the streets. But it\u2019s like when maximum pessimism hits, that\u2019s when you make all your money. That\u2019s what he did. Then there\u2019s the guys like Bogle, which is it\u2019s the index, baby. These days, even Warren Buffet, it\u2019s the index baby. So they\u2019re all different approaches. But what\u2019s in common, I think is \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you four things I saw that stood out. One is overly simplistic and that\u2019s why people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but these guys pay attention to it. They don\u2019t lose. Half the peak awakening is not losing and they are obsessed, every single one of them is obsessed with not losing money. I mean, a level of obsession that\u2019s mind-boggling. It isn\u2019t just these investors. Sir Richard Branson, for example, people see Richard and he\u2019s such an ongoing, playful guy. He\u2019s kind of an introvert about certain areas. But when it comes to athletics and taking out challenges, he\u2019s out in the world. But his first question to every business is, what\u2019s the downside and how do I protect it? When he did his piece with Virgin, that\u2019s a big risk. Starting an airline? He went to Boeing and negotiated a deal they could send the planes back if it didn\u2019t work out and he wasn\u2019t liable. That\u2019s the level these guys think at. So, they first look to see how do I not lose money? Because the average person has no clue. If I lose 50% in 2008, well, guess what? You\u2019ve got to make 100% to get even, not 50%, because your principal has gone down so much. People don\u2019t understand. You lose 60%. It\u2019s 200% to get even. The average person lives in a world where they try not to lose money, but they\u2019re not obsessed. These are obsessed. The second thing they all have in common: every single one of them is obsessed with asymmetrical risk reward, which is a big word. It simply means they\u2019re looking to use the least amount of risk to get the maximum out of upside, and that\u2019s what they live for. I\u2019ll give you an example. Paul Tudor, when I first went to do the turnaround, Paul was challenging times. He\u2019d broken his leg. Think about this \u2013 he did better than anybody in the history of the world during the biggest stock market drop in history, literally, and then he went to the mountain, he went to the moon, and now what? So, he lost a bit of the edge and got involved in other things and so forth. Now, he\u2019s got a broken leg. He\u2019s not going to the office. I\u2019ve got to come in. So, I had to go watch that film. That\u2019s the first thing I did. Tim Ferriss: The white tennis shoes. Tony Robbins: I wanted to go see everything about him. Study his physiology, the way he used to move because this guy is not moving at all. What his face was like, how he breathed, the tone of his voice, what were the physical strategies, what were the psychological strategies, what were the financial strategies. I got to go to Druckenmiller and Soros. The world I had access to back then was unbelievable. To see what he was like then, to put the plan together to do this turnaround. When I started making those shifts in him, you could see the shift happen immediately, it got really exciting. I got hooked on what was going to happen. I did this same process, basically, talking about doing things once. I did the same process during his interviews. I didn\u2019t just look at the trading strategies. I looked at the psychology of what set it up. But here\u2019s what I found with Paul Tudor in the very beginning in getting him back on track. When he\u2019s at his best, he made sure every single trade had what he called a 5 to 1. That means, if he was going to risk $1.00, he wasn\u2019t about to risk it unless he was certain he was going to make $5.00. Now, you\u2019re not always right, so guess what? If I risk $1.00 to make $5.00 and I\u2019m wrong, I can another dollar and still make $4.00. I can be wrong four times out of five and still break even. Their secret is not that they\u2019re not wrong, it\u2019s they set themselves up where they risk small amounts for big rewards, proportionally. Paul, if he\u2019s right one out of three times, he still makes 20%. So, the average person risks $1.00 trying to make how much? Tim Ferriss: $1.10. Tony Robbins: That\u2019s right. About $1.10. If I could get 10%, wow, my dollar, right? 20% would be unbelievable. How often can you be wrong? Tim Ferriss: Not every often. Tony Robbins: Not at all, right? You\u2019re in the whole. You\u2019re starting from the whole and you\u2019ve got to build back up. So, there\u2019s asymmetrical reward. I was with Kyle Bass and Kyle Bass risked \u2013 check this out \u2013 in the middle of the sub-prime crisis, he was $2 billion out of $30 million because he risked for every $0.06 he risked, he had an upside of $1.00. $0.06 for $1.00. Well, you could be wrong 15 times and you\u2019re still looking in that area. I mean, he was brilliant to figure it out. He is a genius for figuring it out. But that risk/reward is why it is. He showed his kids. I said, \u201cHow do I teach this to the average investor?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, you can teach them the way I taught my kids.\u201d I said, \u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d He goes, \u201cWe bought nickels.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean, you bought nickels?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I did research. I have this question\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s another thing that all these guys do, they ask a better question. And we talked about, they get better answers right? Better quality question, better quality answer. What\u2019s wrong with me? You\u2019ll come up with stuff? How do I make this happen no matter want? You\u2019ll come up with different answers. His question was, \u201cWhere in the world is there a riskless trade with total upside?\u201d He started looking around and he said, \u201cI\u2019m worried about inflation,\u201d so he decided, \u201cWell, gosh, of all the currencies in the world, a nickel, what it\u2019s made of today,\u201d it\u2019s not made mostly of nickel by the way, he said, \u201cit\u2019s costing the U.S. government $0.095 to make a nickel. That\u2019s how our government functions. I\u2019m going to spend almost $0.10 to make something half as much, right? Tim Ferriss: The Pentagon plan. Tony Robbins: Yeah, that\u2019s right. The perfect plan. So he said, \u201cBut you know what? Just the actual material value is $0.068,\u201d or something $0.065 we\u2019ll call it for round numbers. So he said, \u201cIf I buy a nickel, it\u2019s never going less than a nickel unless you believe the U.S. government is gone. So I\u2019ve got something that never goes down in value. So, I\u2019ve got a guaranteed return. I\u2019m not going to lose my principal. By day one, it\u2019s worth 36% more than the day I bought it. How many investments can you have 100% guaranty of no less and a 36%?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s value. They passed a law a few years ago, I think Charlie Rangel or whoever it was pushed it through.\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, but Tony, that doesn\u2019t matter. Because let me tell you why.\u201d He said, \u201cLook at pennies. When they changed it from pure copper to tin and all the things they changed, what happened to the old pennies? There\u2019s a scarcity of them and now a penny from those days is worth $0.02. It\u2019s 100% more valuable. So, he said, \u201cAt some point, the government cannot continue to do something that costs twice at much. At some point, they\u2019ll make a change in the materials and then all these nickels are worth an unbelievable amount.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m just showing my kids. You need to think different than everybody else. Don\u2019t think on it to take huge risks for huge rewards. Say, how do I take no risk and get huge rewards?\u201d And because you ask that question continuously and you believe in the answer, you get it. He said, \u201cListen, if I could convert my entire wealth into nickels right now, I\u2019d do it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d He goes, \u201cI am insane.\u201d But it\u2019s the best possible fundamental investment. He started telling me how to do it. He bought 40 million nickels Tim Ferriss: Wow. Tony Robbins: He had 40 million nickels. It fills up a room bigger than this. Tim Ferriss: It had better be on the ground floor. Tony Robbins: He had his kids ragging at me and everybody else laughing and having fun. It\u2019s like their little treasure room. Tim Ferriss: So he can legitimately do like the Scrooge McDuck backstroke through a pool full of nickels. Tony Robbins: For real, with nickels. So, there\u2019s asymmetrical reward. I\u2019ll give you one more and I\u2019ll shut the hell up. You told the difference and there are differences. We could spend hours and hours on the differences but what I think\u2019s useful is what\u2019s aligned because then it gives universal that can be applied. The other one for them is they absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, know they\u2019re going to be wrong. You look at these talking heads on television and people screaming at you and hitting bells and telling you what to buy and they\u2019re right, right, right. The best on earth, the Ray Dalios, right? The Pebbles, I don\u2019t care who you talk about. You want to look at Carl Icahn. They all know they\u2019re going to be wrong, so they set up an asset allocation system that will make them successful. They all agree asset allocation is the single most important investment. There wasn\u2019t one person in terms of your vehicle that it wasn\u2019t the most important thing. No matter how they attacked it, asset allocation was the element there. The last one is, they\u2019re lifelong learners. These people are machines. Like you, like me, like Peter, like most of the people you and I share as friends, they just are obsessed with knowing more. Because the more they know, the more they realize what they didn\u2019t know and then they apply that and they go to another level. Every time you think you\u2019re the best you can be in anything in life, your body, your emotion, your spirit, your finances, there\u2019s always another level. These guys live by it. The last one, I thought almost of them were real givers. Not just givers on the surface like money givers, that\u2019s wonderful. But really passionate about giving. It showed up once they saw what I was doing was legitimate and was really real. Then they\u2019re opening up three hours of their time with something none of these guys will ever get. Tim Ferriss: I think it was Dalio who said something along the lines of \u201cLosers react; winners anticipate.\u201d Tony Robbins: That was actually me, but that\u2019s okay. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s you! Tony Robbins: Give it to me, Dalio. Tim Ferriss: Take that as a compliment! No, but the point being that the \u2013 and I guess a Mark Twain quote is also in there, which was \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it rhymes.\u201d So, there are going to be crashes. There are going to be Black Swan events. You want to have a plan in place for when that happens. Tony Robbins: Exactly right. Ray Dalio actually said something in there that stuck with me brutally. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what it is that you think you\u2019re great at investing in or you like.\u201d Most people invest in what they like. Real estate or stocks or bonds, or what they think they\u2019re good at, or what they were raised with. He said, \u201cWhatever asset class you invest in, I promise you in your lifetime, it will drop no less than 50% and more likely 70% at some point.\u201d He said, \u201cThat is why you absolutely must diversify.\u201d Because you\u2019re saying, \u201cBut I could make so much more on this side.\u201d I\u2019ve had people throughout the years \u2013 I teach this bucket theory. This idea that if you want to make asset allocation simple, it sounds like such a big word, it\u2019s just buckets. Some of my money is going to go in a secure bucket. That bucket is like a church steeple. It\u2019s not going away. It\u2019s very secure type investments. Its upside is not gigantic in terms of speed, but the compounding process, if you give it enough time, those low returns are giant returns still, but you\u2019re not going to lose. Then there\u2019s this bucket what most people call a \u201cgrowth\u201d bucket, I call a \u201crisk growth,\u201d because it\u2019s really risk first. On that, I\u2019m taking bigger risks for potentially greater rewards. Now the question is, how do I balance these? Am I 60/40, 50/50, 80/20? That\u2019s designed really by three things. No. 1, what\u2019s your real risk tolerance, what you think it is? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and they\u2019re never the same. Tony Robbins: They\u2019re never the same. I do these wealth mastery programs in a few years and invariably I\u2019ll do some crazy thing like I\u2019ll say, \u201cEverybody stand up, make change.\u201d They look at me and I go, \u201cMake change.\u201d Then they start reaching in their pockets and making change. And so somebody will pull out $5.00 and $10.00. Somebody pulled out $100.00 and somebody will come up and will take it and give them $5.00 and they\u2019re like \u2026 they don\u2019t know how to react. So, this goes on for three or four minutes and the music is going on. I go okay, stop, all right, sit down. And they go on like I\u2019m talking about something else. Invariably, somebody\u2019s like, \u201cHey, wait a second. I want my $100.00 back.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He\u2019s said, \u201cI want my $100.00 back. The game is over.\u201d I said, \u201cWhen did you think the game was over? When did you think the game had ever gone over and who said it was your $100.00?\u201d It takes a while and then finally get, I\u2019m stressed about $100.00. What do you think is going to happen when you lose $1 million or $500,000, or $10,000 or $10,000? Your risk tolerance is not what you think it is. So when you find out what your risk tolerance is, and we\u2019ve got great ways to do that in the book, and then you figure out really, how much time do you have? When you\u2019re younger, you\u2019ve got more time to make mistakes and so you can take bigger risks. You\u2019ve got timeline on your side. The next piece is, how much is your cash flow? What\u2019s going to be the bigger role for you? If you look at those three things, how you can decide how much goes in my secure bucket, how much goes in my growth? If you don\u2019t make that decision, it\u2019s the most important investment decision of your life according to everybody I interviewed. Like what percentage secure, what percentage growth and risk? Then when things come up, you\u2019re always going to go for the growth/risk because it looks so sexy and exciting and I can\u2019t tell you how many people over the years have done this. They\u2019re telling me, why would I put money over here when I\u2019ve got this real estate I\u2019m making 120%? I have a friend that build some of the first big condos in Vegas back in the boom time. He actually went to my programs, sold the business he had made $200 million, invested in these condos, starting building the Panorama Towers and places of that nature. He was up to like three-quarters of a billion. I kept saying to him, \u201cDude, take some of your growth money and put it in the secure bucket,\u201d right? How many times have I told you this? He goes, \u201cTone, I love you. I made $200 million because of you. But now, I\u2019m really, whatever I touch goes into gold.\u201d I\u2019m listening to this. I\u2019m going, \u201cI love you brother, but do you know how many times I\u2019ve had this conversation?\u201d And then guess what happens in 2008? How much do you think he lost? He was worth three quarters of a billion dollars. He\u2019d grown that rapidly in those short years. What do you think happened to his net worth? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m guessing it went down, according to the Ray Dalio prediction. Tony Robbins: How about -$400 million. He didn\u2019t just lose what he had, he lost everything he had and beyond. So then he\u2019s trying to negotiate \u2013 Tim Ferriss: So he was leveraged. Tony Robbins: He was leveraged out. He wiped himself out. Most people don\u2019t put enough in the security bucket is the lesson. A guy like that will provide you a strategy that\u2019s got great sustainability, but there are many approaches in the book. But you do have to decide, how much is secure? How much is growth? I show you how to do that. Tim Ferriss: Chris Sacca, @sacca, was once the cover story of the Midas issue of Forbes magazine, and I\u2019ve known him for some time. But that\u2019s what happens when you are, for instance, an early-stage investor in companies like Twitter, Uber, Instagram, Kickstarter, and many more. Chris is the name, the face behind what will most certainly be the most successful venture capital time of all time \u2013 Lowercase Capital. Here are a few thoughts on success that I\u2019ve found fascinating. Tim Ferriss: What are the commonalities, or are there commonalities, when you look across these founders for whom success and massive scale just seems predestined? What are the commonalities? Chris Sacca: We\u2019ll take Evan Travis\u2019 examples, but across the most successful founders, let\u2019s use a Matt Mullenweg, WordPress. That\u2019s a $1 billion company, $1 billion-plus. These guys are all incredible listeners. When they do open their mouths, it can be bombastic and offensive and aggressive and in-your-face, but they\u2019re all incredible listeners. I don\u2019t just mean in casual conversation. These guys go out of their way to interview other people. If you catch Ev, he\u2019s got a notebook always. If you ask him to see the last few pages of the notebook, he\u2019s just meeting with other people who are billionaires and leaders whose jobs might not overlap with his at all, but from whom he\u2019s learning. He\u2019s a voracious reader. Part of why Medium started is he was really back deep into long-form content when he took a break from Twitter. That guy is just constantly learning, studying, studying. When he speaks, it matters. But he\u2019s listening more than he speaks. You know that about Mullenweg. One of the most thoughtful people. I\u2019ve never seen anyone read as many books as that guys does and retain all the knowledge. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s prolific. He also listens to anyone that he\u2019s sitting down with. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the waitress or a primary school teacher. We\u2019ve done a lot of traveling together. He was on the podcast also. A very good listener. Chris Sacca: Again, you just look across the board. These guys are learning. They\u2019re modeling. They\u2019re constantly researching. They\u2019re gathering data. Travis would think it a competitive disadvantage for you to know exactly what\u2019s going on in his head sometimes. So, he\u2019ll listen. It\u2019s an amazing talent. I think it\u2019s a commonality across those people. Tim Ferriss: With the investing game that you\u2019ve obviously been a participant in for quite a while now, you have to say no a lot. I took a close look at poker in the last year with the TV show. There were a couple of quotes that came up quite a bit, along the lines of \u201cI made my money sitting, not playing hands.\u201d But that having been said, what are some of the deals, the whales that got away? Chris Sacca: First of all, this is a rigged game, right? I\u2019m just looking to make it even more rigged. For those who don\u2019t know, venture capital is totally unfair. People give me their money. I draw a management fee off it. They pay me to take their money and invest it for them. If I make money, then I pay them back the management fee and then after that, we split the profits and I get a really big chunk of the profits. If I lose money, that\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t come out of my pocket. I keep my fee and my investors lose money. That\u2019s how this industry works. That\u2019s bananas. At some point, it\u2019s going to break. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve also incepted me with the term \u201cbananas,\u201d which I\u2019ve started using compulsively. Mazio also has done the same thing. He works with Chris. Chris Sacca: It\u2019s just an unforgivably, unfair, rigged game that\u2019s in favor of the venture capitalists. The reality is the risk of an investor doesn\u2019t begin to compare to the risk of a founder. That\u2019s one thing that kind of draws me crazy about some investors. I love the entrepreneurial spirit that goes into building a firm. I built my firm from scratch and there are certainly founder-type lessons in there. But your cash will positive from day one when you start a venture fund. Your downside is incredibly limited by the structure of the fund. So that said, what it allows me to do is place some bets on some stuff that I\u2019d like to think success is inevitable with those things. But I can look at the risk analysis and say is the binary outcome a 1 or a 0? Some of those things just don\u2019t get there. One of my constant recurring nightmares is about the stuff I passed on. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. That\u2019s what I was trying to ask. Chris Sacca: I\u2019ve done some deals where I thought it was going to be a lot bigger and it ends up going away. The Dropbox guys, I met those guys very early on, while they were still on Y Combinator. I got an early look. I had an opportunity to do the deal and I pulled those guys aside and I said, \u201cHey, look. At Google, we\u2019re using a version of this called Platypus,\u201d which became G Drive. \u201cThey\u2019re going to crush you guys, man. You should probably find some other product to pivot to.\u201d That probably costs me hundreds of millions of dollars. Tim Ferriss: Did they give you a pat on the head and walk away? Chris Sacca: No, I mean, when I see Drew, the CEO of Dropbox, I bring it up before he can. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good self-defense maneuver. Chris Sacca: Yeah, I get it out there right away. The Airbnb guys at Y Combinator. Same thing. Tim Ferriss: Incredible business. Chris Sacca: An amazing business. And one to be proud of too. I\u2019m really jealous I\u2019m not in that business. Not just for the business, but I love what they do. I really admire them a lot and their culture. But at the time, they were allowing you to rent out a room in somebody\u2019s house while the owner was still there and that just seemed really scary to me. I pulled the guys aside and I was just like, \u201cGuys. Somebody\u2019s going to raped or murdered in one of the houses and the blood is going to be on your hands.\u201d I literally said that out loud to them. What\u2019s that worth? Like $15 or $20 billion now? Tim Ferriss: Now, in fairness, you\u2019re probably not wrong, right? I mean, at a certain scale. Chris Sacca: At scale, it has to happen. Tim Ferriss: Something\u2019s going to happen. Chris Sacca: Yeah. I like to say sometimes when you think about scale, like someone who works at Walmart murdered someone last night. There\u2019s just no doubt about it. At that scale, with a few millions employees, one of them murdered somebody last night. Tim Ferriss: You have to look at it like Edward Norton Fight Club. Like an actuarial analysis for insurance. Which is terrifying, but that\u2019s the reality of big numbers. Chris Sacca: There\u2019s one other famous one. There\u2019s a bunch of these. Actually, I\u2019ll give you two. I wasn\u2019t reminded of this until recently. Nick Woodman from GoPro came to Google. I wasn\u2019t an investor at the time, but I did a lot of Google\u2019s investments and partnerships. Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, said, \u201cHey, will you come in here and sit with this pitch. He\u2019s a friend of a friend who said we\u2019ve got to meet this guy.\u201d So, Woodman comes in with GoPro. Eric\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was like, \u201cWe\u2019d be foolish to do this deal. How is this guy from Santa Cruz going to compete with all these Asians in building hardware? You can\u2019t hold a candle to the Taiwanese and the Koreans.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo dice, man. Let this guy go.\u201d I think I introduced him to somebody over at YouTube just as a consolation. I saw that dude this winter skiing. He worth like $3 or $4 billion now and he didn\u2019t forget that meeting. Then the Snapshot guys. I gave a talk in L.A. and they came up to me. I\u2019d never met them before. They came up after the talk and said, \u201cWe\u2019re big fans and we\u2019d really like to work with you.\u201d I was like, \u201cEh, sure. I mean, I know you guys are up to something cool. I admire it.\u201d I took like eight weeks to set up the meeting and by then, the Benchmark guys had done that deal. That\u2019s, again, ohmygod, I can\u2019t imagine how much money we\u2019ve left on the table as a result of that. I like to say when I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong and when I\u2019m right, I\u2019m really, really right. Tim Ferriss: Ray Dalio, @raydalio on Twitter, is one of the 100 most influential people in the world, according to time and one of the 100 wealthiest people in the word, according to Forbes. Because of his unique investment principles that have changed industries, CIO magazine dubbed him \u201cthe Steve Jobs of investing.\u201d Ray believes his success is the result of principles he\u2019s learned codified and applied to his life and business. Those principles are detailed in his book, aptly titled, Principles. He includes some of his wisdom in our interview. Tim Ferriss: If we flash back to when you first began Bridgewater Associates. So, out of your 2-bedroom apartment at 26 years old. Do you recall any of your first big wins or things that you considered big wins at the time? I\u2019d love to just hear you describe what made those a big win. In other words, the thinking behind it. Ray Dalio: The funny thing is, I can hardly ever remember my big wins. I do remember my big losses or my big mistakes. Tim Ferriss: We can talk about those too, yeah. Ray Dalio: It\u2019s so funny because I look at it and say, well, I guess I must have had a bunch of wins or successes because of how things have went. The business is good and done well and all of that. But I think of my history and I really think of those mistakes. I think that\u2019s so great because it shows that that\u2019s a much better learning tool. Okay, so my big wins. No, I think about that time. The things I remember were the fun things. Guys I played rugby with, and parties, and those kinds of things. I don\u2019t remember a particularly big winning. Well, I do remember some things. I remember one time when we got the Kodak account. Again, I was in a position, it\u2019s okay, here\u2019s a guy and he\u2019s analyzing the markets and he has a small team of people. He\u2019s analyzing the markets. I didn\u2019t have a long track record and I didn\u2019t have an institution and I was sort of competing with the big institutions of the word \u2013 the JP Morgans and everybody. By the way, we beat them. But anyway, what shows that the individuals, the power is with the individual. But anyway, I remember when we got the Kodak account, because at the time Kodak was a big, important client. Them giving us that account was a big deal for us because it was kind of a stamp of institutional approval and it was \u2013 I remembered the money mattered too because we would know that we were a bit more financially secure. I remember that as a big win. I remember it so terrifically because we were asked to submit research information. We were just a small team of people. We stayed up all night and with pizza and beer and all of that. I remember it so sweetly because it was the dream of making our miracle happen. The pulling together. That\u2019s the meaningful relationships part. I believe that I want meaningful work and meaningful relationships. That was what that was about. We got the account and we won and that was a big deal. Tim Ferriss: Why did you guys win? Ray Dalio: I think it\u2019s a combination of being totally unconventional and having better processes and then there\u2019s a hell of a lot of determination. I think three things make up a successful life, by and large. First, you have to have audacious goals, big dreams. Then, when you are headed towards those goals, you\u2019re going to have problems. You\u2019re going to deal with reality. You have to deal with those problems and that reality realistically, learning from mistakes, writing down those principles and the like. So, that\u2019s the second part. Dealing with reality in a practical way where you learn about mistakes. Then the third is the determination. Because if you\u2019re going for your goals and you\u2019re encountering your mistakes and you\u2019re learning and you do that with determination, you\u2019re going to get better all the time. You can\u2019t help but get better. You do that a long enough amount of time and you\u2019re going to far exceed your dreams. My success has far exceeded what I ever imagined one bit at a time. It\u2019s just that process. Tim Ferriss: If you were to conversely look at intelligent people who are unhappy, what do you think the primary causes of that unhappiness are? Ray Dalio: I think it goes back to this notion of meaningful work and meaningful relationships. Intelligence and happiness probably have no correlation with each other. In studies, it\u2019s repeatedly been shown and money is very little correlated with happiness. The highest correlation with happiness is community. Am I part of a community? Do I feel connections with other people? That\u2019s been literally genetically programmed into us from, it\u2019s estimated between a million and two million years ago, before we were even mankind. So, that sense of meaningful relationships, I think, is very, very important. If you have meaningful work, like you\u2019re on a mission, and you have meaningful relationships, I think it\u2019s almost impossible not to be happy. There will be unhappy moments in your life that you encounter this thing or that, but the people who are unhappy seem to be missing those things. Tim Ferriss: Last but certainly not least, we have Sir Richard Branson, @richardbranson on Twitter and everywhere else. Founder and Chairman of The Virgin Group, a world-famous entrepreneur, adventurer, activist, and business icon. He has launched a dozen billion-dollar businesses and hundreds of other companies. I loved our conversation and highly recommend you check it out, of course. Listen to the whole thing. But here are a few highlights you might find valuable. Tim Ferriss: You strike me as a really good negotiator. By necessity, you\u2019d have to be. If you had, say a would-be entrepreneur or a university senior, someone who\u2019s about to graduate and go into the real world and they tell you that they want to become a very good negotiator, a very good deal maker. How would you train them or what would you recommend they do or read to become a better negotiator or deal maker? Because you seem very, very astute and subtle in structuring things in very smart ways. What would you say to someone who wants to develop that skillset? Richard Branson: I\u2019m sure that there must be ways of being taught it, but in my operation, nothing beats personal experience. My education was being thrown into the jungle, being thrown into the real world at age 15 or 16 and having to survive. It was an incredible education. I learned about everything in life. I\u2019ve [inaudible] [00:49:09] a lot, so I\u2019ve met people all over the world. I had to do a lot of different negotiations. I think as I\u2019ve got older, I\u2019ve realized that one of the most important things about a negotiation is striking a deal that is fair to both sides. I\u2019ve also realized as I get older that you\u2019ll always come across the same people time and time again in life, and so your reputation is everything. In my new book, Finding My Virginity, I talk about our dealings with Delta and how they felt that they\u2019d legged us over in a clause in a contract and how they came to us to rectify it. That\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget and most likely will be partners with Delta for the rest of my life because of that kind of approach. I think if you realize that your reputation is all you have and your personal reputation, the reputation of your brand, then you\u2019ve got to make sure that you\u2019re negotiating a deal that you\u2019re not going to be unhappy with and you think of all the things that could potentially go wrong and how you can get out of it if something goes wrong, but equally important is trying to strike a fair balance with the people you\u2019re negotiating with. Tim Ferriss: When we\u2019re looking internally, you mentioned how your teammates at the record company thought you were crazy when you brought up the airline. Are there any business ideas that you\u2019re glad your coworkers or team have prevented you from doing? Richard Branson: As you know, my nickname is Dr. Yes. I have books like, Screw It, Just Do It. To be honest, if I want to do something, one of the advantages of owning the company is I can normally get away with it. I mean, I\u2019ll try, obviously, to carry people with me. I\u2019m sure there have been one or two things where I have bullied the process through or I\u2019ve regretted \u2013 well, not regretted. I\u2019ve never regretted anything. But where perhaps I should have listened more to others. But I can\u2019t think of anything where they persuaded me not to do it. I think most likely, when it comes to a decision about whether to do something or not, I like to think of myself as a benevolent dictator. That\u2019s the one thing I sort of generally get my own way on. Look, we would never have gone into space travel. We\u2019ll come to that I\u2019m sure later on in this talk, unless I was willing to do things against the sensible. What on paper would be sensible advice of my fellow directors. Tim Ferriss: We will definitely get to space travel. What I\u2019m curious about, because it seems if I look at many of the businesses that you\u2019ve started, the positioning is often against a particular incumbent \u2013 in the case of airlines, for instance \u2013 that seems to be a common element in a lot of the company or product launches. I want to connect that with some of your well-known adventures. You\u2019ll see where this is going in a second. You\u2019ve driven a tank down Fifth Avenue; crossed the English Channel in an amphibious car; took a 407-jump off the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas; gone from Morocco to Hawaii in a hot air balloon. You are very adept at PR stunts, getting attention for the things that you do and the companies that you do. Are there any particular best practices or a playbook that you have found to be very \u2013 or principles, for that matter, helpful with the launching of a new company or product? Richard Branson: I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m a great believer in trying. If you team worked really hard to launch a new business with you or for you, the least I think I can do is make a fool of myself, make sure that new business ends up on the front page of the newspapers rather than an anecdote on the last pages of the newspapers. So, if that means having to use myself to put the new company on the map, I will do so. I will try to do it in a way that makes people smile and that doesn\u2019t horribly backfire on me. It hasn\u2019t usually backfired. I suppose it\u2019s like being a host to a party. If you\u2019re the host of the party, if you\u00a0 stand in the corner of the room and you sip your sherry and stand around with your fellow directors all in suits, everyone\u2019s going to have a thoroughly dull party and nobody will have a good time. If you\u2019re the host of the party and you\u2019re first in the swimming pool and everybody else jumps in too, yeah, they may be a bit cold for the rest of the evening, but they\u2019re going to have a great evening. I think the same applies when you\u2019re launching a business. Make sure that you put it on the map and just occasionally it will backfire. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned space travel, which I do want to use as a touching off point to ask you \u2013 roughly 50 years after starting your first business, why write Finding My Virginity? What was the catalyst for that? Why do it? Richard Branson: I actually think everybody should write a book about their lives. I\u2019ve persuaded a number of people to write books about their lives. Steve Fossett, for instance. Anyway, a number of people. You don\u2019t have to have led a very public life. I think everyone\u2019s led interesting lives. Your children and your grandchildren will be fascinated by the lives you lead. I wrote a book, Losing My Virginity, when I was a young man, about all the adventures. It became a bestseller and sold millions of copies. But I was quite a young man when I wrote it. The last 20 years or so have been very full and very rich and extraordinary. I thought I would write in a sense a sequel to Losing My Virginity, which we called Finding my Virginity. If I life another 20 years, Virginity Found I suspect will be my last book. We\u2019ll see how we go. I think it\u2019s important. I love reading and learning and I think others hopefully will enjoy it. When I write books, I try not to make them like \u201cand then we did and then we did that.\u201d Just try to make it a really good, gripping read and an enjoyable read and not try to prime in everything one\u2019s done in 20 years. Hopefully, people will get a few gems form it as well. Tim Ferriss: What is the book or books you\u2019ve given most as a gift and why? Outside of your own books. Are there any particular books that you\u2019ve given or recommended to others the most? Richard Branson: Climate Change is something which I\u2019ve spent a lot of time on. I would highly recommend a book by Tim Flannery called The Weather Makers, which was one of the books that opened my eyes to the problem that we have in the world. I\u2019m just reading Homo Deus, and I will carry on to read Sapiens, one of his first books. I just love the style of his writing. I love books where you\u2019re learning something from them, rather than if I want fiction, I\u2019ll get a good film out. If I\u2019m reading books, I like to read books which have got some substance. Tim Ferriss: In the last, let\u2019s just call it five years or so, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life or what habit has improved your life? It could be any new belief, behavior, or habit that has markedly improved your life. Richard Branson: If we go back a bit further than the last five years. Tim Ferriss: We can go back as far as you like, absolutely. Richard Branson: One of the best things my parents taught me \u2013 I\u2019m going back a long way \u2013 if I ever said anything ill about anybody, they would sit me in front of the mirror for ten minutes in order to let me know how badly it reflected on me. I like to think I\u2019ve never generally spoken ill about other people. I think that\u2019s been one of the best bits of advice that I\u2019ve ever received and obviously then given. Archbishop Tutu, who chaired The Elders, which is an organization that we\u2019ve run for ten years now, he was the epitome of forgiveness with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, when Nelson Mandela took over power. I think people, nations, should all try to run based on that philosophy and the world would be a happier place if that happened. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned Nelson Mandela. This is clearly not one of my stock, rapid-fire questions, but I\u2019ve heard you refer to Nelson as a mentor. Are there any key lessons or takeaways or memorable sentences or anything that come to mind when you think of your interactions with Nelson Mandela? Richard Branson: Well, I was lucky enough to get to know him very well over the years, even to the extent, that on July the 18th we share a birthday and he would ring me every single birthday to wish me a happy birthday. I remember the sadness when I didn\u2019t get that call not so many years ago. He had an absolute joy for life. He would dance, he would smile, he would embrace everybody. But he had a tough side to him as well. I remember one lunch I had with him early on in our relationship where I\u2019d been warned that he was always trying to extract money for good causes. We had the first course, then we had the second course, then we had the pudding and we were onto the coffee and I thought, my God, I\u2019ve got away with it. Then he turns to me and says, \u201cAh, Richard, last week I had lunch with Bill Gates and he gave me $50 million for\u201d such-and-such a cause.\u201d Anyway, he did not miss an opportunity. Apart from maybe Archbishop Tutu, I haven\u2019t met anybody as extraordinary in my lifetime as him.

involved, they\u2019ll say, \u201cthere\u2019s just run", "you just run.\u201d so, knowing that we have this human nature to think of things we like as simple and things we don\u2019t as complicated, you can use this to deliberately simplify how you think of something you\u2019re avoiding, making it more appealing", "an ultramarathon is simple", "you just 100 miles to the end", "but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy, right", "so, success in business can be simple", "you just find a need that people are proving they\u2019re willing to pay for, and then find a profitable way to

simplicity in your mind", "you just jump out the door and start running", "but then notice in your results where a more simplified approach might be holding you back", "like perhaps you\u2019re using only one tool in your toolbox and you need to learn others", "as for all the business advice out there, if information was the answer, then we\u2019d all be billionaires with perfect abs", "really you, and yeah you, listening to this, most of you probably just need to shut that shit off, put your blinders on, and get out the door and start running", "metaphorically speaking, that is", "tobin: hi, this is tobin in boulder, colorado", "my question is, what should someone ask to determine their own utopia", "thanks", "first, ask yourself is this in theory or in practice", "have you proven

bucket what most people call a \u201cgrowth\u201d bucket, i call a \u201crisk growth,\u201d because it\u2019s really risk first", "on that, i\u2019m taking bigger risks for potentially greater

don\u2019t get there", "one of my constant recurring nightmares is about the stuff i passed on", "exactly", "that\u2019s what i was trying to ask", "i\u2019ve done some deals where i thought it was going to be a lot bigger and it ends up going away", "the dropbox guys, i met those guys very early on, while they were still on y combinator", "i got an early look", "i had an opportunity to do the deal and i pulled those guys aside and i said, \u201chey, look", "at google, we\u2019re using a version of this called platypus,\u201d which became g drive", "\u201cthey\u2019re going to crush you guys, man", "you should probably find some other product to pivot to.\u201d that probably costs me hundreds of millions of dollars", "did they give you a pat on the head and walk away", "no, i mean, when i see drew, the ceo of dropbox, i bring it up before he can", "that\u2019s a good self-defense maneuver", "yeah, i get it out there right away", "the airbnb guys at y combinator", "same thing", "incredible business", "an amazing business", "and one to be proud of too", "i\u2019m really jealous i\u2019m not in that business", "not just for the business, but i love what they do", "i really admire them a lot and their culture", "but at the time, they were allowing you to rent out a room in somebody\u2019s house while the owner was still there and that just seemed really scary to me", "i pulled the guys aside and i was just like, \u201cguys", "somebody\u2019s going to raped or murdered in one of the houses and the blood is going to be on your hands.\u201d i literally said that out loud to them", "what\u2019s that worth", "like $15 or $20 billion now", "now, in fairness, you\u2019re probably not wrong, right", "i mean, at a certain scale", "at scale, it has to happen", "something\u2019s going to happen", "yeah", "i like to say sometimes when you think about scale, like someone who works at walmart murdered someone last night", "there\u2019s just no doubt about it", "at that scale, with a few millions employees, one of them murdered somebody last night", "you have to look at it like edward norton fight club", "like an actuarial analysis for insurance", "which is terrifying, but that\u2019s the reality of big numbers", "there\u2019s one other famous one", "there\u2019s a bunch of these", "actually, i\u2019ll give you two", "i wasn\u2019t reminded of this until recently", "nick woodman from gopro came to google", "i wasn\u2019t an investor at the time, but i did a lot of google\u2019s investments and partnerships", "eric schmidt, ceo of google, said, \u201chey, will you come in here and sit with this pitch", "he\u2019s a friend of a friend who said we\u2019ve got to meet this guy.\u201d so, woodman comes in with gopro", "eric\u2019s like, \u201ci don\u2019t know", "i was like, \u201cwe\u2019d be foolish to do this deal", "how is this guy from santa cruz going to compete with all these asians in building hardware", "you can\u2019t hold a candle to the taiwanese and the koreans.\u201d i was like, \u201cno dice, man", "let this guy go.\u201d i think i introduced him to somebody over at youtube just as a consolation", "i saw that dude this winter skiing", "he worth like $3 or $4 billion now and he didn\u2019t forget that meeting", "then the snapshot guys", "i gave a talk in l.a", "and they came up to me", "i\u2019d never met them before", "they came up after the talk and said, \u201cwe\u2019re big fans and we\u2019d really like to work with you.\u201d i was like, \u201ceh, sure", "i mean, i know you guys are up to something cool", "i admire it.\u201d i took like eight weeks to set up the meeting and by then, the benchmark guys had done that deal", "that\u2019s, again, ohmygod, i can\u2019t imagine how much money we\u2019ve left on the table as a result of that", "i like to say when i\u2019m wrong, i\u2019m wrong and when i\u2019m right, i\u2019m really, really right", "ray dalio, @raydalio on twitter, is one of the 100 most influential people in the world, according to time and one of the 100 wealthiest people in the word, according to forbes", "because of his unique investment principles that have changed industries, cio magazine dubbed him \u201cthe steve jobs of investing.\u201d ray believes his success is the result of principles he\u2019s learned codified and applied to his life and

"so, out of your 2-bedroom apartment at 26 years old", "do you recall any of your first big wins or things that you considered big wins at the time", "i\u2019d love to just hear you describe what made those a big win", "in other words, the thinking behind it", "the funny thing is, i can hardly ever remember my big wins", "i do remember my big losses or my big mistakes", "we can talk about those too, yeah", "it\u2019s so funny because i look at it and say, well, i guess i must have had a bunch of wins or successes because of how things have went", "the business is good and done well and all of that", "but i think of my history and i really think of those mistakes", "i think that\u2019s so great because it shows that that\u2019s a much better learning tool", "okay, so my big wins", "no, i think about that time", "the things i remember were the fun things", "guys i played rugby with, and parties, and those kinds of things", "i don\u2019t remember a particularly big winning", "well, i do remember some things", "i remember one time when we got the kodak account", "again, i was in a position, it\u2019s okay, here\u2019s a guy and he\u2019s analyzing the markets and he has a small team of people", "he\u2019s analyzing the markets", "i didn\u2019t have a long track record and i didn\u2019t have an institution and i was sort of competing with the big institutions of the word \u2013 the jp morgans and everybody", "by the way, we beat them", "but anyway, what shows that the individuals, the power is with the individual", "but anyway, i remember when we got the kodak account, because at the time kodak was a big, important client", "them giving us that account was a big deal for us because it was kind of a stamp of institutional approval and it was \u2013 i remembered the money mattered too because we would know that we were a bit more financially secure", "i remember that as a big win", "i remember it so terrifically because we were asked to submit research information", "we were just a small team of people", "we stayed up all night and with pizza and beer and all of that", "i remember it so sweetly because it was the dream of making our miracle happen", "the pulling together", "that\u2019s the meaningful relationships part", "i believe that i want meaningful work and meaningful relationships", "that was what that was about", "we got the account and we won and that was a big deal", "why did you guys win", "i think it\u2019s a combination of being totally unconventional and having better processes and then there\u2019s a hell of a lot of determination", "i think three things make up a successful life, by and large", "first, you have to have audacious goals, big dreams", "then, when you are headed towards those goals, you\u2019re going to have problems", "you\u2019re going to deal with reality", "you have to deal with those problems and that reality realistically, learning from mistakes, writing down those principles and the like", "so, that\u2019s the second part", "dealing with reality in a practical way where you learn about mistakes", "then the third is the determination", "because if you\u2019re going for your goals and you\u2019re encountering your mistakes and you\u2019re learning and you do that with determination, you\u2019re going to get better all the time", "you can\u2019t help but get better", "you do that a long enough amount of time and you\u2019re going to far exceed your dreams", "my success has far exceeded what i ever imagined one bit at a time", "it\u2019s just that process", "if you were to conversely look at intelligent people who are unhappy, what do you think the primary causes of that unhappiness are", "i think it goes back to this notion of meaningful work and meaningful relationships", "intelligence and happiness probably have no correlation with each other", "in studies, it\u2019s repeatedly been shown and money is very little correlated with happiness", "the highest correlation with happiness is community", "am i part of a community", "do i feel connections with other people", "that\u2019s been literally genetically programmed into us from, it\u2019s estimated between a million and two million years ago, before we were even mankind", "so, that sense of meaningful relationships, i think, is very, very important", "if you have meaningful work, like you\u2019re on a mission, and you have meaningful relationships, i think it\u2019s almost impossible not to be happy", "there will be unhappy moments in your life that you encounter this thing or that, but the people who are unhappy seem to be missing those things", "last but certainly not least, we have sir richard branson, @richardbranson on twitter and everywhere else", "founder and chairman of the virgin group, a world-famous entrepreneur, adventurer, activist, and business icon", "he has launched a dozen billion-dollar businesses and hundreds of other companies", "i loved our conversation and highly recommend you check it out, of course", "listen to the whole thing", "but here are a few highlights you might find valuable", "you strike me as a really good negotiator", "by necessity, you\u2019d have to be", "if you had, say a would-be entrepreneur or a university senior, someone who\u2019s about to graduate and go into the real world and they tell you that they want to become a very good negotiator, a very good deal maker", "how would you train them or what would you recommend they do or read to become a better negotiator or deal maker", "because you seem very, very astute and subtle in structuring things in very smart ways", "what would you say to someone who wants to develop that skillset", "i\u2019m sure that there must be ways of being taught it, but in my operation, nothing beats personal experience", "my education was being thrown into the jungle, being thrown into the real world at age 15 or 16 and having to survive", "it was an incredible education", "i learned about everything in life", "i\u2019ve [inaudible] [00:49:09] a lot, so i\u2019ve met people all over the world", "i had to do a lot of different negotiations", "i think as i\u2019ve got older, i\u2019ve realized that one of the most important things about a negotiation is striking a deal that is fair to both sides", "i\u2019ve also realized as i get older that you\u2019ll always come across the same people time and time again in life, and so your reputation is everything", "in my new book, finding my virginity, i talk about our dealings with delta and how they felt that they\u2019d legged us over in a clause in a contract and how they came to us to rectify it", "that\u2019s something i\u2019ll never forget and most likely will be partners with delta for the rest of my life because of that kind of approach", "i think if you realize that your reputation is all you have and your personal reputation, the reputation of your brand, then you\u2019ve got to make sure that you\u2019re negotiating a deal that you\u2019re not going to be unhappy with and you think of all the things that could potentially go wrong and how you can get out of it if something goes wrong, but equally important is trying to strike a fair balance with the people you\u2019re negotiating with", "when we\u2019re looking internally, you mentioned how your teammates at the record company thought you were crazy when you brought up the airline", "are there any business ideas that you\u2019re glad your coworkers or team have prevented you from doing", "as you know, my nickname is dr", "yes", "i have books like, screw it, just do it", "to be honest, if i want to do something, one of the advantages of owning the company is i can normally get away with it", "i mean, i\u2019ll try, obviously, to carry people with me", "i\u2019m sure there have been one or two things where i have bullied the process through or i\u2019ve regretted \u2013 well, not regretted", "i\u2019ve never regretted anything", "but where perhaps i should have listened more to others", "but i can\u2019t think of anything where they persuaded me not to do it", "i think most likely, when it comes to a decision about whether to do something or not, i like to think of myself as a benevolent dictator", "that\u2019s the one thing i sort of generally get my own way on", "look, we would never have gone into space travel", "we\u2019ll come to that i\u2019m sure later on in this talk, unless i was willing to do things against the sensible", "what on paper would be sensible advice of my fellow directors", "we will definitely get to space travel", "what i\u2019m curious about, because it seems if i look at many of the businesses that you\u2019ve started, the positioning is often against a particular incumbent \u2013 in the case of airlines, for instance \u2013 that seems to be a common element in a lot of the company or product launches", "i want to connect that with some of your well-known adventures", "you\u2019ll see where this is going in a second", "you\u2019ve driven a tank down fifth avenue; crossed the english channel in an amphibious car; took a 407-jump off the palms casino resort in las vegas; gone from morocco to hawaii in a hot air balloon", "you are very adept at pr stunts, getting attention for the things that you do and the companies that you do", "are there any particular best practices or a playbook that you have found to be very \u2013 or principles, for that matter, helpful with the launching of a new company or product", "i don\u2019t think so", "i\u2019m a great believer in trying", "if you team worked really hard to launch a new business with you or for you, the least i think i can do is make a fool of myself, make sure that new business ends up on the front page of the newspapers rather than an anecdote on the last pages of the newspapers", "so, if that means having to use myself to put the new company on the map, i will do so", "i will try to do it in a way that makes people smile and that doesn\u2019t horribly backfire on me", "it hasn\u2019t usually backfired", "i suppose it\u2019s like being a host to a party", "if you\u2019re the host of the party, if you\u00a0 stand in the corner of the room and you sip your sherry and stand around with your fellow directors all in suits, everyone\u2019s going to have a thoroughly dull party and nobody will have a good time", "if you\u2019re the host of the party and you\u2019re first in the swimming pool and everybody else jumps in too, yeah, they may be a bit cold for the rest of the evening, but they\u2019re going to have a great evening", "i think the same applies when you\u2019re launching a business", "make sure that you put it on the map and just occasionally it will backfire", "you mentioned space travel, which i do want to use as a touching off point to ask you \u2013 roughly 50 years after starting your first business, why write finding my virginity", "what was the catalyst for that", "why do it", "i actually think everybody should write a book about their lives", "i\u2019ve persuaded a number of people to write books about their lives", "steve fossett, for instance", "anyway, a number of people", "you don\u2019t have to have led a very public life", "i think everyone\u2019s led interesting lives", "your children and your grandchildren will be fascinated by the lives you lead", "i wrote a book, losing my virginity, when i was a young man, about all the adventures", "it became a bestseller and sold millions of copies", "but i was quite a young man when i wrote it", "the last 20 years or so have been very full and very rich and extraordinary", "i thought i would write in a sense a sequel to losing my virginity, which we called finding my virginity", "if i life another 20 years, virginity found i suspect will be my last book", "we\u2019ll see how we go", "i think it\u2019s important", "i love reading and learning and i think others hopefully will enjoy it", "when i write books, i try not to make them like \u201cand then we did and then we did that.\u201d just try to make it a really good, gripping read and an enjoyable read and not try to prime in everything one\u2019s done in 20 years", "hopefully, people will get a few gems form it as well", "what is the book or books you\u2019ve given most as a gift and why", "outside of your own books", "are there any particular books that you\u2019ve given or recommended to others the most", "climate change is something which i\u2019ve spent a lot of time on", "i would highly recommend a book by tim flannery called the weather makers, which was one of the books that opened my eyes to the problem that we have in the world", "i\u2019m just reading homo deus, and i will carry on to read sapiens, one of his first books", "i just love the style of his writing", "i love books where you\u2019re learning something from them, rather than if i want fiction, i\u2019ll get a good film out", "if i\u2019m reading books, i like to read books which have got some substance", "in the last, let\u2019s just call it five years or so, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life or what habit has improved your life", "it could be any new belief, behavior, or habit that has markedly improved your life", "if we go back a bit further than the last five years", "we can go back as far as you like, absolutely", "one of the best things my parents taught me \u2013 i\u2019m going back a long way \u2013 if i ever said anything ill about anybody, they would sit me in front of the mirror for ten minutes in order to let me know how badly it reflected on me", "i like to think i\u2019ve never generally spoken ill about other people", "i think that\u2019s been one of the best bits of advice that i\u2019ve ever received and obviously then given", "archbishop tutu, who chaired the elders, which is an organization that we\u2019ve run for ten years now, he was the epitome of forgiveness with the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa, when nelson mandela took over power", "i think people, nations, should all try to run based on that philosophy and the world would be a happier place if that happened", "you mentioned nelson mandela", "this is clearly not one of my stock, rapid-fire questions, but i\u2019ve heard you refer to nelson as a mentor", "are there any key lessons or takeaways or memorable sentences or anything that come to mind when you think of your interactions with nelson mandela", "well, i was lucky enough to get to know him very well over the years, even to the extent, that on july the 18th we share a birthday and he would ring me every single birthday to wish me a happy birthday", "i remember the sadness when i didn\u2019t get that call not so many years ago", "he had an absolute joy for life", "he would dance, he would smile, he would embrace everybody", "but he had a tough side to him as well", "i remember one lunch i had with him early on in our relationship where i\u2019d been warned that he was always trying to extract money for good causes", "we had the first course, then we had the second course, then we had the pudding and we were onto the coffee and i thought, my god, i\u2019ve got away with it", "then he turns to me and says, \u201cah, richard, last week i had lunch with bill gates and he gave me $50 million for\u201d such-and-such a cause.\u201d anyway, he did not miss an opportunity", "apart from maybe archbishop tutu, i haven\u2019t met anybody as extraordinary in my lifetime as him"]}
