This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. This episode of The Tim Ferriss Show is not a long-form interview unless you count the multiple personalities in my own head.\u00a0 We are not talking to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Norton, Jamie Foxx, or black market biochemists, or hospice experts who have helped thousands of people die\u2014none of those things which we have done in the past.\u00a0 Josh Waitzkin, not going to be here. Instead, I am answering questions that you all or I should say many of you, wanted me to answer.\u00a0 There have been requests for me to do a Q&A, and I went onto the Facebook, www.Facebook.com/timferriss, and linked to a Reddit post where I had people submit and up-vote questions.\u00a0 At least 100 of you participated in this submitting questions, and many, many, many more up-voted the ones that you liked.\u00a0 I will take a stab at answering, I would say, somewhere between 10 and 20 questions in this short in-between-isode, shorter than my two- to three-hour interviews.\u00a0 I will infuse that with wine and water with some lemon in it. I\u2019ll give you another gear visual.\u00a0 I have my water in a hydro flask, which is 40 ounces.\u00a0 That\u2019s 1.18 liters.\u00a0 Why this particular size?\u00a0 Well, I realized when traveling in Columbia doing an AcroYoga immersive course\u2014and you can look up AcroYoga, and I suggest searching the name Jason Neemer at the same time\u2014this particular size of insulated water bottle also can be used for not foam rolling, because it\u2019s hard, but rolling out the hip flexors, quads, et cetera.\u00a0 It serves that dual purpose, so I have that in front of me. We are going to cover quite a few things, note-taking.\u00a0 We are going to cover how I view and develop particular skills, and things I\u2019m excited about in the next three to five years.\u00a0 Many of these answers are informed by the world-class experts who have been on the podcast before and things I\u2019ve learned from them, just in case you think this might be too self-indulgent. I hope you find some value in it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just jump into the questions. The first\u2014I\u2019m going to pause for dramatic drink of wine from my beaker.\u00a0 It\u2019s a beaker of sorts.\u00a0 It\u2019s 250 mL KIMAX Kimble beaker.\u00a0 I first saw these types of glasses at Flower and Water, a restaurant here in San Francisco that\u2019s outstanding.\u00a0 I\u2019m actually involved with a sister restaurant called Central Kitchen.\u00a0 Why would I find this interesting?\u00a0 Number one, I like giving people beakers in my house to drink wine from because they all put on funny faces expecting that I\u2019ve stored blood, urine, or something else in it.\u00a0 Two-hundred-fifty milliliters, also, I enjoy measuring things.\u00a0 That is exactly one-third of a standard bottle of wine, 750 mL.\u00a0 Pause for a sip, and I hope you\u2019re all having a lovely day wherever you are, or evening.\u00a0 Hold on. Oh, so delicious.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Here we go.\u00a0 First question and I\u2019m not going to read off the names of the people who submitted these just in case I criticize the questions.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 The first question is if you were to do a zero to hero transformation of someone, what would be the path you would take?\u00a0 I\u2019m speaking about business as well as health. Now let me begin my answer with a story.\u00a0 Then I\u2019ll take a stab at answering this.\u00a0 I recall after graduating from college\u2014this was 2000 or so\u2014I moved to Silicon Valley and ended up getting a very low-paying job in technical sales for a mass data storage company, storage area networking company.\u00a0 There was a mentor to the CEO of this company.\u00a0 It was a very young CEO, very capable, about 23 or 25 years old. This mentor was one of the highest-ranking executives at a company called Brocade.\u00a0 He was looked at and viewed with reverence and awe by many people in the company.\u00a0 I remember at one point getting into the elevator going down at the same time as he was ending a meeting with the CEO, so we ended up in the elevator together, and we struck up a conversation and ended up having an email exchange about philosophies of life, basically.\u00a0 I tried to keep it very succinct.\u00a0 I knew that if I abused the opportunity to communicate with him, I would lose that immediately.\u00a0 At the same time, I was eager to learn as much as possible from him. Now flash forward a month or two.\u00a0 I shot him an email that ended the communication.\u00a0 That email asked two questions, in effect.\u00a0 What should I do to become successful, and something along the lines of, \u201cHere I am.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing this, this, and this.\u00a0 What should I do with my life?\u201d Here\u2019s the problem with those two questions, and in a way, the question that was asked.\u00a0 You have to fit the question to the format, particularly when dealing with someone who has a lot going on.\u00a0 He responded prettily angrily, at least from the way I read the tone with, \u201cWhat do you expect me to do with these questions?\u00a0 These are not good questions.\u00a0 I can\u2019t answer them,\u201d because it would take him hours and hours just to clarify exactly what we mean by, for instance in this one, zero to hero.\u00a0 Hero for what?\u00a0 How do we objectively or subjectively define success? All right.\u00a0 But let me take a stab at this, just underscoring the importance of asking questions that fit the format and fit the person\u2019s bandwidth.\u00a0 You see this a lot in Q&As where questions are posed which are not necessarily bad questions, but they\u2019re somewhat imprecise and cannot be answered in the time allocated. Here we go.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what I would do.\u00a0 I hate to presuppose people have read my books who are listening to the podcast, but the fact of the matter is that I\u2019ve answered a lot of this before, so I would assign reading.\u00a0 In this particular order, this is what came to mind as I was having dinner earlier. I would have them read The Magic of Thinking Big by David J Schwartz.\u00a0 This is a book that\u2019s actually on my bookshelf facing out, so I\u2019m reminded of it constantly.\u00a0 Next, I would have them read The Four-Hour Workweek written by yours truly. Next I would have them read The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker, probably the best book or almost certainly the best book I\u2019ve ever read on productivity, really with a focus by necessity on being effective, doing the right things, and not efficiency, doing things well because you can do a lot of unimportant or meaningless things extremely quickly and well.\u00a0 That does not make them important, and it will never make them important. Okay, The Effective Executive.\u00a0 Next How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Mr.\u00a0 Carnegie.\u00a0 I believe that that covers the major bases.\u00a0 In terms of getting someone on the path from zero to here on business.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 There you have it. The next is health for our body, I think the book that was written to answer that question.\u00a0 The short synopsis would be number-one, create accountability through some type of betting circle.\u00a0 I think money is an easy tool to use in this case, so get together with four or five friends.\u00a0 Put in $100 each, for instance.\u00a0 Whoever loses the most body fat in the next X number of months\u2014make a specific date\u2014gets the entire pool and bragging rights, and shit-talking rights, of course. This accomplishes some very interesting things.\u00a0 I won\u2019t delve into the behavioral psychology aspects of this, but this is an incentive.\u00a0 Ultimately, you\u2019re only as loyal as your incentives.\u00a0 I hate to say that, but it\u2019s true.\u00a0 Self-control is overrated.\u00a0 You need a stick or a carrot, and this provides both.\u00a0 The fear and consequences of losing money, which is actually a greater motivator than that of gaining money, and then social accountability.\u00a0 Create a betting circle or something like that.\u00a0 You can use tools like www.Coach.me, which is a site, www.StickK.com, and others, www.DietBet.com, for instance.\u00a0 But create a betting circle, number one. Number-two is focus on diet.\u00a0 Ninety-nine percent of fat loss is diet mediating.\u00a0 You cannot out-exercise your mouth.\u00a0 For those people who have a lot of weight to lose, or just want to lose weight effectively, I say do not add any new exercise.\u00a0 Focus on diet for at least the first four to eight weeks.\u00a0 That would be the slow-carb diet with one cheat day as prescribed in The Four-Hour Body. You can just search \u201cslow carb diet\u201d and find all the basics, or \u201chow to lose 100 pounds on the slow carb diet\u201d with a bunch of case studies, which is on the blog. Next, if you\u2019re going to add exercise, I would suggest two-handed kettlebell swings in one set of 50 to 75 reps if possible.\u00a0 You can break that up into multiple sets if you cannot hit the target of 75 reps.\u00a0 You do that once or twice per week.\u00a0 Search for a blog post called, I think it is, \u201cCreating the Perfect Posterior,\u201d which has demo videos and explains exactly how to do this. You can build a kettlebell very cheaply with basic supplies from a plumbing store.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the T-bar handle or the T-bar kettlebell swings.\u00a0 You can search for that as well. On off days, walk for at least one hour.\u00a0 That would be my recommendation. Last but not least, meditate.\u00a0 You can take a transcendental meditation course as I did, or you can practice vipassana, mindfulness insight mediation, et cetera, or just use, as I would recommend to most people, an app like Headspace, and practice for 10 minutes in the morning for 10 days straight.\u00a0 That is my attempt at answering that very broad question. Next and this is ancillary, if you were tasked with building a person from a blank slate, a la Frankenstein\u2019s creature or an android, what skills, qualities, would you give him first?\u00a0 I will tell you. Number-one, I\u2019m just thinking of building a terminator here.\u00a0 Number-one would be the ability to build\u2014assuming they have biological requirements.\u00a0 They\u2019re not just made of metal and computational components, so they actually need food, et cetera, and are susceptible to cold and whatnot.\u00a0 I would teach them how to build or find shelter because the rule of threes would dictate\u2014and this is in The Four-Hour Chef for people who want to really go off the rails with survivalist stuff. You can survive.\u00a0 The guideline is in harsh conditions or changing conditions, you can survive without shelter for three hours.\u00a0 You can survive without water for three days.\u00a0 You can survive without food for three weeks.\u00a0 Food is not the highest priority despite all the sensationalist bullshit television shows you might watch.\u00a0 You just don\u2019t need food, really, for a very long time.\u00a0 So shelter, number one.\u00a0 The next would be the ability to ask good questions.\u00a0 That would be along the lines of Cal Fussman who was interviewed on this podcast, the best interviewer I have ever met in my life who has interviewed every celebrity imaginable for Esquire magazine for the \u201cWhat I\u2019ve Learned\u201d column.\u00a0 This ranges from Mohammad Ali to Gorbachev to presidents.\u00a0 It just goes down the list\u2014Johnny Depp\u2014everybody you can possibly imagine. Way back in the day when he was paying his\u2014well, not really paying his way.\u00a0 I should say befriending his way across Europe and around the world, he didn\u2019t have a lot of budget, and he would find free places to stay by, say, walking down a train, sitting next to a grandmother, and ultimately asking her how to make, say, the best borscht, depending on the location.\u00a0 Pick your regional soup.\u00a0 \u201cHow do you make a really good borscht?\u201d\u00a0 It would end two hours later with, \u201cYou need to come.\u00a0 You stay with my family.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to make you borscht.\u201d\u00a0 So the ability to ask good questions is really the ability to think clearly.\u00a0 If you think about the underlying process of conscious thought, it is really one of asking and answering questions, so the ability to ask good questions.\u00a0 Maybe last, I would say the ability to identify or find people, powerful people, in times of crisis.\u00a0 This is a weird one, but it came to mind earlier. That is a window of opportunity to crack through the noise as a signal if you have something to offer, and develop relationships that would otherwise be above your paygrade or social stature. Next, how do you build rapport with your podcast guests?\u00a0 For the most part, the conversations flow well, and your guests are very open with you.\u00a0 I would love some tips I can implement to build that type of rapport with people. All right, there are a few things.\u00a0 Number one, making someone comfortable with a conversation or, in this case, an interview, starts before the interview.\u00a0 A big part of that is making it clear to them this is not a \u201cgotcha\u201d interview, and you have final cut. This is what they do with \u201cInside the Actors Studio,\u201d which I learned by hiring a researcher who had worked with the team and Lipton at \u201cInside the Actors Studio.\u201d\u00a0 They say you have final cut.\u00a0 What does that mean?\u00a0 That means if you say anything embarrassing or you say anything you regret, we can cut it out before it goes live, and you have the ability to make those cuts. I always encourage people to be as raw and detailed as possible.\u00a0 We can always cut it out afterwards.\u00a0 We can\u2019t add it in afterwards. Then you have social proof at one point where I say, \u201cYour friends A, B, C, D, and E have been on the podcast,\u201d or \u201cA and B,\u201d or just A.\u00a0 \u201cFeel free to chat with them.\u00a0 This is a friendly podcast with an incredibly huge impact with the demographic that I can describe,\u201d and then go on.\u00a0 You have to sell the show and the importance of being candid and raw. Then I will do a few things to make them comfortable.\u00a0 Number one is I will oftentimes\u2014not always\u2014send them the rapid-fire questions that I ask at the end of the podcast in advance because I want them to have good answers.\u00a0 You, the audience, want them to have good answers, and it still keeps it fresh for me, but it gives them a layer of comfort.\u00a0 Even if two-thirds of the interview is spontaneous, they have something they know they can knock out of the park if they take 10 minutes to think about it beforehand. Then there are probably 20 more things, but I\u2019ll just give you two more.\u00a0 At least 10 minutes of pre-interview talk, so call and actually talk to them for a period of time before you start the interview.\u00a0 You don\u2019t want to jump immediately into it if you can avoid that.\u00a0 The way you elicit vulnerability is by being vulnerable yourself. I hope it does not seem like I\u2019m trying to monopolize conversations when I interview people for the podcast, but a very important component of making them feel comfortable enough to provide stories, tactics, et cetera that people have never heard before is being forthcoming with my own stories of vulnerability or things that they wouldn\u2019t expect me to share in an interview, and they reciprocate in kind. Those are a few things, and that\u2014by the way\u2014a number of those, I picked up from Neil Strauss, a seven- or eight-time The New York Times bestselling author but also an incredible interviewer who has written a lot for The New York Times and Rolling Stone. Next, this is a multi-parter.\u00a0 You crafty little devils and your multi-bulleted questions.\u00a0 Here we go.\u00a0 Expand more on your teens and 20s.\u00a0 What were you doing?\u00a0 What type of person were you?\u00a0 What were your influences?\u00a0 I\u2019m just going to cut it short and say I was a wrestler.\u00a0 I think that sports should be mandatory in elementary school and high school, as they were at the second high school I went to, which was a spectacular school called Saint Paul\u2019s in New Hampshire.\u00a0 I went from a bad public high school in Long Island to a very, very tough boarding school in New Hampshire, school six days a week, mandatory sports, chapel almost every morning, seated meal with coat and tie, like Dead Poets Society style, and on and on. It really kicked my ass, which was great.\u00a0 But I wanted to say that sports, I think, enabled you to inoculate yourself against fear and failure because you are constantly delivered small doses of both, and you have to contend with them in a sports arena where success is objectively determined.\u00a0 I think this is a real godsend and gift.\u00a0 It is a form in which you can practice and condition yourself to be more effective in every area of life. Two large influences, one in person, John Buxton who is my wrestling coach and coached some incredible people that went on to do amazing things, like Charles Best who is founder of www.DonorsChoose.org, which you guys should all check out. The other mentor who I\u2019ve actually come to know a bit now in person\u2014which is amazing.\u00a0 I actually watched the Olympic trials in Iowa with him a few weeks ago\u2014Dan Gable.\u00a0 There was a video called \u201cCompetitor Supreme\u201d about Dan Gable that I must have watched 100 times. I will leave it at that, but everyone should watch it.\u00a0 It might be a dude thing.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, but high emphasis on aggression, determination, grit, et cetera.\u00a0 Certainly there is no gender-specific requirement for grit and resilience.\u00a0 That goes across the board, and I hope to explore that actually in the new future with a female author and scientist who has written a book titled Grit, but we\u2019ll come back to that. All right.\u00a0 Do you believe that you or people in general have personal callings?\u00a0 Do you believe that circumstances are designed so that we have an approximate or ideal life path? Well, I have a few, perhaps, contradictory answers to this.\u00a0 The first answer is no.\u00a0 Well, no-asterisk.\u00a0 That means that most people will not immediately know what their calling is.\u00a0 Now if you\u2019re Tiger Woods, and you\u2019re drawing trajectories of different irons when you\u2019re 6 or 7 years old, okay.\u00a0 You have been selected by the universe to specialize.\u00a0 I think that can be a gift. It can be a curse, of course, as all these things are.\u00a0 For most folks, you can have many different vocations, callings, or purposes throughout your life.\u00a0 Certainly that is how I feel personally.\u00a0 At one point, I read\u2014I think this was actually a [inaudible] of some type\u2014and I\u2019m paraphrasing this.\u00a0 It stated roughly that your calling is looking for you. This has been a very big shift for me in the last two or three years that has taken the pressure off but actually allowed me to get a lot more done simultaneously.\u00a0 That is throwing the entire paradigm of you need to find your calling, you need to find your passion, on its head.\u00a0 Look at it through the lens of your calling is looking for you.\u00a0 All you need to do is create space and openness in this entangled universe. Ultimately, like two balls in a pinball machine\u2014I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s actually the right metaphor, but\u2014you will encounter this.\u00a0 You have to have the presence of mind to recognize it when it appears or presents itself.\u00a0 I do believe that developing practices of mindfulness, like using, for instance, an app in the morning to meditate for 10 to 20 minutes for seven to 10 days straight to develop that habit. Other related tools, whether that\u2019s simple gratitude journaling exercises or flotation tanks will enable you to see opportunities and callings that are right in front of you and perhaps have been in front of you for a very long time.\u00a0 That has been, at least, my approach. Do I believe in coincidences is the next one?\u00a0 In reviewing data, yes. \u00a0In other words, there are a lot of spurious relationships you can observe in massive data sets or in scientific studies, and people convince themselves of causality, i.e.\u00a0 A causes B when it is just chance.\u00a0 You have to understand a little bit of statistics to really crunch that properly, but in reviewing data, yes.\u00a0 I believe in coincidences.\u00a0 There are a lot of folks who will torture the data to get all sorts of conclusions out of the data, which may be popular, i.e.\u00a0 The China study, but not in any respect defensible or accurate. You can go back to the original monograph for that or look at the long-term implications of cancer from, for instance, purely plant-based diets and so on that have come up recently.\u00a0 This is to say also, guys, don\u2019t assume an agenda.\u00a0 I\u2019m not part of the pro-meat lobby.\u00a0 I\u2019m reviewing the data.\u00a0 On either side or any side, do I believe in coincidences?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Absolutely when reviewing data.\u00a0 In life generally, if we\u2019re talking about at the 30,000-foot level, I find it enabling, and there are people who take issue with this.\u00a0 I think I sometimes take issue with this. I find it helpful\u2014and this is borrowed from Tony Robbins who has said this\u2014to believe that life is happening for me, not to me.\u00a0 A consequence of that is when shitty things happen, I view it as an opportunity to train myself, or I view it as what is needed to happen for me to learn a particular lesson.\u00a0 I suppose that would mean that I am ruling out coincidence.\u00a0 I am looking for purpose or reason behind these things that happen, whether they are good, bad, or neutral. All right.\u00a0 Next bullet.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to skip one on cryonics because I don\u2019t have a strong opinion, although \u201cWait, But Why?\u201d has a good article on it.\u00a0 What is something you are increasingly getting excited about or is just on your radar, something you might be really into in the next three to five years. There are a few things: getting very much into gymnastic strength training.\u00a0 Specifically, I\u2019m being helped by a guy named Coach Sommer who has a company called Gymnastic Bodies.\u00a0 AcroYoga, and I mentioned this earlier.\u00a0 I\u2019m increasingly excited about it because it has certain facets of tango, which of course I fell in love with long ago in Argentina. I went to the world championships in 2005.\u00a0 Those include physical contact that is sensual but not necessarily sexual, play, and improvisation.\u00a0 These three components I find very medicinal and therapeutic, and it\u2019s just fucking fun, and you get in fantastic shape if you don\u2019t tear your adductors first, as a base.\u00a0 That is so you guys can look it up.\u00a0 AcroYoga, check it. On a business standpoint, or not just a business standpoint but opportunity standpoint, fascination standpoint, economic standpoint, there are two that jump out.\u00a0 The first is virtual reality.\u00a0 I was a virtual reality skeptic until I had the Valve software demo on and HTCV headset, and I think it\u2019s going to change everything. Virtual reality is in the Model T stage at best, and I think in the next five years it will revolutionize entertainment.\u00a0 It\u2019ll revolutionize training for skills like surgery.\u00a0 It will revolutionize porn certainly, just to name the huge elephant in the room.\u00a0 I mean, the tactile feedback potential.\u00a0 Eye scanning startups and specializing.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be completely bonkers, so there\u2019s that. The next is \u2013 and this is something I only recently got a full appreciation of two nights ago at dinner at Central Kitchen, which I mentioned, with a gent named David Norris.\u00a0 David Norris is the CEO of a company called MD Insider.\u00a0 You guys should check out MD Insider.\u00a0 It\u2019s highly disruptive.\u00a0 Full disclosure, I am an investor in this company.\u00a0 He was explaining to me the shift from something called fee for service model to value model with health insurance. The way I would introduce this is by asking how big a deal would it be if every single automotive company simultaneously decided they were going to stop using gasoline.\u00a0 They were all going electric or all going to an alternative fuel source or energy source?\u00a0 It would be front-page news in every newspaper.\u00a0 The same thing, effectively, is happening in healthcare right now. That is that instead of saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay this premium, and then when you get sick, we\u2019re going to pay out these incredible fees for these various things.\u00a0 Instead what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to charge you a premium, and then it\u2019s our job to keep you healthy.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m vastly simplifying this and drinking wine, so I\u2019m going to let you look up fee for service to value for healthcare.\u00a0 This is a multi, multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. It\u2019s just unbelievable.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fucking free for all.\u00a0 It\u2019s the Wild West right now, so that\u2019s very exciting.\u00a0 In that type of chaos, you find a lot of opportunity for smart people who can think orthogonally.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 There you go. Next, dogs.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about them.\u00a0 I get a lot of questions about dogs because I have Molly who\u2019s lying on the floor next to me right now and is 11 months old.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had her for roughly seven months.\u00a0 A couple of questions related to dogs. Why did you get one, especially as someone who values flexibility and freedom?\u00a0 Well, I will tell you.\u00a0 I think flexibility and freedom can be a fool\u2019s errand.\u00a0 I\u2019ll illustrate it with a story.\u00a0 I was having a conversation with a very close friend of mine, who has a successful business with millions of dollars, and he always had ruled out decisions that would limit his travel, limit his options, and he viewed himself as the guy who was independent.\u00a0 He worked for his freedom to be an entrepreneur until he realized he had a high degree of stress from infinite options. He needed positive constraints, as I do.\u00a0 Infinite options equals ultimate prison in many circumstances.\u00a0 You end up with this paradox of choices.\u00a0 It\u2019s like standing in front of shelving at a Safeway with 300 brands of toothpaste and just wasting 15 minutes of your life just trying to pick a fucking toothpaste.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need that type of cognitive burden and decision fatigue. Why did I get one?\u00a0 Because I always felt incomplete without a dog.\u00a0 That might sound pitiful.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s just being honest.\u00a0 I grew up with two rescues, and there is something in my DNA that just matches with canines, number-one.\u00a0 I wanted to care for something outside myself. Now you would say that infringes on my freedom.\u00a0 On the other hand, you could argue that when I am miserable, I am miserable because of a me focus, and the remedy to that is precisely doing something which is infringing on my freedom, my options, but is a positive constraint that improves my wellbeing and contentedness, which is having something like a dog that I need to keep alive.\u00a0 That is another piece of it. Next question: training tips.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 I will probably write something more elaborate on this in the future.\u00a0 Number-one, look into crate training.\u00a0 I think Ian Dunbar has quite a bit that is good on this.\u00a0 Clicker training, use a clicker.\u00a0 This is basically a positive reinforcement tool that has been refined with a whistle or a clicker in marine training with dolphins and so on.\u00a0 You can use it for dogs.\u00a0 It speeds everything up dramatically. The best book that touches on this and many other principles\u2014and there\u2019s a lot of bullshit in the dog training world\u2014is [Don\u2019t]\u00a0Shoot the Dog by Karen Pryor.\u00a0 She is very legit.\u00a0 Terrible title.\u00a0 Fantastic book.\u00a0 Even if you care not one iota about dog training, for human training, if you want to get your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, if you want to get the cat off the table, if you want to negotiate with your kid to get them to do something, this is a great book, so check out [Don\u2019t]\u00a0Shoot the Dog. Next tip for training is train for attention.\u00a0 This means training your dog to at least engage in eye contact and check in with you regularly when you give specific cues.\u00a0 If you search for \u201cthe most important skill to teach your dog Ferriss,\u201d I put up a short video demonstrating how I do this with my dog using a clicker.\u00a0 It\u2019s very easy to do and pays incredible dividends. That alone allows me to go to most dog parks and have people comment on how my dog is the best-behaved or trained there.\u00a0 It is a cheat, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is of any less value.\u00a0 It\u2019s a prerequisite for all the other types of skills you\u2019d want to layer on top of that, so train for attention.\u00a0 Check out that video, the most important skill to teach your dog, and then my last name. A few other things, depending on how old or young the dog is.\u00a0 Expose them to many different surfaces and many different people, ages, gender, race, et cetera.\u00a0 Surface is very important if you\u2019re going to travel with your dog a lot, which I do.\u00a0 Grates, sand, grass, AstroTurf, carpet, et cetera.\u00a0 You want to expose them to as much as possible.\u00a0 If your dog freaks out about something, which mine did for a long time with certain types of sliding doors and entryways. Take a Temple Grandin approach.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have time to get into who that is, but crouch down to the eye level of your dog, and check things out.\u00a0 Don\u2019t assume they see the exact same thing, but it will give you some improved perspective. Let\u2019s see.\u00a0 What breed is Molly?\u00a0 Why\u2019d you pick that?\u00a0 She is a rescue mutt. \u00a0I have no idea.\u00a0 I did a genetic test with a company that I am convinced is a complete scam.\u00a0 They basically sent me a cover sheet that said, \u201cCongratulations. You have a dog.\u00a0 It might be one of these 20 breeds, and here are 30 pages stolen from Wikipedia on genetics. Congratulations.\u201d But she looks a lot like an [inaudible], which is a short-haired herding dog that looks like a Bernese mountain dog, closely related.\u00a0 That is that.\u00a0 I believe in supporting no-kill dog shelters whenever possible, so I adopted her. What have you learned about human behavior from Molly?\u00a0 I have learned the drive to be right or righteous is often counterproductive.\u00a0 What I mean by that is you should focus on positive reinforcement whenever possible.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have time to get into why that\u2019s the case, although there is a book.\u00a0 It\u2019s very hard to find. I\u2019m fantasizing about buying the rights and giving it away for free as a PDF to the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s called Command Performance, which is a compilation of training tips from Whole Dog Journal.\u00a0 I\u2019m not making this up.\u00a0 It\u2019s great.\u00a0 It\u2019s very short.\u00a0 Most dog training books are 99 percent bullshit subjective made-up nonsense and then a handful of tactical things.\u00a0 This is all tactical.\u00a0 Maybe one behavior every three pages for 100 pages.\u00a0 It\u2019s great. But looking at the flipside of that, negative reinforcement or punishment, so let\u2019s just say you come home and your dog shit on the floor.\u00a0 Guess what.\u00a0 This is going to happen, if you get a puppy especially, or whatever it might be. At some point, your dog\u2019s going to make a mistake.\u00a0 If you, let\u2019s say, come across it, and you don\u2019t know when it happened, but you\u2019re pissed, and you want to make a point of teaching your dog that this is the wrong thing to do, in your mind.\u00a0 This is how you\u2019re going about rationalizing what you do next, which is, let\u2019s say, grabbing the dog by the collar, and putting their head right next to it, and saying, \u201cNo.\u00a0 Bad dog.\u00a0 Bad dog.\u201d\u00a0 Well, guess what.\u00a0 If this dog didn\u2019t take the shit right in front of you, they\u2019re not going to connect not crapping in the house.\u00a0 They will perhaps conclude that they shouldn\u2019t go to the bathroom where you can find it, so they\u2019ll just go in the closet and take a dump on your shoes instead. The point being it pays to study behavioral conditioning, operant in classical conditioning, and you\u2019ll realize that very often, being right or righteous and disciplining your dog is not effective.\u00a0 It just is not effective, and this translates to interacting with other humans, of course, because we are mammals.\u00a0 Whether you\u2019re prodding a slug with a little electrode and looking at operate conditioning and Ebbinghaus forgetting curves and so on, it\u2019s the same shit.\u00a0 We like to think of ourselves as very fancy creatures, but the fact of the matter is you can condition human begins to do fantastic things or atrocious things very easily by understanding operant and classical conditionings.\u00a0 Conditioning is no different, which is why [Don\u2019t] Shoot the Dog is such a great book for understanding how to modify behavior, your own and other people or species.\u00a0 There you have it. All right.\u00a0 Explain why you avoid feeding fowl to your dog.\u00a0 I\u2019ve looked but can\u2019t find the reason.\u00a0 This is a simple reason.\u00a0 It might not be a good one.\u00a0 I had a very good chef and food scientist tell me to avoid fowl.\u00a0 I asked him why, and he said, \u201cBecause they\u2019re fucking disgusting.\u201d Two weeks later, there was a recall on the same brand of food that I bought my dog, but there was a recall on the duck and chicken, on the fowl.\u00a0 It just seems like there are higher incidences of food contamination, but I could be investing that. All right.\u00a0 Next question.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to go for another 10 or 15 minutes.\u00a0 \u201cHey, Tim.\u00a0 You might have covered this previously, but I\u2019m really interested to hear how you met and became friends with Kevin Rose.\u00a0 Kevin Rose I met through Aubrey Sabala, Aubs.\u00a0 How you doing?\u00a0 Thanks for that. I threw a party on the SS Jeremiah, which is a working warship that is docked in San Francisco.\u00a0 They recorded a lot of the sound for Titanic on the SS Jeremiah.\u00a0 It is a functioning homeland security vessel.\u00a0 They have weaponry and everything up on deck, but you can rent out one of the cargo rooms for parties, so I threw this Hunt for Red October theme party with red lights everywhere, and Aubrey was coming, and she asked me if she could bring her friend, Kevin Rose. Kevin came, and we hit it off.\u00a0 Over the period of maybe six months, we got to know each other.\u00a0 Shazam.\u00a0 There you have it.\u00a0 Kevin, for those people who don\u2019t know, was also Episode1 of \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Show,\u201d which at that time did not have a name.\u00a0 He wanted to call it \u201cTim Tim Talk Talk\u201d which some people still fucking call it.\u00a0 Thank you, Kevin. All right.\u00a0 Next.\u00a0 If you were to go back to college, what would you choose to major in and why?\u00a0 It can be for personal reasons or fiscal reasons.\u00a0 I assume you would choose not to go at all, but let\u2019s say you had to.\u00a0 That deserves another sip of wine.\u00a0 Bear with me, folks.\u00a0 Oh, so delicious. Well, you assumed incorrectly.\u00a0 I would go to college.\u00a0 I think that despite the dropout fetishizing we have in the U.S., there is still a fantastic place for college, and that is for two reasons.\u00a0 Number one, I view the objective of a liberal arts education, if that is what we\u2019re talking about, as creating a well-rounded human being\u2014well-rounded and open-minded human being, not preparing someone, as would be the case in a specialty professional school, for one industry or profession. That being the case, I will say this and bite my tongue at the same time.\u00a0 Number one, many of the people I know who have done very well financially but have not gone to college carry with them an insecurity about that for the rest of their life, for their entire lives.\u00a0 They will open up about this with close friends after a few glasses of wine. The second and more important piece is that I\u2019ve met many people who talk a lot of trash about going to college.\u00a0 They did not go themselves, and they are very successful financially, and extremely one-dimensional.\u00a0 They are great at crafting deals, negotiating, and they know absolutely fuck-all about anything outside of that realm.\u00a0 This is not universal.\u00a0 There are some incredible exceptions, but this is very common. I would absolutely still go to college, but I would say the value of that from a professional or career standpoint is\u2014well, there are two different strata we can talk about.\u00a0 I think that if you\u2019re not a Zuckerberg\u2014and lets\u2019 face it.\u00a0 Most of us are not\u2014then having college graduate on your resume will help you to achieve a guaranteed level of income above the norm that will be very hard to come by if you are not an entrepreneur who is a Zuckerberg. The second is much like MBA programs, people ask me, \u201cIs it worth it going to an MBA program?\u201d\u00a0 I say, \u201cWell, it depends on your goals and it depends on the school.\u00a0 If you go to, say, a top 10 school or a top 50 school, undergraduate, it can certainly be worth it.\u201d\u00a0 If you go to a Harvard, or Princeton, or Stanford, that is a golden ticket in many different worlds, so it is worth it. So now I\u2019m going to get off my soap box about college.\u00a0 Can you educate yourself well without it?\u00a0 Yes, but it takes someone who is self-directed or disciplined enough to do that through cultivation by parents or through conditioning and self-development. Next, what would I major in?\u00a0 I would major in what I majored in when I went to school, which was East Asian studies.\u00a0 I think you should focus on obsessions and communication.\u00a0 That has served me very well in life, so I\u2019m perhaps speaking from a limited personal experience, but I was never encouraged to take a technical path. It might have been terrible even if I had been encouraged, so I\u2019m not going to say computer science because that is the way of the future, and if you don\u2019t code, you\u2019re not going to be literate, and you\u2019re fucked.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to say that.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to say you should focus on your obsessions because if you\u2019re not obsessed, if you don\u2019t have that excitement, you\u2019re not going to be any better than mediocre in any field, in my opinion. And communication because you\u2019re going to require that no matter what.\u00a0 You are going to have to have a clear ability to communicate verbally and in the written word.\u00a0 That could mean English.\u00a0 It could mean any number of things.\u00a0 Writing courses with extremely merciless teachers are also very helpful.\u00a0 There you have it. What do I think about going to school aboard?\u00a0 I know Tim lived in Germany.\u00a0 Yeah, I think it should be mandatory for one year, ideally in 10th grade.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have time to go into that right now, but I\u2019ll leave it at that. A bunch of questions about note-taking.\u00a0 I will just say I am note-taking fiend.\u00a0 I have what I would call hypergraphia, which is compulsive note-taking tendencies.\u00a0 To keep this short, search for a blog post called \u201cHow to Take Notes Like an Alpha Geek.\u201d\u00a0 I really dig into it there.\u00a0 You can also see photographs of some of my notes that I put on Instagram, www.Instragram.com/timferriss. But there was a specific question about what deserves highlighting?\u00a0 Do you use any made-up abbreviations or symbols?\u00a0 Yes, I do.\u00a0 I will go through.\u00a0 I will take notes in books.\u00a0 If I put \u201cph\u201d next to it, that means \u201cphrase.\u201d\u00a0 That means I like the wording, the wordsmithing of a line.\u00a0 \u201cQ\u201d or \u201cQu\u201d means \u201cquote.\u201d\u00a0 I like the quote.\u00a0 Then I will underline things and highlight things. I create an index at the front of the book if we\u2019re talking about print.\u00a0 I will create basically a table of contents with different topics and the page numbers to the left.\u00a0 They do not need to be in order from start to finish.\u00a0 They can be all out of order.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m looking at the topic and then jumping to the page number. In some cases, I\u2019ll just put \u201cph,\u201d remember those phrases, and then I\u2019ll write down all of the page numbers for the phrase, the turns of phrase that I like. Now, this is the critical piece.\u00a0 When I go through a second time\u2014because some folks have said highlighting in my own notes always seems random.\u00a0 I hope this was important until my highlighting basically means nothing.\u00a0 The way I get around that is when I do multiple passes of a book.\u00a0 If a book is worth reading once and it\u2019s non-fiction, it should be worth reading twice or three times.\u00a0 Otherwise, it\u2019s not worth reading once. I will go through multiple passes looking at my highlights, and I will put T1, T2, T3, T4 on each of these passes.\u00a0 What does this mean?\u00a0 I\u2019ll underline highlighted stuff.\u00a0 Then I will go back and review those highlights.\u00a0 If I still think it\u2019s worth highlighting, I\u2019ll put T2. I will often date this in my index.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say, \u201cAll right.\u00a0 April, 2016, T2.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s when I went through and did T2.\u00a0 Then if I go through again six months later, I will only look at the T2s and put T3.\u00a0 This is how I keep track of these revisions. Let\u2019s see.\u00a0 We\u2019re about 46 minutes in.\u00a0 Holy fuck, people.\u00a0 I am long-winded.\u00a0 Am I long-winded?\u00a0 Such insecurities.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to hit a few more, and then I\u2019m going to call it a night. Next we have slow carb diet.\u00a0 As a 40-plus male on the slow carb diet, I\u2019m very interested in understanding a few things.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard a lot about ketogenesis.\u00a0 I\u2019m interested if this process relates to the slow carb diet.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t think about it.\u00a0 Ketogenesis and ketogenic diet is much harder to follow.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t succeeded already on the slow carb diet, I would not go directly to ketosis.\u00a0 If you want to learn a lot about it, you can read a book called Keto Clarity, which is a good introduction, or listen to the podcast I did with Dominic D\u2019Agostino, an incredible scientist. Suffice to say, I would say if you have a lot of weight to lose and if you\u2019re 40-plus, I would focus on the slow carb diet first. How much does falling off the wagon or extending your cheat day affect the results of your slow carb diet?\u00a0 Just get back on the horse, number one.\u00a0 Number two, if you extend your cheat day, you will significantly impact your gains, meaning losses.\u00a0 So stick to one wake cycle whenever possible.\u00a0 That means don\u2019t stay up on a Friday if your cheat day is Saturday, as it is for me and many people, hence the nickname fatter-day.\u00a0 Do not stay up until midnight, cheat for four hours, then go to bed at 4:00 a.m., wake up in the middle of the day, and then cheat for another 24 hours.\u00a0 That will fuck you up.\u00a0 One wake cycle.\u00a0 That means that you wake up.\u00a0 You start cheating.\u00a0 You cheat, cheat, cheat, and then you end when you go to bed, and that\u2019s it. Can it be beneficial to start the slow carb with a period of no cheat day, and what are the pros and cons?\u00a0 Yes, you can do that.\u00a0 Some people have benefited from that.\u00a0 Most people, 90 percent, will benefit from the psychological release valve and the hyper chloric spike, which helps with thyroid and whatnot, if a cheat day.\u00a0 If you know thyself, and you are going to fly of the rails and not be able to regain it or get back on the rails, then you could avoid a cheat day for the first few weeks.\u00a0 I, for most people, still recommend it. There\u2019s a note here then.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve pushed too hard several times and injured my back and knee with two intensive an exercise, which is why I\u2019ve tried slow carb diet four times.\u00a0 This time I\u2019m trying to stick to the diet as close as possible and only do light walks every day. \u201cPeople do not realize that if you eat a lot of sugar, live on a diet of cookies and milk, pies and ice cream, your body does not like it when you stop it, and it messes with your head.\u00a0 Sometimes even if I\u2019m not physically hungry, I still have an immense desire to eat Oreos and drink a little milk.\u201d A few things.\u00a0 Yes, if you are focusing on weight loss, focus on diet exclusively for the first four to eight weeks.\u00a0 Do not add exercise.\u00a0 This will increase your likelihood of failing, and you will, as a big person\u2014and look.\u00a0 Let\u2019s call a spade a spade.\u00a0 People talk about fat-shaming.\u00a0 That\u2019s bullshit.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t try to help other people or yourself who are obese, you are complicit in killing them.\u00a0 Fat-shaming, go fuck yourself.\u00a0 I want to help people first and foremost, and what that means is we have to be honest with ourselves.\u00a0 So if you are fat, if you can reach down and grab your gut, and you have a nice little\u2014you\u2019ve got a nice handful there, that\u2019s fat. All right.\u00a0 So if we\u2019re going to deal with that, then you do not want to add too many variables right off the bat.\u00a0 Exercise is an additive habit.\u00a0 Eating meals are a default, necessary habit that you\u2019re probably doing three times a day already.\u00a0 Just replace those default meals, and this will avoid a number of complications.\u00a0 If you start exercising, many people will say, \u201cOh, my gosh.\u00a0 I\u2019ve exercised.\u00a0 I\u2019ve earned this additional food.\u201d\u00a0 What will happen?\u00a0 They will end up eating more volume than they were even before their diet.\u00a0 Then, of course, they will not lose body fat. The second is that they will become dependent on exercise, view that as the source of their fat loss\u2014which it is not.\u00a0 Diet for losing fat.\u00a0 Exercise for building muscle.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 With very rare exceptions, that\u2019s the way to think about it, at least until you\u2019re at 10 percent body fat. If you become dependent on exercise, you will get injured.\u00a0 You can get injured, and it always happens eventually.\u00a0 Then you fly off the rails.\u00a0 Yes, I agree with you 100 percent. \u00a0Focus on little or no exercise with diet exclusively.\u00a0 Nail it for four to eight weeks. For the hunger pangs, for the carb desires, and so on, the sweet tooth, you can consume a small amount of BCAAs, branched chain amino acids, to stay those off.\u00a0 The liver will convert a small amount of these branched chain amino acids.\u00a0 When I say a small amount, I mean 3 to 5 grams when you have the sugar cravings.\u00a0 The liver, through gluconeogenesis, will convert a small amount of these branched chain amino acids in the bloodstream to glucose, and to keep your brain less bitchy.\u00a0 That\u2019ll be very helpful. Another thing that can help, folks, is a few tablespoons of medium chain triglycerides.\u00a0 You could get caprylic acid.\u00a0 You could have some coconut oil in your tea, as I often do.\u00a0 You could get something from the Bulletproof folks.\u00a0 I guess it\u2019s XCT oil or something like that.\u00a0 They all work just fine, but do not guzzle this stuff.\u00a0 A few tablespoons is more than sufficient. Okay.\u00a0 Next is do you have any practical tips for dealing with people you dislike?\u00a0 Example given: coworkers, acquaintances, family members.\u00a0 Man, that sounds tough.\u00a0 That\u2019s a long list. Well, I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Number one, I read or listen to a bit of Seneca daily.\u00a0 I try to do my best.\u00a0 It\u2019s Seneca the Younger, a Stoic philosopher of 2000 years ago, the wealthiest investment banker in Rome, effectively advisor to the emperor, world-famous playwright, a real doer on the front lines who was very good at operating in high-stress environments. There are also a number of books in a series called Crucial Conversations that I think are worth checking out.\u00a0 Honest, and this is going to sound funny, but brutal honest I think goes a long way toward making these relationships either manageable or disappear.\u00a0 That\u2019s not going to happen with family, of course, but I\u2019ll give you an example. I received a phone call from a friend.\u00a0 This guy is a real friend I\u2019ve known for years about six months ago.\u00a0 He had texted me and I guess emailed me, and I get thousands of both, but I\u2019m not sure he realized this.\u00a0 He finally got me on the phone, and I was like, \u201cHey, man.\u00a0 What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s a very good dude.\u00a0 We get along great.\u00a0 He\u2019s extremely effective in the professional world. He\u2019s like, \u201cDude, what the fuck?\u00a0 You\u2019re harder to get a hold of than the fucking president.\u201d\u00a0 This is somebody who probably gets a hold of people like the president.\u00a0 He was ranting and raving and got really upset with me.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t said anything on the phone at this point.\u00a0 I said, \u201cOkay.\u00a0 Well, do you want to know the real answer?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cI have a lot of high priorities right now.\u00a0 Getting to you is probably between 15 and 20.\u201d\u00a0 That is number 15 and 20 on my priority list.\u00a0 He was like, \u201cWhat?\u00a0 Fuck you, man.\u201d\u00a0 I was like, \u201cHey, you wanted the truth.\u00a0 That\u2019s the truth.\u00a0 I love you, but that\u2019s the state of affairs.\u201d There\u2019s a great short book called Lying by Sam Harris, Ph.D., neuroscientist who has been on this podcast.\u00a0 I would encourage everyone to read that book.\u00a0 It\u2019s really enlightening, and it talks about the damage of white lies or silence in situations like that.\u00a0 It\u2019s very enabling.\u00a0 I encourage everybody to check it out. There\u2019s a quote also that I have on my refrigerator which forces me\u2014let me pick up my microphone and my recording device, which for those interested in is a Zoom H6 recording device.\u00a0 I quote like it.\u00a0 The mic is a Shure SM58 cabled with an XLR, if anybody cares.\u00a0 The quote on my refrigerator is this.\u00a0 Here we go.\u00a0 \u201cWhen jarred unavoidably by circumstances, revert it once to yourself, and don\u2019t lose the rhythm more than you can help.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.\u201d That is a quote from Marcus Aurelius.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure that is taken from Meditations, which is effectively a collection of war journal entries that he wrote to himself at the time, the emperor of Rome, the most powerful human being on the planet.\u00a0 Never intended for publication, so very cool collection of letters.\u00a0 That is a quote that also helps me to deal with people that I dislike or find difficult.\u00a0 There are a number of meditations in that book that relate to this. All right.\u00a0 Episode on Japan, very intrigued to learn more about your views, specifically on the country, culture, and travel there. All right, well a few things real quick.\u00a0 If you want to get a taste for why I love Japan so much, watch the move \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d and then go check out on YouTube a video for this heavy metal band called Babymetal.\u00a0 \u201cKarate\u201d is the song name. By the way, \u201ckarate\u201d is empty hand.\u00a0 \u201cKara\u201d is empty, and then hand is \u201cte.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s karate, just like Tegami.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a bit of trivia for those nerds out there who want some East Asian studies action.\u00a0 \u201cTegami\u201d in Japanese is hand paper, which means a letter, to write someone a nice letter. In Chinese, it\u2019s [inaudible] is hand paper, which means toilet paper, so be careful when using characters.\u00a0 The same characters, two different languages.\u00a0 Who knew? For Japan, otherwise, there\u2019s a two-part article on the blog called \u201cHacking Japan for Less Than New York City,\u201d which covers a lot of my favorite things to do, and diversions in Tokyo.\u00a0 Then there\u2019s a CNN piece called something like \u201cHow Travel Helped me Learn to Kick Ass.\u201d\u00a0 I never use that phrase, \u201ckick ass.\u201d\u00a0 Nonetheless, it covers my travel in 10th grade to Japan as an exchange student for a year, and some of the lessons I learned, which could elucidate things a bit. Biggest frustration or annoyance at the moment is golfer\u2019s elbow from gymnastics strength training, which I am addressing with every possible tool under the sun, including the Armaid device, which I quite like, voodoo flossing, the Hitachi Magic Wand, which I\u2019m not using for masturbating women.\u00a0 I\u2019m using it for my medial epicondylitis. If you guys don\u2019t know what any of that means that I just said, you could buy Hitachi Magic Wand and figure it out for yourself.\u00a0 And on, and on, and on.\u00a0 Not that I\u2019m against using it for that purpose, but not why I purchased this fine device. Which book or books have you gifted most, excluding yours?\u00a0 Definitely the letters of Seneca, the moral letters to Lucilius.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to be coming out with my own print or ebook version with original artwork just for the fuck of it.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 That\u2019s the wine bringing the F bombs.\u00a0 I was born on Long Island.\u00a0 Keep that in mind, folks\u2014rat tail and all.\u00a0 In any case, so Seneca. There\u2019s a good Penguin classics translation called Letters From a Stoic.\u00a0 The audio version that I produced is the Tao of Seneca.\u00a0 That\u2019s one.\u00a0 Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott, which is an incredible book on contending with frustration in the creative process, particularly as it relates to writing.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great book and very hilarious, and very good therapy for people who are going through tough spots when trying to do anything entrepreneurial or creative. I\u2019m going to mispronounce this again, some Irish\u2014it\u2019s not Irish.\u00a0 Celtic folks, people who know to pronounce this name properly give me a lot of shit, but Slaine: The Horned God, which is a graphic novel that I like so much that I had 2,000 copies special printed with a bunch of fun original artwork in the beginning. Artwork by Simon Bisley, incredible hand painted.\u00a0 He made the extremely well-known Lobo series, which I think was DC, if I\u2019m recalling correctly.\u00a0 Hand painted.\u00a0 Slaine: The Horned God, graphic novel.\u00a0 Then The Baron in the Trees by Italo Calvino, which is a fantastic short book about a young baron who gets in a huge tiff with his father and goes up in the trees, never to come down again, and has love affairs, battles of various types, wages, political campaigns, all from within the canopies of the trees.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great book.\u00a0 That is another I would mention. Note: You may expand your answer to include any books that you find particularly interested but haven\u2019t equally gifted, if at all.\u00a0 Given that, I would add The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, both by Nassim Taleb.\u00a0 The Black Swan in particular is the one that caught my attention. With that, folks, I am going to wrap up.\u00a0 I hope you found this entertaining, or interesting, or useful, ideally both.\u00a0 Please let me know what you thought.\u00a0 I can be reached on the Twitters @TFerriss.\u00a0 Let me know.\u00a0 Just put #QandA, and let me know what you thought of this because this is, of course, somewhat time consuming.\u00a0 So if you liked this, I\u2019ll do more of these.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to do it and drink more wine.\u00a0 If you\u2019re like, \u201cThat sucked.\u00a0 Bring back pure interviews and I only want interviews,\u201d please let me know because I want to know. For show notes, we will have links to everything that I just mentioned in this entire shindig.\u00a0 Go to www.FourHourWorkweek.com/podcast.\u00a0 Until next time and as always, thank you my little darlings for listening.\u00a0 Have a wonderful day or evening wherever you may be.\u00a0 Ta-ta. Posted on: January 1, 2018.", "speakers": ["tim ferriss"], "text_sentences": ["tim ferriss:\u00a0good golly, miss molly", "this is tim ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show", "this episode of the tim ferriss show is not a long-form interview unless you count the multiple personalities in my own head.\u00a0 we are not talking to arnold schwarzenegger, edward norton, jamie foxx, or black market biochemists, or hospice experts who have helped thousands of people die\u2014none of those things which we have done in the past.\u00a0 josh waitzkin, not going to be here", "instead, i am answering questions that you all or i should say many of you, wanted me to answer.\u00a0 there have been requests for me to do a q&a, and i went onto the facebook, www.facebook.com/timferriss, and linked to a reddit post where i had people submit and up-vote questions.\u00a0 at least 100 of you participated in this submitting questions, and many, many, many more up-voted the ones that you liked.\u00a0 i will take a stab at answering, i would say, somewhere between 10 and 20 questions in this short in-between-isode, shorter than my two- to three-hour interviews.\u00a0 i will infuse that with wine and water with some lemon in it", "i\u2019ll give you another gear visual.\u00a0 i have my water in a hydro flask, which is 40 ounces.\u00a0 that\u2019s 1.18 liters.\u00a0 why this particular size?\u00a0 well, i realized when traveling in columbia doing an acroyoga immersive course\u2014and you can look up acroyoga, and i suggest searching the name jason neemer at the same time\u2014this particular size of insulated water bottle also can be used for not foam rolling, because it\u2019s hard, but rolling out the hip flexors, quads, et cetera.\u00a0 it serves that dual purpose, so i have that in front of me", "we are going to cover quite a few things, note-taking.\u00a0 we are going to cover how i view and develop particular skills, and things i\u2019m excited about in the next three to five years.\u00a0 many of these answers are informed by the world-class experts who have been on the podcast before and things i\u2019ve learned from them, just in case you think this might be too self-indulgent", "i hope you find some value in it.\u00a0 let\u2019s just jump into the questions", "the first\u2014i\u2019m going to pause for dramatic drink of wine from my beaker.\u00a0 it\u2019s a beaker of sorts.\u00a0 it\u2019s 250 ml kimax kimble beaker.\u00a0 i first saw these types of glasses at flower and water, a restaurant here in san francisco that\u2019s outstanding.\u00a0 i\u2019m actually involved with a sister restaurant called central kitchen.\u00a0 why would i find this interesting?\u00a0 number one, i like giving people beakers in my house to drink wine from because they all put on funny faces expecting that i\u2019ve stored blood, urine, or something else in it.\u00a0 two-hundred-fifty milliliters, also, i enjoy measuring things.\u00a0 that is exactly one-third of a standard bottle of wine, 750 ml.\u00a0 pause for a sip, and i hope you\u2019re all having a lovely day wherever you are, or evening.\u00a0 hold on", "oh, so delicious.\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 here we go.\u00a0 first question and i\u2019m not going to read off the names of the people who submitted these just in case i criticize the questions.\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 the first question is if you were to do a zero to hero transformation of someone, what would be the path you would take?\u00a0 i\u2019m speaking about business as well as health", "now let me begin my answer with a story.\u00a0 then i\u2019ll take a stab at answering this.\u00a0 i recall after graduating from college\u2014this was 2000 or so\u2014i moved to silicon valley and ended up getting a very low-paying job in technical sales for a mass data storage company, storage area networking company.\u00a0 there was a mentor to the ceo of this company.\u00a0 it was a very young ceo, very capable, about 23 or 25 years old", "this mentor was one of the highest-ranking executives at a company called brocade.\u00a0 he was looked at and viewed with reverence and awe by many people in the company.\u00a0 i remember at one point getting into the elevator going down at the same time as he was ending a meeting with the ceo, so we ended up in the elevator together, and we struck up a conversation and ended up having an email exchange about philosophies of life, basically.\u00a0 i tried to keep it very succinct.\u00a0 i knew that if i abused the opportunity to communicate with him, i would lose that immediately.\u00a0 at the same time, i was eager to learn as much as possible from him", "now flash forward a month or two.\u00a0 i shot him an email that ended the communication.\u00a0 that email asked two questions, in effect.\u00a0 what should i do to become successful, and something along the lines of, \u201chere i am.\u00a0 i\u2019m doing this, this, and this.\u00a0 what should i do with my life?\u201d here\u2019s the problem with those two questions, and in a way, the question that was asked.\u00a0 you have to fit the question to the format, particularly when dealing with someone who has a lot going on.\u00a0 he responded prettily angrily, at least from the way i read the tone with, \u201cwhat do you expect me to do with these questions?\u00a0 these are not good questions.\u00a0 i can\u2019t answer them,\u201d because it would take him hours and hours just to clarify exactly what we mean by, for instance in this one, zero to hero.\u00a0 hero for what?\u00a0 how do we objectively or subjectively define success", "all right.\u00a0 but let me take a stab at this, just underscoring the importance of asking questions that fit the format and fit the person\u2019s bandwidth.\u00a0 you see this a lot in q&as where questions are posed which are not necessarily bad questions, but they\u2019re somewhat imprecise and cannot be answered in the time allocated", "here we go.\u00a0 here\u2019s what i would do.\u00a0 i hate to presuppose people have read my books who are listening to the podcast, but the fact of the matter is that i\u2019ve answered a lot of this before, so i would assign reading.\u00a0 in this particular order, this is what came to mind as i was having dinner earlier", "i would have them read the magic of thinking big by david j schwartz.\u00a0 this is a book that\u2019s actually on my bookshelf facing out, so i\u2019m reminded of it constantly.\u00a0 next, i would have them read the four-hour workweek written by yours truly", "next i would have them read the effective executive by peter drucker, probably the best book or almost certainly the best book i\u2019ve ever read on productivity, really with a focus by necessity on being effective, doing the right things, and not efficiency, doing things well because you can do a lot of unimportant or meaningless things extremely quickly and well.\u00a0 that does not make them important, and it will never make them important", "okay, the effective executive.\u00a0 next how to stop worrying and start living by mr.\u00a0 carnegie.\u00a0 i believe that that covers the major bases.\u00a0 in terms of getting someone on the path from zero to here on business.\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 there you have it", "the next is health for our body, i think the book that was written to answer that question.\u00a0 the short synopsis would be number-one, create accountability through some type of betting circle.\u00a0 i think money is an easy tool to use in this case, so get together with four or five friends.\u00a0 put in $100 each, for instance.\u00a0 whoever loses the most body fat in the next x number of months\u2014make a specific date\u2014gets the entire pool and bragging rights, and shit-talking rights, of course", "this accomplishes some very interesting things.\u00a0 i won\u2019t delve into the behavioral psychology aspects of this, but this is an incentive.\u00a0 ultimately, you\u2019re only as loyal as your incentives.\u00a0 i hate to say that, but it\u2019s true.\u00a0 self-control is overrated.\u00a0 you need a stick or a carrot, and this provides both.\u00a0 the fear and consequences of losing money, which is actually a greater motivator than that of gaining money, and then social accountability.\u00a0 create a betting circle or something like that.\u00a0 you can use tools like www.coach.me, which is a site, www.stickk.com, and others, www.dietbet.com, for instance.\u00a0 but create a betting circle, number one", "number-two is focus on diet.\u00a0 ninety-nine percent of fat loss is diet mediating.\u00a0 you cannot out-exercise your mouth.\u00a0 for those people who have a lot of weight to lose, or just want to lose weight effectively, i say do not add any new exercise.\u00a0 focus on diet for at least the first four to eight weeks.\u00a0 that would be the slow-carb diet with one cheat day as prescribed in the four-hour body", "you can just search \u201cslow carb diet\u201d and find all the basics, or \u201chow to lose 100 pounds on the slow carb diet\u201d with a bunch of case studies, which is on the blog", "next, if you\u2019re going to add exercise, i would suggest two-handed kettlebell swings in one set of 50 to 75 reps if possible.\u00a0 you can break that up into multiple sets if you cannot hit the target of 75 reps.\u00a0 you do that once or twice per week.\u00a0 search for a blog post called, i think it is, \u201ccreating the perfect posterior,\u201d which has demo videos and explains exactly how to do this", "you can build a kettlebell very cheaply with basic supplies from a plumbing store.\u00a0 it\u2019s called the t-bar handle or the t-bar kettlebell swings.\u00a0 you can search for that as well", "on off days, walk for at least one hour.\u00a0 that would be my recommendation", "last but not least, meditate.\u00a0 you can take a transcendental meditation course as i did, or you can practice vipassana, mindfulness insight mediation, et cetera, or just use, as i would recommend to most people, an app like headspace, and practice for 10 minutes in the morning for 10 days straight.\u00a0 that is my attempt at answering that very broad question", "next and this is ancillary, if you were tasked with building a person from a blank slate, a la frankenstein\u2019s creature or an android, what skills, qualities, would you give him first?\u00a0 i will tell you", "number-one, i\u2019m just thinking of building a terminator here.\u00a0 number-one would be the ability to build\u2014assuming they have biological requirements.\u00a0 they\u2019re not just made of metal and computational components, so they actually need food, et cetera, and are susceptible to cold and whatnot.\u00a0 i would teach them how to build or find shelter because the rule of threes would dictate\u2014and this is in the four-hour chef for people who want to really go off the rails with survivalist stuff", "you can survive.\u00a0 the guideline is in harsh conditions or changing conditions, you can survive without shelter for three hours.\u00a0 you can survive without water for three days.\u00a0 you can survive without food for three weeks.\u00a0 food is not the highest priority despite all the sensationalist bullshit television shows you might watch.\u00a0 you just don\u2019t need food, really, for a very long time.\u00a0 so shelter, number one.\u00a0 the next would be the ability to ask good questions.\u00a0 that would be along the lines of cal fussman who was interviewed on this podcast, the best interviewer i have ever met in my life who has interviewed every celebrity imaginable for esquire magazine for the \u201cwhat i\u2019ve learned\u201d column.\u00a0 this ranges from mohammad ali to gorbachev to presidents.\u00a0 it just goes down the list\u2014johnny depp\u2014everybody you can possibly imagine", "way back in the day when he was paying his\u2014well, not really paying his way.\u00a0 i should say befriending his way across europe and around the world, he didn\u2019t have a lot of budget, and he would find free places to stay by, say, walking down a train, sitting next to a grandmother, and ultimately asking her how to make, say, the best borscht, depending on the location.\u00a0 pick your regional soup.\u00a0 \u201chow do you make a really good borscht?\u201d\u00a0 it would end two hours later with, \u201cyou need to come.\u00a0 you stay with my family.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to make you borscht.\u201d\u00a0 so the ability to ask good questions is really the ability to think clearly.\u00a0 if you think about the underlying process of conscious thought, it is really one of asking and answering questions, so the ability to ask good questions.\u00a0 maybe last, i would say the ability to identify or find people, powerful people, in times of crisis.\u00a0 this is a weird one, but it came to mind earlier", "that is a window of opportunity to crack through the noise as a signal if you have something to offer, and develop relationships that would otherwise be above your paygrade or social stature", "next, how do you build rapport with your podcast guests?\u00a0 for the most part, the conversations flow well, and your guests are very open with you.\u00a0 i would love some tips i can implement to build that type of rapport with people", "all right, there are a few things.\u00a0 number one, making someone comfortable with a conversation or, in this case, an interview, starts before the interview.\u00a0 a big part of that is making it clear to them this is not a \u201cgotcha\u201d interview, and you have final cut", "this is what they do with \u201cinside the actors studio,\u201d which i learned by hiring a researcher who had worked with the team and lipton at \u201cinside the actors studio.\u201d\u00a0 they say you have final cut.\u00a0 what does that mean?\u00a0 that means if you say anything embarrassing or you say anything you regret, we can cut it out before it goes live, and you have the ability to make those cuts", "i always encourage people to be as raw and detailed as possible.\u00a0 we can always cut it out afterwards.\u00a0 we can\u2019t add it in afterwards", "then you have social proof at one point where i say, \u201cyour friends a, b, c, d, and e have been on the podcast,\u201d or \u201ca and b,\u201d or just a.\u00a0 \u201cfeel free to chat with them.\u00a0 this is a friendly podcast with an incredibly huge impact with the demographic that i can describe,\u201d and then go on.\u00a0 you have to sell the show and the importance of being candid and raw", "then i will do a few things to make them comfortable.\u00a0 number one is i will oftentimes\u2014not always\u2014send them the rapid-fire questions that i ask at the end of the podcast in advance because i want them to have good answers.\u00a0 you, the audience, want them to have good answers, and it still keeps it fresh for me, but it gives them a layer of comfort.\u00a0 even if two-thirds of the interview is spontaneous, they have something they know they can knock out of the park if they take 10 minutes to think about it beforehand", "then there are probably 20 more things, but i\u2019ll just give you two more.\u00a0 at least 10 minutes of pre-interview talk, so call and actually talk to them for a period of time before you start the interview.\u00a0 you don\u2019t want to jump immediately into it if you can avoid that.\u00a0 the way you elicit vulnerability is by being vulnerable yourself", "i hope it does not seem like i\u2019m trying to monopolize conversations when i interview people for the podcast, but a very important component of making them feel comfortable enough to provide stories, tactics, et cetera that people have never heard before is being forthcoming with my own stories of vulnerability or things that they wouldn\u2019t expect me to share in an interview, and they reciprocate in kind", "those are a few things, and that\u2014by the way\u2014a number of those, i picked up from neil strauss, a seven- or eight-time the new york times bestselling author but also an incredible interviewer who has written a lot for the new york times and rolling stone", "next, this is a multi-parter.\u00a0 you crafty little devils and your multi-bulleted questions.\u00a0 here we go.\u00a0 expand more on your teens and 20s.\u00a0 what were you doing?\u00a0 what type of person were you?\u00a0 what were your influences?\u00a0 i\u2019m just going to cut it short and say i was a wrestler.\u00a0 i think that sports should be mandatory in elementary school and high school, as they were at the second high school i went to, which was a spectacular school called saint paul\u2019s in new hampshire.\u00a0 i went from a bad public high school in long island to a very, very tough boarding school in new hampshire, school six days a week, mandatory sports, chapel almost every morning, seated meal with coat and tie, like dead poets society style, and on and on", "it really kicked my ass, which was great.\u00a0 but i wanted to say that sports, i think, enabled you to inoculate yourself against fear and failure because you are constantly delivered small doses of both, and you have to contend with them in a sports arena where success is objectively determined.\u00a0 i think this is a real godsend and gift.\u00a0 it is a form in which you can practice and condition yourself to be more effective in every area of life", "two large influences, one in person, john buxton who is my wrestling coach and coached some incredible people that went on to do amazing things, like charles best who is founder of www.donorschoose.org, which you guys should all check out", "the other mentor who i\u2019ve actually come to know a bit now in person\u2014which is amazing.\u00a0 i actually watched the olympic trials in iowa with him a few weeks ago\u2014dan gable.\u00a0 there was a video called \u201ccompetitor supreme\u201d about dan gable that i must have watched 100 times", "i will leave it at that, but everyone should watch it.\u00a0 it might be a dude thing.\u00a0 i don\u2019t know, but high emphasis on aggression, determination, grit, et cetera.\u00a0 certainly there is no gender-specific requirement for grit and resilience.\u00a0 that goes across the board, and i hope to explore that actually in the new future with a female author and scientist who has written a book titled grit, but we\u2019ll come back to that", "all right.\u00a0 do you believe that you or people in general have personal callings?\u00a0 do you believe that circumstances are designed so that we have an approximate or ideal life path", "well, i have a few, perhaps, contradictory answers to this.\u00a0 the first answer is no.\u00a0 well, no-asterisk.\u00a0 that means that most people will not immediately know what their calling is.\u00a0 now if you\u2019re tiger woods, and you\u2019re drawing trajectories of different irons when you\u2019re 6 or 7 years old, okay.\u00a0 you have been selected by the universe to specialize.\u00a0 i think that can be a gift", "it can be a curse, of course, as all these things are.\u00a0 for most folks, you can have many different vocations, callings, or purposes throughout your life.\u00a0 certainly that is how i feel personally.\u00a0 at one point, i read\u2014i think this was actually a [inaudible] of some type\u2014and i\u2019m paraphrasing this.\u00a0 it stated roughly that your calling is looking for you", "this has been a very big shift for me in the last two or three years that has taken the pressure off but actually allowed me to get a lot more done simultaneously.\u00a0 that is throwing the entire paradigm of you need to find your calling, you need to find your passion, on its head.\u00a0 look at it through the

that\u2019s actually the right metaphor, but\u2014you will encounter this.\u00a0 you have to have the presence of mind to recognize it when it appears or presents itself.\u00a0 i do believe that developing practices of mindfulness, like using, for instance, an app in the morning to meditate for 10 to 20 minutes for seven to 10 days straight to develop that habit", "other related tools,

relationships you can observe in massive data sets or in scientific studies, and people convince themselves of causality, i.e.\u00a0 a causes b when it is just chance.\u00a0 you have to understand a little bit of statistics to really crunch that properly, but in reviewing data, yes.\u00a0 i believe in coincidences.\u00a0 there are a lot of folks who will torture the data to get all sorts of conclusions out of the data, which may be popular, i.e.\u00a0 the china study, but not in any respect defensible or accurate", "you can go back to the original monograph for that or look at the long-term implications of cancer from, for instance, purely plant-based diets and so on that have come up recently.\u00a0 this is to say also, guys, don\u2019t assume an agenda.\u00a0 i\u2019m not part of the pro-meat lobby.\u00a0 i\u2019m reviewing the data.\u00a0 on either side or any side, do i believe in coincidences?\u00a0 yes.\u00a0 absolutely when reviewing data.\u00a0 in life generally, if we\u2019re talking about at the 30,000-foot level, i find it enabling, and there are people who take issue with this.\u00a0 i think i sometimes take issue with this", "i find it helpful\u2014and

train myself, or i view it as what is needed to happen for me to learn a particular lesson.\u00a0 i suppose that would mean that i am ruling out coincidence.\u00a0 i am looking for purpose or reason

illustrate it with a story.\u00a0 i was having a conversation with a very close friend of mine, who has a successful business with millions of dollars, and he always had ruled out decisions that would limit his travel, limit his options, and he viewed himself as the guy who was independent.\u00a0 he worked for his freedom to be an entrepreneur until he realized he had a high degree of stress from infinite options", "he needed positive constraints, as i do.\u00a0 infinite options equals ultimate prison in many circumstances.\u00a0 you end up with this paradox of choices.\u00a0 it\u2019s like standing in front of shelving at a safeway with 300 brands of toothpaste and just wasting 15 minutes of your life just trying to pick a fucking toothpaste.\u00a0 you don\u2019t need that type of cognitive burden and decision fatigue", "why did i get one?\u00a0 because i always felt incomplete without a dog.\u00a0 that might sound pitiful.\u00a0 i think it\u2019s just being honest.\u00a0 i grew up with two rescues, and there is something in my dna that just matches with canines, number-one.\u00a0 i wanted to care for something outside myself", "now you would say that infringes on my freedom.\u00a0 on the other hand, you could argue that when i am miserable, i am miserable because of a me focus, and the remedy to that is precisely doing something which is infringing on my freedom, my options, but is a positive constraint that improves my wellbeing and contentedness, which is having something like a dog that i need to keep alive.\u00a0 that is another piece of it", "next question: training tips.\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 i will probably write something more elaborate on this in the future.\u00a0 number-one, look into crate training.\u00a0 i think ian dunbar has quite a bit that is good on this.\u00a0 clicker training, use a clicker.\u00a0 this is basically a positive reinforcement tool that has been refined with a whistle or a clicker in marine training with dolphins and so on.\u00a0 you can use it for dogs.\u00a0 it speeds everything up dramatically", "the best book that touches on this and many other principles\u2014and there\u2019s a lot of bullshit in the dog training world\u2014is [don\u2019t]\u00a0shoot the dog by karen pryor.\u00a0 she is very legit.\u00a0 terrible title.\u00a0 fantastic book.\u00a0 even if you care not one iota about dog training, for human training, if you want to get your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, if you want to get the cat off the table, if you want to negotiate with your kid to get them to do something, this is a great book, so check out [don\u2019t]\u00a0shoot the dog", "next tip for training is train for attention.\u00a0 this means training your dog to at least engage in eye contact and check in with you regularly when you give specific cues.\u00a0 if you search for \u201cthe most important skill to teach your dog ferriss,\u201d i put up a short video demonstrating how i do this with my dog using a clicker.\u00a0 it\u2019s very easy to do and pays incredible dividends", "that alone allows me to go to most dog parks and have people comment on how my dog is the best-behaved or trained there.\u00a0 it is a cheat, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is of any less value.\u00a0 it\u2019s a prerequisite for all the other types of skills you\u2019d want to layer on top of that, so train for attention.\u00a0 check out that video, the most important skill to teach your dog, and then my last name", "a few other things, depending on how old or young the dog is.\u00a0 expose them to many different surfaces and many different people, ages, gender, race, et cetera.\u00a0 surface is very important if you\u2019re going to travel with your dog a lot, which i do.\u00a0 grates, sand, grass, astroturf, carpet, et cetera.\u00a0 you want to expose them to as much as possible.\u00a0 if your dog freaks out about something, which mine did for a long time with certain types of sliding doors and entryways", "take a temple grandin approach.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have time to get into who that is, but crouch down to the eye level of your dog, and check things out.\u00a0 don\u2019t assume they see the exact same thing, but it will give you some improved perspective", "let\u2019s see.\u00a0 what breed is molly?\u00a0 why\u2019d you pick that?\u00a0 she is a rescue mutt", "\u00a0i have no idea.\u00a0 i did a genetic test with a company that i am convinced is a complete scam.\u00a0 they basically sent me a cover sheet that said, \u201ccongratulations", "you have a dog.\u00a0 it might be one of these 20 breeds, and here are 30 pages stolen from wikipedia on genetics", "congratulations.\u201d but she looks a lot like an [inaudible], which is a short-haired herding dog that looks like a bernese mountain dog, closely related.\u00a0 that is that.\u00a0 i believe in supporting no-kill dog shelters whenever possible, so i adopted her", "what have you learned about human behavior from molly?\u00a0 i have learned the drive to be right or righteous is often counterproductive.\u00a0 what i mean by that is you should focus on positive reinforcement whenever possible.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have time to get into why that\u2019s the case, although there is a book.\u00a0 it\u2019s very hard to find", "i\u2019m fantasizing about buying the rights and giving it away for free as a pdf to the world.\u00a0 it\u2019s called command performance, which is a compilation of training tips from whole dog journal.\u00a0 i\u2019m not making this up.\u00a0 it\u2019s great.\u00a0 it\u2019s very short.\u00a0 most dog training books are 99 percent bullshit subjective made-up nonsense and then a handful of tactical things.\u00a0 this is all tactical.\u00a0 maybe one behavior every three pages for 100 pages.\u00a0 it\u2019s great", "but looking at the flipside of that, negative reinforcement or punishment, so let\u2019s just say you come home and your dog shit on the floor.\u00a0 guess what.\u00a0 this is going to happen, if you get a puppy especially, or whatever it might be", "at some point, your dog\u2019s going to make a mistake.\u00a0 if you, let\u2019s say, come across it, and you don\u2019t know when it happened, but you\u2019re pissed, and you want to make a point of teaching your dog that this is the wrong thing to do, in your mind.\u00a0 this is how you\u2019re going about rationalizing what you do next, which is, let\u2019s say, grabbing the dog by the collar, and putting their head right next to it, and saying, \u201cno.\u00a0 bad dog.\u00a0 bad dog.\u201d\u00a0 well, guess what.\u00a0 if this dog didn\u2019t take the shit right in front of you, they\u2019re not going to connect not crapping in the house.\u00a0 they will perhaps conclude that they shouldn\u2019t go to the bathroom where you can find it, so they\u2019ll just go in the closet and take a dump on your shoes instead", "the point being it pays to study behavioral conditioning, operant in classical conditioning, and you\u2019ll realize that very often, being right or righteous and disciplining your dog is not effective.\u00a0 it just is not effective, and this translates to interacting with other humans, of course, because we are mammals.\u00a0 whether you\u2019re prodding a slug with a little electrode and looking at operate conditioning and ebbinghaus forgetting curves and so on, it\u2019s the same shit.\u00a0 we like to think of ourselves as very fancy creatures, but the fact of the matter is you can condition human begins to do fantastic things or atrocious things very easily by understanding operant and classical conditionings.\u00a0 conditioning is no different, which is why [don\u2019t] shoot the dog is such a great book for understanding how to modify behavior, your own and other people or species.\u00a0 there you have it", "all right.\u00a0 explain why you avoid feeding fowl to your dog.\u00a0 i\u2019ve looked but can\u2019t find the reason.\u00a0 this is a simple reason.\u00a0 it might not be a good one.\u00a0 i had a very good chef and food scientist tell me to avoid fowl.\u00a0 i asked him why, and he said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re fucking disgusting.\u201d two weeks later, there was a recall on the same brand of food that i bought my dog, but there was a recall on the duck and chicken, on the fowl.\u00a0 it just seems like there are higher incidences of food contamination, but i could be investing that", "all right.\u00a0 next question.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to go for another 10 or 15 minutes.\u00a0 \u201chey, tim.\u00a0 you might have covered this previously, but i\u2019m really interested to hear how you met and became friends with kevin rose.\u00a0 kevin rose i met through aubrey sabala, aubs.\u00a0 how you doing?\u00a0

would you choose to major in and why?\u00a0 it can be for personal reasons or fiscal reasons.\u00a0 i assume you would choose not to go at all, but let\u2019s say you had to.\u00a0 that deserves another sip of wine.\u00a0 bear with me, folks.\u00a0 oh, so delicious", "well, you assumed incorrectly.\u00a0 i would go to college.\u00a0 i think that despite the dropout fetishizing we have in the u.s., there is still a fantastic place for college, and that is for two reasons.\u00a0 number one, i view the objective of a liberal arts education, if that is what we\u2019re talking about, as creating a well-rounded human being\u2014well-rounded and open-minded human being, not preparing someone, as would be the case in a specialty professional school, for one industry or profession", "that being the case, i will say this and bite my tongue at the same time.\u00a0 number one, many of the people i know who have done very well financially but have not gone to college carry with them an insecurity about that for the rest of their life, for their entire lives.\u00a0 they will open up about this with close friends after a few glasses of wine", "the second and more important piece is that i\u2019ve met many people who talk a lot of trash about going to college.\u00a0 they did not go themselves, and they are very successful financially, and extremely one-dimensional.\u00a0 they are great at crafting deals, negotiating, and they know absolutely fuck-all about anything outside of that realm.\u00a0 this is not universal.\u00a0 there are some incredible exceptions, but this is very common", "i would absolutely still go to college, but i would say the value of that from a professional or career standpoint is\u2014well, there are two different strata we can talk about.\u00a0 i think that if you\u2019re not a zuckerberg\u2014and lets\u2019 face it.\u00a0 most of us are not\u2014then having college graduate on your resume will help you to achieve a guaranteed level of income above the norm that will be very hard to come by if you are not an entrepreneur who is a zuckerberg", "the second is much like mba programs, people ask me, \u201cis it worth it going to an mba program?\u201d\u00a0 i say, \u201cwell, it depends on your goals and it depends on the school.\u00a0 if you go to, say, a top 10 school or a top 50 school, undergraduate, it can certainly be worth it.\u201d\u00a0 if you go to a harvard, or princeton, or stanford, that is a golden ticket in many different worlds, so it is worth it", "so now i\u2019m going to get off my soap box about college.\u00a0 can you educate yourself well without it?\u00a0 yes, but it takes someone who is self-directed or disciplined enough to do that through cultivation by parents or through conditioning and self-development", "next, what would i major in?\u00a0 i would major in what i majored in when i went to school, which was east asian studies.\u00a0 i think you should focus on obsessions and communication.\u00a0 that has served me very well in life, so i\u2019m perhaps speaking from a limited personal experience, but i was never encouraged to take a technical path", "it might have been terrible even if i had been encouraged, so i\u2019m not going to say computer science because that is the way of the future, and if you don\u2019t code, you\u2019re not going to be literate, and you\u2019re fucked.\u00a0 i\u2019m not going to say that.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to say you should focus on your obsessions because if you\u2019re not obsessed, if you don\u2019t have that excitement, you\u2019re not going to be any better than mediocre in any field, in my opinion", "and communication because you\u2019re going to require that no matter what.\u00a0 you are going to have to have a clear ability to communicate verbally and in the written word.\u00a0 that could mean english.\u00a0 it could mean any number of things.\u00a0 writing courses with extremely merciless teachers are also very helpful.\u00a0 there you have it", "what do i think about going to school aboard?\u00a0 i know tim lived in germany.\u00a0 yeah, i think it should be mandatory for one year, ideally in 10th

some cases, i\u2019ll just put \u201cph,\u201d remember those phrases, and then i\u2019ll write down all of the page numbers for the phrase, the turns of phrase that i like", "now, this is the critical piece.\u00a0 when i go through a second time\u2014because some folks have said highlighting in my own notes always seems random.\u00a0 i hope this was important until my highlighting

three times.\u00a0 otherwise, it\u2019s not worth reading once", "i will go through multiple passes looking at my highlights, and i will put t1, t2, t3, t4 on each of these passes.\u00a0 what does this mean?\u00a0 i\u2019ll underline highlighted stuff.\u00a0 then i will go back and review those highlights.\u00a0 if i still think it\u2019s worth highlighting, i\u2019ll put t2", "i will often

to one wake cycle whenever possible.\u00a0 that means don\u2019t stay up on a friday if your cheat day is saturday, as it is for me and many people, hence the nickname fatter-day.\u00a0 do not stay up until midnight, cheat for four hours, then go to bed at 4:00 a.m., wake up in the middle of the day, and then cheat for another 24 hours.\u00a0 that will fuck you up.\u00a0 one wake cycle.\u00a0 that

no cheat day, and what are the pros and cons?\u00a0 yes, you can do that.\u00a0 some people have benefited from that.\u00a0 most people, 90 percent, will benefit from the psychological release valve

complicit in killing them.\u00a0 fat-shaming, go fuck yourself.\u00a0 i want to help people first and foremost, and what that means is we have to be honest with ourselves.\u00a0 so if you are fat, if you can reach down and grab your gut, and you have a nice little\u2014you\u2019ve got a nice handful there, that\u2019s fat", "all right.\u00a0 so if we\u2019re going to deal with that, then you do not want to add too many variables right off the bat.\u00a0 exercise is an additive habit.\u00a0 eating meals are a default, necessary habit that you\u2019re probably doing three times a day already.\u00a0 just replace those default meals, and this will avoid a number of complications.\u00a0 if you start exercising, many people will say, \u201coh, my gosh.\u00a0 i\u2019ve exercised.\u00a0 i\u2019ve earned this additional food.\u201d\u00a0 what will happen?\u00a0 they will end up eating more volume than they were even before their diet.\u00a0 then, of course, they will not lose body fat", "the second is that they will become dependent on exercise, view that as the source of their fat loss\u2014which it is not.\u00a0 diet for losing fat.\u00a0 exercise for building muscle.\u00a0 period.\u00a0 with very rare exceptions, that\u2019s the way to think about it, at least until you\u2019re at 10 percent body fat", "if you become dependent on exercise, you will get injured.\u00a0 you can get injured, and it always happens eventually.\u00a0 then you fly off the rails.\u00a0 yes, i agree with you 100 percent", "\u00a0focus on little or no exercise with diet exclusively.\u00a0 nail it for four to eight weeks", "for the hunger pangs, for the carb desires, and so on, the sweet tooth, you can consume a small amount of bcaas, branched chain amino acids, to stay those off.\u00a0 the liver will convert a small amount of these branched chain amino acids.\u00a0 when i say a small amount, i mean 3 to 5 grams when you have the sugar cravings.\u00a0 the liver, through gluconeogenesis, will convert a small amount of these branched chain amino acids in the bloodstream to glucose, and to keep your brain less bitchy.\u00a0 that\u2019ll be very helpful", "another thing that can help, folks, is a few tablespoons of medium chain triglycerides.\u00a0 you could get caprylic acid.\u00a0 you could have some coconut oil in your tea, as i often do.\u00a0 you could get something from the bulletproof folks.\u00a0 i guess it\u2019s xct oil or something like that.\u00a0 they all work just fine, but do not guzzle this stuff.\u00a0 a few tablespoons is more than sufficient", "okay.\u00a0 next is do you have any practical tips for dealing with people you dislike?\u00a0 example given: coworkers, acquaintances, family members.\u00a0 man, that sounds tough.\u00a0 that\u2019s a long list", "well, i\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 yes.\u00a0 number one, i read or listen to a bit of seneca daily.\u00a0 i try to do my best.\u00a0 it\u2019s seneca the younger, a stoic philosopher of 2000 years ago, the wealthiest investment banker in rome, effectively advisor to the emperor, world-famous playwright, a real doer on the front lines who was very good at operating in high-stress environments", "there are also a number of books in a series called crucial conversations that i think are worth checking out.\u00a0 honest, and this is going to sound funny, but brutal honest i think goes a long way toward making these relationships either manageable or disappear.\u00a0 that\u2019s not going to happen with family, of course, but i\u2019ll give you an example", "i received a phone call from a friend.\u00a0 this guy is a real friend i\u2019ve known for years about six months ago.\u00a0 he had texted me and i guess emailed me, and i get thousands of both, but i\u2019m not sure he realized this.\u00a0 he finally got me on the phone, and i was like, \u201chey, man.\u00a0 what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0 he\u2019s a very good dude.\u00a0 we get along great.\u00a0 he\u2019s extremely effective in the professional world", "he\u2019s like, \u201cdude, what the fuck?\u00a0 you\u2019re harder to get a hold of than the fucking president.\u201d\u00a0 this is somebody who probably gets a hold of people like the president.\u00a0 he was ranting and raving and got really upset with me.\u00a0 i hadn\u2019t said anything on the phone at this point.\u00a0 i said, \u201cokay.\u00a0 well, do you want to know the real answer?\u201d\u00a0 he said, \u201csure.\u201d\u00a0 i said, \u201ci have a lot of high priorities right now.\u00a0 getting to you is probably between 15 and 20.\u201d\u00a0 that is number 15 and 20 on my priority list.\u00a0 he was like, \u201cwhat?\u00a0 fuck you, man.\u201d\u00a0 i was like, \u201chey, you wanted the truth.\u00a0 that\u2019s the truth.\u00a0 i love you, but that\u2019s the state of affairs.\u201d there\u2019s a great short book called lying by sam harris, ph.d., neuroscientist who has been on this podcast.\u00a0 i would encourage everyone to read that book.\u00a0 it\u2019s really enlightening, and it talks about the damage of white lies or silence in situations like that.\u00a0 it\u2019s very enabling.\u00a0 i encourage everybody to check it out", "there\u2019s a quote also that i have on my refrigerator which forces me\u2014let me pick up my microphone and my recording device, which for those interested in is a zoom h6 recording device.\u00a0 i quote like it.\u00a0 the mic is a shure sm58 cabled with an xlr, if anybody cares.\u00a0 the quote on my refrigerator is this.\u00a0 here we go.\u00a0 \u201cwhen jarred unavoidably by circumstances, revert it once to yourself, and don\u2019t lose the rhythm more than you can help.\u00a0 you\u2019ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.\u201d that is a quote from marcus aurelius.\u00a0 i\u2019m sure that is taken from meditations, which is effectively a collection of war journal entries that he wrote to himself at the time, the emperor of rome, the most powerful human being on the planet.\u00a0 never intended for publication, so very cool collection of letters.\u00a0 that is a quote that also helps me to deal with people that i dislike or find difficult.\u00a0 there are a number of meditations in that book that relate to this", "all right.\u00a0 episode on japan, very intrigued to learn more about your views, specifically on the country, culture, and travel there", "all right, well a few things real quick.\u00a0 if you want to get a taste for why i love japan so much, watch the move \u201cspirited away,\u201d and then go check out on youtube a video for this heavy metal band called babymetal.\u00a0 \u201ckarate\u201d is the song name", "by the way, \u201ckarate\u201d is empty hand.\u00a0 \u201ckara\u201d is empty, and then hand is \u201cte.\u201d\u00a0 that\u2019s karate, just like tegami.\u00a0 here\u2019s a bit of trivia for those nerds out there who want some east asian studies action.\u00a0 \u201ctegami\u201d in japanese is hand paper, which means a letter, to write someone a nice letter", "in chinese, it\u2019s [inaudible] is hand paper, which means toilet paper, so be careful when using characters.\u00a0 the same characters, two different languages.\u00a0 who knew", "for japan, otherwise, there\u2019s a two-part article on the blog called \u201chacking japan for less than new york city,\u201d which covers a lot of my favorite things to do, and diversions in tokyo.\u00a0 then there\u2019s a cnn piece called something like \u201chow travel helped me learn to kick ass.\u201d\u00a0 i never use that phrase, \u201ckick ass.\u201d\u00a0 nonetheless, it covers my travel in 10th grade to japan as an exchange student for a year, and some of the lessons i learned, which could elucidate things a bit", "biggest frustration or annoyance at the moment is golfer\u2019s elbow from gymnastics strength training, which i am addressing with every possible tool under the sun, including the armaid device, which i quite like, voodoo flossing, the hitachi magic wand, which i\u2019m not using for masturbating women.\u00a0 i\u2019m using it for my medial epicondylitis", "if you guys don\u2019t know what any of that means that i just said, you could buy hitachi magic wand and figure it out for yourself.\u00a0 and on, and on, and on.\u00a0 not that i\u2019m against using it for that purpose, but not why i purchased this fine device", "which book or books have you gifted most, excluding yours?\u00a0 definitely the letters of seneca, the moral letters to lucilius.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to be coming out with my own print or ebook version with original artwork just for the fuck of it.\u00a0 wow.\u00a0 that\u2019s the wine bringing the f bombs.\u00a0 i was born on long island.\u00a0 keep that in mind, folks\u2014rat tail and all.\u00a0 in any case, so seneca", "there\u2019s a good penguin classics translation called letters from a stoic.\u00a0 the audio version that i produced is the tao of seneca.\u00a0 that\u2019s one.\u00a0 bird by bird by anne lamott, which is an incredible book on contending with frustration in the creative process, particularly as it relates to writing.\u00a0 it\u2019s a great book and very hilarious, and very good therapy for people who are going through tough spots when trying to do anything entrepreneurial or creative", "i\u2019m going to mispronounce this again, some irish\u2014it\u2019s not irish.\u00a0 celtic folks, people who know to pronounce this name properly give me a lot of shit, but slaine: the horned god, which is a graphic novel that i like so much that i had 2,000 copies special printed with a bunch of fun original artwork in the beginning", "artwork by simon bisley, incredible hand painted.\u00a0 he made the extremely well-known lobo series, which i think was dc, if i\u2019m recalling correctly.\u00a0 hand painted.\u00a0 slaine: the horned god, graphic novel.\u00a0 then the baron in the trees by italo calvino, which is a fantastic short book about a young baron who gets in a huge tiff with his father and goes up in the trees, never to come down again, and has love affairs, battles of various types, wages, political campaigns, all from within the canopies of the trees.\u00a0 it\u2019s a great book.\u00a0 that is another i would mention", "note: you may expand your answer to include any books that you find particularly interested but haven\u2019t equally gifted, if at all.\u00a0 given that, i would add the black swan and fooled by randomness, both by nassim taleb.\u00a0 the black swan in particular is the one that caught my attention", "with that, folks, i am going to wrap up.\u00a0 i hope you found this entertaining, or interesting, or useful, ideally both.\u00a0 please let me know what you thought.\u00a0 i can be reached on the twitters @tferriss.\u00a0 let me know.\u00a0 just put #qanda, and let me know what you thought of this because this is, of course, somewhat time consuming.\u00a0 so if you liked this, i\u2019ll do more of these.\u00a0 i\u2019m happy to do it and drink more wine.\u00a0 if you\u2019re like, \u201cthat sucked.\u00a0 bring back pure interviews and i only want interviews,\u201d please let me know because i want to know", "for show notes, we will have links to everything that i just mentioned in this entire shindig.\u00a0 go to www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.\u00a0 until next time and as always, thank you my little darlings for listening.\u00a0 have a wonderful day or evening
