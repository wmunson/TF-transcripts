This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. If you\u2019re looking for perhaps some type of high-brow intellectual long-form conversation, you might want to go to tim.blog/podcast for one of my other long-form interviews. Kevin Rose: Don\u2019t sell us short, dude. Come on. Tim Ferriss: Hold on, Kevin. I haven\u2019t introduced you yet. But for those of you who enjoy the random, helter-skelter (is that a right word?) \u2013 Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think it is. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 nature \u2013 well, I\u2019m going to run with it, of the random show, which we haven\u2019t had an episode of for a very, very long time. It is a conversation between yours truly and my good friend, Kevin Rose. Kevin Rose: Guest No. 1 on The Tim Ferriss Show. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. You were Guest No. 1. The very first episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. Kevin Rose: Actually, that\u2019s in my LinkedIn bio now. It\u2019s my claim to fame. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s in your Google+ bio. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: We have not done a random show for a long time. But I\u2019ll let you do, if you want to do an introduction, of the random show. Kevin Rose: I don\u2019t think we even need to anymore. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t think we need to. Kevin Rose: We don\u2019t even know what episode we\u2019re on. Like, for those of you who have heard the random show before, I think we\u2019ve done probably, if I had to guess, I\u2019d say maybe 25 episodes? Tim Ferriss: Something like that \u2013 25 to 50 episodes. Kevin Rose: So we\u2019re Episode 27, let\u2019s call it. Tim Ferriss: Episode 27. Kevin, for people who don\u2019t know you, what\u2019s your story? What would you like people to know about you? Kevin Rose: That\u2019s a good question. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the speaker bio version of Kevin Rose? Kevin Rose: I don\u2019t even know these days. No, seriously, I would say that I\u2019ve been a long-time internet entrepreneur. I probably am best known for creating the social news website Digg back in 2004. That grew to become a pretty big entity for a number of years. Then I was at Google as an investor and now I\u2019m at True Ventures as an investor. Tim, you and I have probably co-invested on maybe a dozen or so angel deals? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, at least. Kevin Rose: Facebook together. I think Twitter together. Tim Ferriss: Twitter together, Blue Bottle Coffee together. Kevin Rose: Yeah, a bunch of them. Tim Ferriss: Side note: do you remember how ridiculed we all were when the consortium of techies and non-techies invested in Blue Bottle Coffee? Do you remember how much shit we got on the internet for that? Kevin Rose: Yeah, absolutely. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhy would Blue Bottle need to raise money?\u201d But it\u2019s done okay. It had a great exit here just about a month ago. Tim Ferriss: It has done all right. It was, what, a majority stake acquisition by Nestl\u00e9 for $700 million or so. So, it worked out. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it worked out. Tim Ferriss: So, you\u2019ve done very well as an investor. You are obsessed with many things Japanese. You have a new obsession, it seems, every few weeks. Do you have anything new to add? Actually, I want to hear about the fast mimicking diet. Because this is something \u2013 I would have put money on you never sticking with the fast mimicking diet and maybe you can explain for people what that means. But you\u2019ve actually now done a number of scheduled 5-day? Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. 5-day FMD. I\u2019ll start by saying that probably the reason why, Tim, you and I are friends \u2013 I met you when you were launching your first book on your boat party that you did. You rented out a warship in the San Francisco Bay. Tim Ferriss: The S.S. Jeremiah, where they recorded a lot of the boiler room audio for the James Cameron movie, Titanic, in fact. Kevin Rose: Oh, crazy. That\u2019s awesome. But we hit it off because we both love all kinds of this idea of lifelong learning I think has been a theme that you and I both enjoy. I\u2019ve certainly got really into biohacking in the last couple years. I\u2019ve watched you from afar poke and prod yourself and squirt all different kinds of juices out of your elbow. Tim Ferriss: This requires a little bit of explanation. This is so gross. But now I have to explain it. I had a botched PRP injection, which is platelet-rich plasma injection, in my right elbow. People can look up PRP. It actually has some fantastic applications. But there was a botched injection, which pushed effectively subcutaneous bacteria into the elbow capsule itself and it turned into this horrible infection that required debridement and surgery and so on. But Kevin, being the good friend that he is, came to visit me in the ER when I was having \u2013 I\u2019m not sure you would call is synovial fluid \u2013 the infection fluid \u2013 Kevin Rose: It was the pus drained out of your elbow, basically. Tim Ferriss: The pus drained out of my elbow with this gigantic syringe. Being the mature adult that I am, I thought it would be funny to take this turkey baster-worth of elbow fluid out of the sharps container and squirt it at Kevin, who was in the room. I\u2019m not proud of it, but I don\u2019t regret it, either. So, yes, you\u2019ve seen me do a lot and make a lot of short-term decisions that haven\u2019t turned out very well in the world of biohacking. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s always entertaining though. Got to say. Had a lot of fun doing stupid shit together. But speaking of, well, probably not that dumb these days, but fasting. So, I got into fasting here probably about three years ago, two and a half to three years ago. I started fasting app Zero, which is a free fasting tracker. That has really kind of blown up and taken off. But then I started hearing about the research from Dr. Valter Longo. It actually was from a friend of mine, you know Mike Mazur, a mutual friend of ours. Tim Ferriss: Yup. Kevin Rose: Mike was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. He went into chemotherapy treatment and he was one of the guys that said, I\u2019m not going to just take what they give me, but I\u2019m going to go out and do my own research and see what else I can be doing to help fight this and beat this down. One of the things that came up was this idea of doing these 5-day FMDs. FMD stays for fasting mimicking diet. The idea is that compliance of doing a standard 5-day fast is relatively low. It\u2019s am extremely difficult thing to do. Tim, have you ever done a 5-day water-only fast? Have you tried? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I\u2019ve done 5, 7, and 10-day. Kevin Rose: I\u2019ve done a 5-day water-only, and I will tell you, it is absolutely brutal. I don\u2019t know what your experience was, but I had a really difficult time sleeping. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there\u2019s a, I believe it\u2019s a cholinergic effect that leads you have rapid heartbeat quite often, when you\u2019re trying to sleep. It\u2019s not pleasant. So, you\u2019ll be exhausted and you\u2019ll lay down in bed and you\u2019ll feel like you just ran a 100-meter sprint in terms of heartbeat. It\u2019s very unpleasant. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s kind of scary. I\u2019m also one of those people that get those early heartbeats, where you feel like your heart skips a beat. They\u2019re completely benign. I\u2019ve had it looked at it and everything\u2019s fine, but I get those every once in a while and those come more frequently when I\u2019m in a fasted state. So, long story short, Mike does this 5-day fast. He beats back cancer. He\u2019s in full remission, which is awesome. But the idea with the 5-day fast \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Can I interrupt you one more time? I think this, I don\u2019t think Mike would mind this, but I remember you and I when we were talking about this \u2013 did he do 5 or 3? I can\u2019t recall. Kevin Rose: I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right. He did 3. Tim Ferriss: He did 3. Just for those who are curious, I\u2019ve had conversations with Dominic D\u2019Agostino before on this podcast. He\u2019s a very well-published researcher. I was first introduced to the possibility that fasting prior to chemotherapy, I believe, and reduction, it could be either, has the potential to increase the resilience of normal cells while increasing the susceptibility or weakness of cancer cells to facilitate this type of treatment, but also to decrease the side effect that are commonly experienced. So, Mike, t my understanding, would do a 3-day fast before a session and while the other people in his cohort were laid out on the couch or in bed the next day, he\u2019d be running a 10-mile training run. Kevin Rose: Right, which is just insane. Tim Ferriss: Which is nuts. Kevin Rose: Yeah, and so he originally when he got turned on to this research by Dr. Longo, he showed me this YouTube video where they were giving rats chemotherapy. The rats that were fasted were just running around the cage. They looked like normal, healthy rats. The ones that didn\u2019t fast were just, like you said, on their side, all beat up and in a horrible state. That\u2019s exactly what Mike experienced. The idea is that making the chemotherapy more effective is that you\u2019re depriving the cancer cells of some nutrients, certainly sugar, less glucose, and it makes them more susceptible to the chemotherapy treatments, so the chemotherapy is that much more effective. Obviously, we can\u2019t say for certain whether that\u2019s what put him into remission, but he\u2019s really happy that it did work. He is in remission and the evidence looks pretty compelling in humans. They\u2019re also extending this whole protocol to healthy individuals as a way to potentially prevent cancer from even forming in the first place. I was turned onto Dr. Valter Longo\u2019s new book, The Longevity Diet. I had him on my podcast. Have you see this book yet? Tim Ferriss: I have seen that. I haven\u2019t read it, but I have seen it. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s pretty awesome. There\u2019s a whole chapter on his FMD protocol and what you need to do these 5-day fasts, getting into what it actually is. How it differs from a water-only fast is that you do have calories. So, you have around 700 calories or so per day. Some people say that sounds like a lot. Some people say it sounds like a little. It\u2019s actually not much food. It\u2019s like a handful of small soup and some crackers. The first day, it\u2019s so not bad. You\u2019re like, oh, I can do this. Like, some crackers and a little bit of soup. Then day two and day three, and you\u2019re like, oh, my God, I\u2019m dying, right? But it\u2019s not nearly as bad as water-only. But the idea is that you eat just enough good to still get into this fasted state. So, all of your inflammation markers, all of the different markers that they\u2019re looking at in your blood, they look just like you\u2019re doing a water-only fast, but with a minimal amount of food. So, you have a little bit of, not as much hunger, and a little bit more energy. And so the compliance is much higher. Tim Ferriss: Were you tracking \u2013 when you do these FMDs, have you tracked your ketone levels at all? Do you get into ketosis or does the small amount of carbohydrate and so on that you\u2019re consuming keep you out of ketosis? Kevin Rose: I get a mild, I would say I get around .5 or so millimolars, so it\u2019s a very mild \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right on the edge. Kevin Rose: Right, which is kind of brutal because you\u2019re kind of in the keto flu-symptom area. So, you\u2019re not fully into ketosis. This is really interesting because Peter Attia, who you\u2019ve had on the show a few times, he\u2019s my doctor and I know you work with him as well. We played around with this protocol in that Attia has put together an FMD diet that is a lot more ketogenic friendly. So, a lot heavier on the fats and a lot less on the refined carbohydrates. So, for example, when you\u2019re doing Longo\u2019s version of this diet, and he actually has a nonprofit called ProLon, so you\u2019d actually just order this kit. So, I get a kit in the mail that has all the pre-packaged food. If you\u2019re watching the video version of this, this is what it looks like here. I just happen to have one. This is Day 5. Tim Ferriss: What does the nonprofit do with the money they get? Because it looks very \u2013 Kevin Rose: It goes back into research. Tim Ferriss: It goes back into research. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. Longo doesn\u2019t receive any of the money at all. He doesn\u2019t take a salary. This is meant for people that want to create a little autophagy, a little cell death, generate new stem cells, which he has proven actually happens via this 5-day method. The thing that hooked me though is I have had an elevated cholesterol on my whole father\u2019s side of the family. That\u2019s turned into heart disease with my Dad and him passing away from a heart attack. My Grandpa passed away from a heart attack. My Grandma on my Dad\u2019s side passed away from a heart attack. So, it\u2019s running deep. It\u2019s a little bit scary. Now that I\u2019m 40, I\u2019ve got these pretty bad numbers. So much so that Attia has put me on Crestor, which is knocking back the bad cholesterol with the statin, but obviously I\u2019d prefer not to be on a statin. Anyway, long story short, because of his book, The Longevity Diet, I was reading through it and he said that he was seeing people that did the 5-day fast, they were improving their cholesterol numbers and they were getting more good cholesterol and less bad cholesterol. I was like, oh, that sounds interesting, I might as well give this a shot. But to give it a proper shot, you\u2019re supposed to do \u2013 and I talked to Longo about this \u2013 but three back-to-back 5-day fasts over three months, and then once a quarter. Tim Ferriss: So, there\u2019s like a loading phase of fasting, where you do whatever, the first week of each month for three months and then \u2013 Kevin Rose: It\u2019s the creatine of fasting. Tim Ferriss: Right, and then you do maintenance once a quarter thereafter. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Kevin Rose: Yeah, so I did the first 5-day fast three months ago. I had my bloodwork drawn pre and post. Small minor improvements. Second fast, same thing. Then by the third, we actually saw a dramatic drop on a few different fronts cholesterol-wise. Attia, when he called me up, because we do these little calls to go over my bloodwork, he was like, \u201cKevin, you\u2019re going to live to 90 if you can keep this up. This is amazing.\u201d He was shocked. He was blown away. We\u2019re pretty happy with the results. We\u2019ll see how long they stick. This is no dietary changes. Granted, there\u2019s a dietary change during those five days, but no long-term. I\u2019m still kind of sticking to the same diet that I\u2019ve always been sticking to. Tim Ferriss: I like that he was so specific with 90. That\u2019s lower than I would\u2019ve expected, so it must be all the meth that you\u2019re doing that\u2019s going to kill you. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I still do a dose of meth every now and then. Actually, speaking of meth, dude, I just did some L-theanine for the first time today. Have you tried this with coffee? Tim Ferriss: It is very interesting stuff, to be sure. Kevin Rose: Oh, my God, dude. I\u2019d never tried it before. I took a pill, 200 milligrams this morning, and I was out with a mutual friend, Tony Conrad. We met for coffee and I gave him a pill too. We were like cracked out for like three hours, man. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so this observing of the biohacking is a mutual arrangement that Kevin and I have. It\u2019s not just him watching squirting fluid out of my elbow. I also observe things that you do. On the FMD though, just to return to that for a second, you mentioned in passing that Attia had looked at the possibility of doing a lower-carbohydrate, higher-fat version. Kevin Rose: He actually has a protocol for that, yeah. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d give you the pdf if you ask for it for the podcast notes. Tim Ferriss: Have you tried it? Kevin Rose: I did. I did that for the second one. I liked it, actually I just happened to buy a 3-pack of the ProLon kit, so I wanted to go through them and use because they\u2019re not cheap and so I just used that for the last one. But I like Attia\u2019s in that it\u2019s a little bit more work, obviously, because you\u2019re preparing your own food, but his is different in that with ProLon you get these little, tiny snacks throughout the entire day. With his, it\u2019s one meal a day and it\u2019s just a salad. It\u2019s greens and three tablespoons or four tablespoons of olive oil and like six olives and some sunflower seeds. It\u2019s not a whole lot, but it certainly gives you \u2013 but it\u2019s not as refined. So, I saw my ketone levels go up on his. I certainly had more energy on his versus the ProLon. Tim Ferriss: Got it. I\u2019ll ping Peter about that. It makes sense on multiple levels that you would have higher ketone levels. For people who are wondering how one would measure ketone levels, I think you and I still use the same device, which is the Precision Xtra by Abbott Labs, which does a sufficient job in measuring something called BHB, beta hydroxybutyrate in the blood. For a number of different reasons, this is a much more precise and accurate, let\u2019s just call is precise, but consistently precise \u2014 maybe it\u2019s accurate, maybe it isn\u2019t \u2013 method of measuring ketones or the degree to which you\u2019re in ketosis than pee sticks. Because as your body becomes, or if you\u2019re already very efficient at using ketone bodies, you could show a false negative. Where you pee on the stick and it tells you you\u2019re not in ketosis, when in fact you are. So, the blood is just more accurate. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to live 90. That makes me happy. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it was a pretty cool experiment and certainly for someone who has heart disease running in their family, I\u2019m going to keep it up. I\u2019m going to do another blood draw here next week to see where my levels are at and then I\u2019m trying to do this quarterly. Hopefully, if we can get it down to where I won\u2019t be using statins any longer, that\u2019d be great. Tim Ferriss: The last time we did a random show, it was a very, very long time ago, I believe. I was at least before you had a little monkey in your house. A reason, many reasons, of course, to stick around, but now a very compelling new reason. So, how would you describe \u2013 since certainly I have no kids that I\u2019m aware of at this point \u2013 Kevin Rose: That\u2019s a good disclaimer there. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t have kids \u2013 *that I know of. What have been the biggest changes that you\u2019ve felt or observed in yourself or otherwise? How you view the world? Anything like that now that you have a kid? And what is your kid\u2019s name? Kevin Rose: Zelda. She\u2019s four months old. She\u2019s named after the video game because one of the first things that my wife and I bonded on very early in our relationship was our love for the game Zelda. Actually, the new Zelda game allows you to track your hours played. It actually shows it in the little settings menu. Darya has over 200 hours played of the latest Zelda. She\u2019s hardcore. She played a lot during her pregnancy. Tim Ferriss: She\u2019s a true believer. And when we were in Japan a long time ago, Darya was using some time of emulator, I don\u2019t know what device it was on exactly, but she was playing Zelda on all the trains when we were sitting down and chilling. That\u2019s one thing I remember. Kevin Rose: The original. Yeah, Josh Cook was too. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s fun to play the original ones with those old-school emulators. But yeah, in terms of her, it\u2019s hard for, I think, a guy in that when you have your first child, there\u2019s not a whole lot to do. There\u2019s just a lot of crying. I tried to help out where I can but rly she was on her mom\u2019s hip for the first several weeks and there\u2019s a lot of getting used to new things. Now, it\u2019s just amazing, dude. You walk into a room and she lights up when she sees me for the first time. She smiles and giggles. It kind of changes the way that I want to approach life in terms of what things are important and trying to make more time to be a good father. For someone like myself that has so many varying interests and certainly can get sucked into new things pretty easily, I\u2019ve been trying to be a little bit more thoughtful about where and when I spend my energy so that I can kind of dial back. I\u2019ve spent a good portion of this year trying to live a little bit more of a minimalist lifestyle. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the steps that you\u2019ve taken to do that? I feel like you and I have had this conversation every year since we first met. But now, you actually have a gigantic incentive to follow through. Kevin Rose: Well, it\u2019s funny. Every time Tim and I get together, it\u2019s like oh, man. I\u2019ve got too many investments. I\u2019m doing this. There\u2019s too many things going on. I\u2019ve got to spend my time here. We\u2019re always more or less complaining to each other of us taking on too many things. It\u2019s so ridiculous. So, I\u2019ve just been trying to implement a few rules. One of the things I did starting January 1st was to throw away or donate something every single day. So, I have forced myself to go in and \u2013 for example, I went in and I just picked out all the clothes that I haven\u2019t touched in a year and I took them down the street, like half a block away is a donation place, and I donated anything that I hadn\u2019t worn in a year. It really thins out your closet. Tim Ferriss: Was that easy for you to do? Kevin Rose: Yes, absolutely. Tim Ferriss: It was? There was no resistance? You weren\u2019t like, \u201cBut that\u2019s the sweater that my Auntie Janie gave me.\u201d Kevin Rose: Who\u2019s the lady you had on your podcast that wrote that book? Tim Ferriss: Marie Kondo. Technically, Marie Kondo is how they would say it in Japanese, but Marie Kondo. Kevin Rose: Marie Kondo. Yeah, she\u2019s awesome. I listed to her audiobook and one of the things that she says in her audiobook is that \u201cThe way that you can depart with something is to realize that it has already taught you its lesson. That lesson may be that it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d If you have it hanging in your closet and you look at it and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, but someday I might\u2026.\u201d No, the lesson is that it spent its time with you, it wasn\u2019t for you, and it should go to\u00a0 good home where it can be appreciated by someone else. My lesson is not to buy it again. I took that and I\u2019ve applied that to thinning out pretty much everything in my life. I think a lot of people, there\u2019s this analysis paralysis thing where you think about cleaning out the garage or you\u2019re thinking about doing this massive overhaul in your life and you\u2019re like, it\u2019s the weekend, I\u2019ve got to do this. There\u2019s always something that jumps in front of it in terms of priorities. For me, I find that if I just say, okay, one thing a day. At the end of year, I may not be to my goal, but after five years, I certainly will. It\u2019s not like I have that much stuff. But really saying, do I need this in my life? Is it bringing joy to my life? It\u2019s such a good forcing function to get rid of a lot of stuff. Everything you get rid of is actually less of a mental load on you. There was this old tea master that I met one time. Tim and I have done some crazy travels all throughout China in tea lands. Tim Ferriss: Oh, the stories we could tell. Kevin Rose: Seriously. We\u2019ve done some crazy stuff in the middle of the Yunnan province. Nothing sexual. That was our friend. We had a friend that did something. So, long story short, the one thing that this tea master showed me was he pulled out of his pocket one key. He showed me the one key. He goes, \u201cKevin, do you know what this is?\u201d I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s a key.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s the key to my house. This is my one key. I\u2019ve worked my entire life to have one key.\u201d Because we can all have multiple keys. Meaning the things that you purchase. Whether you have a key to your boat or your spare garage or a motorcycle or whatever it may be. There\u2019s things in your life that you accumulate and the least amount of burden and the most happiness you can get is having less stuff to worry about. And so I find that to be really true. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to focus on is having less and being happy with a handful of high-quality things. Tim Ferriss: I also want to mention that it\u2019s possible to read a book like Marie Kondo\u2019s book, which I can never remember the title of it. I want to say The Magic Art of Japanese Tidying Up, but no, it\u2019s something close. It\u2019s like The Art of, The Joy of Magic Cleaning Up. I can never remember the exact phrasing. I don\u2019t know why. But in any case, that cult following with her book leads some readers to think it\u2019s an all-or-nothing, take-it-or-leave-it approach. You, on the other hand, have philosophically found bits and pieces of that book that are very useful to you but are tactically doing the opposite of what she recommends, but it works for you. So, she recommends doing this once-in-a-lifetime tidying Super Bowl, basically, where you block out two or three days of your life and that\u2019s what you do and then the rest is maintenance. It\u2019s kind of like the Fast Mimicking Diet of Japanese tidying. You have this loading phase. I\u2019ve had this book \u2013 I actually am looking at it on my bookshelf right now \u2013 for like two years. I\u2019m just like, \u201cMan, I\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d Then I\u2019m like, two to three days? I look at my calendar and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019m just not going to do it.\u201d I like the idea tactically of one at a time. One per day. Also, what\u2019s helped me, because I have actually been, since I moved to Austin not too long ago, it\u2019s been a great opportunity after boxing everything up. Okay, do I really want to box all this stuff or do I just want to donate a lot of this because it might be from a 1 to 10 scale of value a 2 to me, or maybe a 1, maybe a 3. But I could donate this very to Goodwill or somewhere else to say a high school gym that needs equipment, which is something I\u2019ve done in the past, and it\u2019s an immediate 8, 9, or 10. It\u2019s a nice karmic chess move to donate. You think of not what you\u2019re losing, but also what you\u2019re giving to someone else in that respect, which I find really helpful. So you\u2019re giving away one item per day. Kevin Rose: The other thing, too, I will tell you along those lines is that if there is a purchase that I want to make that is not just what I would consider to be a necessity like toilet paper or whatever it may be, and it\u2019s something that is luxury, not luxury but in the sense of it\u2019s going to cost you over $100, and I don\u2019t necessarily need it, but I kind of want to try it, what I do is I save for later on Amazon. So you can add and say save for later. Set a reminder in your calendar app for a week or two weeks later. Almost 90 percent of the time I end up not buying that thing. I still have one thing in there actually from you. It\u2019s that NAC supplement. Should I buy that? I haven\u2019t bought it yet? Tim Ferriss: Well, NAC, I should say with all of this stuff that we\u2019re discussing because it bears repeating. We are not doctors; we don\u2019t play them on the internet. Everybody should assume that at least 50 percent of what we\u2019re saying is complete fucking nonsense and we are just not sure which 50 percent it is. So, work with a qualified professional before you start taking or stopping any type of medication or supplement. The NAC came to me initially because I was looking at it as a means to accelerate recovery between workouts. My understanding \u2013 I might be getting this wrong \u2013 but is that it is a precursor to glutathione, which some people think of as this master antioxidant or upstream antioxidant that a host of beneficial effects. What I noticed in taking the NAC is that I was over the period of a week to 10 days, perhaps seven, eight days into it, that I was more even-keeled than was typical. Like the week had been very smooth. I hadn\u2019t change anything else that I could identify. I\u2019d been either meditating or not meditating for a series of weeks. There were a lot of constants. When I went onto PubMed and began to look at N-Acetyl Cysteine and search for other terms, like \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201cbipolar,\u201d and so on, there were a number of search results that popped up that seemed to indicate to me that there was some promise in using NAC to mitigate the amplitude of the ups and downs that could be associated with bipolar. That\u2019s the primary reason that, for period of time, and I cycle off of all of these things. I became very fascinated by NAC, which quite nicely does have potentially recovery benefits from an athletic standpoint, although most of my athletic prowess has been focused on eating oatmeal cookies recently, so I can\u2019t really claim that I\u2019m doing a lot of killer workouts. I got Rhabdo from eating oatmeal cookies. For you CrossFitters out there, that\u2019s for you. The other would be something you and I are both familiar with, which is low-dose lithium orotate, very, very low-dose lithium orotate, 5 mgs, which you can find on Amazon and elsewhere. There\u2019s a great New York Times article which people can find very easily that is titled along the lines of \u201cMaybe We All Just Need a Little Bit of Lithium.\u201d It talks about the inverse correlation of groundwater concentrations of lithium with, I want to say at least reported, suicide, homicide, manic depression, and so on. Those two, for me, function in tandem or at least appeal to me for very similar reasons. So, the NAC, should you use it or not, I think is a question of whether you feel you need it. For me, at least currently, I get asked all the time, what are your Top 10 supplements that you\u2019re using right now? Because people have this impression after reading The 4-Hour Body and so on that I walk around with a drip IV bag in my arm and have a thousand pills I\u2019m taking four times a day. Kevin Rose: Well, I\u2019ve certainly seen you in that mode. Tim Ferriss: You have seen me in that mode, but my mode right now is to really ensure that I am using supplements as supplements. That I\u2019m not using them to absolve me of the responsibility to eat proper food, for instance. It\u2019s like look, if you\u2019re drinking a lot and you\u2019re like compulsively watching porn and not exercising and mainlining Pixie sticks for your diet and you\u2019re like, \u201cWow, I\u2019m depressed. Maybe I should take 15 different supplements.\u201d It\u2019s like no, you need to fucking fix the rest of your life and then see what your baseline is because you\u2019re creating so much static and noise and garbage inputs that you don\u2019t even know what your baseline is. It\u2019s so disguised with sort of the trauma and confusion of your inputs. Kevin Rose: Do you track your baseline? Do you log what you consume and what you take? Tim Ferriss: This is going to sound so primitive and it is, but my baseline is really how do I feel when I wake up? Do I want to stay in bed because I don\u2019t want to face the day? Am I anxious? Are those my first thoughts coming out of bed? Assuming that I\u2019m not checking my phone, right? Because it\u2019s really my starting state out of the gate of sleep to wakefulness. Then at night, how much trouble do I have sleeping? If any. Or do I fall asleep easily? How deep is my sleep? So for deepness of sleep, you could certainly use something like an aura ring or an accelerometer. There are different means by which you could try to assess the quality of your sleep. But for me, really looking at how consistently I feel good waking up and how long it takes me to get up to say first or second gear. It historically has taken me a long time to go from park to second or third gear. Some people wake up \u2013 you might be one of these people \u2013 they\u2019re like, \u201cFuck it, world! Here I am! I\u2019m ready to party!\u201d That\u2019s not me. I have a real slow build. Kevin Rose: I think in between you and that. I\u2019m definitely not ready to party the second I wake up. I am after coffee. I have a cup of coffee, I\u2019m ready to party. Tim Ferriss: I feel that way, if, for instance, I\u2019m in ketosis, past about 2 millimolars. I need less sleep. So, let\u2019s call it six versus eight hours. And when I take up, I am awake. Versus feeling groggy for an hour or two, hour and a half. Which can be remedied somewhat by the psychological advantage of exercising in the morning, which is one thing I\u2019ve been scheduling to do more of per Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL commander and all-around intense dude. Kevin Rose: Badass. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Intense, accomplished guy. People can find him at tim.blog/jocko. Jocko\u2019s first-ever public interview. I\u2019m thrilled to have unleashed the giant, white gorilla on the internet. Baseline though, to return to your question, is really something I try to keep as simple as possible. Do I and have I measured all of those other things? Yes. But I think that whether it\u2019s with your body or with a business, or any number of other things, it\u2019s really easy to become addicted to measuring things that don\u2019t matter very much. Or worse still, measuring things that will distract you from the things that do matter. Does that make sense? Kevin Rose: Yeah, that totally makes sense. I\u2019ve tried to pare it down to just the stuff I really care about. I just sent you a link in our video chat to my dashboard for the things I measure every day. So, for me, I\u2019m really concerned about my glucose levels because they are a tiny bit elevated. So, I do waking glucose, bedtime glucose. I do whether I meditated that day or not. I do how many hours I fasted the night prior. I do how many drinks I\u2019ve had and then I do what type of workout, whether I had tea or coffee that day, and then my food. But food not in terms of a by-the-calorie, super-anal kind of breakdown, but really just typing out what I ate for that day as a way to hold myself accountable and just look over the last few days at a glance and see if I\u2019ve been behaving or not. So, I find that just the act of writing it down makes me behave a little bit better. Tim Ferriss: It does. Okay, that was going to be my question. How does that actually impact your behavior? Kevin Rose: This is a fascinating question. I did an experiment here about three weeks ago with a group of five friends. I created this spreadsheet that we all logged into every single day. What you do is you record the number of drinks you had the night before. I was thinking about turning this into an app, although I\u2019m not going to do it. But I was interested in trying to create social pressure to drink less. Not to drink more, but to drink less. The thing that I found that was really interesting is that if you drink over two drinks in a night, people have some shame in reporting that, so they will mis-report. If you went out and you had four, five drinks, it\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the guy who had four drinks.\u201d Tim Ferriss: The one asshole on the spreadsheet. Kevin Rose: Right, exactly. So, I changed it then so the spreadsheet would only say 2+. So that\u2019s the max you could go. Then people were more open to being like, \u201cYeah, I had 2+ last night.\u201d They were a lot more at ease, but it still created a little bit of social pressure and personal pressure if you looked at your list and you\u2019re like, \u201cOoh, there\u2019s been four nights of 2+ there. I should probably do a night without drinking.\u201d So, my idea was to create an app that would allow you just to say up to 2+ and see all of your friends in the same arena and then hopefully encourage you to be able to drink socially but not take it too far. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this brings up all sorts of really fascinating and frustrated methodological questions in terms of designing this type of reporting, right? Because I was thinking to myself as you were saying this, well, if you had a larger group, say a group of 200 people, one would expect you would have more people in that group reporting drinking 2, 3, 4 drinks on any given night. So, the shame factor would be decreased, but if you decrease the shame factor, that also decreases the incentive to actually behave, right? Because you can blend into this perceived acceptability of being like well, there are 10 other people out of 200 who had four drinks last night. That\u2019s totally fine. Kevin Rose: Well, the question is, how well do you know the people? So, how tight are they in your social connections in your peer group? Like Brenden Mulligan \u2013 I\u2019ll call him out because he\u2019s a friend of ours. He works at Google. He never drinks. He has like one drink. One drink. One drink every four days or whatever. Seeing him hit those streaks of like zero drinks, zero drinks, that was also a pretty powerful thing. I\u2019m saying I need to be more like Brenden. I need to dial it back. So, it goes both ways. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. I suppose if you\u2019re seeing friends of yours doing well who have demanding jobs, demanding relationships, you can\u2019t use that as your excuse when you have the data right in front of you showing that they\u2019re actually behaving. So, you historically have been a non-trivial drinker, let\u2019s call it. Like a minor league all-star of booze consumption. Kevin Rose: I used to drink a lot more, to be honest. You can see my spreadsheet here. Tim Ferriss: So, what has helped you most to decrease the amount that you drink? Kevin Rose: Well, I think there is fear. I\u2019ve seen a bunch of studies, there was one that was just published here a couple weeks ago, the largest study ever around dementia and alcohol abuse. They\u2019ve very closely linked, which is really frightening. I think wanting to live longer for my daughter is another one, back to the point you had earlier about what has changed. And just getting older. Hangovers happen at 2.5 drinks these days. Why roll the dice? For me, to get to your question around what have I done differently, there\u2019s a couple things. One, I\u2019ve set aside time to learn at night, which I think is really important. You really can\u2019t drink and learn at the same time. Tim Ferriss: Or remember what you attempt to learn. Kevin Rose: Exactly. The second thing that has been huge for me though has been the sauna. The sauna has been massive because it is like four drinks or three drinks, just by going and doing a 30-minute, high-intense heat sauna session. You come home and you sleep like a baby. If you don\u2019t have a sauna, that can also be substituted with a really hot bath. It\u2019s always been about I\u2019m with my wife, I\u2019m sitting down, and we\u2019re going to crack open a bottle of wine, and I\u2019ll have a couple glasses of wine. It\u2019s never been like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s go party!\u201d Those days are long gone. Like a decade-plus gone. No, don\u2019t look at me like that! Tim Ferriss: A decade-plus? Kevin Rose: Listen, if we\u2019re out traveling together, Tim, we\u2019re going to have fun, right? Tim Ferriss: Okay. Kevin Rose: So, the only times you and I hang is when we\u2019re traveling together, so you can\u2019t put that on me. Tim Ferriss: All right, fair enough. We\u2019re in different cities now. I will say, for those people who are like, wait \u2013 they can see each other? We are doing a very intimate video chat on Skype that you will be able to see on my YouTube channel, youtube.com/timferriss. Kevin is dressed for success, I will note. Kevin Rose: I just had a park meeting this morning, so we dress up a little bit. Tim Ferriss: I appreciate it. So, I gave you that look. Traveling is a bit of an exception. How do you prevent yourself \u2013 you have traveled a lot. In some cases, historically. Now, that may change with your daughter, but how do you prevent that from becoming the excuse to drink that happens frequently? Does that make sense? Because this happens in all sorts of capacities, right? Where people will say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re traveling, you should eat pizza every night.\u201d I hear that and I\u2019m like if I followed that role, I\u2019d be Jabba the Hut, because I end up traveling so much. If I allowed myself that out, it would become a real problem. Kevin Rose: Yeah, traveling is difficult, especially when it\u2019s in a social setting. If you combine traveling with social. I\u2019ll be going to TED in a couple weeks and I know that there\u2019s just going to be a lot of parties and a lot of events and a lot of drinking. I think that\u2019s one of the things that I need to work on is that I have a hard time dealing with large groups of people that I don\u2019t know. As a social lubricant, alcohol is amazing, right? It\u2019s like, what else can we do? I think that someone was telling me that you never really strengthen that muscle if you\u2019re leaning on the crutch of alcohol. So, you\u2019re never going to become more comfortable with new humans and new interactions and new ways of breaking the ice if you always just go to the booze, right? So, I think of it like, this is my workout that I\u2019m going into. I\u2019ve got a couple little hacks. One is to show up a little bit late, so then you skip a drink, right? It\u2019s funny how if you skip a drink or two and you get there and people are already a little hammered, how unattractive and unappealing drinking then becomes. Because you look at everyone\u2019s like, \u201cHey, good to see you!\u201d And it\u2019s a little bit sloppy. You look at that and you\u2019re like, okay, they\u2019re relaxed. They\u2019re not going to remember what I said anyway, not that they\u2019re that hammered, but you know what I mean. They\u2019re in their relaxed state. So, I can be a little bit more jokey and be myself and not have to worry about being hammered. That\u2019s a big piece of it. When I\u2019m at home, you\u2019re going to laugh at this, but on Amazon, I bought these \u2013 speaking of buying more things that I\u2019m probably going to throw away in a year \u2013 I bought these measuring cups that measure out exactly one glass of wine. So, what I do there is a bottle of wine we all know is kind of, like a half bottle of wine is kind of two and a half, maybe, it\u2019s up there. It\u2019s very easy, like Darya will have a little bit less than me and I\u2019ll say, okay, I\u2019ll wait until it gets halfway and then I\u2019ll stop, you know? But you\u2019re actually drinking more than you think. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, plus with a wine glass, if you have a large wine glass, you can think like a third of a bottle or close to half a bottle very easily. Kevin Rose: Right, exactly. So, what I do now is I bought this measuring glass off of Amazon. I fill that perfectly, pour it in, get my second glass, fill it perfectly and pour it in. So, that\u2019s all of my alcohol for the night. It stops me at two drinks, and I really take my time with it then. I have dinner. I slowly sip it. I look at it. I go sit down. We might watch a little John Oliver or something and then continue to sip on it. That\u2019s my way of locking in. I know no more past that. It prevents any hangovers. My doctor says it\u2019s pretty good for you to have a glass or two a night. Then also \u2013 dude, don\u2019t laugh at me! It is good for you! Ish. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll go with ish. Kevin Rose: No, but then it\u2019s also taking nights off altogether. I think that\u2019s the other big piece of it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Good for you, man. I love it. Now, you mentioned one other thing. Well, actually a couple of other points because I\u2019ve been also cutting back on alcohol quite a bit. I still enjoy alcohol. Not gonna lie. I do have booze on occasion. Kevin Rose: I love your drunk \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Oh, the drunk dials? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Those are fun. For those who don\u2019t know, occasionally, I do these drunk-dial episodes. It\u2019s the laziest podcast format thought up, I think to date, perhaps, which is I have listeners fill out a Google form with their contact info and I set a time, like a two-hour window where I will call people via Skype and starting drinking at Call 1 and drink all the way through to say Call 10 and get progressively more inebriated as I answer questions. That is fun. I did one about a week ago. It was a good time. Then I thought I should do another episode today. I was like, I just don\u2019t want to do two nights of sipping tequila on Skype. A few things that have also helped me. No. 1 is, and this is not an excuse everyone is going to be comfortable using, but if I go to a party and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, man. You\u2019re not drinking? What the fuck?\u201d I\u2019ll be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m on a bunch of weird drugs. I am not really supposed to drink alcohol right now.\u201d Kevin Rose: Oh, that stops the conversation right there. That\u2019s brilliant. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, well it stops the push. But then it also starts another conversation like, \u201cWell, what kind of weird shit are you on?\u201d At any given point, I think it\u2019s fair to say that I could answer in the affirmative to \u201cAre you on any weird shit?\u201d I\u2019m almost always doing something odd. It might not be a lot of stuff, but I\u2019m probably trying something new. That stops people cold. If they\u2019re like, oh, wow. I mean, it could be Tylenol. If you\u2019re taking acetaminophen in any capacity, people may not realize this, but some absurd percentage of emergency room visits and liver failures are associated with high-dose acetaminophen, which is not that much. It\u2019s something like two or three times the label allowable amount over 24 hours. It\u2019s really a potent and potentially dangerous drug. So, that\u2019s one. \u201cI\u2019m actually on this.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m on A, B, or C,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m on a bunch of weird stuff at the moment and I\u2019m just not supposed to drink.\u201d It works really well. Then second, and this is actually advice that Richard Branson gave on this podcast is, having club soda with a dash of cranberry juice or something like that. Just using that as your default go-to. One thing that I do which is going to sound really odd and it is odd, but I have a superstition about \u201ccheers-ing,\u201d clinking glasses, when I don\u2019t have any alcohol in my glass. Kevin Rose: Interesting. This is your tell. Tim Ferriss: This is something that well, it\u2019s kind of a tell. But what I\u2019ll do is I will sometimes also go up to the bar and I\u2019ll say, just give me a tiny splash, like the equivalent amount that would be in a thimble or something like that and then I\u2019ll cut myself off at that. That\u2019s the amount that allow myself. That\u2019s another approach that I take to cut back on the booze. You mentioned though that you\u2019ve been trying to learn at night and that the booze is not conducive to learning at night. What are you trying to learn at night? What types of things? What\u2019s the format? Are you reading 100 pages a night or what is it? Kevin Rose: Honestly, have you heard of this Coursera course called \u201cLearning how to Learn\u201d? Tim Ferriss: I have not. Who teaches it? Kevin Rose: It\u2019s done by a couple professors. I\u2019m actually in the middle of that right now. Another kind of biohacker recommended it to me. Apparently, it\u2019s the No. 1 watched course on Coursera right now. It\u2019s just been fascinating how they dig into the science of learning and how you go on this kind of focused or diffused mode and how to really go in and concentrate on something and when the optimal time is to learn. It\u2019s all the science around learning. I\u2019m just getting started with it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been diving into and spending my nights watching those videos. But it talks about the importance of actually getting away from your material. So, getting really focused and setting a timer for 25 minutes maximum. Going really in depth on the course material and then backing away and going into this more relaxed mode. They were talking about, who was it? Benjamin Franklin? I can\u2019t remember who it was that used to hold a pair of keys in their hand. Salvador Dal\u00ed did this as well, actually. Hold a pair of keys in your hand and you kind of just go into this relaxed state thinking about what you want to learn, to where you almost fall asleep and when you drop the keys out of your hand and it wakes you up, that\u2019s when you go back and then you realize you were successful getting that relaxed. You\u2019ll retain and become more creative. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just fascinating stuff. I\u2019m just getting started with the course. And it\u2019s free. Tim Ferriss: Very cool. Yeah, the intervals and the duration of intervals for learning, along with break periods, is something that I\u2019ve experimented a lot with as it relates to language learning. Because it\u2019s so measurable, you can look at, say your recall of foreign vocabulary, assuming you\u2019re controlling for a few different variables, right? Adjectives are generally going to be harder than nouns, for instance. But if you\u2019re controlling for that, you can look at what your retention is, say 48 hours later, for 100 words you attempted to learn in one session versus two sessions versus three sessions with different types of breaks. I did that when I was looking at a few different languages, specifically in 2004, 2005. Actually, I\u2019ve never shown you these notes. I have text edit documents with all of my notes on language learning for about a year-long period, looking at all this type of stuff. There were some very clear patterns, such as focusing on the material right before bed with no interruption. Much like how it\u2019s recommended by many names both you and I know, that you meditate first thing in the morning before you brush your teeth, before you check your phone, before anything else. When you have this tabula rasa blank state of sorts. Focusing on material that you want to consolidate in memory and recall later right before bed, at least in my experience, dramatically improves recall. Then, this is actually very important, not just doing that, but when you wake up, before doing anything else, which for me would override meditation, doing a recall exercise of some type. I tend to use flashcards, to determine which have stuck and which have not. So those that have not, since I\u2019m looking at language, I would give myself like a quarter of a second. It couldn\u2019t be delayed because in speech, you\u2019re not going to have the luxury of sitting there paused for long periods of time. It would go back into the rotation for review again throughout that day and later that night. But that has proven really, really helpful. Kevin Rose: How about exercise? One of the things they mention in this course is this idea of doing cardiovascular exercise. I believe it\u2019s post-learning something new. Apparently, this science was saying that it just sticks that much more. I don\u2019t have any numbers in front of me, but it was something along those lines. Have you heard anything about that? Tim Ferriss: In terms of the timing of exercise, I have less clarity, but there\u2019s an entire book called Spark that talks about, among other things, the role of exercise in education and learning, and would point to things like BDNF, the release of brain drive neurotrophic factor, which can be elicited through different types of exercise. Part of me thinks that when one says because these are the easiest to study, or very often the easiest to study, cardiovascular exercise, this is where it comes down to trying to become literate with reading scientific studies or understanding how things typically work. As a couple of baselines, scientific studies usually use volunteer populations known as students. Those students have 45-minute class blocks or 60-minute class blocks. So, to keep those students busy, people are very often disincentivized from using shorter-duration, high-intensity training or something like that. Weightlifting, for instance. Resistance training. If you want to, as an experimenter, design something that requires as little monitoring as possible, it\u2019s like, all right, stick them on a stationary bike. If you have people doing burpees or deadlifts, like you actually need to \u2013 Kevin Rose: I hate burpees. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, but you actually need to pay attention, right? You need to pay attention if people are lifting weights and so on. There are more safety concerns. So, just to point out perhaps the obvious, weightlifting is actually one of the most cardiovascular activities you could possibly engage in, but I won\u2019t digress into that. You can look at a book called Body by Science for all of the details and why that is the case. But it would make sense to me that exercise could certainly play a role in increasing cognitive function. But one of the questions that I ask myself all the time, when, and this is a good question for people to ask themselves when they see a headline that makes a scientific claim, is what else could explain this? What else might explain this? If you\u2019re looking at cardiovascular exercise right after some type of cramming with material, you could make the argument that perhaps it\u2019s not the exercise at all, it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re going into a semi-mindless or meditative, repetitive period where they\u2019re able to, their subconscious somehow work on the material, right? Kevin Rose: Right. Well, this exactly what this course teaches is how to get into those periods. Yeah, 100 percent. Tim Ferriss: I have certainly seemed to observe that exercise in some capacity, for me, it\u2019s generally some type of resistance training, does have a positive effect on learning. So, yet another reason to get off your ass, which is something I need to do more of. I\u2019ve digressed. I\u2019ve fallen off the train a little bit, Kevin Rose. I\u2019ll be honest. But I shall get back on the train. Fortunately, once you have a recipe that works, you have the confidence that you can get back on. That\u2019s the good news, right? Say with the fast mimicking diet, not that you should use that for body composition, but fast mimicking diet or intermittent fasting, which a lot of people use your app Zero for, for slow carb diet, plus a handful of things like kettle ball swings. I just know this is why I\u2019m not stressed out about being off the rails. I kind of make fun of myself about it. Because it\u2019s like look, if I just follow the prescription, like follow the algorithm for three to four weeks, there\u2019s no magic involved. It will work and I will have less muffin top to grab when I\u2019m in the sauna, which will make me happy. Kevin Rose: Muffin top in the sauna is the worst. You look down and you see that little layer, this little boop. Tim Ferriss: You also have like the glistening Cinnabon effect because you\u2019re sweating. It\u2019s a really unattractive look. It\u2019s not a good look. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s not good. One thing I did want to talk about, which I think would be fun to chat about because we\u2019ve both done is, real quick, is Tony Robbins. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let\u2019s talk about it. For sure. So, I\u2019ve done two different Tony Robbins events. UPW, Unleash the Power Within, which was my first event. Then, more recently in December of this last year, Date with Destiny, which is a longer event. Kevin Rose: Oh, you did that? I didn\u2019t know you did Date with Destiny as well. Tim Ferriss: I did. So, I\u2019ve done two events. Some people have had a bit of exposure to Date with Destiny through the I am Not Your Guru documentary, which was co-produced, in fact, by someone who\u2019s been on this podcast, Brian Koppelman, a really accomplished filmmaker. But what was your experience like? Your first Tony Robbins event? Kevin Rose: It was kind of crazy. Thanks to you, I got hooked up with him. I went down and got a chance to meet him and hang out with him. I think that Tony has proven himself now that he\u2019s been doing this for so long. He\u2019s been doing it for 40+ years. But I think that in the back of my mind, I remember when I was a little kid, the audiotape version, infomercial version of Tony. So, there was always this stigma in my mind that was like, is he trying to sell me something? What\u2019s going on here? I also watched his documentary and I was like, wow, this guy is clearly brilliant. He takes this stuff very seriously and he\u2019s truly breaking through to people and helping people change their lives. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in the Bay Area, you should come down.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay, that sounds awesome.\u201d I took a buddy of mine that has a lot of anxiety. He shall go unnamed but he wanted to go. He was like, \u201cKevin, let\u2019s do this.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d So, we went down for the three-day event. I thought it was great. I\u2019ve got to tell you. You walk into it \u2013 and I was in arena where there was 12,000 people. There are a lot of people there. Everybody is coming there for a different reason, right? I was sitting across from a guy that had lost his legs and was previously a drug addict. I think he had some infection in his legs or something and had to have them both amputated. I was sitting next to someone that was running her own social media business and wanted to get better with her business and improve her finances. She was getting through a relationship that she had just ended. Everyone had something to bring to the table. Of course, we all do. If we\u2019re honest with ourselves, everyone has something they\u2019re trying to work on. I went in there and Day One was awesome. Tony got out there and he spoke for like 12 hours we were there. Until after midnight. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s a complete mutant. Yeah, it\u2019s unbelievable. Kevin Rose: I don\u2019t even know when he pees. I have no idea when he uses the bathroom. Tim Ferriss: Or drinks water. Yeah. He\u2019s just a machine, the guy\u2019s a machine. Kevin Rose: He\u2019s a machine. I walked over the coals with him. He was like, \u201cBring out some fresh coals for Kevin!\u201d Of course, they put like fresh, you actually walk over coals at the end of the night. You\u2019ve done this, right? Tim Ferriss: I have, yeah. Kevin Rose: Did he bring out fresh coals for you? Tim Ferriss: I can\u2019t recall if he brought out fresh coals for me. I think that might\u2019ve been the VIP treatment you received. Kevin Rose: It was a lot of fun. I think the biggest takeaway for me was really a couple things. One was definitely this thing called the wheel of life. Did you have to do that? Where you fill out your wheel? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sure I did. And I should also point out that for the attendees at these events \u2013 and I have a little bit more to say about this \u2013 but the exercises that really \u2013 and there are very tactical, prescriptive exercises \u2013 but that the exercises that change someone else\u2019s trajectory and give them extremely concrete next steps that have an impact, are very often completely different exercises from those that affect the person right next to you. It\u2019s really something to behold. But tell us about the wheel of life. Kevin Rose: The wheel of life was interesting in that he gives you these areas of your life and you\u2019re to rank them from 0 to 10 on how far along and how happy you are with those areas. So, for example, physical body. So, for me, I was like, for me, I give myself a 4 in this arena. I could be doing a lot better. Then there\u2019s emotions and meaning. Another one is relationships. Another one is time. Another one is your career and your mission in life. Then there\u2019s finances. Then the last one is how you contribute. How you give back. How you celebrate and contribute. So you go from 0 to 10 and you rank these out. You\u2019ll see my wheel doesn\u2019t actually look like a wheel. It\u2019s kind of lopsided, but that\u2019s by design. By the time you look at this, it gives you a clear view of okay, I really need to step out how I contribute and give back. That allowed me to go really deep in my own personal life and say, what does it mean to contribute and give back for me? You and I have both done things in terms of going out. Like charity: water, the Tony Hawk Foundation, and giving away money, but just supporting a cause and writing a check, I\u00a0 don\u2019t know how you feel about this, but for me, it doesn\u2019t really mean that I\u2019m giving back. I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m contributing. Yes, I\u2019m giving cash, but I\u2019m not actually taking part in that process. I\u2019m not actually really helping out. Anyone can write a check. What does it mean for me to contribute? The realization that I came to and actually there\u2019s some really powerful moments in this conference where they turn out the lights and they make you revisit certain times in your childhood and all these things. I felt myself kind of tearing up because one of the things I realized is that I was not giving back and contributing in a meaningful way. The thing that I came to and that I realized is that my mother was verbally abused by my father for many, many, many years. Definitely abusive behavior. Never physically harmed her, but I would say the mental hard is more bad, if not worse, than some of the physical harm. I realized that I want to actually lean in and help out women that have been abused and that are currently in abusive relationships. A goal of mine over the next couple years is finding the best possible way to contribute back to that. Not just in forms of another check, but actually how I can get involved. And whether that means helping them build their products and build a better website or mobile apps or any way that I can enable and use my technology skills to help with their business would be something that would mean a lot to me. So, that was a great experience to have. I wouldn\u2019t have that if it wasn\u2019t for Tony. That was just one of many things that I got out of the weekend. I would say that he\u2019s a badass. It was pretty awesome. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s a real master of his craft. What I would say to folks who have a certain image of Tony is that when you go to an event like this, I think the right way to approach it is to be skeptical but not cynical, and open to trying all of the exercises he suggests. There are going to be components that may not agree with you in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of jumping around. There\u2019s a lot of music. There\u2019s a lot of noise, for lack of a better word. A lot of those elements made me uncomfortable. They\u2019re not things that I would seek out. Kevin Rose: Oh, my God. I could not see you dancing and jumping around. Tim Ferriss: Right? It\u2019s just not my thing. But the filter that I used going into it or the lens through which I was looking at it was it was made easier because one of my very close friends I\u2019ve known since college, who\u2019s had multiple company exits, is extremely, extremely accomplished, and he goes to Unleash the Power Within every year as a reset. He\u2019s been 11 times, maybe 12 now. He\u2019s been to Date with Destiny six times. This guy is not a seminar junkie. He\u2019s not someone who avoids the work and goes to listen to a motivational speech so that he can feel better on a sugar high for two days and not take any next steps. This is not that guy. He is an operator. So, the fact that he had been so many times really led me to want to stick with the entire event. I\u2019m not going to lie. I had hard points. Then I mentioned this to you and it may not be the exercise that had a large impact on you, but the Dickens process that I ended up with Tony including in Tools of Titans, one of my more recent books, because it had such a big impact, made the entire event an easy like 10 to 100 turn for me. Kevin Rose: Mm-hmm, that was the last day, too. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. So, just that 30 to 60-minute exercise led me to dramatically improve my relationship with my father, to take responsibility for certain things that I had been telling myself were unchangeable, to really buckle down and step into discomfort to make some meaningful changes. Those are changes \u2013 Unleash the Power Within, I want to say I went to, now it\u2019s got to be three to five years ago \u2013 those changes, the ripple effects of those changes that I made then are still very tangible now. Then Date with Destiny, very similar. But to go into it expecting that if you step into it and accept some level of discomfort and commit to trying everything, this is just my view, that at least 50 percent you\u2019re going to end up discarding. Probably 20 percent you\u2019re going to find really uncomfortable and you\u2019re going to dislike actively. Then like 10 to 25 percent you\u2019re going to go, holy shit, I can\u2019t believe how powerful that just was. It\u2019s not a lot of handwavy, woo-woo ambiguity. These exercises are really, really, really specific. So, you don\u2019t have to accept Tony as your one and only savior. You don\u2019t have to believe that he is flawless because he is not. He\u2019s just like everyone else. He\u2019s an imperfect creature trying to do the best with the gifts and talents he\u2019s developed. But the guy knows his shit. He actually really cares. As I\u2019ve gotten to know him over the last few years more and more so, I\u2019ve become more impressed with him, not less impressed. That is at least, if one were thinking of attending one of these events, and I have zero vested interest in sending anyone to these events, other than they\u2019ve had a material impact on my life. That\u2019s why I was happy to see that you were going to attend. That they\u2019d go in with an open mind expecting that, much like if you\u2019ve read any type of book, you\u2019re not expecting every line to be a life-changing piece of gold. You\u2019re hoping that net-net it\u2019s going to be worth the time that you invested. That\u2019s been my takeaway. That it\u2019s absolutely been worth the time invested. Kevin Rose: Yeah, 100 percent agree. I think that like you, going into this was certainly a really uncomfortable thing for me in terms of when they first start the music and people come out on stage and they start dancing. You can tell the people that have been there before, because they immediately like jump out of their seats and start rocking out and throwing their hands in the air. I\u2019m thinking to myself, I hate dancing. I hate dancing. I\u2019ve never liked dancing with anyone. My wife or anyone. I always feel so awkward when I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m a geek that likes to sit in front of my computer at night. Then I thought something another friend had told me who had gone and said, \u201cHey, Kevin. You just have to go with it. If you want to get anything out of it, you have to realize that he\u2019s doing this by design to put you into a certain state.\u201d He wants to get you into an optimal state and an optimal \u2013 that can mean like, one example of one thing we did is we took something that was very serious to us, like a limiting belief that you had held so seriously and you say it out loud in a very joking and laughing way, and everybody, like 12,000 people are all doing this at the same time. You\u2019re laughing and saying it. It\u2019s like breaking it down in your mind and letting you know that you don\u2019t have to take it so seriously and you can joke about it and have fun with it because it\u2019s been forever since you\u2019ve probably ever done that in your life. When was the last time you were able to take something that you held so seriously and so guarded and have a good time with it? So, he knows how to set up these little traps for you that trick you into reframing things in your mind. It really does change your long-term perspective on things. Dude, I\u2019m a fan. I would definitely go back again. I did the three-day event, the Unleash the Power Within, the same one as you. But yeah, I had fun with it. So, thanks for helping out with that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, man. My pleasure. I would suggest also that as a point of social proof, and, of course, Tony\u2019s fully aware of the sort of gravitas this would bring, but there are people, for instance, Mark Benioff of Salesforce, which I think has more than $10 billion in annual revenue now, who will pointblank say that Salesforce would probably not exist were it not for Tony Robbins. And he still attends some of these events. He was right behind me at Date with Destiny. He\u2019s a big guy. He and Tony are very similar in size. Then you have Paul Tudor Jones. You have some of the most sophisticated traders and financial minds who have worked with Tony for 10 to 20 years. That\u2019s on an ongoing coaching basis because he does have very discrete, very tactical exercises and tools that help to find blind spots and fully leverage the things that you\u2019re good at and so on. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not comfortable, but certainly I\u2019ve been very benefitted by the time that I\u2019ve spent considering these things. I\u2019m biased because in high school, I read Unlimited Power by Tony, which had an impact. I then, when I got out of college and I had my first job and I was commuting in my piece of shit minivan, the green machine, which was just a complete disaster of a car but I was trapped on 101 in the Bay Area, for people who know, just bumper-to-bumper in rush hour, to and from Mountain View to San Jose to work, and I would listen to this used set. I couldn\u2019t afford the full set, a new copy, so I had Personal Power 2 in cassette tape, and listened to that, which helped me get to the point where I started my first company. Tony\u2019s made these appearances at very opportune moments in my life. Like I said, I don\u2019t go to him for all things. I don\u2019t think Tony has the answer to everything. But with particular types of self-imposed narratives and handicaps that you have built you\u2019re or walls around certain types of thinking or certain types of emotions that perhaps served you very well in the past but no longer serve you, he is exceptionally good and helping you work through all of that. Kevin Rose: I just love that this whole genre, the self-help genre, is not as frowned upon as it used to be. I don\u2019t know if you remember, but probably 10, 15, 20 years ago, if you went to that area of the bookstore, you were like, look it, who\u2019s in the self-help section? There must be something wrong with them. Seriously. That used to be the case. Now it\u2019s gone and he\u2019s probably at the center of it. But it\u2019s become this idea of not self-help, it\u2019s really just this idea that we\u2019re all on a journey of lifelong learning and we all are done BSing ourselves and there\u2019s not a single person that has all of life figured out, so why don\u2019t we all actively, openly work on this together? I think it\u2019s awesome. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I should also say that as one point, as an example, I was interviewed on the BBC. They wanted to talk about the self-help genre. I knew it was going to be setup, right? I knew that they wanted me to defend self-help and they wanted to attack self-help. I knew when I was going in that this is what it was going to be. Or I figured it out about an hour beforehand when I got some notes and I was like, \u201cOh, I see where this is going.\u201d They bring me out \u2013 this is a television show \u2013 and they say, \u201cGood evening, Mr. Ferriss. We just wanted to talk about,\u201d dah-dah-dah, bio, blah, blah, blah, \u201cwhat is your general opinion of the self-help genre?\u201d or something along those lines. In effect, I said, \u201cI think 99.9% of it is just horseshit.\u201d I said, \u201cIt pains me sometimes to be associated with the label \u2018self-help\u2019 for X, Y, and Z reasons.\u201d Then they didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on, right? Because I\u2019d taken their side of the argument, which was kind of hilarious. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s funny. Tim Ferriss: Then I said, \u201cBut, at the same time, I think the label \u2018self-help\u2019 has in many cases an unfairly negative connotation because if you look at almost any type of reading, whether it\u2019s a novel where people want to escape, or it\u2019s nonfiction, where they\u2019re hoping to learn more about let\u2019s call it Andrew Carnegie, or you name the figure, there is some motive behind that, which they hope to help them.\u201d Whether it\u2019s a shift of emotion, the gathering of knowledge so they can impress people at a dinner party or otherwise. And that if I were to look at who I would say potentially emulate in the world of self-help, it would probably be like, and this is a name you brought up earlier, Ben Franklin. Who most certainly wrote extensively about what we consider today to be self-help. But he\u2019s not lumped into the category of potential \u2013 and these people do exist, certainly \u2013 charlatans, who are just selling a bill of goods that doesn\u2019t deliver. There are plenty of people who have not walked the walk and talk extensively about their expertise and make recommendations and prescriptions. There are people all over the world in every possible disciple who do this and a lot of them tend to concentrate in this section of the bookstore called \u2018self-help,\u2019 unfortunately. But that alone isn\u2019t enough to disqualify something. Certainly, if we look at the popularity of tutorials on YouTube, for instance, in any possible subject matter. If you look at the popularity of the Creative Lives and the Courseras and so on. Everyone now has access to expertise that even 10 years ago would\u2019ve cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to access, if they had the ability at all. You look at Harvard, MIT, Stanford. Many of these schools are putting their courses online, in some cases, for free access. I know people who have taught themselves to code in this way. All of that is self-help, right? It\u2019s important, I think, that people not disqualify exploring certain realms because of a label that really represents a concept which may or may not apply to what it is you\u2019re examining. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I mean, there\u2019s going to be scammers in every genre, too. I love how Joe Rogan, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the posts that he\u2019s done recently, but he does video of these martial arts? Tim Ferriss: The legit as fuck? Yeah. That\u2019s his caption. Kevin Rose: Where they can throw people with their mind? Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Joe Rogan puts up these fake martial arts videos. I mean, they\u2019re not fake. They\u2019re videos of people who actually believe that what\u2019s happening is happening. But these self-described martial arts masters throwing people across the room with their Qi explosions and so on. His caption is usually, \u201clegit as fuck.\u201d Or #legitasfuck. Kevin Rose: It\u2019s so good. It\u2019s so good. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of nonsense out there, but it doesn\u2019t mean that everything within a certain category is nonsense. It doesn\u2019t mean you should spend your entire life filtering for the one percent. But also, there are ways that you can assess the validity of different paths. Quite frankly, I would recommend for those people who haven\u2019t \u2013 well, I\u2019ll give you two recommendations. One is you can look at the back of The 4-Hour Body, if you already have it, there\u2019s an appendix which is effectively how to spot bad science. It will help you to not trick yourself and also to get better at avoiding being tricked. So, that\u2019s one recommendation. Not to seem like I\u2019m selling my own book, the excerpts for that appendix are from a book called Bad Science by a doctor named Ben Goldacre, which is absolutely fantastic. So, if you just want to be scientifically literate or better able to separate the signal from the noise with the deluge of information that we are assaulted by every day, I would highly recommend that you check out one or both of those resources. Kevin Rose: I was going to ask you, Tools of Titans, obviously in your books there have been tons of book recommendations. There was that one kid, do you remember the kid, that took all and he created, he took all the books out of your recommendations and ranked them? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he ranked them or just organized them as thumbnails. Yeah, I do remember that. Kevin Rose: The idea was that what is the most recommended book inside Tools of Titans across the board by all the people that were in that book? Kind of stack-ranking them based on the votes. Do you have that list anywhere? Do you have a list of like the most recommended books by all of your guests? Tim Ferriss: I do, actually. I\u2019ll pull it up right now because I put it on the blog for everybody. Kevin Rose: That\u2019s a great way to cut through all the crap, you know? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I put it up on the blog. If you give me a second, I will find where it is. This might take a second. I\u2019m looking at Tribe of Mentors, the most recent. Where would I find this? If you go onto tim.blog and search Tools of Titans books. Kevin Rose: We can put a link in the show notes, right? Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ll put a link in the show notes. This will be the smarter way to do it. If you want to see a page where the most commonly recommended books from Tools of  Titans and from Tribe of Mentors, combined, you\u2019re looking at about 500 different world-class performers of all different disciplines, ranging from top professional athletes to chess prodigies, to former Generals, certainly 12+ billionaires, then you will get to see rank ordered in terms of frequency which books are most recommended. I will put those in the show notes and you guys can find that at tim.blog/podcast. If you want to see of these people who are the best at what they do, which books across disciplines do they recommend most often. A few of them, just off the bat for people who are curious: Man\u2019s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl; Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanac by Charlie Munger; Seeking Wisdom by Peter Bevelin; and certainly Atlas Shrugged, even though it\u2019s a controversial book, by Ayn Rand, comes up a lot in terms of developing a sense of personal agency. I think that has popped up quite a lot. And many more. But I\u2019ll give you the full list because there are some that pop up quite frequently that you won\u2019t recognize at all. Those are, to me, oftentimes the really fun ones to explore. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Yeah, I\u2019ve got a bunch of Audible credits waiting to be spent. So, I\u2019ll do that. Tim Ferriss: Awesome, man. Well, I think this is a solid catch-up. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Thanks for having me on. It was fun to chat. Tim Ferriss: Where can people learn more about Kevin Rose, find you on the interwebs? Kevin Rose: Certainly. My podcast is available at kevinrose.com. Then also if you want to check out my free meditation app, it\u2019s 100 percent free, a little bit more traditional meditation. It\u2019s called Oak and you can do that at oakmeditation.com. Tim Ferriss: Nice and succinct. No social? Kevin Rose: Yeah, you know, Twitter @kevinrose. But I don\u2019t know that I use it that much anymore. I\u2019m more a newsletter guy. If you go to my website, you can sign up for my newsletter. I do a once-a-month newsletter. That\u2019s kind of what I use. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a good newsletter. I subscribe to it, which I can\u2019t say for many. Yeah, Twitter has turned into a bit of a nasty neighborhood on most days. You just feel like you\u2019re minding your business, whistling, walking down the street, then you have people throwing potted plants at your head. Kevin Rose: And then Facebook is a whole shit show. So, it\u2019s like, that\u2019s the worst kind of show. Tim Ferriss: What to do? Go back to the tried and true. Kevin Rose: Instagram. Tim Ferriss: Instagram or email. All right, my man. Well, thanks so much for taking the time. I hope to see you soon. Come visit Austin. Got a barrel sauna waiting for you. Kevin Rose: I will. Awesome. See ya. Tim Ferriss: See ya. To everyone listening or watching on the YouTubes, you can find links to everything that we\u2019ve talked about in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast. Until next time, be safe, do not take meth for fun, follow professional advice with anything medically related, and live the examined life. Just because it is self-help doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t help you. I\u2019ll leave with that.

a lot of fun doing stupid shit together", "but speaking of, well, probably not that dumb these days, but fasting", "so, i got into fasting here probably about three years ago, two and a half to three years ago", "i started fasting app zero, which is a free fasting tracker", "that has really kind of blown up and taken off", "but then i started hearing about the research from dr", "valter longo", "it actually was from a friend of mine, you know mike mazur, a mutual friend of ours", "yup", "mike was diagnosed with stage iv cancer", "he went into chemotherapy treatment and he was one of the guys that said, i\u2019m not going to just take what they give me, but i\u2019m going to go out and do my own research and see what else i can be doing to help fight this and beat this down", "one of the things that came up was this idea of doing these 5-day fmds", "fmd stays for fasting mimicking diet", "the idea is that compliance of doing a standard 5-day fast is relatively low", "it\u2019s am extremely difficult thing to do", "tim, have you ever done a 5-day water-only fast", "have you tried", "yeah, i\u2019ve done 5, 7, and 10-day", "i\u2019ve done a 5-day water-only, and i will tell you, it is absolutely brutal", "i don\u2019t know what your experience was, but i had a really difficult time sleeping", "yeah, there\u2019s a, i believe it\u2019s a cholinergic effect that leads you have rapid heartbeat quite often, when you\u2019re trying to sleep", "it\u2019s not pleasant", "so, you\u2019ll be exhausted and you\u2019ll lay down in bed and you\u2019ll feel like you just ran a 100-meter sprint in terms of heartbeat", "it\u2019s very unpleasant", "it\u2019s kind of scary", "i\u2019m also one of those people that get those early heartbeats, where you feel like your heart skips a beat", "they\u2019re completely benign", "i\u2019ve had it looked at it and everything\u2019s fine, but i get those every once in a while and those come more frequently when i\u2019m in a fasted state", "so, long story short, mike does this 5-day fast", "he beats back cancer", "he\u2019s in full remission, which is awesome", "but the idea with the 5-day fast \u2013 can i interrupt you one more time", "i think this, i don\u2019t think mike would mind this, but i remember you and i when we were talking about this \u2013 did he do 5 or 3", "i can\u2019t recall", "i\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right", "he did 3", "he did 3", "just for those who are curious, i\u2019ve had conversations with dominic d\u2019agostino before on this podcast", "he\u2019s a very well-published researcher", "i was first introduced to the possibility that fasting prior to chemotherapy, i believe, and reduction, it could be either, has the potential to increase the resilience of normal cells while increasing the susceptibility or weakness of cancer cells to facilitate this type of treatment, but also to decrease the side effect that are commonly experienced", "so, mike, t my understanding, would do a 3-day fast before a session and while the other people in his cohort were laid out on the couch or in bed the next day, he\u2019d be running a 10-mile training run", "right, which is just insane", "which is nuts", "yeah, and so he originally when he got turned on to this research by dr", "longo, he showed me this youtube video where they were giving rats chemotherapy", "the rats that were fasted were just running around the cage", "they looked like normal, healthy rats", "the ones that didn\u2019t fast were just, like you said, on their side, all beat up and in a horrible state", "that\u2019s exactly what mike experienced", "the idea is that making the chemotherapy more effective is that you\u2019re depriving the cancer cells of some nutrients, certainly sugar, less glucose, and it makes them more susceptible to the chemotherapy treatments, so the chemotherapy is that much more effective", "obviously, we can\u2019t say for certain whether that\u2019s what put him into remission, but he\u2019s really happy that it did work", "he is in remission and the evidence looks pretty compelling in humans", "they\u2019re also extending this whole protocol to healthy individuals as a way to potentially prevent cancer from even forming in the first place", "i was turned onto dr", "valter longo\u2019s new book, the longevity diet", "i had him on my podcast", "have you see this book yet", "i have seen that", "i haven\u2019t read it, but i have seen it", "it\u2019s pretty awesome", "there\u2019s a whole chapter on his fmd protocol and what you need to do these 5-day fasts, getting into what it actually is", "how it differs from a water-only fast is that you do have calories", "so, you have around 700 calories or so per day", "some people say that sounds like a lot", "some people say it sounds like a little", "it\u2019s actually not much food", "it\u2019s like a handful of small soup and some crackers", "the first day, it\u2019s so not bad", "you\u2019re like, oh, i can do this", "like, some crackers and a little bit of soup", "then day two and day three, and you\u2019re like, oh, my god, i\u2019m dying, right", "but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as water-only", "but the idea is that you eat just enough good to still get into this fasted state", "so, all of your inflammation markers, all of the different markers that they\u2019re looking at in your blood, they look just like you\u2019re doing a water-only fast, but with a minimal amount of food", "so, you have a little bit of, not as much hunger, and a little bit more energy", "and so the compliance is much higher", "were you tracking \u2013 when you do these fmds, have you tracked your ketone levels at all", "do you get into ketosis or does the small amount of carbohydrate and so on that you\u2019re consuming keep you out of ketosis", "i get a mild, i would say i get around .5 or so millimolars, so it\u2019s a very mild \u2013 that\u2019s right on the edge", "right, which is kind of brutal because you\u2019re kind of in the keto flu-symptom area", "so, you\u2019re not fully into ketosis", "this is really interesting because peter attia, who you\u2019ve had on the show a few times, he\u2019s my doctor and i know you work with him as well", "we played around with this protocol in that attia has put together an fmd diet that is a lot more ketogenic friendly", "so, a lot heavier on the fats and a lot less on the refined carbohydrates", "so, for example, when you\u2019re doing longo\u2019s version of this diet, and he actually has a nonprofit called prolon, so you\u2019d actually just order this kit", "so, i get a kit in the mail that has all the pre-packaged food", "if you\u2019re watching the video version of this, this is what it looks like here", "i just happen to have one", "this is day 5", "what does the nonprofit do with the money they get", "because it looks very \u2013 it goes back into research", "it goes back into research", "that\u2019s right", "longo doesn\u2019t receive any of the money at all", "he doesn\u2019t take a salary", "this is meant for people that want to create a little autophagy, a little cell death, generate new stem cells, which he has proven actually happens via this 5-day method", "the thing that hooked me though is i have had an elevated cholesterol on my whole father\u2019s side of the family", "that\u2019s turned into heart disease with my dad and him passing away from a heart attack", "my grandpa passed away from a heart attack", "my grandma on my dad\u2019s side passed away from a heart attack", "so, it\u2019s running deep", "it\u2019s a little bit scary", "now that i\u2019m 40, i\u2019ve got these pretty bad numbers", "so much so that attia has put me on crestor, which is knocking back the bad cholesterol with the statin, but obviously i\u2019d prefer not to be on a statin", "anyway, long story short, because of his book, the longevity diet, i was reading through it and he said that he was seeing people that did the 5-day fast, they were improving their cholesterol numbers and they were getting more good cholesterol and less bad cholesterol", "i was like, oh, that sounds interesting, i might as well give this a shot", "but to give it a proper shot, you\u2019re supposed to do \u2013 and i talked to longo about this \u2013 but three back-to-back 5-day fasts over three months, and then once a quarter", "so, there\u2019s like a loading phase of fasting, where you do whatever, the first week of each month for three months and then \u2013 it\u2019s the creatine of fasting", "right, and then you do maintenance once a quarter thereafter", "that\u2019s right", "okay", "yeah, so i did the first 5-day fast three months ago", "i had my bloodwork drawn pre and post", "small minor improvements", "second fast, same thing", "then by the third, we actually saw a dramatic drop on a few different fronts cholesterol-wise", "attia, when he called me up, because we do these little calls to go over my bloodwork, he was like, \u201ckevin, you\u2019re going to live to 90 if you can keep this up", "this is amazing.\u201d he was shocked", "he was blown away", "we\u2019re pretty happy with the results", "we\u2019ll see how long they stick", "this is no dietary changes", "granted, there\u2019s a dietary change during those five days, but no long-term", "i\u2019m still kind of sticking to the same diet that i\u2019ve always been sticking to", "i like that he was so specific with 90", "that\u2019s lower than i would\u2019ve expected, so it must be all the meth that you\u2019re doing that\u2019s going to kill you", "yeah, i still do a dose of meth every now and then", "actually, speaking of meth, dude, i just did some l-theanine for the first time today", "have you tried this with coffee", "it is very interesting stuff, to be sure", "oh, my god, dude", "i\u2019d never tried it before", "i took a pill, 200 milligrams this morning, and i was out with a mutual friend, tony conrad", "we met for coffee and i gave him a pill too", "we were like cracked out for like three hours, man", "yeah, so this observing of the biohacking is a mutual arrangement that kevin and i have", "it\u2019s not just him watching squirting fluid out of my elbow", "i also observe things that you do", "on the fmd though, just to return to that for a second, you mentioned in passing that attia had looked at the possibility of doing a lower-carbohydrate, higher-fat version", "he actually has a protocol for that, yeah", "i\u2019m sure he\u2019d give you the pdf if you ask for it for the podcast notes", "have you tried it", "i did", "i did that for the second one", "i liked it, actually i just happened to buy a 3-pack of the prolon kit, so i wanted to go through them and use because they\u2019re not cheap and so i just used that for the last one", "but i like attia\u2019s in that it\u2019s a little bit more work, obviously, because you\u2019re preparing your own food, but his is different in that with prolon you get these little, tiny snacks throughout the entire day", "with his, it\u2019s one meal a day and it\u2019s just a salad", "it\u2019s greens and three tablespoons or four tablespoons of olive oil and like six olives and some sunflower seeds", "it\u2019s not a whole lot, but it certainly gives you \u2013 but it\u2019s not as refined", "so, i saw my ketone levels go up on his", "i certainly had more energy on his versus the prolon", "got it", "i\u2019ll ping peter about that", "it makes sense on multiple levels that you would have higher ketone levels", "for people who are wondering how one would measure ketone levels, i think you and i still use the same device, which is the precision xtra by abbott labs, which does a sufficient job in measuring something called bhb, beta hydroxybutyrate in the blood", "for a number of different reasons, this is a much more precise and accurate, let\u2019s just call is precise, but consistently precise \u2014 maybe it\u2019s accurate, maybe it isn\u2019t \u2013 method of measuring ketones or the degree to which you\u2019re in ketosis than pee sticks", "because as your body becomes, or if you\u2019re already very efficient at using ketone bodies, you could show a false negative", "where you pee on the stick and it tells you you\u2019re not in ketosis, when in fact you are", "so, the blood is just more accurate", "i\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to live 90", "that makes me happy", "yeah, it was a pretty cool experiment and certainly for someone who has heart disease running in their family, i\u2019m going to keep it up", "i\u2019m going to do another blood draw here next week to see where my levels are at and then i\u2019m trying to do this quarterly", "hopefully, if we can get it down to where i won\u2019t be using statins any longer, that\u2019d be great", "the last time we did a random show, it was a very, very long time ago, i believe", "i was at least before you had a little monkey in your house", "a reason, many reasons, of course, to stick around, but now a very compelling new reason", "so, how would you describe \u2013 since certainly i have no kids that i\u2019m aware of at this point \u2013 that\u2019s a good disclaimer there", "i don\u2019t have kids \u2013 *that i know of", "what have been the biggest changes that you\u2019ve felt or observed in yourself or otherwise", "how you view the world", "anything like that now that you have a kid", "and what is your kid\u2019s name", "zelda", "she\u2019s four months old", "she\u2019s named after the video game because one of the first things that my wife and i bonded on very early in our relationship was our love for the game zelda", "actually, the new zelda game allows you to track your hours played", "it actually shows it in the little settings menu", "darya has over 200 hours played of the latest zelda", "she\u2019s hardcore", "she played a lot during her pregnancy", "she\u2019s a true believer", "and when we were in japan a long time ago, darya was using some time of emulator, i don\u2019t know what device it was on exactly, but she was playing zelda on all the trains when we were sitting down and chilling", "that\u2019s one thing i remember", "the original", "yeah, josh cook was too", "that\u2019s right", "it\u2019s fun to play the original ones with those old-school emulators", "but yeah, in terms of her, it\u2019s hard for, i think, a guy in that when you have your first child, there\u2019s not a whole lot to do", "there\u2019s just a lot of crying", "i tried to help out where i can but rly she was on her mom\u2019s hip for the first several weeks and there\u2019s a lot of getting used to new things", "now, it\u2019s just amazing, dude", "you walk into a room and she lights up when she sees me for the first time", "she smiles and giggles", "it kind of changes the way that i want to approach life in terms of what things are important and trying to make more time to be a good father", "for someone like myself that has so many varying interests and certainly can get sucked into new things pretty easily, i\u2019ve been trying to be a little bit more thoughtful about where and when i spend my energy so that i can kind of dial back", "i\u2019ve spent a good portion of this year trying to live a little bit more of a minimalist lifestyle", "what are some of the steps that you\u2019ve taken to do that", "i feel like you and i have had this conversation every year since we first met", "but now, you actually have a gigantic incentive to follow through", "well, it\u2019s funny", "every time tim and i get together, it\u2019s like oh, man", "i\u2019ve got too many investments", "i\u2019m doing this", "there\u2019s too many things going on", "i\u2019ve got to spend my time here", "we\u2019re always more or less complaining to each other of us taking on too many things", "it\u2019s so ridiculous", "so, i\u2019ve just been trying to implement a few rules", "one of the things i did starting january 1st was to throw away or donate something every single day", "so, i have forced myself to go in and \u2013 for example, i went in and i just picked out all the clothes that i haven\u2019t touched in a year and i took them down the street, like half a block away is a donation place, and i donated anything that i hadn\u2019t worn in a year", "it really thins out your closet", "was that easy for you to do", "yes, absolutely", "it was", "there was no resistance", "you weren\u2019t like, \u201cbut that\u2019s the sweater that my auntie janie gave me.\u201d who\u2019s the lady you had on your podcast that wrote that book", "marie kondo", "technically, marie kondo is how they would say it in japanese, but marie kondo", "marie kondo", "yeah, she\u2019s awesome", "i listed to her audiobook and one of the things that she says in her audiobook is that \u201cthe way that you can depart with something is to realize that it has already taught you its lesson", "that lesson may be that it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d if you have it hanging in your closet and you look at it and you\u2019re like, \u201coh, but someday i might\u2026.\u201d no, the lesson is that it spent its time with you, it wasn\u2019t for you, and it should go to\u00a0 good home where it can be appreciated by someone else", "my lesson is not to buy it again", "i took that and i\u2019ve applied that to thinning out pretty much everything in my life", "i think a lot of people, there\u2019s this analysis paralysis thing where you think about cleaning out the garage or you\u2019re thinking about doing this massive overhaul in your life and you\u2019re like, it\u2019s the weekend, i\u2019ve got to do this", "there\u2019s always something that jumps in front of it in terms of priorities", "for me, i find that if i just say, okay, one thing a day", "at the end of year, i may not be to my goal, but after five years, i certainly will", "it\u2019s not like i have that much stuff", "but really saying, do i need this in my life", "is it bringing joy to my life", "it\u2019s such a good forcing function to get rid of a lot of stuff", "everything you get rid of is actually less of a mental load on you", "there was this old tea master that i met one time", "tim and i have done some crazy travels all throughout china in tea lands", "oh, the stories we could tell", "seriously", "we\u2019ve done some crazy stuff in the middle of the yunnan province", "nothing sexual", "that was our friend", "we had a friend that did something", "so, long story short, the one thing that this tea master showed me was he pulled out of his pocket one key", "he showed me the one key", "he goes, \u201ckevin, do you know what this is?\u201d i was like, \u201cit\u2019s a key.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, it\u2019s the key to my house", "this is my one key", "i\u2019ve worked my entire life to have one key.\u201d because we can all have multiple keys", "meaning the things that you purchase", "whether you have a key to your boat or your spare garage or a motorcycle or whatever it may be", "there\u2019s things in your life that you accumulate and the least amount of burden and the most happiness you can get is having less stuff to worry about", "and so i find that to be really true", "that\u2019s what i\u2019ve been trying to focus on is having less and being happy with a handful of high-quality things", "i also want to mention that it\u2019s possible to read a book like marie kondo\u2019s book, which i can never remember the title of it", "i want to say the magic art of japanese tidying up, but no, it\u2019s something close", "it\u2019s like the art of, the joy of magic cleaning up", "i can never remember the exact phrasing", "i don\u2019t know why", "but in any case, that cult following with her book leads some readers to think it\u2019s an all-or-nothing, take-it-or-leave-it approach", "you, on the other hand, have philosophically found bits and pieces of that book that are very useful to you but are tactically doing the opposite of what she recommends, but it works for you", "so, she recommends doing this once-in-a-lifetime tidying super bowl, basically, where you block out two or three days of your life and that\u2019s what you do and then the rest is maintenance", "it\u2019s kind of like the fast mimicking diet of japanese tidying", "you have this loading phase", "i\u2019ve had this book \u2013 i actually am looking at it on my bookshelf right now \u2013 for like two years", "i\u2019m just like, \u201cman, i\u2019m going to do it", "i\u2019m going to do it.\u201d then i\u2019m like, two to three days", "i look at my calendar and i\u2019m like, \u201cno, i\u2019m not going to do it", "i\u2019m just not going to do it.\u201d i like the idea tactically of one at a time", "one per day", "also, what\u2019s helped me, because i have actually been, since i moved to austin not too long ago, it\u2019s been a great opportunity after boxing everything up", "okay, do i really want to box all this stuff or do i just want to donate a lot of this because it might be from a 1 to 10 scale of value a 2 to me, or maybe a 1, maybe a 3", "but i could donate this very to goodwill or somewhere else to say a high school gym that needs equipment, which is something i\u2019ve done in the past, and it\u2019s an immediate 8, 9, or 10", "it\u2019s a nice karmic chess move to donate", "you think of not what you\u2019re losing, but also what you\u2019re giving to someone else in that respect, which i find really helpful", "so you\u2019re giving away one item per day", "the other thing, too, i will tell you along those lines is that if there is a purchase that i want to make that is not just what i would consider to be a necessity like toilet paper or whatever it may be, and it\u2019s something that is luxury, not luxury but in the sense of it\u2019s going to cost you over $100, and i don\u2019t necessarily need it, but i kind of want to try it, what i do is i save for later on amazon", "so you can add and say save for later", "set a reminder in your calendar app for a week or two weeks later", "almost 90 percent of the time i end up not buying that thing", "i still have one thing in there actually from you", "it\u2019s that nac supplement", "should i buy that", "i haven\u2019t bought it yet", "well, nac, i should say with all of this stuff that we\u2019re discussing because it bears repeating", "we are not doctors; we don\u2019t play them on the internet", "everybody should assume that at least 50 percent of what we\u2019re saying is complete fucking nonsense and we are just not sure which 50 percent it is", "so, work with a qualified professional before you start taking or stopping any type of medication or supplement", "the nac came to me initially because i was looking at it as a means to accelerate recovery between workouts", "my understanding \u2013 i might be getting this wrong \u2013 but is that it is a precursor to glutathione, which some people think of as this master antioxidant or upstream antioxidant that a host of beneficial effects", "what i noticed in taking the nac is that i was over the period of a week to 10 days, perhaps seven, eight days into it, that i was more even-keeled than was typical", "like the week had been very smooth", "i hadn\u2019t change anything else that i could identify", "i\u2019d been either meditating or not meditating for a series of weeks", "there were a lot of constants", "when i went onto pubmed and began to look at n-acetyl cysteine and search for other terms, like \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201cbipolar,\u201d and so on, there were a number of search results that popped up that seemed to indicate to me that there was some promise in using nac to mitigate the amplitude of the ups and downs that could be associated with bipolar", "that\u2019s the primary reason that, for period of time, and i cycle off of all of these things", "i became very fascinated by nac, which quite nicely does have potentially recovery benefits from an athletic standpoint, although most of my athletic prowess has been focused on eating oatmeal cookies recently, so i can\u2019t really claim that i\u2019m doing a lot of killer workouts", "i got rhabdo from eating oatmeal cookies", "for you crossfitters out there, that\u2019s for you", "the other would be something you and i are both familiar with, which is low-dose lithium orotate, very, very low-dose lithium orotate, 5 mgs, which you can find on amazon and elsewhere", "there\u2019s a great new york times article which people can find very easily that is titled along the lines of \u201cmaybe we all just need a little bit of lithium.\u201d it talks about the inverse correlation of groundwater concentrations of lithium with, i want to say at least reported, suicide, homicide, manic depression, and so on", "those two, for me, function in tandem or at least appeal to me for very similar reasons", "so, the nac, should you use it or not, i think is a question of whether you feel you need it", "for me, at least currently, i get asked all the time, what are your top 10 supplements that you\u2019re using right now", "because people have this impression after reading the 4-hour body and so on that i walk around with a drip iv bag in my arm and have a thousand pills i\u2019m taking four times a day", "well, i\u2019ve certainly seen you in that mode", "you have seen me in that mode, but my mode right now is to really ensure that i am using supplements as supplements", "that i\u2019m not using them to absolve me of the responsibility to eat proper food, for instance", "it\u2019s like look, if you\u2019re drinking a lot and you\u2019re like compulsively watching porn and not exercising and mainlining pixie sticks for your diet and you\u2019re like, \u201cwow, i\u2019m depressed", "maybe i should take 15 different supplements.\u201d it\u2019s like no, you need to fucking fix the rest of your life and then see what your baseline is because you\u2019re creating so much static and noise and garbage inputs that you don\u2019t even know what your baseline is", "it\u2019s so disguised with sort of the trauma and confusion of your inputs", "do you track your baseline", "do you log what you consume and what you take", "this is going to sound so primitive and it is, but my baseline is really how do i feel when i wake up", "do i want to stay in bed because i don\u2019t want to face the day", "am i anxious", "are those my first thoughts coming out of bed", "assuming that i\u2019m not checking my phone, right", "because it\u2019s really my starting state out of the gate of sleep to wakefulness", "then at night, how much trouble do i have sleeping", "if any", "or do i fall asleep easily", "how deep is my sleep", "so for deepness of sleep, you could certainly use something like an aura ring or an accelerometer", "there are different means by which you could try to assess the quality of your sleep", "but for me, really looking at how consistently i feel good waking up and how long it takes me to get up to say first or second gear", "it historically has taken me a long time to go from park to second or third gear", "some people wake up \u2013 you might be one of these people \u2013 they\u2019re like, \u201cfuck it, world", "here i am", "i\u2019m ready to party!\u201d that\u2019s not me", "i have a real slow build", "i think in between you and that", "i\u2019m definitely not ready to party the second i wake up", "i am after coffee", "i have a cup of coffee, i\u2019m ready to party", "i feel that way, if, for instance, i\u2019m in ketosis, past about 2 millimolars", "i need less sleep", "so, let\u2019s call it six versus eight hours", "and when i take up, i am awake", "versus feeling groggy for an hour or two, hour and a half", "which can be remedied somewhat by the psychological advantage of exercising in the morning, which is one thing i\u2019ve been scheduling to do more of per jocko willink, a retired navy seal commander and all-around intense dude", "badass", "yeah", "intense, accomplished guy", "people can find him at tim.blog/jocko", "jocko\u2019s first-ever public interview", "i\u2019m thrilled to have unleashed the giant, white gorilla on the internet", "baseline though, to return to your question, is really something i try to keep as simple as possible", "do i and have i measured all of those other things", "yes", "but i think that whether it\u2019s with your body or with a business, or any number of other things, it\u2019s really easy to become addicted to measuring things that don\u2019t matter very much", "or worse still, measuring things that will distract you from the things that do matter", "does that make sense", "yeah, that totally makes sense", "i\u2019ve tried to pare it down to just the stuff i really care about", "i just sent you a link in our video chat to my dashboard for the things i measure every day", "so, for me, i\u2019m really concerned about my glucose levels because they are a tiny bit elevated", "so, i do waking glucose, bedtime glucose", "i do whether i meditated that day or not", "i do how many hours i fasted the night prior", "i do how many drinks i\u2019ve had and then i do what type of workout, whether i had tea or coffee that day, and then my food", "but food not in terms of a by-the-calorie, super-anal kind of breakdown, but really just typing out what i ate for that day as a way to hold myself accountable and just look over the last few days at a glance and see if i\u2019ve been behaving or not", "so, i find that just the act of writing it down makes me behave a little bit better", "it does", "okay, that was going to be my question", "how does that actually impact your behavior", "this is a fascinating question", "i did an experiment here about three weeks ago with a group of five friends", "i created this spreadsheet that we all logged into every single day", "what you do is you record the number of drinks you had the night before", "i was thinking about turning this into an app, although i\u2019m not going to do it", "but i was interested in trying to create social pressure to drink less", "not to drink more, but to drink less", "the thing that i found that was really interesting is that if you drink over two drinks in a night, people have some shame in reporting that, so they will mis-report", "if you went out and you had four, five drinks, it\u2019s like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to be the guy who had four drinks.\u201d the one asshole on the spreadsheet", "right, exactly", "so, i changed it then so the spreadsheet would only say 2+", "so that\u2019s the max you could go", "then people were more open to being like, \u201cyeah, i had 2+ last night.\u201d they were a lot more at ease, but it still created a little bit of social pressure and personal pressure if you looked at your list and you\u2019re like, \u201cooh, there\u2019s been four nights of 2+ there", "i should probably do a night without drinking.\u201d so, my idea was to create an app that would allow you just to say up to 2+ and see all of your friends in the same arena and then hopefully encourage you to be able to drink socially but not take it too far", "yeah, this brings up all sorts of really fascinating and frustrated methodological questions in terms of designing this type of reporting, right", "because i was thinking to myself as you were saying this, well, if you had a larger group, say a group of 200 people, one would expect you would have more people in that group reporting drinking 2, 3, 4 drinks on any given night", "so, the shame factor would be decreased, but if you decrease the shame factor, that also decreases the incentive to actually behave, right", "because you can blend into this perceived acceptability of being like well, there are 10 other people out of 200 who had four drinks last night", "that\u2019s totally fine", "well, the question is, how well do you know the people", "so, how tight are they in your social connections in your peer group", "like brenden mulligan \u2013 i\u2019ll call him out because he\u2019s a friend of ours", "he works at google", "he never drinks", "he has like one drink", "one drink", "one drink every four days or whatever", "seeing him hit those streaks of like zero drinks, zero drinks, that was also a pretty powerful thing", "i\u2019m saying i need to be more like brenden", "i need to dial it back", "so, it goes both ways", "that\u2019s true", "i suppose if you\u2019re seeing friends of yours doing well who have demanding jobs, demanding relationships, you can\u2019t use that as your excuse when you have the data right in front of you showing that they\u2019re actually behaving", "so, you historically have been a non-trivial drinker, let\u2019s call it", "like a minor league all-star of booze consumption", "i used to drink a lot more, to be honest", "you can see my spreadsheet here", "so, what has helped you most to decrease the amount that you drink", "well, i think there is fear", "i\u2019ve seen a bunch of studies, there was one that was just published here a couple weeks ago, the largest study ever around dementia and alcohol abuse", "they\u2019ve very closely linked, which is really frightening", "i think wanting to live longer for my daughter is another one, back to the point you had earlier about what has changed", "and just getting older", "hangovers happen at 2.5 drinks these days", "why roll the dice", "for me, to get to your question around what have i done differently, there\u2019s a couple things", "one, i\u2019ve set aside time to learn at night, which i think is really important", "you really can\u2019t drink and learn at the same time", "or remember what you attempt to learn", "exactly", "the second thing that has been huge for me though has been the sauna", "the sauna has been massive because it is like four drinks or three drinks, just by going and doing a 30-minute, high-intense heat sauna session", "you come home and you sleep like a baby", "if you don\u2019t have a sauna, that can also be substituted with a really hot bath", "it\u2019s always been about i\u2019m with my wife, i\u2019m sitting down, and we\u2019re going to crack open a bottle of wine, and i\u2019ll have a couple glasses of wine", "it\u2019s never been like, \u201chey, let\u2019s go party!\u201d those days are long gone", "like a decade-plus gone", "no, don\u2019t look at me like that", "a decade-plus", "listen, if we\u2019re out traveling together, tim, we\u2019re going to have fun, right", "okay", "so, the only times you and i hang is when we\u2019re traveling together, so you can\u2019t put that on me", "all right, fair enough", "we\u2019re in different cities now", "i will say, for those people who are like, wait \u2013 they can see each other", "we are doing a very intimate video chat on skype that you will be able to see on my youtube channel, youtube.com/timferriss", "kevin is dressed for success, i will note", "i just had a park meeting this morning, so we dress up a little bit", "i appreciate it", "so, i gave you that look", "traveling is a bit of an exception", "how do you prevent yourself \u2013 you have traveled a lot", "in some cases, historically", "now, that may change with your daughter, but how do you prevent that from becoming the excuse to drink that happens frequently", "does that make sense", "because this happens in all sorts of capacities, right", "where people will say, \u201coh, you\u2019re traveling, you should eat pizza every night.\u201d i hear that and i\u2019m like if i followed that role, i\u2019d be jabba the hut, because i end up traveling so much", "if i allowed myself that out, it would become a real problem", "yeah, traveling is difficult, especially when it\u2019s in a social setting", "if you combine traveling with social", "i\u2019ll be going to ted in a couple weeks and i know that there\u2019s just going to be a lot of parties and a lot of events and a lot of drinking", "i think that\u2019s one of the things that i need to work on is that i have a hard time dealing with large groups of people that i don\u2019t know", "as a social lubricant, alcohol is amazing, right", "it\u2019s like, what else can we do", "i think that someone was telling me that you never really strengthen that muscle if you\u2019re leaning on the crutch of alcohol", "so, you\u2019re never going to become more comfortable with new humans and new interactions and new ways of breaking the ice if you always just go to the booze, right", "so, i think of it like, this is my workout that i\u2019m going into", "i\u2019ve got a couple little hacks", "one is to show up a little bit late, so then you skip a drink, right", "it\u2019s funny how if you skip a drink or two and you get there and people are already a little hammered, how unattractive and unappealing drinking then becomes", "because you look at everyone\u2019s like, \u201chey, good to see you!\u201d and it\u2019s a little bit sloppy", "you look at that and you\u2019re like, okay, they\u2019re relaxed", "they\u2019re not going to remember what i said anyway, not that they\u2019re that hammered, but you know what i mean", "they\u2019re in their relaxed state", "so, i can be a little bit more jokey and be myself and not have to worry about being hammered", "that\u2019s a big piece of it", "when i\u2019m at home, you\u2019re going to laugh at this, but on amazon, i bought these \u2013 speaking of buying more things that i\u2019m probably going to throw away in a year \u2013 i bought these measuring cups that measure out exactly one glass of wine", "so, what i do there is a bottle of wine we all know is kind of, like a half bottle of wine is kind of two and a half, maybe, it\u2019s up there", "it\u2019s very easy, like darya will have a little bit less than me and i\u2019ll say, okay, i\u2019ll wait until it gets halfway and then i\u2019ll stop, you know", "but you\u2019re actually drinking more than you think", "yeah, plus with a wine glass, if you have a large wine glass, you can think like a third of a bottle or close to half a bottle very easily", "right, exactly", "so, what i do now is i bought this measuring glass off of amazon", "i fill that perfectly, pour it in, get my second glass, fill it perfectly and pour it in", "so, that\u2019s all of my alcohol for the night", "it stops me at two drinks, and i really take my time with it then", "i have dinner", "i slowly sip it", "i look at it", "i go sit down", "we might watch a little john oliver or something and then continue to sip on it", "that\u2019s my way of locking in", "i know no more past that", "it prevents any hangovers", "my doctor says it\u2019s pretty good for you to have a glass or two a night", "then also \u2013 dude, don\u2019t laugh at me", "it is good for you", "ish", "i\u2019ll go with ish", "no, but then it\u2019s also taking nights off altogether", "i think that\u2019s the other big piece of it", "yeah, for sure", "good for you, man", "i love it", "now, you mentioned one other thing", "well, actually a couple of other points because i\u2019ve been also cutting back on alcohol quite a bit", "i still enjoy alcohol", "not gonna lie", "i do have booze on occasion", "i love your drunk \u2013 oh, the drunk dials", "yeah", "those are fun", "for those who don\u2019t know, occasionally, i do these drunk-dial episodes", "it\u2019s the laziest podcast format thought up, i think to date, perhaps, which is i have listeners fill out a google form with their contact info and i set a time, like a two-hour window where i will call people via skype and starting drinking at call 1 and drink all the way through to say call 10 and get progressively more inebriated as i answer questions", "that is fun", "i did one about a week ago", "it was a good time", "then i thought i should do another episode today", "i was like, i just don\u2019t want to do two nights of sipping tequila on skype", "a few things that have also helped me", "no", "1 is, and this is not an excuse everyone is going to be comfortable using, but if i go to a party and they\u2019re like, \u201chey, man", "you\u2019re not drinking", "what the fuck?\u201d i\u2019ll be like, \u201cyeah, i\u2019m on a bunch of weird drugs", "i am not really supposed to drink alcohol right now.\u201d oh, that stops the conversation right there", "that\u2019s brilliant", "yeah, well it stops the push", "but then it also starts another conversation like, \u201cwell, what kind of weird shit are you on?\u201d at any given point, i think it\u2019s fair to say that i could answer in the affirmative to \u201care you on any weird shit?\u201d i\u2019m almost always doing something odd", "it might not be a lot of stuff, but i\u2019m probably trying something new", "that stops people cold", "if they\u2019re like, oh, wow", "i mean, it could be tylenol", "if you\u2019re taking acetaminophen in any capacity, people may not realize this, but some absurd percentage of emergency room visits and liver failures are associated with high-dose acetaminophen, which is not that much", "it\u2019s something like two or three times the label allowable amount over 24 hours", "it\u2019s really a potent and potentially dangerous drug", "so, that\u2019s one", "\u201ci\u2019m actually on this.\u201d \u201ci\u2019m on a, b, or c,\u201d or \u201ci\u2019m on a bunch of weird stuff at the moment and i\u2019m just not supposed to drink.\u201d it works really well", "then second, and this is actually advice that richard branson gave on this podcast is, having club soda with a dash of cranberry juice or something like that", "just using that as your default go-to", "one thing that i do which is going to sound really odd and it is odd, but i have a superstition about \u201ccheers-ing,\u201d clinking glasses, when i don\u2019t have any alcohol in my glass", "interesting", "this is your tell", "this is something that well, it\u2019s kind of a tell", "but what i\u2019ll do is i will sometimes also go up to the bar and i\u2019ll say, just give me a tiny splash, like the equivalent amount that would be in a thimble or something like that and then i\u2019ll cut myself off at that", "that\u2019s the amount that allow myself", "that\u2019s another approach that i take to cut back on the booze", "you mentioned though that you\u2019ve been trying to learn at night and that the booze is not conducive to learning at night", "what are you trying to learn at night", "what types of things", "what\u2019s the format", "are you reading 100 pages a night or what is it", "honestly, have you heard of this coursera course called \u201clearning how to learn\u201d", "i have not", "who teaches it", "it\u2019s done by a couple professors", "i\u2019m actually in the middle of that right now", "another kind of biohacker recommended it to me", "apparently, it\u2019s the no", "1 watched course on coursera right now", "it\u2019s just been fascinating how they dig into the science of learning and how you go on this kind of focused or diffused mode and how to really go in and concentrate on something and when the optimal time is to learn", "it\u2019s all the science around learning", "i\u2019m just getting started with it", "that\u2019s what i\u2019ve been diving into and spending my nights watching those videos", "but it talks about the importance of actually getting away from your material", "so, getting really focused and setting a timer for 25 minutes maximum", "going really in depth on the course material and then backing away and going into this more relaxed mode", "they were talking about, who was it", "benjamin franklin", "i can\u2019t remember who it was that used to hold a pair of keys in their hand", "salvador dal\u00ed did this as well, actually", "hold a pair of keys in your hand and you kind of just go into this relaxed state thinking about what you want to learn, to where you almost fall asleep and when you drop the keys out of your hand and it wakes you up, that\u2019s when you go back and then you realize you were successful getting that relaxed", "you\u2019ll retain and become more creative", "i don\u2019t know", "it\u2019s just fascinating stuff", "i\u2019m just getting started with the course", "and it\u2019s free", "very cool", "yeah, the intervals and the duration of intervals for learning, along with break periods, is something that i\u2019ve experimented a lot with as it relates to language learning", "because it\u2019s so measurable, you can look at, say your recall of foreign vocabulary, assuming you\u2019re controlling for a few different variables, right", "adjectives are generally going to be harder than nouns, for instance", "but if you\u2019re controlling for that, you can look at what your retention is, say 48 hours later, for 100 words you attempted to learn in one session versus two sessions versus three sessions with different types of breaks", "i did that when i was looking at a few different languages, specifically in 2004, 2005", "actually, i\u2019ve never shown you these notes", "i have text edit documents with all of my notes on language learning for about a year-long period, looking at all this type of stuff", "there were some very clear patterns, such as focusing on the material right before bed with no interruption", "much like how it\u2019s recommended by many names both you and i know, that you meditate first thing in the morning before you brush your teeth, before you check your phone, before anything else", "when you have this tabula rasa blank state of sorts", "focusing on material that you want to consolidate in memory and recall later right before bed, at least in my experience, dramatically improves recall", "then, this is actually very important, not just doing that, but when you wake up, before doing anything else, which for me would override meditation, doing a recall exercise of some type", "i tend to use flashcards, to determine which have stuck and which have not", "so those that have not, since i\u2019m looking at language, i would give myself like a quarter of a second", "it couldn\u2019t be delayed because in speech, you\u2019re not going to have the luxury of sitting there paused for long periods of time", "it would go back into the rotation for review again throughout that day and later that night", "but that has proven really, really helpful", "how about exercise", "one of the things they mention in this course is this idea of doing cardiovascular exercise", "i believe it\u2019s post-learning something new", "apparently, this science was saying that it just sticks that much more", "i don\u2019t have any numbers in front of me, but it was something along those lines", "have you heard anything about that", "in terms of the timing of exercise, i have less clarity, but there\u2019s an entire book called spark that talks about, among other things, the role of exercise in education and learning, and would point to things like bdnf, the release of brain drive neurotrophic factor, which can be elicited through different types of exercise", "part of me thinks that when one says because these are the easiest to study, or very often the easiest to study, cardiovascular exercise, this is where it comes down to trying to become literate with reading scientific studies or understanding how things typically work", "as a couple of baselines, scientific studies usually use volunteer populations known as students", "those students have 45-minute class blocks or 60-minute class blocks", "so, to keep those students busy, people are very often disincentivized from using shorter-duration, high-intensity training or something like that", "weightlifting, for instance", "resistance training", "if you want to, as an experimenter, design something that requires as little monitoring as possible, it\u2019s like, all right, stick them on a stationary bike", "if you have people doing burpees or deadlifts, like you actually need to \u2013 i hate burpees", "yeah, but you actually need to pay attention, right", "you need to pay attention if people are lifting weights and so on", "there are more safety concerns", "so, just to point out perhaps the obvious, weightlifting is actually one of the most cardiovascular activities you could possibly engage in, but i won\u2019t digress into that", "you can look at a book called body by science for all of the details and why that is the case", "but it would make sense to me that exercise could certainly play a role in increasing cognitive function", "but one of the questions that i ask myself all the time, when, and this is a good question for people to ask themselves when they see a headline that makes a scientific claim, is what else could explain this", "what else might explain this", "if you\u2019re looking at cardiovascular exercise right after some type of cramming with material, you could make the argument that perhaps it\u2019s not the exercise at all, it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re going into a semi-mindless or meditative, repetitive period where they\u2019re able to, their subconscious somehow work on the material, right", "right", "well, this exactly what this course teaches is how to get into those periods", "yeah, 100 percent", "i have certainly seemed to observe that exercise in some capacity, for me, it\u2019s generally some type of resistance training, does have a positive effect on learning", "so, yet another reason to get off your ass, which is something i need to do more of", "i\u2019ve digressed", "i\u2019ve fallen off the train a little bit, kevin rose", "i\u2019ll be honest", "but i shall get back on the train", "fortunately, once you have a recipe that works, you have the confidence that you can get back on", "that\u2019s the good news, right", "say with the fast mimicking diet, not that you should use that for body composition, but fast mimicking diet or intermittent fasting, which a lot of people use your app zero for, for slow carb diet, plus a handful of things like kettle ball swings", "i just know this is why i\u2019m not stressed out about being off the rails", "i kind of make fun of myself about it", "because it\u2019s like look, if i just follow the prescription, like follow the algorithm for three to four weeks, there\u2019s no magic involved", "it will work and i will have less muffin top to grab when i\u2019m in the sauna, which will make me happy", "muffin top in the sauna is the worst", "you look down and you see that little layer, this little boop", "you also have like the glistening cinnabon effect because you\u2019re sweating", "it\u2019s a really unattractive look", "it\u2019s not a good look", "it\u2019s not good", "one thing i did want to talk about, which i think would be fun to chat about because we\u2019ve both done is, real quick, is tony robbins", "yeah, let\u2019s talk about it", "for sure", "so, i\u2019ve done two different tony robbins events", "upw, unleash the power within, which was my first event", "then, more recently in december of this last year, date with destiny, which is a longer event", "oh, you did that", "i didn\u2019t know you did date with destiny as well", "i did", "so, i\u2019ve done two events", "some people have had a bit of exposure to date with destiny through the i am not your guru documentary, which was co-produced, in fact, by someone who\u2019s been on this podcast, brian koppelman, a really accomplished filmmaker", "but what was your experience like", "your first tony robbins event", "it was kind of crazy", "thanks to you, i got hooked up with him", "i went down and got a chance to meet him and hang out with him", "i think that tony has proven himself now that he\u2019s been doing this for so long", "he\u2019s been doing it for 40+ years", "but i think that in the back of my mind, i remember when i was a little kid, the audiotape version, infomercial version of tony", "so, there was always this stigma in my mind that was like, is he trying to sell me something", "what\u2019s going on here", "i also watched his documentary and i was like, wow, this guy is clearly brilliant", "he takes this stuff very seriously and he\u2019s truly breaking through to people and helping people change their lives", "he was like, \u201ci\u2019m going to be in the bay area, you should come down.\u201d i was like, \u201cokay, that sounds awesome.\u201d i took a buddy of mine that has a lot of anxiety", "he shall go unnamed but he wanted to go", "he was like, \u201ckevin, let\u2019s do this.\u201d i was like, \u201cokay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d so, we went down for the three-day event", "i thought it was great", "i\u2019ve got to tell you", "you walk into it \u2013 and i was in arena where there was 12,000 people", "there are a lot of people there", "everybody is coming there for a different reason, right", "i was sitting across from a guy that had lost his legs and was previously a drug addict", "i think he had some infection in his legs or something and had to have them both amputated", "i was sitting next to someone that was running her own social media business and wanted to get better with her business and improve her finances", "she was getting through a relationship that she had just ended", "everyone had something to bring to the table", "of course, we all do", "if we\u2019re honest with ourselves, everyone has something they\u2019re trying to work on", "i went in there and day one was awesome", "tony got out there and he spoke for like 12 hours we were there", "until after midnight", "yeah, he\u2019s a complete mutant", "yeah, it\u2019s unbelievable", "i don\u2019t even know when he pees", "i have no idea when he uses the bathroom", "or drinks water", "yeah", "he\u2019s just a machine, the guy\u2019s a machine", "he\u2019s a machine", "i walked over the coals with him", "he was like, \u201cbring out some fresh coals for kevin!\u201d of course, they put like fresh, you actually walk over coals at the end of the night", "you\u2019ve done this, right", "i have, yeah", "did he bring out fresh coals for you", "i can\u2019t recall if he brought out fresh coals for me", "i think that might\u2019ve been the vip treatment you received", "it was a lot of fun", "i think the biggest takeaway for me was really a couple things", "one was definitely this thing called the wheel of life", "did you have to do that", "where you fill out your wheel", "i\u2019m sure i did", "and i should also point out that for the attendees at these events \u2013 and i have a little bit more to say about this \u2013 but the exercises that really \u2013 and there are very tactical, prescriptive exercises \u2013 but that the exercises that change someone else\u2019s trajectory and give them extremely concrete next steps that have an impact, are very often completely different exercises from those that affect the person right next to you", "it\u2019s really something to behold", "but tell us about the wheel of life", "the wheel of life was interesting in that he gives you these areas of your life and you\u2019re to rank them from 0 to 10 on how far along and how happy you are with those areas", "so, for example, physical body", "so, for me, i was like, for me, i give myself a 4 in this arena", "i could be doing a lot better", "then there\u2019s emotions and meaning", "another one is relationships", "another one is time", "another one is your career and your mission in life", "then there\u2019s finances", "then the last one is how you contribute", "how you give back", "how you celebrate and contribute", "so you go from 0 to 10 and you rank these out", "you\u2019ll see my wheel doesn\u2019t actually look like a wheel", "it\u2019s kind of lopsided, but that\u2019s by design", "by the time you look at this, it gives you a clear view of okay, i really need to step out how i contribute and give back", "that allowed me to go really deep in my own personal life and say, what does it mean to contribute and give back for me", "you and i have both done things in terms of going out", "like charity: water, the tony hawk foundation, and giving away money, but just supporting a cause and writing a check, i\u00a0 don\u2019t know how you feel about this, but for me, it doesn\u2019t really mean that i\u2019m giving back", "i don\u2019t really feel like i\u2019m contributing", "yes, i\u2019m giving cash, but i\u2019m not actually taking part in that process", "i\u2019m not actually really helping out", "anyone can write a check", "what does it mean for me to contribute", "the realization that i came to and actually there\u2019s some really powerful moments in this conference where they turn out the lights and they make you revisit certain times in your childhood and all these things", "i felt myself kind of tearing up because one of the things i realized is that i was not giving back and contributing in a meaningful way", "the thing that i came to and that i realized is that my mother was verbally abused by my father for many, many, many years", "definitely abusive behavior", "never physically harmed her, but i would say the mental hard is more bad, if not worse, than some of the physical harm", "i realized that i want to actually lean in and help out women that have been abused and that are currently in abusive relationships", "a goal of mine over the next couple years is finding the best possible way to contribute back to that", "not just in forms of another check, but actually how i can get involved", "and whether that means helping them build their products and build a better website or mobile apps or any way that i can enable and use my technology skills to help with their business would be something that would mean a lot to me", "so, that was a great experience to have", "i wouldn\u2019t have that if it wasn\u2019t for tony", "that was just one of many things that i got out of the weekend", "i would say that he\u2019s a badass", "it was pretty awesome", "yeah, he\u2019s a real master of his craft", "what i would say to folks who have a certain image of tony is that when you go to an event like this, i think the right way to approach it is to be skeptical but not cynical, and open to trying all of the exercises he suggests", "there are going to be components that may not agree with you in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of jumping around", "there\u2019s a lot of music", "there\u2019s a lot of noise, for lack of a better word", "a lot of those elements made me uncomfortable", "they\u2019re not things that i would seek out", "oh, my god", "i could not see you dancing and jumping around", "right", "it\u2019s just not my thing", "but the filter that i used going into it or the lens through which i was looking at it was it was made easier because one of my very close friends i\u2019ve known since college, who\u2019s had multiple company exits, is extremely, extremely accomplished, and he goes to unleash the power within every year as a reset", "he\u2019s been 11 times, maybe 12 now", "he\u2019s been to date with destiny six times", "this guy is not a seminar junkie", "he\u2019s not someone who avoids the work and goes to listen to a motivational speech so that he can feel better on a sugar high for two days and not take any next steps", "this is not that guy", "he is an operator", "so, the fact that he had been so many times really led me to want to stick with the entire event", "i\u2019m not going to lie", "i had hard points", "then i mentioned this to you and it may not be the exercise that had a large impact on you, but the dickens process that i ended up with tony including in tools of titans, one of my more recent books, because it had such a big impact, made the entire event an easy like 10 to 100 turn for me", "mm-hmm, that was the last day, too", "that\u2019s right", "so, just that 30 to 60-minute exercise led me to dramatically improve my relationship with my father, to take responsibility for certain things that i had been telling myself were unchangeable, to really buckle down and step into discomfort to make some meaningful changes", "those are changes \u2013 unleash the power within, i want to say i went to, now it\u2019s got to be three to five years ago \u2013 those changes, the ripple effects of those changes that i made then are still very tangible now", "then date with destiny, very similar", "but to go into it expecting that if you step into it and accept some level of discomfort and commit to trying everything, this is just my view, that at least 50 percent you\u2019re going to end up discarding", "probably 20 percent you\u2019re going to find really uncomfortable and you\u2019re going to dislike actively", "then like 10 to 25 percent you\u2019re going to go, holy shit, i can\u2019t believe how powerful that just was", "it\u2019s not a lot of handwavy, woo-woo ambiguity", "these exercises are really, really, really specific", "so, you don\u2019t have to accept tony as your one and only savior", "you don\u2019t have to believe that he is flawless because he is not", "he\u2019s just like everyone else", "he\u2019s an imperfect creature trying to do the best with the gifts and talents he\u2019s developed", "but the guy knows his shit", "he actually really cares", "as i\u2019ve gotten to know him over the last few years more and more so, i\u2019ve become more impressed with him, not less impressed", "that is at least, if one were thinking of attending one of these events, and i have zero vested interest in sending anyone to these events, other than they\u2019ve had a material impact on my life", "that\u2019s why i was happy to see that you were going to attend", "that they\u2019d go in with an open mind expecting that, much like if you\u2019ve read any type of book, you\u2019re not expecting every line to be a life-changing piece of gold", "you\u2019re hoping that net-net it\u2019s going to be worth the time that you invested", "that\u2019s been my takeaway", "that it\u2019s absolutely been worth the time invested", "yeah, 100 percent agree", "i think that like you, going into this was certainly a really uncomfortable thing for me in terms of when they first start the music and people come out on stage and they start dancing", "you can tell the people that have been there before, because they immediately like jump out of their seats and start rocking out and throwing their hands in the air", "i\u2019m thinking to myself, i hate dancing", "i hate dancing", "i\u2019ve never liked dancing with anyone", "my wife or anyone", "i always feel so awkward when i\u2019m doing it", "i\u2019m a geek that likes to sit in front of my computer at night", "then i thought something another friend had told me who had gone and said, \u201chey, kevin", "you just have to go with it", "if you want to get anything out of it, you have to realize that he\u2019s doing this by design to put you into a certain state.\u201d he wants to get you into an optimal state and an optimal \u2013 that can mean like, one example of one thing we did is we took something that was very serious to us, like a limiting belief that you had held so seriously and you say it out loud in a very joking and laughing way, and everybody, like 12,000 people are all doing this at the same time", "you\u2019re laughing and saying it", "it\u2019s like breaking it down in your mind and letting you know that you don\u2019t have to take it so seriously and you can joke about it and have fun with it because it\u2019s been forever since you\u2019ve probably ever done that in your life", "when was the last time you were able to take something that you held so seriously and so guarded and have a good time with it", "so, he knows how to set up these little traps for you that trick you into reframing things in your mind", "it really does change your long-term perspective on things", "dude, i\u2019m a fan", "i would definitely go back again", "i did the three-day event, the unleash the power within, the same one as you", "but yeah, i had fun with it", "so, thanks for helping out with that", "yeah, man", "my pleasure", "i would suggest also that as a point of social proof, and, of course, tony\u2019s fully aware of the sort of gravitas this would bring, but there are people, for instance, mark benioff of salesforce, which i think has more than $10 billion in annual revenue now, who will pointblank say that salesforce would probably not exist were it not for tony robbins", "and he still attends some of these events", "he was right behind me at date with destiny", "he\u2019s a big guy", "he and tony are very similar in size", "then you have paul tudor jones", "you have some of the most sophisticated traders and financial minds who have worked with tony for 10 to 20 years", "that\u2019s on an ongoing coaching basis because he does have very discrete, very tactical exercises and tools that help to find blind spots and fully leverage the things that you\u2019re good at and so on", "it\u2019s not easy", "it\u2019s not comfortable, but certainly i\u2019ve been very benefitted by the time that i\u2019ve spent considering these things", "i\u2019m biased because in high school, i read unlimited power by tony, which had an impact", "i then, when i got out of college and i had my first job and i was commuting in my piece of shit minivan, the green machine, which was just a complete disaster of a car but i was trapped on 101 in the bay area, for people who know, just bumper-to-bumper in rush hour, to and from mountain view to san jose to work, and i would listen to this used set", "i couldn\u2019t afford the full set, a new copy, so i had personal power 2 in cassette tape, and listened to that, which helped me get to the point where i started my first company", "tony\u2019s made these appearances at very opportune moments in my life", "like i said, i don\u2019t go to him for all things", "i don\u2019t think tony has the answer to everything", "but with particular types of self-imposed narratives and handicaps that you have built you\u2019re or walls around certain types of thinking or certain types of emotions that perhaps served you very well in the past but no longer serve you, he is exceptionally good and helping you work through all of that", "i just love that this whole genre, the self-help genre, is not as frowned upon as it used to be", "i don\u2019t know if you remember, but probably 10, 15, 20 years ago, if you went to that area of the bookstore, you were like, look it, who\u2019s in the self-help section", "there must be something wrong with them", "seriously", "that used to be the case", "now it\u2019s gone and he\u2019s probably at the center of it", "but it\u2019s become this idea of not self-help, it\u2019s really just this idea that we\u2019re all on a journey of lifelong learning and we all are done bsing ourselves and there\u2019s not a single person that has all of life figured out, so why don\u2019t we all actively, openly work on this together", "i think it\u2019s awesome", "yeah", "i should also say that as one point, as an example, i was interviewed on the bbc", "they wanted to talk about the self-help genre", "i knew it was going to be setup, right", "i knew that they wanted me to defend self-help and they wanted to attack self-help", "i knew when i was going in that this is what it was going to be", "or i figured it out about an hour beforehand when i got some notes and i was like, \u201coh, i see where this is going.\u201d they bring me out \u2013 this is a television show \u2013 and they say, \u201cgood evening, mr", "ferriss", "we just wanted to talk about,\u201d dah-dah-dah, bio, blah, blah, blah, \u201cwhat is your general opinion of the self-help genre?\u201d or something along those lines", "in effect, i said, \u201ci think 99.9% of it is just horseshit.\u201d i said, \u201cit pains me sometimes to be associated with the label \u2018self-help\u2019 for x, y, and z reasons.\u201d then they didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on, right", "because i\u2019d taken their side of the argument, which was kind of hilarious", "that\u2019s funny", "then i said, \u201cbut, at the same time, i think the label \u2018self-help\u2019 has in many cases an unfairly negative connotation because if you look at almost any type of reading, whether it\u2019s a novel where people want to escape, or it\u2019s nonfiction, where they\u2019re hoping to learn more about let\u2019s call it andrew carnegie, or you name the figure, there is some motive behind that, which they hope to help them.\u201d whether it\u2019s a shift of emotion, the gathering of knowledge so they can impress people at a dinner party or otherwise", "and that if i were to look at who i would say potentially emulate in the world of self-help, it would probably be like, and this is a name you brought up earlier, ben franklin", "who most certainly wrote extensively about what we consider today to be self-help", "but he\u2019s not lumped into the category of potential \u2013 and these people do exist, certainly \u2013 charlatans, who are just selling a bill of goods that doesn\u2019t deliver", "there are plenty of people who have not walked the walk and talk extensively about their expertise and make recommendations and prescriptions", "there are people all over the world in every possible disciple who do this and a lot of them tend to concentrate in this section of the bookstore called \u2018self-help,\u2019 unfortunately", "but that alone isn\u2019t enough to disqualify something", "certainly, if we look at the popularity of tutorials on youtube, for instance, in any possible subject matter", "if you look at the popularity of the creative lives and the courseras and so on", "everyone now has access to expertise that even 10 years ago would\u2019ve cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to access, if they had the ability at all", "you look at harvard, mit, stanford", "many of these schools are putting their courses online, in some cases, for free access", "i know people who have taught themselves to code in this way", "all of that is self-help, right", "it\u2019s important, i think, that people not disqualify exploring certain realms because of a label that really represents a concept which may or may not apply to what it is you\u2019re examining", "yeah, i mean, there\u2019s going to be scammers in every genre, too", "i love how joe rogan, i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the posts that he\u2019s done recently, but he does video of these martial arts", "the legit as fuck", "yeah", "that\u2019s his caption", "where they can throw people with their mind", "yeah", "yeah", "joe rogan puts up these fake martial arts videos", "i mean, they\u2019re not fake", "they\u2019re videos of people who actually believe that what\u2019s happening is happening", "but these self-described martial arts masters throwing people across the room with their qi explosions and so on", "his caption is usually, \u201clegit as fuck.\u201d or #legitasfuck", "it\u2019s so good", "it\u2019s so good", "yeah, there\u2019s a lot of nonsense out there, but it doesn\u2019t mean that everything within a certain category is nonsense", "it doesn\u2019t mean you should spend your entire life filtering for the one percent", "but also, there are ways that you can assess the validity of different paths", "quite frankly, i would recommend for those people who haven\u2019t \u2013 well, i\u2019ll give you two recommendations", "one is you can look at the back of the 4-hour body, if you already have it, there\u2019s an appendix which is effectively how to spot bad science", "it will help you to not trick yourself and also to get better at avoiding being tricked", "so, that\u2019s one recommendation", "not to seem like i\u2019m selling my own book, the excerpts for that appendix are from a book called bad science by a doctor named ben goldacre, which is absolutely fantastic", "so, if you just want to be scientifically literate or better able to separate the signal from the noise with the deluge of information that we are assaulted by every day, i would highly recommend that you check out one or both of those resources", "i was going to ask you, tools of titans, obviously in your books there have been tons of book recommendations", "there was that one kid, do you remember the kid, that took all and he created, he took all the books out of your recommendations and ranked them", "yeah, he ranked them or just organized them as thumbnails", "yeah, i do remember that", "the idea was that what is the most recommended book inside tools of titans across the board by all the people that were in that book", "kind of stack-ranking them based on the votes", "do you have that list anywhere", "do you have a list of like the most recommended books by all of your guests", "i do, actually", "i\u2019ll pull it up right now because i put it on the blog for everybody", "that\u2019s a great way to cut through all the crap, you know", "yeah, i put it up on the blog", "if you give me a second, i will find where it is", "this might take a second", "i\u2019m looking at tribe of mentors, the most recent", "where would i find this", "if you go onto tim.blog and search tools of titans books", "we can put a link in the show notes, right", "we\u2019ll put a link in the show notes", "this will be the smarter way to do it", "if you want to see a page where the most commonly recommended books from tools of  titans and from tribe of mentors, combined, you\u2019re looking at about 500 different world-class performers of all different disciplines, ranging from top professional athletes to chess prodigies, to former generals, certainly 12+ billionaires, then you will get to see rank ordered in terms of frequency which books are most recommended", "i will put those in the show notes and you guys can find that at tim.blog/podcast", "if you want to see of these people who are the best at what they do, which books across disciplines do they recommend most often", "a few of them, just off the bat for people who are curious: man\u2019s search for meaning by viktor frankl; poor charlie\u2019s almanac by charlie munger; seeking wisdom by peter bevelin; and certainly atlas shrugged, even though it\u2019s a controversial book, by ayn rand, comes up a lot in terms of developing a sense of personal agency", "i think that has popped up quite a lot", "and many more", "but i\u2019ll give you the full list because there are some that pop up quite frequently that you won\u2019t recognize at all", "those are, to me, oftentimes the really fun ones to explore", "awesome", "yeah, i\u2019ve got a bunch of audible credits waiting to be spent", "so, i\u2019ll do that", "awesome, man", "well, i think this is a solid catch-up", "yeah", "thanks for having me on", "it was fun to chat", "where can people learn more about kevin rose, find you on the interwebs", "certainly", "my podcast is available at kevinrose.com", "then also if you want to check out my free meditation app, it\u2019s 100 percent free, a little bit more traditional meditation", "it\u2019s called oak and you can do that at oakmeditation.com", "nice and succinct", "no social", "yeah, you know, twitter @kevinrose", "but i don\u2019t know that i use it that much anymore", "i\u2019m more a newsletter guy", "if you go to my website, you can sign up for my newsletter", "i do a once-a-month newsletter", "that\u2019s kind of what i use", "it\u2019s a good newsletter", "i subscribe to it, which i can\u2019t say for many", "yeah, twitter has turned into a bit of a nasty neighborhood on most days", "you just feel like you\u2019re minding your business, whistling, walking down the street, then you have people throwing potted plants at your head", "and then facebook is a whole shit show", "so, it\u2019s like, that\u2019s the worst kind of show", "what to do", "go back to the tried and true", "instagram", "instagram or email", "all right, my man", "well, thanks so much for taking the time", "i hope to see you soon", "come visit austin", "got a barrel sauna waiting for you", "i will", "awesome", "see ya", "see ya", "to everyone listening or watching on the youtubes, you can find links to everything that we\u2019ve talked about in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast", "until next time, be safe, do not take meth for fun, follow professional advice with anything medically related, and live the examined life", "just because it is self-help doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t help you", "i\u2019ll leave with that"]}
