usually my job to deconstruct world-class performers to tease out the habits, routines, breakfasts, favorite books, etc. that you can apply to your own life, but I\u2019ve had far too much gin for that. This episode is a special edition. It is a trunk dialing Q&A with you guys \u2013 my listeners and fans. I solicited phone numbers from folks who wanted to receive a call from me. It is a Friday night and if you want to know about the gin I had, well, you\u2019re going to have to sign up for 5-Bullet Friday. That\u2019s where I talk about such things. fourhourworkweek.com/Friday, all spelled out. But I talk about in this particular case, things ranging from parenting advice based on advice from my friends and podcast guests, to how to get started in podcasting, to thinking about jumping from one industry to the next, to considering moves from say the East Coast to the West Coast of the U.S., and many, many, many, many, many other questions that are alcohol-infused for your entertainment delight. I hope you enjoy it. I was very happy with how this turned out and without further ado, as I always say, please enjoy this Q&A, answering some of your most burning questions from somewhere around 5 to 15 people. That is about it as far as preambles go. So please enjoy and as always, thank you for listening. [Phone rings] Hello? Josh: Hello. Tim Ferriss: Hi, is this Josh? Josh: It is. Tim Ferriss: Josh, this is Tim Ferriss. How are you this evening? Josh: Doing well. How are you? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m splendid. I am having a disgusting cocktail of some type of blueberry sparkling water with gin. I\u2019m getting an evil eye for that comment. But I am glad you dropped in your phone number and name. So I\u2019m all yours for the next couple minutes. Josh: Yeah, well I appreciate it, man. I mean, if I can take a moment to just say thanks for everything that you do and man, my whole family just loves all the lessons and teachings that you throw out there for us. It\u2019s been awesome. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, man. I appreciate that. Josh: So I won\u2019t take too much time, but yeah, I mean, I have a family of four children and we\u2019ve kind of been on this kind of crazy trajectory since your first book and living in southern California and kind of living it up based on the principles learned from that book. So it\u2019s been awesome. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations, man. Thank you. Josh: Yeah, and then the second book came out and I dropped 40 pounds in 2010 and been able to keep it off, so whole life\u2019s been impacted. So really appreciate that. Tim Ferriss: Nice work, man. Josh: Yeah, I\u2019ll cut to the question. My question is \u2013 kind of back to my kids \u2013 I\u2019ve got four kids, I\u2019m 37. My oldest is 15, the next one is 14. So I\u2019ve got two kids in high school right now. You often ask the question to your guests about what would they tell themselves at age 20 or in their early 20s as they\u2019re getting started. I want to look a little bit earlier and look at age 14 to age 15 and the reason why is because you\u2019ve often said in your past that you were most impacted maybe when you were a freshman or early high school age by coaches, teachers, trip to Japan, whatever. I feel like just observing my kids, it\u2019s such a pivotal time in their life. But what would your toolkit look like for teenagers and maybe for yourself, but also as a parent, if you were a parent of teenagers. What would your toolkit look like for those kids as a parent? Tim Ferriss: Great question. I should say, first of all, that as you probably know, I don\u2019t have kids. So I think that I may be a bit of an armchair quarterback in answering this, but based on my conversations with close friends of mine who I consider in this case to be very good dads, I think I can speak to it. That would include quite a few of the podcast guests. So whether that is say Josh Waitzkin, who I think has a lot to offer, or Jamie Foxx or others. There are a few things that come to mind and you\u2019re right that I was very impacted between say 14 and 16 by coaches and a handful of teachers. I do think that freshman/sophomore window is a critical inflection point; whether they\u2019re going in the right direction or the wrong direction, for a lot of kids. It certainly was true for me, which is why I wanted to teach ninth grade for a long time. I thought that was my ultimate destination was teaching ninth grade. But to your question, I would say that there are a few things I would emphasize and there are different ways to emphasize. In other words, there are the principles and then there\u2019s how you convey those principles, right? So the first would be quite simply you are the average of the five people you associate with most and how financially, academically, physically, you are going to be the average of the people you spend the most time with, so you need to choose and should choose your friends very carefully. If you think that you can be the standout A-student, top-performing athlete, etc. among a bunch of misfits who you happen to like, you are mistaken. That just is not the case. It\u2019s true for adults; it\u2019s true for kids, right? Now that could come off as somewhat preachy. There are other ways, I think, that you can condition your kids to ultimately be more likely to succeed in academics and in life. One is getting them accustomed to failure and being humbled very early on, or at least on a regular basis. So if you were to ask someone like Jocko Willink, for instance, the former Navy SEAL commander who\u2019s been on the podcast, Jiu Jitsu would be a great tool for men or women, boys or girls. I think that is a great training ground and a lot of those individual sports have an accountability that sometimes you are lacking in team sports. I played team sports when you\u2019re on, say the wrestling mat, psychologically it\u2019s just a different kettle of fish. You deserve the credit or the blame for your successes or failures, respectively. Then I would say last, the next thing that comes to mind, at least, is called Grit, G-R-I-T, which is about resilience. It looks a lot at kids, specifically. Josh Waitzkin (who is the basis and the inspiration for Searching for Bobby Fischer, the movie and the book) turned me on to this and I\u2019m blanking on the author\u2019s name, but it\u2019s really about teaching your kids to focus on hard work and not intrinsic capability. In other words, they\u2019re able to develop an internal locus of control where they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re dependent on external factors for success. Josh does that in a bunch of interesting ways. For instance, when he was raising (or is raising), his son Jack, from the very early days he noticed parents talking about good weather/bad weather. We can\u2019t go out, it\u2019s bad weather. We should go out, it\u2019s good weather. And he flipped it on its head and, of course, this wouldn\u2019t apply to your high school kids, but it does in other contexts. He would say, \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, rainy day, Jack. Why don\u2019t we go out?\u201d And he would always go outside and play with his kid in the rain. I think there are ways to simulate that and create conditions for that. The other thing is not to make it too curriculum based, but I really feel like if you are able to get your kids in some fashion excited about improving their written or spoken communication in any capacity, I feel like that is a huge competitive advantage in life. You can add the ability to public speak or write clearly on top of any other skillset and you\u2019re automatically in like the top 25 percent in almost any arena, if that makes sense. Josh: Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. That might be the first time I\u2019ve heard you maybe say that in that way. And I understand that being my age now. How do you think you teach that? Again, thinking about as a parent you\u2019re a teacher, but half the time your kids don\u2019t listen to you because you are their parent. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Josh: Which is maybe the piece of the puzzle that you\u2019re missing you don\u2019t have the kids, but when you think about \u2013 because I think that is an excellent principle and it\u2019s something that I maybe wish I\u2019d spent more time on at that age. How would you think getting through to your kids with those specific skills: writing, speaking? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I would look at who influences them, first of all. So who do they listen to? I would actually take an indirect path. So if your kids are prone \u2013 and I think teenagers are particularly prone to being like, oh, Dad\u2019s preaching again or whatever the hell it happens to be, right? Figuring out who they listen to. My Mom did this in a very interesting way when I was actually 15. Side note: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever talked about this publicly. 15, I was in Japan, and I\u2019ve always suffered from sensitivity to heat and I\u2019ve actually been hospitalized a few times. It\u2019s a long story, but I have lung issues, respiratory issues. So I was hospitalized in Japan at one point because I insisted on training through the pain, wearing a judo outfit, in like 90 percent humidity and 100\u00b0 weather, which was stupid, right? My Mom knew on some level that I might not listen to her or take it with a grain of salt or something like that, so she went to a previous martial arts instructor who had a huge impact on me, who I took very seriously, and had him record a VHS tape. I\u2019m not kidding. This is back in the day. She shipped it to Japan, where he sort of gave me like a man-to-man talking to, so to speak, about the risks and payoffs, potential benefits, downsides, etc. of all this stuff and that was the intervention that worked. So I think that there are different ways to reach kids depending on who they listen to. I think that\u2019s the path of least resistance. So if you looked at \u2013 and they may be too young for this \u2013 but, for instance, Warren Buffett cites as his best ever investment a Dale Carnegie course in public speaking. Josh: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: So if the richest man in the world (or one of the richest men in the world), certainly most successful equity investor of all time, potentially might pull some weight, then that could be an indirect way to do it. It\u2019s to somehow expose them to that in a non-preachy way. The other way to do it, quite frankly, is to impress the hell out of them with someone who is an incredible public speaker or writer. So it could be as simple as exposing them to a commencement speak from someone like Neil Gaiman. His \u201cMake Good Art\u201d commencement speech is just incredible. That could be another path. Those are a few things that come to mind. In terms of writing, I would say if there\u2019s any type of writing that might get them hooked on reading that is probably the Trojan horse into getting them to focus on better communication themselves. I think getting them hooked on if it\u2019s science fiction, maybe it\u2019s something from Neal Stephenson. If it\u2019s any type of writing, if it\u2019s non-fiction, maybe it\u2019s something from John McPhee. Something that makes them go, holy shit, I thought I knew what good writing was. Ohmygod, like this guy is amazing or this gal is amazing, would be a great way to go. It doesn\u2019t have to be your recommendation to them to focus on the writing. It could be the subject matter. So for instance, if \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to think of a good example \u2013 maybe the autobiography of Andre Agassi, which was ghost written. It wasn\u2019t written by Andre Agassi, but the ghost writer is just a phenomenal storyteller and there are a lot of life lessons and competitive lessons learned in that book. It\u2019s a phenomenal read, right? So you could suggest it just because of the autobiography. They\u2019re going to finish the book and they\u2019re going to go, holy crap that was an amazing book. That might be what trips the wire and gets them interested in writing. But I think the soft approach is probably \u2013 and this is just, again, speaking as a complete poser who does not have kids \u2013 I would say just knowing how I was as a teenager, I think the indirect Jedi mind trick approach is probably the better way to go when possible. Josh: That is really good. That is really good advice. I actually think you come from a position of advantage because you don\u2019t have kids, which means you don\u2019t have the emotional connection of them pissing you off or making you happy or trying to protect them in any way, so I actually think that is a position of advantage because it\u2019s just different having kids. Tim Ferriss: I might borrow that, yeah. Josh: No, good stuff. I actually really appreciate that story about your mom and you\u2019ve mentioned her a couple times. She seems like a phenomenal woman, so tell her thank you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I will. My parents are staying with me for the next three weeks, so I should have an opportunity shortly to let them know. But I tell you what, man, hopefully that\u2019s helpful. I highly recommend the book, Grit. I think that will touch on a lot of what we talked about. If you haven\u2019t heard the Josh Waitzkin episodes, I would definitely listen to those because he talks about his son a lot. Even though his son is much younger, I think the way he thinks about it and the architecture of his mind, the principles that he applies are still extremely applicable to a high school aged kid, for sure. Josh: Yeah, no, for sure. I have and actually have had my kids listen to different pieces of those. Right now, I have the two youngest listening to The Graveyard Book. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, that\u2019s a great one. Josh: We\u2019re all kind of hooked. That one\u2019s phenomenal and we\u2019re all hooked on that one. I appreciate it. I won\u2019t take up any more of your time. I know you\u2019ve got a busy night ahead of you, so I appreciate it and thank you again. Tim Ferriss: For sure, man. I appreciate you reading my stuff and more than that, putting it into practice. I\u2019m stoked your kids are listening to The Graveyard Book. That\u2019s a winner. Josh: Yeah, okay, man. Good luck. Tim Ferriss: All right, man. Have a good night. Good luck. Bye. [Phone rings] Matt: This is Matt. Tim Ferriss: Hey, Matt. This is Tim Ferriss calling. How are you, sir? Matt: Hey, Tim. How are you? Good. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m good. Is that a Portland accent that I hear? Matt: Portland is a bit further west and south. It\u2019s Australian. Tim Ferriss: I was just looking at your number. Well, where are you in Australia? Matt: Well, I\u2019m actually in New York. Tim Ferriss: You are? Matt: I live sort of outside of Melbourne, but was speaking at New York Comic Con, well yesterday I guess it was now. So yeah, here until tomorrow. Tim Ferriss: Good man. Comic Con. I\u2019ve still never been to any version of Comic Con, but I have been to Melbourne, which I guess I live in the Melbourne of the United States, meaning San Francisco. Matt: You do. Tim Ferriss: Very similar towns. So I\u2019m all \u2013 Matt: Yeah, I was there on Tuesday actually. Tim Ferriss: Wow, you are a jet setter. I thought I traveled a lot. Matt: Not usually. You just caught me on a good week. Tim Ferriss: What were you speaking about at Comic Con? Matt: About how to teach people to be heroes in real life. That\u2019s kind of my field. I do a lot of trainings with kids. I\u2019m just sort of getting into adults as well. But sort of combining acknowledging psychology and getting into some habits to put in practice so that you\u2019re going to be the person who stands up instead of being a bystander. And then putting it into play with sort of physical stuff as well. I worked with Dan Edwardes with Parkour Generations in London and we\u2019re doing some work with Joe De Sena early next year. That kind of stuff. Getting prepped. Tim Ferriss: Oh, be careful with that Joe De Sena. He might make you carry a kettle bell up and down a mountain for 5 hours or 12, or 76. Matt: Yeah, no. I\u2019m very wary of that. Tim Ferriss: Well, that sounds like good work, man. What can I answer for you, if anything? Matt: Well, I listen to the podcast and I keep hearing you get close to talking about heroes and heroism. Whether it\u2019s talking about the hero\u2019s journey. I remember you talking to Jon Favreau sort of about your general interest in writing fiction and how the hero\u2019s journey plays into that. God, who was the guy recently you had on? Shep Gordon talking about how our heroes have changed from now to 30 years ago, what that looks like. So I\u2019m just curious to hear from you who are your heroes? What does that mean to you? Tim Ferriss: Ooh, that\u2019s a good one. Well, I would say that the first people to come to mind are a handful of folks who were merry pranksters, of sorts, but very good in multiple fields and maybe this is just to make myself feel better, but I view these as professional dilettantes of sorts. They were willing to experiment as amateurs in multiple fields. So a few of the people who come to mind are Richard Feynman, who was a physicist and an incredible teacher, but was also an accomplished safe cracker, bongo player, you name it. His book, Surely You Must be Joking, Mr. Feynman, is one of my favorites. So he is right at the top of the list. Ben Franklin would be right at the top of the list. I think his biography by Walter Isaacson is fantastic. He was a real character. He was a publisher in many ways, and a printer, rather, before he became any diplomat. Just a hilarious character. So I think those are two who come to mind. On top of that, you have a handful of folks from my own life, who would include my wrestling coach in high school, John Buxton. It would include my guidance counselor of sorts or my resident advisor in high school, named Richard Greenleaf, who is a reverend. I think what all these \u2013 Matt: What are the reasons behind them? Tim Ferriss: Well, I think they are actually related to the first two. They all question the consensus reality, in a sense, to use a phrase from Eric Weinstein and Peter Thiel, insomuch as I was told by my guidance counselor, for instance, in high school that I should not apply to Princeton, where I ended up going as an undergrad. At the time, I didn\u2019t really have the toolkit to ask myself what is this person\u2019s incentive? And their incentive is, of course, to be able to say 80 percent of my advisees got into their first choice college. Well, that produces some perverse behavior in the sense that the easiest way to accomplish that goal is to have kids lower their sights, right? So Richard Greenleaf was one who said to me, \u201cI think you can get in. I think you should apply. I think that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d What was able to convince me to believe in myself when other people effectively told me not to. John Buxton, similarly, was a hard ass in the bet way possible, who just didn\u2019t tolerate people or, in this case, students thinking that they weren\u2019t capable of what he knew them to be capable of, if that makes sense. I think one of the downfalls in my mind of modern, at least U.S. society or societal norms \u2013 and I suspect this applies elsewhere in the commonwealth probably \u2013 is that you have a political correctness that leads to everyone or a lot of people treating others with kid gloves. I think that is a disservice in that you are, in fact, woefully underpreparing people for reality if you don\u2019t give them tough love. If you look at John Buxton and, for instance, if you look at the wrestling team \u2013 and he was much more that a wrestling coach. He was an English teacher. He raised I think hundreds of millions of dollars for the endowment of the school I attended, which was St. Paul\u2019s, after public school. He is a very multi-faceted guy. He was the one to say no, you\u2019re not going to quit because I know you\u2019re capable of more. Go do what you have to do. If you\u2019re feeling sick because you\u2019re training too hard, go puke in the bucket over there and after you return from the corner, you\u2019re going to train for another two hours. At the end of those two hours, you\u2019re like oh, shit; I\u2019m actually capable of 50 percent more than I thought I was. In that way, they were able to make people around them think they were capable of more than they had previously thought. That\u2019s a tremendous super power in a way. Yeah, so that\u2019s why they would fall into a similar category. Matt: Absolutely, yeah. I think you\u2019ve had some interaction with Jennifer Miller? She was maybe a case study in 4-Hour Workweek? She traveled the world with her kids. She just wrote a post yesterday about her now-20-year-old, I think, daughter, who\u2019s sort of struggling through math in college and just was talking about their whole education philosophy and it was we\u2019re going to push you. We\u2019re going to teach you Latin when you\u2019re five and we\u2019re going to make you do math all the way through to twelfth grade because it\u2019s going to help you. You may hate it and you may scream at us, but you\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s not happening in the school systems anywhere. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I think that it\u2019s very important, if anything, I try to do this with my audience en masse, which can be challenging of course when you\u2019re dealing with millions of people, is to say okay, you think you\u2019re capable of X, but I would vote for myself and for everyone listening that\u2019s actually bullshit and you\u2019re capable of X plus 20 percent, at the very least. So let\u2019s push for that and you only know what you\u2019re capable of if you push yourself close to the breaking point. Certainly as a student, I was selling myself short; as an athlete, I was selling myself short. What the John Buxtons of the world taught me was you can and should dream bigger. Don\u2019t be so impressed by All Americans in sport X. Don\u2019t be so impressed by someone who placed in the top 10 in XYZ national competition. That is actually within reach if you apply yourself and work hard, but you\u2019re going to have to endure incredible amounts of discomfort. Period. That\u2019s it. I think that the people I view as heroes in my life are those who have forced me to have uncomfortable conversations, do uncomfortable things. Because I think that whatever we view as success is probably just an inch outside of our sphere of comfort, if that makes sense. So the people who push you beyond that are the people you should thank. The people who say everything is great, everything is going to be fine, there\u2019s a place for that but if that is their unified line for all circumstances, they\u2019re not doing you any favors, if that makes sense. Matt: Yeah, definitely. If you do well enough, you don\u2019t have to worry, right? It\u2019s just get to this stand and then you\u2019ll be all good. There\u2019s no pushing beyond that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I know that, for instance, if you look at New Zealand or you look at Australia, you hear a lot about \u201ctall poppy syndrome,\u201d and that\u2019s not something that people in the U.S. hear very much. In effect, it\u2019s actually very related to something in Japanese, which is the nail that sticks out will get hammered down. But tall poppy syndrome being if someone really sticks out and strives to be excellent, they get cut down by their peers, right? So I would say complementary skillset that the heroes I mentioned in part is they have, at one point or another, been the one against the many and they\u2019re able to help not just teach but condition their students to be able to face criticism and to be able to dismiss criticism when necessary to do what needs to be done. That\u2019s not a comfortable process. It just is not. Matt: Yeah, and things being uncomfortable is critical for any potential hero too. You\u2019ve got to be comfortable stepping out of the crowd, doing the thing that no one else is doing. It\u2019s a thing a lot of people have to practice. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, just a pre-req. It\u2019s a straight pre-req. Not to quote my own book, because I hate people who do that but I\u2019m drunk enough that I\u2019ll do that, which is there\u2019s a line \u2013 and the only reason I bring it up is that it\u2019s one of the most highlighted on Kindle, is \u2013 your success in life, by and large, can be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have. That is a skill you can practice. That is a skill you can develop. That is a coachable skill. That\u2019s why, for a long time, I had actually \u2013 and it\u2019s still on my refrigerator in New York \u2013 is a magnet that says \u201cEvery day do one thing that scares you.\u201d In effect; I\u2019m paraphrasing. That\u2019s a quote from, I think it\u2019s Eleanor Roosevelt. It is a reminder that developing these abilities is a habit. It is not a decision; it is a habit. You have to condition yourself. Just like weight training or anything else. Matt: That\u2019s a habit of heroism. That sums up my whole work is if you practice it, you are going to be the one that steps up and helps when needed. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, exactly. Cool, man. Well, I tell you what. I\u2019ve got to hop because I\u2019m realizing I have quite a few phone calls to make. Matt: You have, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Very good question. So thank you for that. Matt: Thank you. I appreciate the time. Tim Ferriss: For sure, man. Matt: Enjoy the rest of your night, which will no doubt get more amusing. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. It\u2019ll get more amusing. I know you Aussies know how to drink. I don\u2019t, so this will be even more ridiculous. Have a good weekend. Matt: All right, you too. Tim Ferriss: All right, bye. [Phone rings] Tim Ferriss: Hello, is this Ryan? Ryan: This is Ryan. Tim Ferriss: Ryan, this is Tim Ferriss. How the hell are you? Ryan: Hey, man. I\u2019m doing good. How are you? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m great. Where are you? Ryan: I\u2019m at home watching some playoff baseball. Tim Ferriss: Sweet. Ooh, I heard somebody in the background too. Ryan: That\u2019s my wife. Tim Ferriss: Hi, wife. I am all yours for the next however many minutes. It depends on how longwinded I am. But yeah man, fire away. Whatever you want to do. Ryan: Cool. The question I had prepared was, I know that you get stopped on the street from time to time when you\u2019re out in public and I was wondering if you could describe one maybe awkward or funny fan interaction and then one maybe especially memorable fan interaction that you\u2019ve had? Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good one. Yes, I can. Especially since I am super powered with the performance enhancer known as gin at the moment. The first is awkward. Ohmygod, so many awkward interactions. So I remember at South by Southwest, probably two years ago I was on an elevator literally kissing my girlfriend going down, who was on the step above me and a kind of nerdy, Aspergersy guy reached over her shoulder as we are kissing to tap my shoulder to start pitching me on a start-up. I would say that\u2019s pretty high on the awkward scale. I\u2019ve had between \u2013 well, at least 10, maybe more than 20, always guys, well, obviously, you\u2019ll realize in the context, who have followed me into a bathroom and I\u2019d be standing at a urinal and they would pitch over my shoulder like breathing onto my neck, their start-up. These are all start-up pitch related. I have to tell everybody out there, it doesn\u2019t matter how good your pitch is if you\u2019re breathing on my neck when I have my penis in my hand. It\u2019s not a good particular setup for a high close rate, I would say. So that would be very high on the awkward list. I\u2019ve had some people, and I think living in San Francisco, I have a high percentage \u2013 not a high percentage, but a reasonable percentage of low EQ, high IQ folks. I\u2019ve had people come over to me when I\u2019m having dinner with someone and literally just pull a chair over and sit down at my dinner table to pitch me start-up pitches, which is, again, not ideal protocol for getting a high close rate. So those are a couple of the awkward ones. One memorable one, and this is the way you should do it, quite frankly, is I\u2019ve had a handful of people come up to me at different events and it\u2019s after I\u2019ve given a keynote or something like that so there are many people who are asking me questions, pitching me things. They very simply say, \u201cI know you\u2019re super busy right now; you\u2019re going to be occupied for the next couple of hours. Here is a quick pitch that I wrote down. I think you\u2019ll find it interesting,\u201d and they hand me a letter. That is, I think, the most methodical and smart way to go about it. If you\u2019re going to pitch me something \u2013 and I\u2019m fine with being pitched \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be tricked. I don\u2019t want to be seduced with a bunch of unsolicited favors and then \u201cOh, by the way, I have my book coming out in the three weeks. Could you give me a blurb?\u201d I don\u2019t like that. I\u2019m fine with explicit pitches, but in an environment where you are competing with potentially hundreds of people who want to ask me something or pitch me something, the best way you can stand out is to give me something that I stick in my pocket that I can review later on my own time. Very few people do that. At a given event of say even 5,000 attendees, I will get maybe two of those. So I would say those are the first memorable interactions that come to mind because they\u2019re very effective. I think that\u2019s a smart way to approach pitching busy people when you meet them in person. It\u2019s not to actually verbally deliver the pitch, but is to give them something you\u2019ve taken the time to make as perfect as possible on paper and give to them. Ryan: Cool. Well, that\u2019s the only question I had. I want to keep it brief so you can talk to all the other people who are on the list. If it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like to maybe end the call with just a quick challenge for everyone in the podcast listening audience. I know on your 36th birthday you gave up your birthday to raise funds for charity: water. I just wanted to challenge everyone in the audience to do the same. I think charity: water is a great organization. I\u2019m not affiliated with them; I don\u2019t work for them, but I think they\u2019re just amazing. I think Scott Harrison built something really cool and they\u2019re just doing amazing work all around the world. For everyone who\u2019s interested, if you go to charitywater.org, you can set up a birthday campaign. It\u2019s super easy; it just takes a few minutes. Like Tim, Tim raised over $100,000 for his birthday and people all over the world have had campaigns that have raised thousands of dollars for a worthwhile cause. So I just want to challenge everyone in the audience. I think it\u2019s a worthwhile cause. Check it out and thank you so much for your time, Tim. I really appreciate it. Have a good rest of your night. Tim Ferriss: For sure, man. That\u2019s a good challenge. I second that. And if you just want to see also, for those people listening who are like man, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to do that. But, I would say if you want to see how a non-profit can structure and promote itself in part using design in a very smart way, then charity: water, just for that reason alone, if you want to get a mini-MBA in how to use design to promote a non-profit, which is in and of itself very difficult, then you should check out charity: water. So I agree with you wholeheartedly. Thanks for the question. Have a great weekend. Ryan: No problem. Thank you, Tim. Tim Ferriss: All right, man. Bye. [Phone rings] Bobby: Hey, this is Bobby. Leave me a message and I\u2019ll call you back if I like you. Tim Ferriss: Bobby, damnation! This is Tim Ferriss. I\u2019ve had way too much gin and I\u2019m prepared to make an ass of myself and I\u2019m afraid we have missed our opportunity to connect. Have a glorious evening and a spectacular weekend, good sir. Goodbye. [Phone rings] Justin: Hello? Tim Ferriss: Hi, is this Justin? Justin: It is, hi. Tim Ferriss: Justin, this is Tim Ferriss. How are you, sir? Justin: I\u2019m good, thank you. And how are you? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m good. Where am I finding you at the moment? Justin: I am in Evanston, Illinois. Tim Ferriss: Evanston, Illinois. One of my favorite towns. Justin: Really? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m kidding. I\u2019ve never been. But I\u2019m all yours for the next handful of minutes. I\u2019m getting drunker by the minute, so that should produce increasingly unusable answers, but I am available, so please shoot. Justin: Sure. I just have a question about teaching. So you\u2019ve obviously learned so much and been coached by some really awesome people for all these various skills. I just want to know, are there specific qualities that you look for when you\u2019re trying to look for a teacher in particular? Or are there resources and tactics that you try to find when you seek someone outside of your network? Tim Ferriss: Definitely. I would say there are a handful of things that come to mind immediately. So the first is when assessing teachers, No. 1: have they been able to replicate their own results? That is to underscore the fact that just because people are good at performing or have a performance record that is very impressive does not necessarily mean that they know how to then transmit that knowledge and know-how to other people. Many top performers are extremely good at what they do \u2013 yes, because of some technical or strategic planning, but also because of incredible genetics. It is one of my first hurdles to look for their ability to replicate their results with students. So that\u2019s No. 1. No. 2 would be a question of sorts and that is, are they good at questioning assumptions? Are they good at questioning best practices? Are they willing to experiment with things that might not or should not work based on the literature, for instance? That is a reflection of open-mindedness and general objectivity that I seek in teachers also. Third would be \u2013 and this is something I\u2019ve mentioned before, but \u2013 their willingness to be tough and uncompromising. So their ability and willingness to have tough love and to force people to do what they think they cannot do. Which is extremely important because any novice, certainly even any intermediate coming into a field will probably underestimate their own capabilities. You need someone not just to tell you that you can do more, but to prove to you that you can do more. The way they do that is by forcing you to confront discomfort in practice, generally. Those are a handful of the things that I would say I look for. Justin: Okay, thank you. So you would just do your homework on this teacher, for example, before you try them out or would you just go meet with them, talk to them and see how they do their style to find out whether they have these qualities? Tim Ferriss: I would do both. I would do my homework and then I would ask them questions related to the qualitied that I just described. Those questions could be, how many people have you replicated your own performance with? And if they haven\u2019t, that\u2019s not necessarily a disqualifier, but the answer will tell you a lot. If they say, well, I haven\u2019t replicated my own results with many people because I have the genetic advantage of being designed like a spider for ultra-endurance running, for instance. I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d and weigh 110 pounds and I\u2019m great at dissipating heat. However, I\u2019ve been able to train ten people to do X, Y, and Z. That itself reflects a self-awareness and an awareness that I think contributes to being a very good teacher. So if they are a genetic anomaly, that doesn\u2019t disqualify them, but they need to be aware of that fact. You could ask questions related to really any of the characteristics that I described that would help you to assess whether or not you want to invest the time, energy and/or money into training with someone. So that would be I think my general approach. It\u2019s astonishing, really, to someone who hasn\u2019t attempted what I\u2019m about to describe. How affordable it can be to get extremely good advice via Skype, for instance, from gold medalists or world-class performers in almost any field for very little. This is particularly true in athletics, where you can get generally between $100 or $300 per hour, one-to-one coaching from someone who is one of the best \u2013 meaning top 10 at some point, in the world, in their given field. I mean, that is just a bargain and something worth saving for. So those would be my initial thoughts. Justin: Okay. Well, thank you very much. That was really helpful and yeah, I\u2019ll definitely keep a lot of that in mind when trying to find someone. So, thanks. Tim Ferriss: All right. Well, I appreciate you dropping in your name and phone number. So thanks for the time. Justin: Thanks very much. I love the content. Tim Ferriss: Have a good weekend. Justin: You too. Tim Ferriss: There are also the deconstruction section in The 4-Hour Chef contains a lot of the questions that I tend to ask these types of experts, as well, if that\u2019s of any help. Justin: Okay. Thanks so much. Tim Ferriss: All right. Yeah, have a great weekend. Bye. Justin: You too, bye. [Phone rings] Tim Ferriss: Austin, can you hear me? Austin: Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you now. Tim Ferriss: This is Tim Ferriss calling to harass you. How are you? Austin: Hi, Tim. How are you? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m good. Where are you located at the moment? Austin: I\u2019m in \u2013 like location in the world \u2013 I\u2019m in Puyallup, Washington. It\u2019s kind of near Seattle, Tacoma, Pacific Northwest; up there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, dig it. I like the Pacific Northwest. Lots of rain. I love rain. I\u2019m kidding. Austin: Yeah, there is a lot of rain. Tim Ferriss: So I am at your disposal for the next little while. How can I help or answer questions? I may not do a good job, but I will do my best. Austin: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great. Actually, I do have a question. So over time, I\u2019ve listened to many of your podcasts and I know the different opinions of a lot of those you\u2019ve interviewed, but what would you say your personal view on a college education is? If you were a 19 year old and you were achieving what you wanted to study in, whether it\u2019s in college or not, what do you think you\u2019d want to look towards or what field would you choose to study in? Why would you do that? Tim Ferriss: Good question. Now, for context, are you \u2013 it would look like it from your email address, but are you in college at the moment? Austin: Yeah. I\u2019m at Eastern Washington University. I\u2019m a junior right now and I\u2019m actually looking into economics and [inaudible] in the past week, I was looking into a physics minor too because I actually \u2013 funny, I listened to your podcast with Peter Diamandis and I read his book Abundance and it just totally inspired me. I really want to look into changing the world and doing stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: So short answer is I think economics plus physics is a really smart move. There\u2019s a great article on \u2013 if you just search \u201ccareer advice\u201d and \u201cScott Adams,\u201d he\u2019s the creator of Dilbert. It\u2019s a fantastic piece that\u2019s actually been echoed and referenced by Marc Andreessen, for instance, who is a pioneer in every sense of the possible word. If you look at his technological innovations \u2013 Mosaic, his investment practices and Andreessen Horowitz, which he\u2019s cofounded and helped build, the combination of those degrees gives you more than the sum of its parts, if that makes sense. So first of all, I would say that a college education makes sense. Malcolm Gladwell has talked about this is our conversation that we had on the podcast. It makes sense if you know how to utilize it properly. In other words, I think that a college education or an MBA or anything like that, any advanced degree, makes sense in two cases: (a) if you go to a top-rated \u2013 and that\u2019s, of course, a whole different hornets\u2019 nest to dig into \u2013 but a top-rated university, or (b) if you develop a generalized skillset that allows you to succeed in the world and on top of that, have people who, at 1:00 in the morning, will stimulate and challenge you. That\u2019s it, right? So I am a personal proponent of a college education because of several things. One of which is a survivorship bias that I think is dangerous when you look at those who romanticize lack of any college education. So drop out of college, become a billionaire like Marc \u2013 not Marc, excuse me. But Zuckerberg, for instance. The danger there is similar to the danger if you look at say at Barron\u2019s magazine and read about the mutual funds who offer X, Y, and Z returns and have a fantastic track record. The mutual funds who have failed don\u2019t have the money to advertise, nor do they want to advertise so they don\u2019t. Therefore, you\u2019re only seeing a very small percentage of the total mutual funds who, through skill or in many cases luck, have been able to beat the market for X number of years. Similarly, if you\u2019re only looking at the magazine covers, you\u2019re only reading about the handful of people who have dropped out, usually of a place like Harvard or Princeton or Stanford or something like that, where they can always go back, who have beaten the odds and built a multi-billion-dollar company. That is not the norm. I think that having a college degree as a safety net is, in many cases, an extremely intelligent thing. I certainly feel that way for myself and I feel that way for many people. 90+ percent of the people out there. If you think you\u2019re Mark Zuckerberg, chances are you are not. You have never met him. You just do not understand the delta between where you are and where that person is. Now, you could be, but chances are you\u2019re not. So I think having college education and a degree is extremely important and valuable in today\u2019s economy, as it exists in the United States. In terms of majors and so on, we kind of hit this earlier, but I think the combination of a major and a minor that is unusual is very interesting. So having a hard science element as one of those two increases your viability as a candidate, at least in high-tech start-ups. So if that is one of your goals, if you have a micro and macro-economic, basic set of knowledge from a major and then a minor in physics, that shows (a) a familiarity with and a comfort with numbers, and (b) a comfort with a very uncompromising hard science known as physics, which includes a lot of mathematics. So that is a huge advantage, I think, over people who come to the table with just one major. On top of that, I would say anything you can do, and this could be extra-curricular or it could be in the university itself, to improve your ability to communicate really puts whatever you\u2019ve done on steroids. That\u2019s a very clich\u00e9d expression, but I know a lot about steroids and they can be really effective in legal and competent context. So I think I\u2019ve probably had too much gin and you shouldn\u2019t do steroids, by the way, that would be terrible for your longevity in life and all these other good things. But I digress. So what I\u2019m saying, and there\u2019s someone sitting about 15 feet away from me shaking her head right now. But I\u2019ve had a lot of gin. That\u2019s the whole point of this fucking drunk dial thing. So I would say that if you can \u2013 so let me take a step back. A lot of engineers, a lot of people who are quantitatively comfortable believe that logical arguments win the day. If you can provide a highly logical, if (a), then (b), therefore (c), you will win the contract. You will get the job. You will fill-in-the-blank. That is just not the case. You need to be able to communicate in both a rational and also emotionally compelling way. If you can add the ability to communicate clearly, whether that\u2019s verbally and/or ideally, written, that will give you a huge advantage over at least 50 percent of the people who are competing for a similar slot. So those would be my initial thoughts. But as far as a liberal arts undergraduate degree is concerned, I really feel like you should just study what interests you most. I was initially a neuroscience, or I should say psychology major with an emphasis in neuroscience, and then an East Asian studies degree. That at first glance would seem to have nothing to do with what I did later, but you have your entire life to be a fucking adult. I would explore what interests you during college. It\u2019s an incredible, golden opportunity and a window that is very brief to develop yourself, not as an eligible candidate for the job market, but as a well-rounded human being. I know that probably sounds hokey. It might sound clich\u00e9d. Austin: Not at all. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve had a fair amount of gin. But most people spend the remainder of their life after graduating from college trying to reestablish the quality of life and carefree sentiment that they had while they were in college. So I would encourage you to study what most interests you. But if your predilection is already towards economics plus physics, that\u2019s a fucking killer combo, so I would stick with that. Austin: That\u2019s great to hear, yeah. Actually, I can\u2019t remember. Probably when I was in about ninth grade or tenth grade, actually The 4-Hour Workweek \u2013 my Dad introduced me to it and I read it and it really changed the course of everything that I lived towards and really just realizing that I can do what I want in life and really freedom is a real possibility and financial stability and I can achieve that. Not just that, but really doing what you like. So I think actually just recently, like I said, the physics component has come in and like I said, I listen to your podcast and I\u2019m super inspired. I actually started listening to Peter\u2019s podcast because of that and that really shaped the path that I\u2019m on right now. So thank you very much for being so inspiring. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations, man. Well, you sound like you are in a great place. Peter is fantastic, obviously. I mean, every time I meet Peter, I come away thinking, what the fuck am I doing with my life? He\u2019s a very big-scale thinker, which is good because he stretches me and he makes me uncomfortable in all the ways that are the most productive. So I appreciate you listening to the podcast and it sounds like you\u2019re in a great place, man. I would just say keep doing what you\u2019re doing. If economics and physics are the path, then that\u2019s the path. If you compelled to study something that seems useless like classics \u2013 guess what? I know people who\u2019ve made hundreds of millions of dollars who have studied classics. It\u2019s not the end all, be all. Learning early, however, to follow your passion and pay attention to that intuition I think is incredibly valuable beyond any extent to which you can currently imagine. So I would cultivate that. If you neuter that, if you mute that, if you suffocate that, you are in for a world of hurt for a very long period of time. You may feel like you\u2019re gaining in the short-term, but you will really suffer in the long-term. I would just say chase what excites you and honestly the rest will generally take care of itself. If you chase what excites you, you\u2019re going to be good at what you pursue. Austin: That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard over and over. Tim Ferriss: If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to be mediocre because you just will not have the endurance the horsepower to push through the inevitable obstacles that\u2019ll turn up. So that would be my thought. Yeah, man. Crush it. I\u2019ve got dozens of start-ups who will probably hire you. So keep plugging along. Austin: Perfect. Thank you so much for your input and for your books and everything. I can\u2019t wait for the next book to come out. I\u2019m going to pre-order that on Amazon and get that shipped here and everything. Thank you so much. Tim Ferriss: Of course, man. I appreciate you reading and yeah, Tools of Titans will be fun. I can say this because I didn\u2019t actually write most of it. It\u2019s related to the learnings and lessons from other people, but yeah, it\u2019s a fun read. I think you\u2019ll dig it. So I will let you go, but have a great weekend. I appreciate you dropping in your name and your phone number. Austin: Perfect, thank you. Thank you so much for the call and for everything. Tim Ferriss: All right, man. Take it easy, bye. Austin: You too, bye. [Phone rings] Eric: Hello? Tim Ferriss: Eric, this is Tim. Eric: Hey, Tim. Tim Ferriss: How art thou? Eric: Good, how are you? Tim Ferriss: Oh, I\u2019m great. I\u2019m fantastic. Sitting at my acacia wood table, if that means anything to anyone. I think actually, giraffe eat acacia, for what that\u2019s worth. Let\u2019s see here. So where \u2013 actually, you seem like you might be in New York, but I\u2019m not sure, based on the number. Where are you? Eric: I\u2019m in New York City, yeah. Tim Ferriss: One of the best towns on earth. It\u2019s a good spot. Eric: Yeah, lived here all my life. Tim Ferriss: Say again? Eric: I said I\u2019ve lived here all my life. Tim Ferriss: Oh, no kidding? Born and raised? Eric: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s a good town. Hey, man. I was born out on Strong Island. Although most New Yorkers don\u2019t count that as New York. It\u2019s kind of like the red-headed stepchild of New York State. Which is okay. Eric: Just a little bit. Yeah, it gets kind of a bad rep. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you know. Rat tails and all that. But that\u2019s okay. So how can I be of service? I\u2019m happy to answer any questions or attempt to and bumble, as I think is more likely at this point in my blood alcohol content surge, but fire away. Eric: Okay. So I\u2019ve actually been considering starting my own podcast, where I interview people in my field. So seeing how you have your podcast and you\u2019ve had what now? Two years almost of experience doing it? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Eric: I would love some advice on that. My background is in software development and security and what I really want to do \u2013 what gets me really jazzed is interviewing people in my people who have done exceptional things and who would have great stories to tell and research they\u2019ve done or really cool projects they started. The problem is, I don\u2019t really have a recognizable name yet in my field. So what I\u2019m wondering is, how would you recommend I get experts\u2019 attention in my field and how might I convince them to come on to my show? Tim Ferriss: Start small and roll your way up. So you should get whoever you can get and then level up one degree. Recruit and once you\u2019ve done that, level up one degree. Recruit and rinse and repeat. It is the approach that I took and it is the approach that you generally should take. There was a presentation by Matt Cutts of Google, or at least at the time of Google, who talked about the Katamari principle or it might have been Katamari Damacy \u2013 I think it\u2019s a Japanese video game. In any case, the basic idea is that whether it\u2019s with a blog or podcast, you start with a very niche focus. In this video game, Katamari Damacy I think it is, you have sort of a lint ball that you roll up and you accumulate larger things and then eventually you get to a point where you\u2019re actually rolling up planets and galaxies and so on. Eric: Oh yeah. I\u2019ve played this game actually. It sounds really familiar. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, you know what I\u2019m talking about. Eric: Back on like PlayStation 1. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. So you start out very niche and that allows you to go after higher caliber people in a narrow field. That would be Step, or I should say Principle 1. On top of that, I would commit to doing a minimum of six episodes or at least recording a minimum of six episodes. There are a few reasons for this. No. 1, the ITN\u2019s algorithm rewards multiple episodes and downloads being received by listeners at the same time. So you\u2019re best served by uploading two or three, at the minimum, episodes for your debut. No. 2 is that whenever I\u2019m considering taking on a new project, for instance podcasting or otherwise, I look for the ways in which \u2013 and I assess for each of the options I might be considering \u2013 the ways in which I can win even if the project fails. So let\u2019s say your podcast does not take off or you don\u2019t like it. You decide, for whatever reason, that you\u2019re going to quit after six episodes. How can you format the podcast, how can you prepare it, how can you work on it in such a way that you develop skills or relationships that persist and accumulate after those six episodes? In other words, if after six you decide to throw in the towel and quit, how can that still be a success? I think this is a very important question. For me, it was eliminating verbal tics, or minimizing them. I\u2019m not done, obviously. Improving my ability to ask questions. Improving my ability to ask follow-up questions. Improving my ability to set silence do the work, as Cal Fussman would say, who has been on the podcast. Not jump in when someone is struggling to answer something. All of those abilities, for me, translate and would have translated even if I had quit after six episodes, which was my personal commitment to improving my ability to do research and interview for book projects. So in that capacity, I could win, develop those skills, even if the podcast were a failure. So I would think very carefully on that and potentially journal on that question. Commit to writing three, freeform, longhand pages first thing at the morning at some point based on that to determine how can this be a success even if it\u2019s a failure to outside eyes? So those would be a few of the things that come to mind offhand when you ask that question. But I\u2019m happy to dig deeper. Eric: Awesome, yeah. No, I think those sound like great starting points for me. I really like the concept of making it a game you can\u2019t lose, right? You\u2019re going to get something out of it and have to decide what those things are going to be in advance. Tim Ferriss: Exactly, yeah. As an engineer, it sounds like you\u2019re an engineer, this is not an alien concept, right? It\u2019s just applied to an audio podcasting arena, but you\u2019re going to be \u2013 given your experience as an engineer, I think better at codifying certain things and determining best practices for certain things, than a lay, non-engineering audience, which I would put myself smack dab in the middle of, unfortunately. I wish I had more engineering and quantitative comfort, but I just do not. So that\u2019s an unfortunate handicap, but I\u2019ve managed to make do. So what other questions do you have about the podcasting? I can answer those pretty directly, I think. Eric: Well, that was my big one. I think when I sit down and try to figure out what the first steps are. I have some loose concepts of what I want to be interviewing people on. I guess naturally the next question would be, how do you choose your questions? Tim Ferriss: Well, let\u2019s tackle that a different way. Give me an example of someone who you would want to interview and let\u2019s start there. Who would you name? Eric: Let\u2019s see \u2013 David Heinemeier Hansson. Tim Ferriss: Ooh, yeah, DHH, Ruby on Rails, sure. Eric: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, very interesting guy. So what would you ask him? If you had five minutes with him, what would the top three questions be? Eric: The first question that comes to mind is, what type of conditions was he in when he developed Ruby on Rails? What really pushed him and motivated him to develop this technology and then open source it? So I\u2019d be really interested in what his main motivator was at that time? Like what was going through his head that allowed him to commit to doing that? It\u2019s a big project, so I\u2019d be really curious about that. Tim Ferriss: What next? Eric: The second one would be, what sort of changes did he go through in his life to go from \u2013 I believe he was working on Basecamp at the time and he kind of changed paths a little bit in what he was doing. He still is involved with that, but what changes did he go through that were unexpected? What actually was going on? I guess talking a little bit about his story. I\u2019d want to know more about his story. So the first one would be for me like a motivator. What was his drive? I think that can be really important to look at in individuals that excel and are motivated to do that and go outside of their comfort zone. The second one would be what was his story? What was changing in his life? His narrative about that would be really interesting. Tim Ferriss: So I would suggest a complementary approach, which would be identify what he is most interested or excited to talk about and explore that first. Because that will put him at ease, allow him to tell a story that he likes to tell and open the gates for the other things. I believe that in interviewing, being different at least for the first 10 to 15 minutes is more important than being better, if that makes sense. So if you think to yourself, I would like to ask the following three questions. The follow-up that you should ask yourself is, has he been asked this question more than ten times? If the answer is yes, I would not start with that. For instance, I know that \u2013 and I\u2019m drunk enough that I\u2019m going to get the details wrong here, but you can Google it and figure it out \u2013 he is very involved or has been historically involved with race car driving. I think he placed second place in the Le Mans race several years ago. It could\u2019ve been five years ago, I don\u2019t know the exact timeline. That may be something that he is very seldom asked about that he would be eager to or excited to talk about. Start with that. Given that opportunity to talk about something that he is interested in that very few people ask him about, that would then open the gate to questions that are perhaps more normal or standard. Does that make sense? Eric: Yeah, that makes sense to me. Tim Ferriss: If you listen to, for instance, my interview with Edward Norton, we talked about surfing first. That is a direct corollary to what I\u2019m suggesting. Because we were sitting on Malibu pier, having lunch, drinking coffee, looking out at the surfing lineup and Edward is a very dedicated surfer, so we talked about that first. That was effectively the one to three rounds of limbering up, much like a boxing or Thai boxing match within which we were able to just relax into answers that he could then deliver very honestly and sincerely. But if you start with questions that he\u2019s been asked before, for instance, about Ruby on Rails, you\u2019re going to be one of a hundred other people who have done the same and he\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t want to speak for DHH \u2013 David, it\u2019s been a couple of years, but obviously I\u2019m a big fan of what he has done and what he does \u2013 but he will probably, just as I would do, go onto auto pilot, right? So you want to be different before you are simply incrementally better is my suggestion in this particular case. I\u2019ll add an unsolicited piece of feedback, since I\u2019m still sipping gin, gin and juice. Gin and juice, would you say that? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m looking at my cohort I shall not name at this moment. It\u2019s not really gin and juice. Yeah, I\u2019m not really Snoop Dogg. Not quite Snoop Dogg. He\u2019s got a leg up on me. Sorry, bear with me here. I\u2019m enjoying my own drunken revelry. Bear with me. Eric: No worries. You\u2019re still the most coherent drunk call that I\u2019ve ever heard. Tim Ferriss: What I was going to say is that you, for hardware, I would suggest a few things, and also logistics. No. 1 is do it via Skype or via Zencastr or some telephonic means versus in person. In person is more difficult to do for podcast. The likelihood of you screwing something up technically or from a preparatory standpoint is much higher. So I would use, in my case, Skype, as I am right now. I am using Skype and Ecamm call recorder. Although it\u2019s not necessarily right now, for many of my podcast guests, I will have Evernote open with notes and questions, etc. so that I am extremely prepared and able to respond to any twist in the conversation that might come up. I would encourage you to start with some type of phoner, per se, because your likelihood of success is much higher. If you\u2019re looking for, as I\u2019m using right now, a great bang-for-the-buck microphone, since I heard you ask. You didn\u2019t ask, I\u2019m just joking. But this is an ATR2100 Audio-Technica mic. ATR2100. That is probably $80.00, and it, for most folks, will do as good a job as the Heil PR-40, I think it\u2019s called, which is a $500.00 mic. This one costs $80.00 on Amazon. So this is what I use. Plus Apple earbuds to remove echo. I don\u2019t know why this works, but I do that it works. To avoid any type of echoing effect or to minimize it, ear buds of some type are a very wise investment. Eric: Awesome. That\u2019s good to know. I haven\u2019t really dived into looking for hardware yet. So that\u2019s good to know what your pick is. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, ATR2100. I use this for like 50 percent of my interviews. It\u2019s cheap, relatively speaking, not too expensive. I would give it a go. So that is it, my friend. I\u2019m going to bounce, but hopefully that is valuable in some capacity. Eric: Yeah, it definitely was. Thank you so much, Tim. Tim Ferriss: All right. Have a good weekend. Eric: You too. Tim Ferriss: Bye. [Phone rings] Tim Ferriss: Hey, hey, hey. It\u2019s Tim Ferris. Who\u2019s this? Vin: This is Vin Thomas. Tim Ferriss: Vin Thomas. How the hell are you? Are you in the Pacific Northwest? It would seem that way? Vin: Yeah, I\u2019m in Oregon. Tim Ferriss: Good man. God damn, Oregonians are just owning this evening. Well, I am at your disposal, sir. How can I help? Any questions? Any comments? How may I be of assistance? Vin: Man, you\u2019ve already been a ton of assistance to me. I started my [inaudible] business right after [inaudible] The 4-Hour Workweek, so I was huge and now I own a small design company, started another company and I really attribute a lot of \u2013 I think back then what I learned from The 4-Hour Workweek, so I just appreciate that, man. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Well, good work. Congratulations. Vin: So let me see. Here\u2019s what I want to do. I want to stop working as much and make more money. You\u2019re kind of the king of that? Tim Ferriss: Well, I can try. I\u2019ve had a couple of gin tonics, so we will see how lucid my answers will be. But yes, I can do my best. I\u2019ll need a more specific question, but yes, I can take a stab at it. Vin: Okay, so I have a design company. We work mostly with start-ups and early-stage companies. We just kind of reinvent the wheel every single time we approach a project and it just requires a lot of serious, hands-on hours. I\u2019ve just been thinking through how can we streamline this process? How can we make it easier? I have two great developers who work for me who do an amazing job, but again, they have to absolutely hands-on the whole time. We put a lot of hours in each project. I know there\u2019s a better way to do it. Tim Ferriss: What are your off-the-cuff thoughts on how to improve the process? What have you brainstormed so far? Vin: Well, so I mean, a couple thoughts is hey, let\u2019s templatize a lot of this stuff. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, let\u2019s templatize a lot of it. Maybe we can charge less per project, but it would take us significantly less time if we could do some of that. We basically have these modules that we could piece together these websites. We do a lot of marketing sites. Really, there\u2019s a lot of the same stuff: staff page, about page, tour, features, etc. A lot of it is essentially the same, but we build it from scratch every single time, so that\u2019s something I think could help us. But even beyond that, I think would could productize the service even more than that. Maybe us with an entirely different company. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So the first thought is you have clients respond in a templatized fashion. Meaning, they\u2019re filling out some type of questionnaire or a series of questions that will allow you to get 70, 80 percent of the work done without a lot of conference calls and other types of bandwidth-consuming activities. The other option is to say that we offer A, B, and C and that is it, right? In other words, to limit the scope of your operation so you specialize in one, two, or three things that you position yourself as being best at and you are then able to very sell yourself based on those strengths but nothing else. I think those are a handful of approaches that come to mind offhand. Reading probably The E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber would be a good idea. Vin: Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: What are the current aspects of your business? If you had to identify the 20 percent of activities that are creating 80 percent of your headache at the moment, what would those be? Vin: I\u2019m a designer so that\u2019s my role in the company. I am the owner and the designer. I enjoy that piece of the project. What I don\u2019t enjoy as much is writing proposals, putting in however many hours of discovery before we can even kick off a project. I understand that\u2019s part of what goes into being a good UI/UX designer, but man, some of that, the administrative stuff kills me. I think the idea of templatizing, gathering that content could probably help. I guess I wonder for our current clientele if they would go for that. I think we might even have to branch off into either a subsection of our current business or even create a new business that would be more prone to that form of templatized approach. Tim Ferriss: I think it\u2019s an experiment worth running. Or a hypothesis worth disproving in the sense that it\u2019s something you could run for a handful of weeks to gather data and then make a more informed decision. So it doesn\u2019t have to be an all or nothing bet. It doesn\u2019t have to be a bet-the-farm-type decision. In this case, where you can alternatively and simply, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m throwing this up, but split the traffic to your website 50/50. 50 is going to where it\u2019s always gone, 50 is going to some type of survey or templatized questionnaire, whereby you gather the most critical data you need in ten questions or fewer, and then you review the data accordingly. So that would be my first knee-jerk response. Vin: The level of clients that come to us now would be so different than the level of client that would want a templatized service, right? And so I don\u2019t know if that would work. Because people don\u2019t find us through SEO. They find us because someone told them about us. I almost feel like that might be a weird experience for someone if they came directly expecting \u2013 we almost bill ourselves as your outsourced in-house design team. We\u2019re there to handhold your project, hand hold it throughout the whole process. So thinking back to The 4-Hour Workweek, do I start running experiments with TPC or Ad Words to see if people even want to buy this. Do I start a new, almost like a phony business, like whip something up in a weekend to see if people are going to bite? Tim Ferriss: Well, I would say that at the top of the funnel, it is important to be aware of conflicting objectives, right? So if you have an objective to be the bespoke customized solution for people who expect handholding from A to Z, yet on the other hand you have the objective of minimizing the amount of time that you personally have to allocate to each client, you may have conflicting objectives. Vin: Yeah, I agree. Tim Ferriss: Right? So in that case, no amount of massaging or fine-tuning in surgery is going to fix two primary objectives that conflict. To that extent, I would say that it is probably worth testing for two to four weeks how people respond to a templatized approach. Because right now you have a set of assumptions, as we always do, every one of us myself included, have assumptions of how counterparts A, B, or C are going to respond to D, E, and F that I\u2019m going to put out in the world. You just don\u2019t know at the end of the day. So I would consider testing using Unbounce or Leadpages or another service or an in-house programming team. 50 percent of your traffic allocated to a templatized approach. In fact, what you may find is that people disqualify or qualify themselves in such a way that allows you and them to spare an incredible amount of man hours because they\u2019ve either disqualified or qualified themselves in a much more efficient process. So I would say that\u2019s probably how I would approach it is really as from the get go, we do not know, therefore we must test. We\u2019re going to take two to four weeks to gather the data and then reassess what our results and objectives and process should be. Vin: Sure, that\u2019s a great idea. We have a new website that\u2019s about to launch \u2013 our personal website \u2013 so that would be something we could easily build in. We could optimize or do something like that to assess what people like. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, exactly. Vin: That\u2019s a good suggestion. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Optimizely is a great suggestion. I\u2019ve used them before as well. I\u2019ll give you a current example for myself. I am looking at developing a new site for Tools of Titans, my book that launches on December 6. It\u2019s available for \u2013 Vin: I\u2019m looking forward to it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019s available for presale \u2013 wow, I am slurring like a motherfucker right now. It\u2019s available for presale on Amazon, but I am looking at the conversion effectiveness of fourhourbody.com (all spelled out) versus fourhourchef.com. Fourhourbody is much simpler. Designed by the same firm. They\u2019re both by the same company. Digital Telepathy in this case. The fourhourchef is, I would say, more intricate, more complicated. Before I design the Tools of Titans website, I am determining which has converted most effectively. There may be a number of tests that I have to run before we have a statistically significant number or set of data to work with to determine what the next step is for the design of toolsoftitans.com. But that is going to come, right? It\u2019s not that dissimilar from what you\u2019re running through right now. I will probably end up split testing, at the very least, sort of A/B testing, two versions of the website. It may be more than that. I will look at, very concretely, which version of that website is resulting in the highest percentage per mil \u2013 right, of every thousand people who visit \u2013 what is producing the highest percentage of people who click on the button that I have determined is the most valuable click? That could be a button to Barnesandnoble.com. It could be a button to Amazon.com. It could be a button, in your case, to ask for a quote. It could be any number of things. But determining what that most valuable click is and then testing multiple versions for it, particularly over a timespan of two to four weeks, is a very reasonable and non-threatening time period within which you can assess what is working and what isn\u2019t. Ultimately, when you look at \u2013 let\u2019s just say the people I\u2019ve had on the podcast, people who\u2019ve made hundreds of millions or billions of dollars \u2013 the one commonality or one of the few commonalities that they have is they are constantly testing their own assumptions. They\u2019re asking themselves, how do I know what I think is best? The answer is, you very seldom know. You have to look at the numbers. So that would be my very long-winded recommendation I think, at this point. Question for you, is Vin your entire first name or is that short for something else? I\u2019ve wondered this for a long time. Vin: So I go by Vin, I\u2019ve gone by Vin since I was a teenager. But when I was younger, people would call me Kev, and I hated that. People would say, \u201cHey, Kev.\u201d I\u2019d say \u201cVin.\u201d Because my name was Kevin, right? So then it just became Vin. Tim Ferriss: I like it. Vin: I don\u2019t think [inaudible]. I don\u2019t think most people who go by Vin, not that there\u2019s a ton of them, are really named Kevin. There you have it. Tim Ferriss: I like it, all right, cool. That\u2019s good to know. All right, man. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m going to get a hop on things. Have a great weekend. Good luck. Vin: I appreciate it. Thanks, Tim. Tim Ferriss: All right, man. Take it easy. Vin: Okay, man. Bye. Tim Ferriss: Bye. [Phone rings] Ian: I\u2019m not available right now, but leave me your name and number and a detailed message and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. Hope to talk to you soon. Bye now. Tim Ferriss: Ian, what happened? This is Tim Ferriss. I was hoping to wrap up with someone from South Dakota but alas, that is not to be. So on to the next number, I suppose. Have a glorious weekend. [Phone rings] Tim Ferriss: Chris, this is Tim Ferriss calling. How are you? Chris: Good. Tim, how are you? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m great, I\u2019m great. You are potentially the final conversation in my little drunk dialing escapade. Chris: The final conversation means you\u2019ve gotten pretty drunk, Tim, huh? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d say I\u2019m well above the threshold, yes. Where are you at the moment? Where is 520? Chris: 520 is Tucson, Arizona. Tim Ferriss: Oh, nice. Arizona. The land of extreme heat and extreme air conditioning. Chris: Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s actually pretty good weather out here tonight. Tim Ferriss: Nice. So I am all yours desponible for any questions or comments that you might have, so fire away. I\u2019m all yours. Chris: Currently, I\u2019m wondering about financial freedom. A couple months ago, me and my girlfriend broke up because I felt like the drag of trying to \u2013 the rat race, I guess? Just kind of not worth it. She was very much in that realm and I found a place where I didn\u2019t really agree with it. I think that\u2019s kind of a place you\u2019ve been. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I\u2019ve been there before. Chris: I\u2019m trying to wonder how to take the steps forward in being able to be free of the whole corporate financial realm. I don\u2019t exactly the way to put it to make more sense, but pressure I guess. The pressure of the 401(k), the retirement, the big house, fancy car kind of stuff. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I think the first thought that comes to mind is really looking at your target monthly income and dissecting what the goal is in more precise terms. So if you go to fourhourworkweek.com/tmi, that will give you some calculators and whatnot that you can use. But I think the important or one of the important aspects is beginning within mind. In this case, defining what your objective is first and foremost. Without that, it will be very difficult for you to calibrate and direct yourself in the right direction. So I would begin with at least tentatively, it doesn\u2019t need to be a perfect or permanent decision, but deciding what your ideal lifestyle looks like in terms of how you spend your time, how you spend your resources, before you begin making any further decisions. So that would be Step 1. Really identifying what you want to have, what you want to do, what you want to be, over the next one to three years will provide you with at least an objective, something in the crosshairs to aim at while you make decisions. So that would be Step 1 is determining your target monthly income based on what you want to have, what you want to do, what you want to be, in very concrete terms. Beyond that, I would really turn the question around and ask you what you have found most helpful to date I suppose would be my approach. Chris: It was a couple years ago. I work for a pharmaceutical company and so I actually have a lot of time at work to listen to podcasts. A couple years ago, I found you and Joe Rogan. I developed a real passion for it. Talk radio, podcast kind of stuff. More than I\u2019ve really had a passion for anything. I would love to get in that type of realm, but it\u2019s kind of a hard area to crack without having sort of niche to fall into. So the average guy can\u2019t really start a podcast that people would actually listen to. Do you know what I mean? Tim Ferriss: Well, yeah. I agree that in the beginning no one is going to listen. Which is true for 99 out of 100 people who start podcasts. Chris: And podcasts are getting pretty popular. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they do. But I would say that it\u2019s not too late to \u2013 whether it is start a podcast, start a blog, start a newsletter, fill in the blank. I think the most important component of that or checkbox is identifying what you would be personally excited to do on a consistent basis because if you choose a podcast because it seems popular at the moment but you\u2019re not, in fact, excited about doing it, you\u2019re going to quit after the first few episodes. There\u2019s just no two ways about it. So I really think that following your excitement and dedication to a particular medium is more than choosing what is the medium du jour at that point in time, if that makes any sense. Chris: Yeah, absolutely. That was kind of my motivation. I was in a long-term relationship and it just really didn\u2019t make sense in terms of my goals and that was my thing is I needed to follow what motivated me and podcasts and radio is that. So I don\u2019t know what the first step is. You have a great book but it\u2019s vague on first steps, you know. Where do I jump off from here, you know? Tim Ferriss: Well, as it relates to podcasting specifically, that\u2019s a relatively new medium or industry compared to the 2007 publication date of The 4-Hour Workweek. So first steps there are record six episodes and during that period of time determine, much like Scott Adams in my podcast with him, how you can make it a systems objective, as opposed to a goal-oriented objective. Meaning what can you learn through those six episodes of experimentation, even if your podcast ends up being listened to by no one? When you think in those terms, you will cumulatively \u2013 Chris: Learn from experience. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. Through the snowball effect of aiming for learning and network, i.e., what do I learn, who do I meet, who do I get to know? Develop a combination of factors that lead to success eventually, as opposed to a binary pass or fail. So that would be my suggestion is thinking very carefully about if I try X for six episodes, if I try Y for two months, how can I ensure this is a win over time, as opposed to a binary pass or fail? I think that\u2019s very important, so that\u2019s how I would approach all of this. Chris: Makes a lot of sense, yeah. I guess the first step in jumping into anything is having the courage to jump into it, I guess. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s really a matter of ready, fire, aim, as opposed to ready, aim, fire. You kind of have to jump off the diving board and then figure out how you\u2019re going to end up headfirst diving into the water on the way down. That isn\u2019t to say you should be haphazard, but if you only operate from a place of perfect information and complete information, you\u2019re never going to act at all. This is where I think you can learn a lot from studying military operations is how to operate and make decisions from a place of incomplete information. So I would say that in the case of podcasting at least, you need to get started before you can figure out 90% of the elements involved and commit to doing a minimum of say six episodes and that could vary from person to person, but in my case it was six episodes, so that you can maximize your learning curve in such a way that even if the podcast doesn\u2019t take, if people don\u2019t listen to it, you still gain far more from the experience than you give up in terms of time and resources. Chris: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Tim Ferriss: All right, man. Well, I tell you what. I\u2019ve got to get going. I think I\u2019m starting to wane on the side of alcohol-infused energy. Chris: Can I catch you for another 15 minutes to ask you some questions? Tim Ferriss: 15 minutes? Maybe not. But I can certainly give you a shout for a couple more minutes. Go for it. Chris: Okay, so you were a very successful young man, are you still dating the same girl you\u2019ve been dating? Tim Ferriss: I am not dating the same girl that I\u2019ve been dating for five years or so. I am in a new relationship. So that is that. Next question? Chris: What do you find difficult about dating in your way of life? Tim Ferriss: What do I find difficult about dating in my way of life? Well \u2013 Chris: In way of life, I mean that you\u2019re not a selfish person, but you have very personal goals and it\u2019s not in the sense of having a family \u2013 well, maybe it is, but you don\u2019t have relationship goals. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I mean, I would say that \u2013 Chris: I don\u2019t mean to put words in your mouth. Tim Ferriss: No, it\u2019s fine. I think that it comes down to finding someone who is complete in and of themselves. In other words, someone who is low maintenance insomuch as they are comfortable in their own skin and they aren\u2019t desperate for finding someone else to make them a complete human being. I think that you need to \u2013 or at least I need to \u2013 be with someone, spend time with someone, whether that is a friend or a girlfriend, for that matter, who I respect and admire in some capacity because if you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s really a short-term bet that it\u2019s going to ultimately, I think, self-implode in the long-term. Chris: Do you think monogamy in the sense of human capability is rational? Tim Ferriss: Do I think monogamy is rational? I think that, as one of my very high-performing, close friends put it, who is a male, if you think about monogamy as a lifelong commitment, you will just end up slitting your wrists. I think you should take it one day at a time. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a decision you necessarily have to make now or tomorrow or in the next three months. I think that it\u2019s something that you can revisit \u2013 Chris: In different scenarios. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 when needed in different scenarios. I mean, I happen to think that monogamy is very hard for most human beings, based on what I\u2019ve seen. But am I going to force myself to be non-monogamous when I\u2019m perfectly content? No, I\u2019m not. Because it adds complexity to a life that is already sufficiently complex. Chris: Having very apparent and first-hand values with someone would they kind of agree with this? It\u2019s so hard to find but so important. People kind of jump into stuff without really knowing anyone they jump into. Does that make sense? Tim Ferriss: It makes sense. I also think that satisfaction or frustration is very related to setting expectations up front. So if you have spoken to someone up front about the fact that you are in a place that in whatever capacity necessitates or leads you to feel that you are unsure of monogamy A, B, C, D, or E, whatever it might be. As long as communicate that, you are being a fair player on the chessboard that relates to that relationship. Where people get themselves into particular trouble is they want to save that confession for a point where it\u2019s a dollar late and a dime too short and I think that is a precarious position to put yourself and your partner into. So if you set the expectations up front, it doesn\u2019t mean that you will avoid all discomfort, but it puts you in a position where you can at least more rationally discuss things. If you try to keep your darker side or less socially acceptable impulses in the shadows until the 11th hour, when you need to talk about it, then you\u2019re far more likely to have incredible difficulties and pain. That\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m a relationship master. Look, I mean, I\u2019ve fucked up my fair number of relationships, as we all have. But I do think that reading a book like Lying by Sam Harris \u2013 a very short read \u2013 is very valuable for relationships of all types, including intimate ones for minimizing undue pain and suffering. Chris: We\u2019re also, like a lot of your listeners, actually all of your listeners, aren\u2019t Tim Ferriss either. I mean, you have your demons just as much as we do, but you\u2019re still Tim Fucking Ferriss. Tim Ferriss: I think people overestimate what being Tim Ferriss means. I have as many demons that I am battling as anyone else. It\u2019s important to realize that you may only be seeing the highlight reel of Tim Ferriss. If you\u2019re watching the movie trailer of Tim Ferriss\u2019 life, you\u2019re going to be like, \u201cFuck, that\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s fantastic. I really want to be Tim Ferriss.\u201d But then you might watch the movie and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cI\u2019ll give that a fucking 67 on Rotten Tomatoes. I\u2019m not up for that entire ride. I think that half of it really doesn\u2019t apply to me.\u201d So it\u2019s important to realize that it\u2019s easy to put other people on a pedestal but everyone is Swiss cheese. We all have our holes. I am not exempt from that in any capacity. Chris: I think you do really well with your blog posts, where I think maybe your initial one where you said, \u201cI\u2019m not perfect. I masturbated last Tuesday to whatever, and I\u2019m this person who has all the same mistakes that everyone else does. I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m trying to optimize my life. I\u2019m trying to live the same \u2013 I\u2019m trying to be the best person that everyone else is trying to do,\u201d but you\u2019re doing it in a very systematic way, which is why I think you have so many people looking up to you. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re all, I think, fighting a lot of the same battles. I think that was the \u201cproductivity hacks for the neurotic, crazy and manic-depressive like me,\u201d I think that was the blog post. I think it\u2019s important, as one of my podcast guests, Sophia Amoruso said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so impressed.\u201d Look, I\u2019ve put in a lot of thought and a lot of good work into trying to improve myself and help others, but don\u2019t be so impressed. No one knew who the hell I was before 2007. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t do ten times more than I can if you apply yourself and approach it in a systematic way. Look, at the end of the day, we\u2019re all dust and 100 years from now, I\u2019ll be very surprised if anyone fucking remembers who I am, if we\u2019re not all incinerated from some type of climate change. But I think, at least for me, the objective is be a force for good. Don\u2019t procrastinate, don\u2019t bitch and moan on fucking Twitter 24/7. Try to actually put a foot forth. Stick your neck out, risk getting criticized, and improve things because criticizing or vilifying one group by the way is not the same as helping every other group who might or may not need help, is a risky business. If you actually want to improve the world, you are an exception. I should actually take a step back and say, if you stick your neck out and try to improve the world, you are an exception. Most of the people in the world are happy to sit on the sidelines and criticize and be a peanut gallery and bullshit and throw stones, but if you want to be in the arena, the one guarantee is you\u2019re going to get a lot of black eyes and you\u2019re going to get a lot of bloody knees and very few people are going to fucking thank you for it. That is a mantle that you choose to accept or you don\u2019t, but if you do, No. 1, kudos to you. Congratulations and thank you. No. 2, don\u2019t expect everybody to pat you on the fucking back. You\u2019re going to get a lot of shit. That is just part and parcel of the whole arrangement unfortunately. But that is as true now as it was 2,000 years ago in the age of Seneca and Marcus Aurelias and everybody else. Human nature doesn\u2019t change a whole lot. So that would be I suppose my sum up of the whole situation. Chris: Agreed. I [inaudible]. Even going back to Socrates. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It doesn\u2019t change all too much. Chris: So I think serial podcast listeners feel that podcasts you listen to every single day, they look at you guys as friends. So I listen to you every day and you give me advice, same with Joe Rogan or any of the other people that I listen to. We don\u2019t have a conversation, but I listen to it and I see them as friends. Then when you run into these people in real life, they look at you as one of their good friends who has helped them through hard situations, who is a person in their groom party when they get married. What is that like when you run into those people? When they look at you so on a \u2013 not necessarily a pedestal, but they look at you as like a family member and you see them as a total stranger who you have no relationship to. Is that strange? Is that nice? Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s both. It\u2019s strange and nice and it\u2019s usually flattering. I\u2019m not immune to being on the other side of the equation, in the sense that, for instance, in Neil Gaiman, I idolize in a lot of ways the writer, fiction writer primarily, and I\u2019ve met him once, sure. But he doesn\u2019t know me. When I met him, because I\u2019d heard his voice for dozens of hours, I\u2019m sure it was fucking weird and creepy on some level because I had such a level of familiarity with him, yet he had none with me necessarily. That imbalance is something I\u2019ve become more comfortable with when I meet someone who has listened to my podcast for dozens of hours or hundreds of hours. I am more ready to accept that and welcome it than I might have been a few years ago, because it is a little odd to have such a relationship where one person has 100 percent of the information and the other person has 1 or 2 percent of the information, at best. It is a little odd but that doesn\u2019t make it bad; odd doesn\u2019t equal bad. For me, I\u2019ve just taken that as an opportunity when I talk to people, whether it\u2019s you or someone else, to try to explore more of what they\u2019ve experienced so that I can correct that imbalance of information, if that makes any sense. But it\u2019s not a bad thing. Of all the problems to have in the world, this is a good problem to have. So I certainly try not to complain. Chris: I think with any conversation, it\u2019s tough to get to the core of someone, but when you meet someone who\u2019s listened to you for so many years, you\u2019ve already cut to the core then. So if you really want to talk to them, they\u2019re willing to spill their guts to you or anyone, you know what I mean? So you\u2019ve already cut through a lot of that core with a lot of people who listen to you for so many years. That\u2019s really cool. Tim Ferriss: Well, I appreciate that. On top of that, when people sometimes approach me \u2013 let\u2019s say they meet me at a book signing or something like that and they say, \u201cWell, I know we don\u2019t know each other but,\u201d and I want to say, \u201cIf you\u2019ve listened to dozens or 100+ of my podcast, you actually do know me pretty well. Chris: Yeah, you\u2019re very good at that. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not an illusion. You really have spent a lot of time with me. You actually know me extremely well. I mean, better than some people who consider themselves my close friends. So that\u2019s perhaps an unusual side effect, but a beneficial one and I think it\u2019s an interesting one at the very least, of this type of new media relationship. You can know someone better that some of their close friends know them by virtue of the fact of being exposed to them for dozens or hundreds of hours. So it\u2019s something that I try to look at as an incredible opportunity, as opposed to anything strange. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive. You can have incredibly interesting, incredible opportunities that are simultaneously somewhat odd and very strange. That\u2019s what I would say. Chris: Absolutely. I think that was my love of podcasts is that a lot of people just have real conversations. Then when I got out and talk to my friends and everyone\u2019s so hesitant \u2013 or talking to co-workers, everyone has a face they want to put out. It\u2019s hard. Listening to podcasts and people actually have real conversations. When you have fake ones, it just doesn\u2019t matter as much. It\u2019s hard to break through strangers or friends when everyone has their guard up. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, well, you know, I think that podcasters you have to realize at a certain point are also professionals. So it\u2019s not fair to hold strangers to the same standard where in Japanese, for instance, or in Japan, both, they talk about ho ne, which is how you behave, your core of who you are, versus ta tai mai. Ta tai mai is like what you put forward. They even talk about stranger formality [speaking Japanese], where you put that forward. So this is not unique to Japanese. It\u2019s also found in every English-speaking culture and everywhere else. So I think that podcasting is an opportunity to not only listen and consume, but develop your own abilities of question asking and empathy that can aid you in your conversation with anyone, not just those who are related to the iTunes universe or otherwise. Tell you what man, I\u2019ve got to run. I\u2019m going to grab some more exogenous ketones, maybe some more gin. But I think I got to pull this to a close. Chris: All right, man. I appreciate the phone call. It was a pleasure talking to you. Tim Ferriss: Likewise. Take it easy, bye.

want to know about the gin i had, well, you\u2019re going to have to sign up for 5-bullet friday", "that\u2019s where i talk about such things", "fourhourworkweek.com/friday, all spelled out", "but i talk about in this particular case, things ranging from parenting advice based on advice from my friends and podcast guests, to how to get started in podcasting, to thinking about jumping from one industry to the next, to considering moves from say the east coast to the west coast of the u.s., and many, many, many, many, many other questions that are alcohol-infused for your entertainment delight", "i hope you enjoy it", "i was very happy with how this turned out and without further ado, as i always say, please enjoy this q&a, answering some of your most burning questions from somewhere around 5 to 15 people", "that is about it as far as preambles go", "so please enjoy and as always, thank you for listening", "[phone rings] hello", "josh: hello", "hi, is this josh", "josh: it is", "josh, this is tim ferriss", "how are you this evening", "josh: doing well", "how are you", "i\u2019m splendid", "i am having a disgusting cocktail of some type of blueberry sparkling water with gin", "i\u2019m getting an evil eye for that comment", "but i am glad you dropped in your phone number and name", "so i\u2019m all yours for the next couple minutes", "josh: yeah, well i appreciate it, man", "i mean, if i can take a moment to just say thanks for everything that you do and man, my whole family just loves all the lessons and teachings that you throw out there for us", "it\u2019s been awesome", "thanks, man", "i appreciate that", "josh: so i won\u2019t take too much time, but yeah, i mean, i have a family of four children and we\u2019ve kind of been on this kind of crazy trajectory since your first book and living in southern california and kind of living it up based on the principles learned from that book", "so it\u2019s been awesome", "congratulations, man", "thank you", "josh: yeah, and then the second book came out and i dropped 40 pounds in 2010 and been able to keep it off, so whole life\u2019s been impacted", "so really appreciate that", "nice work, man", "josh: yeah, i\u2019ll cut to the question", "my question is \u2013 kind of back to my kids \u2013 i\u2019ve got four kids, i\u2019m 37", "my oldest is 15, the next one is 14", "so i\u2019ve got two kids in high school right now", "you often ask the question to your guests about what would they tell themselves at age 20 or in their early 20s as they\u2019re getting started", "i want to look a little bit earlier and look at age 14 to age 15 and the reason why is because you\u2019ve often said in your past that you were most impacted maybe when you were a freshman or early high school age by coaches, teachers, trip to japan, whatever", "i feel like just observing my kids, it\u2019s such a pivotal time in their life", "but what would your toolkit look like for teenagers and maybe for yourself, but also as a parent, if you were a parent of teenagers", "what would your toolkit look like for those kids as a parent", "great question", "i should say, first of all, that as you probably know, i don\u2019t have kids", "so i think that i may be a bit of an armchair quarterback in answering this, but based on my conversations with close friends of mine who i consider in this case to be very good dads, i think i can speak to it", "that would include quite a few of the podcast guests", "so whether that is say josh waitzkin, who i think has a lot to offer, or jamie foxx or others", "there are a few things that come to mind and you\u2019re right that i was very impacted between say 14 and 16 by coaches and a handful of teachers", "i do think that freshman/sophomore window is a critical inflection point; whether they\u2019re going in the right direction or the wrong direction, for a lot of kids", "it certainly was true for me, which is why i wanted to teach ninth grade for a long time", "i thought that was my ultimate destination was teaching ninth grade", "but to your question, i would say that there are a few things i would emphasize and there are different ways to emphasize", "in other words, there are the principles and then there\u2019s how you convey those principles, right", "so the first would be quite simply you are the average of the five people you associate with most and how financially, academically, physically, you are going to be the average of the people you spend the most time with, so you need to choose and should choose your friends very carefully", "if you think that you can be the standout a-student, top-performing athlete, etc", "among a bunch of misfits who you happen to like, you are mistaken", "that just is not the case", "it\u2019s true for adults; it\u2019s true for kids, right", "now that could come off as somewhat preachy", "there are other ways, i think, that you can condition your kids to ultimately be more likely to succeed in academics and in life", "one is getting them accustomed to failure and being humbled very early on, or at least on a regular basis", "so if you were to ask someone like jocko willink, for instance, the former navy seal commander who\u2019s been on the podcast, jiu jitsu would be a great tool for men or women, boys or girls", "i think that is a great training ground and a lot of those individual sports have an accountability that sometimes you are lacking in team sports", "i played team sports when you\u2019re on, say the wrestling mat, psychologically it\u2019s just a different kettle of fish", "you deserve the credit or the blame for your successes or failures, respectively", "then i would say last, the next thing that comes to mind, at least, is called grit, g-r-i-t, which is about resilience", "it looks a lot at kids, specifically", "josh waitzkin (who is the basis and the inspiration for searching for bobby fischer, the movie and the book) turned me on to this and i\u2019m blanking on the author\u2019s name, but it\u2019s really about teaching your kids to focus on hard work and not intrinsic capability", "in other words, they\u2019re able to develop an internal locus of control where they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re dependent on external factors for success", "josh does that in a bunch of interesting ways", "for instance, when he was raising (or is raising), his son jack, from the very early days he noticed parents talking about good weather/bad weather", "we can\u2019t go out, it\u2019s bad weather", "we should go out, it\u2019s good weather", "and he flipped it on its head and, of course, this wouldn\u2019t apply to your high school kids, but it does in other contexts", "he would say, \u201cit\u2019s a beautiful, rainy day, jack", "why don\u2019t we go out?\u201d and he would always go outside and play with his kid in the rain", "i think there are ways to simulate that and create conditions for that", "the other thing is not to make it too curriculum based, but i really feel like if you are able to get your kids in some fashion excited about improving their written or spoken communication in any capacity, i feel like that is a huge competitive advantage in life", "you can add the ability to public speak or write clearly on top of any other skillset and you\u2019re automatically in like the top 25 percent in almost any arena, if that makes sense", "josh: yeah, that\u2019s interesting", "that might be the first time i\u2019ve heard you maybe say that in that way", "and i understand that being my age now", "how do you think you teach that", "again, thinking about as a parent you\u2019re a teacher, but half the time your kids don\u2019t listen to you because you are their parent", "yeah, for sure", "josh: which is maybe the piece of the puzzle that you\u2019re missing you don\u2019t have the kids, but when you think about \u2013 because i think that is an excellent principle and it\u2019s something that i maybe wish i\u2019d spent more time on at that age", "how would you think getting through to your kids with those specific skills: writing, speaking", "yeah, i would look at who influences them, first of all", "so who do they listen to", "i would actually take an indirect path", "so if your kids are prone \u2013 and i think teenagers are particularly prone to being like, oh, dad\u2019s preaching again or whatever the hell it happens to be, right", "figuring out who they listen to", "my mom did this in a very interesting way when i was actually 15", "side note: i don\u2019t know if i\u2019ve ever talked about this publicly", "15, i was in japan, and i\u2019ve always suffered from sensitivity to heat and i\u2019ve actually been hospitalized a few times", "it\u2019s a long story, but i have lung issues, respiratory issues", "so i was hospitalized in japan at one point because i insisted on training through the pain, wearing a judo outfit, in like 90 percent humidity and 100\u00b0 weather, which was stupid, right", "my mom knew on some level that i might not listen to her or take it with a grain of salt or something like that, so she went to a previous martial arts instructor who had a huge impact on me, who i took very seriously, and had him record a vhs tape", "i\u2019m not kidding", "this is back in the day", "she shipped it to japan, where he sort of gave me like a man-to-man talking to, so to speak, about the risks and payoffs, potential benefits, downsides, etc", "of all this stuff and that was the intervention that worked", "so i think that there are different ways to reach kids depending on who they listen to", "i think that\u2019s the path of least resistance", "so if you looked at \u2013 and they may be too young for this \u2013 but, for instance, warren buffett cites as his best ever investment a dale carnegie course in public speaking", "josh: interesting", "so if the richest man in the world (or one of the richest men in the world), certainly most successful equity investor of all time, potentially might pull some weight, then that could be an indirect way to do it", "it\u2019s to somehow expose them to that in a non-preachy way", "the other way to do it, quite frankly, is to impress the hell out of them with someone who is an incredible public speaker or writer", "so it could be as simple as exposing them to a commencement speak from someone like neil gaiman", "his \u201cmake good art\u201d commencement speech is just incredible", "that could be another path", "those are a few things that come to mind", "in terms of writing, i would say if there\u2019s any type of writing that might get them hooked on reading that is probably the trojan horse into getting them to focus on better communication themselves", "i think getting them hooked on if it\u2019s science fiction, maybe it\u2019s something from neal stephenson", "if it\u2019s any type of writing, if it\u2019s non-fiction, maybe it\u2019s something from john mcphee", "something that makes them go, holy shit, i thought i knew what good writing was", "ohmygod, like this guy is amazing or this gal is amazing, would be a great way to go", "it doesn\u2019t have to be your recommendation to them to focus on the writing", "it could be the subject matter", "so for instance, if \u2013 i\u2019m just trying to think of a good example \u2013 maybe the autobiography of andre agassi, which was ghost written", "it wasn\u2019t written by andre agassi, but the ghost writer is just a phenomenal storyteller and there are a lot of life lessons and competitive lessons learned in that book", "it\u2019s a phenomenal read, right", "so you could suggest it just because of the autobiography", "they\u2019re going to finish the book and they\u2019re going to go, holy crap that was an amazing book", "that might be what trips the wire and gets them interested in writing", "but i think the soft approach is probably \u2013 and this is just, again, speaking as a complete poser who does not have kids \u2013 i would say just knowing how i was as a teenager, i think the indirect jedi mind trick approach is probably the better way to go when possible", "josh: that is really good", "that is really good advice", "i actually think you come from a position of advantage because you don\u2019t have kids, which means you don\u2019t have the emotional connection of them pissing you off or making you happy or trying to protect them in any way, so i actually think that is a position of advantage because it\u2019s just different having kids", "i might borrow that, yeah", "josh: no, good stuff", "i actually really appreciate that story about your mom and you\u2019ve mentioned her a couple times", "she seems like a phenomenal woman, so tell her thank you", "yeah, i will", "my parents are staying with me for the next three weeks, so i should have an opportunity shortly to let them know", "but i tell you what, man, hopefully that\u2019s helpful", "i highly recommend the book, grit", "i think that will touch on a lot of what we talked about", "if you haven\u2019t heard the josh waitzkin episodes, i would definitely listen to those because he talks about his son a lot", "even though his son is much younger, i think the way he thinks about it and the architecture of his mind, the principles that he applies are still extremely applicable to a high school aged kid, for sure", "josh: yeah, no, for sure", "i have and actually have had my kids listen to different pieces of those", "right now, i have the two youngest listening to the graveyard book", "oh, yeah, that\u2019s a great one", "josh: we\u2019re all kind of hooked", "that one\u2019s phenomenal and we\u2019re all hooked on that one", "i appreciate it", "i won\u2019t take up any more of your time", "i know you\u2019ve got a busy night ahead of you, so i appreciate it and thank you again", "for sure, man", "i appreciate you reading my stuff and more than that, putting it into practice", "i\u2019m stoked your kids are listening to the graveyard book", "that\u2019s a winner", "josh: yeah, okay, man", "good luck", "all right, man", "have a good night", "good luck", "bye", "[phone rings] matt: this is matt", "hey, matt", "this is tim ferriss calling", "how are you, sir", "matt: hey, tim", "how are you", "good", "i\u2019m good",

i\u2019m actually in new york", "you are", "matt: i live sort of outside of melbourne, but was speaking at new york comic con, well yesterday i guess it was now", "so yeah, here until tomorrow", "good man", "comic con", "i\u2019ve still never been to any version of comic con, but i have been to melbourne, which i guess i live in the melbourne of the united states, meaning san francisco", "matt: you do", "very similar towns", "so i\u2019m all \u2013 matt: yeah, i was there on tuesday actually", "wow, you are a jet setter", "i thought i traveled a lot", "matt: not usually", "you just caught me on a good week", "what were you speaking about at comic con", "matt: about how to teach people to be heroes in real life", "that\u2019s kind of my field", "i do a lot of trainings with kids", "i\u2019m just sort of getting into adults as well", "but sort of combining acknowledging psychology and getting into some habits to put in practice so that you\u2019re going to be the person who stands up instead of being a bystander", "and then putting it into play with sort of physical stuff as well", "i worked with dan edwardes with parkour generations in london and we\u2019re doing some work with joe de sena early next year", "that kind of stuff", "getting prepped", "oh, be careful with that joe de sena", "he might make you carry a kettle bell up and down a mountain for 5 hours or 12, or 76", "matt: yeah, no", "i\u2019m very wary of that", "well, that sounds like good work, man", "what can i answer for you, if anything", "matt: well, i listen to the podcast and i keep hearing you get close to talking about heroes and heroism", "whether it\u2019s talking about the hero\u2019s journey", "i remember you talking to jon favreau sort of about your general interest in writing fiction and how the hero\u2019s journey plays into that", "god, who was the guy recently you had on", "shep gordon talking about how our heroes have changed from now to 30 years ago, what that looks like", "so i\u2019m just curious to hear from you who are your heroes", "what does that mean to you", "ooh, that\u2019s a good one", "well, i would say that the first people to come to mind are a handful of folks who were merry pranksters, of sorts, but very good in multiple fields and maybe this is just to make myself feel better, but i view these as professional dilettantes of sorts", "they were willing to experiment as amateurs in multiple fields", "so a few of the people who come to mind are richard feynman, who was a physicist and an incredible teacher, but was also an accomplished safe cracker, bongo player, you name it", "his book, surely you must be joking, mr", "feynman, is one of my favorites", "so he is right at the top of the list", "ben franklin would be right at the top of the list", "i think his biography by walter isaacson is fantastic", "he was a real character", "he was a publisher in many ways, and a printer, rather, before he became any diplomat", "just a hilarious character", "so i think those are two who come to mind", "on top of that, you have a handful of folks from my own life, who would include my wrestling coach in high school, john buxton", "it would include my guidance counselor of sorts or my resident advisor in high school, named richard greenleaf, who is a reverend", "i think what all these \u2013 matt: what are the reasons behind them", "well, i think they are actually related to the first two", "they all question the consensus reality, in a sense, to use a phrase from eric weinstein and peter thiel, insomuch as i was told by my guidance counselor, for instance, in high school that i should not apply to princeton, where i ended up going as an undergrad", "at the time, i didn\u2019t really have the toolkit to ask myself what is this person\u2019s incentive", "and their incentive is, of course, to be able to say 80 percent of my advisees got into their first choice college", "well, that produces some perverse behavior in the sense that the easiest way to accomplish that goal is to have kids lower their sights, right", "so richard greenleaf was one who said to me, \u201ci think you can get in", "i think you should apply", "i think that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d what was able to convince me to believe in myself when other people effectively told me not to", "john buxton, similarly, was a hard ass in the bet way possible, who just didn\u2019t tolerate people or, in this case, students thinking that they weren\u2019t capable of what he knew them to be capable of, if that makes sense", "i think one of the downfalls in my mind of modern, at least u.s", "society or societal norms \u2013 and i suspect this applies elsewhere in the commonwealth probably \u2013 is that you have a political correctness that leads to everyone or a lot of people treating others with kid gloves", "i think that is a disservice in that you are, in fact, woefully underpreparing people for reality if you don\u2019t give them tough love", "if you look at john buxton and, for instance, if you look at the wrestling team \u2013 and he was much more that a wrestling coach", "he was an english teacher", "he raised i think hundreds of millions of dollars for the endowment of the school i attended, which was st", "paul\u2019s, after public school", "he is a very multi-faceted guy", "he was the one to say no, you\u2019re not going to quit because i know you\u2019re capable of more", "go do what you have to do", "if you\u2019re feeling sick because you\u2019re training too hard, go puke in the bucket over there and after you return from the corner, you\u2019re going to train for another two hours", "at the end of those two hours, you\u2019re like oh, shit; i\u2019m actually capable of 50 percent more than i thought i was", "in that way, they were able to make people around them think they were capable of more than they had previously thought", "that\u2019s a tremendous super power in a way", "yeah, so that\u2019s why they would fall into a similar category", "matt: absolutely, yeah", "i think you\u2019ve had some interaction with jennifer miller", "she was maybe a case study in 4-hour workweek", "she traveled the world with her kids", "she just wrote a post yesterday about her now-20-year-old, i think, daughter, who\u2019s sort of struggling through math in college and just was talking about their whole education philosophy and it was we\u2019re going to push you", "we\u2019re going to teach you latin when you\u2019re five and we\u2019re going to make you do math all the way through to twelfth grade because it\u2019s going to help you", "you may hate it and you may scream at us, but you\u2019re going to do it", "that\u2019s not happening in the school systems anywhere", "yeah, i think that it\u2019s very important, if anything, i try to do this with my audience en masse, which can be challenging of course when you\u2019re dealing with millions of people, is to say okay, you think you\u2019re capable of x, but i would vote for myself and for everyone listening that\u2019s actually bullshit and you\u2019re capable of x plus 20 percent, at the very least", "so let\u2019s push for that and you only know what you\u2019re capable of if you push yourself close to the breaking point", "certainly as a student, i was selling myself short; as an athlete, i was selling myself short", "what the john buxtons of the world taught me was you can and should dream bigger", "don\u2019t be so impressed by all americans in sport x", "don\u2019t be so impressed by someone who placed in the top 10 in xyz national competition", "that is actually within reach if you apply yourself and work hard, but you\u2019re going to have to endure incredible amounts of discomfort", "period", "that\u2019s it", "i think that the people i view as heroes in my life are those who have forced me to have uncomfortable conversations, do uncomfortable things", "because i think that whatever we view as success is probably just an inch outside of our sphere of comfort, if that makes sense", "so the people who push you beyond that are the people you should thank", "the people who say everything is great, everything is going to be fine, there\u2019s a place for that but if that is their unified line for all circumstances, they\u2019re not doing you any favors, if that makes sense", "matt: yeah, definitely", "if you do well enough, you don\u2019t have to worry, right", "it\u2019s just get to this stand and then you\u2019ll be all good", "there\u2019s no pushing beyond that", "yeah", "i know that, for instance, if you look at new zealand or you look at australia, you hear a lot about \u201ctall poppy syndrome,\u201d and that\u2019s not something that people in the u.s", "hear very much", "in effect, it\u2019s actually very related to something in japanese, which is the nail that sticks out will get hammered down", "but tall poppy syndrome being if someone really sticks out and strives to be excellent, they get cut down by their peers, right", "so i would say complementary skillset that the heroes i mentioned in part is they have, at one point or another, been the one against the many and they\u2019re able to help not just teach but condition their students to be able to face criticism and to be able to dismiss criticism when necessary to do what needs to be done", "that\u2019s not a comfortable process", "it just is not", "matt: yeah, and things being uncomfortable is critical for any potential hero too", "you\u2019ve got to be comfortable stepping out of the crowd, doing the thing that no one else is doing", "it\u2019s a thing a lot of people have to practice", "yeah, just a pre-req", "it\u2019s a straight pre-req", "not to quote my own book, because i hate people who do that but i\u2019m drunk enough that i\u2019ll do that, which is there\u2019s a line \u2013 and the only reason i bring it up is that it\u2019s one of the most highlighted on kindle, is \u2013 your success in life, by and large, can be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have", "that is a skill you can practice", "that is a skill you can develop", "that is a coachable skill", "that\u2019s why, for a long time, i had actually \u2013 and it\u2019s still on my refrigerator in new york \u2013 is a magnet that says \u201cevery day do one thing that scares you.\u201d in effect; i\u2019m paraphrasing", "that\u2019s a quote from, i think it\u2019s eleanor roosevelt", "it is a reminder that developing these abilities is a habit", "it is not a decision; it is a habit", "you have to condition yourself", "just like weight training or anything else", "matt: that\u2019s a habit of heroism", "that sums up my whole work is if you practice it, you are going to be the one that steps up and helps when needed", "yeah, exactly", "cool, man", "well, i tell you what", "i\u2019ve got to hop because i\u2019m realizing i have quite a few phone calls to make", "matt: you have, yeah", "very good question", "so thank you for that", "matt: thank you", "i appreciate the time", "for sure, man", "matt: enjoy the rest of your night, which will no doubt get more amusing", "oh, yeah", "it\u2019ll get more amusing", "i know you aussies know how to drink", "i don\u2019t, so this will be even more ridiculous", "have a good weekend", "matt:

a urinal and they would pitch over my shoulder like breathing onto my neck, their start-up", "these are all start-up pitch related", "i have to tell everybody out there, it doesn\u2019t matter how good your pitch is if you\u2019re breathing on my neck when i have my penis in my hand", "it\u2019s not a good particular setup for a high close rate, i would say", "so that would be very high on the awkward list", "i\u2019ve had some people, and i think living in san francisco, i have a high percentage \u2013 not a high percentage, but a reasonable percentage of low eq, high iq folks", "i\u2019ve had people come over to me when i\u2019m having dinner with someone and literally just pull a chair over and sit down at my dinner table to pitch me start-up pitches, which is, again, not ideal protocol for getting a high close rate", "so those are a couple of the awkward ones", "one memorable one, and this is the way you should do it, quite frankly, is i\u2019ve had a handful of people come up to me at different events and it\u2019s after i\u2019ve given a keynote or something like that so there are many people who are asking me questions, pitching me things", "they very simply say, \u201ci know you\u2019re super busy right now; you\u2019re going to be occupied for the next couple of hours", "here is a quick pitch that i wrote down", "i think you\u2019ll find it interesting,\u201d and they hand me a letter", "that is, i think, the most methodical and smart way to go about it", "if you\u2019re going to pitch me something \u2013 and i\u2019m fine with being pitched \u2013 i don\u2019t want to be tricked", "i don\u2019t want to be seduced with a bunch of unsolicited favors and then \u201coh, by the way, i have my book coming out in the three weeks", "could you give me a blurb?\u201d i don\u2019t like that", "i\u2019m fine with explicit pitches, but in an environment where you are competing with potentially hundreds of people who want to ask me something or pitch me something, the best way you can stand out is to give me something that i stick in my pocket that i can review later on my own time", "very few people do that", "at a given event of say even 5,000 attendees, i will get maybe two of those", "so i would say those are the first memorable interactions that come to mind because they\u2019re very effective", "i think that\u2019s a smart way to approach pitching busy people when you meet them in person", "it\u2019s not to actually verbally deliver the pitch, but is to give them something you\u2019ve taken the time to make as perfect as possible on paper and give to them", "ryan: cool", "well, that\u2019s the only question i had", "i want to keep it brief so you can talk to all the other people who are on the list", "if it\u2019s okay with you, i\u2019d like to maybe end the call with just a quick challenge for everyone in the podcast listening audience", "i know on your 36th birthday you gave up your birthday to raise funds for charity: water", "i just wanted to challenge everyone in the audience to do the same", "i think charity: water is a great organization", "i\u2019m not affiliated with them; i don\u2019t work for them, but i think they\u2019re just amazing", "i think scott harrison built something really cool and they\u2019re just doing amazing work all around the world", "for everyone who\u2019s interested, if you go to charitywater.org, you can set up a birthday campaign", "it\u2019s super easy; it just takes a few minutes", "like tim, tim raised over $100,000 for his birthday and people all over the world have had campaigns that have raised thousands of dollars for a worthwhile cause", "so i just want to challenge everyone in the audience", "i think it\u2019s a worthwhile cause", "check it out and thank you so much for your time, tim", "i really appreciate it", "have a good rest of your night", "for sure, man", "that\u2019s a good challenge", "i second that", "and if you just want to see also, for those people listening who are like man, i\u2019m not sure i\u2019m going to do that", "but, i would say if you want to see how a non-profit can structure and promote itself in part using design in a very smart way, then charity: water, just for that reason alone, if you want to get a mini-mba in how to use design to promote a non-profit, which is in and of itself very difficult, then you should check out charity: water", "so i agree with you wholeheartedly", "thanks for the question", "have a great weekend", "ryan: no problem", "thank you, tim", "all right, man", "bye", "[phone rings] bobby: hey, this is bobby", "leave me a message and i\u2019ll call you back if i like you", "bobby, damnation", "this is tim ferriss", "i\u2019ve had way too much gin and i\u2019m prepared to make an ass of myself and i\u2019m afraid we have missed our opportunity to connect", "have a glorious evening and a spectacular weekend, good sir", "goodbye", "[phone rings] justin: hello", "hi, is this justin", "justin: it is, hi", "justin, this is tim ferriss", "how are you, sir", "justin: i\u2019m good, thank you", "and how are you", "i\u2019m good", "where am i finding you at the moment", "justin: i am in evanston, illinois", "evanston, illinois", "one of my favorite towns", "justin: really", "i\u2019m kidding", "i\u2019ve never been", "but i\u2019m all yours for the next handful of minutes", "i\u2019m getting drunker by the minute, so that should produce increasingly unusable answers, but i am available, so please shoot", "justin: sure", "i just have a question about teaching", "so you\u2019ve obviously learned so much and been coached by some really awesome people for all these various skills", "i just want to know, are there specific qualities that you look for when you\u2019re trying to look for a teacher in particular", "or are there resources and tactics that you try to find when you seek someone outside of your network", "definitely", "i would say there are a handful of things that come to mind immediately", "so the first is when assessing teachers, no", "1: have they been able to replicate their own results", "that is to underscore the fact that just because people are good at performing or have a performance record that is very impressive does not necessarily mean that they know how to then transmit that knowledge and know-how to other people", "many top performers are extremely good at what they do \u2013 yes, because of some technical or strategic planning, but also because of incredible genetics", "it is one of my first hurdles to look for their ability to replicate their results with students", "so that\u2019s no", "1", "no", "2 would be a question of sorts and that is, are they good at questioning assumptions", "are they good at questioning best practices", "are they willing to experiment with things that might not or should not work based on the literature, for instance", "that is a reflection of open-mindedness and general objectivity that i seek in teachers also", "third would be \u2013 and this is something i\u2019ve mentioned before, but \u2013 their willingness to be tough and uncompromising", "so their ability and willingness to have tough love and to force people to do what they think they cannot do", "which is extremely important because any novice, certainly even any intermediate coming into a field will probably underestimate their own capabilities", "you need someone not just to tell you that you can do more, but to prove to you that you can do more", "the way they do that is by forcing you to confront discomfort in practice, generally", "those are a handful of the things that i would say i look for", "justin: okay, thank you", "so you would just do your homework on this teacher, for example, before you try them out or would you just go meet with them, talk to them and see how they do their style to find out whether they have these qualities", "i would do both", "i would do my homework and then i would ask them questions related to the qualitied that i just described", "those questions could be, how many people have you replicated your own performance with", "and if they haven\u2019t, that\u2019s not necessarily a disqualifier, but the answer will tell you a lot", "if they say, well, i haven\u2019t replicated my own results with many people because i have the genetic advantage of being designed like a spider for ultra-endurance running, for instance", "i\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d and weigh 110 pounds and i\u2019m great at dissipating heat", "however, i\u2019ve been able to train ten people to do x, y, and z", "that itself reflects a self-awareness and an awareness that i think contributes to being a very good teacher", "so if they are a genetic anomaly, that doesn\u2019t disqualify them, but they need to be aware of that fact", "you could ask questions related to really any of the characteristics that i described that would help you to assess whether or not you want to invest the time, energy and/or money into training with someone", "so that would be i think my general approach", "it\u2019s astonishing, really, to someone who hasn\u2019t attempted what i\u2019m about to describe", "how affordable it can be to get extremely good advice via skype, for instance, from gold medalists or world-class performers in almost any field for very little", "this is particularly true in athletics, where you can get generally between $100 or $300 per hour, one-to-one coaching from someone who is one of the best \u2013 meaning top 10 at some point, in the world, in their given field", "i mean, that is just a bargain and something worth saving for", "so those would be my initial thoughts", "justin: okay", "well, thank you very much", "that was really helpful and yeah, i\u2019ll definitely keep a lot of that in mind when trying to find someone", "so, thanks", "all right", "well, i appreciate you dropping in your name and phone number", "so thanks for the time", "justin: thanks very much", "i love the content", "have a good weekend", "justin: you too", "there are also the deconstruction section in the 4-hour chef contains a lot of the questions that i tend to ask these types of experts, as well, if that\u2019s of any help", "justin: okay", "thanks so much", "all right", "yeah, have a great weekend", "bye", "justin: you too, bye", "[phone rings] austin, can you hear me", "austin: yeah", "yeah, i can hear you now", "this is tim ferriss calling to harass you", "how are you", "austin: hi, tim", "how are you", "i\u2019m good", "where are you located at the moment", "austin: i\u2019m in \u2013 like location in the world \u2013 i\u2019m in puyallup, washington", "it\u2019s kind of near seattle, tacoma, pacific northwest; up there", "yeah, dig it", "i like the pacific northwest", "lots of rain", "i love rain", "i\u2019m kidding", "austin: yeah, there is a lot of rain", "so i am at your disposal for the next little while", "how can i help or answer questions", "i may not do a good job, but i will do my best", "austin: i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great", "actually, i do have a question", "so over time, i\u2019ve listened to many of your podcasts and i know the different opinions of a lot of those you\u2019ve interviewed, but what would you say your personal view on a college education is", "if you were a 19 year old and you were achieving what you wanted to study in, whether it\u2019s in college or not, what do you think you\u2019d want to look towards or what field would you choose to study in", "why would you do that", "good question", "now, for context, are you \u2013 it would look like it from your email address, but are you in college at the moment", "austin: yeah", "i\u2019m at eastern washington university", "i\u2019m a junior right now and i\u2019m actually looking into economics and [inaudible] in the past week, i was looking into a physics minor too because i actually \u2013 funny, i listened to your podcast with peter diamandis and i read his book abundance and it just totally inspired me", "i really want to look into changing the world and doing stuff like that", "so short answer is i think economics plus physics is a really smart move", "there\u2019s a great article on \u2013 if you just search \u201ccareer advice\u201d and \u201cscott adams,\u201d he\u2019s the creator of dilbert", "it\u2019s a fantastic piece that\u2019s actually been echoed and referenced by marc andreessen, for instance, who is a pioneer in every sense of the possible word", "if you look at his technological innovations \u2013 mosaic, his investment practices and andreessen horowitz, which he\u2019s cofounded and helped build, the combination of those degrees gives you more than the sum of its parts, if that makes sense", "so first of all, i would say that a college education makes sense", "malcolm gladwell has talked about this is our conversation that we had on the podcast", "it makes sense if you know how to utilize it properly", "in other words, i think that a college education or an mba or anything like that, any advanced degree, makes sense in two cases: (a) if you go to a top-rated \u2013 and that\u2019s, of course, a whole different hornets\u2019 nest to dig into \u2013 but a top-rated university, or (b) if you develop a generalized skillset that allows you to succeed in the world and on top of that, have people who, at 1:00 in the morning, will stimulate and challenge you", "that\u2019s it, right", "so i am a personal proponent of a college education because of several things", "one of which is a survivorship bias that i think is dangerous when you look at those who romanticize lack of any college education", "so drop out of college, become a billionaire like marc \u2013 not marc, excuse me", "but zuckerberg, for instance", "the danger there is similar to the danger if you look at say at barron\u2019s magazine and read about the mutual funds who offer x, y, and z returns and have a fantastic track record", "the mutual funds who have failed don\u2019t have the money to advertise, nor do they want to advertise so they don\u2019t", "therefore, you\u2019re only seeing a very small percentage of the total mutual funds who, through skill or in many cases luck, have been able to beat the market for x number of years", "similarly, if you\u2019re only looking at the magazine covers, you\u2019re only reading about the handful of people who have dropped out, usually of a place like harvard or princeton or stanford or something like that, where they can always go back, who have beaten the odds and built a multi-billion-dollar company", "that is not the norm", "i think that having a college degree as a safety net is, in many cases, an extremely intelligent thing", "i certainly feel that way for myself and i feel that way for many people", "90+ percent of the people out there", "if you think you\u2019re mark zuckerberg, chances are you are not", "you have never met him", "you just do not understand the delta between where you are and where that person is", "now, you could be, but chances are you\u2019re not", "so i think having college education and a degree is extremely important and valuable in today\u2019s economy, as it exists in the united states", "in terms of majors and so on, we kind of hit this earlier, but i think the combination of a major and a minor that is unusual is very interesting", "so having a hard science element as one of those two increases your viability as a candidate, at least in high-tech start-ups", "so if that is one of your goals, if you have a micro and macro-economic, basic set of knowledge from a major and then a minor in physics, that shows (a) a familiarity with and a comfort with numbers, and (b) a comfort with a very uncompromising hard science known as physics, which includes a lot of mathematics", "so that is a huge advantage, i think, over people who come to the table with just one major", "on top of that, i would say anything you can do, and this could be extra-curricular or it could be in the university itself, to improve your ability to communicate really puts whatever you\u2019ve done on steroids", "that\u2019s a very clich\u00e9d expression, but i know a lot about steroids and they can be really effective in legal and competent context", "so i think i\u2019ve probably had too much gin and you shouldn\u2019t do steroids, by the way, that would be terrible for your longevity in life and all these other good things", "but i digress", "so what i\u2019m saying, and there\u2019s someone sitting about 15 feet away from me shaking her head right now", "but i\u2019ve had a lot of gin", "that\u2019s the whole point of this fucking drunk dial thing", "so i would say that if you can \u2013 so let me take a step back", "a lot of engineers, a lot of people who are quantitatively comfortable believe that logical arguments win the day", "if you can provide a highly logical, if (a), then (b), therefore (c), you will win the contract", "you will get the job", "you will fill-in-the-blank", "that is just not the case", "you need to be able to communicate in both a rational and also emotionally compelling way", "if you can add the ability to communicate clearly, whether that\u2019s verbally and/or ideally, written, that will give you a huge advantage over at least 50 percent of the people who are competing for a similar slot", "so those would be my initial thoughts", "but as far as a liberal arts undergraduate degree is concerned, i really feel like you should just study what interests you most", "i was initially a neuroscience, or i should say psychology major with an emphasis in neuroscience, and then an east asian studies degree", "that at first glance would seem to have nothing to do with what i did later, but you have your entire life to be a fucking adult", "i would explore what interests you during college", "it\u2019s an incredible, golden opportunity and a window that is very brief to develop yourself, not as an eligible candidate for the job market, but as a well-rounded human being", "i know that probably sounds hokey", "it might sound clich\u00e9d", "austin: not at all", "i\u2019ve had a fair amount of gin", "but most people spend the remainder of their life after graduating from college trying to reestablish the quality of life and carefree sentiment that they had while they were in college", "so i would encourage you to study what most interests you", "but if your predilection is already towards economics plus physics, that\u2019s a fucking killer combo, so i would stick with that", "austin: that\u2019s great to hear, yeah", "actually, i can\u2019t remember", "probably when i was in about ninth grade or tenth grade, actually the 4-hour workweek \u2013 my dad introduced me to it and i read it and it really changed the course of everything that i lived towards and really just realizing that i can do what i want in life and really freedom is a real possibility and financial stability and i can achieve that", "not just that, but really doing what you like", "so i think actually just recently, like i said, the physics component has come in and like i said, i listen to your podcast and i\u2019m super inspired", "i actually started listening to peter\u2019s podcast because of that and that really shaped the path that i\u2019m on right now", "so thank you very much for being so inspiring", "congratulations, man", "well, you sound like you are in a great place", "peter is fantastic, obviously", "i mean, every time i meet peter, i come away thinking, what the fuck am i doing with my life", "he\u2019s a very big-scale thinker, which is good because he stretches me and he makes me uncomfortable in all the ways that are the most productive", "so i appreciate you listening to the podcast and it sounds like you\u2019re in a great place, man", "i would just say keep doing what you\u2019re doing", "if economics and physics are the path, then that\u2019s the path", "if you compelled to study something that seems useless like classics \u2013 guess what", "i know people who\u2019ve made hundreds of millions of dollars who have studied classics", "it\u2019s not the end all, be all", "learning early, however, to follow your passion and pay attention to that intuition i think is incredibly valuable beyond any extent to which you can currently imagine", "so i would cultivate that", "if you neuter that, if you mute that, if you suffocate that, you are in for a world of hurt for a very long period of time", "you may feel like you\u2019re gaining in the short-term, but you will really suffer in the long-term", "i would just say chase what excites you and honestly the rest will generally take care of itself", "if you chase what excites you, you\u2019re going to be good at what you pursue", "austin: that\u2019s what i\u2019ve heard over and over", "if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to be mediocre because you just will not have the endurance the horsepower to push through the inevitable obstacles that\u2019ll turn up", "so that would be my thought", "yeah, man", "crush it", "i\u2019ve got dozens of start-ups who will probably hire you", "so keep plugging along", "austin: perfect", "thank you so much for your input and for your books and everything", "i can\u2019t wait for the next book to come out", "i\u2019m going to pre-order that on amazon and get that shipped here and everything", "thank you so much", "of course, man", "i appreciate you reading and yeah, tools of titans will be fun", "i can say this because i didn\u2019t actually write most of it", "it\u2019s related to the learnings and lessons from other people, but yeah, it\u2019s a fun read", "i think you\u2019ll dig it", "so i will let you go, but have a great weekend", "i appreciate you dropping in your name and your phone number", "austin: perfect, thank you", "thank you so much for the call and for everything", "all right, man", "take it easy, bye", "austin: you too, bye", "[phone rings] eric: hello", "eric, this is tim", "eric: hey, tim", "how art thou", "eric: good, how are you", "oh, i\u2019m great", "i\u2019m fantastic", "sitting at my acacia wood table, if that means anything to anyone", "i think actually, giraffe eat acacia, for what that\u2019s worth", "let\u2019s see here", "so where \u2013 actually, you seem like you might be in new york, but i\u2019m not sure, based on the number", "where are you", "eric: i\u2019m in new york city, yeah", "one of the best towns on earth", "it\u2019s a good spot", "eric: yeah, lived here all my life", "say again", "eric: i said i\u2019ve lived here all my life", "oh, no kidding", "born and raised", "eric: yeah", "yeah, it\u2019s a good town", "hey, man", "i was born out on strong island", "although most new yorkers don\u2019t count that as new york", "it\u2019s kind of like the red-headed stepchild of new york state", "which is okay", "eric: just a little bit", "yeah, it gets kind of a bad rep", "yeah, you know", "rat tails and all that", "but that\u2019s okay", "so how can i be of service", "i\u2019m happy to answer any questions or attempt to and bumble, as i think is more likely at this point in my blood alcohol content surge, but fire away", "eric: okay", "so i\u2019ve actually been considering starting my own podcast, where i interview people in my field", "so seeing how you have your podcast and you\u2019ve had what now", "two years almost of experience doing it", "yeah", "eric: i would love some advice on that", "my background is in software development and security and what i really want to do \u2013 what gets me really jazzed is interviewing people in my people who have done exceptional things and who would have great stories to tell and research they\u2019ve done or really cool projects they started", "the problem is, i don\u2019t really have a recognizable name yet in my field", "so what i\u2019m wondering is, how would you recommend i get experts\u2019 attention in my field and how might i convince them to come on to my show", "start small and roll your way up", "so you should get whoever you can get and then level up one degree", "recruit and once you\u2019ve done that, level up one degree", "recruit and rinse and repeat", "it is the approach that i took and it is the approach that you generally should take", "there was a presentation by matt cutts of google, or at least at the time of google, who talked about the katamari principle or it might have been katamari damacy \u2013 i think it\u2019s a japanese video game", "in any case, the basic idea is that whether it\u2019s with a blog or podcast, you start with a very niche focus", "in this video game, katamari damacy i think it is, you have sort of a lint ball that you roll up and you accumulate larger things and then eventually you get to a point where you\u2019re actually rolling up planets and galaxies and so on", "eric: oh yeah", "i\u2019ve played this game actually", "it sounds really familiar", "okay", "yeah, you know what i\u2019m talking about", "eric: back on like playstation 1", "exactly", "so you start out very niche and that allows you to go after higher caliber people in a narrow field", "that would be step, or i should say principle 1", "on top of that, i would commit to doing a minimum of six episodes or at least recording a minimum of six episodes", "there are a few reasons for this", "no", "1, the itn\u2019s algorithm rewards multiple episodes and downloads being received by listeners at the same time", "so you\u2019re best served by uploading two or three, at the minimum, episodes for your debut", "no", "2 is that whenever i\u2019m considering taking on a new project, for instance podcasting or otherwise, i look for the ways in which \u2013 and i assess for each of the options i might be considering \u2013 the ways in which i can win even if the project fails", "so let\u2019s say your podcast does not take off or you don\u2019t like it", "you decide, for whatever reason, that you\u2019re going to quit after six episodes", "how can you format the podcast, how can you prepare it, how can you work on it in such a way that you develop skills or relationships that persist and accumulate after those six episodes", "in other words, if after six you decide to throw in the towel and quit, how can that still be a success", "i think this is a very important question", "for me, it was eliminating verbal tics, or minimizing them", "i\u2019m not done, obviously", "improving my ability to ask questions", "improving my ability to ask follow-up questions", "improving my ability to set silence do the work, as cal fussman would say, who has been on the podcast", "not jump in when someone is struggling to answer something", "all of those abilities, for me, translate and would have translated even if i had quit after six episodes, which was my personal commitment to improving my ability to do research and interview for book projects", "so in that capacity, i could win, develop those skills, even if the podcast were a failure", "so i would think very carefully on that and potentially journal on that question", "commit to writing three, freeform, longhand pages first thing at the morning at some point based on that to determine how can this be a success even if it\u2019s a failure to outside eyes", "so those would be a few of the things that come to mind offhand when you ask that question", "but i\u2019m happy to dig deeper", "eric: awesome, yeah", "no, i think those sound like great starting points for me", "i really like the concept of making it a game you can\u2019t lose, right", "you\u2019re going to get something out of it and have to decide what those things are going to be in advance", "exactly, yeah", "as an engineer, it sounds like you\u2019re an engineer, this is not an alien concept, right", "it\u2019s just applied to an audio podcasting arena, but you\u2019re going to be \u2013 given your experience as an engineer, i think better at codifying certain things and determining best practices for certain things, than a lay, non-engineering audience, which i would put myself smack dab in the middle of, unfortunately", "i wish i had more engineering and quantitative comfort, but i just do not", "so that\u2019s an unfortunate handicap, but i\u2019ve managed to make do", "so what other questions do you have about the podcasting", "i can answer those pretty directly, i think", "eric: well, that was my big one", "i think when i sit down and try to figure out what the first steps are", "i have some loose concepts of what i want to be interviewing people on", "i guess naturally the next question would be, how do you choose your questions", "well, let\u2019s tackle that a different way", "give me an example of someone who you would want to interview and let\u2019s start there", "who would you name", "eric: let\u2019s see \u2013 david heinemeier hansson", "ooh, yeah, dhh, ruby on rails, sure", "eric: yeah", "yeah, very interesting guy", "so what would you ask him", "if you had five minutes with him, what would the top three questions be", "eric: the first question that comes to mind is, what type of conditions was he in when he developed ruby on rails", "what really pushed him and motivated him to develop this technology and then open source it", "so i\u2019d be really interested in what his main motivator was at that time", "like what was going through his head that allowed him to commit to doing that", "it\u2019s a big project, so i\u2019d be really curious about that", "what next", "eric: the second one would be, what sort of changes did he go through in his life to go from \u2013 i believe he was working on basecamp at the time and he kind of changed paths a little bit in what he was doing", "he still is involved with that, but what changes did he go through that were unexpected", "what actually was going on", "i guess talking a little bit about his story", "i\u2019d want to know more about his story", "so the first one would be for me like a motivator", "what was his drive", "i think that can be really important to look at in individuals that excel and are motivated to do that and go outside of their comfort zone", "the second one would be what was his story", "what was changing in his life", "his narrative about that would be really interesting", "so i would suggest a complementary approach, which would be identify what he is most interested or excited to talk about and explore that first", "because that will put him at ease, allow him to tell a story that he likes to tell and open the gates for the other things", "i believe that in interviewing, being different at least for the first 10 to 15 minutes is more important than being better, if that makes sense", "so if you think to yourself, i would like to ask the following three questions", "the follow-up that you should ask yourself is, has he been asked this question more than ten times", "if the answer is yes, i would not start with that", "for instance, i know that \u2013 and i\u2019m drunk enough that i\u2019m going to get the details wrong here, but you can google it and figure it out \u2013 he is very involved or has been historically involved with race car driving", "i think he placed second place in the le mans race several years ago", "it could\u2019ve been five years ago, i don\u2019t know the exact timeline", "that may be something that he is very seldom asked about that he would be eager to or excited to talk about", "start with that", "given that opportunity to talk about something that he is interested in that very few people ask him about, that would then open the gate to questions that are perhaps more normal or standard", "does that make sense", "eric: yeah, that makes sense to me", "if you listen to, for instance, my interview with edward norton, we talked about surfing first", "that is a direct corollary to what i\u2019m suggesting", "because we were sitting on malibu pier, having lunch, drinking coffee, looking out at the surfing lineup and edward is a very dedicated surfer, so we talked about that first", "that was effectively the one to three rounds of limbering up, much like a boxing or thai boxing match within which we were able to just relax into answers that he could then deliver very honestly and sincerely", "but if you start with questions that he\u2019s been asked before, for instance, about ruby on rails, you\u2019re going to be one of a hundred other people who have done the same and he\u2019s \u2013 i don\u2019t want to speak for dhh \u2013 david, it\u2019s been a couple of years, but obviously i\u2019m a big fan of what he has done and what he does \u2013 but he will probably, just as i would do, go onto auto pilot, right", "so you want to be different before you are simply incrementally better is my suggestion in this particular case", "i\u2019ll add an unsolicited piece of feedback, since i\u2019m still sipping gin, gin and juice", "gin and juice, would you say that", "i\u2019m sorry", "i\u2019m looking at my cohort i shall not name at this moment", "it\u2019s not really gin and juice", "yeah, i\u2019m not really snoop dogg", "not quite snoop dogg", "he\u2019s got a leg up on me", "sorry, bear with me here", "i\u2019m enjoying my own drunken revelry", "bear with me", "eric: no worries", "you\u2019re still the most coherent drunk call that i\u2019ve ever heard", "what i was going to say is that you, for hardware, i would suggest a few things, and also logistics", "no", "1 is do it via skype or via zencastr or some telephonic means versus in person", "in person is more difficult to do for podcast", "the likelihood of you screwing something up technically or from a preparatory standpoint is much higher", "so i would use, in my case, skype, as i am right now", "i am using skype and ecamm call recorder", "although it\u2019s not necessarily right now, for many of my podcast guests, i will have evernote open with notes and questions, etc", "so that i am extremely prepared and able to respond to any twist in the conversation that might come up", "i would encourage you to start with some type of phoner, per se, because your likelihood of success is much higher", "if you\u2019re looking for, as i\u2019m using right now, a great bang-for-the-buck microphone, since i heard you ask", "you didn\u2019t ask, i\u2019m just joking", "but this is an atr2100 audio-technica mic", "atr2100", "that is probably $80.00, and it, for most folks, will do as good a job as the heil pr-40, i think it\u2019s called, which is a $500.00 mic", "this one costs $80.00 on amazon", "so this is what i use", "plus apple earbuds to remove echo", "i don\u2019t know why this works, but i do that it works", "to avoid any type of echoing effect or to minimize it, ear buds of some type are a very wise investment", "eric: awesome", "that\u2019s good to know", "i haven\u2019t really dived into looking for hardware yet", "so that\u2019s good to know what your pick is", "yeah, atr2100", "i use this for like 50 percent of my interviews", "it\u2019s cheap, relatively speaking, not too expensive", "i would give it a go", "so that is it, my friend", "i\u2019m going to bounce, but hopefully that is valuable in some capacity", "eric: yeah, it definitely was", "thank you so much, tim", "all right", "have a good weekend", "eric: you too", "bye", "[phone rings] hey, hey, hey", "it\u2019s tim ferris", "who\u2019s this", "vin: this is vin thomas", "vin thomas", "how the hell are you", "are you in the pacific northwest", "it would seem that way", "vin: yeah, i\u2019m in oregon", "good man", "god damn, oregonians are just owning this evening", "well, i am at your disposal, sir", "how can i help", "any questions", "any comments", "how may i be of assistance", "vin: man, you\u2019ve already been a ton of assistance to me", "i started my [inaudible] business right after [inaudible] the 4-hour workweek, so i was huge and now i own a small design company, started another company and i really attribute a lot of \u2013 i think back then what i learned from the 4-hour workweek, so i just appreciate that, man", "thank you", "well, good work", "congratulations", "vin: so let me see", "here\u2019s what i want to do", "i want to stop working as much and make more money", "you\u2019re kind of the king of that", "well, i can try", "i\u2019ve had a couple of gin tonics, so we will see how lucid my answers will be", "but yes, i can do my best", "i\u2019ll need a more specific question, but yes, i can take a stab at it", "vin: okay, so i have a design company", "we work mostly with start-ups and early-stage companies", "we just kind of reinvent the wheel every single time we approach a project and it just requires a lot of serious, hands-on hours", "i\u2019ve just been thinking through how can we streamline this process", "how can we make it easier", "i have two great developers who work for me who do an amazing job, but again, they have to absolutely hands-on the whole time", "we put a lot of hours in each project", "i know there\u2019s a better way to do it", "what are your off-the-cuff thoughts on how to improve the process", "what have you brainstormed so far", "vin: well, so i mean, a couple thoughts is hey, let\u2019s templatize a lot of this stuff", "instead of reinventing the wheel every time, let\u2019s templatize a lot of it", "maybe we can charge less per project, but it would take us significantly less time if we could do some of that", "we basically have these modules that we could piece together these websites", "we do a lot of marketing sites", "really, there\u2019s a lot of the same stuff: staff page, about page, tour, features, etc", "a lot of it is essentially the same, but we build it from scratch every single time, so that\u2019s something i think could help us", "but even beyond that, i think would could productize the service even more than that", "maybe us with an entirely different company", "okay", "so the first thought is you have clients respond in a templatized fashion", "meaning, they\u2019re filling out some type of questionnaire or a series of questions that will allow you to get 70, 80 percent of the work done without a lot of conference calls and other types of bandwidth-consuming activities", "the other option is to say that we offer a, b, and c and that is it, right", "in other words, to limit the scope of your operation so you specialize in one, two, or three things that you position yourself as being best at and you are then able to very sell yourself based on those strengths but nothing else", "i think those are a handful of approaches that come to mind offhand", "reading probably the e-myth revisited by michael gerber would be a good idea", "vin: yeah, for sure", "what are the current aspects of your business", "if you had to identify the 20 percent of activities that are creating 80 percent of your headache at the moment, what would those be", "vin: i\u2019m a designer so that\u2019s my role in the company", "i am the owner and the designer", "i enjoy that piece of the project", "what i don\u2019t enjoy as much is writing proposals, putting in however many hours of discovery before we can even kick off a project", "i understand that\u2019s part of what goes into being a good ui/ux designer, but man, some of that, the administrative stuff kills me", "i think the idea of templatizing, gathering that content could probably help", "i guess i wonder for our current clientele if they would go for that", "i think we might even have to branch off into either a subsection of our current business or even create a new business that would be more prone to that form of templatized approach", "i think it\u2019s an experiment worth running", "or a hypothesis worth disproving in the sense that it\u2019s something you could run for a handful of weeks to gather data and then make a more informed decision", "so it doesn\u2019t have to be an all or nothing bet", "it doesn\u2019t have to be a bet-the-farm-type decision", "in this case, where you can alternatively and simply, let\u2019s just say i\u2019m throwing this up, but split the traffic to your website 50/50", "50 is going to where it\u2019s always gone, 50 is going to some type of survey or templatized questionnaire, whereby you gather the most critical data you need in ten questions or fewer, and then you review the data accordingly", "so that would be my first knee-jerk response", "vin: the level of clients that come to us now would be so different than the level of client that would want a templatized service, right", "and so i don\u2019t know if that would work", "because people don\u2019t find us through seo", "they find us because someone told them about us", "i almost feel like that might be a weird experience for someone if they came directly expecting \u2013 we almost bill ourselves as your outsourced in-house design team", "we\u2019re there to handhold your project, hand hold it throughout the whole process", "so thinking back to the 4-hour workweek, do i start running experiments with tpc or ad words to see if people even want to buy this", "do i start a new, almost like a phony business, like whip something up in a weekend to see if people are going to bite", "well, i would say that at the top of the funnel, it is important to be aware of conflicting objectives, right", "so if you have an objective to be the bespoke customized solution for people who expect handholding from a to z, yet on the other hand you have the objective of minimizing the amount of time that you personally have to allocate to each client, you may have conflicting objectives", "vin: yeah, i agree", "right", "so in that case, no amount of massaging or fine-tuning in surgery is going to fix two primary objectives that conflict", "to that extent, i would say that it is probably worth testing for two to four weeks how people respond to a templatized approach", "because right now you have a set of assumptions, as we always do, every one of us myself included, have assumptions of how counterparts a, b, or c are going to respond to d, e, and f that i\u2019m going to put out in the world", "you just don\u2019t know at the end of the day", "so i would consider testing using unbounce or leadpages or another service or an in-house programming team", "50 percent of your traffic allocated to a templatized approach", "in fact, what you may find is that people disqualify or qualify themselves in such a way that allows you and them to spare an incredible amount of man hours because they\u2019ve either disqualified or qualified themselves in a much more efficient process", "so i would say that\u2019s probably how i would approach it is really as from the get go, we do not know, therefore we must test", "we\u2019re going to take two to four weeks to gather the data and then reassess what our results and objectives and process should be", "vin: sure, that\u2019s a great idea", "we have a new website that\u2019s about to launch \u2013 our personal website \u2013 so that would be something we could easily build in", "we could optimize or do something like that to assess what people like", "yeah, exactly", "vin: that\u2019s a good suggestion", "yeah, optimizely is a great suggestion", "i\u2019ve used them before as well", "i\u2019ll give you a current example for myself", "i am looking at developing a new site for tools of titans, my book that launches on december 6", "it\u2019s available for \u2013 vin: i\u2019m looking forward to it", "yeah, it\u2019ll be fun", "it\u2019s available for presale \u2013 wow, i am slurring like a motherfucker right now", "it\u2019s available for presale on amazon, but i am looking at the conversion effectiveness of fourhourbody.com (all spelled out) versus fourhourchef.com", "fourhourbody is much simpler", "designed by the same firm", "they\u2019re both by the same company", "digital telepathy in this case", "the fourhourchef is, i would say, more intricate, more complicated", "before i design the tools of titans website, i am determining which has converted most effectively", "there may be a number of tests that i have to run before we have a statistically significant number or set of data to work with to determine what the next step is for the design of toolsoftitans.com", "but that is going to come, right", "it\u2019s not that dissimilar from what you\u2019re running through right now", "i will probably end up split testing, at the very least, sort of a/b testing, two versions of the website", "it may be more than that", "i will look at, very concretely, which version of that website is resulting in the highest percentage per mil \u2013 right, of every thousand people who visit \u2013 what is producing the highest percentage of people who click on the button that i have determined is the most valuable click", "that could be a button to barnesandnoble.com", "it could be a button to amazon.com", "it could be a button, in your case, to ask for a quote", "it could be any number of things", "but determining what that most valuable click is and then testing multiple versions for it, particularly over a timespan of two to four weeks, is a very reasonable and non-threatening time period within which you can assess what is working and what isn\u2019t", "ultimately, when you look at \u2013 let\u2019s just say the people i\u2019ve had on the podcast, people who\u2019ve made hundreds of millions or billions of dollars \u2013 the one commonality or one of the few commonalities that they have is they are constantly testing their own assumptions", "they\u2019re asking themselves, how do i know what i think is best", "the answer is, you very seldom know", "you have to look at the numbers", "so that would be my very long-winded recommendation i think, at this point", "question for you, is vin your entire first name or is that short for something else", "i\u2019ve wondered this for a long time", "vin: so i go by vin, i\u2019ve gone by vin since i was a teenager", "but when i was younger, people would call me kev, and i hated that", "people would say, \u201chey, kev.\u201d i\u2019d say \u201cvin.\u201d because my name was kevin, right", "so then it just became vin", "i like it", "vin: i don\u2019t think [inaudible]", "i don\u2019t think most people who go by vin, not that there\u2019s a ton of them, are really named kevin", "there you have it", "i like it, all right, cool", "that\u2019s good to know", "all right, man", "hopefully that\u2019s helpful", "i\u2019m going to get a hop on things", "have a great weekend", "good luck", "vin: i appreciate it", "thanks, tim", "all right, man", "take it easy", "vin: okay, man", "bye", "bye", "[phone rings] ian: i\u2019m not available right now, but leave me your name and number and a detailed message and i\u2019ll get back to you as soon as i can", "hope to talk to you soon", "bye now", "ian, what happened", "this is tim ferriss", "i was hoping to wrap up with someone from south dakota but alas, that is not to be", "so on to the next number, i suppose", "have a glorious weekend", "[phone rings] chris, this is tim ferriss calling", "how are you", "chris: good", "tim, how are you", "i\u2019m great, i\u2019m great", "you are potentially the final conversation in my little drunk dialing escapade", "chris: the final conversation means you\u2019ve gotten pretty drunk, tim, huh", "i\u2019d say i\u2019m well above the threshold, yes", "where are you at the moment", "where is 520", "chris: 520 is tucson, arizona", "oh, nice", "arizona", "the land of extreme heat and extreme air conditioning", "chris: yeah, exactly", "it\u2019s actually pretty good weather out here tonight", "nice", "so i am all yours desponible for any questions or comments that you might have, so fire away", "i\u2019m all yours", "chris: currently, i\u2019m wondering about financial freedom", "a couple months ago, me and my girlfriend broke up because i felt like the drag of trying to \u2013 the rat race, i guess", "just kind of not worth it", "she was very much in that realm and i found a place where i didn\u2019t really agree with it", "i think that\u2019s kind of a place you\u2019ve been", "yeah, i\u2019ve been there before", "chris: i\u2019m trying to wonder how to take the steps forward in being able to be free of the whole corporate financial realm", "i don\u2019t exactly the way to put it to make more sense, but pressure i guess", "the pressure of the 401(k), the retirement, the big house, fancy car kind of stuff", "yeah, i think the first thought that comes to mind is really looking at your target monthly income and dissecting what the goal is in more precise terms", "so if you go to fourhourworkweek.com/tmi, that will give you some calculators and whatnot that you can use", "but i think the important or one of the important aspects is beginning within mind", "in this case, defining what your objective is first and foremost", "without that, it will be very difficult for you to calibrate and direct yourself in the right direction", "so i would begin with at least tentatively, it doesn\u2019t need to be a perfect or permanent decision, but deciding what your ideal lifestyle looks like in terms of how you spend your time, how you spend your resources, before you begin making any further decisions", "so that would be step 1", "really identifying what you want to have, what you want to do, what you want to be, over the next one to three years will provide you with at least an objective, something in the crosshairs to aim at while you make decisions", "so that would be step 1 is determining your target monthly income based on what you want to have, what you want to do, what you want to be, in very concrete terms", "beyond that, i would really turn the question around and ask you what you have found most helpful to date i suppose would be my approach", "chris: it was a couple years ago", "i work for a pharmaceutical company and so i actually have a lot of time at work to listen to podcasts", "a couple years ago, i found you and joe rogan", "i developed a real passion for it", "talk radio, podcast kind of stuff", "more than i\u2019ve really had a passion for anything", "i would love to get in that type of realm, but it\u2019s kind of a hard area to crack without having sort of niche to fall into", "so the average guy can\u2019t really start a podcast that people would actually listen to", "do you know what i mean", "well, yeah", "i agree that in the beginning no one is going to listen", "which is true for 99 out of 100 people who start podcasts", "chris: and podcasts are getting pretty popular", "yeah, they do", "but i would say that it\u2019s not too late to \u2013 whether it is start a podcast, start a blog, start a newsletter, fill in the blank", "i think the most important component of that or checkbox is identifying what you would be personally excited to do on a consistent basis because if you choose a podcast because it seems popular at the moment but you\u2019re not, in fact, excited about doing it, you\u2019re going to quit after the first few episodes", "there\u2019s just no two ways about it", "so i really think that following your excitement and dedication to a particular medium is more than choosing what is the medium du jour at that point in time, if that makes any sense", "chris: yeah, absolutely", "that was kind of my motivation", "i was in a long-term relationship and it just really didn\u2019t make sense in terms of my goals and that was my thing is i needed to follow what motivated me and podcasts and radio is that", "so i don\u2019t know what the first step is", "you have a great book but it\u2019s vague on first steps, you know", "where do i jump off from here, you know", "well, as it relates to podcasting specifically, that\u2019s a relatively new medium or industry compared to the 2007 publication date of the 4-hour workweek", "so first steps there are record six episodes and during that period of time determine, much like scott adams in my podcast with him, how you can make it a systems objective, as opposed to a goal-oriented objective", "meaning what can you learn through those six episodes of experimentation, even if your podcast ends up being listened to by no one", "when you think in those terms, you will cumulatively \u2013 chris: learn from experience", "exactly", "through the snowball effect of aiming for learning and network, i.e., what do i learn, who do i meet, who do i get to know", "develop a combination of factors that lead to success eventually, as opposed to a binary pass or fail", "so that would be my suggestion is thinking very carefully about if i try x for six episodes, if i try y for two months, how can i ensure this is a win over time, as opposed to a binary pass or fail", "i think that\u2019s very important, so that\u2019s how i would approach all of this", "chris: makes a lot of sense, yeah", "i guess the first step in jumping into anything is having the courage to jump into it, i guess", "yeah, it\u2019s really a matter of ready, fire, aim, as opposed to ready, aim, fire", "you kind of have to jump off the diving board and then figure out how you\u2019re going to end up headfirst diving into the water on the way down", "that isn\u2019t to say you should be haphazard, but if you only operate from a place of perfect information and complete information, you\u2019re never going to act at all", "this is where i think you can learn a lot from studying military operations is how to operate and make decisions from a place of incomplete information", "so i would say that in the case of podcasting at least, you need to get started before you can figure out 90% of the elements involved and commit to doing a minimum of say six episodes and that could vary from person to person, but in my case it was six episodes, so that you can maximize your learning curve in such a way that even if the podcast doesn\u2019t take, if people don\u2019t listen to it, you still gain far more from the experience than you give up in terms of time and resources", "chris: yeah, that makes a lot of sense", "all right, man", "well, i tell you what", "i\u2019ve got to get going", "i think i\u2019m starting to wane on the side of alcohol-infused energy", "chris: can i catch you for another 15 minutes to ask you some questions", "15 minutes", "maybe not", "but i can certainly give you a shout for a couple more minutes", "go for it", "chris: okay, so you were a very successful young man, are you still dating the same girl you\u2019ve been dating", "i am not dating the same girl that i\u2019ve been dating for five years or so", "i am in a new relationship", "so that is that", "next question", "chris: what do you find difficult about dating in your way of life", "what do i find difficult about dating in my way of life", "well \u2013 chris: in way of life, i mean that you\u2019re not a selfish person, but you have very personal goals and it\u2019s not in the sense of having a family \u2013 well, maybe it is, but you don\u2019t have relationship goals", "yeah, i mean, i would say that \u2013 chris: i don\u2019t mean to put words in your mouth", "no, it\u2019s fine", "i think that it comes down to finding someone who is complete in and of themselves", "in other words, someone who is low maintenance insomuch as they are comfortable in their own skin and they aren\u2019t desperate for finding someone else to make them a complete human being", "i think that you need to \u2013 or at least i need to \u2013 be with someone, spend time with someone, whether that is a friend or a girlfriend, for that matter, who i respect and admire in some capacity because if you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s really a short-term bet that it\u2019s going to ultimately, i think, self-implode in the long-term", "chris: do you think monogamy in the sense of human capability is rational", "do i think monogamy is rational", "i think that, as one of my very high-performing, close friends put it, who is a male, if you think about monogamy as a lifelong commitment, you will just end up slitting your wrists", "i think you should take it one day at a time", "i don\u2019t think that\u2019s a decision you necessarily have to make now or tomorrow or in the next three months", "i think that it\u2019s something that you can revisit \u2013 chris: in different scenarios", "\u2013 when needed in different scenarios", "i mean, i happen to think that monogamy is very hard for most human beings, based on what i\u2019ve seen", "but am i going to force myself to be non-monogamous when i\u2019m perfectly content", "no, i\u2019m not", "because it adds complexity to a life that is already sufficiently complex", "chris: having very apparent and first-hand values with someone would they kind of agree with this", "it\u2019s so hard to find but so important", "people kind of jump into stuff without really knowing anyone they jump into", "does that make sense", "it makes sense", "i also think that satisfaction or frustration is very related to setting expectations up front", "so if you have spoken to someone up front about the fact that you are in a place that in whatever capacity necessitates or leads you to feel that you are unsure of monogamy a, b, c, d, or e, whatever it might be", "as long as communicate that, you are being a fair player on the chessboard that relates to that relationship", "where people get themselves into particular trouble is they want to save that confession for a point where it\u2019s a dollar late and a dime too short and i think that is a precarious position to put yourself and your partner into", "so if you set the expectations up front, it doesn\u2019t mean that you will avoid all discomfort, but it puts you in a position where you can at least more rationally discuss things", "if you try to keep your darker side or less socially acceptable impulses in the shadows until the 11th hour, when you need to talk about it, then you\u2019re far more likely to have incredible difficulties and pain", "that\u2019s not to say that i\u2019m a relationship master", "look, i mean, i\u2019ve fucked up my fair number of relationships, as we all have", "but i do think that reading a book like lying by sam harris \u2013 a very short read \u2013 is very valuable for relationships of all types, including intimate ones for minimizing undue pain and suffering", "chris: we\u2019re also, like a lot of your listeners, actually all of your listeners, aren\u2019t tim ferriss either", "i mean, you have your demons just as much as we do, but you\u2019re still tim fucking ferriss", "i think people overestimate what being tim ferriss means", "i have as many demons that i am battling as anyone else", "it\u2019s important to realize that you may only be seeing the highlight reel of tim ferriss", "if you\u2019re watching the movie trailer of tim ferriss\u2019 life, you\u2019re going to be like, \u201cfuck, that\u2019s amazing", "that\u2019s fantastic", "i really want to be tim ferriss.\u201d but then you might watch the movie and you\u2019ll be like, \u201ci\u2019ll give that a fucking 67 on rotten tomatoes", "i\u2019m not up for that entire ride", "i think that half of it really doesn\u2019t apply to me.\u201d so it\u2019s important to realize that it\u2019s easy to put other people on a pedestal but everyone is swiss cheese", "we all have our holes", "i am not exempt from that in any capacity", "chris: i think you do really well with your blog posts, where i think maybe your initial one where you said, \u201ci\u2019m not perfect", "i masturbated last tuesday to whatever, and i\u2019m this person who has all the same mistakes that everyone else does", "i\u2019m not perfect, but i\u2019m trying to optimize my life", "i\u2019m trying to live the same \u2013 i\u2019m trying to be the best person that everyone else is trying to do,\u201d but you\u2019re doing it in a very systematic way, which is why i think you have so many people looking up to you", "we\u2019re all, i think, fighting a lot of the same battles", "i think that was the \u201cproductivity hacks for the neurotic, crazy and manic-depressive like me,\u201d i think that was the blog post", "i think it\u2019s important, as one of my podcast guests, sophia amoruso said, \u201cdon\u2019t be so impressed.\u201d look, i\u2019ve put in a lot of thought and a lot of good work into trying to improve myself and help others, but don\u2019t be so impressed", "no one knew who the hell i was before 2007", "there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t do ten times more than i can if you apply yourself and approach it in a systematic way", "look, at the end of the day, we\u2019re all dust and 100 years from now, i\u2019ll be very surprised if anyone fucking remembers who i am, if we\u2019re not all incinerated from some type of climate change", "but i think, at least for me, the objective is be a force for good", "don\u2019t procrastinate, don\u2019t bitch and moan on fucking twitter 24/7", "try to actually put a foot forth", "stick your neck out, risk getting criticized, and improve things because criticizing or vilifying one group by the way is not the same as helping every other group who might or may not need help, is a risky business", "if you actually want to improve the world, you are an exception", "i should actually take a step back and say, if you stick your neck out and try to improve the world, you are an exception", "most of the people in the world are happy to sit on the sidelines and criticize and be a peanut gallery and bullshit and throw stones, but if you want to be in the arena, the one guarantee is you\u2019re going to get a lot of black eyes and you\u2019re going to get a lot of bloody knees and very few people are going to fucking thank you for it", "that is a mantle that you choose to accept or you don\u2019t, but if you do, no", "1, kudos to you", "congratulations and thank you", "no", "2, don\u2019t expect everybody to pat you on the fucking back", "you\u2019re going to get a lot of shit", "that is just part and parcel of the whole arrangement unfortunately", "but that is as true now as it was 2,000 years ago in the age of seneca and marcus aurelias and everybody else", "human nature doesn\u2019t change a whole lot", "so that would be i suppose my sum up of the whole situation", "chris: agreed", "i [inaudible]", "even going back to socrates", "yeah", "it doesn\u2019t change all too much", "chris: so i think serial podcast listeners feel that podcasts you listen to every single day, they look at you guys as friends", "so i listen to you every day and you give me advice, same with joe rogan or any of the other people that i listen to", "we don\u2019t have a conversation, but i listen to it and i see them as friends", "then when you run into these people in real life, they look at you as one of their good friends who has helped them through hard situations, who is a person in their groom party when they get married", "what is that like when you run into those people", "when they look at you so on a \u2013 not necessarily a pedestal, but they look at you as like a family member and you see them as a total stranger who you have no relationship to", "is that strange", "is that nice", "it\u2019s both", "it\u2019s strange and nice and it\u2019s usually flattering", "i\u2019m not immune to being on the other side of the equation, in the sense that, for instance, in neil gaiman, i idolize in a lot of ways the writer, fiction writer primarily, and i\u2019ve met him once, sure", "but he doesn\u2019t know me", "when i met him, because i\u2019d heard his voice for dozens of hours, i\u2019m sure it was fucking weird and creepy on some level because i had such a level of familiarity with him, yet he had none with me necessarily", "that imbalance is something i\u2019ve become more comfortable with when i meet someone who has listened to my podcast for dozens of hours or hundreds of hours", "i am more ready to accept that and welcome it than i might have been a few years ago, because it is a little odd to have such a relationship where one person has 100 percent of the information and the other person has 1 or 2 percent of the information, at best", "it is a little odd but that doesn\u2019t make it bad; odd doesn\u2019t equal bad", "for me, i\u2019ve just taken that as an opportunity when i talk to people, whether it\u2019s you or someone else, to try to explore more of what they\u2019ve experienced so that i can correct that imbalance of information, if that makes any sense", "but it\u2019s not a bad thing", "of all the problems to have in the world, this is a good problem to have", "so i certainly try not to complain", "chris: i think with any conversation, it\u2019s tough to get to the core of someone, but when you meet someone who\u2019s listened to you for so many years, you\u2019ve already cut to the core then", "so if you really want to talk to them, they\u2019re willing to spill their guts to you or anyone, you know what i mean", "so you\u2019ve already cut through a lot of that core with a lot of people who listen to you for so many years", "that\u2019s really cool", "well, i appreciate that", "on top of that, when people sometimes approach me \u2013 let\u2019s say they meet me at a book signing or something like that and they say, \u201cwell, i know we don\u2019t know each other but,\u201d and i want to say, \u201cif you\u2019ve listened to dozens or 100+ of my podcast, you actually do know me pretty well", "chris: yeah, you\u2019re very good at that", "it\u2019s not an illusion", "you really have spent a lot of time with me", "you actually know me extremely well", "i mean, better than some people who consider themselves my close friends", "so that\u2019s perhaps an unusual side effect, but a beneficial one and i think it\u2019s an interesting one at the very least, of this type of new media relationship", "you can know someone better that some of their close friends know them by virtue of the fact of being exposed to them for dozens or hundreds of hours", "so it\u2019s something that i try to look at as an incredible opportunity, as opposed to anything strange", "they\u2019re not mutually exclusive", "you can have incredibly interesting, incredible opportunities that are simultaneously somewhat odd and very strange", "that\u2019s what i would say", "chris: absolutely", "i think that was my love of podcasts is that a lot of people just have real conversations", "then when i got out and talk to my friends and everyone\u2019s so hesitant \u2013 or talking to co-workers, everyone has a face they want to put out", "it\u2019s hard", "listening to podcasts and people actually have real conversations", "when you have fake ones, it just doesn\u2019t matter as much", "it\u2019s hard to break through strangers or friends when everyone has their guard up", "yeah, well, you know, i think that podcasters you have to realize at a certain point are also professionals", "so it\u2019s not fair to hold strangers to the same standard where in japanese, for instance, or in japan, both, they talk about ho ne, which is how you behave, your core of who you are, versus ta tai mai", "ta tai mai is like what you put forward", "they even talk about stranger formality [speaking japanese], where you put that forward", "so this is not unique to japanese", "it\u2019s also found in every english-speaking culture and everywhere else", "so i think that podcasting is an opportunity to not only listen and consume, but develop your own abilities of question asking and empathy that can aid you in your conversation with anyone, not just those who are related to the itunes universe or otherwise", "tell you what man, i\u2019ve got to run", "i\u2019m going to grab some more exogenous ketones, maybe some more gin", "but i think i got to pull this to a close", "chris: all right, man", "i appreciate the phone call", "it was a pleasure talking to you", "likewise", "take it easy, bye"]}
