This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to distill, extract, deconstruct the habits, routines, and tactics of world-class performers of all different types, whether they are billionaires, chess prodigies, elite athletes, or otherwise. And in this case, we have elite athlete Maria Sharapova. And man, oh, man did I have a lot of fun with this conversation. We got deep into the tactics of training and mental performance, mental toughness, and much, much more. You can find her on Facebook, Sharapova. You can find her on Twitter and Instagram, @mariasharapova. Who is Maria Sharapova? She is the winner of five Grand Slam titles and is an Olympic silver medalist. She is only one of a handful of players to hold all four Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon, US Open, Australian Open, and Roland-Garros. She has held the world No. 1 ranking for 21 weeks and has won 35 singles titles in her career. Forbes also named her the highest-paid female athlete of all time in 2005. She\u2019s now held that title for a record 11 or 12 years. That is a long time. Maria garners worldwide press coverage on and off the court with a social media presence that includes 15.5 million \u2013 probably a lot more at this point \u2013 Facebook fans, more than 6.5 million, 2.7 million followers on Instagram. She serves as an ambassador to many of the world\u2019s top luxury brands and a number of Fortune 500 companies, including Porsche, Nike, Avian, and Head. In 2007, she became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Program, that\u2019s UNDP, and has made significant contributions to Chernobyl-related projects in her native country. In 2012, Sharapova flexed her entrepreneurial muscles and debuted her eponymous couture candy collection Sugarpova. Most recently, she is the author of a book titled Unstoppable, My Life So Far. It describes her story in detail and was done in collaboration with an incredible writer named Rich Cohen, which we\u2019ll get into. But a few things that we don\u2019t get into. We don\u2019t talk about meldonium. We don\u2019t talk about the sponsors. We don\u2019t talk about a handful of things that have been talked to death in the media. We dig into more of the specifics that you can use, the specifics that will inspire you and also instruct you that you can apply. So that was the focus. And I really hope you enjoy this as much as I did. It was a blast, and it inspired me, in fact, among other things, to come to Florida where I am right now. I have a compression sleeve on my right arm. Why? Because I\u2019m doing tennis camp. I\u2019m doing an intense, immersive tennis program at the Human Performance Institute with Jim Loehr. And you should definitely check out the Human Performance Institute with Jim Loehr. It\u2019s phenomenal. And I\u2019ve been playing my little heart out in tennis, which I have always wanted to do my entire life, for the last two days, and I have a few more days to go. But Maria really piqued my interest in this sport, which I had wanted to do for so, so long and put off. And I realized rather than doing jujitsu and all of these things that break my body, the gentle art, maybe I should try something like tennis. Golf? Not my speed. I\u2019d rather just go for a hike. But tennis, yeah, I like the sound of that. And I like watching it. So even if just to get a better appreciation of the sports that I can see the nuances and details when watching on tennis on TV \u2013 tennish said Sean Connery\u2026all right, I need to go have a drink and dinner. In any case, without further ado, please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation with Maria Sharapova. Maria, welcome to the show. Maria Sharapova: Thank you. Tim Ferriss: I am so thrilled that we were able to carve out time. And I have so many questions. I will start with a rather simple one. I\u2019m sitting here drinking tea. I\u2019m having Charleston Breakfast Tea, and I have heard that you also enjoy tea. Is that true, and if so, what type of tea do you prefer. What are your go-to teas? Maria Sharapova: I do. So I grew up in Russia where tea, it\u2019s a big part of our culture is drinking tea in the afternoons with your grandparents. So I drank black tea, a Darjeeling type of tea that was made in the mountains in Siberia. And I would have it with raspberry jam that my grandmother would make. Tim Ferriss: That sounds amazing. So would you put the jam on a piece of toast and have it, or \u2013 Maria Sharapova: No, I, actually, put it in my tea. And I still do that. And people look at me very strangely and suspiciously. And I get it. But it\u2019s just so many memories of my childhood. And, yeah, I do that instead of sugar, which is pretty much the same thing. Tim Ferriss: But it allows you \u2013 Maria Sharapova: It\u2019s a little messier. Tim Ferriss: It gives you permission. And you mentioned Siberia, which is where I want to go next. You were born in Siberia, as I understand it, but your mother was pregnant with you while in Chernobyl. Maria Sharapova: Right. Tim Ferriss: So could you explain what happened exactly? Maria Sharapova: My parents were from Gomel. It was a very small town very close to where the Chernobyl reactor blew up. And during that time, just before my mother was pregnant with me, in 1986 and they fled. There was not a lot of information about what happened during Chernobyl. My grandparents were living in Siberia at that time from my mom\u2019s side. And they said, \u2018You need to get out of there.\u2019 They were able to get more information about the disaster itself than my parents were able to get to being so close to the area. And they left. And that\u2019s why I was born in Siberia. Tim Ferriss: Your family fled to, I guess, Russia right after the explosion. But you ended up in, I guess, a warmer place, at least depending on the season. Maria Sharapova: Yes. Much warmer. When we were about 2, my parents realized, \u2018This is not going to work out over here.\u2019 And they moved to a resort town, Sochi, where they just had the winter Olympics. And I still consider it one of the most beautiful places to visit because you have the Black Sea, and you have the palm trees in the summer. And just an hour away, you have these mountains where the Olympics were held and some of the best skiing in the world. My dad still skis there all of the time. So yeah, I definitely \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most peaceful places as well. Tim Ferriss: If I go to Russia \u2013 I\u2019ve never visited Russia; I\u2019ve always wanted to \u2013 are there one or two places that I absolutely must visit, in your mind? Are there any particular things that I cannot miss? I know it\u2019s a gigantic place. Maria Sharapova: Right. I would say skip Siberia, and there\u2019s definitely not much to see or do over there. But I think, from a cultural standpoint, I would definitely visit St. Petersburg. And it is still a place that I\u2019ve never been to, if you can believe it or not, as much as I\u2019ve traveled around the world. But my mom goes almost every year. A lot of my relatives are there. And I just have this enormous respect for the culture and just the city and the people and the way they live. It\u2019s very different. And people always ask me because I was born in Russia, and I spent the first seven years of my life there, and I\u2019ve lived in the United States ever since, and I\u2019ve never really looked back into living in Russia. But so much of my heart still remains there. Obviously, all of my grandparents and my cousins also live there. And so it\u2019s a very big part of my life. And when people ask me what I think about the country, as much as I want to have an opinion, it is so large, and it is so vast, and there are so many opinions you can have about it. And I really just want to let people experience it on their own and come to their own conclusions because I think that\u2019s one of the greatest things of travel is to not have expectations and to get there and to experience a new place. But St. Petersburg is on my list, and that\u2019s definitely a city that comes highly recommended. Tim Ferriss: Why have you not been there? And maybe it\u2019s something like me growing up in New York, I had never, ever visited the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty until a friend from Germany visited. Is it like that? Or is there another reason? Maria Sharapova: It\u2019s because of my schedule. I compete 10 months out of the year, and I pretty much go to the same cities every year because the tournaments are all situated in those same cities. When I have a holiday break, which usually consists of a couple of weeks only in November, I go somewhere warm. I just escape. I put my phone away. I put just everything on hold a little bit and just let my body and my mind recover. And it just never has come into my schedule. Tim Ferriss: Warmer places, we talked about a few, and, of course, there\u2019s California, there\u2019s Florida, and then, there\u2019s Sochi. So, going back to Sochi, is that where you were first noticed? Maria Sharapova: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Can you tell the story of how you were first found, as it were, as it relates to tennis? Maria Sharapova: Yeah. So Sochi, in the summer, it was very much a happening place. It was a scene, and it was a lot of people were coming there on vacation. So we had a lot of little parks and outdoor tennis courts and Ferris wheels and all of these types of attractions. And my father \u2013 who was not a great athlete but he played hockey in school \u2013 he enjoyed playing tennis. He was not very good at all, did it for fun. And when I was old enough to go with him \u2013 and my mother had me when she was very young. She was only 20 years old, so she was still studying at the time. So on weekdays when my father didn\u2019t have to work, he would take me with him to the local park. And I would just follow along. And we\u2019d take the public bus to the courts. And I\u2019d just sit there, and I\u2019d watch him grind it out with a competitor of his. And then, I\u2019d see all of these little kids playing on the side. And they were just hitting balls against the wall. And I didn\u2019t have a racket of my own. And the one that I was able to get was so much bigger than myself. So that didn\u2019t really work out. But I \u2013 immediately something drew me to it. Something drew me to this like repetitiveness of seeing these kids try to hit the ball against the strings of the racket and see it come back from the wall. And it was very fascinating. It was like I had this immediate feeling of, I want to be in front of those kids, and I want to show them how it\u2019s done. Even though I had no idea what I was doing. So I think that competitiveness kind of developed then where I was just sitting and bored and watching my father play. I just wanted to be out there. Tim Ferriss: Was it a feeling that you could do it more correctly and just something that you intuited that you felt intuitively? Or was it because you noticed flaws in their technique or things that they were missing? I\u2019m always curious about this because one of my closest friends, his name is Josh Waitzkin, and the book and the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer were based on him. He\u2019s thought of as a chess prodigy. And he had this experience very, very early on with chess. Of course, it might be difficult to recall what was going through your head at the time, but can you elaborate at all? Maria Sharapova: I think, from my perspective, when you\u2019re that young, and when you don\u2019t know anything about that particular activity or that sport, and it was tennis in that moment, it was really this question of, can I do that? I see all of these kids doing it. Do I have the ability to be better than them? And after observing so much of what my father was doing just not on any professional level at all, it just came to my mind that I wanted to do it. And I wanted to do it better. I think there are times in life where things come instinctually, and you just grasp it, and you notice it. And I think my father definitely noticed. I could have kept sitting on that bench, and I could have kept watching my father. But there was something in me that said no, I want to be out there. I want to be playing, and I want to be competing. And I want to be learning. And when I got myself out to the wall where all of the kids were hitting the ball against, I remember a coach, there was one coach there, and all of the children were going to see him. All of the parents wanted him to tell them that they\u2019re going to be future stars. They\u2019re going to be the next Pete Sampras or the next Andre Agassi. And he noticed me and only after a couple of weeks of when I was playing. And he pulled my father aside and said, \u201cThis girl can play tennis.\u201d And after that, I started taking lessons with him. And a couple of years after that, there was an exhibition that Martina Navratilova was a part of. And I was about 5 1/2 years old at that time, and the exhibition was being held in Moscow. So my father and I went to Moscow. And I was probably one out of 200 kids in that clinic that she was holding for these kids. And after hitting a few balls, I noticed that she had come up to my father. And I don\u2019t quite know in what language they spoke because my father didn\u2019t speak any English, and I\u2019m pretty sure she didn\u2019t have much Russian. But between the two and after she left, I spoke to my father, and he said, \u201cThis legend, Martina Navratilova, just came up to me and said that you\u2019re talented.\u201d And this was only after her watching me just hit a couple of balls in the midst of so many other kids. And I look back at that because I see so many kids now. I practice at a country club, and there are all of these \u2013 just today, I was practicing next to two little girls that are probably 7 or 8 years old just enjoying the game by themselves and trying to hit the ball over the net. And it\u2019s hard to envision that talent. It\u2019s hard to see it. So for her to be able to see that when I was only 5 1/2 years old is pretty incredible. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any idea, have either of the first coach or Martina later told you what they saw? Have you any idea of what it was that they picked up on? Maria Sharapova: I haven\u2019t spoken to Martina about it too much. But the first coach that I had in Sochi when I just started playing, he, unfortunately, passed away a few years ago. But I definitely had this tenacity. And I had this will of focus at a young age. And tennis is a very repetitive sport. So it\u2019s grinding. It\u2019s just hitting the ball. And when you\u2019re that young, your concentration and focus is just all over the place. You play with the ball for a few minutes, and then you want to play with a truck, or you want to play with a doll. And the consistency in your mind is very limited, at least that\u2019s what, when I observe kids, which is completely normal. But I had this fascination with being able to hit the ball and seeing somebody else hit it back at me and trying to find a way \u2013 and the racket that I first had, we had to cut the grip by like 4 or 5 inches because it was so much bigger than I was. And I could barely hold it, and it was so heavy. So it\u2019s just this really funny scene of me trying to figure out how to \u2013 because, when you\u2019re just given a ball and a racket, well, what do I do with this now? So I just picture myself there just trying to find a way to get the ball over the net. And I had this determination of doing it better and better every day. And I stuck to it. It was never \u2013 I don\u2019t remember one day where I didn\u2019t want to go down the steps of our apartment and walk the 20 minutes uphill to get to the bus station and then have to change buses at the next station. There was never a day when I said I don\u2019t want to do it. And I think that\u2019s not something that you can really teach or that you could develop it, but I think I just really loved it. And I carry that passion. Tim Ferriss: This idea that you were able to hold constant in your mind, this fascination of tennis and practice consistently, what did your \u2013 as context for myself, what did your dad do for work? And you mentioned your mother was studying, what was she studying? If you could tell us a little bit about them. Maria Sharapova: She was studying communications and business. And I had a very interesting childhood because my parents were very young, and they had no knowledge of what to do. I was the first child. I\u2019m still the only child. But they were very careful of what the decisions that they made and where I was going to go and if I was going to go to kindergarten or how long they wanted me to be there. And I spent so many hours in the library with my mother while she was doing her homework. Or she was studying for an exam, and I\u2019d go with my father when he would leisurely play tennis. My father worked in construction. He had a fairly normal job. I would say we were an average family getting support from both of our grandparents, from my mom\u2019s and my dad\u2019s side. And we lived a very basic and, at that time, a very normal life. Tim Ferriss: Did they expose you to a lot of other things tennis? And some things you had zero interest in, and you had that kid-like distraction or ADHD-like inability to focus or jumpy focus, and then, tennis was the one thing that you gravitated toward and really locked onto? Or were you like that with everything? Maria Sharapova: Well, it happened so fast. And because I had only started picking up the tennis racket when I was 4 years old, at the age of 6 1/2, I was already on an air flight to America. Tim Ferriss: Right. You didn\u2019t have a lot of time to test things out. Maria Sharapova: There wasn\u2019t much time to really test other things. I loved to play with dolls. I loved to play doctor. I loved to read. My mother was very much into education. And she didn\u2019t want anything to do with tennis. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with sports. She danced ballet a little bit. And she brought a lot of cultural, educational, the learning and the growing-in-your-mind experiences to me. She would read passages and novels that I was way too young to understand. But she made me memorize a lot of those passages. And something about that, that repetitiveness, I never liked to do it. But it was a sense of discipline that she taught me in a way that had nothing to do with sport. And I think that really \u2013 I would spend an hour in the evening just memorizing these poems by Pushkin and thinking to myself, When am I ever going to use this? And little do you know, with years, especially now that I\u2019m older, discipline doesn\u2019t always come so easy. You have to build its foundations, and you have to build the trust with the people that help you with it. And I think her influence and her ability to acknowledge that as a young mom was so inspirational. And that discipline really comes into play as a tennis player because you have to have so much of it. There\u2019s sacrifice, and there are the long days. But the discipline that you have to carry on with, whether it\u2019s a good day or a bad day, just beats everything else. Tim Ferriss: So I got chills about 47 seconds ago because I\u2019m looking at the time because I found what I was digging for. And I wasn\u2019t looking for any particular answer, but I want to just underscore a few things that you said for people who might be parents because, of the 250-plus interviews that I\u2019ve done for this podcast, there are a couple of patterns that have emerged in people who have become really, really good at something really early. And, ultimately, you\u2019ve really mastered anything, even for that age, 10 or 15, 20. So the first is that I\u2019ve noticed, and it\u2019s not for everyone, but their parents talk to them, at least part of the time, about subject matter above their heads, so to speak, or as adults. And No. 2 is a lot of exposure to books. No. 3 was what you brought up, and this was what I got excited about, which is developing a tolerance for repetition. And, in some cases, for that type of, I\u2019m not going to say boredom, but lack of variety in some capacity because I think that, like you said, you\u2019re training that so that it can then be applied to other things. So you might say, \u201cWhy am I memorizing these poems? I\u2019m never going to use these poems.\u201d But, at the same time, you\u2019re developing the ability to tolerate the thousands of hours that you\u2019re going to put into hitting a ball against a wall. Maria Sharapova: Yes. And it\u2019s the persistence that you\u2019re building. It\u2019s the will that when \u2013 I mean, I believe in any job that we do, any work that we have in front of us, there are a lot of moments that we look forward to. There are projects that we love and that we want to be a part of. But then, there\u2019s the tedious work. There\u2019s the things that \u2013 the repetition as a tennis player where you have to just \u2013 where it\u2019s all numbers, and where it\u2019s just a feeling that you get to a certain number, and you just feel it, and you let go, and you don\u2019t think. And that\u2019s time. And you could say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it. I want to stop. I don\u2019t want you feeding me anymore balls.\u201d But that mental persistence, I do think you can develop early. I certainly was able to with the help of my mother. And also when you\u2019re young \u2013 she was a very young parent. And with the help of her mother and also culturally, I would say, 30 years ago or 25 years ago, it was very different. And I felt like I was in her cocoon, and I was growing up in her hands, which also I think explains the bond that we have today and the friendship we were able to have from that. And I think that\u2019s one of the most important things in my life as I travel around the world today, and I meet a lot of young girls and boys, whether they play tennis or not, and I hear their stories. And so much of their experience is a very tough and rough childhood where they almost want to escape from what they knew as their family. And it\u2019s so sad, personally, because the experience that I had in my childhood and it was not \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it was all butterflies and rainbows. But as I look back at that experience and how they were handling that situation and how they were sacrificing so much for myself created this bond within my family that was very important. And it\u2019s priceless. And I know that those are not the people that we are able to choose in our life. But they are the people that know us the best. And that relationship can do so many wonders in your life. Tim Ferriss: Because I feel like your mom is such an important figure and relationship, I noticed that you\u2019ve been reading memoirs written by women. And feel free to correct anything that I get wrong. But, most notably, Love Warrior by Glennon Doyle Melton and Jeannette Walls\u2019s The Glass Castle. And you called them \u201cvery strong, tough, emotional books.\u201d What did those two books mean to you? Why were they tough and emotional? What did you take away from that? Maria Sharapova: I get very inspired by women. I get very inspired by their brain, by their actions, by their toughness. I think, in today\u2019s world, and in today\u2019s working environment, and I face this a lot in my sport where I could be going into a press conference six times in a week, and I\u2019m faced with equality questions. And you almost have your back against the wall so many times, and you have to explain yourself, and you feel that you\u2019ve done it so many times. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain that just for a second in terms of explaining yourself for equality questions? Would you tell us a little bit more about that? Maria Sharapova: Equality has been a big subject in women\u2019s tennis for many, many years. And Venus Williams and Serena herself have done an incredible job of getting to where we are today with the help of the pioneer, Billie Jean King, was the reason why we make such an incredible living from what we do. And the one thing that we as professional athletes have to realize is we\u2019re not only fighting to win a tennis match. We\u2019re also fighting to be an example. We\u2019re fighting for our voice. We\u2019re fighting to have a pedestal to create that pedestal and to raise awareness of how incredible and how difficult and how each path is so unique and personal and how we\u2019re all able to come through it. How we are able to share our stories, how we\u2019re able to inspire other people, and not just women. It\u2019s women and men as well. Do we get enough credit for it? I don\u2019t believe so. And when I say that that\u2019s what we have to explain, I believe that\u2019s the feeling that I have, at least. And I don\u2019t feel that we have the amount of support that we should be having. Tim Ferriss: I was having a conversation with a very learned man \u2013 I guess would be the easiest way to put it today \u2013 and asking him for advice on a few things. And he said that to help the greatest number of people, become an example. In other words, you don\u2019t have to work hand-in-hand with each individual person. But if you have the visibility and exposure, as you do, to become an example of potential, I think that\u2019s extremely important. But it had very unusual beginnings, all of this, in many respects, right? And you ended up, at a very young age, at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in the US, which has produced, you mentioned, the William sisters, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker. How did you end up there? And could you tell us a bit about the coaching methodology because that\u2019s always what I\u2019m just so endlessly fascinated by? Maria Sharapova: So I think my father\u2019s point of view after that children\u2019s clinic that Martina Navratilova held was: Tennis is not a big sport, at that time, in Russia. We didn\u2019t have many champions coming out of the country. I believe, at the time, it was Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Anna Kournikova. But, other than that, it was hockey. It was figure skating. It was all of the winter Olympic sports. And one, it was very expensive to find the right coaches, to find the right facilities, especially in the winter time. So the only real option was America. And my father started reading books and studying the game. And he knew that he wasn\u2019t a tennis coach. And he knew that he was a great tennis player. And one of the biggest gifts that my father gave me, and it started from a very young age, was that he realized that he wasn\u2019t the one that was going to be my main coach. He wasn\u2019t the one that knew everything or believed to know everything. He wanted to get the help from others. And so he started doing research. And the next thing I knew, just before my seventh birthday, I was on a flight to Miami, Florida. And from there, we made this crazy bus journey, four hours north, to the Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Florida, which has, as you just mentioned, so many of the stars, past and present and future, at the moment. It\u2019s really a factory. This tennis factory that\u2019s grown into other sports as well. But, at the time, it was very tennis-specific. And Nick Bollettieri was someone that came with a lot of experience and coaching experience. And he, as a person, was a mentor to me more than anything with the guidance, with this experience of seeing so many people come in and out; so many people come in wanting to be champions turned into good. Some people come in, and they turn into great, and some just turn into champions. And he\u2019s seen it all. So knocking at the door of Nick Bollettieri Academy in the dead of the night was probably one of the toughest moments in that journey. And it really began there. And they told us it was a little too late or a little too early to be knocking at an academy door, so they sent us to a hotel, and we ended up coming back in the morning. And they put me in a group of kids with probably six or seven kids and an instructor watched me hit a few balls and called over Nick Bollettieri and said, \u201cYou have to see this girl play.\u201d And then, Nick saw me play, and that\u2019s kind of where it took off. Tim Ferriss: And what makes that place so special? And I ask because I always wonder, in the beginning, there must have been something special in the sauce because there comes a point where the best in the world gravitate to your center, if you\u2019ve produced a lot of champions. So then, there\u2019s a question of is it created, or is it sort of a selection bias? But what makes that place unique in terms of training, in terms of principles, or anything that makes it stand apart? Maria Sharapova: Yeah. That\u2019s a great question because I see it in two different ways. And from a positive view, I saw it, and I still see it as, first of all, it\u2019s located in a place where there\u2019s nothing else to do. So you are going there to be committed to become a tennis player or another sport that you might be practicing over there. You have no distractions. The second greatest thing about it is the amount of kids that were there that were older than I was against whom I was able to compete. And so every afternoon, six days a week, I would play matches against them, and I would play sets. And it was the best learning experience because creating that understanding what you do and who you are as a tennis player and those mechanics, the basics, the mind, the brain of setting up the next shot before you even hit it, that knowledge you get by playing. And so I had this opportunity. I\u2019d play a kid from China. I\u2019d play a kid from Europe that I was most likely \u2013 not most likely, I was one of the youngest ones at the academy. At one point, I wasn\u2019t even allowed to board there because I was so young. And so I had this incredible experience of coming, in terms of competition, of seeing someone across the net that was 2 feet higher than I was, that was stronger than I was. And I had to figure out how to beat them if I wanted to have my self-esteem or be confident or be a better player. And the other great thing was that Nick himself, he knew what to say, and he knew when to say it. And I think you can be a great coach. And I\u2019ve had many throughout my career. But they\u2019re not very good business people. And Nick understood that you only need just a handful, maybe a couple or a few players that could really make the academy what it is. And I boarded with eight other girls for a long period of time. And they weren\u2019t excited to be there. They knew that that wasn\u2019t their future. They sometimes didn\u2019t even know if that was their college future. But the money that was going into that academy because of why they were there and practicing and competing was the reason why Nick Bollettieri was so smart. And when you needed him, he was there. At 5 a.m., he\u2019s there on the court. He\u2019s the one that locks the place until this day. And that dedication and that love and passion for what you do, it\u2019s incredible. I just saw him a few months ago. I spent a few weeks there training part of my comeback. And he was out every single day. He\u2019d come out for a few minutes. He\u2019d sit down next to me. He\u2019d speak to me like I was 10 years old again, and he\u2019s the same Nick as he was. It\u2019s so rare \u2013 it\u2019s really rare to see that. And I go there for the same reasons. I go there because of the atmosphere, because you see other athletes. And it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re in college, if they\u2019re young, if they\u2019re not going to make it. Just to be in the environment of everyone training with a purpose, it makes you better. It makes you \u2013 I love playing in front of a little crowd would kind of get around the court that I was practicing on. And since I hadn\u2019t been in competition for a long period of time, it was so great to have people huddle around the court and watch my every move. And I felt that adrenaline again because, usually, in between tournaments, I like to practice where it\u2019s a little bit more private and quiet because, at a tournament, it\u2019s a zoo. I always compare it to being in a cage of a zoo where everyone is around you and taking your picture. And there\u2019s sort of no escape until someone just takes you out on a golf cart and away you go. And so when I\u2019m home, whether it\u2019s in Florida or California, I just love the stillness and the quietness of just being on my own. I don\u2019t have a court, but I go to a country club, and I practice on a corner. Or I train at a private court as well and just have your peace and quiet a little bit just to have your mind only see your team and the members of your team and then do your work and leave. But being there for that period of time has brought back so many memories. Tim Ferriss: So a few things. One, Nick, I\u2019m sorry, I always mispronounce your name anytime I try to say it. I think part of my spirit wants to be Italian, so I try to really throw a spin on it and say \u2013 but I always make that mistake. Maria Sharapova: He would love that if you said Bollettieri, he would love that. He goes to this little, Italian restaurant every single day of the week, so he would absolutely appreciate that. Tim Ferriss: Oh, fantastic. Well, then, you\u2019re welcome, Nick, not I\u2019m sorry. And the next question is related to your experience early on. You mentioned that you had these giants across the net. Meanwhile, you\u2019re this tiny kid holding this gigantic broadsword, basically, because it\u2019s so big compared to your body. I\u2019ve heard that you had some experience being teased when you arrived in the US. Maria Sharapova: Yes. Tim Ferriss: And I\u2019d love to hear you talk about that if any particular examples come to mind and just talk about what effect it had on you. Because what I have just been, mesmerized might sound weird, so don\u2019t take it as being creepy, but just focused on when I watch you play and compete is just the toughness. And you mentioned the grinding and just the toughness that I see is something that I\u2019d like to explore. So could you talk about the teasing when you got the US? Maria Sharapova: I very much felt like I was an outcast from the beginning. And one of the reasons was because I had arrived in America with my father. And our story just didn\u2019t make sense to anyone. So from the very beginning, everyone just assumed we were crazy, which, if I look at that now, yes, we were absolutely. My parents\u2019 decision was crazy, the fact that we come to America, and you have this 7-year-old girl with a dream to become a tennis player. That\u2019s never going to work out. And so I sensed that. I felt that. I felt that I was different. I always felt like I was there on a different mission. And because I was one of the youngest ones, I never had the same interests as the other girls. And I always knew that my interest and my passion was very different to theirs. And while I boarded, at the academy, I remember coming back from practice, and my little locker would be open. And the only thing I had in that locker was this giant jar of little animal crackers. Tim Ferriss: The fuel of champions. Maria Sharapova: Right. Which by the diet these days has changed tremendously. I don\u2019t even know where to look when a new diet is coming out next. But, back then, I just remember that giant jar of animal crackers that I believe a friend from the academy gave me for my birthday. And that\u2019s the only thing that I had in that locker. I didn\u2019t have many belongings. I didn\u2019t have a lot of outfits or skirts that the girls had. I didn\u2019t really have anyone to do my hair or braid my hair. My father would sit me down on a chair and just cut my bangs straight across. They never looked great, obviously. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing. So I was always a little off. I didn\u2019t speak English, in the beginning. I was learning through just speaking with all of the other kids because they talked so much. You just pick it up, and you learn. And it just made me feel very much alone. It was not that I didn\u2019t have \u2013 it felt like I had a lot in common because we were all there to play tennis. But the mission that I was on, and I felt like I was, was very different. And it wasn\u2019t that I had to be a champion or I didn\u2019t have to be a champion. It was that I was learning, and I was growing to be a better tennis player. And I didn\u2019t know where that would take me, but I knew that, in order to get there, I had to wake up at 6 a.m., and I had to practice for the day. And then, I would take a 30 minute nap from 12 to 12:30. And, at 1 p.m., I\u2019d be back playing matches and sets until 4 or 5. And then, I\u2019d have a little bit of homework, and then, I\u2019d have to do it again. And so there was a lot of other interests that the girls had and posters and glitter and pictures and David Hasselhoff and Janet Jackson. And I had no clue who anyone of those was, at the time. And so I was just a stranger. I was sort of in my own little bubble from a very young age. And I look back on those moments, and I\u2019ve gotten that question a lot like, \u201cHow did you feel. Did you feel lonely?\u201d And one of the other things was that I didn\u2019t go to America with my mother because she didn\u2019t have a visa, so I spent the first two years in America without seeing my mom at all. And I look back at that time, and there\u2019s nothing about it that \u2013 it\u2019s sad. Obviously, it was very sad to not have that support and not have your mother cut your bangs and stuff instead of your father or him buy you shoes that are so ugly, and you don\u2019t know how to tell him. But he doesn\u2019t have enough money to buy you a better pair, so you just keep your mouth shut. It didn\u2019t feel like we were doing the wrong thing. I felt like I was on this path that I was meant to be on. And I didn\u2019t feel lonely. I didn\u2019t feel sad. It was a lonely time because, I look at that, and of course I was an outcast. But when you\u2019re on a mission to do something or be something, and it\u2019s not so much about success. I think it\u2019s just we always think of having a vision. And, of course, we have goals, and we plant it in our minds. But I never remember one time where my father told me that I have to win Wimbledon or that I had to win the US Open. He never made me feel that, if I didn\u2019t, that the world would end. And I always remember thinking that, if this doesn\u2019t work out, and we would go to Russia and that\u2019s absolutely fine because I felt like I had a completely normal childhood when I was living there. Tim Ferriss: Did you feel any pressure in the sense, not from your parents directly, but in the recognition of what they were sacrificing for you to take a stab at tennis? Or was that just not a factor at all? Maria Sharapova: Whatever they did, they never made me feel like it was. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why I never felt the pressure of having to win things or having to earn money. I knew that I didn\u2019t know how much money I could earn. I was never really interested in that. I didn\u2019t know anything that would come with being a successful tennis player. And you never really do. And I think that\u2019s one of the great things in life is that you don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s an experience, and it\u2019s for you to experience and for you to acknowledge and for you to learn from it. And whether you want to take it or not, that\u2019s up to you. It\u2019s in your own hands. But the fact that they gave me this opportunity to create a life for myself is incredible. And now, my father remained kind of the leader and the coach of my tennis until I was 21 years old. He traveled with me to every single tournament. And after I won my third Grand Slam, it was very mutually, he decided to stop. And now he\u2019s on a permanent vacation. And he thinks he\u2019s training for the senior Olympics. And he loves to ski and hike and do all of those great things. And I\u2019m so happy. And it makes me just incredibly grateful that I can support that and that I can do that for my mom, and that I can do that for my dad, for my extended family. And they\u2019re the reason why I\u2019m able to do that. Tim Ferriss: Is it true that you\u2019ve never used the word rejection or that you don\u2019t believe in that word? Is that true? Maria Sharapova: Well, it\u2019s a very tough word to believe in. It\u2019s a very tough word to accept. I think one of the reasons is because I saw, in many different scenarios, where my father would say no because he would open up an opportunity to say yes. And \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Okay, please explain. Maria Sharapova: So there are many situations, whether it was a coaching opportunity, or whether it was receiving money from an agency, he had this ability to say no to the things that they made sense, like the easy way out, because he believe that later, he\u2019d have a better opportunity to say yes to bigger and greater things. Tim Ferriss: Got it. So he said no to the small, shiny objects in front of him. Maria Sharapova: Well, at the time, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t seem so small. Tim Ferriss: Not small, I don\u2019t mean at the time and perception, but the short term, shiny objects maybe. Maria Sharapova: Right. So rejection, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 there was never \u2013 because I always was following and kind of next to my father and seeing the decisions that he would make. I was only a kid. And even when I won Wimbledon, I was only 17 years old. You\u2019re still a kid. And you\u2019re still following the guidance. And I\u2019d win a match following that, or I\u2019d win a tournament, and I\u2019d go shopping in a store, and I\u2019d call my mom because there was something quite pricey, and I didn\u2019t know if I could buy it. And so I was still asking permission, even though I had earned that money, if I could purchase a piece of jewelry or shoes or whatever it was, at the time that I won. And so I was always watching and observing. And they never \u2013 rejection, of course, when someone says no to you, it\u2019s easy to say, yes, I was rejected. But if you can open up a different opportunity from that point of view, then, you\u2019re turning a no into something that brought you to a better place. Tim Ferriss: It sounds like you did that with your interactions with some of the other players who were boarding at Nick\u2019s Tennis Academy in a way. Maria Sharapova: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Do you consider yourself an introvert, an extrovert, a blend? How do you think about that? Maria Sharapova: I think, from a very young age, sort of the process that I went through and the success that I earned from a young age and winning a major and a Grand Slam at such a young age, and because it became so unexpected, I went from being someone that people scouted to being someone that everyone had analyzed and knew about and wanted to know more of. And I created this \u2013 I definitely put on these horse blinders because, if I had not, my mind would have been everywhere. And I think it would have been so easy to be distracted in those moments and situations and be pulled in different directions, which it\u2019s a slippery slope. It\u2019s very dangerous. And, as a young girl, it could have been a disaster, to say the least. And so I definitely remember the moment, and it was just a few matches before I won Wimbledon, when I was sitting down with my coach. And I think it was before the semifinals of that tournament. And all of these tourists who had gotten credentials \u2013 they seemed like tourists, I didn\u2019t know who they were. Maybe they weren\u2019t. Maybe they were important agents or sponsors. But, at the time, they just seemed like tourists that wanted a picture with me. And it really came overnight. And that sense of, Wow, everyone all of a sudden wants something. Everyone wants something that you have. Everyone wants to be a part of your success. I didn\u2019t like that feeling. I loved the feeling of being in a position of showcasing what I could do with my tennis racket. But that feeling of everyone wanting a piece of that, and the feeling of your opponents all of a sudden feeling like, just by beating her, they\u2019re not just winning a quarter final or a final of a match, but they\u2019re winning so much more. It made me feel like I needed to kind of put myself in a bubble, to concentrate, to focus. That it was going to be that much harder, that much more difficult. And I did. And I don\u2019t know if I could have done it another way. Tim Ferriss: What were some of the \u2013 or what are some of the best practices or decisions that have helped you with that? For instance, my friend Josh that I was mentioning earlier who became well known, effectively overnight, particularly with the movie about his life, for chess. He could no longer compete effectively after that because he would go to a chess tournament, and there would be \u2013 I\u2019m making up the age \u2013 but he\u2019s something like 13 or 14. And all of a sudden, there are 20 girls who want his attention and a bunch of reporters. And he removed himself completely from the competitive scene. He\u2019s one of the most private people I know, at this point. So what helped you? What kind of decisions or advice or practices? Maria Sharapova: I think it was surrounding myself with good minds and good people that had my best interest. And it\u2019s so easy to say those words, but I know how difficult it is to find those people and even harder nowadays than it was. And I saw it in so many different examples of other tennis players and of their success and their paths after that and the people that you, all of a sudden, associate yourself with. I think, as an individual, it\u2019s very easy to be affected by the voices that are next to you because we listen to that. And we process that information. And, all of a sudden, I won\u2019t say we want to be like them, but we interpret it in our way. But when I read a funny book, all of a sudden, I feel like I\u2019m a comedian. Or when I watch an incredible acting by someone, it inspires me to be an actor. It\u2019s like there\u2019s moments of this that happens, as an athlete, you surround yourself with peoples\u2019 opinions or choices or money and wealth. And it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s such an easy distraction. And I surrounded myself with good people. And the friends that I have today were my friends when I was a young girl, that my manager has managed me since I was 11 years old. And now, my mom is still very much my best friend and another really good friend of mine I met with I was 11 years old as well. So I have this fondness of developing those real connections with people. And I think it was so helpful for me, as a young girl, because I competed in front of thousands of people, and I still do. And the walk to the tunnel and the walk to a press conference, and the walk back in the hotel room, it\u2019s a very lonely journey. And it\u2019s a difficult \u2013 you\u2019re in your mind a lot, and you\u2019re thinking a lot. So when you have voices next to you that are the right voices, then, it\u2019s so helpful. But I know how hard it is to find. But I do believe that that is a big part of my success. Tim Ferriss: I have some public exposure and have found I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes and found it really difficult to identify, in some cases, what ulterior motives are or if people start doing me tons of favors, I now realize there might be something coming six months later. So I\u2019m very hesitant to accept favors. But I can\u2019t even imagine the level. I\u2019m playing T-ball, and you\u2019re in the major leagues in the World Series when it comes to how many people want a piece of you. And how do you, for instance, assess someone if you have coffee or lunch with them? What do you look out for or look for? How do you decide whether it\u2019s someone you want to see a second time or talk to a second time? If anything comes to mind, and this is just because, quite frankly, you\u2019ve had a lot more practice \u2013 Maria Sharapova: Because you\u2019ve had a lot of requests. Tim Ferriss: Well, you\u2019ve had a lot more practice than I have. Maria Sharapova: I saw that email back you sent. I was like wow. About automatic reply. I was like, oh, my goodness. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Maria Sharapova: I don\u2019t know who is emailing you. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m afraid I have 4,091 unread email in my inbox currently. It was released into the wild. Maria Sharapova: I can\u2019t do that. I need to keep my inbox clean. Then I feel like I have a mess in my head. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ll talk about that next. But, in the meantime \u2013 Maria Sharapova: So how do I choose? I think it\u2019s about \u2013 I love meeting people, and I love having conversation, and I love being inspired. And you can get so much out of a conversation by exposing yourself to being in an unfamiliar territory. And I\u2019ll give you an example that I felt like it was important because I\u2019m always around the same people. So I have my team, which is my coach and my fitness coach and my trainer. And we travel. I see them more than my family. We travel probably 260 days out of the year together, breakfast, lunch, dinners, practice, training. We know so much of each other, and then, you have a manager. And then, you come home, and you have your friends. So I\u2019m always surrounded by people that I know and that I trust and that I love, which is incredible. But I always think that, as a human being and from a perspective of the mind and growth and intellectually, when you\u2019re put in a situation where you\u2019re unfamiliar with people, and you\u2019re unfamiliar with their stories or who they are, and you have to ask questions to get that out, it makes you a much more interesting person. And so last year, I put myself in this position where I had all of this time off. And it was during the summer. And I signed up for these two business courses in Boston at Harvard Business School. And I was one out of the 40 students, I believe, in each of these courses. And I stayed on campus. And these were individuals who were CEOs and COOs of companies, of airlines, of Microsoft, of all of these incredible brands. And I was, by far, the youngest and probably the silliest and the least knowledgeable one in the room. But just by being with them, just by sitting with them, just by sitting with them at dinner, by asking them questions, by feeling a little bit uncomfortable, I felt like, at the end of those three weeks, I grew and I grew. And it wasn\u2019t that \u2013 there were definitely things that I learned that I\u2019m applying and that I wanted to apply in my business. But the biggest thing that I got out of it was that I grew as a person. I became familiar in a very unfamiliar territory. I still keep in touch with people in the classes. We have completely different lives. They\u2019re CEOs of companies. They have three or four kids. They travel all over the place. And here I am, a 30-year-old athlete. But there\u2019s so much respect in that room because we\u2019re all trying to learn and to grow. And so when you asked me, \u201cWho are the people that you want to meet with or speak to or have a coffee with?\u201d, I always think of that. And the people that I choose to be with are the people that I want to learn from and that I want to have a conversation with and not just about what they bought at the flea market or how they like their coffee. But it\u2019s about the world, and it\u2019s about education, and it\u2019s about people. And it\u2019s not about right or wrong. I don\u2019t always have conversation because I want to know what makes someone perfect. I like to hear opinions. And I got out of that experience in Boston. And I felt like I grew. I felt like I stepped up, and I got out of my comfort zone, and I followed up with them. And we still keep in touch about business and projects and things like that. So it was a very interesting experience personally for me. Tim Ferriss: What I like about your answer, and what I think is healthy for me to hear, quite frankly, is that I frame the question by focusing on what to cut out. How do you avoid this? How do you find red flags for that? What do you look for, ulterior motive, fill in the blank. And somebody said to me two days ago that that is a very male way of approaching trying to solve problems. To find the cancer and cut it out. To remove it. To put it off. And the way you answered the question was, you didn\u2019t explicitly say this, but, \u201cHere\u2019s how I choose who to spend time with.\u201d Not, \u201cHere\u2019s how I decide who to avoid.\u201d Maria Sharapova: But by no means does that come with guarantees that you\u2019re not going to be disappointed at the end of it, or that they\u2019re going to want something from you that you weren\u2019t expecting. Tim Ferriss: Right. Maria Sharapova: But you do, in order to \u2013 you have to put yourself in a position to find out. And what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen from it? You don\u2019t reply, or you don\u2019t answer, or you don\u2019t get back to them? Okay. Tim Ferriss: Right. It\u2019s an acceptable cost or tax to pay. Now, so the reframing that you just did, this is, for me right now, in my life at least, the really important stuff. And I suspect this is true for a lot of folks. And I\u2019d love to switch gears a little bit and just ask you about self talk. So what you\u2019re saying to yourself \u2013 and I\u2019ll choose something very specific: When you are in a competitive situation, if you look back at your competitive career up to this point, when you\u2019ve been down and then come back to win versus when you\u2019ve been down and then lost, how does your self talk differ? Can you think of any examples? Are there certain things that you repeat to yourself consistently when you come back and win versus maybe things you forget to say or ways that you slip up when you end up losing? Is there any pattern to that or consistency? Maria Sharapova: I can say there is a pattern because every \u2013 what\u2019s great about the sport that I play and the situations that I\u2019m in is that they\u2019re all very unique. And that\u2019s what makes it so exciting to do this after so many years and after being this child prodigy. And when I think about the motivation that I\u2019m able to have until this day, and until that fire is burning, I\u2019ll always keep playing. But that\u2019s the unique part of it is that every day is different. Every match is different. You might be confident. You might be ready. You might be healthy, but you never know what\u2019s going to happen. And I\u2019m someone that loves certainty. I love certainty in my life, and I do enjoy having a plan. But that\u2019s not realistic. And there\u2019s so much uncertainty in what I do. So I know that I can prepare my best. I know that I can prepare my body, I can prepare my mind. But in any situation that I\u2019m in, it\u2019s always different. And you have to react to it differently. And it doesn\u2019t always go according to play. And I don\u2019t always find myself being positive. But something that I noticed in my mind was actually in the last match I played. And it was in a match where I got injured at the end of it and, actually, I was up in the third set in Rome. And I came into the match being a little bit upset. I was down. And just for other reasons. And I knew the framework that I had in my mind was that \u2013 it was something along the words of, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not able to. I don\u2019t feel well. I\u2019m not there. My mind is not present. And the second that I changed that, and I changed it to, I will, and I kept saying to myself, I will win the match, and I will win the match. It was like the instance I remember being down a break point. And, automatically, there was something in my body language where my mind, just the repetition of what I was saying to myself, it just triggered my body. I became more aggressive. I stepped into the court. I took her second serve, and I hit a winner. And, from that point, it changed. In the end of the match, I was up I believe it was 2-0 something. I tore a muscle in my hip, and I had to give her the match. But I noticed this crazy change, which I don\u2019t really notice as much. And it was amazing that it just came. This was the question that you just phrased, but it was the last match that I had played. But it happens a lot. I do a very \u2013 so I do take my time in between in my service games. I walk to the baseline. I move my strings around. I do a little pep talk, and it\u2019s very automatic. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s something crazy or something \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It doesn\u2019t have to be crazy. What is the pep talk? Maria Sharapova: I think it\u2019s more of putting my eyes onto my strings and having this repetition that, it doesn\u2019t matter if I won the point or lost the point. But I\u2019m just on this level, that I\u2019m on this path, that I\u2019m on this river that is going to get to where it\u2019s going no matter what rock is in the way, no matter what storm is on the way. The water is, ultimately, going to go down the river. And maybe pep talk is not the right way. I do think that our mind is always working, always saying things, and you\u2019re not always so conscious of it. But it\u2019s this routine that I have, and I think it\u2019s kind of a safe place for me because, in a match, it can be an hour match, or it can be a three-hour match. And, in tennis, momentum changes so much just like in life. One second everything is positive, and you get bad news. And someone is leaving the company or someone is not going to work anymore or someone is not healthy. And, all of a sudden, you go from a great day to, wow. And it\u2019s just a way for me. I see those strings, and I see my fingers playing with those strings, and I think of being level-headed and being not overly excited. Not down, but being in this medium frame of mind. Tim Ferriss: I would love to dig into, specifically, and this is related to serving. And you\u2019ll start to notice a theme here that this is also very self-interested because I\u2019ve never learned how to play tennis despite the fact that I grew up out on Long Island surrounded by people on tennis courts, most of which I was not allowed on. I would serve their coffee. But I\u2019m going to my first tennis camp in the next few months to try to learn to play tennis. And what recommendations would you have \u2013 Maria Sharapova: Don\u2019t do it. Wear sunscreen. Tim Ferriss: Besides don\u2019t do it because I\u2019ve already jumped off the cliff, and I\u2019m trying to grow wings. For serving because I think you\u2019ve hit up to 121-mile-an-hour serves, which just makes my eyes spin inside of my skull. I can\u2019t even imagine what that looks like. Any tips for the people out there? I\u2019ll de-personalize, not Tim, but actually for Tim. The people out there who would like to be better at serving, do you have any recommendations, dos or do nots? Maria Sharapova: The one thing that I notice a lot with people that are just starting to play tennis, and it\u2019s not just about the serve, but it\u2019s in all strokes, is that they take their eye off the ball in order to see the result or where the ball is going, which is a big mistake in the beginning, especially because the more eye contact you have with the ball, the more the strings of your racket are going to be on the ball itself. So seeing the lines of the ball, visualizing that, will really help you. Kind of maintaining when you lift your arm up to hit a serve. Sometimes we want to bring it right back down as we make contact. So keeping that left arm up is something that I focus on when I make a few errors. Tim Ferriss: As a right-hander. Maria Sharapova: Yeah, as a right-hander, or if it\u2019s a left-hander, then keeping your right arm up. I would say those are the two top things. By the way, I am the worst at coaching. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t believe it for a second. Maria Sharapova: Please do because it\u2019s so true. Someone asked me the other day, \u201cWould you ever consider coaching?\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, my goodness, no.\u201d Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re like, I\u2019ve had enough tennis on one side. Maria Sharapova: I\u2019d probably rather commentate. Tim Ferriss: I think you just don\u2019t like talking about yourself. Maria Sharapova: I don\u2019t. Tim Ferriss: But you are \u2013 I think you probably are a very good coach. If you\u2019re a good player, you can be, I think, if you get the right questions, maybe a good coach. So I\u2019m going to try. So where do you think tennis players don\u2019t \u2013 let\u2019s just say novice, intermediate \u2013 waste a lot of time? Where do they focus too much or spend too much time on? And where should they spend more time? Maria Sharapova: I think they spend a lot of time on the outcome. I think that a lot goes into the result. Is it in? Is it out? Is it long? Is it in the net? And it, all of a sudden, becomes your focus. It becomes your focus point. That\u2019s why I mentioned watching the ball as long as you can because it takes your mind away from thinking if the ball is going to be in or out. And therefore, I always feel that your attitude and your body language, I\u2019ve always that that\u2019s a very big part of the game itself and how you\u2019re able to transfer this body language from a mistake into a winner that you hit in just the next ball or in a few balls. And sometimes, that\u2019s all it takes because tennis is a matter of really millimeters. You could do the same thing, and the ball, the wind takes it and it\u2019s long. And if you\u2019re playing in conditions where it\u2019s not windy, you do the same exact thing, and you have the same technique, but it goes in. And one day, you\u2019re cursing at yourself and you\u2019re upset, and then next day, you think you just won a Grand Slam. So it\u2019s a very thin line. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But I think there\u2019s a lot of attitude that needs to calm down. When I watch junior tournaments, when I watch body language, when I see facial expressions and looking over on the sides of the court. And a lot of it is because tennis is so emotional and it\u2019s so in the moment. And every single point counts. And you want it to count. And, of course, it shows how passionate you are about it. But the attitude is a very important part of being a tennis player. Tim Ferriss: In addition to the attitude, or layered on top of the attitude \u2013 and I half-promise this will be my last question about technique \u2013 in the first month, if you were coaching your son or daughter in tennis, and let\u2019s just assume they said, \u2018The last thing I want to do is tennis.\u2019 And then, at age 20, they\u2019re like, \u2018Actually, I want to do tennis\u2019 \u2013 Maria Sharapova: Well, they can just get an instructor. Tim Ferriss: Just because dealing with a little kid is a whole thing in and of itself. But we could also de-personalize it and just say you were teaching someone you care about, right? Maria Sharapova: Right. Tim Ferriss: What would you make sure they get right in the first four weeks? What would you really focus on? Maria Sharapova: So I think the basic techniques. And even when you\u2019re young, that\u2019s the main thing. Those are your fundamentals. So if you need to go right, and you\u2019re going to Big Sur, but you turn left, from the beginning, you\u2019re done. And that\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen tennis is that the mechanics are important, and they need to be easy. Sometimes I see strokes that are so complicated and that are so \u2013 the back swing is huge, and the spins are crazy, and I think it definitely can be much more simple. And it\u2019s not about power. It\u2019s not about hitting a winner. A lot of it is controlled power. I play very aggressive and powerful game. But when I play the best is when it\u2019s controlled power, when I don\u2019t want it to be power, but when my strokes are simple, when they\u2019re not complicated, when I\u2019m not trying to grunt as loud as I can, even though I grunt very loud. When it\u2019s really compact, keeping your elbow close to your body instead of having this huge loop. And really zoning-in on the ball. I always see people take their eyes off the ball. Tim Ferriss: Well, I hate to say it, but I think your next book might be about tennis technique. Maria Sharapova: I doubt it. Tim Ferriss: So I\u2019m not going to forget to mention it, but I do want to mention it. You have a new book. And I have more questions. I won\u2019t keep you here five hours as much as I want to. But you have a new book, Unstoppable, which I am, actually, extremely, extremely excited to read. And my listeners know, I do not actually always say that. I\u2019m very excited to dig into it. But can you tell us a little bit about it? And then, I will give one of many reasons why I\u2019m excited to check it out. But could you tell us A) Why write a book? Because books are a pain in the ass, and I can speak from experience. Maria Sharapova: Well, I didn\u2019t know that. Now that I\u2019ve just finished reading the audio version, and I know it\u2019s completed, I just took a deep breath, and I said, \u201cWow.\u201d I have so much respect for every book that\u2019s on that shelf in front of me right now. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re like, I can\u2019t believe people do this for a living. Who would ever do that? Maria Sharapova: But, you know what? About 2 1/2 years ago, I had a meeting with an agent. And I sat down, and she came into the meeting talking to me about a potential memoir. And it was so far. It was just an idea that she had. It was not really even a vision or a plan. She just wanted to talk to me about it. She knew a little bit about my story, about moving to America. She didn\u2019t know everything. And we had this conversation, and I came into the meeting actually just taking the meeting because I wanted to be nice. And I never thought that I was ready to write a book and to share so much of what I share in this book about moving to America, about facing my rivals, about my personal life, about all of the experiences that I\u2019ve had in the 30 years that I\u2019ve lived. And I wrote a few paragraphs myself. And it was interesting because I left a meeting feeling like, Wow, I\u2019m really going to write a book, aren\u2019t I? And it wasn\u2019t anything that she said. It was just the conversation and her asking me about my story. And as I started speaking about it, her eyes lit up, and she said it was incredible. And I looked at her like, Huh, really? Because, I don\u2019t know, I think that everyone\u2019s story is special, and everyone gets to where they are in their own certain unique ways. And I just don\u2019t go about my life thinking that I know that it\u2019s very different and that it\u2019s maybe one in a million and that my family took a chance. But I don\u2019t walk around thinking, Wow, this is brilliant. And so I walked out of that meeting thinking, Wow, I might be a writer. I might write a book. And so I wrote a few paragraphs myself. And, in just a few weeks\u2019 time, we got this offer with no questions asked. No, is this going to be gossip? No, who is going to be part of the story? I signed with Sarah Crichton at FSG, and she wanted to hear my story. And I don\u2019t know. It inspired me. It made me feel like there was a lot of inspirational work that I could put on paper for people to read. There was a writer that I had in mind whose name is Rich Cohen, who you\u2019re very familiar with. Tim Ferriss: I am. You made such a great choice. That was one of the things I was going to bring up. Just for people who don\u2019t know, and I hate to interject, but this is another thing that made me so excited. Rich has written just some incredible books. Maria Sharapova: Jerry Weintraub\u2019s book was incredible. Tim Ferriss: And also The Fish That Ate the Whale, which a lot of people have heard of. Two or three friends, one of their favorite books of all time. So I\u2019ll let you carry on. But Rich, you made a great choice. Maria Sharapova: When I read Jerry Weintraub\u2019s book somewhere on holiday during my off season in November probably I\u2019d say seven years ago, I said to myself that if I ever write a book, that Rich Cohen would help me do it. And when I made the decision to write this book, I had my agent find out who Rich Cohen was, where he lived, what he did, if he had time to do this. I didn\u2019t even know if this was a possibility. So I met him, and this is so fascinating because I met with three writers. And I met him at this swanky New York hotel. And he walked in there just looking like he did not belong. And I knew exactly that this was my guy. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s my guy. Maria Sharapova: That\u2019s my guy. I knew that he knew where he was going, he took the train, he had his shoulder bag on. And he was just looking around. He was simple. And our conversation was very simple. It wasn\u2019t anything over the top. But I knew that just meeting with him for 30 minutes, that he was a genius in his literature. And that\u2019s where his genius has come out. It\u2019s on paper. And I got that sense from the beginning. And another reason I chose to work with him was because, throughout my life, I have been influenced by a lot of male figures. My father, my coaches, Nick Bollettieri, Robert Lansdorp, and my manager. And I wanted Rich to sit down with these people. I wanted him to sit down with these people to really get an understanding of the characters that were part of my life that made me who I am today. And I thought of these people. I thought of my father, and I thought of the person that he would give the time to, that he would open up to, that he would share with. And I think that was one of the biggest reasons that I \u2013 he and my father spent over a week together just talking and talking. And it wasn\u2019t even \u2013 life talking, stories. My father was able to tell stories that I read in the book, and I was like, wow, wow. I was so young that I don\u2019t remember it. And, yeah, he was \u2013 we spent so many weeks together. I love the way that he worked. I loved the questions that he would \u2013 I just loved the simplicity of him as a human being. Tim Ferriss: I love the filter also. It wouldn\u2019t have even occurred to me, at least in this conversation, if you hadn\u2019t mentioned it. But the fact that it\u2019s not just who you like and whose writing you like, but who other people will talk to. Maria Sharapova: Because a big part of my story is the other people that influenced my life. And because I started my life at such a young age, I started this crazy move, and this crazy profession, and these people were so influential. And they\u2019re very much a part of this, a part of the reason that I\u2019m here. Tim Ferriss: Unstoppable, My Life So Far. Many, you have a lot of decades left. Maria Sharapova: Well, I wanted it to be called \u2018To Be Continued\u2019. And I got shut down really fast. They were like, that\u2019s basically telling everyone to get a new book. I was like, wait a second, that\u2019s been my dream ever since I \u2013 because when I would see memoirs or autobiographies written by younger individuals, I would think to myself, do they really think that their life is over and that this is all they have to tell? So of course, when you say that, you have a book come out, a memoir when you\u2019re 30 years old. And I had this vision of calling it \u2018To Be Continued\u2019. But they were like, you have to explain what\u2019s inside the pages and not what\u2019s coming out next. And I was like, no. Tim Ferriss: What you could do\u2026so you could have this Unstoppable, My Life So Far, and then you write your coaching book that you promised me you\u2019d write. Then the third book can be Unstoppable, My Life Continues or It Continues. So I think you could get a number of things. Maria Sharapova: I can play with it, I know. Tim Ferriss: You can play with it. Maria Sharapova: We have many different titles. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d love to ask some micro questions just about routine and perhaps a couple of other rapid-fire questions that I\u2019d like to ask. Before I get to that, I know you\u2019ve had some shoulder issues in your life. I\u2019ve had shoulder reconstructive surgery and improved mobility and recovered largely. Maria Sharapova: Good luck with that serve, if you\u2019ve had that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know. Fortunately, it\u2019s on my non-dominant arm. Maria Sharapova: Oh, that\u2019s good. Tim Ferriss: But I was going to ask you. You mentioned some of your team, the fitness coach and so on. What have you found to help most? Or are there any particular exercises that have made you more resilient against injury? So for injury prevention, what are some of the components of, say, your fitness program that you think have helped most? Maria Sharapova: I like that you used the word \u2018prevention\u2019 because a lot of the makeup of an athlete is about prevention. And we do so much to try to prevent injuries. And we don\u2019t always succeed. But a big part of the little exercises and the tedious things and the repetition is that. And I would say the biggest component \u2013 because I went through shoulder surgery \u2013 is the consistency of keeping up with the exercises. There\u2019s a lot of exercise out there. And they\u2019re all great exercises. But it\u2019s very rare that you keep doing them. And I start every morning, after my shoulder surgery, before every practice I have a routine with a rubber band. That\u2019s not a rare routine for a tennis player. We all warm up. We do about a 30-minute warmup before we even get to warm up on the court before a match. So there are a lot of little scapula exercises that you do. Tim Ferriss: And this is with a Thera-Band? Maria Sharapova: A Thera-Band, right, yeah. And a lot of it is not even about the weight that you have or the resistance of the Thera-Band, but it\u2019s the repetition that you do so the feeling that you have in the back of your scapula or in the tendons of your shoulder is that it starts burning. That\u2019s when you really know that the little muscles in between the big ones are firing. And the more consistent you are with that, the bigger chance of you getting healthy and also preventing something else to happen because your body always compensates. So if I have an injury in one place, your body \u2013 the brain is so smart that it starts using other parts of the body. And, all of a sudden, you feel it somewhere else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Maria Sharapova: So the consistency of following through and really keeping at it is, for me, always the most challenging thing. And I see people give up on it. Tim Ferriss: What about for the lower body? Are there any particular exercises that you\u2019d wished you\u2019d incorporated earlier? Maria Sharapova: So I grew very fast. And that\u2019s something that I speak about in the book as well because none of \u2013 no one in my family is tall. I\u2019m the tallest one. And I talk about the struggles that I had as a teenager during that period of time. And my father says I grew because I had this will to grow and that I needed it for my sport and that it was everyone\u2019s wish, including mine, that I would be taller so I could serve from a higher angle or that I could be more powerful. But with that comes you\u2019re a little bit less explosive. You\u2019re not as mobile. You\u2019re a little stiffer. And I think movement, in tennis, you have so many movements that are just back and forth and changing direction. And so I work a lot on the joints. I work a lot on balance. Balance of the core and then balance on little unstabilizing platforms where I really work my ankles and my knees, make sure those are all aligned and not wobbling too much. Just gaining the confidence. And, sometimes, they seem like simple exercises. If you take a picture of them or a video of them, and they\u2019re the ones that you don\u2019t want to post because someone will think you\u2019re not doing anything. You know what I mean? They\u2019re not impressive looking. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you\u2019re not doing an Olympic weightlifting maneuver. Maria Sharapova: No. You\u2019re not doing any RDLs. But the little things that take time and that look so simple and that are boring are the ones that really, not only do you keep your focus, but you keep your strength and the balance. And I work on my core a lot because I do believe it\u2019s the center of your body, and it controls so much of \u2013 it puts the body together. It\u2019s like the glue. Tim Ferriss: If you could only choose one or two core exercises to do, what would they be? Maria Sharapova: Oh, wow. I love using the TRX band, that yellow band and putting it up \u2013 hanging it and putting my feet in it and doing the planks. Tim Ferriss: Yes. Maria Sharapova: And then sort of doing bicycles while you\u2019re in a plank when your feet are in the TRX. I like that. Tim Ferriss: So you\u2019re crossing your midline with your knee. Maria Sharapova: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yes, that\u2019s a fantastic exercise. Maria Sharapova: That\u2019s a little bit on the advanced side, but I know that your audience can do it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And you can also folks, if you have really tough top of your feet, you can do that. I actually have some rings that I\u2019m looking at outside on my patio set up at sort of push-up height. And you can do something very, very similar. Maria Sharapova: Exactly. And I do a lot on the physio ball. And that\u2019s always simple. Most gyms have it. Even just the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Also known as a Swiss ball if people are \u2013 Maria Sharapova: A Swiss ball, yes. There are a lot of terms. Yeah. I like doing all different types of planks or just floor planks and extending your arms or extending your legs one at a time out. So it\u2019s a kind of element of surprise in balance where it\u2019s not just static. Tim Ferriss: Right. And for those of you who have heard my conversations with Dr. Peter Attia, he is a huge fan of doing different plank motions on the physio ball. And just to your point about unimpressive exercises, so I have completely changed my lower-body performance and just stability in the last six months using slant boards, which make you look like you\u2019re on the most unenjoyable drug imaginable. But it\u2019s this tiny, tiny adjustment that I feel like has changed my entire lower body by focusing on the feet. Maria Sharapova: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So here, here. Now, I\u2019m also looking at them right now, I have a bottle of geranium essential oil, I know it\u2019s not a [inaudible] [01:31:48], but bare with me. Maria Sharapova: Okay. Tim Ferriss: I have a geranium because it was recommended to me by somebody named Nicholas McCarthy who is a one-handed concert pianist who uses geranium when he is writing and composing because he found it helped keep him alert without over-stimulating him. So he was relaxed and alert. So at some point, I saw a video of you when you were 14, a star in the making. Maria Sharapova: Essential oils? Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s right. Candles and aromatherapy. Maria Sharapova: Candles and essential oils. Oh, I still love that stuff. Tim Ferriss: Are you still into that? Maria Sharapova: I am. You should see the room that I\u2019m in right now. I have all of these oils and all of these candles. Yeah. Well, for me, it\u2019s about this feeling of being in your home environment and comfort. And that\u2019s something that you don\u2019t get when you travel so much. So when I do, it\u2019s kind of my way of feeling \u2013 every morning, I turn on my incense and my candles, and I have my coffee. It\u2019s like the smell of being home. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the go-to morning incense? Maria Sharapova: It\u2019s a Moroccan scent. I don\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s in it, but it smells like I\u2019m in Morocco, even though I\u2019ve never been there. Another one that\u2019s on my list. Tim Ferriss: Do you not bring those smells with you when you travel? Maria Sharapova: I don\u2019t. Interestingly enough, when I go on a trip, I know that that\u2019s my work. I like leaving those things behind because it makes me feel that I\u2019m going there for a reason, and I\u2019m not going there to be comfortable. I\u2019m not going to be there in my environment. I\u2019m there to do my job. And I will come back home, and I\u2019ll have everything. I\u2019ll have my friends, and I\u2019ll be around my family. But when I leave, it\u2019s like there are so many times when I\u2019ve left, and I\u2019ve gone on a plane, and it\u2019s the middle of the day in Manhattan Beach, and the sun is shining, and everyone is playing volleyball. And I look at that, and I\u2019m like, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s definitely hard. My friends are out there, and I want to be out there. And I want to be enjoying the sunset. But I know what I\u2019m going out there for. I know that, come a time when I have five days off, I\u2019ll be able to take my friends on vacation and treat them to a beautiful time. But now is my time to work. And so I like leaving those things behind because it makes me feel that there is a prize at the end of it. There is something that makes my job different. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. Tim Ferriss: It makes perfect, 100 percent sense to me. And it actually relates to something that made me smile when I read it. I was looking at a transcript of a conversation that you had. And this requires a little bit of context, but I\u2019ll shorten it. I hate the word \u2018balance\u2019. What is balance? Because it\u2019s 50/50 that means you\u2019re only giving 50 percent to both things. So I\u2019ve always disliked the phrase \u2018work/life balance\u2019 because it implies blending to me. And I like to keep them very, very separate. Maria Sharapova: Right. Tim Ferriss: Do you think that\u2019s something that has helped you more than hurt you or challenged you in terms of relationships, outcomes, and everything else? Do you think there will be a point where you trade that or change your mind about that? Maria Sharapova: I definitely think that it\u2019s challenged me. It\u2019s challenged the way that I think. But I read The One Thing a few years ago by Gary Keller. And it kind of hit home for me when you say that when you wake up in the morning, you put your focus on this one thing of what you want to accomplish during the day, which seems like a no-brainer. It seems like that\u2019s the way that everyone should do it. But it\u2019s so much more complicated than that. For example, when I leave for a trip, and one of my good friends is getting married in August, and I\u2019m going to be either in Cincinnati or Toronto competing at a tournament, I know that I\u2019m not there for my friend. It\u2019s a big day. It\u2019s a big event. And yet, I have this career in front of me that is taking priority. And I could give many examples of my personal life as well. But those are choices. Those are your choices. And those are, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think that there is a 50/50 balance. That hasn\u2019t worked for me. I\u2019ve always felt that I\u2019ve had to let something go or sacrifice something. If I\u2019m just 50/50, I\u2019m never 100 percent. And I want to be 100 percent. When you train hours on end, when you give so much of your body and your mind to this one profession, and whether it\u2019s me playing tennis, whether it\u2019s something else, I don\u2019t want to come into one of the biggest moments and biggest stages of my career and feel that I didn\u2019t do everything that I could. Tim Ferriss: Right. Maria Sharapova: And I do think that some people are okay with that feeling, but I am not. And that\u2019s my choice. And it all comes down to choice. I think we all have them. But as long as I\u2019m able to say, and I do believe that it\u2019s for other people as well, as long as we commit to that choice and not regret that choice or don\u2019t allow ourselves to regret that choice, then that\u2019s when it\u2019s the right formula for us. Tim Ferriss: Now, you have many, many, many choices that are put in front of you. And you have people to help. But I would love to talk about choices in the morning. So first thing in the morning has come up a number of times. And I\u2019m rather obsessed with morning routines. So you mentioned the incense, Morocco. You mentioned the tea, Darjeeling. When you wake up, do you eat breakfast right away? What does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like? And what\u2019s the script? What is the algorithm for you? Maria Sharapova: It\u2019s different all of the time. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Is breakfast consistent? For instance, for this week, what is your go-to breakfast? Maria Sharapova: So I\u2019m in training right now, and I\u2019m getting ready to play all of these hardcore tournaments. And so for the last weeks, I\u2019ve been healing an injury. Now that that\u2019s all good, I\u2019m back into the routine of just intense training every day. And so I start at a particular time in the morning. I like to wake up early. I like to go to bed early, so I wake up early. I like to get about eight to nine hours of sleep. Sleep has been a big part of, I just feel like the makeup of how I feel, of the energy level that I have. Yeah. I wake up at 6:30. I usually have to be ready by 9 for practice. So I use that time, and it kind of depends. Right now, I have a couple of businesses that I\u2019m a part of. So a lot of the first hour, hour and a half, I spend maybe on a conference call because that\u2019s usually afternoon time in Europe. So I\u2019ll do one of those. I\u2019ll answer a few emails that\u2019s coming in from Europe. I have a candy brand, so we have to make a lot of decisions on that on a daily basis. Tim Ferriss: Sugarpova. Maria Sharapova: Sugarpova, right. Tim Ferriss: Is it true, and I\u2019m not going to interrupt beyond this, but is it true that you were considering legally changing your last name? Maria Sharapova: It was an idea. Tim Ferriss: For the 2013 US Open. Maria Sharapova: It was an idea. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a genius idea, genius idea. Maria Sharapova: It proved to be very difficult. Tim Ferriss: So you\u2019re taking conference calls. Maria Sharapova: Yeah. So I do that work for the first hour or hour and a half with a cup of coffee that I have to have in the morning with lactose-free milk. Tim Ferriss: What type of lactose-free milk? Sorry, I\u2019m a nerd. Maria Sharapova: Just straight-on lactose-free milk. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I see. So it\u2019s not almond milk or coconut milk? Maria Sharapova: No. Tim Ferriss: I see, lactose-free real milk. And preferred coffee? Maria Sharapova: I do an espresso, simple. And I think, for me, it\u2019s all about the foam. So I have to have the right foam. So I do that. And then, usually, when I\u2019m getting ready, I turn on a podcast, and I listen. It kind of depends on the mood I\u2019m in whether it\u2019s about health or I want to hear about someone\u2019s life or someone\u2019s experiences. I\u2019ll turn that on so by the time I get my stuff ready for the whole day of practices and kind of brushing my teeth, I listen to other people share. Tim Ferriss: What are some of your favorite podcasts? Maria Sharapova: Well, a good friend of mine is Lewis Howes, so I listen to his. I listen to yours a bunch in the past six or eight months, I would say. Dan Harris\u2019s. I listen to a fashion one. A little bit of everything. Tim Ferriss: So Dan Harris, this is Dan Harris of 10% Happier? Maria Sharapova: Yes. Tim Ferriss: All right. Why do you listen to Dan Harris? Because I was going to ask if you have a meditation practice of any type. Maria Sharapova: It\u2019s interesting. Someone asked me the other day, \u201cDo you meditate?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t, but I really feel like I do because I listen to so many people speak about meditating that I really feel like I do.\u201d I had to think for a second. I almost said yes. And I was like, \u201cNo, actually, I don\u2019t meditate, but I listen to people speak about it.\u201d And I have a little bit. I\u2019ve done it, and I enjoy it. Some of it feels a little cultish to me. Tim Ferriss: Sure, there\u2019s plenty of that floating around. Oh, yeah. You didn\u2019t like the cat\u2019s paw and black roses I sent you. Is that what you\u2019re trying to tell me? Maria Sharapova: I like to hear about peoples\u2019 life-changing experience. And I think that\u2019s what really interests me is how something can affect a person, whether it\u2019s reading a book, whether it\u2019s hearing a mantra, whether it\u2019s meditating. So that\u2019s why I like listening to people speak about their practices or how it\u2019s influenced their life or what they were going through that required that. Yeah, I love learning from peoples\u2019 experiences. So I think that\u2019s one of the reasons I listen to his. Tim Ferriss: I think you\u2019ve been meditating your entire life because of your comfort level with repetition. Maria Sharapova: Right. Tim Ferriss: I think that is one in the same, in a lot of respects. Maria Sharapova: The one thing that I\u2019ve, and I don\u2019t really know where I got it from, but one thing that I do, I realize that our thoughts are so spread out and that they go in so many different directions. And when I notice that my mind goes to places that are so unnecessary, when I create my own stories that are so far from the truth, I bring it back to the center of my breath. So I do think about just breathing. And that\u2019s not like me sitting in a chair and having thoughts or saying, \u201cNow I\u2019m going to meditate for 10 minutes.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s just me, whether it\u2019s on a practice court, and things are not going well, or I\u2019m making so many errors. And, all of a sudden, I just create the story that is so far from the truth or the reality. Tim Ferriss: What would be an example of that? Maria Sharapova: So say my coach has me \u2013 say I\u2019ve studied some video analysis, and he showed me a particular stroke that he wants me to work on or a particular movement. And he says that\u2019s incorrect. And he shows me an example of what he thinks I should do a little differently. And so I go on the practice court. I start doing that. And with repetition, I\u2019m not getting the outcome that I wanted. And so I plant the story that no, he\u2019s incorrect. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. Or that no, actually, this doesn\u2019t feel right. This doesn\u2019t feel natural. If it doesn\u2019t feel natural now, it\u2019s not going to feel natural in a competitive state of mind. And all of those things are completely not true. Those are all things that I\u2019m putting in my brain. Tim Ferriss: How do you catch that? What do you say in your own head when you catch it? Maria Sharapova: I\u2019m so aware of my surroundings. And I\u2019m really aware of kind of the inside choices that I make. I\u2019ve had sort of this feeling from a young age where I know how my mind can affect others or my surrounding and myself included, without having to say one word. So I try to bring it back to my breath or, sometimes, changing those words completely, even though those are also not true.\u00a0But they\u2019re much better than the negative outcome that you\u2019re putting out into the world. Tim Ferriss: I interrupted, at some point, which I\u2019m prone to doing because I get all excited. I also want to recommend Hardcore History with Dan Carlin, if you haven\u2019t heard it. Maria Sharapova: Okay, I will tomorrow morning. Tim Ferriss: I recommend starting with Wrath of the Khans is what I would recommend starting with. It is my favorite podcast of all time. And he does one episode every six to 12 months. But you will see why. They are incredible. And also, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say thank you to Lewis, a mutual friend, who made the introduction. Maria Sharapova: That\u2019s right. He made this possible. Tim Ferriss: A very good man. Maria Sharapova: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I think we didn\u2019t get around to it because I got all hoppity and jumped in, but right now, you have the espresso with very important foam. You have some conference calls. You take care of Sugarpova and soon. Maria Sharapova: Then my phone goes in my bag for the next few hours, and I train. Tim Ferriss: When do you eat? What do you have for breakfast? Maria Sharapova: I eat probably 30 minutes before I get to practice. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So for the first 2 1/2 or 3 hours, you\u2019re not having breakfast? Maria Sharapova: I have a liter of water and a cup of coffee. Tim Ferriss: Is it special water? Maria Sharapova: No. It\u2019s Avian water. Tim Ferriss: Got it. It\u2019s not $27 Southern California water. Maria Sharapova: No, no. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Maria Sharapova: And so I drink that. I drink my coffee. And then, breakfast, I usually make myself a smoothie or a green juice with spinach and kale and chia seeds and coconut water and all of the greens, cucumber, kiwi. And I always have a piece of rye bread. That\u2019s kind of the European \u2013 I love rye bread, so I start with that. And I either put some goat cheese on it or a piece of protein or avocado and some berries. And that\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss: Sounds delicious. Maria Sharapova: Thanks. Pretty straightforward. Tim Ferriss: I love rye bread, but my tendency is to eat a whole loaf of rye bread if I allow myself a little bit. I\u2019m not very good at that moderation thing. Maria Sharapova: Well, the thing about rye bread is that I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s so good. I think it\u2019s better than some other breads, but it\u2019s not like sourdough I love, but I don\u2019t eat regular bread that much. So if I was eating a piece of sourdough, I\u2019d probably have three pieces. But rye bread is kind of in between. It\u2019s edible. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s digestible and good, but it\u2019s not a Snicker\u2019s bar. Maria Sharapova: Exactly. But you don\u2019t want too much of it. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good point. Yeah. No. This is a smart approach. So just a few more things. In the last few years, or just in recent memory, what is a new belief or behavior or habit that has greatly improved your life? Does anything come to mind? Maria Sharapova: One thing that I had to go to in the past 15 months was being away from my sport because of a suspension that I faced. And I went through this time period, obviously, with a lot of questions and questions of whether I would return to the sport that I played. But during that same time, I also realized, and I had a chance to stop and really recognize how and what I\u2019ve really done in my life and in my career to inspire others and to \u2013 and I\u2019ve used the word inspire a lot because that\u2019s how I kind of see other people inspire my life. But I had so many moments and instances where I would come across people that would start a conversation with me and tell me how I\u2019ve influenced their kids or how they\u2019ve seen me compete and that they admire my spirit so much and that they can\u2019t wait to see me back. And I never had that realization before, which sounds crazy. And but I never really understood, or I don\u2019t think I really understood, maybe it was selfishly, how much I impacted other people. Tim Ferriss: Did you notice that because PR madness was stressful, and you saw that as a counterbalance? Or why do you think you noticed it? Maria Sharapova: I think I noticed it because so many more people had the courage to speak to me, which usually people would come up to you and ask for an autograph or ask for a picture. And it would just be a few seconds of your time. But these were instances where people would come and have a proper conversation with you about how they can\u2019t wait to see me back, and they can\u2019t wait to see me play and what I mean to them. And it was just different. It was a different communication. It was a different way of \u2013 and every person helped me feel better, there\u2019s no doubt. And there were chefs coming from the kitchen, and there were pilots coming from the cockpit. And it was just an experience I don\u2019t think I would have ever felt. And maybe because I never wanted to feel that huge responsibility that I did have this impact and that I always wanted to keep impacting and always be the right example. Maybe that\u2019s why I never quite \u2013 but I do think that, subconsciously, I didn\u2019t want to give in to that because maybe that would have added more pressure. Because, as I said before, my parents never made me feel that if I did or didn\u2019t make it, that it would be all right to go back to where we started. It was a very eye-opening moment. Tim Ferriss: You had your first sponsor, as I understand it, when you were 11. Maria Sharapova: Yeah, Nike. Tim Ferriss: So when you were getting that amount of attention, and when you have adulation from fans and chefs and so on, it would seem to me a very human temptation and very easy to get a very big head and for that to affect your life and performance and so on. How do you counteract that? Or how do you avoid that? Because that\u2019s been the downfall of many, many people who have been in the limelight for various things. Maria Sharapova: I will say that I\u2019m a fairly realistic person. And I know I\u2019ve been through a lot. And so I faced a lot of grief, I faced a lot of press, I faced a lot of success, I faced a lot of boardroom meetings. I\u2019ve seen a lot. I\u2019ve seen a lot in my years. And, at the end of it is, it\u2019s all \u2013 a lot of it is superficial, and a lot of it almost seems not human, super human. But behind everything, there\u2019s a very human person. There\u2019s a very normal, there\u2019s a very much simple human being that I\u2019ve been fortunate to make good money for my career. But those things are never things that make me the happiest, and I know that, and I realize that. The values that you have in your life are much smaller than that, and they bring so many more rewards than money could ever bring you. Of course, it\u2019s helpful. And knowing that \u2013 it puts a huge smile on my face that I can support my grandparents and that I can buy them a home and that I know they\u2019re going to be comfortable. And they can have their garden and grow their cucumbers, and my cousins can have a proper education. And that feeling is incredible. But that\u2019s \u2013 and that\u2019s a feeling that, of course, money brings you. But, like I said, the relationship that I\u2019ve had with my parents, they\u2019re also very strong people. And they will tell me if something \u2013 if they see that something is going on or if my decisions are not correct. And they\u2019re very real. And I surround myself with real people. I\u2019m a very honest person myself. I think that\u2019s part of the Russian character. I say it like it is. I\u2019m very straight-on about what I feel. And that\u2019s, sometimes, gotten me into trouble just based on maybe I should keep a few opinions to myself. But I like this idea of, tell me how you feel about things. Tell me straight up. Don\u2019t go around \u2013 maybe, this word maybe is brutal. It\u2019s like neither here nor there. So it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s definitely hard because, from a young age, I could have made so many different decisions that could have gotten me to different places. Tim Ferriss: What is one of the worst decisions that you avoided making, or one of the best decisions that your parents helped you make? Maria Sharapova: At that age, it was a lot of decisions that my parents made. But I think, from a business point of view, I\u2019ve been able to be associated with many great brands. And there was a lot of opportunity, especially when I was young, to make what I like to call \u2018quick money\u2019. It\u2019s like wire in the bank, you show up for a shoot, and you do it, and you smile, and you leave. And there you are. And that is not that it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s great that you have this company and this brand that has tracked you down and has seen you and has studied you and wants you to be a part of their brand. But I\u2019ve always felt like the best decisions I\u2019ve made are based on real partnerships, real understanding of what a company, of what myself wants from each other and why we want to work together. And I really believe that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve had these partnerships for such a long time. One example was with Nike. It\u2019s so much more than just me wearing a swoosh on the court. I go into a store, and I take pride in the fact that \u2013 actually, I was walking around the other day, and someone came up to me and said, \u201cWow, you look like you could be a Nike billboard.\u201d And I didn\u2019t know if that was funny or not or if they were making fun at what I was wearing, and I looked at her, and I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d And then, she said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re Maria Sharapova, of course you are. They pay you to wear that.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, actually, you have no idea how happy I am to wear this.\u201d You kind of grow a fondness of the people that you work with. There\u2019s so much that goes into a campaign, a product. And I love that stuff. I love knowing \u2013 I went to the Nike campuses after my Harvard experience. And I followed around \u2013 I went into meetings, and I was a little ghost in all of these meetings because I wanted to learn about product development. Tim Ferriss: That was at Beaverton? Maria Sharapova: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Nice. Maria Sharapova: So I went into these meetings, and I just I wanted to know why a product is dropped and why this material was used and why that material was being developed. And there\u2019s just so much incredible technology. I love fashion. I love creativity. So I got to learn a lot about that. But you take great pride in the people that you work with and the decisions that I made that started with either friendship or partnership where you understand the company, and you know the people are the ones that have grown. Tim Ferriss: I mean, you\u2019re playing the long game, in a lot of ways. And I think there are many people who feel like they know a lot about you. So my last two questions are about things that people might not know about you. And hopefully, there\u2019s a lot of that in this conversation already. But the first one is, if you had to give a TED talk about something you are not known for, no tennis, for instance, what would you talk about? What is the personal obsession that few people know about or something you\u2019re good at that few people know about that you would talk about or anything? Maria Sharapova: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m good at. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d necessarily do a TED talk on it. But I have a huge passion for architecture. And I think I\u2019ve always said that, if I wasn\u2019t a tennis player, I would love to be an architect. I find it\u2019s like my happy place. When I am able to drive around Palm Springs or drive around Tuscany and see the differences in beams and windows, I love studying that. And I spent a few years building a home myself. And that process, if I had the time, which I don\u2019t have at the moment, I would just do for fun. So yeah, that would be something that I\u2019m passionate about that not many people know. Tim Ferriss: What do you like about it? And do you have any favorite types of architecture or architects, any books that have influenced you? Maria Sharapova: Yeah. Absolutely, from Neutra to Frank Gehry. I love the indoor and outdoor feel, and I love when architects are able to bring nature into a home and make it feel like you\u2019re living outside, but you\u2019re kind of in this cocoon environment. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. Tim Ferriss: It makes perfect sense. Maria Sharapova: But I\u2019ve just always been fascinated by how someone can have an idea and draw some lines. And two years later, you have structure, and you have placement, and you have a floor plan, and you have this maze. And it actually started from a young age because, growing up in Florida, I was invited for a few sleepovers. And I would go to a sleepover at, at that time, it was like a rich person\u2019s home that had four or five bedrooms. And I had never seen a home that had four or five bedrooms before. And it\u2019s like, what are all of these rooms for? Why are there two dining rooms? Why isn\u2019t one enough? And that\u2019s when I became fascinated with floor plans and how something connects to another thing and the usage of space and then details like colors and materials. Yeah. It was just always really appealing. Tim Ferriss: What is your personal favorite color? Maria Sharapova: I love neutral colors, so I love grays and darks, no browns. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Maria Sharapova: I don\u2019t want to say black because that\u2019s \u2013 a little girl asked me the other day, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d because she wanted to draw something for me, and I was about to say black, and then, I was like, oh no, she\u2019s not going to like me if I say black. So now, anytime someone asks me my favorite color, I\u2019m like, yellow. It sounds so much happier than black. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I guess it\u2019s hard to say to a little girl who wants to draw you something, black like the Grim Reaper\u2019s cape. Maria Sharapova: Exactly. So I ended up with yellow. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s your cover story? So very last one, and we\u2019ll see what we get is what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? And I\u2019ll give you an example. An example of this. And I asked Cheryl Strayed this question who wrote Wild, which was made into a movie. An amazing woman. And she said, \u201cEvery sandwich I get has to be in uniform layers so every bite is as similar to the next as possible.\u201d So if she gets a sandwich, and all of the avocados are kind of over on one side or whatever, she\u2019ll reopen it and rearrange it so that every bite is the same. So I\u2019m not saying that you have to have something like that. But does anything come to mind, an unusual habit, a weird object, an absurd thing, anything that you love that is a little odd? Maria Sharapova: There are a few random things. I always put my left shoe on before my right. And not just a tennis shoe but any shoe. When I\u2019m in a shoe, and I\u2019m trying shoes, and they hand me a right shoe, and I\u2019m like, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m fine with opening the box again myself. But I\u2019d rather get the left shoe. They give you a strange look. Then, for my match court outfits, I don\u2019t like to wear \u2013 usually, people like to wear the same outfit, so if they did well in it, they\u2019d wear it again. I mean, they wash it but then wear it again. Or maybe they don\u2019t wash it. I don\u2019t know. So I do the opposite. I don\u2019t wear it again. I alternate. Tim Ferriss: So now, does that mean \u2013 Maria Sharapova: I don\u2019t want to wear the same exact one. I\u2019ll wear the same looking outfit, but I have a few different ones. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Okay. But never the exact same outfit again? Maria Sharapova: No. Tim Ferriss: I love it. Maria Sharapova: Not in that same tournament. Tim Ferriss: When you win a huge \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m making a liar of myself, but when you win a big tournament, do you have a favorite cheat food or anything that you celebrate with? Maria Sharapova: I love sweets. I love dulce de leche. Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God. Maria Sharapova: I love we have this cake in Russia, it\u2019s called the medovik. It\u2019s a honey cake. I could eat that every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Tim Ferriss: Is it like baklava, or is it different? Maria Sharapova: No. It\u2019s not as crunchy. It\u2019s a soft cake. It\u2019s a layer cake, but it\u2019s a soft cake. I love cherry \u2013 when my grandmother makes cherry jam, I could eat that by the spoons. That\u2019s a good childhood memory. Yeah. So I love sweets. Tim Ferriss: Well, it makes sense for Sugarpova. Maria Sharapova: For an athlete, right? It makes a lot of sense. Tim Ferriss: Well, it\u2019s great for glycogen replenishment. So for those people wondering, dulce de leche, also known as the crack cocaine of Argentina, delicious on vanilla ice cream. And if it\u2019s going to keep other people up until 4 in the morning because it will drive them nuts, RDLs, Romanian deadlifts, right? Maria Sharapova: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Just so that it doesn\u2019t bother anybody. Maria, this has been so much fun. Maria Sharapova: Thank you. Tim Ferriss: I really appreciate you taking the time. Maria Sharapova: Oh no, thank you so much. Tim Ferriss: And I really encourage people to learn more about your story. I cannot wait to read Unstoppable. And people can find you at mariasharapova.com, Facebook.com/sharapova, and then, Twitter and Instagram are both @mariasharapova. Do you have any final ask of the people listening or a suggestion for the audience, anything that comes to mind? Maria Sharapova: No. I just hope that they continue listening to your work because, when I started, I was so impressed by your interviews and the way you\u2019re able to get a lot out of people in a conversational form. And so keep listening. And I\u2019m so really excited about the opportunity that I have to share my story with other people and to share my journey. Sometimes, we think that our story is not special. And everyone\u2019s story is very special. And I\u2019ve just been so excited about being able to put it on paper and for everyone to read it. So it\u2019s a big \u2013 I\u2019ve always been a very personal and private individual. So it\u2019s sort of a big moment for me because I share a lot of frame of mind that I had as a young girl, as an athlete, as a person, as a daughter and relationships. So there\u2019s a lot I share that I never thought, a few years ago, I would be able to. It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s a little scary. It puts you in a vulnerable place. But I\u2019m very looking forward to hearing what people think of it as well. Tim Ferriss: And A) congratulations, B) we talked about toughness as one of your defining competitive advantages. The fact that you recorded your own audio book. Maria Sharapova: Oh, my God. I was like no one is giving me enough credit for this. Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God. You think walking through or running a marathon in the desert with no water is hard. Recording an entire audio book \u2013 Maria Sharapova: I had to take a couple of days off after that because I was training in the mornings. And then, I\u2019d go, and I\u2019d record six to eight hours for three days. Tim Ferriss: Good God. Maria Sharapova: And I called my team at the end of the third, and I said, \u201cFirst of all, I have no voice. And second of all, you have off tomorrow because I\u2019m not coming.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It is one of the most comprehensively exhausting experiences you can imagine, which is why I\u2019ve never recorded one of my own audio books. I\u2019ve done bits and pieces, and then, I\u2019ve tapped out. Maria Sharapova: Well, what I liked, at the end of it, was that, after I read it, and when you read it out loud, I didn\u2019t want to change a single thing. And that was when I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That is incredibly rare. Maria Sharapova: That was a big milestone. Tim Ferriss: Incredibly rare, which means that the book has to be really, really good. That is a really clear \u2013 no, no, I\u2019m telling you. That\u2019s a really, really clear indicator. If you didn\u2019t change, A) that means that it\u2019s good, B) it means that our dear friend Mr. \u2013 well, I\u2019m kidding, I don\u2019t know him, but Rich Cohen, I know of his work, really got the voice right, which is really, really hard to do. Maria Sharapova: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: So I\u2019m excited to check it out. Everybody check it out, Unstoppable. You can find it everywhere. And thank you so much for the time, Maria. I know that your time is precious. And I know you have a lot of demands on your time, so I really appreciate it. Maria Sharapova: Of course. Thank you. I appreciate it. Tim Ferriss: And to everybody listening, you can find the show notes, as usual, links to everything we talked about. Links to the architects she named. Links to Unstoppable itself, links to everything in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast. And, as always, thank you for allowing me to make this my job, I guess.

where it is my job to distill, extract, deconstruct the habits, routines, and tactics of world-class performers of all different types, whether they are billionaires, chess prodigies, elite athletes, or otherwise", "and in this case, we have elite athlete maria sharapova", "and man, oh, man did i have a lot of fun with this conversation", "we got deep into the tactics of training and mental performance, mental toughness, and much, much more", "you can find her on facebook, sharapova", "you can find her on twitter and instagram, @mariasharapova", "who is maria sharapova", "she is the winner of five grand slam titles and is an olympic silver medalist", "she is only one of a handful of players to hold all four grand slam titles, including wimbledon, us open, australian open, and roland-garros", "she has held the world no", "1 ranking for 21 weeks and has won 35 singles titles in her career", "forbes also named her the highest-paid female athlete of all time in 2005", "she\u2019s now held that title for a record 11 or 12 years", "that is a long time", "maria garners worldwide press coverage on and off the court with a social media presence that includes 15.5 million \u2013 probably a lot more at this point \u2013 facebook fans, more than 6.5 million, 2.7 million followers on instagram", "she serves as an ambassador to many of the world\u2019s top luxury brands and a number of fortune 500 companies, including porsche, nike, avian, and head", "in 2007, she became a goodwill ambassador for the united nations development program, that\u2019s undp, and has made significant contributions to chernobyl-related projects in her native country", "in 2012, sharapova flexed her entrepreneurial muscles and debuted her eponymous couture candy collection sugarpova", "most recently, she is the author of a book titled unstoppable, my life so far", "it describes her story in detail and was done in collaboration with an incredible writer named rich cohen, which we\u2019ll get into", "but a few things that we don\u2019t get into", "we don\u2019t talk about meldonium", "we don\u2019t talk about the sponsors", "we don\u2019t talk about a handful of things

focus", "and i really hope you enjoy this as much as i did", "it was a blast, and it inspired me, in fact, among other things, to come to florida where i am right now", "i have a compression sleeve on my right arm", "why", "because i\u2019m doing tennis camp", "i\u2019m doing an intense, immersive tennis program at the human performance institute with jim loehr", "and you should definitely check out the human performance institute with jim loehr", "it\u2019s phenomenal", "and i\u2019ve been playing my little heart out in tennis, which i have always wanted to do my entire life, for the last two days, and i have a few more days to go", "but maria really piqued my interest in this sport, which i had wanted to do for so, so long and put off", "and i realized rather than doing jujitsu and all of these things that break my body, the gentle art, maybe i should try something like tennis", "golf", "not my speed", "i\u2019d rather just go for a hike", "but tennis, yeah, i like the sound of that", "and i like watching it", "so even if just to get a better appreciation of the sports that i can see the nuances and details when watching on tennis on tv \u2013 tennish said sean connery\u2026all right, i need to go have a drink and dinner", "in any case, without further ado, please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation with maria sharapova", "maria, welcome to the show", "thank you", "i am so thrilled that we were able to carve out time", "and i have so many questions", "i will start with a rather simple one", "i\u2019m sitting here drinking tea", "i\u2019m having charleston breakfast tea, and i have heard that you also enjoy tea", "is that true, and if so, what type of tea do you prefer", "what are your go-to teas", "i do", "so i grew up in russia where tea, it\u2019s a big part of our culture is drinking tea in the afternoons with your grandparents", "so i drank black tea, a darjeeling type of tea that was made in the mountains in siberia", "and i would have it with raspberry jam that my grandmother would make", "that sounds amazing", "so would you put the jam on a piece of toast and have it, or \u2013 no, i, actually, put it in my tea", "and i still do that", "and people look at me very strangely and suspiciously", "and i get it", "but it\u2019s just so many memories of my childhood", "and, yeah, i do that instead of sugar, which is pretty much the same thing", "but it allows you \u2013 it\u2019s a little messier", "it gives you permission", "and you mentioned siberia, which is where i want to go next", "you were born in siberia, as i understand it, but your mother was pregnant with you while in chernobyl", "right", "so could you explain what happened exactly", "my parents were from gomel", "it was a very small town very close to where the chernobyl reactor blew up", "and during that time, just before my mother was pregnant with me, in 1986 and they fled", "there was not a lot of information about what happened during chernobyl", "my grandparents were living in siberia at that time from my mom\u2019s side", "and they said, \u2018you need to get out of there.\u2019 they were able to get more information about the disaster itself than my parents were able to get to being so close to the area", "and they left", "and that\u2019s why i was born in siberia", "your family fled to, i guess, russia right after the explosion", "but you ended up in, i guess, a warmer place, at least depending on the season", "yes", "much warmer", "when we were about 2, my parents realized, \u2018this is not going to work out over here.\u2019 and they moved to a resort town, sochi, where they just had the winter olympics", "and i still consider it one of the most beautiful places to visit because you have the black sea, and you have the palm trees in the summer", "and just an hour away, you have these mountains where the olympics were held and some of the best skiing in the world", "my dad still skis there all of the time", "so yeah, i definitely \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most peaceful places as well", "if i go to russia \u2013 i\u2019ve never visited russia; i\u2019ve always wanted to \u2013 are there one or two places that i absolutely must visit, in your mind", "are there any particular things that i cannot miss", "i know it\u2019s a gigantic place", "right", "i would say skip siberia, and there\u2019s definitely not much to see or do over there", "but i think, from a cultural standpoint, i would definitely visit st", "petersburg", "and it is still a place that i\u2019ve never been to, if you can believe it or not, as much as i\u2019ve traveled around the world", "but my mom goes almost every year", "a lot of my relatives are there", "and i just have this enormous respect for the culture and just the city and the people and the way they live", "it\u2019s very different", "and people always ask me because i was born in russia, and i spent the first seven years of my life there, and i\u2019ve lived in the united states ever since, and i\u2019ve never really looked back into living in russia", "but so much of my heart still remains there", "obviously, all of my grandparents and my cousins also live there", "and so it\u2019s a very big part of my life", "and when people ask me what i think about the country, as much as i want to have an opinion, it is so large, and it is so vast, and there are so many opinions you can have about it", "and i really just want to let people experience it on their own and come to their own conclusions because i think that\u2019s one of the greatest things of travel is to not have expectations and to get there and to experience a new place", "but st", "petersburg is on my list, and that\u2019s definitely a city that comes highly recommended", "why have you not been there", "and maybe it\u2019s something like me growing up in new york, i had never, ever visited the empire state building or the statue of liberty until a friend from germany visited", "is it like that", "or is there another reason", "it\u2019s because of my schedule", "i compete 10 months out of the year, and i pretty much go to the same cities every year because the tournaments are all situated in those same cities", "when i have a holiday break, which usually consists of a couple of weeks only in november, i go somewhere warm", "i just escape", "i put my phone away", "i put just everything on hold a little bit and just let my body and my mind recover", "and it just never has come into my schedule", "warmer places, we talked about a few, and, of course, there\u2019s california, there\u2019s florida, and then, there\u2019s sochi", "so, going back to sochi, is that where you were first noticed", "yes", "can you tell the story of how you were first found, as it were, as it relates to tennis", "yeah", "so sochi, in the summer, it was very much a happening place", "it was a scene, and it was a lot of people were coming there on vacation", "so we had a lot of little parks and outdoor tennis courts and ferris wheels and all of these types of attractions", "and my father \u2013 who was not a great athlete but he played hockey in school \u2013 he enjoyed playing tennis", "he was not very good at all, did it for fun", "and when i was old enough to go with him \u2013 and my mother had me when she was very young", "she was only 20 years old, so she was still studying at the time", "so on weekdays when my father didn\u2019t have to work, he would take me with him to the local park", "and i would just follow along", "and we\u2019d take the public bus to the courts", "and i\u2019d just sit there, and i\u2019d watch him grind it out with a competitor of his", "and then, i\u2019d see all of these little kids playing on the side", "and they were just hitting balls against the wall", "and i didn\u2019t have a racket of my own", "and the one that i was able to get was so much bigger than myself", "so that didn\u2019t really work out", "but i \u2013 immediately something drew me to it", "something drew me to this like repetitiveness of seeing these kids try to hit the ball against the strings of the racket and see it come back from the wall", "and it was very fascinating", "it was like i had this immediate feeling of, i want to be in front of those kids, and i want to show them how it\u2019s done", "even though i had no idea what i was doing", "so i think that competitiveness kind of developed then where i was just sitting and bored and watching my father play", "i just wanted to be out there", "was it a feeling that you could do it more correctly and just something that you intuited that you felt intuitively", "or was it because you noticed flaws in their technique or things that they were missing", "i\u2019m always curious about this because one of my closest friends, his name is josh waitzkin, and the book and the movie searching for bobby fischer were based on him", "he\u2019s thought of as a chess prodigy", "and he had this experience very, very early on with chess", "of course, it might be difficult to recall what was going through your head at the time, but can you elaborate at all", "i think, from my perspective, when you\u2019re that young, and when you don\u2019t know anything about that particular activity or that sport, and it was tennis in that moment, it was really this question of, can i do that", "i see all of these kids doing it", "do i have the ability to be better than them", "and after observing so much of what my father was doing just not on any professional level at all, it just came to my mind that i wanted to do it", "and i wanted to do it better", "i think there are times in life where things come instinctually, and you just grasp it, and you notice it", "and i think my father definitely noticed", "i could have kept sitting on that bench, and i could have kept watching my father", "but there was something in me that said no, i want to be out there", "i want to be playing, and i want to be competing", "and i want to be learning", "and when i got myself out to the wall where all of the kids were hitting the ball against, i remember a coach, there was one coach there, and all of the children were going to see him", "all of the parents wanted him to tell them that they\u2019re going to be future stars", "they\u2019re going to be the next pete sampras or the next andre agassi", "and he noticed me and only after a couple of weeks of when i was playing", "and he pulled my father aside and said, \u201cthis girl can play tennis.\u201d and after that, i started taking lessons with him", "and a couple of years after that, there was an exhibition that martina navratilova was a part of", "and i was about 5 1/2 years old at that time, and the exhibition was being held in moscow", "so my father and i went to moscow", "and i was probably one out of 200 kids in that clinic that she was holding for these kids", "and after hitting a few balls, i noticed that she had come up to my father", "and i don\u2019t quite know in what language they spoke because my father didn\u2019t speak any english, and i\u2019m pretty sure she didn\u2019t have much russian", "but between the two and after she left, i spoke to my father, and he said, \u201cthis legend, martina navratilova, just came up to me and said that you\u2019re talented.\u201d and this was only after her watching me just hit a couple of balls in the midst of so many other kids", "and i look back at that because i see so many kids now", "i practice at a country club, and there are all of these \u2013 just today, i was practicing next to two little girls that are probably 7 or 8 years old just enjoying the game by themselves and trying to hit the ball over the net", "and it\u2019s hard to envision that talent", "it\u2019s hard to see it", "so for her to be able to see that when i was only 5 1/2 years old is pretty incredible", "do you have any idea, have either of the first coach or martina later told you what they saw", "have you any idea of what it was that they picked up on", "i haven\u2019t spoken to martina about it too much", "but the first coach that i had in sochi when i just started playing, he, unfortunately, passed away a few years ago", "but i definitely had this tenacity", "and i had this will of focus at a young age", "and tennis is a very repetitive sport", "so it\u2019s grinding", "it\u2019s just hitting the ball", "and when you\u2019re that young, your concentration and focus is just all over the place", "you play with the ball for a few minutes, and then you want to play with a truck, or you want to play with a doll", "and the consistency in your mind is very limited, at least that\u2019s what, when i observe kids, which is completely normal", "but i had this fascination with being able to hit the ball and seeing somebody else hit it back at me and trying to find a way \u2013 and the racket that i first had, we had to cut the grip by like 4 or 5 inches because it was so much bigger than i was", "and i could barely hold it, and it was so heavy", "so it\u2019s just this really funny scene of me trying to figure out how to \u2013 because, when you\u2019re just given a ball and a racket, well, what do i do with this now", "so i just picture myself there just trying to find a way to get the ball over the net", "and i had this determination of doing it better and better every day", "and i stuck to it", "it was never \u2013 i don\u2019t remember one day where i didn\u2019t want to go down the steps of our apartment and walk the 20 minutes uphill to get to the bus station and then have to change buses at the next station", "there was never a day when i said i don\u2019t want to do it", "and i think that\u2019s not something that you can really teach or that you could develop it, but i think i just really loved it", "and i carry that passion", "this idea that you were able to hold constant in your mind, this fascination of tennis and practice consistently, what did your \u2013 as context for myself, what did your dad do for work", "and you mentioned your mother was studying, what was she studying", "if you could tell us a little bit about them", "she was studying communications and business", "and i had a very interesting childhood because my parents were very young, and they had no knowledge of what to do", "i was the first child", "i\u2019m still the only child", "but they were very careful of what the decisions that they made and where i was going to go and if i was going to go to kindergarten or how long they wanted me to be there", "and i spent so many hours in the library with my mother while she was doing her homework", "or she was studying for an exam, and i\u2019d go with my father when he would leisurely play tennis", "my father worked in construction", "he had a fairly normal job", "i would say we were an average family getting support from both of our grandparents, from my mom\u2019s and my dad\u2019s side", "and we lived a very basic and, at that time, a very normal life", "did they expose you to a lot of other things tennis", "and some things you had zero interest in, and you had that kid-like distraction or adhd-like inability to focus or jumpy focus, and then, tennis was the one thing that you gravitated toward and really locked onto", "or were you like that with everything", "well, it happened so fast", "and because i had only started picking up the tennis racket when i was 4 years old, at the age of 6 1/2, i was already on an air flight to america", "right", "you didn\u2019t have a lot of time to test things out", "there wasn\u2019t much time to really test other things", "i loved to play with dolls", "i loved to play doctor", "i loved to read", "my mother was very much into education", "and she didn\u2019t want anything to do with tennis", "she didn\u2019t want anything to do with sports", "she danced ballet a little bit", "and she brought a lot of cultural, educational, the learning and the growing-in-your-mind experiences to me", "she would read passages and novels that i was way too young to understand", "but she made me memorize a lot of those passages", "and something about that, that repetitiveness, i never liked to do it", "but it was a sense of discipline that she taught me in a way that had nothing to do with sport", "and i think that really \u2013 i would spend an hour in the evening just memorizing these poems by pushkin and thinking to myself, when am i ever going to use this", "and little do you know, with years, especially now that i\u2019m older, discipline doesn\u2019t always come so easy", "you have to build its foundations, and you have to build the trust with the people that help you with it", "and i think her influence and her ability to acknowledge that as a young mom was so inspirational", "and that discipline really comes into play as a tennis player because you have to have so much of it", "there\u2019s sacrifice, and there are the long days", "but the discipline that you have to carry on with, whether it\u2019s a good day or a bad day, just beats everything else", "so i got chills about 47 seconds ago because i\u2019m looking at the time because i found what i was digging for", "and i wasn\u2019t looking for any particular answer, but i want to just underscore a few things that you said for people who might be parents because, of the 250-plus interviews that i\u2019ve done for this podcast, there are a couple of patterns that have emerged in people who have become really, really good at something really early", "and, ultimately, you\u2019ve really mastered anything, even for that age, 10 or 15, 20", "so the first is that i\u2019ve noticed, and it\u2019s not for everyone, but their parents talk to them, at least part of the time, about subject matter above their heads, so to speak, or as adults", "and no", "2 is a lot of exposure to books", "no", "3 was what you brought up, and this was what i got excited about, which is developing a tolerance for repetition", "and, in some cases, for that type of, i\u2019m not going to say boredom, but lack of variety in some capacity because i think that, like you said, you\u2019re training that so that it can then be applied to other things", "so you might say, \u201cwhy am i memorizing these poems", "i\u2019m never going to use these poems.\u201d but, at the same time, you\u2019re developing the ability to tolerate the thousands of hours that you\u2019re going to put into hitting a ball against a wall", "yes", "and it\u2019s the persistence that you\u2019re building", "it\u2019s the will that when \u2013 i mean, i believe in any job that we do, any work that we have in front of us, there are a lot of moments that we look forward to", "there are projects that we love and that we want to be a part of", "but then, there\u2019s the tedious work", "there\u2019s the things that \u2013 the repetition as a tennis player where you have to just \u2013 where it\u2019s all numbers, and where it\u2019s just a feeling that you get to a certain number, and you just feel it, and you let go, and you don\u2019t think", "and that\u2019s time", "and you could say, \u201ci don\u2019t want to do it", "i want to stop", "i don\u2019t want you feeding me anymore balls.\u201d but that mental persistence, i do think you can develop early", "i certainly was able to with the help of my mother", "and also when you\u2019re young \u2013 she was a very young parent", "and with the help of her mother and also culturally, i would say, 30 years ago or 25 years ago, it was very different", "and i felt like i was in her cocoon, and i was growing up in her hands, which also i think explains the bond that we have today and the friendship we were able to have from that", "and i think that\u2019s one of the most important things in my life as i travel around the world today, and i meet a lot of young girls and boys, whether they play tennis or not, and i hear their stories", "and so much of their experience is a very tough and rough childhood where they almost want to escape from what they knew as their family", "and it\u2019s so sad, personally, because the experience that i had in my childhood and it was not \u2013 i\u2019m not saying it was all butterflies and rainbows", "but as i look back at that experience and how they were handling that situation and how they were sacrificing so much for myself created this bond within my family that was very important", "and it\u2019s priceless", "and i know that those are not the people that we are able to choose in our life", "but they are the people that know us the best", "and that relationship can do so many wonders in your life", "because i feel like your mom is such an important figure and relationship, i noticed that you\u2019ve been reading memoirs written by women", "and feel free to correct anything that i get wrong", "but, most notably, love warrior by glennon doyle melton and jeannette walls\u2019s the glass castle", "and you called them \u201cvery strong, tough, emotional books.\u201d what did those two books mean to you", "why were they tough and emotional", "what did you take away from that", "i get very inspired by women", "i get very inspired by their brain, by their actions, by their toughness", "i think, in today\u2019s world, and in today\u2019s working environment, and i face this a lot in my sport where i could be going into a press conference six times in a week, and i\u2019m faced with equality questions", "and you almost have your back against the wall so many times, and you have to explain yourself, and you feel that you\u2019ve done it so many times", "can you explain that just for a second in terms of explaining yourself for equality questions", "would you tell us a little bit more about that", "equality has been a big subject in women\u2019s tennis for many, many years", "and venus williams and serena herself have done an incredible job of getting to where we are today with the help of the pioneer, billie jean king, was the reason why we make such an incredible living from what we do", "and the one thing that we as professional athletes have to realize is we\u2019re not only fighting to win a tennis match", "we\u2019re also fighting to be an example", "we\u2019re fighting for our voice", "we\u2019re fighting to have a pedestal to create that pedestal and to raise awareness of how incredible and how difficult and how each path is so unique and personal and how we\u2019re all able to come through it", "how we are able to share our stories, how we\u2019re able to inspire other people, and not just women", "it\u2019s women and men as well", "do we get enough credit for it", "i don\u2019t believe so", "and when i say that that\u2019s what we have to explain, i believe that\u2019s the feeling that i have, at least", "and i don\u2019t feel that we have the amount of support that we should be having", "i was having a conversation with a very learned man \u2013 i guess would be the easiest way to put it today \u2013 and asking him for advice on a few things", "and he said that to help the greatest number of people, become an example", "in other words, you don\u2019t have to work hand-in-hand with each individual person", "but if you have the visibility and exposure, as you do, to become an example of potential, i think that\u2019s extremely important", "but it had very unusual beginnings, all of this, in many respects, right", "and you ended up, at a very young age, at the nick bollettieri tennis academy in the us, which has produced, you mentioned, the william sisters, andre agassi, boris becker", "how did you end up there", "and could you tell us a bit about the coaching methodology because that\u2019s always what i\u2019m just so endlessly fascinated by", "so i think my father\u2019s point of view after that children\u2019s clinic that martina navratilova held was: tennis is not a big sport, at that time, in russia", "we didn\u2019t have many champions coming out of the country", "i believe, at the time, it was yevgeny kafelnikov and anna kournikova", "but, other than that, it was hockey", "it was figure skating", "it was all of the winter olympic sports", "and one, it was very expensive to find the right coaches, to find the right facilities, especially in the winter time", "so the only real option was america", "and my father started reading books and studying the game", "and he knew that he wasn\u2019t a tennis coach", "and he knew that he was a great tennis player", "and one of the biggest gifts that my father gave me, and it started from a very young age, was that he realized that he wasn\u2019t the one that was going to be my main coach", "he wasn\u2019t the one that knew everything or believed to know everything", "he wanted to get the help from others", "and so he started doing research", "and the next thing i knew, just before my seventh birthday, i was on a flight to miami, florida", "and from there, we made this crazy bus journey, four hours north, to the bollettieri academy in bradenton, florida, which has, as you just mentioned, so many of the stars, past and present and future, at the moment", "it\u2019s really a factory", "this tennis factory that\u2019s grown into other sports as well", "but, at the time, it was very tennis-specific", "and nick bollettieri was someone that came with a lot of experience and coaching experience", "and he, as a person, was a mentor to me more than anything with the guidance, with this experience of seeing so many people come in and out; so many people come in wanting to be champions turned into good", "some people come in, and they turn into great, and some just turn into champions", "and he\u2019s seen it all", "so knocking at the door of nick bollettieri academy in the dead of the night was probably one of the toughest moments in that journey", "and it really began there", "and they told us it was a little too late or a little too early to be knocking at an academy door, so they sent us to a hotel, and we ended up coming back in the morning", "and they put me in a group of kids with probably six or seven kids and an instructor watched me hit a few balls and called over nick bollettieri and said, \u201cyou have to see this girl play.\u201d and then, nick saw me play, and that\u2019s kind of where it took off", "and what makes that place so special", "and i ask because i always wonder, in the beginning, there must have been something special in the sauce because there comes a point where the best in the world gravitate to your center, if you\u2019ve produced a lot of champions", "so then, there\u2019s a question of is it created, or is it sort of a selection bias", "but what makes that place unique in terms of training, in terms of principles, or anything that makes it stand apart", "yeah", "that\u2019s a great question because i see it in two different ways", "and from a positive view, i saw it, and i still see it as, first of all, it\u2019s located in a place where there\u2019s nothing else to do", "so you are going there to be committed to become a tennis player or another sport that you might be practicing over there", "you have no distractions", "the second greatest thing about it is the amount of kids that were there that were older than i was against whom i was able to compete", "and so every afternoon, six days a week, i would play matches against them, and i would play sets", "and it was the best learning experience because creating that understanding what you do and who you are as a tennis player and those mechanics, the basics, the mind, the brain of setting up the next shot before you even hit it, that knowledge you get by playing", "and so i had this opportunity", "i\u2019d play a kid from china", "i\u2019d play a kid from europe that i was most likely \u2013 not most likely, i was one of the youngest ones at the academy", "at one point, i wasn\u2019t even allowed to board there because i was so young", "and so i had this incredible experience of coming, in terms of competition, of seeing someone across the net that was 2 feet higher than i was, that was stronger than i was", "and i had to figure out how to beat them if i wanted to have my self-esteem or be confident or be a better player", "and the other great thing was that nick himself, he knew what to say, and he knew when to say it", "and i think you can be a great coach", "and i\u2019ve had many throughout my career", "but they\u2019re not very good business people", "and nick understood that you only need just a handful, maybe a couple or a few players that could really make the academy what it is", "and i boarded with eight other girls for a long period of time", "and they weren\u2019t excited to be there", "they knew that that wasn\u2019t their future", "they sometimes didn\u2019t even know if that was their college future", "but the money that was going into that academy because of why they were there and practicing and competing was the reason why nick bollettieri was so smart", "and when you needed him, he was there", "at 5 a.m., he\u2019s there on the court", "he\u2019s the one that locks the place until this day", "and that dedication and that love and passion for what you do, it\u2019s incredible", "i just saw him a few months ago", "i spent a few weeks there training part of my comeback", "and he was out every single day", "he\u2019d come out for a few minutes", "he\u2019d sit down next to me", "he\u2019d speak to me like i was 10 years old again, and he\u2019s the same nick as he was", "it\u2019s so rare \u2013 it\u2019s really rare to see that", "and i go there for the same reasons", "i go there because of the atmosphere, because you see other athletes", "and it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re in college, if they\u2019re young, if they\u2019re not going to make it", "just to be in the environment of everyone training with a purpose, it makes you better", "it makes you \u2013 i love playing in front of a little crowd would kind of get around the court that i was practicing on", "and since i hadn\u2019t been in competition for a long period of time, it was so great to have people huddle around the court and watch my every move", "and i felt that adrenaline again because, usually, in between tournaments, i like to practice where it\u2019s a little bit more private and quiet because, at a tournament, it\u2019s a zoo", "i always compare it to being in a cage of a zoo where everyone is around you and taking your picture", "and there\u2019s sort of no escape until someone just takes you out on a golf cart and away you go", "and so when i\u2019m home, whether it\u2019s in florida or california, i just love the stillness and the quietness of just being on my own", "i don\u2019t have a court, but i go to a country club, and i practice on a corner", "or i train at a private court as well and just have your peace and quiet a little bit just to have your mind only see your team and the members of your team and then do your work and leave", "but being there for that period of time has brought back so many memories", "so a few things", "one, nick, i\u2019m sorry, i always mispronounce your name anytime i try to say it", "i think part of my spirit wants to be italian, so i try to really throw a spin on it and say \u2013 but i always make that mistake", "he would love that if you said bollettieri, he would love that", "he goes to this little, italian restaurant every single day of the week, so he would absolutely appreciate that", "oh, fantastic", "well, then, you\u2019re welcome, nick, not i\u2019m sorry", "and the next question is related to your experience early on", "you mentioned that you had these giants across the net", "meanwhile, you\u2019re this tiny kid holding this gigantic broadsword, basically, because it\u2019s so big compared to your body", "i\u2019ve heard that you had some experience being teased when you arrived in the us", "yes", "and i\u2019d love to hear you talk about that if any particular examples come to mind and just talk about what effect it had on you", "because what i have just been, mesmerized might sound weird, so don\u2019t take it as being creepy, but just focused on when i watch you play and compete is just the toughness", "and you mentioned the grinding and just the toughness that i see is something that i\u2019d like to explore", "so could you talk about the teasing when you got the us", "i very much felt like i was an outcast from the beginning", "and one of the reasons was because i had arrived in america with my father", "and our story just didn\u2019t make sense to anyone", "so from the very beginning, everyone just assumed we were crazy, which, if i look at that now, yes, we were absolutely", "my parents\u2019 decision was crazy, the fact that we come to america, and you have this 7-year-old girl with a dream to become a tennis player", "that\u2019s never going to work out", "and so i sensed that", "i felt that", "i felt that i was different", "i always felt like i was there on a different mission", "and because i was one of the youngest ones, i never had the same interests as the other girls", "and i always knew that my interest and my passion was very different to theirs", "and while i boarded, at the academy, i remember coming back from practice, and my little locker would be open", "and the only thing i had in that locker was this giant jar of little animal crackers", "the fuel of champions", "right", "which by the diet these days has changed tremendously", "i don\u2019t even know where to look when a new diet is coming out next", "but, back then, i just remember that giant jar of animal crackers that i believe a friend from the academy gave me for my birthday", "and that\u2019s the only thing that i had in that locker", "i didn\u2019t have many belongings", "i didn\u2019t have a lot of outfits or skirts that the girls had", "i didn\u2019t really have anyone to do my hair or braid my hair", "my father would sit me down on a chair and just cut my bangs straight across", "they never looked great, obviously", "he didn\u2019t know what he was doing", "so i was always a little off", "i didn\u2019t speak english, in the beginning", "i was learning through just speaking with all of the other kids because they talked so much", "you just pick it up, and you learn", "and it just made me feel very much alone", "it was not that i didn\u2019t have \u2013 it felt like i had a lot in common because we were all there to play tennis", "but the mission that i was on, and i felt like i was, was very different", "and it wasn\u2019t that i had to be a champion or i didn\u2019t have to be a champion", "it was that i was learning, and i was growing to be a better tennis player", "and i didn\u2019t know where that would take me, but i knew that, in order to get there, i had to wake up at 6 a.m., and i had to practice for the day", "and then, i would take a 30 minute nap from 12 to 12:30", "and, at 1 p.m., i\u2019d be back playing matches and sets until 4 or 5", "and then, i\u2019d have a little bit of homework, and then, i\u2019d have to do it again", "and so there was a lot of other interests that the girls had and posters and glitter and pictures and david hasselhoff and janet jackson", "and i had no clue who anyone of those was, at the time", "and so i was just a stranger", "i was sort of in my own little bubble from a very young age", "and i look back on those moments, and i\u2019ve gotten that question a lot like, \u201chow did you feel", "did you feel lonely?\u201d and one of the other things was that i didn\u2019t go to america with my mother because she didn\u2019t have a visa, so i spent the first two years in america without seeing my mom at all", "and i look back at that time, and there\u2019s nothing about it that \u2013 it\u2019s sad", "obviously, it was very sad to not have that support and not have your mother cut your bangs and stuff instead of your father or him buy you shoes that are so ugly, and you don\u2019t know how to tell him", "but he doesn\u2019t have enough money to buy you a better pair, so you just keep your mouth shut", "it didn\u2019t feel like we were doing the wrong thing", "i felt like i was on this path that i was meant to be on", "and i didn\u2019t feel lonely", "i didn\u2019t feel sad", "it was a lonely time because, i look at that, and of course i was an outcast", "but when you\u2019re on a mission to do something or be something, and it\u2019s not so much about success", "i think it\u2019s just we always think of having a vision", "and, of course, we have goals, and we plant it in our minds", "but i never remember one time where my father told me that i have to win wimbledon or that i had to win the us open", "he never made me feel that, if i didn\u2019t, that the world would end", "and i always remember thinking that, if this doesn\u2019t work out, and we would go to russia and that\u2019s absolutely fine because i felt like i had a completely normal childhood when i was living there", "did you feel any pressure in the sense, not from your parents directly, but in the recognition of what they were sacrificing for you to take a stab at tennis", "or was that just not a factor at all", "whatever they did, they never made me feel like it was", "and i think that\u2019s one of the reasons why i never felt the pressure of having to win things or having to earn money", "i knew that i didn\u2019t know how much money i could earn", "i was never really interested in that", "i didn\u2019t know anything that would come with being a successful tennis player", "and you never really do", "and i think that\u2019s one of the great things in life is that you don\u2019t know", "and it\u2019s an experience, and it\u2019s for you to experience and for you to acknowledge and for you to learn from it", "and whether you want to take it or not, that\u2019s up to you", "it\u2019s in your own hands", "but the fact that they gave me this opportunity to create a life for myself is incredible", "and now, my father remained kind of the leader and the coach of my tennis until i was 21 years old", "he traveled with me to every single tournament", "and after i won my third grand slam, it was very mutually, he decided to stop", "and now he\u2019s on a permanent vacation", "and he thinks he\u2019s training for the senior olympics", "and he loves to ski and hike and do all of those great things", "and i\u2019m so happy", "and it makes me just incredibly grateful that i can support that and that i can do that for my mom, and that i can do that for my dad, for my extended family", "and they\u2019re the reason why i\u2019m able to do that", "is it true that you\u2019ve never used the word rejection or that you don\u2019t believe in that word", "is that true", "well, it\u2019s a very tough word to believe in", "it\u2019s a very tough word to accept", "i think one of the reasons is because i saw, in many different scenarios, where my father would say no because he would open up an opportunity to say yes", "and \u2013 okay, please explain", "so there are many situations, whether it was a coaching opportunity, or whether it was receiving money from an agency, he had this ability to say no to the things that they made sense, like the easy way out, because he believe that later, he\u2019d have a better opportunity to say yes to bigger and greater things", "got it", "so he said no to the small, shiny objects in front of him", "well, at the time, i\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t seem so small", "not small, i don\u2019t mean at the time and perception, but the short term, shiny objects maybe", "right", "so rejection, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 there was never \u2013 because i always was following and kind of next to my father and seeing the decisions that he would make", "i was only a kid", "and even when i won wimbledon, i was only 17 years old", "you\u2019re still a kid", "and you\u2019re still following the guidance", "and i\u2019d win a match following that, or i\u2019d win a tournament, and i\u2019d go shopping in a store, and i\u2019d call my mom because there was something quite pricey, and i didn\u2019t know if i could buy it", "and so i was still asking permission, even though i had earned that money, if i could purchase a piece of jewelry or shoes or whatever it was, at the time that i won", "and so i was always watching and observing", "and they never \u2013 rejection, of course, when someone says no to you, it\u2019s easy to say, yes, i was rejected", "but if you can open up a different opportunity from that point of view, then, you\u2019re turning a no into something that brought you to a better place", "it sounds like you did that with your interactions with some of the other players who were boarding at nick\u2019s tennis academy in a way", "yeah", "do you consider yourself an introvert, an extrovert, a blend", "how do you think about that", "i think, from a very young age, sort of the process that i went through and the success that i earned from a young age and winning a major and a grand slam at such a young age, and because it became so unexpected, i went from being someone that people scouted to being someone that everyone had analyzed and knew about and wanted to know more of", "and i created this \u2013 i definitely put on these horse blinders because, if i had not, my mind would have been everywhere", "and i think it would have been so easy to be distracted in those moments and situations and be pulled in different directions, which it\u2019s a slippery slope", "it\u2019s very dangerous", "and, as a young girl, it could have been a disaster, to say the least", "and so i definitely remember the moment, and it was just a few matches before i won wimbledon, when i was sitting down with my coach", "and i think it was before the semifinals of that tournament", "and all of these tourists who had gotten credentials \u2013 they seemed like tourists, i didn\u2019t know who they were", "maybe they weren\u2019t", "maybe they were important agents or sponsors", "but, at the time, they just seemed like tourists that wanted a picture with me", "and it really came overnight", "and that sense of, wow, everyone all of a sudden wants something", "everyone wants something that you have", "everyone wants to be a part of your success", "i didn\u2019t like that feeling", "i loved the feeling of being in a position of showcasing what i could do with my tennis racket", "but that feeling of everyone wanting a piece of that, and the feeling of your opponents all of a sudden feeling like, just by beating her, they\u2019re not just winning a quarter final or a final of a match, but they\u2019re winning so much more", "it made me feel like i needed to kind of put myself in a bubble, to concentrate, to focus", "that it was going to be that much harder, that much more difficult", "and i did", "and i don\u2019t know if i could have done it another way", "what were some of the \u2013 or what are some of the best practices or decisions that have helped you with that", "for instance, my friend josh that i was mentioning earlier who became well known, effectively overnight, particularly with the movie about his life, for chess", "he could no longer compete effectively after that because he would go to a chess tournament, and there would be \u2013 i\u2019m making up the age \u2013 but he\u2019s something like 13 or 14", "and all of a sudden, there are 20 girls who want his attention and a bunch of reporters", "and he removed himself completely from the competitive scene", "he\u2019s one of the most private people i know, at this point", "so what helped you", "what kind of decisions or advice or practices", "i think it was surrounding myself with good minds and good people that had my best interest", "and it\u2019s so easy to say those words, but i know how difficult it is to find those people and even harder nowadays than it was", "and i saw it in so many different examples of other tennis players and of their success and their paths after that and the people that you, all of a sudden, associate yourself with", "i think, as an individual, it\u2019s very easy to be affected by the voices that are next to you because we listen to that", "and we process that information", "and, all of a sudden, i won\u2019t say we want to be like them, but we interpret it in our way", "but when i read a funny book, all of a sudden, i feel like i\u2019m a comedian", "or when i watch an incredible acting by someone, it inspires me to be an actor", "it\u2019s like there\u2019s moments of this that happens, as an athlete, you surround yourself with peoples\u2019 opinions or choices or money and wealth", "and it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s such an easy distraction", "and i surrounded myself with good people", "and the friends that i have today were my friends when i was a young girl, that my manager has managed me since i was 11 years old", "and now, my mom is still very much my best friend and another really good friend of mine i met with i was 11 years old as well", "so i have this fondness of developing those real connections with people", "and i think it was so helpful for me, as a young girl, because i competed in front of thousands of people, and i still do", "and the walk to the tunnel and the walk to a press conference, and the walk back in the hotel room, it\u2019s a very lonely journey", "and it\u2019s a difficult \u2013 you\u2019re in your mind a lot, and you\u2019re thinking a lot", "so when you have voices next to you that are the right voices, then, it\u2019s so helpful", "but i know how hard it is to find", "but i do believe that that is a big part of my success", "i have some public exposure and have found i\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes and found it really difficult to identify, in some cases, what ulterior motives are or if people start doing me tons of favors, i now realize there might be something coming six months later", "so i\u2019m very hesitant to accept favors", "but i can\u2019t even imagine the level", "i\u2019m playing t-ball, and you\u2019re in the major leagues in the world series when it comes to how many people want a piece of you", "and how do you, for instance, assess someone if you have coffee or lunch with them", "what do you look out for or look for", "how do you decide whether it\u2019s someone you want to see a second time or talk to a second time", "if anything comes to mind, and this is just because, quite frankly, you\u2019ve had a lot more practice \u2013 because you\u2019ve had a lot of requests", "well, you\u2019ve had a lot more practice than i have", "i saw that email back you sent", "i was like wow", "about automatic reply", "i was like, oh, my goodness", "yeah", "i don\u2019t know who is emailing you", "i\u2019m afraid i have 4,091 unread email in my inbox currently", "it was released into the wild", "i can\u2019t do that", "i need to keep my inbox clean", "then i feel like i have a mess in my head", "we\u2019ll talk about that next", "but, in the meantime \u2013 so how do i choose", "i think it\u2019s about \u2013 i love meeting people, and i love having conversation, and i love being inspired", "and you can get so much out of a conversation by exposing yourself to being in an unfamiliar territory", "and i\u2019ll give you an example that i felt like it was important because i\u2019m always around the same people", "so i have my team, which is my coach and my fitness coach and my trainer", "and we travel", "i see them more than my family", "we travel probably 260 days out of the year together, breakfast, lunch, dinners, practice, training", "we know so much of each other, and then, you have a manager", "and then, you come home, and you have your friends", "so i\u2019m always surrounded by people that i know and that i trust and that i love, which is incredible", "but i always think that, as a human being and from a perspective of the mind and growth and intellectually, when you\u2019re put in a situation where you\u2019re unfamiliar with people, and you\u2019re unfamiliar with their stories or who they are, and you have to ask questions to get that out, it makes you a much more interesting person", "and so last year, i put myself in this position where i had all of this time off", "and it was during the summer", "and i signed up for these two business courses in boston at harvard business school", "and i was one out of the 40 students, i believe, in each of these courses", "and i stayed on campus", "and these were individuals who were ceos and coos of companies, of airlines, of microsoft, of all of these incredible brands", "and i was, by far, the youngest and probably the silliest and the least knowledgeable one in the room", "but just by being with them, just by sitting with them, just by sitting with them at dinner, by asking them questions, by feeling a little bit uncomfortable, i felt like, at the end of those three weeks, i grew and i grew", "and it wasn\u2019t that \u2013 there were definitely things that i learned that i\u2019m applying and that i wanted to apply in my business", "but the biggest thing that i got out of it was that i grew as a person", "i became familiar in a very unfamiliar territory", "i still keep in touch with people in the classes", "we have completely different lives", "they\u2019re ceos of companies", "they have three or four kids", "they travel all over the place", "and here i am, a 30-year-old athlete", "but there\u2019s so much respect in that room because we\u2019re all trying to learn and to grow", "and so when you asked me, \u201cwho are the people that you want to meet with or speak to or have a coffee with?\u201d, i always think of that", "and the people that i choose to be with are the people that i want to learn from and that i want to have a conversation with and not just about what they bought at the flea market or how they like their coffee", "but it\u2019s about the world, and it\u2019s about education, and it\u2019s about people", "and it\u2019s not about right or wrong", "i don\u2019t always have conversation because i want to know what makes someone perfect", "i like to hear opinions", "and i got out of that experience in boston", "and i felt like i grew", "i felt like i stepped up, and i got out of my comfort zone, and i followed up with them", "and we still keep in touch about business and projects and things like that", "so it was a very interesting experience personally for me", "what i like about your answer, and what i think is healthy for me to hear, quite frankly, is that i frame the question by focusing on what to cut out", "how do you avoid this", "how do you find red flags for that", "what do you look for, ulterior motive, fill in the blank", "and somebody said to me two days ago that that is a very male way of approaching trying to solve problems", "to find the cancer and cut it out", "to remove it", "to put it off", "and the way you answered the question was, you didn\u2019t explicitly say this, but, \u201chere\u2019s how i choose who to spend time with.\u201d not, \u201chere\u2019s how i decide who to avoid.\u201d but by no means does that come with guarantees that you\u2019re not going to be disappointed at the end of it, or that they\u2019re going to want something from you that you weren\u2019t expecting", "right", "but you do, in order to \u2013 you have to put yourself in a position to find out", "and what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen from it", "you don\u2019t reply, or you don\u2019t answer, or you don\u2019t get back to them", "okay", "right", "it\u2019s an acceptable cost or tax to pay", "now, so the reframing that you just did, this is, for me right now, in my life at least, the really important stuff", "and i suspect this is true for a lot of folks", "and i\u2019d love to switch gears a little bit and just ask you about self talk", "so what you\u2019re saying to yourself \u2013 and i\u2019ll choose something very specific: when you are in a competitive situation, if you look back at your competitive career up to this point, when you\u2019ve been down and then come back to win versus when you\u2019ve been down and then lost, how does your self talk differ", "can you think of any examples", "are there certain things that you repeat to yourself consistently when you come back and win versus maybe things you forget to say or ways that you slip up when you end up losing", "is there any pattern to that or consistency", "i can say there is a pattern because every \u2013 what\u2019s great about the sport that i play and the situations that i\u2019m in is that they\u2019re all very unique", "and that\u2019s what makes it so exciting to do this after so many years and after being this child prodigy", "and when i think about the motivation that i\u2019m able to have until this day, and until that fire is burning, i\u2019ll always keep playing", "but that\u2019s the unique part of it is that every day is different", "every match is different", "you might be confident", "you might be ready", "you might be healthy, but you never know what\u2019s going to happen", "and i\u2019m someone that loves certainty", "i love certainty in my life, and i do enjoy having a plan", "but that\u2019s not realistic", "and there\u2019s so much uncertainty in what i do", "so i know that i can prepare my best", "i know that i can prepare my body, i can prepare my mind", "but in any situation that i\u2019m in, it\u2019s always different", "and you have to react to it differently", "and it doesn\u2019t always go according to play", "and i don\u2019t always find myself being positive", "but something that i noticed in my mind was actually in the last match i played", "and it was in a match where i got injured at the end of it and, actually, i was up in the third set in rome", "and i came into the match being a little bit upset", "i was down", "and just for other reasons", "and i knew the framework that i had in my mind was that \u2013 it was something along the words of, i can\u2019t, i can\u2019t, i can\u2019t", "i\u2019m not able to", "i don\u2019t feel well", "i\u2019m not there", "my mind is not present", "and the second that i changed that, and i changed it to, i will, and i kept saying to myself, i will win the match, and i will win the match", "it was like the instance i remember being down a break point", "and, automatically, there was something in my body language where my mind, just the repetition of what i was saying to myself, it just triggered my body", "i became more aggressive", "i stepped into the court", "i took her second serve, and i hit a winner", "and, from that point, it changed", "in the end of the match, i was up i believe it was 2-0 something", "i tore a muscle in my hip, and i had to give her the match", "but i noticed this crazy change, which i don\u2019t really notice as much", "and it was amazing that it just came", "this was the question that you just phrased, but it was the last match that i had played", "but it happens a lot", "i do a very \u2013 so i do take my time in between in my service games", "i walk to the baseline", "i move my strings around", "i do a little pep talk, and it\u2019s very automatic", "i wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s something crazy or something \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be crazy", "what is the pep talk", "i think it\u2019s more of putting my eyes onto my strings and having this repetition that, it doesn\u2019t matter if i won the point or lost the point", "but i\u2019m just on this level, that i\u2019m on this path, that i\u2019m on this river that is going to get to where it\u2019s going no matter what rock is in the way, no matter what storm is on the way", "the water is, ultimately, going to go down the river", "and maybe pep talk is not the right way", "i do think that our mind is always working, always saying things, and you\u2019re not always so conscious of it", "but it\u2019s this routine that i have, and i think it\u2019s kind of a safe place for me because, in a match, it can be an hour match, or it can be a three-hour match", "and, in tennis, momentum changes so much just like in life", "one second everything is positive, and you get bad news", "and someone is leaving the company or someone is not going to work anymore or someone is not healthy", "and, all of a sudden, you go from a great day to, wow", "and it\u2019s just a way for me", "i see those strings, and i see my fingers playing with those strings, and i think of being level-headed and being not overly excited", "not down, but being in this medium frame of mind", "i would love to dig into, specifically, and this is related to serving", "and you\u2019ll start to notice a theme here that this is also very self-interested because i\u2019ve never learned how to play tennis despite the fact that i grew up out on long island surrounded by people on tennis courts, most of which i was not allowed on", "i would serve their coffee", "but i\u2019m going to my first tennis camp in the next few months to try to learn to play tennis", "and what recommendations would you have \u2013 don\u2019t do it", "wear sunscreen", "besides don\u2019t do it because i\u2019ve already jumped off the cliff, and i\u2019m trying to grow wings", "for serving because i think you\u2019ve hit up to 121-mile-an-hour serves, which just makes my eyes spin inside of my skull", "i can\u2019t even imagine what that looks like", "any tips for the people out there", "i\u2019ll de-personalize, not tim, but actually for tim", "the people out there who would like to be better at serving, do you have any recommendations, dos or do nots", "the one thing that i notice a lot with people that are just starting to play tennis, and it\u2019s not just about the serve, but it\u2019s in all strokes, is that they take their eye off the ball in order to see the result or where the ball is going, which is a big mistake in the beginning, especially because the more eye contact you have with the ball, the more the strings of your racket are going to be on the ball itself", "so seeing the lines of the ball, visualizing that, will really help you", "kind of maintaining when you lift your arm up to hit a serve", "sometimes we want to bring it right back down as we make contact", "so keeping that left arm up is something that i focus on when i make a few errors", "as a right-hander", "yeah, as a right-hander, or if it\u2019s a left-hander, then keeping your right arm up", "i would say those are the two top things", "by the way, i am the worst at coaching", "i don\u2019t believe that", "i don\u2019t believe it for a second", "please do because it\u2019s so true", "someone asked me the other day, \u201cwould you ever consider coaching?\u201d i was like, \u201coh, my goodness, no.\u201d you\u2019re like, i\u2019ve had enough tennis on one side", "i\u2019d probably rather commentate", "i think you just don\u2019t like talking about yourself", "i don\u2019t", "but you are \u2013 i think you probably are a very good coach", "if you\u2019re a good player, you can be, i think, if you get the right questions, maybe a good coach", "so i\u2019m going to try", "so where do you think tennis players don\u2019t \u2013 let\u2019s just say novice, intermediate \u2013 waste a lot of time", "where do they focus too much or spend too much time on", "and where should they spend more time", "i think they spend a lot of time on the outcome", "i think that a lot goes into the result", "is it in", "is it out", "is it long", "is it in the net", "and it, all of a sudden, becomes your focus", "it becomes your focus point", "that\u2019s why i mentioned watching the ball as long as you can because it takes your mind away from thinking if the ball is going to be in or out", "and therefore, i always feel that your attitude and your body language, i\u2019ve always that that\u2019s a very big part of the game itself and how you\u2019re able to transfer this body language from a mistake into a winner that you hit in just the next ball or in a few balls", "and sometimes, that\u2019s all it takes because tennis is a matter of really millimeters", "you could do the same thing, and the ball, the wind takes it and it\u2019s long", "and if you\u2019re playing in conditions where it\u2019s not windy, you do the same exact thing, and you have the same technique, but it goes in", "and one day, you\u2019re cursing at yourself and you\u2019re upset, and then next day, you think you just won a grand slam", "so it\u2019s a very thin line", "there\u2019s no doubt about it", "but i think there\u2019s a lot of attitude that needs to calm down", "when i watch junior tournaments, when i watch body language, when i see facial expressions and looking over on the sides of the court", "and a lot of it is because tennis is so emotional and it\u2019s so in the moment", "and every single point counts", "and you want it to count", "and, of course, it shows how passionate you are about it", "but the attitude is a very important part of being a tennis player", "in addition to the attitude, or layered on top of the attitude \u2013 and i half-promise this will be my last question about technique \u2013 in the first month, if you were coaching your son or daughter in tennis, and let\u2019s just assume they said, \u2018the last thing i want to do is tennis.\u2019 and then, at age 20, they\u2019re like, \u2018actually, i want to do tennis\u2019 \u2013 well, they can just get an instructor", "just because dealing with a little kid is a whole thing in and of itself", "but we could also de-personalize it and just say you were teaching someone you care about, right", "right", "what would you make sure they get right in the first four weeks", "what would you really focus on", "so i think the basic techniques", "and even when you\u2019re young, that\u2019s the main thing", "those are your fundamentals", "so if you need to go right, and you\u2019re going to big sur, but you turn left, from the beginning, you\u2019re done", "and that\u2019s how i\u2019ve always seen tennis is that the mechanics are important, and they need to be easy", "sometimes i see strokes that are so complicated and that are so \u2013 the back swing is huge, and the spins are crazy, and i think it definitely can be much more simple", "and it\u2019s not about power", "it\u2019s not about hitting a winner", "a lot of it is controlled power", "i play very aggressive and powerful game", "but when i play the best is when it\u2019s controlled power, when i don\u2019t want it to be power, but when my strokes are simple, when they\u2019re not complicated, when i\u2019m not trying to grunt as loud as i can, even though i grunt very loud", "when it\u2019s really compact, keeping your elbow close to your body instead of having this huge loop", "and really zoning-in on the ball", "i always see people take their eyes off the ball", "well, i hate to say it, but i think your next book might be about tennis technique", "i doubt it", "so i\u2019m not going to forget to mention it, but i do want to mention it", "you have a new book", "and i have more questions", "i won\u2019t keep you here five hours as much as i want to", "but you have a new book, unstoppable, which i am, actually, extremely, extremely excited to read", "and my listeners know, i do not actually always say that", "i\u2019m very excited to dig into it", "but can you tell us a little bit about it", "and then, i will give one of many reasons why i\u2019m excited to check it out", "but could you tell us a) why write a book", "because books are a pain in the ass, and i can speak from experience", "well, i didn\u2019t know that", "now that i\u2019ve just finished reading the audio version, and i know it\u2019s completed, i just took a deep breath, and i said, \u201cwow.\u201d i have so much respect for every book that\u2019s on that shelf in front of me right now", "you\u2019re like, i can\u2019t believe people do this for a living", "who would ever do that", "but, you know what", "about 2 1/2 years ago, i had a meeting with an agent", "and i sat down, and she came into the meeting talking to me about a potential memoir", "and it was so far", "it was just an idea that she had", "it was not really even a vision or a plan", "she just wanted to talk to me about it", "she knew a little bit about my story, about moving to america", "she didn\u2019t know everything", "and we had this conversation, and i came into the meeting actually just taking the meeting because i wanted to be nice", "and i never thought that i was ready to write a book and to share so much of what i share in this book about moving to america, about facing my rivals, about my personal life, about all of the experiences that i\u2019ve had in the 30 years that i\u2019ve lived", "and i wrote a few paragraphs myself", "and it was interesting because i left a meeting feeling like, wow, i\u2019m really going to write a book, aren\u2019t i", "and it wasn\u2019t anything that she said", "it was just the conversation and her asking me about my story", "and as i started speaking about it, her eyes lit up, and she said it was incredible", "and i looked at her like, huh, really", "because, i don\u2019t know, i think that everyone\u2019s story is special, and everyone gets to where they are in their own certain unique ways", "and i just don\u2019t go about my life thinking that i know that it\u2019s very different and that it\u2019s maybe one in a million and that my family took a chance", "but i don\u2019t walk around thinking, wow, this is brilliant", "and so i walked out of that meeting thinking, wow, i might be a writer", "i might write a book", "and so i wrote a few paragraphs myself", "and, in just a few weeks\u2019 time, we got this offer with no questions asked", "no, is this going to be gossip", "no, who is going to be part of the story", "i signed with sarah crichton at fsg, and she wanted to hear my story", "and i don\u2019t know", "it inspired me", "it made me feel like there was a lot of inspirational work that i could put on paper for people to read", "there was a writer that i had in mind whose name is rich cohen, who you\u2019re very familiar with", "i am", "you made such a great choice", "that was one of the things i was going to bring up", "just for people who don\u2019t know, and i hate to interject, but this is another thing that made me so excited", "rich has written just some incredible books", "jerry weintraub\u2019s book was incredible", "and also the fish that ate the whale, which a lot of people have heard of", "two or three friends, one of their favorite books of all time", "so i\u2019ll let you carry on", "but rich, you made a great choice", "when i read jerry weintraub\u2019s book somewhere on holiday during my off season in november probably i\u2019d say seven years ago, i said to myself that if i ever write a book, that rich cohen would help me do it", "and when i made the decision to write this book, i had my agent find out who rich cohen was, where he lived, what he did, if he had time to do this", "i didn\u2019t even know if this was a possibility", "so i met him, and this is so fascinating because i met with three writers", "and i met him at this swanky new york hotel", "and he walked in there just looking like he did not belong", "and i knew exactly that this was my guy", "that\u2019s my guy", "that\u2019s my guy", "i knew that he knew where he was going, he took the train, he had his shoulder bag on", "and he was just looking around", "he was simple", "and our conversation was very simple", "it wasn\u2019t anything over the top", "but i knew that just meeting with him for 30 minutes, that he was a genius in his literature", "and that\u2019s where his genius has come out", "it\u2019s on paper", "and i got that sense from the beginning", "and another reason i chose to work with him was because, throughout my life, i have been influenced by a lot of male figures", "my father, my coaches, nick bollettieri, robert lansdorp, and my manager", "and i wanted rich to sit down with these people", "i wanted him to sit down with these people to really get an understanding of the characters that were part of my life that made me who i am today", "and i thought of these people", "i thought of my father, and i thought of the person that he would give the time to, that he would open up to, that he would share with", "and i think that was one of the biggest reasons that i \u2013 he and my father spent over a week together just talking and talking", "and it wasn\u2019t even \u2013 life talking, stories", "my father was able to tell stories that i read in the book, and i was like, wow, wow", "i was so young that i don\u2019t remember it", "and, yeah, he was \u2013 we spent so many weeks together", "i love the way that he worked", "i loved the questions that he would \u2013 i just loved the simplicity of him as a human being", "i love the filter also", "it wouldn\u2019t have even occurred to me, at least in this conversation, if you hadn\u2019t mentioned it", "but the fact that it\u2019s not just who you like and whose writing you like, but who other people will talk to", "because a big part of my story is the other people that influenced my life", "and because i started my life at such a young age, i started this crazy move, and this crazy profession, and these people were so influential", "and they\u2019re very much a part of this, a part of the reason that i\u2019m here", "unstoppable, my life so far", "many, you have a lot of decades left", "well, i wanted it to be called \u2018to be continued\u2019", "and i got shut down really fast", "they were like, that\u2019s basically telling everyone to get a new book", "i was like, wait a second, that\u2019s been my dream ever since i \u2013 because when i would see memoirs or autobiographies written by younger individuals, i would think to myself, do they really think that their life is over and that this is all they have to tell", "so of course, when you say that, you have a book come out, a memoir when you\u2019re 30 years old", "and i had this vision of calling it \u2018to be continued\u2019", "but they were like, you have to explain what\u2019s inside the pages and not what\u2019s coming out next", "and i was like, no", "what you could do\u2026so you could have this unstoppable, my life so far, and then you write your coaching book that you promised me you\u2019d write", "then the third book can be unstoppable, my life continues or it continues", "so i think you could get a number of things", "i can play with it, i know", "you can play with it", "we have many different titles", "i\u2019d love to ask some micro questions just about routine and perhaps a couple of other rapid-fire questions that i\u2019d like to ask", "before i get to that, i know you\u2019ve had some shoulder issues in your life", "i\u2019ve had shoulder reconstructive surgery and improved mobility and recovered largely", "good luck with that serve, if you\u2019ve had that", "yeah, i know", "fortunately, it\u2019s on my non-dominant arm", "oh, that\u2019s good", "but i was going to ask you", "you mentioned some of your team, the fitness coach and so on", "what have you found to help most", "or are there any particular exercises that have made you more resilient against injury", "so for injury prevention, what are some of the components of, say, your fitness program that you think have helped most", "i like that you used the word \u2018prevention\u2019 because a lot of the makeup of an athlete is about prevention", "and we do so much to try to prevent injuries", "and we don\u2019t always succeed", "but a big part of the little exercises and the tedious things and the repetition is that", "and i would say the biggest component \u2013 because i went through shoulder surgery \u2013 is the consistency of keeping up with the exercises", "there\u2019s a lot of exercise out there", "and they\u2019re all great exercises", "but it\u2019s very rare that you keep doing them", "and i start every morning, after my shoulder surgery, before every practice i have a routine with a rubber band", "that\u2019s not a rare routine for a tennis player", "we all warm up", "we do about a 30-minute warmup before we even get to warm up on the court before a match", "so there are a lot of little scapula exercises that you do", "and this is with a thera-band", "a thera-band, right, yeah", "and a lot of it is not even about the weight that you have or the resistance of the thera-band, but it\u2019s the repetition that you do so the feeling that you have in the back of your scapula or in the tendons of your shoulder is that it starts burning", "that\u2019s when you really know that the little muscles in between the big ones are firing", "and the more consistent you are with that, the bigger chance of you getting healthy and also preventing something else to happen because your body always compensates", "so if i have an injury in one place, your body \u2013 the brain is so smart that it starts using other parts of the body", "and, all of a sudden, you feel it somewhere else", "yeah", "so the consistency of following through and really keeping at it is, for me, always the most challenging thing", "and i see people give up on it", "what about for the lower body", "are there any particular exercises that you\u2019d wished you\u2019d incorporated earlier", "so i grew very fast", "and that\u2019s something that i speak about in the book as well because none of \u2013 no one in my family is tall", "i\u2019m the tallest one", "and i talk about the struggles that i had as a teenager during that period of time", "and my father says i grew because i had this will to grow and that i needed it for my sport and that it was everyone\u2019s wish, including mine, that i would be taller so i could serve from a higher angle or that i could be more powerful", "but with that comes you\u2019re a little bit less explosive", "you\u2019re not as mobile", "you\u2019re a little stiffer", "and i think movement, in tennis, you have so many movements that are just back and forth and changing direction", "and so i work a lot on the joints", "i work a lot on balance", "balance of the core and then balance on little unstabilizing platforms where i really work my ankles and my knees, make sure those are all aligned and not wobbling too much", "just gaining the confidence", "and, sometimes, they seem like simple exercises", "if you take a picture of them or a video of them, and they\u2019re the ones that you don\u2019t want to post because someone will think you\u2019re not doing anything", "you know what i mean", "they\u2019re not impressive looking", "yeah, you\u2019re not doing an olympic weightlifting maneuver", "no", "you\u2019re not doing any rdls", "but the little things that take time and that look so simple and that are boring are the ones that really, not only do you keep your focus, but you keep your strength and the balance", "and i work on my core a lot because i do believe it\u2019s the center of your body, and it controls so much of \u2013 it puts the body together", "it\u2019s like the glue", "if you could only choose one or two core exercises to do, what would they be", "oh, wow", "i love using the trx band, that yellow band and putting it up \u2013 hanging it and putting my feet in it and doing the planks", "yes", "and then sort of doing bicycles while you\u2019re in a plank when your feet are in the trx", "i like that", "so you\u2019re crossing your midline with your knee", "yes", "yes, that\u2019s a fantastic exercise", "that\u2019s a little bit on the advanced side, but i know that your audience can do it", "yeah", "and you can also folks, if you have really tough top of your feet, you can do that", "i actually have some rings that i\u2019m looking at outside on my patio set up at sort of push-up height", "and you can do something very, very similar", "exactly", "and i do a lot on the physio ball", "and that\u2019s always simple", "most gyms have it", "even just the \u2013 also known as a swiss ball if people are \u2013 a swiss ball, yes", "there are a lot of terms", "yeah", "i like doing all different types of planks or just floor planks and extending your arms or extending your legs one at a time out", "so it\u2019s a kind of element of surprise in balance where it\u2019s not just static", "right", "and for those of you who have heard my conversations with dr", "peter attia, he is a huge fan of doing different plank motions on the physio ball", "and just to your point about unimpressive exercises, so i have completely changed my lower-body performance and just stability in the last six months using slant boards, which make you look like you\u2019re on the most unenjoyable drug imaginable", "but it\u2019s this tiny, tiny adjustment that i feel like has changed my entire lower body by focusing on the feet", "exactly", "so here, here", "now, i\u2019m also looking at them right now, i have a bottle of geranium essential oil, i know it\u2019s not a [inaudible] [01:31:48], but bare with me", "okay", "i have a geranium because it was recommended to me by somebody named nicholas mccarthy who is a one-handed concert pianist who uses geranium when he is writing and composing because he found it helped keep him alert without over-stimulating him", "so he was relaxed and alert", "so at some point, i saw a video of you when you were 14, a star in the making", "essential oils", "that\u2019s right", "candles and aromatherapy", "candles and essential oils", "oh, i still love that stuff", "are you still into that", "i am", "you should see the room that i\u2019m in right now", "i have all of these oils and all of these candles", "yeah", "well, for me, it\u2019s about this feeling of being in your home environment and comfort", "and that\u2019s something that you don\u2019t get when you travel so much", "so when i do, it\u2019s kind of my way of feeling \u2013 every morning, i turn on my incense and my candles, and i have my coffee", "it\u2019s like the smell of being home", "what\u2019s the go-to morning incense", "it\u2019s a moroccan scent", "i don\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s in it, but it smells like i\u2019m in morocco, even though i\u2019ve never been there", "another one that\u2019s on my list", "do you not bring those smells with you when you travel", "i don\u2019t", "interestingly enough, when i go on a trip, i know that that\u2019s my work", "i like leaving those things behind because it makes me feel that i\u2019m going there for a reason, and i\u2019m not going there to be comfortable", "i\u2019m not going to be there in my environment", "i\u2019m there to do my job", "and i will come back home, and i\u2019ll have everything", "i\u2019ll have my friends, and i\u2019ll be around my family", "but when i leave, it\u2019s like there are so many times when i\u2019ve left, and i\u2019ve gone on a plane, and it\u2019s the middle of the day in manhattan beach, and the sun is shining, and everyone is playing volleyball", "and i look at that, and i\u2019m like, it\u2019s hard", "it\u2019s definitely hard", "my friends are out there, and i want to be out there", "and i want to be enjoying the sunset", "but i know what i\u2019m going out there for", "i know that, come a time when i have five days off, i\u2019ll be able to take my friends on vacation and treat them to a beautiful time", "but now is my time to work", "and so i like leaving those things behind because it makes me feel that there is a prize at the end of it", "there is something that makes my job different", "i don\u2019t know if that makes sense", "it makes perfect, 100 percent sense to me", "and it actually relates to something that made me smile when i read it", "i was looking at a transcript of a conversation that you had", "and this requires a little bit of context, but i\u2019ll shorten it", "i hate the word \u2018balance\u2019", "what is balance", "because it\u2019s 50/50 that means you\u2019re only giving 50 percent to both things", "so i\u2019ve always disliked the phrase \u2018work/life balance\u2019 because it implies blending to me", "and i like to keep them very, very separate", "right", "do you think that\u2019s something that has helped you more than hurt you or challenged you in terms of relationships, outcomes, and everything else", "do you think there will be a point where you trade that or change your mind about that", "i definitely think that it\u2019s challenged me", "it\u2019s challenged the way that i think", "but i read the one thing a few years ago by gary keller", "and it kind of hit home for me when you say that when you wake up in the morning, you put your focus on this one thing of what you want to accomplish during the day, which seems like a no-brainer", "it seems like that\u2019s the way that everyone should do it", "but it\u2019s so much more complicated than that", "for example, when i leave for a trip, and one of my good friends is getting married in august, and i\u2019m going to be either in cincinnati or toronto competing at a tournament, i know that i\u2019m not there for my friend", "it\u2019s a big day", "it\u2019s a big event", "and yet, i have this career in front of me that is taking priority", "and i could give many examples of my personal life as well", "but those are choices", "those are your choices", "and those are, i think \u2013 i don\u2019t think that there is a 50/50 balance", "that hasn\u2019t worked for me", "i\u2019ve always felt that i\u2019ve had to let something go or sacrifice something", "if i\u2019m just 50/50, i\u2019m never 100 percent", "and i want to be 100 percent", "when you train hours on end, when you give so much of your body and your mind to this one profession, and whether it\u2019s me playing tennis, whether it\u2019s something else, i don\u2019t want to come into one of the biggest moments and biggest stages of my career and feel that i didn\u2019t do everything that i could", "right", "and i do think that some people are okay with that feeling, but i am not", "and that\u2019s my choice", "and it all comes down to choice", "i think we all have them", "but as long as i\u2019m able to say, and i do believe that it\u2019s for other people as well, as long as we commit to that choice and not regret that choice or don\u2019t allow ourselves to regret that choice, then that\u2019s when it\u2019s the right formula for us", "now, you have many, many, many choices that are put in front of you", "and you have people to help", "but i would love to talk about choices in the morning", "so first thing in the morning has come up a number of times", "and i\u2019m rather obsessed with morning routines", "so you mentioned the incense, morocco", "you mentioned the tea, darjeeling", "when you wake up, do you eat breakfast right away", "what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like", "and what\u2019s the script", "what is the algorithm for you", "it\u2019s different all of the time", "okay", "is breakfast consistent", "for instance, for this week, what is your go-to breakfast", "so i\u2019m in training right now, and i\u2019m getting ready to play all of these hardcore tournaments", "and so for the last weeks, i\u2019ve been healing an injury", "now that that\u2019s all good, i\u2019m back into the routine of just intense training every day", "and so i start at a particular time in the morning", "i like to wake up early", "i like to go to bed early, so i wake up early", "i like to get about eight to nine hours of sleep", "sleep has been a big part of, i just feel like the makeup of how i feel, of the energy level that i have", "yeah", "i wake up at 6:30", "i usually have to be ready by 9 for practice", "so i use that time, and it kind of depends", "right now, i have a couple of businesses that i\u2019m a part of", "so a lot of the first hour, hour and a half, i spend maybe on a conference call because that\u2019s usually afternoon time in europe", "so i\u2019ll do one of those", "i\u2019ll answer a few emails that\u2019s coming in from europe", "i have a candy brand, so we have to make a lot of decisions on that on a daily basis", "sugarpova", "sugarpova, right", "is it true, and i\u2019m not going to interrupt beyond this, but is it true that you were considering legally changing your last name", "it was an idea", "for the 2013 us open", "it was an idea", "it\u2019s a genius idea, genius idea", "it proved to be very difficult", "so you\u2019re taking conference calls", "yeah", "so i do that work for the first hour or hour and a half with a cup of coffee that i have to have in the morning with lactose-free milk", "what type of lactose-free milk", "sorry, i\u2019m a nerd", "just straight-on lactose-free milk", "oh, i see", "so it\u2019s not almond milk or coconut milk", "no", "i see, lactose-free real milk", "and preferred coffee", "i do an espresso, simple", "and i think, for me, it\u2019s all about the foam", "so i have to have the right foam", "so i do that", "and then, usually, when i\u2019m getting ready, i turn on a podcast, and i listen", "it kind of depends on the mood i\u2019m in whether it\u2019s about health or i want to hear about someone\u2019s life or someone\u2019s experiences", "i\u2019ll turn that on so by the time i get my stuff ready for the whole day of practices and kind of brushing my teeth, i listen to other people share", "what are some of your favorite podcasts", "well, a good friend of mine is lewis howes, so i listen to his", "i listen to yours a bunch in the past six or eight months, i would say", "dan harris\u2019s", "i listen to a fashion one", "a little bit of everything", "so dan harris, this is dan harris of 10% happier", "yes", "all right", "why do you listen to dan harris", "because i was going to ask if you have a meditation practice of any type", "it\u2019s interesting", "someone asked me the other day, \u201cdo you meditate?\u201d and i said, \u201ci don\u2019t, but i really feel like i do because i listen to so many people speak about meditating that i really feel like i do.\u201d i had to think for a second", "i almost said yes", "and i was like, \u201cno, actually, i don\u2019t meditate, but i listen to people speak about it.\u201d and i have a little bit", "i\u2019ve done it, and i enjoy it", "some of it feels a little cultish to me", "sure, there\u2019s plenty of that floating around", "oh, yeah", "you didn\u2019t like the cat\u2019s paw and black roses i sent you", "is that what you\u2019re trying to tell me", "i like to hear about peoples\u2019 life-changing experience", "and i think that\u2019s what really interests me is how something can affect a person, whether it\u2019s reading a book, whether it\u2019s hearing a mantra, whether it\u2019s meditating", "so that\u2019s why i like listening to people speak about their practices or how it\u2019s influenced their life or what they were going through that required that", "yeah, i love learning from peoples\u2019 experiences", "so i think that\u2019s one of the reasons i listen to his", "i think you\u2019ve been meditating your entire life because of your comfort level with repetition", "right", "i think that is one in the same, in a lot of respects", "the one thing that i\u2019ve, and i don\u2019t really know where i got it from, but one thing that i do, i realize that our thoughts are so spread out and that they go in so many different directions", "and when i notice that my mind goes to places that are so unnecessary, when i create my own stories that are so far from the truth, i bring it back to the center of my breath", "so i do think about just breathing", "and that\u2019s not like me sitting in a chair and having thoughts or saying, \u201cnow i\u2019m going to meditate for 10 minutes.\u201d\u00a0that\u2019s just me, whether it\u2019s on a practice court, and things are not going well, or i\u2019m making so many errors", "and, all of a sudden, i just create the story that is so far from the truth or the reality", "what would be an example of that", "so say my coach has me \u2013 say i\u2019ve studied some video analysis, and he showed me a particular stroke that he wants me to work on or a particular movement", "and he says that\u2019s incorrect", "and he shows me an example of what he thinks i should do a little differently", "and so i go on the practice court", "i start doing that", "and with repetition, i\u2019m not getting the outcome that i wanted", "and so i plant the story that no, he\u2019s incorrect", "he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about", "or that no, actually, this doesn\u2019t feel right", "this doesn\u2019t feel natural", "if it doesn\u2019t feel natural now, it\u2019s not going to feel natural in a competitive state of mind", "and all of those things are completely not true", "those are all things that i\u2019m putting in my brain", "how do you catch that", "what do you say in your own head when you catch it", "i\u2019m so aware of my surroundings", "and i\u2019m really aware of kind of the inside choices that i make", "i\u2019ve had sort of this feeling from a young age where i know how my mind can affect others or my surrounding and myself included, without having to say one word", "so i try to bring it back to my breath or, sometimes, changing those words completely, even though those are also not true.\u00a0but they\u2019re much better than the negative outcome that you\u2019re putting out into the world", "i interrupted, at some point, which i\u2019m prone to doing because i get all excited", "i also want to recommend hardcore history with dan carlin, if you haven\u2019t heard it", "okay, i will tomorrow morning", "i recommend starting with wrath of the khans is what i would recommend starting with", "it is my favorite podcast of all time", "and he does one episode every six to 12 months", "but you will see why", "they are incredible", "and also, i would be remiss if i didn\u2019t say thank you to lewis, a mutual friend, who made the introduction", "that\u2019s right", "he made this possible", "a very good man", "yes", "i think we didn\u2019t get around to it because i got all hoppity and jumped in, but right now, you have the espresso with very important foam", "you have some conference calls", "you take care of sugarpova and soon", "then my phone goes in my bag for the next few hours, and i train", "when do you eat", "what do you have for breakfast", "i eat probably 30 minutes before i get to practice", "okay", "so for the first 2 1/2 or 3 hours, you\u2019re not having breakfast", "i have a liter of water and a cup of coffee", "is it special water", "no", "it\u2019s avian water", "got it", "it\u2019s not $27 southern california water", "no, no", "got it", "and so i drink that", "i drink my coffee", "and then, breakfast, i usually make myself a smoothie or a green juice with spinach and kale and chia seeds and coconut water and all of the greens, cucumber, kiwi", "and i always have a piece of rye bread", "that\u2019s kind of the european \u2013 i love rye bread, so i start with that", "and i either put some goat cheese on it or a piece of protein or avocado and some berries", "and that\u2019s it", "sounds delicious", "thanks", "pretty straightforward", "i love rye bread, but my tendency is to eat a whole loaf of rye bread if i allow myself a little bit", "i\u2019m not very good at that moderation thing", "well, the thing about rye bread is that i don\u2019t think that it\u2019s so good", "i think it\u2019s better than some other breads, but it\u2019s not like sourdough i love, but i don\u2019t eat regular bread that much", "so if i was eating a piece of sourdough, i\u2019d probably have three pieces", "but rye bread is kind of in between", "it\u2019s edible", "it\u2019s digestible and good, but it\u2019s not a snicker\u2019s bar", "exactly", "but you don\u2019t want too much of it", "that\u2019s a good point", "yeah", "no", "this is a smart approach", "so just a few more things", "in the last few years, or just in recent memory, what is a new belief or behavior or habit that has greatly improved your life", "does anything come to mind", "one thing that i had to go to in the past 15 months was being away from my sport because of a suspension that i faced", "and i went through this time period, obviously, with a lot of questions and questions of whether i would return to the sport that i played", "but during that same time, i also realized, and i had a chance to stop and really recognize how and what i\u2019ve really done in my life and in my career to inspire others and to \u2013 and i\u2019ve used the word inspire a lot because that\u2019s how i kind of see other people inspire my life", "but i had so many moments and instances where i would come across people that would start a conversation with me and tell me how i\u2019ve influenced their kids or how they\u2019ve seen me compete and that they admire my spirit so much and that they can\u2019t wait to see me back", "and i never had that realization before, which sounds crazy", "and but i never really understood, or i don\u2019t think i really understood, maybe it was selfishly, how much i impacted other people", "did you notice that because pr madness was stressful, and you saw that as a counterbalance", "or why do you think you noticed it", "i think i noticed it because so many more people had the courage to speak to me, which usually people would come up to you and ask for an autograph or ask for a picture", "and it would just be a few seconds of your time", "but these were instances where people would come and have a proper conversation with you about how they can\u2019t wait to see me back, and they can\u2019t wait to see me play and what i mean to them", "and it was just different", "it was a different communication", "it was a different way of \u2013 and every person helped me feel better, there\u2019s no doubt", "and there were chefs coming from the kitchen, and there were pilots coming from the cockpit", "and it was just an experience i don\u2019t think i would have ever felt", "and maybe because i never wanted to feel that huge responsibility that i did have this impact and that i always wanted to keep impacting and always be the right example", "maybe that\u2019s why i never quite \u2013 but i do think that, subconsciously, i didn\u2019t want to give in to that because maybe that would have added more pressure", "because, as i said before, my parents never made me feel that if i did or didn\u2019t make it, that it would be all right to go back to where we started", "it was a very eye-opening moment", "you had your first sponsor, as i understand it, when you were 11", "yeah, nike", "so when you were getting that amount of attention, and when you have adulation from fans and chefs and so on, it would seem to me a very human temptation and very easy to get a very big head and for that to affect your life and performance and so on", "how do you counteract that", "or how do you avoid that", "because that\u2019s been the downfall of many, many people who have been in the limelight for various things", "i will say that i\u2019m a fairly realistic person", "and i know i\u2019ve been through a lot", "and so i faced a lot of grief, i faced a lot of press, i faced a lot of success, i faced a lot of boardroom meetings", "i\u2019ve seen a lot", "i\u2019ve seen a lot in my years", "and, at the end of it is, it\u2019s all \u2013 a lot of it is superficial, and a lot of it almost seems not human, super human", "but behind everything, there\u2019s a very human person", "there\u2019s a very normal, there\u2019s a very much simple human being that i\u2019ve been fortunate to make good money for my career", "but those things are never things that make me the happiest, and i know that, and i realize that", "the values that you have in your life are much smaller than that, and they bring so many more rewards than money could ever bring you", "of course, it\u2019s helpful", "and knowing that \u2013 it puts a huge smile on my face that i can support my grandparents and that i can buy them a home and that i know they\u2019re going to be comfortable", "and they can have their garden and grow their cucumbers, and my cousins can have a proper education", "and that feeling is incredible", "but that\u2019s \u2013 and that\u2019s a feeling that, of course, money brings you", "but, like i said, the relationship that i\u2019ve had with my parents, they\u2019re also very strong people", "and they will tell me if something \u2013 if they see that something is going on or if my decisions are not correct", "and they\u2019re very real", "and i surround myself with real people", "i\u2019m a very honest person myself", "i think that\u2019s part of the russian character", "i say it like it is", "i\u2019m very straight-on about what i feel", "and that\u2019s, sometimes, gotten me into trouble just based on maybe i should keep a few opinions to myself", "but i like this idea of, tell me how you feel about things", "tell me straight up", "don\u2019t go around \u2013 maybe, this word maybe is brutal", "it\u2019s like neither here nor there", "so it\u2019s hard", "it\u2019s definitely hard because, from a young age, i could have made so many different decisions that could have gotten me to different places", "what is one of the worst decisions that you avoided making, or one of the best decisions that your parents helped you make", "at that age, it was a lot of decisions that my parents made", "but i think, from a business point of view, i\u2019ve been able to be associated with many great brands", "and there was a lot of opportunity, especially when i was young, to make what i like to call \u2018quick money\u2019", "it\u2019s like wire in the bank, you show up for a shoot, and you do it, and you smile, and you leave", "and there you are", "and that is not that it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s great that you have this company and this brand that has tracked you down and has seen you and has studied you and wants you to be a part of their brand", "but i\u2019ve always felt like the best decisions i\u2019ve made are based on real partnerships, real understanding of what a company, of what myself wants from each other and why we want to work together", "and i really believe that\u2019s one of the reasons i\u2019ve had these partnerships for such a long time", "one example was with nike", "it\u2019s so much more than just me wearing a swoosh on the court", "i go into a store, and i take pride in the fact that \u2013 actually, i was walking around the other day, and someone came up to me and said, \u201cwow, you look like you could be a nike billboard.\u201d and i didn\u2019t know if that was funny or not or if they were making fun at what i was wearing, and i looked at her, and i was like, \u201cyeah.\u201d and then, she said, \u201coh, you\u2019re maria sharapova, of course you are", "they pay you to wear that.\u201d and i said, \u201cno, actually, you have no idea how happy i am to wear this.\u201d you kind of grow a fondness of the people that you work with", "there\u2019s so much that goes into a campaign, a product", "and i love that stuff", "i love knowing \u2013 i went to the nike campuses after my harvard experience", "and i followed around \u2013 i went into meetings, and i was a little ghost in all of these meetings because i wanted to learn about product development", "that was at beaverton", "yeah", "nice", "so i went into these meetings, and i just i wanted to know why a product is dropped and why this material was used and why that material was being developed", "and there\u2019s just so much incredible technology", "i love fashion", "i love creativity", "so i got to learn a lot about that", "but you take great pride in the people that you work with and the decisions that i made that started with either friendship or partnership where you understand the company, and you know the people are the ones that have grown", "i mean, you\u2019re playing the long game, in a lot of ways", "and i think there are many people who feel like they know a lot about you", "so my last two questions are about things that people might not know about you", "and hopefully, there\u2019s a lot of that in this conversation already", "but the first one is, if you had to give a ted talk about something you are not known for, no tennis, for instance, what would you talk about", "what is the personal obsession that few people know about or something you\u2019re good at that few people know about that you would talk about or anything", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m good at", "and i don\u2019t know if i\u2019d necessarily do a ted talk on it", "but i have a huge passion for architecture", "and i think i\u2019ve always said that, if i wasn\u2019t a tennis player, i would love to be an architect", "i find it\u2019s like my happy place", "when i am able to drive around palm springs or drive around tuscany and see the differences in beams and windows, i love studying that", "and i spent a few years building a home myself", "and that process, if i had the time, which i don\u2019t have at the moment, i would just do for fun", "so yeah, that would be something that i\u2019m passionate about that not many people know", "what do you like about it", "and do you have any favorite types of architecture or architects, any books that have influenced you", "yeah", "absolutely, from neutra to frank gehry", "i love the indoor and outdoor feel, and i love when architects are able to bring nature into a home and make it feel like you\u2019re living outside, but you\u2019re kind of in this cocoon environment", "i don\u2019t know if that makes sense", "it makes perfect sense", "but i\u2019ve just always been fascinated by how someone can have an idea and draw some lines", "and two years later, you have structure, and you have placement, and you have a floor plan, and you have this maze", "and it actually started from a young age because, growing up in florida, i was invited for a few sleepovers", "and i would go to a sleepover at, at that time, it was like a rich person\u2019s home that had four or five bedrooms", "and i had never seen a home that had four or five bedrooms before", "and it\u2019s like, what are all of these rooms for", "why are there two dining rooms", "why isn\u2019t one enough", "and that\u2019s when i became fascinated with floor plans and how something connects to another thing and the usage of space and then details like colors and materials", "yeah", "it was just always really appealing", "what is your personal favorite color", "i love neutral colors, so i love grays and darks, no browns", "wow", "i don\u2019t want to say black because that\u2019s \u2013 a little girl asked me the other day, \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d because she wanted to draw something for me, and i was about to say black, and then, i was like, oh no, she\u2019s not going to like me if i say black", "so now, anytime someone asks me my favorite color, i\u2019m like, yellow", "it sounds so much happier than black", "yeah", "i guess it\u2019s hard to say to a little girl who wants to draw you something, black like the grim reaper\u2019s cape", "exactly", "so i ended up with yellow", "that\u2019s your cover story", "so very last one, and we\u2019ll see what we get is what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love", "and i\u2019ll give you an example", "an example of this", "and i asked cheryl strayed this question who wrote wild, which was made into a movie", "an amazing woman", "and she said, \u201cevery sandwich i get has to be in uniform layers so every bite is as similar to the next as possible.\u201d so if she gets a sandwich, and all of the avocados are kind of over on one side or whatever, she\u2019ll reopen it and rearrange it so that every bite is the same", "so i\u2019m not saying that you have to have something like that", "but does anything come to mind, an unusual habit, a weird object, an absurd thing, anything that you love that is a little odd", "there are a few random things", "i always put my left shoe on before my right", "and not just a tennis shoe but any shoe", "when i\u2019m in a shoe, and i\u2019m trying shoes, and they hand me a right shoe, and i\u2019m like, i\u2019m sorry, i\u2019m fine with opening the box again myself", "but i\u2019d rather get the left shoe", "they give you a strange look", "then, for my match court outfits, i don\u2019t like to wear \u2013 usually, people like to wear the same outfit, so if they did well in it, they\u2019d wear it again", "i mean, they wash it but then wear it again", "or maybe they don\u2019t wash it", "i don\u2019t know", "so i do the opposite", "i don\u2019t wear it again", "i alternate", "so now, does that mean \u2013 i don\u2019t want to wear the same exact one", "i\u2019ll wear the same looking outfit, but i have a few different ones", "got it", "okay", "but never the exact same outfit again", "no", "i love it", "not in that same tournament", "when you win a huge \u2013 i feel like i\u2019m making a liar of myself, but when you win a big tournament, do you have a favorite cheat food or anything that you celebrate with", "i love sweets", "i love dulce de leche", "oh, my god", "i love we have this cake in russia, it\u2019s called the medovik", "it\u2019s a honey cake", "i could eat that every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner", "is it like baklava, or is it different", "no", "it\u2019s not as crunchy", "it\u2019s a soft cake", "it\u2019s a layer cake, but it\u2019s a soft cake", "i love cherry \u2013 when my grandmother makes cherry jam, i could eat that by the spoons", "that\u2019s a good childhood memory", "yeah", "so i love sweets", "well, it makes sense for sugarpova", "for an athlete, right", "it makes a lot of sense", "well, it\u2019s great for glycogen replenishment", "so for those people wondering, dulce de leche, also known as the crack cocaine of argentina, delicious on vanilla ice cream", "and if it\u2019s going to keep other people up until 4 in the morning because it will drive them nuts, rdls, romanian deadlifts, right", "yes", "just so that it doesn\u2019t bother anybody", "maria, this has been so much fun", "thank you", "i really appreciate you taking the time", "oh no, thank you so much", "and i really encourage people to learn more about your story", "i cannot wait to read unstoppable", "and people can find you at mariasharapova.com, facebook.com/sharapova, and then, twitter and instagram are both @mariasharapova", "do you have any final ask of the people listening or a suggestion for the audience, anything that comes to mind", "no", "i just hope that they continue listening to your work because, when i started, i was so impressed by your interviews and the way you\u2019re able to get a lot out of people in a conversational form", "and so keep listening", "and i\u2019m so really excited about the opportunity that i have to share my
