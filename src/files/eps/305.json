My guest today is Daniel H. Pink, @danielpink on Twitter. He\u2019s the author of six provocative books, including his newest When subtitle The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing. When is a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post, and Publisher\u2019s Weekly bestseller. That\u2019s a lot of lists. Pink\u2019s other books include the long-running New York Times bestseller A Whole New Mind, and the No. 1 New York Times bestsellers, Drive and To Sell is Human. His books have won multiple awards, and have been translated into 37 languages at last count. He lives in Washington DC with his family. You can also find his work, his various goings-on at danpink.com, and, if Facebook is your thing, facebook.com/danielhpink. Dan, welcome to the show. Daniel Pink: Tim, thanks for having me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s been quite a while since we last \u2013 Daniel Pink: Several years. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Several years. And I know we were talking about all things Japanese most likely, at least, in one of our recent conversations based on one of your books. And maybe you could tell people, actually, just this context, a little bit about that book that we were chatting about in manga format, or Japanese comic format, and we\u2019ll use that a jumping off point. Daniel Pink: Yes, indeed. That was one of my best ideas that didn\u2019t go anywhere. So, that was a book called The Adventures of Johnny Bunko, and as you say, Tim, it was written in the Japanese comic format known as manga. And, as you know, as a Japanophile, in Japan, manga, the comic format, is much more versatile and more widely used that it is here in the United States. So, you have grown-ups reading comics, and they can be things about financial advice, things about love life, things about history. And so I did a fellowship in Japan with my wife our three kids, where I studied the Manga industry, and I came back and said, \u201cYou know what? I think it\u2019s time for Manga to broaden its reach here in the United States of America.\u201d So, I wrote a book called The Adventures of Johnny Bunko, and it\u2019s a graphic novel in manga form that reveals the six essential lessons of any satisfying productive career, through the story of a hapless young accountant named Johnny Bunko. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s a fantastically concise description. And I wanted to also \u2013 you said, in the beginning, that it was the best idea that didn\u2019t go anywhere or something along those lines. And I wanted to bring up the book, because it seems, for those people it struck a cord with, it struck a very deep cord, and I believe it as Kevin Kelly \u2013 arguably the most interesting man in the world \u2013 who was on this podcast, and he mentioned that that book was \u2013 at least at the time \u2013 his most gifted book. So I wanted to, at least, highlight the fact that if it\u2019s good enough for Kevin Kelly, it should be good enough for many, many other people. Daniel Pink: That\u2019s exactly right. Kevin did say that, and I actually think it\u2019s a good book; we did reasonably well with, but it didn\u2019t blow off the doors. I think I was \u2013 and this is a common thing that happens in life, and investing, in entrepreneurship, in publishing, in anything, it\u2019s that you could be ripe too early. I think that\u2019s what it was, that I actually think that this format of graphic novels and comics having a more expansive reach in the United States, is probably going to happen. I might have been, as they would say in the world of politics \u2013 I might have been a little ahead of the voters. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Or using a surfing metaphor, paddling a little too early for the wave, which sometimes means you don\u2019t catch a wave. In investing, it sometimes means you paddle right into the impact zone and then get smashed. Then you mentioned politics. I wasn\u2019t going to go here right away, but \u2013 and I\u2019m going to get there in two hops \u2013 but I\u2019m looking at, in front of me, the Yale Law & Policy Review Volume 8, No. 2990, and it says at the top \u2013 Daniel Pink: This is like a deposition now, what do you \u2013 you have like Exhibit A? Am I going to \u2013 did I say something 30 years ago that you\u2019re making me pay for right now? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m auditioning \u2013 indirectly albeit \u2013 for my role on True TV as Talent. But this won\u2019t go into any incriminatory territory unless you volunteer something along those lines, which I doubt will happen. But it says on top, \u201cEditor-in-Chief, Daniel H. Pink\u201d. So, how did fate intervene that you are not currently in the legal profession? Daniel Pink: Oh, my god. This is one area where I want to thank fate for grace and kindness. Here\u2019s the thing: I want to law school, and I went to law school largely because I was a middle-class kid from the middle of America, and that\u2019s kind of what you did. And once I, sort of, saw the inside \u2013 and it was a terrible decision, and it actually helped me figure out how to make better decisions. It gave me some, actually, really good advice on how to make better decisions. But I, basically, went law school without knowing what lawyers did, or even what law school was. It was just something I did because that\u2019s what I was supposed to do; I found I didn\u2019t really like it very much. And once I found out what lawyers actually did \u2013 and God bless the lawyers listening to this \u2013 but once I found what lawyers actually did, I was like, \u201cOh, you hire somebody else to do to that.\u201d It\u2019s like \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s like it takes skill to plunge a toilet, or that kind of thing, or mow a gigantic backyard \u2013 I mean, it takes skill to do that. It just that, you know what? It\u2019s really not my thing. And so, so what I\u2019d rather do is do something else and then pay someone else to do that kind of dirty work. And yet, I found myself stuck in because I was risk-averse \u2013 I did leave for a little while. Actually, I dropped out for a little while, but I came back. And so I went through law \u2013 I went through law school, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 accumulated massive, massive, massive, massive student loans. But I was very fortunate in two dimensions in my law school trajectory. One was that my school had a very ahead-of-its-time loan payback program, Key to Salary. So, if you made less than a certain amount, they would offer assistance in repaying your student loans. And that gave people much more \u2013 nobody \u2013 not many people took it \u2013 but that gave you, theoretically, more career flexibility if you decided not to practice law. The other thing is that I met my wife in law school. So, it\u2019s a decision that ended up having a profound positive effect on my life. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did it help you learn to make better decisions? Daniel Pink: Going to law school? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right. You said that \u2013 Daniel Pink: Well, here\u2019s the thing \u2013 okay, here\u2019s what it is. Here\u2019s the thing. So, there\u2019s this principle in social science, it has a fancy name, but it is something that we all do \u2013 and something that we should do \u2013 it\u2019s the Principle of Surrogation. Okay? How do you make decisions? You use the Principle of Surrogation. And surrogation basically means, find someone like you who made this decision, and see what happened to him or her. That is, find out what it\u2019s really like. Again, this is a totally fancified way of something that is very commonsensical. Should I go to this restaurant? Well, let me check the Yelp reviews of 47 other people who have gone to this restaurant. And what I did \u2013 and it\u2019s amazing to me, Tim, when I think about this, and it\u2019s advice that I give to my own kids as well. I went to law school literally having never spent a day \u2013 not a day, ten minutes \u2013 talking to a lawyer about what he does. I\u2019m not \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m embarrassed to say that, but that\u2019s absolutely the case. I went to law school having never sat in on a law school class. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable to me in retrospect. And so, had I done those kinds of things, I might have approached it more skeptically. But I didn\u2019t do those things, and so \u2013 and because that ended up being an incredibly expensive decision \u2013 even though it led to some \u2013 it basically \u2013 I mean, it led to the most positive thing in my life which is my wife \u2013 even though it led to something positive, it was a terrible decision. So, now, I\u2019m sort of a surrogation \u2013 a surrogation idealogue, like I believe in surrogation for everything. Largely because I got bitten by that bad decision. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Can you give us an example of at some fork in the road or some perspective decision where you\u2019ve used surrogation \u2013 or where you\u2019re planning on using it? Daniel Pink: Oh, sure. Okay. So, I\u2019ll give you an example of it. So, again, we\u2019re not talking rocket science here, we\u2019re talking like, basically, \u201cHey, act like a reasonably intelligent grown-up,\u201d is basically what I\u2019m doing here. But let\u2019s go back to the \u2013 let\u2019s go back to the Japan thing. So, I got a fellowship to go to Japan, and I went with my wife and our kids as I mentioned. But before I did that, I talked to six different people who had the same fellowship \u2013 before I accepted \u2013 six different people who have the same fellowship, what it was like for their kids, what the work was like, what the living was like, before I made the decision. Now, again, that is not a monumental, intellectual breakthrough. But it\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t do when I was much younger. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, it\u2019s best practice that can often get skipped, right? Whether that\u2019s something like this or something that should be very straightforward, if you look at, say, [inaudible] [00:10:11] day\u2019s work and the checklist manifesto, and checking the various things to avoid bacterial line infections in a hospital, right? It\u2019s very straightforward, but if you neglect it, over time, bad things are going to happen. Daniel Pink: Yeah, yeah. But it\u2019s also the \u2013 I think that as \u2013 as I\u2019ve gotten older, and gotten more experience, I\u2019ve actually become much more aware of the importance of intellectual humility. And when I think of when I was younger, I feel, \u201cWell, I know what law school was like.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cWell, I just know. Because I thought about it, so I know. I know what lawyers do, because I met somebody who was a lawyer, and I know what lawyers \u2013\u201d And so there\u2019s a degree of arrogance in that; I was thinking that you know something when you actually don\u2019t. And so,\u00a0 if you approach all kinds of decisions with a degree of intellectual humility and ask yourself, \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know about this? Where are my blind spots?\u201d, then I think you\u2019ll end up making better decisions. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Definitely. Speaking of blind spots, I promised I would segue into politics, and that is somewhere I have very, very little confidence in any of my knowledge or expertise. How did you \u2013 so I was looking at what I believe to be one of your first articles that really \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say \u201cput you on the map\u201d, that\u2019s too much of an overstatement \u2013 but the Free Agent Nation article on Fast Company which was at the end of 199 \u2013 . Daniel Pink: Yeah. 20 years ago. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, 1997. And in the bio \u2013 or the byline, rather \u2013 of that article says, \u201cUntil recently, chief speechwriter to Vice President Al Gore. So, where did you go from law school \u2013 or dropping out of law school, for a period of time \u2013 to speechwriting for then-Vice President Al Gore? Daniel Pink: Well, when I graduated from law school, I was, actually, very keenly interested in politics; it was probably my deepest interest at the time. And I said, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to go work \u2013 I\u2019m going to work in politics.\u201d And \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why was it interesting to you at the time? Daniel Pink: A couple of reasons. No. 1 is that I thought it was a venue for achieving something in the world and making a contribution to the world. The other thing is that I found the actual practice of it quite exciting and interesting in the way that sport is exciting and interesting. So, it\u2019s was combo platter for me. And I had been interested in it for many, many years. And I said, \u201cOkay, this is what I want to do.\u201d So, I got out of law school, and I started working on political campaigns \u2013 which, at the time, I liked, because political campaigns are totally interesting. I mean, again, it\u2019s like a sport, in that there\u2019s a beginning and there\u2019s an end, and there is a very clear outcome. And it\u2019s exciting, and you\u2019re making decisions on the fly, and I find political campaigns, more than other kinds of organizations and institutions, fairly meritocratic because there\u2019s so much going on, and so much crazy stuff happening that, if you can do something, you will continue to \u2013 you\u2019ll be asked to do it again. And that\u2019s pretty much what happened to me. And that, someone, at some point asked me to write a speech, and I did it, and it was okay. And then they said, \u201cHey, that\u2019s okay. You want to do it again?\u201d And I did it again. And then I did a third time. And then, all of a sudden, that was my job. And it ended up being something that I had a certain affinity for, and it\u2019s something that a lot of other people did not, and so just in the supply and demand of who had to do what, that\u2019s what I ended up doing, and I enjoyed it. I did it political campaigns, I did for a cabinet secretary, and then I ended up doing it for the \u2013 I ended up doing for the Vice President. The trouble was is that, when I had spent all these years in the belly of the beast, it\u2019s sort of like, \u201cWow, I really want to work in politics,\u201d and all of a sudden, in a pretty kind of half-assed way, I was at a pretty good gig in the belly of the beast. I realized, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not sure this is my thing. I thought this was my thing, but I\u2019m discovering that this is not my thing, and what\u2019s even worse is that if I project out even further, and look at, say, what I\u2019m going to be like, or what I\u2019m going to be doing in ten years or 20 years, I really don\u2019t like that picture, because I see some of those people around me.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0But is there anything besides the projecting forward, looking at the people who had \u2013 been in the game, so to speak, for a longer period of time, and saying, \u201cWow, I could see myself filling their shoes, and I don\u2019t like what that looks like,\u201d was there anything else, any other indicators or moments that made you realize it wasn\u2019t for you? Daniel Pink: There were a few things. First of all, the amount of BS that was involved was startling to me. I expected some, but if you do a pie chart of BS and not-BS, the BS slice was extraordinarily large \u2013 larger than you would imagine on a number of different dimensions. And here\u2019s the thing, Tim, I freaking lucked out too, in who I was working for, because my last two jobs, I worked for Al Gore who\u2019s a very smart guy, and a very good guy, all around. And before that, I worked for the then labor secretary, I was a speechwriter the then labor secretary, a guy named Robert Reich, who\u2019s a very smart guy, and a good guy. So, I had basically the best kind of bosses you could possibly have. And so, that was another indicator \u2013 so I got the best bosses you could possibly have, and I still like, \u201cHmm, it\u2019s not the species of the Reich or Gore, I don\u2019t like, it\u2019s the genies of politics that is actually bringing me down.\u201d And so \u2013 and so among the things that I didn\u2019t like \u2013 let\u2019s go back to the BS. There was an enormous amount of \u2013 an enormous amount of time spent, basically in the air, in almost everything that was going on \u2013 within the boundaries of the law, obviously \u2013 concern for basically pandering and fundraising. It was really quite remarkable. The other thing is that I also felt like a lot of the other people who were good people, that they were so interested in \u2013 they were so absorbed in the mechanics of things, that they \u2013 I felt like I was losing sight over, like, what we were doing here in the first place, what did we actually \u2013 what did actually believe in that the \u2013 and there was so much short-termism, so much short-term insane kind of posturing, and, \u201cOh, let\u2019s get this slight advantage over the day.\u201d And it was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? What\u2019s the point of all this?\u00a0 I\u2019m working really, really hard, and I\u2019m not sure this is \u2013 I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re actually doing that much. And here\u2019s the scary part, it\u2019s like \u2013 that was 20 years ago. In retrospect, those are the good old days. I mean, you have \u2013 I mean, we were \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m old enough, I did this long enough ago, where I\u2019d be pumped when something I wrote made it onto the \u201cevening news\u201d. I haven\u2019t watched the evening news for 19 years. We weren\u2019t dealing with social media, the world was very, very, very partisan then, but nothing like the way it is now. So, I remember devoting a couple of days in my office to some subpoena that was given to Gore\u2019s office, or filing some document about some nonsense thing \u2013 and I\u2019m really concerned about that because I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my god, if I have an email that mentions X, Y, or Z, and I don\u2019t find it, and then someone else finds it, then I\u2019m going to have\u00a0 to hire a lawyer and \u2013 I didn\u2019t sign up for this garbage.\u201d So \u2013 so, I finally decided to \u2013 yeah, so, again, this thing that I thought I was deeply, deeply interested in, once I actually experienced it, I found myself far less interested in it than I would have suspected. If you had told me that \u2013 when I left that job \u2013 if you had told me ten years earlier; \u201cYou\u2019re going to have this job, and you\u2019re going to leave it because you\u2019re tired of politics,\u201d I would have been very surprised. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If you look back at that experience, the skills you either had natively or developed, how do you prepare your speeches now? Or maybe if we take an example, of a speech that you\u2019ve given, that has received very positive feedback, or really \u2013 from your perspective \u2013 engaged the audience, how do you prepare \u2013 how do go about preparing a 30-minute, 60-minute speech? What does that look like? Is there any example that you can give us? Daniel Pink: Yeah. I mean it depends. I mean, actually, that experience writing speeches was actually extraordinarily useful in going out and being a writer, and then going out and talking about what I\u2019ve written about. I mean, it\u2019s extraordinarily useful. I mean, if for no other reason, Tim, it was \u2013 I mean, I spent a lot of time as a speechwriter, watching audiences react, seeing what worked and what didn\u2019t. And that, I think, has completely left an imprint on me. Again, I was able \u2013 I had this before I went out on doing it myself, I spent as much time as any human being could have done watching speeches being given, but I always would watch \u2013 when any of my bosses would give a speech, I would actually watch the audience rather than my boss to see \u2013 because that\u2019s how I learned to get better at it. \u201cHey that line works. Hey, that line\u2019s a dud. Hey, they\u2019re spacing out here. Hey, this person over here looks confused. Wow, this went on too long. Wow, this could have gone a little \u2013\u201d I never had experienced it, it could have gone on longer. But this could have \u2013 seriously, we could have cut it out there. And so, seeing audiences react just give me \u2013 I mean it\u2019s hard to \u2013 let me think of an analogy here \u2013 okay, listen, imperfect analogy, but it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m going to go, basically walk up and down the streets of Santiago, Chile for a couple of years. I\u2019m not going to do any talking, but I\u2019m going to listen to everybody else talking. And it\u2019s like, \u201cWow, you\u2019re going to learn some Spanish that way.\u201d It\u2019s not going to be \u2013 you\u2019re not going to be perfectly Spanish, but you have a huge advantage of someone if you do that, and then go and say, \u201cHey, I think I\u2019m going to learn how to speak Spanish.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And then it also makes me think of a very useful feature for a potential speaker, although it\u2019s probably not worth the labor for the TED Organization, would be to take the camera see that\u2019s always pointed at the audience and give you the option of listening to Ted talks while watching the audience respond. Daniel Pink: That\u2019s an interesting idea; that\u2019s an interesting idea. I mean, they do cutaways on those kinds of things, but the cutaways don\u2019t show people being bored. That\u2019s actually more revealing than anything else. And I\u2019ll tell you, from a speech-giver\u2019s point of view \u2013 and it\u2019s interesting you raise this, Tim, because I haven\u2019t really thought a huge amount about it myself. But one of the things that I enjoy most about giving talks is seeing the audience\u2019s reaction, and figuring out what\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t. So, if I come up with, \u201cHey, I got this killer line I just thought of; this is going to totally rule.\u201d And then I deliver it, and it\u2019s like, \u201cWoah, that bombed.\u201d And in my head, I don\u2019t feel like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sad that it bombed.\u201d But in the back of my head, I\u2019m like, \u201cAh, that bombed, that\u2019s so interesting. I got to make a note of that, like that one bombed.\u201d Daniel Pink: And why did that one bomb? Did people not understand it? Was it obnoxious? And so, I loved that part of \u2013 and when you give speeches, and you do something in real time with people \u2013 really, anything before an audience. So, if you and I were talking before a live audience, we would be getting feedback on a conversation that I think would be really useful and interesting. And when you do things that are asynchronous, as we\u2019re doing now, or writing a book which is asynchronous, you get that feedback much later, and so the feedback is as meaningful. And so, if I \u2013 if I write something, and someone says, \u201cYou wrote this passage here, I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d That\u2019s sort of a bummer for me, because I don\u2019t time to [inaudible] [00:22:49] it. But if I say something before an audience, and I get a bunch of blank looks, I immediately know, \u201cWow, okay, I didn\u2019t explain that very well. I got to back, next time around, and explain it better.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019ve so many different questions I want to dig into related to what you just said. First is, actually, connected to something we were talking about, just before we hit record. And that was you, having listened to the interview I did with Bryan Koppelman, the screenwriter, filmmaker, co-creator of the hit show Billions among many other things.\u00a0 And his penchant to end recommendation for forensically studying film \u2013 watching films with a notebook in hand, and taking notes on what worked, what didn\u2019t, his responses and so on. And you mentioned a number of different questions and cues that you might were yourself while watching, in your speechwriter days, the audience while your \u2013 [inaudible] [00:23:52] your boss is giving a talk.\u00a0 Would you be writing those things down? Would you be sitting there with a notebook in hand, recording this type of thing? Daniel Pink: What I would be \u2013 what I would often be doing would be \u2013 I would have \u2013 so, if I had \u2013 if it was a speech where there was a written text \u2013 which is not always the case. In some cases, for lower-key \u2013 for less significant things, it would be, say, conversations and talking points, and some things like that. But let\u2019s say for a speech that was actually delivered, that is a speech that was written out, and then delivered behind a podium, I would always have the actual physical text of the speech, and I would markup that physical text of it. So, in some cases, because it was helpful for me in terms of just relating to my own boss \u2013 let\u2019s say that he skipped a paragraph, I\u2019m like, \u201cHmm, I wonder why he skipped that paragraph,\u201d maybe ask him about that, or maybe I could even figure out why he skipped that paragraph \u2013 he didn\u2019t even bother reading the paragraph, or he skipped a line, or he ad-libbed a new version of the line. That was, actually, very helpful for me in terms of just dealing with my boss. Because, again, what you\u2019re trying to do in writing a speech for somebody else, it that you\u2019re trying to make that person sound like the best version of him or herself. And so, it could be that the way I phrase something didn\u2019t sound like him, but he knew what I meant, and he was able to phrase it in his own words, and that, actually, was helpful for me in terms of doing the tactical craft of my job. So, I would have the text with me, I would say there was a joke, I would say \u2013 I mean, I basically would \u2013\u00a0 I mean like plus and minus, and say, \u201cHey, that joke worked, that joke didn\u2019t work. That line worked, that line didn\u2019t work.\u201d And one of the things that it taught me was, also, is that you don\u2019t go based on \u2013 and I\u2019m getting in the weeds here a little bit \u2013 but you don\u2019t make permanent decisions based on one reaction. And I do that, myself, now in my own stuff. So, if I say something and it doesn\u2019t work the first time, I don\u2019t abandon the thing; I make a note of that, and then I try it again. Because, sometimes, different audiences, different contexts, different things, it can work. But yeah, I would do that. And here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t want to make this sound like \u2013 I use the word \u201cforensic\u201d to talk about what Koppelman is doing. Mine was less forensic, it was more hygienic. To me, it\u2019s like \u2013 that\u2019s just good staff hygiene. You know what I mean? I wrote a speech, and this dude is delivering it, I should pay attention to how it\u2019s going.\u00a0 And if I do that \u2013 if I do that, I\u2019m going to do better next time, and he\u2019s going to do better next time. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If I look at the \u2013 my own writing, the writing that I\u2019ve done that has received the best response \u2013 just keep it broad \u2013 nine times out of ten, it\u2019s something that I have tested and honed in some speaking format, whether it\u2019s a presentation or a class, or something else. Which is part of the reason why, if I\u2019m giving a talk or doing an interview in front of a lot of audience, I always ask them to raise the house lights, because for whatever reason, a lot of venues like to really dim it down, but then you can\u2019t see the response. So, I always ask to raise the house lights. Daniel Pink: Totally. Totally with you on that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0When you are testing out a speech, or an article, or a chapter on someone else, what types of questions \u2013 what are you looking for, or what types of questions do you ask? You can pick any of those that you\u2019d like \u2013 but what types of questions do you ask?\u00a0Okay. Yeah, yeah. Let me take your simple question and complicate it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Let\u2019s go for it. Daniel Pink: Because I actually think that speeches and written word are different things. And so \u2013 so the way that I would convey an idea in a speech is going to be different from the way that I would convey this similar, same idea in a book. And so, for me, like one of the most important \u2013 I have to say, it\u2019s a simple question, but \u2013 and I find myself asking it all the time to people is this following question, \u201cDoes that make sense? Does that make sense?\u201d Or what I\u2019ve sometimes found, an easier way to rephrase that, is \u2013 this is actually \u2013 I think it\u2019s actually a useful writing hack is \u2013 \u201cWhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Daniel Pink: So, I think that people are more likely to say, \u201cDoes that make sense?\u201d, out of politeness, and also just out of self, \u201cOh, of course, that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d But, sort of, \u201cWhat about that \u2013\u201d so, I converted a little bit, \u201cWhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d When you explain an idea to somebody, or you\u2019re talking to an audience, I really think \u2013 I mean, maybe I\u2019m overestimating my own abilities \u2013 but I really think you can tell by the looks on people\u2019s faces. There are all other kinds of markers of that too. So, for instance \u2013 especially now, if you have slides, what are people taking pictures of? What slides are they taking pictures of? What things are they writing down? So, I look at those kinds of cues in talks. I think writing is more difficult, and I\u2019ll tell you what I do in writing, especially books, and this is a little bit insane \u2013 or it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s insane in the sense that it requires someone who is deeply devoted to you in a way that someone you truly love is devoted to you. So, here\u2019s the thing about my books: I \u2013 even though I\u2019m \u2013 even though I just said speeches and written words are different, for me, I actually improve my writing by listening to it. Not because \u2013 I listen to written words different from the way I listen to speeches, if that makes any sense. And so, when I write books \u2013 so the latest book \u2013 I mean the latest book and all the previous books \u2013 I have an office here behind my house in Washington DC, it\u2019s a garage \u2013 refurbished garage. And for \u2013 I would sit in my office \u2013 and let\u2019s talk about the latest book, just to give you idea. So, this is a book, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like 280 pages, something like that. I read every word of that book out loud to my wife, at various stages. What\u2019s more, I read drafts \u2013 multiple drafts of chapters \u2013 out loud to my wife in this office. But wait, there\u2019s more. My wife read every word of this book out loud to me, including drafts. Because, for me, that\u2019s how I \u2013 that\u2019s how I process the written word. So, for me, I can tell what works in a speech, because you have a large audience of people behind \u2013 reacting to it. When, in terms of written words, like I \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just like \u2013 you know, after all these years, I know what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not when it comes to the written word. And I actually know what\u2019s not good, really, is what I know. And so, I try to remove all the not-good stuff. And the way I do that, and it\u2019s a very laborious way, is to read aloud because that helps me look at the words a different way, but also to have them read aloud to me. Now, what\u2019s amazing to this \u2013 and shows you just how incredible and awesome my wife is \u2013 is that I\u2019m the worst person on the planet to be read aloud to, because I\u2019m a complete pain in the ass when it comes to \u2013 especially if you\u2019re reading my works. \u201cOh, come on, you\u2019ve got read with more expression than that.\u201d \u201cOh, come on. No, the emphasis is on that word. No.\u201d And my saintly wife has done this for several books now. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Wow, she\u2019s a keeper. I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve only \u2013 I suspect this is more common than either of us might expect, but John McPhee,\u00a0 the non-fiction writer, also writes \u2013 I think h still writes for the New Yorker. Fascinating guy, but I took a seminar with him in undergrad, and he also explained how he reads all of his work. I believe he reads not only his feature works but his articles out loud to his wife. Daniel Pink: Really? I actually did not know that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. So, this is \u2013 yeah. Daniel Pink: Well, I\u2019m pretty good company, because I \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You\u2019re in good company. Daniel Pink: I started reading John McPhee when I was like a \u2013 like a pretty \u2013 like a young teenager. And one of the best McPhee books I\u2019ve read was a book \u2013 you might have read it \u2013 called Levels of the Game Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You know, it\u2019s so good. It\u2019s so, so good. Daniel Pink: I loved that book. I read it again \u2013 I actually read it again about two years ago. But I read it as a kid; I got it out the library, I spent a lot time in libraries when I was a kid, and I don\u2019t know how, some librarian or somebody told me about it. Because there was a \u2013 because he has that famous book about Bill Bradley A Sense of Where You Are, so I read that because I was a basketball fan. And it\u2019s like \u2013 I was also a tennis fan, and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you read about tennis too?\u201d And I read that book, and I didn\u2019t \u2013 at the time, I guess I was saying, \u201cWow, you can actually write about sports in a way that\u2019s, kind of, more interesting than just sports.\u201d That\u2019s a remarkable book \u2013 I mean, I can explain it. So, it\u2019s a story about a match between \u2013 a single tennis match between Arthur Ashe \u2013 who, then, was very young, just out of Richmond \u2013 and a guy named Clark Graebner who was from a wealthier \u2013 white guy, wealthier family in \u2013 I think it was suburban Cleveland. And what he does is he basically describes the match, but throughout he pulls back and tells each of their stories of how they actually got to the court that day; I think it was a US Open \u2013 a US Open match. And so, he actually describes them playing a point, and then he pulls back and talks about how Arthur Ashe got there, and he pulls back and talks about Clark Graebner go there. And he does it with such elegance and such precision, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a joy to behold. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s truly spectacular. For those who haven\u2019t read McPhee, you should \u2013 if not for any other reason, that he can take any subject matter you can imagine, and make a riveting book about said subject \u2013 it could be oranges, Plymouth rocks, cars, hand-carved canoes, geology. Daniel Pink: Yeah. Oranges book, I read that when I was a kid too. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It just \u2013 you name the topic, and he can turn it into a page-turner. But Levels of the Game is just spectacular. And one thing that McPhee is a very, very good at is \u2013 and I think this is also shared territory with you \u2013 is asking questions. Given the nature of his writing, a very significant portion of his time is spent interviewing. And, \u201cWhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d is a really powerful tweak on the, maybe, alternative that you mentioned, which is, \u201cDoes this make sense?\u201d or \u201cDoes this make sense or not?\u201d And this may be digging too far into the weeds, but I was really fascinated to read about an approach that you\u2019ve detailed in one of your books called motivational interviewing. And I hadn\u2019t heard of this before, but the example that stuck out to me \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to give this exact example \u2013 was asking a student who is, seemingly struggling with algebra, a certain question instead of others. I don\u2019t want to butcher it, but I can certainly, also \u2013 I have in front of me, so I can pull it up if need be. But can you explain for people what motivational interviewing is, and maybe give an example? Daniel Pink: Yeah. So, this is actually a \u2013 it\u2019s a therapeutic technique that, I think, has a wider application. And I\u2019ve heard about it from a fellow named Mike Pantalon, who\u2019s at Yale School of Medicine who used it in, I think, addiction treatment. And it\u2019s basically like this: so, let\u2019s say that \u2013 let\u2019s say that you have \u2013 let me think of a good example here, of something that somebody, typically, isn\u2019t that keen to do. Okay, let\u2019s go to algebra, let\u2019s say you have \u2013 let\u2019s say you\u2019re a parent and you have kid who\u2019s in eighth grade, and he is \u2013 has an algebra test and doesn\u2019t want to study for that algebra test \u2013 isn\u2019t into it, doesn\u2019t want to do it. And so, a typical reaction from parents, from anybody in authority figure is, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong \u2013?\u201d, start saying \u2013 just sort of demanding, start demanding compliance. And motivational interviewing is almost the reverse of that. So, it basically \u2013 so, let\u2019s say you have a kid named Bob. You could say \u201cHey, Bob, I see you\u2019re not studying for your algebra test. Let me ask you a question \u2013 I see you have an algebra test tomorrow, on a scale of 1 to 10, how ready are you to study for your algebra test? How are ready are you to start studying for your algebra test? How much do you want to start studying for your algebra test?\u201d And bob is totally unmotivated by it; Bob might say, \u201cI\u2019m a 3, a 3 out of 10.\u201d Now, again, our reaction as bosses, as parents, as people, and figures of authority is to say, \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re a 3? You should be a 9.\u201d But instead, you\u2019re more chilled than that, and you say, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re a 3. Why didn\u2019t you pick a lower number?\u201d And that always wakes people up. So, he says, \u201cI\u2019m a\u00a0 3 out of 10 in terms of my desire to do this thing.\u201d And you say \u2013 instead of saying, \u201cMy god, you should be a 9. What, are you crazy? You lazy ass.\u201d, you say, \u201cOh, why didn\u2019t you pick a lower numb And what\u2019s interesting about that, is that \u2013 it\u2019s what it does to Bob. It\u2019s that Bob has to now say why he\u2019s not a\u00a0 2. And so, he begins saying things like, \u201cWell, you know, if I don\u2019t study for this test, I\u2019m probably going to bomb the next test; if I don\u2019t master this material, it\u2019s going to be harder to go into later on. If I don\u2019t do well in this test, you might hassle me.\u201d And so what happens is, is that Bob begins articulating his own autonomous, intrinsically motivated reasons for doing something. And that\u2019s the key. A And what we know \u2013 from a mountain of social sciences \u2013 is that when people have their own reasons for doing something, they\u2019re more likely to endorse the behavior, and they\u2019re more likely to carry it out. And so, this becomes a way to surface Bob\u2019s own motivation for it through questions, rather than through \u2013 rather than through dictates. And it can be a very, very powerful technique; you can also turn it inward. You say, \u201cWell, how ready are you, Dan, to finish this chapter? \u201cOh god, I\u2019m like a 3.\u201d And you say, \u201cWell, Dan, why aren\u2019t you a 2?\u201d And so, anything you can do to help people surface their own reasons for doing something makes them more likely to commit to behavior, and more likely follow through on the behavior. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That last extension is really important. I\u2019ve been prepping this and reading the background \u2013 some of it, and it didn\u2019t even occur to me that you could apply it to yourself, and use it for journaling or something like that, to uncover \u2013 or maybe, rediscover the motivation that drove you start it in the first place, even though you lost sight of it, or it petered out, or whatever the hell it might be. Daniel Pink: Yeah, I mean, you could use it for going to \u2013 you could use it for going to the gym, to going to work out. Like, \u201cHow ready are you \u2013 how excited are you about \u2013 how motivated are you to work out right now?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a 2.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I say this to myself, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you a 1?\u201d \u201cWell, I know that probably I\u2019ll feel better if I work out, rather than if I don\u2019t work out. I know that, actually, if I don\u2019t do this aerobic exercise today, I probably might not have a chance to do it tomorrow, which means I\u2019m going to feel like crap.\u201d And so, you can turn it on yourself as well. It\u2019s all about those surfacing \u2013 one of the things that we\u2019ve done in management, and parenting, all other realms of life is that we have over \u2013 we\u2019ve overdosed on control. And control is not an effective way to motivate people for important things, because human beings only have two responses to control: they comply or they defy. And that\u2019s a history of human conduct basically; human being are either complying or defying with control. And so, we bandy control as a motivator, and look for ways for people to summon their own autonomous motivation for doing things. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, we talked at the very top of this interview about Johnny Bunko, and how you\u2019re ahead of the voter in the sense it didn\u2019t quite catch, you might have been a bit early with the manga format. In contrast, A Whole New Mind seems to really have resonated strongly, and it did catch. So, I\u2019d love to try to deconstruct why that was the case. And as one example, it\u2019s appealed so much to Oprah Winfrey that she gifted out \u2013 I would say \u2013 4500 copies to the Stanford graduating class of 2008, when she did her commencement speech there. Why do you think that is? And the subtitle, I should just mention, it\u2019s A Whole New Mind: Why Right-brainers Will Rule the Future,\u00a0 Why did this one take? Daniel Pink: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s hard to say. I think a reason that it took, is that it was a fairly original idea conveyed in a way that was easy to understand, and also had the advantage of probably being more right than wrong. So, the idea in that book is the following, that I was arguing then \u2013 I still believe it today \u2013 that the structure of our brain offers a metaphor for describing the future of work. And all your listeners know there\u2019s been a lot of stuff written about left brain and right brain over the year \u2013 most of it is just total garbage. But one of the \u2013 one of \u2013 what we know about our brains is that they\u2019re, actually, somewhat efficient and that over time, they\u2019ve divided up tasks. So, the left hemisphere specializes in one set of tasks, tasks that are logical, linear, sequential, analytical. The right hemisphere specializes in a different set of tasks, tasks that are about understanding context, about synthesis, and about simultaneous processes. And so, that division of labor in the brain, I think, offers a very powerful metaphor for understanding what I thought was going on in the world of work \u2013 and it continues to go on in the world of work. But, actually, to make sure I go the underlying science right, tearing a page from the Tim Ferriss playbook, I actually went to the National Institute of Health to get my own brain scan, see my own brain in action, which ended up being a profoundly disappointing experience, but that\u2019s another story for another day. And so, basically, the idea here is this, that the abilities that used be the most valuable in the economy \u2013 characteristic of the left hemisphere, logical, linear, sequential, analytical spreadsheet SAT abilities, those abilities are still necessary, they\u2019re no longer sufficient. And it\u2019s abilities more characteristic of the right hemisphere with the brain, artistry, empathy, inventiveness, big-picture thinking, those abilities are now the first among equals. And the reason for that is that it\u2019s a very hard-headed reason, that those kinds of abilities are easy to outsource, easy to automate, and that the left hemisphere abilities, the SAT spreadsheet abilities are easy to outsource, easy to automate, and less valuable in iterating something new, in dealing with the demands for new that comes from an abundant world. And so \u2013 actually, maybe, another reason that took, is that I basically came to a soft-hearted conclusion in a hard-headed way. There was a very clear economic argument for that, the three A\u2019s: Asia, automation, abundance. Reductive left-brain can be done cheaper overseas. The other \u201cA\u201d, automation, it can be done faster by computers and now, smart machines. And then, finally, abundance, that our material needs have been satisfied and over satisfied, that there\u2019s a premium now in coming up with something utterly new, and giving the world something it didn\u2019t know it was missing, which is very much of an artistic ability. And so, that\u2019s the argument in that took. And it\u2019s an argument, I think, that people resonated to, because they were seeing inklings in their own life, and they needed a way to describe it, categorize it, put words on it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, it seems like history has proven your prediction or description very accurate at this point, for sure. And it also would \u2013 it also occurs to me that this is another place, manga aside, where you and Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of Wired magazine are very much on the same page. You mentioned something in passing though, that I can\u2019t let go because I have to hear the separate story: why was your brain scan disappointing? Daniel Pink: Because it \u2013 I look at my brain, I was thinking my brain would be special, so I\u2019m kind of \u2013 it looked like any other brain I\u2019d seen \u2013 like I couldn\u2019t pick my own brain out of a lineup. So, that\u2019s what it was. I mean, it sort of \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say disappointing. It was \u2013 it\u2019s humbling, like the idea that here\u2019s my \u2013 I got this brain in my head, alright, and leaving aside the thorny issue of where does the brain and the mind begin or vice versa, my brain is largely responsible for who I am, and yet when I see a picture of it, it\u2019s completely unremarkable and looks like every other brain that\u2019s been scanned at that. There\u2019s something weird and humbling about that. Disappointing too. I don\u2019t know, I was expecting my brain would be cooler or something like that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Looking back at all of your books, do you find any commonalities or patterns \u2013 and we can also forge all sort of spurious correlations \u2013 but looking at the books that seemed to have struck a nerve, and those that, for whatever reason didn\u2019t perform up to your hopes. Daniel Pink: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think that when it comes to the actual performance of things, like how well a book does, that\u2019s something that\u2019s not fully \u2013 I mean, you know this \u2013 anybody knows this, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s fully in our control. And I\u2019m actually \u2013 I\u2019m actually more or less okay on that. I mean, it\u2019s disappointing when something doesn\u2019t do as well you want, but, to me, my criteria \u2013 my criterion is, \u201cDid I write the best book I possibly could write?\u201d And once you put it out there, there are so many other variables; you just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to take, or whether it\u2019s not going to take. So, I mean, I wrote a book \u2013 my very first book was a book called Free Agent Nation. That was not a monumental \u2013 that did okay, but it was not a monumental hit. It should have been, because I think I was right, but for whatever reason, I think it came out \u2013 like I think it just came out the wrong time \u2013 it should have come out slightly earlier. And so \u2013 so, on that \u2013 so, to me, how well a book does, there\u2019s so much randomness on that, I\u2019m not \u2013 I try not to lose any sleep over it. In terms of actual \u2013 is there a true line among all the books. That\u2019s an interesting question, and I can say from the creation point of view, there\u2019s absolutely not a true line. There is no intentional true line through these kinds of books, it\u2019s not as if I have mapped out somewhere on a whiteboard here in Pink Inc. world headquarters in Washington DC, this, like grand scheme to create the Pink [inaudible]\u00a0 in a certain fashion, in a certain timetable with certain things covered like that. Far from it, I just go from one thing to another \u2013 I just like, figure out, what am I going to do next? And as you know, Tim, writing a book is so difficult, it\u2019s so hard, it\u2019s so time-consuming, that if you\u2019re not in love with the idea, if you don\u2019t love working on it, you\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to be miserable for you. So, I just pick the next topic based on what I\u2019m really interested in, and what I want to spend a couple of years \u2013 a few years working on. So, I think it\u2019s possible that people can detect a true line \u2013 that readers can detect a true line \u2013 maybe they\u2019re seeing something that I\u2019m not. But if there\u2019s a true line, it\u2019s visible only retrospectively, it\u2019s not something that was intentional. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What was \u2013 speaking of difficulty and writing process, what if there is a \u2013 if you had to pick one, what has been the most difficult book for you to write and why? Daniel Pink: I think it was this \u2013 I think it was the last one, the last book that I wrote. Believe it or not, you would think that it would get easier over time, but it didn\u2019t. So, this last book, When\u00a0 about the science of timing, that was the most difficult book to write, partly because I went into that book with \u2013 so I started writing whole new mind having done some research and saying, \u201cHey, I think there\u2019s something going on here, like I think we\u2019re moving to this world.\u201d And, sort of, I had a theory of the case. With Drive, I had a book about motivation, I had looked at a lot of the research in motivation, I said, \u201cWoah, wait a second. People are missing like a huge story here.\u201d With When, I went in totally with questions rather than with any kind of theory of the case. I basically said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m making all making all kind of timely decisions in my own life. I\u2019m making them in a totally half-arsed way. I\u2019d like to make them in a better way, could somebody please give me some guidance?\u201d And I started looking around for guidance, and it didn\u2019t exist. And then I started looking at the research, and I realized that across all these domains of research, literally dozens and dozens, from the hard sciences, the molecular biology, to endocrinology, to the social sciences of economics and social psychology, to many, many domains, these scholars are asking very, very similar questions. What\u2019s the effect of time of day on what we do, and how we do it. How do beginning affect us? How do midpoints affect us? How do endings affect us? And so, I went in saying, \u201cWow, how do I make better timing decisions myself?\u201d, but I didn\u2019t have a theory of the case. And so the volume of research for this one was so monumental, there are so many studies out there, and there were so many different \u2013 in so many different fields, and field that \u2013 like molecular biology is not a subject that is at my fingertips, alright? I had a \u2013 I spent so much time \u2013 I basically would read those papers, I would read them through, and I would write down all the words that I didn\u2019t know the meaning of. And then I would look up those words, and then I would read it again, and I would read it a third time. And so, very painstaking. And then also because I didn\u2019t have a theory of the case, I just had questions rather than even a kind of skeleton or a shape of what I wanted to write, I had to figure that out. So, I probably did \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 17, 18 different outlines of that boo, so that was \u2013 you would think it would get easier, but it actually got \u2013 it would actually get harder. ee Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Eighteen outlines. What\u2019s such an outline look like? How long is it? What format, and \u2013? Daniel Pink: Oh, when I say an \u201coutline,\u201d it\u2019s relatively short. Just like one or two pages, nothing too comprehensive. I guess outline is \u2013 outline is \u2013 well, it\u2019s partly the right word, because I\u2019m a firm believer when it comes to speeches and when it comes to books. I\u2019m a believer in structure and shape. I think that those are what make some things work, and \u2013 I think it\u2019s through television shows, I think it\u2019s through podcasts, I think that structure and shape are very important. No, so here\u2019s the thing, Tim, I think your podcasts they don\u2019t necessarily have a structure, but they have a shape. There\u2019s no question they have a shape, alright. And so, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a difference between \u2013 you can have sculptures, beautiful sculptures that have right angles, and you can have other beautiful sculptures \u2013 like a Henry Moore sculpture that has no right angles at all, but it has a distinct, and memorable, and identifiable shape. But I\u2019m a big believer in structure and shape. And so, what I\u2019m doing there is that it\u2019s basically just my search for, \u201cHow do you organize the ideas, and what\u2019s the shape or the structure of the final product going to be? Because once I see the shape, I can a lot better work. But for this other book \u2013 it\u2019s like I\u2019m reading through 700 studies on all these kinds of stuff, and I\u2019m like, \u201cGood god, how do I even make sense of this? What do I put where?\u201d I started thinking about organizing it, do I organize this book about timing? Do I organize basically the way that we organize time? So, do I write about the hour, the day, the week, the month, they year, the lifetime? And that\u2019s a really bad way to do it. But I ended up \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why is that bad? How did you decide that was a bad approach? Daniel Pink: Because \u2013 for a couple of reasons. No. 1, the material didn\u2019t organize itself cleanly in that way. And No. 2, that struck me more as a \u2013 like a handbook, like a Farmer\u2019s Almanac, rather than an intelligent book of science journalism with takeaways. And more important, that\u2019s not a book I would want to read. And so, I abandoned that. But did I really abandon it? Because I actually ended up writing a whole chapter in this book, about the day. So, I ended up cleaving off some of that, and keeping it for other things. And so, it took me a long time to \u2013 it took me a long time to find the shape. And the way I found the shape, is I basically write it down on either what I called big-ass stickies, these giant posted notes, or on a whiteboard that I have in my office. But I went through many, many, many iterations. And on that, I have a somewhat social view of that, and that what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll run it past people to see what they think. And say, \u201cHey, what do you think if I organized the book that way, does that make any sense?\u201d, or, \u201cWhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d Or, What am I missing here? What\u2019s the weak spot there? But it took me a lot of time to \u2013 it took me a long time to find the shape of this book. That, coupled with the fact that the amount of research was so massive, it was actually \u2013 it was actually the hardest book I\u2019ve had to write. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You were doing the research as you were writing the book, in effect, it sounds like? Because you\u2019re coming into it with questions, but then you\u2019re having to digest all of the information that might lead, or might not lead to answers while you\u2019re writing it. Daniel Pink: Exactly. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Very, very hard. Daniel Pink: Exactly, you\u2019re so right about that; that\u2019s hard to do too. And a lot people \u2013 I mean, you know, as a writer, it\u2019s messier than that. There\u2019s this notion that, \u201cI\u2019m going to my research. And then, when my research is done, I\u2019m going to do my writing.\u201d\u00a0 Alright? And so, it \u2013 it never works that way. But when you have more questions, and you have \u2013 when you don\u2019t know the shape yet, and you still have a lot of questions, what happens is, \u201cI\u2019m going to do the research. Now, I\u2019m going to try to write down something about it.\u201d Crap. \u201cYou know what? Now, that I write it, I realize I\u2019m missing the whole thing here, and I\u2019ve got to do more research. So let me go back and do that.\u201d So, it\u2019s less of this kind of happy march \u2013 happy jump from here\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m going to go from this lilypad to that lilypad, and happily jump from each one to another like a delighted frog. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0There\u2019s a lot of task switching, that\u2019s exactly why the Four-Hour [inaudible] [00:56:22] for me, it was also, by far, the most difficult book, among other reasons to write. It\u2019s that I came into it intending to try all of these experiments, ask all these questions, and write the book somewhat chronologically as I\u2019m getting answers, and that was a very punishing way to approach things. But to look at the content, so going past the structure and looking at the content and findings of when, I was looking at an NPR interview you did, and teasing out some potential ways that I could apply the content from this book into my own life. And I\u2019m going to read a quote \u2013 you can feel free to correct it \u2013 but this is what I have as one very clear example, and basically, I\u2019m going to ask you what types of decisions have changed for you, or easy ways that people can think about making changes related timing. So, here\u2019s one \u2013 and I\u2019m going to truncate it a little bit, \u201cIn a lot of this research in big data, you see systemically poor performance in healthcare settings in the afternoon. Example, the incidence of handwashing inside of hospitals dramatically drops in the afternoon.\u201d And that seems like a bad thing to me \u2013 that\u2019s my voice, not yours. \u201cYou look at colonoscopies, endoscopies, find half as many [inaudible] in colonoscopies in afternoon exams versus morning exams even with the same population. Doctors are more likely to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics in the afternoon compared to the morning.\u201d And this seems \u2013 this is very, very actionable, right? If we are to trust the data, if the patterns, if the correlations hold, then you are certainly better off with same if you want to risk-mitigate \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that was English \u2013 risk-mitigate, I think I swapped the first two letter, that has a fancy psychological term. Daniel Pink: It\u2019s called a tip of the slongue. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Exactly. And you \u2013 you might come back to your undergrad linguistics \u2013 but what are other examples related to the when, the timing that people might be able to implement? Daniel Pink: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. There\u2019s so much stuff. I mean, the good news about that is that when I did, finally, wrestle the research to the ground, and figured how to structure it, it yielded so many great, great takeaways for readers. So, take a step back, what we know from a mountain of research \u2013 it took a while to figure this out \u2013 was we tend to move through the day in three stages: a peak, a trough, a recovery. Peak, trough, recovery. Now, most of us move through the day in that order, people who are night owls, people who have an evening chronotype, they move through the day in the reverse order: recovery, trough, peak. But what we know is that we know few things about human performance over the course of the day. The most important thing \u2013 and this \u2013 I wish somebody has told me this before I was 50, rather than once I was 50 \u2013 is that our cognitive abilities do not remain the same throughout the day; our cognitive abilities change during the day, and they can change in some dramatic ways, and they can change \u2013 they change in predictable ways. But how we perform depends on what we\u2019re doing, alright? So, what we know about the peak \u2013 which, again, for most of us, is the morning; for night owls it\u2019s later in the day \u2013 what we know about the peak is that the peak is when we are most vigilant. And what does \u201cvigilance\u201d mean? Vigilance means we\u2019re able to bat away distractions. And so, when we\u2019re vigilant, and can bat away distractions, that makes it the best time of analytic work, work that requires heads-down focus \u2013 writing a report, analyzing data, that kind of work. There\u2019s no \u2013 piles of research tell us that we should be doing our analytic work during the peak. The trough, that\u2019s the early afternoon, and \u2013 early to mid-afternoon, as you mentioned from the data on healthcare. A lot of bad stuff happens then. I mean, you have standardized test scores for students go down in the afternoon, you have \u2013 if you look at auto accidents, once you control for cars on the road \u2013 obviously, there are going to be more accidents when there are more cars on the road \u2013 but once you control for that, the most dangerous time to drive is 4 to 6 am, the second most dangerous time is 2 to 4 pm. During that midday trough, we should be doing more of our administrative work, we should be answering our routine emails, we should \u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve talked in the past, Tim, about batching \u2013 we should be batching our routine emails and answering them during the trough. We should be filling out our QPS reports; we should be filling out our expense reports \u2013 whatever. That kind of stuff that we have to do during the course of a day, that doesn\u2019t require a lot of major cognitive powers. Now, the recovery period \u2013 again, because this peak, trough, recovery is a pattern of mood, that also is a pattern of performance \u2013 the recovery period is actually really, really interesting. During the recovery period, we have elevated moods, our mood is better than during the trough, but we\u2019re less vigilant than during the peak. And so, it\u2019s really important to think about that combo platter here \u2013 that is you have higher mood but less vigilance. That makes it a good time for things like brainstorming, for things like insight work, where if you\u2019re too locked down and focused, you\u2019re not going to be that creative. And so, that degree of looseness, coupled with the elevated mood makes that recovery stage better for what are called insight problems, brainstorming, things that require iteration. And so, what we see is that if we recognize that our cognitive abilities don\u2019t say the same over the course of a day, that they change in predictable ways, and that what we do \u2013 that when we do something, it depends on what we\u2019re doing \u2013 we should be moving our analytic work to the peak, our administrative work to the trough, and out insight and creative work to the recovery. And it\u2019s that simple. And what the research tells us, also, is this. I mean, it\u2019s that time of day, explains about 20 percent of the variance in how people perform on cognitive tasks. So, if you think about that \u2013 that\u2019s a big deal. Like we can explain the variance \u2013 like if we have two people, Maria and Sally \u2013 and they perform differently in cognitive tasks, how do we explain that, alright? We say, how do we explain that variance in how people perform, Maria, Sally, and 18,000 other people perform on cognitive tasks, we say, \u201cOh, some people are smarter than other people; some people are more conscientious than other people, some people have more social advantage than other people.\u201d But what the research is telling us is that 20 percent of that variance is time of day. And so, what we should be doing is \u2013 and what we\u2019re not doing \u2013 is we should be making our \u201cWhen?\u201d decisions in a strategic way, rather than in the lazy, haphazard way with which we tend to make our When? Decisions. And so \u2013 and you see this most glaringly \u2013 and this is my rant of the year \u2013 you see this most glaringly with meetings in organizations. When we schedule meetings in organizations, the only criterion we use is availability. That\u2019s it. Who\u2019s available? We don\u2019t say, what kind of meeting is this? Is this a meeting where people have to be analytical? What kind of meeting is this? Is this about travel voucher policies? What kind of meeting is this? Are we brainstorming? Who\u2019s going to be there? Are they going to be morning people? Are they going to be intermediate people, are they going to evening people? We don\u2019t even ask those questions. We just say, \u201cWho\u2019s available?\u201d And it\u2019s causing \u2013 it\u2019s one of the easiest things, organizationally, to fix, and it\u2019s something that \u2013 at the unit of one, individuals can be lot more systematic and intentional about moving the right work into the right time slots. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What time of day do you generally wake up \u2013 personally? Daniel Pink: I wake up a little after seven. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And what do the first two hours of your day look like? Do you have any particular routines? Can you walk us through what that might look like? Daniel Pink: I don\u2019t have the detailed routines that you have \u2013 that you\u2019ve written about that you, actually, have experimented with, and thing like adrenaline, and meditation, or anything like that. Here\u2019s what I do: I wake up, alright? I take a shower; a shower helps me wake up, so I take a shower. I go downstairs, and I feel better if I see a member of my family. So, whoever happens to be awake \u2013 and I have two kids in college now, so I don\u2019t see them, but I have another kid who\u2019s still around, so I see him, I see my wife, and I like to have some protein for breakfast \u2013 that\u2019s a ritual and caffeine \u2013 protein and caffeine is my preferred breakfast. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s your go-to protein? Daniel Pink: You know what? I \u2013 I probably eat more hard-boiled eggs than almost any other person in America. I am keeping the hard-boiled egg industry in business \u2013 I\u2019m single-handedly responsible for the advent of hard-boiled eggs for sale in individually-wrapped packages in airports. I really think so. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Because once they \u2013 once they introduced that, I bought them all, and they\u2019re go, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s such demand for these hard-boiled eggs.\u201d So I was just \u2013 so I was actually saying to my wife \u2013 I eat so many eggs it\u2019s ridiculous. So, I don\u2019t have a cholesterol problem, fortunately. So, hard-boiled eggs or peanut butter. And then, what I do is, when I\u2019m in my writing day \u2013 and this is, actually, something I did better having read this book \u2013 when I\u2019m on writing days, I would go to my office, which, again, is behind my house, and I would not bring my phone with me, I would not turn on my email, and I will give myself a quota. And that quota is usually \u2013 is a word count. So, call it 700 words; I\u2019m a fairly slow writer. So, you have these people out there who are like, \u201cI write 3000 words a day,\u201d and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done that. And so \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m very, very slow. I may be slower than you are, even. Daniel Pink: Well, here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m slow in basically \u2013 I\u2019m basically slow in every \u2013 in every domain of my life. I\u2019m like [inaudible] I\u2019m a slow runner, I\u2019m a slow reader, I\u2019m a slow writer \u2013 I really heavily scrutinize my [inaudible] report to see if I have some kind of, like, tortoise gene in me somewhere, that somehow, one my ancestors in Latvia somehow made it with a tortoise at some point. And so \u2013 and so, what I would do, though, is I would come in and give myself that quota and I won\u2019t do anything until I hit that number \u2013 and then I\u2019m free to do other kinds of things, and then what I\u2019ll do is, I always \u2013 I\u2019ll have lunch, and then I will \u2013 I like to do \u2013 I have done a good job \u2013 especially after like this book changed the way that I organize my day. Because I do my analytic work better in the morning. So, this book compelled to clear out my mornings to do that analytic work, which, for me, is writing. I stuffed the administrative stuff off into the midday, and \u2013 batched emails and that kind of garbage. And then, I like to do interviews, especially when I\u2019m interviewing \u2013 like for book interviews, I like to do those later in the day, because I\u2019m a little bit more \u2013 I like the interviews to be a little bit more free-wheeling, I\u2019m not doing \u2013 I\u2019m not an investigative reporter, I\u2019m not conducting a deposition. I just want to hear people\u2019s stories, and what they want think about stuff. And so \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You\u2019re not quoting the Yale Law & Policy Review Volume 8, No. 2990? Daniel Pink: No. No. No. And so, I\u2019m not \u2013 so, I want that to be a little bit more iterative. And then, I actually end up exercising later \u2013 I end up exercising later in the day or in the early evening, I find that that works best for me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You said \u201con a writing day\u201d, when you are on book deadline, how many \u2013 what does your weekly structure tend to look like? Do you \u2013 is every day a writing day? How do you allocate \u2013 Daniel Pink: When I\u2019m writing a book, yeah. Because I\u2019m also a momentum player, so for me, writing every day is hugely important, when I\u2019m working on a book, or working on an article. So, I try to do that every single day \u2013 like seven days a week. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And do you have \u2013 do you have set periods of time between books? Do you decide in advance, \u201cI\u2019m going to take X period of time until I investigate another book.\u201d? What does your macro-planning look like? Daniel Pink: Macro planning, boy. My macro-planning is neither macro nor planned. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That \u2013 I think that needs to be on a motivational calendar somewhere. Daniel Pink: Yeah. Like for \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, put another way, if that question sucks \u2013 which it might, so it\u2019s also making a bunch of assumptions \u2013 how do you decide when to take on new projects or new books \u2013 if that\u2019s a better question? Daniel Pink: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I sort of go in \u2013 I sort of go in cycles. So, I\u2019m actually heading to that cycles right now. So, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time writing this book, and tried to make it as good a book as I can. In terms of actually spreading the word about it, I try to do that with \u2013 excuse the cliche \u2013 not leaving anything on the sidelines, so doing everything I possibly can, and being everywhere, being strategic about it all, trying new stuff, trying cool stuff, trying to get some momentum behind the book. And then when, sort of, white-hot center dissipates, and the book, we hope, has some momentum of it\u2019s own, then I\u2019ll go back and figure out the next project \u2013 whatever that project might be. And the way I do that is \u2013 I know this would shock you, Tim, in slow, laborious way \u2013 so what I do is, I have a \u2013 I\u2019m a sort of a \u2013 I use \u2013 I\u2019ll give you my mechanisms here. So, I use \u2013 believe it or not, I use a lot of paper folders, and I have a labeler. I use paper folders and a labeler to label my folders, because I was like a getting-things-done guy before getting things done with school [inaudible] I met David Allen in 1997, and I bought a labeler shortly after that \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I was going to ask if he\u2019s sending you your 5 percent royalties for the brainpower \u2013 you\u2019re like the guy who invented rollerblades or the [inaudible] 40 years before they became cool. Daniel Pink: Oh, no. I\u2019m a DTB devotee \u2013 I\u2019m not hardcore, I\u2019m not orthodox. But I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not reform either; I\u2019m sort of like in the middle. And so, anyway, I have these paper files with labels, and so when I read stuff or make notes to myself, I throw stuff in those files. I use Evernote and I also use Dropbox, and I just throw ideas in there. And what I do is, every six months or so, I go through those ideas of like, \u201cHey, this would be a cool television show to do; hey, this would be a cool article to write, hey this would be a cool book to write.\u201d And as I look at those ideas, maybe revisiting them every six months or so, I realize that most of them are just godawful ideas. One of my beliefs about the human brain is that \u2013 or creativity \u2013 is that in order to have good ideas, you have to have a lot of ideas. And so, I have a lot of bad ideas, which, I think is the only way for me to surface any decent ideas. So, I\u2019ll revisit those ideas, and then when it comes \u2013 and I\u2019ll cull. And what often happens when I cull, is that a few ideas end up just staying there over and over again, every six-month cycle. And then when I get to this point now, I would go back to all of those files and look more carefully, and say, \u201cHey, I sort of have, in my mind\u2019s eye right now, three possible projects.\u201d And so, I\u2019ll \u2013 then I\u2019ll more heavily vet those projects, read a lot more, talk to people, bounce ideas off of the people, and \u2013 and I like bouncing ideas off people, about [inaudible] in a moment. And then when it comes time to write a book, I will actually write a book proposal \u2013 even if I have the deal already done. So, if I have, like a two-book deal, like I have to write another book, but I\u2019ll still write a proposal for this next book \u2013 maybe a 40-page proposal, which allows me to figure out, is it there or there, is this something I really want to work on. I think a lot of things sound really good when you\u2019re just shooting the breeze; they sound less good if you have to say, \u201cCan I explain this \u2013 can I explain this idea, who\u2019s going to buy it, why it\u2019s cool, why it\u2019s original, why no one else is doing it, can I explain that in a coherent written document?\u201d That\u2019s a tougher order. And so, not everything lends itself to that. And I will bounce ideas off people. And so, I have a \u2013 actually, it\u2019s funny you mentioned Kevin at the beginning of the show. I have this one idea where I went out, and I went to \u2013 I made the pilgrimage to \u2013 what do you call this town \u2013 Pacifica, and made the pilgrimage to Kevin\u2019s house and said, \u201cI got an idea I want to run past you for a book.\u201d And Kevin was one of the people who said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a very good idea.\u201d And, unfortunately, he was not the only one who said that. And \u2013 d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Or fortunately, depending on how you look at it. Daniel Pink: Yeah, actually, fortunately \u2013 you\u2019re right. Fortunately, he was not the only one who said that. So, I abandoned \u2013 I actually ended up abandoning that idea, in part, because he was another brick in the wall of people saying, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Let\u2019s pause there for a quick second. Do you mind sharing \u2013 I don\u2019t think Kevin would care at all \u2013 what he or other people made as arguments, against you pursuing this idea? And you can tell us what the idea was or you can blur that. Daniel Pink: Yeah, I\u2019m going to be skittish about the idea, but let\u2019s just say it has to with morality; I wanted to write a book dealing with morality. And Kevin, who is a person of religious faith who is extraordinarily well-read \u2013 and among people who are very well-read and very intelligent, I think there is a dearth of people who have strong religious faith. It\u2019s just not an observation, it\u2019s not like a \u2013 judgment, one way or the other. And so I thought he was just an especially good person to run this idea past. And \u2013 I guess he and other \u2013 the theory of the case that I had, he and others had two criticisms of it \u2013 and they\u2019re not insignificant criticisms, Tim. The first criticism was, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, alright?\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0To begin with. Daniel Pink: Yes, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d And the second criticism was, \u201cYou\u2019re right, but it\u2019s not interesting.\u201d So \u2013 so, those are \u2013 like those are significant critiques. So, that\u2019s how I \u2013 that\u2019s generally how I do things. When I came up with this idea for When, it was an idea that I was kicking around there. And one of the ways that I knew it was a good idea was two things. No. 1 is that when I was writing the proposal \u2013 first of all, I was looking at the research, and I found myself wanting to do more research \u2013 which is always a good sign. Like, \u201cHoly crap, is that true? But what about Bobbity Bar? And I go look at. \u201cOh my God, Bobbity Bar says \u2013\u201d And so, I found myself wanting to do more research, that was one thing. And then, when I started writing the proposal for that, it was like \u2013 for me, it doesn\u2019t happen very often \u2013 but there were portions of it that were just like butter, I could just explain it so clearly, like, \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m going to try to find out, and here\u2019s why it matters.\u201d And it was like \u2013 it was like that \u2013 that scene in Jerry Maguire where he writes all night, and \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m taking the goldfish \u2013 minus the goldfish. Daniel Pink: And I was doing handstands against the wall and everything like that. So \u2013 and that\u2019s sometimes a good sign. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I think it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, that lack of or an overabundance of energy, I think is undervalued. How much the project actually gives you more to your tank. Daniel Pink: And I think \u2013 here\u2019s the thing. I think a lot of writers \u2013 I think a lot or people who come out as journalists \u2013 and before I started writing books, post-speechwriting, sort of as \u2013 an even through the time I was writing books, I did a lot of magazine articles, a lot of [inaudible] [01:17:31] magazine writing, which I liked \u2013 and I found a lot of journalists who would write an article, the article would do well, and they would get a book offer, and they would not properly vet it about whether they want it \u2013 because there are lot of ideas that you, maybe, want to go out on a few dates with. But there are very few ideas that you want to go steady with, let alone marry and have kids. And I think that books are basically you\u2019re marrying and having kids, and that\u2019s a very, very, very high bar. Tim Ferriss: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are a lot of great articles that should stay articles, and make very mediocre books. And it\u2019d be a potential, I suppose vice versa, where you go in the opposite direction. Daniel Pink: That\u2019s \u2013 I read \u2013 I want to say this anyway \u2013 I read one of those \u2013 it\u2019s in [inaudible] I read one of those this weekend where somebody had an article, did really well, they got a book deal, they turned it into a book. And it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. You know what? This thing has so much more impact as an article, rather than as a book.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, I want to dig in a little bit on this tickler file that you review every six months, because one of the most frequent questions I am asked is, \u201cHow do you pick projects? How do you vet projects?\u201d And you mentioned revisiting every six months, so a few mundane questions. Within Evernote, do you have any specific notebook that is tickler file or something like that? How do you keep track of all these ideas? Daniel Pink: I \u2013 I can actually look that up right now. What I do is I categorize them. So, what I have is I have a giant file called Misc or just like shards. But then I\u2019ll go through that and say, \u201cWait a second \u2013\u201d Let me think of an example here. \u201cWow, I\u2019m collecting a lot of articles about \u2013 here\u2019s the book I\u2019m not going to \u2013 like it could be interesting. At one point, it\u2019s like, \u201cSomeone should write a book about courage.\u201d What about courage? What do we know about courage? I\u2019m not going to do that. If one of your listeners wants to go out and do it, God bless you; I think it could be really interesting. So, I could go into the Misc file and say \u2013 the misc notebook, I guess, that it\u2019s called \u2013 is what do we know about courage? And I would go into this Misc note, and say, \u201cWow, I got a lot of articles about courage that\u2019s going berth a separate notebook on courage,\u201d and then I organize it that way. So, I\u2019ll have notebooks of Misc, and I\u2019ll have notebooks of\u00a0 particular ideas that I have, that end up being fuller because it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, this one has stuck around for a little bit longer than others.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And you mentioned during these reviews, you might say, \u201cOh, here\u2019s a cool idea for this, a cool idea for that. Oh, this could be really interesting; that could be really interesting.\u201d I would imagine, even after the second glance, and noticing that some of these ideas are coyote-ugly \u2013 you\u2019re like, \u201cHoly shit, how did I think that was a good idea?\u201d \u2013 even after removing the flies in the soup, you still \u2013 Daniel Pink: I like that. I like that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You still have way \u2013 you could drown under the weight of these kinds of cool ideas; you have many things that could be interesting. How do you then \u2013 what are the parameters, or thought processes, questions, anything that help you to get down to the three finalists? Daniel Pink: Okay, what do we \u2013 so, it would be \u2013 it\u2019s really like what would I want to spend a couple of years on? And so, if I really thought of \u2013 like, maybe, courage would be an example. Like, I\u2019m sort of, interested in that. But it\u2019d be like \u2013 I would rather read a good book about courage than write a book about courage \u2013 I\u2019m serious. You know what I mean? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No, sure. That makes perfect sense. Daniel Pink: And it\u2019s like \u2013 and so, when you go face to face with that, and you start saying, \u201cDo I really want to do this?\u201d, then I think your soul, at some level, tells you \u201cHey, this is \u2013 you\u2019re into this; you\u2019re not so into that.\u201d And so, I think that\u2019s the \u2013 I think that\u2019s the initial cut. But it\u2019s also the one reason why I \u2013 so to get to the three finalists is actually kind of intuitive in a way \u2013 and there\u2019s no magic number to three, it could be four. And so, this is one reason why I would write book proposals because it just forces me to \u2013 it forces me to reckon with the idea, and actually, make it real. And there\u2019s this principle that I learned in college \u2013 at a writing course in college \u2013 and I actually ended up giving a commencement speech around this idea of \u2013 I\u2019ll spare you that for now. But the idea was \u2013 the idea was valid, it was a revelation to me when I was \u2013 whatever \u2013 21 years old. So, I had this \u2013 so, there\u2019s this essay-writing course, sort of higher-level essay-writing course, and I had a draft of an essay or something like that. I went into the professor, his name is Charlie Warnock \u2013 I went to Northwestern, and he still teaches at Northwestern. And so, Charlie gave me some feedback, and I was all insistent, \u201cOkay, I can fix this, I can move this part over here, maybe I\u2019ll do another piece over here, maybe I\u2019ll do another piece over here.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no, no, Dan. That\u2019s not your problem here. The problem is that you don\u2019t know what you think. That\u2019s why this essay sucks, this drafted essay. You don\u2019t know what you think.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201csucks\u201d, but that\u2019s they this essay \u2013 that\u2019s why this essay stinks. And then he said something to me \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I don\u2019t want \u2013 to sound glorified, or sound like something that is confected where a swirl of music would come up behind me in this, but what he said is that \u2013 but it\u2019s words I\u2019ve never forgotten \u2013 truly \u2013 he said, \u201cSometimes, you have to write to figure it out. Sometimes, you have to write to figure it out.\u201d And that was a revelation to me, because at the time, I was in this mode, very traditional schooling mode, where \u2013 sort of like we were talking about before \u2013 you do your research, then you write; you make your outline, then you write. And what he was saying to me is that, real writers, it\u2019s more dynamic than that; sometimes you have to write to figure it out. And that was transformative for me. And so, that, sort of, gave me permission to say, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know \u2013 like I can change my mind midway writing something, I can start writing without knowing fully, exactly what it is I\u2019m going to say.\u201d And to me, that\u2019s the why I write book proposals. It\u2019s that I write to figure it out. And a lot of times, what I figure out is, \u201cThis is not a book,\u201d or, \u201cThis is not a book I want to write.\u201d So, I had this one moment a few years ago, where \u2013 a while ago, now, actually. Ten years ago, even more \u2013 where I sent \u2013 it was like winter, like late \u2013 second half of December. And I said to my wife, and I said, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you just take our guys, our kids \u2013 three kids \u2013 just go see your parents, just go for a week, or two weeks, or something like that. I\u2019ve got to get a book proposal done, I\u2019m distracted. It\u2019s like if you guys \u2013 when you guys \u2013\u201d When my family leaves like I live like an animal. I mean, I just \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s like a racoon that got into the house. Daniel Pink: No, truly. I mean it is raccoon-like, in that I literally eat of out containers. So, like my family leaves, I eat of containers, don\u2019t shave, and basically work around the clock, except for a few ESPN breaks. That\u2019s basically what I do when my family is gone. And so, I will \u2013 so I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to write a proposal for this next book.\u201d And after about seven or eight days, I called Jessica at her parents\u2019 house, and I said, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got some good news and some bad news. The good news is that you can come home now. The bad news is that I realize this is not a book.\u201d But I was only writing to figure out that allowed me to do that. So, I actually wrote, basically, one and a half proposals before writing the When proposal. Because I had a couple of ideas that ran \u2013 I said, \u201cOkay, this is sort of interesting, but let me write to figure it out.\u201d And what I realized in \u2013 two very important things: one, it\u2019s not a book; maybe it\u2019s an article. Or two, it\u2019s not a book that I want to write. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0There are a few things, raccoon behavior aside, that I want to follow up on. The first is just to highlight something for people listening, and that is how liberating it is to think about writing as something you do not when you have your ideas ready, but something you do to figure out your ideas. Daniel Pink: Absolutely. When did you learn that? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s been, I would say, reiterated \u2013 it\u2019s something that is easy to forget, particularly if you have \u2013 or something that you\u2019ll willfully forget if you have a perfectionist streak, and a penchant for procrastination. So, if you want to wait until all your docs are in a row so you can go to the debutante ball pristine and blow over any socks off, it\u2019s easy to forget this. But it sounds like the cat came back the very next day But Kevin Kelley \u2013 just to incant his name again \u2013 he has emphasized this to me; he\u2019s such a prolific writer and emphasized this to me a number of years ago. And I want to say it goes back, probably to McPhee, who also \u2013 much like you \u2013 obsessed with structure. And there\u2019s a book \u2013 I think it\u2019s called Draft No. 4. Daniel Pink: Yeah, it just came out. Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It has some \u2013 some really fascinating explorations of this for those people who really want to get into weeds. He\u2019ll also do it graphically, he\u2019ll draw out diagrams of what the structure looks like \u2013 which appeals to me. But trying to stay on track here, I would say Kevin is the most \u2013 well, you are the most recent person, but a number of years ago, Kevin emphasized to me, and probably before that, McPhee. So, it\u2019s really liberating, No. 1, to embrace that \u2013 even if you\u2019re not fully convinced it\u2019s the case. And I also want to give a little bit of context for people who may not be familiar with book proposals. So, book proposals, in the world of non-fiction books \u2013 I suppose I should take a further step back and say, in the world of non-fiction \u2013 so novels and fiction are totally different; in many cases, you need to finish that puppy, before anyone will tell you if your baby is ugly or not, which is \u2013 has to be terrifying. It must be. In non-fiction, you create a book proposal before you write your book. And the book proposal \u2013 and feel free to interject at any point \u2013 but the book proposal is, in effect, a business plan and an overview/executive summary for your book. And there\u2019s a lot \u2013 you find with the best book proposals, and the best startup pitches \u2013 which take the form of a deck, say Powerpoint or something like that very often \u2013 they\u2019re exceptionally similar, the ingredients that make a good startup pitch and the ingredients that make a good book proposal are very similar. But that is \u2013 and I\u2019d love to, actually, know what the structure of your book proposals look like. I mean, I know what ingredients I would potentially include in a book proposal, but what does the table of contents look like for one of your book proposals? Daniel Pink: Yeah. I\u2019d have to go back and look. I think they vary a little bit, but they probably have some core design elements. One of them is \u2013 and it\u2019s questions that I want to ask myself, which is, what is this book, what\u2019s it about? Pretty simple question. But, I think, the more important question is, \u201cWhy does it \u2013 why does it fill a need that hasn\u2019t been filled yet?\u201d Which is, basically, very similar \u2013 I use the same business plan analogy that you do on book proposals; it\u2019s sort of like a business. Like why \u2013 why is it providing \u2013 why is it filling a need that hasn\u2019t, otherwise, been met? Like, basically, if you draw a map of the marketplace, what part of the marketplace of ideas is this \u2013 does this cover that hasn\u2019t been been covered? Is it this \u2013 and I don\u2019t even mean it in \u2013 I sometimes would use the high concept pitch of, \u201cIf X meets Y,\u201d which I actually think is actually a very useful heuristic in figuring out ideas. So, for instance, I pitched A Whole New Mind as a future\u00a0 [inaudible] Seven Habits of Highly Effective People \u2013 which I thought was a pretty good pitch. And so \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s very common in pitching films also, just to highlight \u2013 it\u2019s really useful. Daniel Pink: Yeah, it is a \u2013 it\u2019s a heuristic. And basically, to me, it says, if you think about a map of the territory \u2013 if you think about a map of ideas out there, why is no one over here on this part of the map? Like, \u201cShow me where, on the map, your idea is, and let\u2019s make sure that someone hasn\u2019t gotten there first. And then tell me why someone hasn\u2019t gotten then there first. What are they missing? \u201d And so, in the case of When for instance, I say, \u201cWell, the reason they\u2019re missing, is that everybody thinks timing is an art, but it\u2019s actually a science.\u201d \u201cOh, okay, got it. That\u2019s why no one is there.\u201d And so, I\u2019ll talk about, what\u2019s it about, where does it fit into the marketplace of ideas, why is it original \u2013 and this is also really important: who is it for? And the big mistake that everybody writing a book \u2013 and if there\u2019s one takeaway from this conversation for prospective writers out there, it\u2019s this: the mistake that writers make \u2013 and I think business people make, too, in their pitches \u2013 is when they say, \u201cWho is if for? Who is the audience? Who is the customer?\u201d, they always want to say \u201cEverybody.\u201d And it\u2019s not; it\u2019s never everybody. And what I try to do, if I\u2019ve included a section of, \u201cWho is not going to buy that book?\u201d, I would have a \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Would you have a section on who isn\u2019t the customer. Daniel Pink: Right. Who is not going to buy this book? Because I think that that\u2019s the only way to think carefully about \u2013 because books are not a mass medium, and even media products, in general, are no longer mass medium \u2013 mass media; they\u2019re no longer mass \u2013 and it\u2019s like who is \u2013 and so, I\u2019ll have bullets in there saying, \u201cWho is not going to buy this book?\u201d And that helps define the audience too. And also, I try to \u2013 and that\u2019s all \u2013 that\u2019s really all that it is. But if you know what the book is about, where it fits into the marketplace of ideas, or why it\u2019s different from anything else that came before it, and who it\u2019s for, I think those components are really essential. But that fourth component is \u2013 and I say this to writers too \u2013 tell me who the book is not for; tell me who\u2019s not going to buy this book. And people have a hard time saying it, \u201cOh, everybody would buy this book.\u201d Somebody pitched to me an idea \u2013 somebody came to me once with an idea of a book about \u2013 somebody was asking advice, it was a book about \u2013 I hope I don\u2019t \u2013 I think the book might have gotten published, I don\u2019t want reveal the name \u2013 it was a book about the history of yoga in America \u2013 or maybe it was \u2013 yeah, I think the history of yoga. And it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, okay, that\u2019s cool. So, I think a lot of people who do yoga might be interested in that.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I think people who don\u2019t do yoga are going to be interested in this.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not. Like, people who don\u2019t do yoga don\u2019t care about the history of yoga, alright? There are a shitload of people in America who do yoga, that\u2019s a pretty good audience right there. But don\u2019t tell me every \u2013\u201d You know what I mean? So, for me, it\u2019s like \u2013 for me, it\u2019s like my books. It\u2019s like I know that the \u2013 like this book about the Science of Timing, I know that certain people in my neighborhood in northwest Washington DC who read \u2013 are of a certain age, and read only literary fiction, and 700-page biographies of founding fathers \u2013 they\u2019re not going to read this book. They\u2019re not going to read it. They might be their neighbors, they\u2019re not going to read one of my books. And so, I think that\u2019s really, really important about, who is the book not for? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s also an indicator of a focus and logical/rational thinking in a sense, right? Because if you\u2019re \u2013 for instance, just to diverge for a minute \u2013 but if you\u2019re in the world of investing \u2013\u00a0 where I spent a long time with early-stage startups, 17 years or so \u2013\u00a0 if they say, \u201cEveryone is my customer,\u201d there is a very real risk that if you give them X number of dollars, you give then $1 million, that they could be developing Dropbox for, say, early tech adopters in the first wave and they need to get from zero to 10,000 users, and if there is an 80 percent off-deal for something like shopping mall circulars or something, that they would jump on that, and piss away all their money. And it\u2019s certainly, I think, books \u2013 a lot of books fail \u2013 and this true of presentations too \u2013 from too much miscellaneous information, not too little \u2013 if that makes any sense. Daniel Pink: Absolutely. It\u2019s a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s really just a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s really just a matter of focus. And going back to this speech\u00a0\u00a0 thing, I mean one of the \u2013 one of the pieces of advice, to the extent that anybody ever asked me for advice on giving speeches and what not \u2013 and it sounds a little like a \u2013 it sounds like a Zen Koan-ish sort of phrase \u2013 but basically, my point is, say something important rather than saying important things. And I find out, a lot of times, people say something important, rather than say important things. Because I think a lot of times, people like to try to stuff within the skin all the things they\u2019ve found out, all the things that they know, and they end up not saying anything important. And so \u2013 that\u2019s the reason for doing \u2013 anyway, you get the idea. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, I know. And there are so many comparable examples. If, for instance, you look for this vetting of ideas by putting together a short synopsis of some type. And there\u2019s one example, for instance \u2013 and I believe this is true, I\u2019ve certainly heard it and read about it a few times, and I know a fair number of people who work at Amazon, but they\u2019d have to confirm \u2013 but, I think, Ian McAllister, who used to, at least, be a general manager at Amazon, talked about this, is walking backwards. And for new initiatives, the product manager who would be in charge of developing, say, a new product, has to write an internal press release which announces the finished product. And that has to focus on, effectively, exactly what you said. And I\u2019m quoting you from [inaudible], but, \u201cCentered around the customer problem how current solutions, internal or external fail, and how the new product would blow existing solutions away.\u201d And it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s the same thing. If you can\u2019t write that press release, how on earth are you going to navigate the decision-tree of getting to a product that finds its feet? I mean, it could be very difficult \u2013 and not so say you don\u2019t iterate, but it\u2019s a good \u2013 it\u2019s a good filter through which you can at least catch the detritus that shouldn\u2019t make it to step 2. Daniel Pink: Oh, man, I have to say, I\u2019m your [inaudible] of course, on that press release technique. I\u2019ve literally done that, working with \u2013 I think it\u2019s helpful for non-profit groups that I\u2019m involved in. So if a nonprofit group wants to do a big project, but they\u2019re all over the place, they don\u2019t know exactly what they want to do \u2013 and I literally did this. I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Here\u2019s what I think the project is. Let me write a press release from two years from now, and I\u2019ll send it around.\u201d And it ended up being a \u2013 I had to get an idea from Amazon too \u2013 and it ended up being this thing that was really, really focused. So, \u201cThe Bobbitybar Group, announced, today, that it was doing Bobbitybar,\u201d and then it\u2019s like \u2013 and it had quotes and things in it, and it ended up being this focal point on \u2013 for the whole organization on, \u201cWhat are we actually trying to accomplish here?\u201d So, I second that emotion there. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And just to return to another thing that you said \u2013 which I\u2019ll paraphrase here as, if everyone is your customer, no one\u2019s your customer \u2013 another filter or question that I use \u2013 or have used, I\u2019m not really in startup game anymore \u2013 but have used a lot with startups, because they\u2019ll ask me to review, say, a landing page, and look at copy, and messaging, and so on. And before I would review it \u2013 if, with no further information I have to review it based on my pair of eyes, and my perspective, and my particular problems, that I can try to empathize and put myself in other people\u2019s shoes. But I have to know whose shoes to put myself in. And so, I\u2019ll ask them, \u201cIf you could only have 1000 people sign up for this, who would they be and why?\u201d Like, describe, for me \u2013 and this isn\u2019t a politically correct exercise \u2013 like what is gender, race of that matter is. Or maybe it doesn\u2019t. Where do they live? What magazines or websites do they read? What is their household income? Like really get granular about what these people have in common. Like, \u201cDo you want all the readers of People magazine? Do you want the 2000 people who [inaudible]? Do you want something in between? Like, really describe that for me.\u201d And only once that\u2019s been done can I actually get feedback on modifying any of the features or copy or messaging on a particular page.\u201d So, it\u2019s \u2013 these principles really transfer to a lot of different areas. Well, let me ask just a handful of additional questions, and then maybe we can do a round two sometime. But you\u2019ve been talking a lot about the decisions you\u2019ve made, the routines that you have \u2013 and although you\u2019re very self-effacing, somebody could look at your bio and be very intimidated, and assume that you step up to the plate and hit home runs more often than not. Could you tell us about, maybe, a specific \u2013 if you\u2019re open to it \u2013 difficult period that you\u2019ve gone through, or down period, challenging period or failure \u2013 it could be any of those things \u2013 and what you did to get back on your feet, or the decisions you made that helped you then get back on firm ground, if anything comes to mind? Daniel Pink: Sure, sure, sure. There are all kinds of things. I mean, I hate to keep going back to the \u2013 I hate to keep going back to the law school days. But I did leave law school after my first year, and I hated it so much that I went to India instead, and I traveled around \u2013 I traveled around India, incredible life-changing experience because I was a young guy \u2013 whatever old I was,\u00a0 25, 26 years old. And at the time \u2013 it was a while ago, so at the time, India was even cheaper \u2013 well, much, much cheaper than it was. So, if you\u2019re like a 25-year-old dud traveling on your own with a tiny little bit of money in your pocket, you can make it go very, very, very far. And so \u2013 so, at the time, I guess I felt like \u2013 because I didn\u2019t do very well in my initial foray into law school, I didn\u2019t really like it, I was pretty miserable, I felt I had made a terrible decision, and I, at some level, just tried to escape. And the way I got back into it was, essentially saying, \u201cOkay, if I\u2019m going to do this, then I\u2019m going to try to figure out what are the one or two things that I can find valuable in this experience, and just try to power my way through. And I guess that\u2019s all that I \u2013 I guess that\u2019s all that I did to overcome that. But I felt pretty bad about how I didn\u2019t do very well, I didn\u2019t really like it, I felt I had made a ruinous decision about how my life was going to go. And when I woke up and matured a little bit, I said, \u201cOkay, some people make \u2013 like bad things actually happen to people.\u201d And I think going to India was actually helpful in that regard too, because, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not living in a tar paper shack with filthy water; I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m not self-actualizing fast enough for a 25-year-old middle-class person. That\u2019s not a real problem.\u201d And so, I think that, sort of putting the problems in perspective, and just trying to find some goodness in what you\u2019re doing next \u2013 and also, I just \u2013 like really deriving specific lessons from these kinds of failure. And I think that\u2019s another part that\u2019s really important to me. It\u2019s that, rather than \u2013 rather than simply allow this hazy notion of what you learn, I \u2013 again, I\u2019m a big believer in writing things down \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a better example of that. And this is \u2013 I don\u2019t want to call this a major failure, because it\u2019s not that significant. But I did a TV show for National Geographic, and I worked with a TV series, and I worked with some really great people, and we put on a really, freaking great show. And it didn\u2019t get picked up for a second season. And \u2013 and so it was disappointing, but it\u2019s not like a massive failure, it\u2019s not like anything real in life. But at that time, what I did is I said \u2013 I basically created a file and said, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s what I learned from this experience, things that I learned from this experience.\u201d One, I like working with really talented people, people who helped me perform better. Two, I don\u2019t like to involved in projects that I don\u2019t have full creative control over. Three, working with people in traditional television can be very perilous, because they\u2019re subject to all kinds of pressures that are out of their control. And so, you have this experience where things didn\u2019t go the way you wanted to, but if you actually, literally, write down the lessons, I think you can get something positive out of it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And was the writing down of these lessons more of a cathartic exercise, or are these \u2013 would you go back and revisit that? Daniel Pink: You know what? Like for me, a lot of times, what I would do is, for me, and sometimes, certainly writing things down, it seems the act of writing it down is enough to solidify it. So, I\u2019ll do the kind of thing where, before a talk or something like that, I will write an outline \u2013 basically, I know what I want to do, and then I\u2019ll take notes and write an outline of the speech and the things I want to hit, and then I literally would not look at it; like I, sometimes, won\u2019t even bring it with up with me. I\u2019ll forget to bring it up with me. Because the act of \u2013 the act of actually memorizing it is really what gives it its oomph. But what I don\u2019t want \u2013 what I\u2019m trying to say in a somewhat ham-handed way is that, like when you want to \u2013 you don\u2019t want those kinds of lessons to be hazy too much. You want to, actually \u2013 like, \u201cWhat specific thing did I actually derive from this?\u201d, and I think that\u2019s really useful. There\u2019s also a great technique that Tina Seelig has used \u2013 Tina Seelig who\u2019s at Stanford has used \u2013 which she talks about \u2013 she writes a failure resume. So, she has a resume of all her failures, and then with each one, what she learned from it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0When would she use something like that? Daniel Pink: I mean, she keeps it for herself, but she would use it \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, I see. It\u2019s an ongoing working document, just like a regular resume. Daniel Pink: Yeah, yeah. An ongoing working document that basically \u2013 so you can look at and say, \u201cOh, I made a lot of mistakes but here\u2019s what I learned from it, and don\u2019t make the same mistakes the second time.\u201d I don\u2019t mind making mistakes, what I don\u2019t like is making the same mistake twice. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0With the \u2013 two questions on India: why India? And then second, how did you decide to find the compelling benefits of continuing with law school versus changing course? Daniel Pink: Let\u2019s see. You know what? I think \u2013 okay, on the second one, I think I was too risk-averse to change course fully; I think that would have been too much, too much of a [inaudible] narcissist to leave altogether. I probably would have \u2013 I probably would have felt like an abject failure, so I don\u2019t even think that was in the cards. So, on the why India, a couple of reasons. I had always been fascinated by it; I knew that I could get around, that the previous summer I had been to Southern Africa, and it was the first \u2013 I had never been out of the country, until I was 23 years old, never been \u2013 And so the first time I left the country, I went to Southern Africa on a \u2013 I raised some money to do this \u2013 to do a project there. And that was a revelation, like, \u201cHoly crap, this world is lot bigger than I thought.\u201d And so, I wanted to go to someplace that wasn\u2019t Europe, or someplace that was a little bit different from \u2013 a little bit more different from the United States. And so, India was a place that I had always been fascinated by, it spoke English and it was cheap. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s a compelling combination for someone leaving law school for a period of time.\u00a0 Daniel Pink: Yeah, when you\u2019re 25 years old \u2013 or however old I was \u2013 and you have a little money in your pocket, you can go so far on so little money; it was unbelievable to me \u2013 especially if you\u2019re willing to sleep \u2013 to take overnight trains rather than pay for a place to stay, or leave in these \u2013 go to sleep in these places where there\u2019s just a row of beds on a balcony and mosquito nets over each one. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, the \u2013 I mean, travel is one of those gifts that keep on giving in a sense \u2013 I would put books in that same category. Daniel Pink: Yeah, I agree. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You\u2019ve written a lot of books, you\u2019ve read even more books. Besides your own \u2013 and I\u2019ll just \u2013 going to segue into a couple of short questions \u2013 what books \u2013 are there any books that you\u2019ve gifted often to other people, or repeatedly given to people. Daniel Pink: Yeah. Oh, yeah. So, they\u2019re probably books that you\u2019ve \u2013 I mean, it might have been books that you\u2019ve covered in your show here. So, one of them is Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott, one of the greatest things ever. I come back to that advice so many different times, it\u2019s the same even in the Pink household, where we\u2019ll just say \u2013 like one member of my family would say to the other who\u2019s struggling, \u201cOkay, bird by bird. Bird by bird.\u201d And so, I am a huge \u2013 and I stumbled into this book \u2013 I remember where I got this next book, I got it in the airport in San Francisco, in the bookstore in the SFO. And for some reason, I picked it up because it had this really weird cover. But one of the first editions of The War of Art by Steven Pressfield had this kind of silvery cover to it. And I bought that book in \u2013 I think it was a campus bookstore in SFO, just because it\u2019s \u2013 I went, \u201cOh, it\u2019s silver cover, and it\u2019s really short.\u201d I got it and it was like, \u201cOh, my god. I can\u2019t believe how good this book is.\u201d And so, I have even have a little sign on my desk here that says, \u201cBeat the resistance.\u201d So, I\u2019ve given that book a out a lot too. So Pressfield and Lamott. And then \u2013 man, I have to say, Victor Frankl\u2019s Man\u2019s Search for Meaning is up there too.\u00a0 Less \u2013 I\u2019ve given that out less, but that\u2019s a hugely important book for me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, that\u2019s one of those books I really need to re-read. And I think you\u2019ve actually spoken about \u2013 let me get this right, I was about to say \u201cAnimal House,\u201d but that is not right \u2013 Animal Farm. Daniel Pink: Oh my god, Animal Farm is on one the greatest books ever. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And how you \u2013 it\u2019s a completely different experience as a book, at different points in your life. Daniel Pink: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And the last time I read Man\u2019s Search for Meaning was probably \u2013 I would say seven to ten years ago. And a lot has changed in my life in that period of time. I think that that is worthy of a re-read. And have you \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019ve re-read each of these books also, also Bird by Bird, The War of Art, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, yourself; you\u2019ve read these more than once. Daniel Pink: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019ve read it more than once. Yeah. But I\u2019m not a chronic re-reader; there are some people who are regularly \u2013 there are relatively few books that I have re-read. But those I absolutely have. And once \u2013 I had another experience in college \u2013 the only thing I remember in college are shards of things that the professors said, basically one-liners. But I had a professor, once in college who \u2013 in an American Studies course, he assigned us to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. So, you\u2019re in college, and your professor assigns you to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, people are like, \u201cOh \u2013\u201d because everybody read that book in high school. And he said something \u2013 he said the following words, he says, \u201cI know you read that book, but you haven\u2019t read that book,\u201d meaning the person you are today. And that ends up being \u2013 it ended up being true. So, I\u2019ve read Animal Farm at different points in my life, and had different views on it. I\u2019ve read Great Gatsby] at different points in my life. I have seen the play, Death of a Salesman \u2013 I don\u2019t know, probably seven times. And each one feels a little bit different to me. I had a completely different view of Death of a Salesman once I became a father versus before I became a father. I had another view of Death of a Salesman before I knew about \u2013 had read about psychopharmacology and mental illness and after I did. And so, I think that that \u2013 I think those kinds of experiences are really fascinating. Animal Farm, I was like, \u201cOh, really cool. It\u2019s about the Soviet Union and how power corrupts, and blah, blah, blah.\u201d And now, I read the book, it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, this book is basically about organizational dysfunction. Who cares whether it was supposed to be about the Soviet Union, this book is about the Acme Widget Corporation and how screwed human organizations are.\u201d Like this \u2013 I think that Animal Farm should be in every organizational behavior class in an MBA program. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s another one I need to re-read \u2013 not a long book, either. I mean, I read that in sixth-grade or something. I mean, completely unequipped. Daniel Pink: You\u2019ll see it \u2013 you\u2019ll see it completely differently. That\u2019s a great book. I\u2019ve read [inaudible] multiple times too. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Also a very timely book. Daniel Pink: Well, on that front I read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale for the first time. I was, sort of, 30 years late to it, but I read, and I loved that book. I have a whole \u2013 I\u2019m not joking around, and if you want validation, I\u2019ll send you a photograph of it \u2013 I basically have a stack of books right here that are, basically, dystopia books that include Philip Roth The Plot Against America, an Octavia Butler book, Sinclair Lewis\u2019 It Can\u2019t Happen Here, another sci-fi book by Eliot Peper called Cumulus, and other one called Infomocracy by Malka Older. I have a whole \u2013 I\u2019m basically \u2013 I have a whole pile of dystopian works. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why is that? Why do you \u2013 why do you read so much dystopia? Daniel Pink: Because I want to understand the current moment more clearly. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, this might be \u2013 this might be an appropriate next question. It doesn\u2019t have to be related to what you just said, but if you could put a short message on a billboard \u2013 metaphorically speaking \u2013 to get a word, a quote, a question to millions or billions of people, what might you put on that billboard? Daniel Pink: Well, it\u2019s interesting, because I think it is related to what we\u2019re just talking about \u2013 or maybe, the fact that you asked it in this context made me relate it. But one of the \u2013 one of the things that I would write would be \u201cAssume positive intent.\u201d That would fit very nicely on a billboard. Assume Positive Intent. Because I think \u2013 and I\u2019ve changed my view on this, Tim. I\u2019ve actually, in some ways, become \u2013 I\u2019ve certainly gone the reverse \u2013 like, basically, the general view is that people are idealistic when they\u2019re young, and cynical when they\u2019re older, and I\u2019ve actually become less cynical as I\u2019ve gotten older. And the other thing is, basically, on politics, like there\u2019s this old line in politics that everybody dies a Republican. Because, as you get older, and you have something to conserve, you become more conservative; I find myself going, actually, the opposite direction as I understand more about the world. But the point of all that \u201cAssume positive intent\u201d is that, I think \u2013 and it goes to our politics right now \u2013 is that a lot of times. I don\u2019t know \u2013 I just think, like, your default \u2013 you know this already \u2013 our default settings are so important in any realm of our lives. And I think, a lot of times, if your default setting is that people have \u2013 everybody you deal with has negative intent, that\u2019s going to lead you down one pathway, there\u2019s no question about it. And here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I really \u2013 my experience as a human being is that some people, obviously, have negative intent, but most people do not; most people actually have positive intent. So, my view it that if you assume positive intent on the part of others and let them disprove that, that\u2019s a better way to go, than to assume negative intent and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to assume that you have negative intent, Tim Ferriss, until you prove that you actually have positive intent.\u201d I think just doing the reverse is better: assume positive intent. Not that \u2013 I\u2019m not Pollyanna here, I don\u2019t think everybody has positive intent. But I think most people do, and if you just make that your default setting, you\u2019re going to have better interactions with people, you\u2019re going to learn a lot more. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The default setting \u2013 default state, as you put it \u2013 in this case, creates a completely different experience of reality. Daniel Pink: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Whether it\u2019s guilty until proven innocent, as you look at everyone and anything around you, or innocent until proven guilty. And I remember you were talking about these one-liners, these shards that stick in the mind. I remember \u2013 I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t recall who said this to me, but they said, if you go out one day, and you walk around, and you meet an asshole, that person is an asshole; if, on the other hand, you go out and everyone you meet is an asshole, you are the asshole. And if you assume that everyone has negative intent, you yourself become that which you loathe. Daniel Pink: Nice point. That\u2019s a really good point. That\u2019s a really good point. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I love that: assume positive intent. Well, it \u2013 Daniel Pink: It also fits on a billboard. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It does. Daniel Pink: That\u2019s the other \u2013 I mean to actually take that thing very literally, it\u2019s like literally picturing in my head, like what would be \u2013 what could fit on the billboard? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, I think that\u2019s a great place to wrap. I mentioned a few things at the top of the show, danpink.com, @danielpink on Twitter, Facebook/danielhpink. Is there anything else that you would like to mention as a closing comment, request, and ask of the audience \u2013 anything else you would like to say? Daniel Pink: No, I mean we\u2019ve covered a lot \u2013 we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, and if people have listened this far, god bless them. I mean, I can\u2019t \u2013 even I am not that ungrateful to ask for something more after this kind of indulgence. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, I\u2019m a big fan of your work; I have been for a very long time \u2013 including Johnny Bunko, which I still have to this day. So, you may recall ages ago \u2013 lifetimes ago \u2013 I think it was at South by Southwest, actually, which is timely since I now live in Austin, Texas \u2013 you inscribed, you signed a copy of that book for me, which I still have. I\u2019ve carried it with me \u2013 Daniel Pink: I remember where we were sitting. I do. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, I appreciate it, and I still have the book. And it\u2019s really been nice to reconnect and catch up a bit. Daniel Pink: Indeed. Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s been fun \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s been fun to watch all the great thing that you\u2019re doing, and this massive audience that you\u2019ve built. And just \u2013 I\u2019ve gotten so much \u2013 my dog-eared \u2013 too bad we\u2019re not on video, but I can show my dog-eared copy of Tools of Titans, which is a great book title by the way. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Awesome. It is the only book title that came easily; it is the only one. All the other ones were agonizing, agonizing, agonizing sessions of brainstorming, and picking one of the titles among many that I felt dissatisfied with. Tools of Titans for whatever reason \u2013 thanks to the universe or whatever powers may be, or luck that may have happened upon me, but that is one that just kind of came, and I was like, \u201cHey, that\u2019s the title.\u201d And that was it. Daniel Pink: I didn\u2019t \u2013 I also didn\u2019t realize that you were in Austin. How did you end up in Austin \u2013 or why did you end up in Austin? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 I have felt a gravitational pull to Austin for a very long time. I, in fact, wanted to move here right out of college, but I didn\u2019t get the job [inaudible] [02:00:39] \u2013 made it to the final round of interviews which brought me out to Austin, really fell in love with the town. Though, the baseline of friendliness and warmth here, of neighborly feel is higher than just about any other place I\u2019ve experienced. And then, instead of getting a job here, I got a job in the Bay Area, which took me to San Jose, and Mountain View, and San Francisco for the better part of nearly 20 years \u2013 which I loved for that period of time. But, much like with books, I think that you visit places, and your experience of those places changes over time, and what attracted me to the Bay Area, I think, has morphed into something else, and \u2013 I have also morphed into someone else. And it felt like a good time for me to experiment with a new location. Also, I found myself in the very \u2013 almost inescapable conversation of tech to be just drinking the Kool-Aid a little too heavily, or repeatedly, or believing my own bullshit maybe \u2013 not necessarily bullshit, but getting caught up in a lot of platitudes that are thrown around so often in Silicon Valley, to have become part of the daily vernacular And that scared me quite frankly, that I was like, \u201cWait a second, if I look back at the last five to six months, how many conversations have I had that don\u2019t include the following twelve words, or twelve expressions?\u201d I was like, \u201cWow, I can actually count them on both hands.\u201d Daniel Pink: Interesting. Interesting. Where did you grow up? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I grew up at the very end of Long Island and was born [inaudible] in The Hamptons, which is a very odd thing to be. For anyone who\u2019s seen The Affair \u2013 I have not, but I\u2019ve heard of The Affair, this TV show that is, apparently quite popular, a lot it takes place in this restaurant called the [inaudible], which is Montauk, and I used to be a busboy at the [inaudible] Daniel Pink: Oh, wow. Nice. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So Long Island is where this \u2013 this whole thing started. Daniel Pink: Weirdly, I remember from \u2013 4-Hour Workweek, I think that you described yourself as a \u201chellion\u201d. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0A little hellion. Good memory. Daniel Pink: Which is a great word, it was such a great word. But I realized I didn\u2019t have a geographic sense of where you grew up; it\u2019s interesting. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, I think the use of \u201chellion\u201d is actually in the dedication to my parents, and my mum. Daniel Pink: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. I think that\u2019s right. You know why? And one reason I remember that is that I listened to part \u2013 I got part of that book on audiobook, and I remember at the beginning \u2013 because you read that book, I\u2019m almost certain. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It was Ray Porter who has a voice that is easily mistaken for my various mannerisms that I\u2019ve developed now to be a \u2013 that was Ray Porter. He did a great job. Daniel Pink: Wow. Interesting. Okay. But I\u2019m pretty sure that \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just a great word. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It is a good word. It is a good word. Daniel Pink: I\u2019m going to try to use it in the next 24 hours. When I come up with a good \u2013 when I hear a good word, I try to drop it in the next 24 hours, just because it helps to reinforce it for me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, I\u2019m going to try to use surrogation, and I\u2019m going to try to eat more hard-boiled eggs in the next 24 hours. Daniel Pink: You\u2019re golden. Golden, man. Your life would change markedly if you start employing the principle of surrogation while eating hard-boiled eggs. Everything will \u2013 the sun would come shining up and \u2013 the sun would burst out from behind the clouds, and unicorns would scamper across your front lawn. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, my dog would love that. And Dan, this has been \u2013 this has been a lot of fun. Thank you. Daniel Pink: Thanks a lot for having me. I appreciate it. It was really interesting. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And for everybody listening, as always, you can find links to everything including Dan\u2019s social website, the new book When, and much more in the show notes, which you can find at tim.blog/podcast.

anywhere", "so, that was a book called the adventures of johnny bunko, and as you say, tim, it was written in the japanese comic format known as manga", "and, as you know, as a japanophile, in japan, manga, the comic format, is much more versatile and more widely used that it is here in the united states", "so, you have grown-ups reading comics, and they can be things about financial advice,

think it\u2019s time for manga to broaden its reach here in the united states of america.\u201d so, i wrote a book called the adventures of johnny bunko, and it\u2019s a graphic novel in manga form

decisions", "it gave me some, actually, really good advice on how to make better decisions", "but i, basically, went law school without knowing what lawyers did, or even what law school was", "it was just something i did because that\u2019s what i was supposed to do; i found i didn\u2019t really like it very much", "and once i found out what lawyers actually did \u2013 and god bless the lawyers listening to this \u2013 but once i found what lawyers actually did, i was like, \u201coh, you hire somebody else to do to that.\u201d it\u2019s like \u2013 i mean, it\u2019s like it takes skill to plunge a toilet, or that kind of thing, or mow a gigantic backyard \u2013 i mean, it takes skill to do that", "it just that, you know what", "it\u2019s really not my thing", "and so, so what i\u2019d rather do is do something else and then pay someone else to do that kind of dirty work", "and yet, i found myself stuck in because i was risk-averse \u2013 i did leave for a little while", "actually, i dropped out for a little while, but i came back", "and so i went through law \u2013 i went through law school, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 accumulated massive, massive, massive, massive student loans", "but i was very fortunate in two dimensions in my law school trajectory", "one was that my school had a very ahead-of-its-time loan payback program, key to salary", "so, if you made less than a certain amount, they would offer assistance in repaying your student loans", "and that gave people much more \u2013 nobody \u2013 not many people took it \u2013 but that gave you, theoretically, more career flexibility if you decided not to practice law", "the other thing is that i met my wife in law school", "so, it\u2019s a decision that ended up having a profound positive effect on my life", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did it help you learn to make better decisions", "going to law school", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right", "you said that \u2013 well, here\u2019s the thing \u2013 okay, here\u2019s what it is", "here\u2019s the thing", "so, there\u2019s this principle in social science, it has a fancy name, but it is something that we all do \u2013 and something that we should do \u2013 it\u2019s the principle of surrogation", "okay", "how do you make decisions", "you use the principle of surrogation", "and surrogation basically means, find someone like you who made this decision, and see what happened to him or her", "that is, find out what it\u2019s really like", "again, this is a totally fancified way of something that is very commonsensical", "should i go to this restaurant", "well, let me check the yelp reviews of 47 other people who have gone to this restaurant", "and what i did \u2013 and it\u2019s amazing to me, tim, when i think about this, and it\u2019s advice that i give to my own kids as well", "i went to law school literally having never spent a day \u2013 not a day, ten minutes \u2013 talking to a lawyer about what he does", "i\u2019m not \u2013 i mean, i\u2019m embarrassed to say that, but that\u2019s absolutely the case", "i went to law school having never sat in on a law school class", "i mean, it\u2019s unbelievable to me in retrospect", "and so, had i done those kinds of things, i might have approached it more skeptically", "but i didn\u2019t do those things, and so \u2013 and because that ended up being an incredibly expensive decision \u2013 even though it led to some \u2013 it basically \u2013 i mean, it led to the most positive thing in my life which is my wife \u2013 even though it led to something positive, it was a terrible decision", "so, now, i\u2019m sort of a surrogation \u2013 a surrogation idealogue, like i believe in surrogation for everything", "largely because i got bitten by that bad decision", "tim ferriss:\u00a0can you give us an example of at some fork in the road or some perspective decision where you\u2019ve used surrogation \u2013 or where you\u2019re planning on using it", "oh, sure", "okay", "so, i\u2019ll give you an example of it", "so, again, we\u2019re not talking rocket science here, we\u2019re talking like, basically, \u201chey, act like a reasonably intelligent grown-up,\u201d is basically what i\u2019m doing here", "but let\u2019s go back to the \u2013 let\u2019s go back to the japan thing", "so, i got a fellowship to go to japan, and i went with my wife and our kids as i mentioned", "but before i did that, i talked to six different people who had the same fellowship \u2013 before i accepted \u2013 six different people who have the same fellowship, what it was like for their kids, what the work was like, what the living was like, before i made the decision", "now, again, that is not a monumental, intellectual breakthrough", "but it\u2019s something that i didn\u2019t do when i was much younger", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, it\u2019s best practice that can often get skipped, right", "whether that\u2019s something like this or something that should be very straightforward, if you look at, say, [inaudible] [00:10:11] day\u2019s work and the checklist manifesto, and checking the various things to avoid bacterial line infections in a hospital, right", "it\u2019s very straightforward, but if you neglect it, over time, bad things are going to happen", "yeah, yeah", "but it\u2019s also the \u2013 i think that as \u2013 as i\u2019ve gotten older, and gotten more experience, i\u2019ve actually become much more aware of the importance of intellectual humility", "and when i think of when i was younger, i feel, \u201cwell, i know what law school was like.\u201d \u201chow do you know?\u201d \u201cwell, i just know", "because i thought about it, so i know", "i know what lawyers do, because i met somebody who was a lawyer, and i know what lawyers \u2013\u201d and so there\u2019s a degree of arrogance in that; i was thinking that you know something when you actually don\u2019t", "and so,\u00a0 if you approach all kinds of decisions with a degree of intellectual humility and ask yourself, \u201cwhat don\u2019t i know about this", "where are my blind spots?\u201d, then i think you\u2019ll end up making better decisions", "tim ferriss:\u00a0definitely", "speaking of blind spots, i promised i would segue into politics, and that is somewhere i have very, very little confidence in any of my knowledge or expertise", "how did you \u2013 so i was looking at what i believe to be one of your first articles that really \u2013 i\u2019m not going to say \u201cput you on the map\u201d, that\u2019s too much of an overstatement \u2013 but the free agent nation article on fast company which was at the end of 199 \u2013 ", "yeah", "20 years ago", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, 1997", "and in the bio \u2013 or the byline, rather \u2013 of that article says, \u201cuntil recently, chief speechwriter to vice president al gore", "so, where did you go from law school \u2013 or dropping out of law school, for a period of time \u2013 to speechwriting for then-vice president al gore", "well, when i graduated from law school, i was, actually, very keenly interested in politics; it was probably my deepest interest at the time", "and i said, \u201cyou know what", "i\u2019m going to go work \u2013 i\u2019m going to work in politics.\u201d and \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0why was it interesting to you at the time", "a couple of reasons", "no", "1 is that i thought it was a venue for achieving something in the world and making a contribution to the world", "the other thing is that i found the actual practice of it quite exciting and interesting in the way that sport is exciting and interesting", "so, it\u2019s was combo platter for me", "and i had been interested in it for many, many years", "and i said, \u201cokay, this is what i want to do.\u201d so, i got out of law school, and i started working on political campaigns \u2013 which, at the time, i liked, because political campaigns are totally interesting", "i mean, again, it\u2019s like a sport, in that there\u2019s a beginning and there\u2019s an end, and there is a very clear outcome", "and it\u2019s exciting, and you\u2019re making decisions on the fly, and i find political campaigns, more than other kinds of organizations and institutions, fairly meritocratic because there\u2019s so much going on, and so much crazy stuff happening that, if you can do something, you will continue to \u2013 you\u2019ll be asked to do it again", "and that\u2019s pretty much what happened to me", "and that, someone, at some point asked me to write a speech, and i did it, and it was okay", "and then they said, \u201chey, that\u2019s okay", "you want to do it again?\u201d and i did it again", "and then i did a third time", "and then, all of a sudden, that was my job", "and it ended up being something that i had a certain affinity for, and it\u2019s something that a lot of other people did not, and so just in the supply and demand of who had to do what, that\u2019s what i ended up doing, and i enjoyed it", "i did it political campaigns, i did for a cabinet secretary, and then i ended up doing it for the \u2013 i ended up doing for the vice president", "the trouble was is that, when i had spent all these years in the belly of the beast, it\u2019s sort of like, \u201cwow, i really want to work in politics,\u201d and all of a sudden, in a pretty kind of half-assed way, i was at a pretty good gig in the belly of the beast", "i realized, \u201chey, i\u2019m not sure this is my thing", "i thought this was my thing, but i\u2019m discovering that this is not my thing, and what\u2019s even worse is that if i project out even further, and look at, say, what i\u2019m going to be like, or what i\u2019m going to be doing in ten years or 20 years, i really don\u2019t like that picture, because i see some of those people around me.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0but is there anything besides the projecting forward, looking at the people who had \u2013 been in the game, so to speak, for a longer period of time, and saying, \u201cwow, i could see myself filling their shoes, and i don\u2019t like what that looks like,\u201d was there anything else, any other indicators or moments that made you realize it wasn\u2019t for you", "there were a few things", "first of all, the amount of bs that was involved was startling to me", "i expected some, but if you do a pie chart of bs and not-bs, the bs slice was extraordinarily large \u2013 larger than you would imagine on a number of different dimensions", "and here\u2019s the thing, tim, i freaking lucked out too, in who i was working for, because my last two jobs, i worked for al gore who\u2019s a very smart guy, and a very good guy, all around", "and before that, i worked for the then labor secretary, i was a speechwriter the then labor secretary, a guy named robert reich, who\u2019s a very smart guy, and a good guy", "so, i had basically the best kind of bosses you could possibly have", "and so, that was another indicator \u2013 so i got the best bosses you could possibly have, and i still like, \u201chmm, it\u2019s not the species of the reich or gore, i don\u2019t like, it\u2019s the genies of politics that is actually bringing me down.\u201d and so \u2013 and so among the things that i didn\u2019t like \u2013 let\u2019s go back to the bs", "there was an enormous amount of \u2013 an enormous amount of time spent, basically in the air, in almost everything that was going on \u2013 within the boundaries of the law, obviously \u2013 concern for basically pandering and fundraising", "it was really quite remarkable", "the other thing is that i also felt like a lot of the other people who were good people, that they were so interested in \u2013 they were so absorbed in the mechanics of things, that they \u2013 i felt like i was losing sight over, like, what we were doing here in the first place, what did we actually \u2013 what did actually believe in that the \u2013 and there was so much short-termism, so much short-term insane kind of posturing, and, \u201coh, let\u2019s get this slight advantage over the day.\u201d and it was like, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point", "what\u2019s the point of all this?\u00a0 i\u2019m working really, really hard, and i\u2019m not sure this is \u2013 i\u2019m not sure we\u2019re actually doing that much", "and here\u2019s the scary part, it\u2019s like \u2013 that was 20 years ago", "in retrospect, those are the good old days", "i mean, you have \u2013 i mean, we were \u2013 i mean, i\u2019m old enough, i did this long enough ago, where i\u2019d be pumped when something i wrote made it onto the \u201cevening news\u201d", "i haven\u2019t watched the evening news for 19 years", "we weren\u2019t dealing with social media, the world was very, very, very partisan then, but nothing like the way it is now", "so, i remember devoting a couple of days in my office to some subpoena that was given to gore\u2019s office, or filing some document about some nonsense thing \u2013 and i\u2019m really concerned about that because i didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but it\u2019s like, \u201coh, my god, if i have an email that mentions x, y, or z, and i don\u2019t find it, and then someone else finds it, then i\u2019m going to have\u00a0 to hire a lawyer and \u2013 i didn\u2019t sign up for this garbage.\u201d so \u2013 so, i finally decided to \u2013 yeah, so, again, this thing that i thought i was deeply, deeply interested in, once i actually experienced it, i found myself far less interested in it than i would have suspected", "if you had told me that \u2013 when i left that job \u2013 if you had told me ten years earlier; \u201cyou\u2019re going to have this job, and you\u2019re going to leave it because you\u2019re tired of politics,\u201d i would have been very surprised", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if you look back at that experience, the skills you either had natively or developed, how do you prepare your speeches now", "or maybe if we take an example, of a speech that you\u2019ve given, that has received very positive feedback, or really \u2013 from your perspective \u2013 engaged the audience, how do you prepare \u2013 how do go about preparing a 30-minute, 60-minute speech", "what does that look like", "is there any example that you can give us", "yeah", "i mean it depends", "i mean, actually, that experience writing speeches was actually extraordinarily useful in going out and being a writer, and then going out and talking about what i\u2019ve written about", "i mean, it\u2019s extraordinarily useful", "i mean, if for no other reason, tim, it was \u2013 i mean, i spent a lot of time as a speechwriter, watching audiences react, seeing what worked and what didn\u2019t", "and that, i think, has completely left an imprint on me", "again, i was able \u2013 i had this before i went out on doing it myself, i spent as much time as any human being could have done watching speeches being given, but i always would watch \u2013 when any of my bosses would give a speech, i would actually watch the audience rather than my boss to see \u2013 because that\u2019s how i learned to get better at it", "\u201chey that line works", "hey, that line\u2019s a dud", "hey, they\u2019re spacing out here", "hey, this person over here looks confused", "wow, this went on too long", "wow, this could have gone a little \u2013\u201d i never had experienced it, it could have gone on longer", "but this could have \u2013 seriously, we could have cut it out there", "and so, seeing audiences react just give me \u2013 i mean it\u2019s hard to \u2013 let me think of an analogy here \u2013 okay, listen, imperfect analogy, but it\u2019s almost like i\u2019m going to go, basically walk up and down the streets of santiago, chile for a couple of years", "i\u2019m not going to do any talking, but i\u2019m going to listen to everybody else talking", "and it\u2019s like, \u201cwow, you\u2019re going to learn some spanish that way.\u201d it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 you\u2019re not going to be perfectly spanish, but you have a huge advantage of someone if you do that, and then go and say, \u201chey, i think i\u2019m going to learn how to speak spanish.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0and then it also makes me think of a very useful feature for a potential speaker, although it\u2019s probably not worth the labor for the ted organization, would be to take the camera see that\u2019s always pointed at the audience and give you the option of listening to ted talks while watching the audience respond", "that\u2019s an interesting idea; that\u2019s an interesting idea", "i mean, they do cutaways on those kinds of things, but the cutaways don\u2019t show people being bored", "that\u2019s actually more revealing than anything else", "and i\u2019ll tell you, from a speech-giver\u2019s point of view \u2013 and it\u2019s interesting you raise this, tim, because i haven\u2019t really thought a huge amount about it myself", "but one of the things that i enjoy most about giving talks is seeing the audience\u2019s reaction, and figuring out what\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t", "so, if i come up with, \u201chey, i got this killer line i just thought of; this is going to totally rule.\u201d and then i deliver it, and it\u2019s like, \u201cwoah, that bombed.\u201d and in my head, i don\u2019t feel like, \u201coh, i\u2019m so sad that it bombed.\u201d but in the back of my head, i\u2019m like, \u201cah, that bombed, that\u2019s so interesting", "i got to make a note of that, like that one bombed.\u201d and why did that one bomb", "did people not understand it", "was it obnoxious", "and so, i loved that part of \u2013 and when you give speeches, and you do something in real time with people \u2013 really, anything before an audience", "so, if you and i were talking before a live audience, we would be getting feedback on a conversation that i think would be really useful and interesting", "and when you do things that are asynchronous, as we\u2019re doing now, or writing a book which is asynchronous, you get that feedback much later, and so the feedback is as meaningful", "and so, if i \u2013 if i write something, and someone says, \u201cyou wrote this passage here, i just don\u2019t get it.\u201d that\u2019s sort of a bummer for me, because i don\u2019t time to [inaudible] [00:22:49] it", "but if i say something before an audience, and i get a bunch of blank looks, i immediately know, \u201cwow, okay, i didn\u2019t explain that very well", "i got to back, next time around, and explain it better.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019ve so many different questions i want to dig into related to what you just said", "first is, actually, connected to something we were talking about, just before we hit record", "and that was you, having listened to the interview i did with bryan koppelman, the screenwriter, filmmaker, co-creator of the hit show billions among many other things.\u00a0 and his penchant to end recommendation for forensically studying film \u2013 watching films with a notebook in hand, and taking notes on what worked, what didn\u2019t, his responses and so on", "and you mentioned a number of different questions and cues that you might were yourself while watching, in your speechwriter days, the audience while your \u2013 [inaudible] [00:23:52] your boss is giving a talk.\u00a0 would you be writing those things down", "would you be sitting there with a notebook in hand, recording this type of thing", "what i would be \u2013 what i would often be doing would be \u2013 i would have \u2013 so, if i had \u2013 if it was a speech where there was a written text \u2013 which is not always the case", "in some cases, for lower-key \u2013 for less significant things, it would be, say, conversations and talking points, and some things like that", "but let\u2019s say for a speech that was actually delivered, that is a speech that was written out, and then delivered behind a podium, i would always have the actual physical text of the speech, and i would markup that physical text of it", "so, in some cases, because it was helpful for me in terms of just relating to my own boss \u2013 let\u2019s say that he skipped a paragraph, i\u2019m like, \u201chmm, i wonder why he skipped that paragraph,\u201d maybe ask him about that, or maybe i could even figure out why he skipped that paragraph \u2013 he didn\u2019t even bother reading the paragraph, or he skipped a line, or he ad-libbed a new version of the line", "that was, actually, very helpful for me in terms of just dealing with my boss", "because, again, what you\u2019re trying to do in writing a speech for somebody else, it that you\u2019re trying to make that person sound like the best version of him or herself", "and so, it could be that the way i phrase something didn\u2019t sound like him, but he knew what i meant, and he was able to phrase it in his own words, and that, actually, was helpful for me in terms of doing the tactical craft of my job", "so, i would have the text with me, i would say there was a joke, i would say \u2013 i mean, i basically would \u2013\u00a0 i mean like plus and minus, and say, \u201chey, that joke worked, that joke didn\u2019t work", "that line worked, that line didn\u2019t work.\u201d and one of the things that it taught me was, also, is that you don\u2019t go based on \u2013 and i\u2019m getting in the weeds here a little bit \u2013 but you don\u2019t make permanent decisions based on one reaction", "and i do that, myself, now in my own stuff", "so, if i say something and it doesn\u2019t work the first time, i don\u2019t abandon the thing; i make a note of that, and then i try it again", "because, sometimes, different audiences, different contexts, different things, it can work", "but yeah, i would do that", "and here\u2019s the thing: i don\u2019t want to make this sound like \u2013 i use the word \u201cforensic\u201d to talk about what koppelman is doing", "mine was less forensic, it was more hygienic", "to me, it\u2019s like \u2013 that\u2019s just good staff hygiene", "you know what i mean", "i wrote a speech, and this dude is delivering it, i should pay attention to how it\u2019s going.\u00a0 and if i do that \u2013 if i do that, i\u2019m going to do better next time, and he\u2019s going to do better next time", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if i look at the \u2013 my own writing, the writing that i\u2019ve done that has received the best response \u2013 just keep it broad \u2013 nine times out of ten, it\u2019s something that i have tested and honed in some speaking format, whether it\u2019s a presentation or a class, or something else", "which is part of the reason why, if i\u2019m giving a talk or doing an interview in front of a lot of audience, i always ask them to raise the house lights, because for whatever reason, a lot of venues like to really dim it down, but then you can\u2019t see the response", "so, i always ask to raise the house lights", "totally", "totally with you on that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0when you are testing out a speech, or an article, or a chapter on someone else, what types of questions \u2013 what are you looking for, or what types of questions do you ask", "you can pick any of those that you\u2019d like \u2013 but what types of questions do you ask?\u00a0okay", "yeah, yeah", "let me take your simple question and complicate it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0let\u2019s go for it", "because i actually think that speeches and written word are different things", "and so \u2013 so the way that i would convey an idea in a speech is going to be different from the way that i would convey this similar, same idea in a book", "and so, for me, like one of the most important \u2013 i have to say, it\u2019s a simple question, but \u2013 and i find myself asking it all the time to people is this following question, \u201cdoes that make sense", "does that make sense?\u201d or what i\u2019ve sometimes found, an easier way to rephrase that, is \u2013 this is actually \u2013 i think it\u2019s actually a useful writing hack is \u2013 \u201cwhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0yes, it\u2019s a great question", "so, i think that people are more likely to say, \u201cdoes that make sense?\u201d, out of politeness, and also just out of self, \u201coh, of course, that makes sense", "yeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d but, sort of, \u201cwhat about that \u2013\u201d so, i converted a little bit, \u201cwhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d when you explain an idea to somebody, or you\u2019re talking to an audience, i really think \u2013 i mean, maybe i\u2019m overestimating my own abilities \u2013 but i really think you can tell by the looks on people\u2019s faces", "there are all other kinds of markers of that too", "so, for instance \u2013 especially now, if you have slides, what are people taking pictures of", "what slides are they taking pictures of", "what things are they writing down", "so, i look at those kinds of cues in talks", "i think writing is more difficult, and i\u2019ll tell you what i do in writing, especially books, and this is a little bit insane \u2013 or it\u2019s \u2013 i mean, it\u2019s insane in the sense that it requires someone who is deeply devoted to you in a way that someone you truly love is devoted to you", "so, here\u2019s the thing about my books: i \u2013 even though i\u2019m \u2013 even though i just said speeches and written words are different, for me, i actually improve my writing by listening to it", "not because \u2013 i listen to written words different from the way i listen to speeches, if that makes any sense", "and so, when i write books \u2013 so the latest book \u2013 i mean the latest book and all the previous books \u2013 i have an office here behind my house in washington dc, it\u2019s a garage \u2013 refurbished garage", "and for \u2013 i would sit in my office \u2013 and let\u2019s talk about the latest book, just to give you idea", "so, this is a book, i don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like 280 pages, something like that", "i read every word of that book out loud to my wife, at various stages", "what\u2019s more, i read drafts \u2013 multiple drafts of chapters \u2013 out loud to my wife in this office", "but wait, there\u2019s more", "my wife read every word of this book out loud to me, including drafts", "because, for me, that\u2019s how i \u2013 that\u2019s how i process the written word", "so, for me, i can tell what works in a speech, because you have a large audience of people behind \u2013 reacting to it", "when, in terms of written words, like i \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "it\u2019s just like \u2013 you know, after all these years, i know what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not when it comes to the written word", "and i actually know what\u2019s not good, really, is what i know", "and so, i try to remove all the not-good stuff", "and the way i do that, and it\u2019s a very laborious way, is to read aloud because that helps me look at the words a different way, but also to have them read aloud to me", "now, what\u2019s amazing to this \u2013 and shows you just how incredible and awesome my wife is \u2013 is that i\u2019m the worst person on the planet to be read aloud to, because i\u2019m a complete pain in the ass when it comes to \u2013 especially if you\u2019re reading my works", "\u201coh, come on, you\u2019ve got read with more expression than that.\u201d \u201coh, come on", "no, the emphasis is on that word", "no.\u201d and my saintly wife has done this for several books now", "tim ferriss:\u00a0wow, she\u2019s a keeper", "i\u2019ve \u2013 i\u2019ve only \u2013 i suspect this is more common than either of us might expect, but john mcphee,\u00a0 the non-fiction writer, also writes \u2013 i think h still writes for the new yorker", "fascinating guy, but i took a seminar with him in undergrad, and he also explained how he reads all of his work", "i believe he reads not only his feature works but his articles out loud to his wife", "really", "i actually did not know that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "so, this is \u2013 yeah", "well, i\u2019m pretty good company, because i \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0you\u2019re in good company", "i started reading john mcphee when i was like a \u2013 like a pretty \u2013 like a young teenager", "and one of the best mcphee books i\u2019ve read was a book \u2013 you might have read it \u2013 called levels of the game tim ferriss:\u00a0you know, it\u2019s so good", "it\u2019s so, so good", "i loved that book", "i read it again \u2013 i actually read it again about two years ago", "but i read it as a kid; i got it out the library, i spent a lot time in libraries when i was a kid, and i don\u2019t know how, some librarian or somebody told me about it", "because there was a \u2013 because he has that famous book about bill bradley a sense of where you are, so i read that because i was a basketball fan", "and it\u2019s like \u2013 i was also a tennis fan, and it\u2019s like, \u201coh, you read about tennis too?\u201d and i read that book, and i didn\u2019t \u2013 at the time, i guess i was saying, \u201cwow, you can actually write about sports in a way that\u2019s, kind of, more interesting than just sports.\u201d that\u2019s a remarkable book \u2013 i mean, i can explain it", "so, it\u2019s a story about a match between \u2013 a single tennis match between arthur ashe \u2013 who, then, was very young, just out of richmond \u2013 and a guy named clark graebner who was from a wealthier \u2013 white guy, wealthier family in \u2013 i think it was suburban cleveland", "and what he does is he basically describes the match, but throughout he pulls back and tells each of their stories of how they actually got to the court that day; i think it was a us open \u2013 a us open match", "and so, he actually describes them playing a point, and then he pulls back and talks about how arthur ashe got there, and he pulls back and talks about clark graebner go there", "and he does it with such elegance and such precision, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a joy to behold", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s truly spectacular", "for those who haven\u2019t read mcphee, you should \u2013 if not for any other reason, that he can take any subject matter you can imagine, and make a riveting book about said subject \u2013 it could be oranges, plymouth rocks, cars, hand-carved canoes, geology", "yeah", "oranges book, i read that when i was a kid too", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it just \u2013 you name the topic, and he can turn it into a page-turner", "but levels of the game is just spectacular", "and one thing that mcphee is a very, very good at is \u2013 and i think this is also shared territory with you \u2013 is asking questions", "given the nature of his writing, a very significant portion of his time is spent interviewing", "and, \u201cwhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d is a really powerful tweak on the, maybe, alternative that you mentioned, which is, \u201cdoes this make sense?\u201d or \u201cdoes this make sense or not?\u201d and this may be digging too far into the weeds, but i was really fascinated to read about an approach that you\u2019ve detailed in one of your books called motivational interviewing", "and i hadn\u2019t heard of this before, but the example that stuck out to me \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to give this exact example \u2013 was asking a student who is, seemingly struggling with algebra, a certain question instead of others", "i don\u2019t want to butcher it, but i can certainly, also \u2013 i have in front of me, so i can pull it up if need be", "but can you explain for people what motivational interviewing is, and maybe give an example", "yeah", "so, this is actually a \u2013 it\u2019s a therapeutic technique that, i think, has a wider application", "and i\u2019ve heard about it from a fellow named mike pantalon, who\u2019s at yale school of medicine who used it in, i think, addiction treatment", "and it\u2019s basically like this: so, let\u2019s say that \u2013 let\u2019s say that you have \u2013 let me think of a good example here, of something that somebody, typically, isn\u2019t that keen to do", "okay, let\u2019s go to algebra, let\u2019s say you have \u2013 let\u2019s say you\u2019re a parent and you have kid who\u2019s in eighth grade, and he is \u2013 has an algebra test and doesn\u2019t want to study for that algebra test \u2013 isn\u2019t into it, doesn\u2019t want to do it", "and so, a typical reaction from parents, from anybody in authority figure is, \u201cwhat the hell is wrong \u2013?\u201d, start saying \u2013 just sort of demanding, start demanding compliance", "and motivational interviewing is almost the reverse of that", "so, it basically \u2013 so, let\u2019s say you have a kid named bob", "you could say \u201chey, bob, i see you\u2019re not studying for your algebra test", "let me ask you a question \u2013 i see you have an algebra test tomorrow, on a scale of 1 to 10, how ready are you to study for your algebra test", "how are ready are you to start studying for your algebra test", "how much do you want to start studying for your algebra test?\u201d and bob is totally unmotivated by it; bob might say, \u201ci\u2019m a 3, a 3 out of 10.\u201d now, again, our reaction as bosses, as parents, as people, and figures of authority is to say, \u201cwhat do you mean you\u2019re a 3", "you should be a 9.\u201d but instead, you\u2019re more chilled than that, and you say, \u201cokay, you\u2019re a 3", "why didn\u2019t you pick a lower number?\u201d and that always wakes people up", "so, he says, \u201ci\u2019m a\u00a0 3 out of 10 in terms of my desire to do this thing.\u201d and you say \u2013 instead of saying, \u201cmy god, you should be a 9", "what, are you crazy", "you lazy ass.\u201d, you say, \u201coh, why didn\u2019t you pick a lower numb and what\u2019s interesting about that, is that \u2013 it\u2019s what it does to bob", "it\u2019s that bob has to now say why he\u2019s not a\u00a0 2", "and so, he begins saying things like, \u201cwell, you know, if i don\u2019t study for this test, i\u2019m probably going to bomb the next test; if i don\u2019t master this material, it\u2019s going to be harder to go into later on", "if i don\u2019t do well in this test, you might hassle me.\u201d and so what happens is, is that bob begins articulating his own autonomous, intrinsically motivated reasons for doing something", "and that\u2019s the key", "a and what we know \u2013 from a mountain of social sciences \u2013 is that when people have their own reasons for doing something, they\u2019re more likely to endorse the behavior, and they\u2019re more likely to carry it out", "and so, this becomes a way to surface bob\u2019s own motivation for it through questions, rather than through \u2013 rather than through dictates", "and it can be a very, very powerful technique; you can also turn it inward", "you say, \u201cwell, how ready are you, dan, to finish this chapter", "\u201coh god, i\u2019m like a 3.\u201d and you say, \u201cwell, dan, why aren\u2019t you a 2?\u201d and so, anything you can do to help people surface their own reasons for doing something makes them more likely to commit to behavior, and more likely follow through on the behavior", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that last extension is really important", "i\u2019ve been prepping this and reading the background \u2013 some of it, and it didn\u2019t even occur to me that you could apply it to yourself, and use it for journaling or something like that, to uncover \u2013 or maybe, rediscover the motivation that drove you start it in the first place, even though you lost sight of it, or it petered out, or whatever the hell it might be", "yeah, i mean, you could use it for going to \u2013 you could use it for going to the gym, to going to work out", "like, \u201chow ready are you \u2013 how excited are you about \u2013 how motivated are you to work out right now?\u201d \u201ci\u2019m a 2.\u201d \u201cwell,\u201d i say this to myself, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you a 1?\u201d \u201cwell, i know that probably i\u2019ll feel better if i work out, rather than if i don\u2019t work out", "i know that, actually, if i don\u2019t do this aerobic exercise today, i probably might not have a chance to do it tomorrow, which means i\u2019m going to feel like crap.\u201d and so, you can turn it on yourself as well", "it\u2019s all about those surfacing \u2013 one of the things that we\u2019ve done in management, and parenting, all other realms of life is that we have over \u2013 we\u2019ve overdosed on control", "and control is not an effective way to motivate people for important things, because human beings only have two responses to control: they comply or they defy", "and that\u2019s a history of human conduct basically; human being are either complying or defying with control", "and so, we bandy control as a motivator, and look for ways for people to summon their own autonomous motivation for doing things", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, we talked at the very top of this interview about johnny bunko, and how you\u2019re ahead of the voter in the sense it didn\u2019t quite catch, you might have been a bit early with the manga format", "in contrast, a whole new mind seems to really have resonated strongly, and it did catch", "so, i\u2019d love to try to deconstruct why that was the case", "and as one example, it\u2019s appealed so much to oprah winfrey that she gifted out \u2013 i would say \u2013 4500 copies to the stanford graduating class of 2008, when she did her commencement speech there", "why do you think that is", "and the subtitle, i should just mention, it\u2019s a whole new mind: why right-brainers will rule the future,\u00a0 why did this one take", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 yeah \u2013 i mean, it\u2019s hard to say", "i think a reason that it took, is that it was a fairly original idea conveyed in a way that was easy to understand, and also had the advantage of probably being more right than wrong", "so, the idea in that book is the following, that i was arguing then \u2013 i still believe it today \u2013 that the structure of our brain offers a metaphor for describing the future of work", "and all your listeners know there\u2019s been a lot of stuff written about left brain and right brain over the year \u2013 most of it is just total garbage", "but one of the \u2013 one of \u2013 what we know about our brains is that they\u2019re, actually, somewhat efficient and that over time, they\u2019ve divided up tasks", "so, the left hemisphere specializes in one set of tasks, tasks that are logical, linear, sequential, analytical", "the right hemisphere specializes in a different set of tasks, tasks that are about understanding context, about synthesis, and about simultaneous processes", "and so, that division of labor in the brain, i think, offers a very powerful metaphor for understanding what i thought was going on in the world of work \u2013 and it continues to go on in the world of work", "but, actually, to make sure i go the underlying science right, tearing a page from the tim ferriss playbook, i actually went to the national institute of health to get my own brain scan, see my own brain in action, which ended up being a profoundly disappointing experience, but that\u2019s another story for another day", "and so, basically, the idea here is this, that the abilities that used be the most valuable in the economy \u2013 characteristic of the left hemisphere, logical, linear, sequential, analytical spreadsheet sat abilities, those abilities are still necessary, they\u2019re no longer sufficient", "and it\u2019s abilities more characteristic of the right hemisphere with the brain, artistry, empathy, inventiveness, big-picture thinking, those abilities are now the first among equals", "and the reason for that is that it\u2019s a very hard-headed reason, that those kinds of abilities are easy to outsource, easy to automate, and that the left hemisphere abilities, the sat spreadsheet abilities are easy to outsource, easy to automate, and less valuable in iterating something new, in dealing with the demands for new that comes from an abundant world", "and so \u2013 actually, maybe, another reason that took, is that i basically came to a soft-hearted conclusion in a hard-headed way", "there was a very clear economic argument for that, the three a\u2019s: asia, automation, abundance", "reductive left-brain can be done cheaper overseas", "the other \u201ca\u201d, automation, it can be done faster by computers and now, smart machines", "and then, finally, abundance, that our material needs have been satisfied and over satisfied, that there\u2019s a premium now in coming up with something utterly new, and giving the world something it didn\u2019t know it was missing, which is very much of an artistic ability", "and so, that\u2019s the argument in that took", "and it\u2019s an argument, i think, that people resonated to, because they were seeing inklings in their own life, and they needed a way to describe it, categorize it, put words on it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, it seems like history has proven your prediction or description very accurate at this point, for sure", "and it also would \u2013 it also occurs to me that this is another place, manga aside, where you and kevin kelly, the founding editor of wired magazine are very much on the same page", "you mentioned something in passing though, that i can\u2019t let go because i have to hear the separate story: why was your brain scan disappointing", "because it \u2013 i look at my brain, i was thinking my brain would be special, so i\u2019m kind of \u2013 it looked like any other brain i\u2019d seen \u2013 like i couldn\u2019t pick my own brain out of a lineup", "so, that\u2019s what it was", "i mean, it sort of \u2013 i shouldn\u2019t say disappointing", "it was \u2013 it\u2019s humbling, like the idea that here\u2019s my \u2013 i got this brain in my head, alright, and leaving aside the thorny issue of where does the brain and the mind begin or vice versa, my brain is largely responsible for who i am, and yet when i see a picture of it, it\u2019s completely unremarkable and looks like every other brain that\u2019s been scanned at that", "there\u2019s something weird and humbling about that", "disappointing too", "i don\u2019t know, i was expecting my brain would be cooler or something like that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0looking back at all of your books, do you find any commonalities or patterns \u2013 and we can also forge all sort of spurious correlations \u2013 but looking at the books that seemed to have struck a nerve, and those that, for whatever reason didn\u2019t perform up to your hopes", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, i think that when it comes to the actual performance of things, like how well a book does, that\u2019s something that\u2019s not fully \u2013 i mean, you know this \u2013 anybody knows this, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s fully in our control", "and i\u2019m actually \u2013 i\u2019m actually more or less okay on that", "i mean, it\u2019s disappointing when something doesn\u2019t do as well you want, but, to me, my criteria \u2013 my criterion is, \u201cdid i write the best book i possibly could write?\u201d and once you put it out there, there are so many other variables; you just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to take, or whether it\u2019s not going to take", "so, i mean, i wrote a book \u2013 my very first book was a book called free agent nation", "that was not a monumental \u2013 that did okay, but it was not a monumental hit", "it should have been, because i think i was right, but for whatever reason, i think it came out \u2013 like i think it just came out the wrong time \u2013 it should have come out slightly earlier", "and so \u2013 so, on that \u2013 so, to me, how well a book does, there\u2019s so much randomness on that, i\u2019m not \u2013 i try not to lose any sleep over it", "in terms of actual \u2013 is there a true line among all the books", "that\u2019s an interesting question, and i can say from the creation point of view, there\u2019s absolutely not a true line", "there is no intentional true line through these kinds of books, it\u2019s not as if i have mapped out somewhere on a whiteboard here in pink inc", "world headquarters in washington dc, this, like grand scheme to create the pink [inaudible]\u00a0 in a certain fashion, in a certain timetable with certain things covered like that", "far from it, i just go from one thing to another \u2013 i just like, figure out, what am i going to do next", "and as you know, tim, writing a book is so difficult, it\u2019s so hard, it\u2019s so time-consuming, that if you\u2019re not in love with the idea, if you don\u2019t love working on it, you\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to be miserable for you", "so, i just pick the next topic based on what i\u2019m really interested in, and what i want to spend a couple of years \u2013 a few years working on", "so, i think it\u2019s possible that people can detect a true line \u2013 that readers can detect a true line \u2013 maybe they\u2019re seeing something that i\u2019m not", "but if there\u2019s a true line, it\u2019s visible only retrospectively, it\u2019s not something that was intentional", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what was \u2013 speaking of difficulty and writing process, what if there is a \u2013 if you had to pick one, what has been the most difficult book for you to write and why", "i think it was this \u2013 i think it was the last one, the last book that i wrote", "believe it or not, you would think that it would get easier over time, but it didn\u2019t", "so, this last book, when\u00a0 about the science of timing, that was the most difficult book to write, partly because i went into that book with \u2013 so i started writing whole new mind having done some research and saying, \u201chey, i think there\u2019s something going on here, like i think we\u2019re moving to this world.\u201d and, sort of, i had a theory of the case", "with drive, i had a book about motivation, i had looked at a lot of the research in motivation, i said, \u201cwoah, wait a second", "people are missing like a huge story here.\u201d with when, i went in totally with questions rather than with any kind of theory of the case", "i basically said, \u201chey, i\u2019m making all making all kind of timely decisions in my own life", "i\u2019m making them in a totally half-arsed way", "i\u2019d like to make them in a better way, could somebody please give me some guidance?\u201d and i started looking around for guidance, and it didn\u2019t exist", "and then i started looking at the research, and i realized that across all these domains of research, literally dozens and dozens, from the hard sciences, the molecular biology, to endocrinology, to the social sciences of economics and social psychology, to many, many domains, these scholars are asking very, very similar questions", "what\u2019s the effect of time of day on what we do, and how we do it", "how do beginning affect us", "how do midpoints affect us", "how do endings affect us", "and so, i went in saying, \u201cwow, how do i make better timing decisions myself?\u201d, but i didn\u2019t have a theory of the case", "and so the volume of research for this one was so monumental, there are so many studies out there, and there were so many different \u2013 in so many different fields, and field that \u2013 like molecular biology is not a subject that is at my fingertips, alright", "i had a \u2013 i spent so much time \u2013 i basically would read those papers, i would read them through, and i would write down all the words that i didn\u2019t know the meaning of", "and then i would look up those words, and then i would read it again, and i would read it a third time", "and so, very painstaking", "and then also because i didn\u2019t have a theory of the case, i just had questions rather than even a kind of skeleton or a shape of what i wanted to write, i had to figure that out", "so, i probably did \u2013 i don\u2019t know \u2013 17, 18 different outlines of that boo, so that was \u2013 you would think it would get easier, but it actually got \u2013 it would actually get harder", "ee tim ferriss:\u00a0eighteen outlines", "what\u2019s such an outline look like", "how long is it", "what format, and \u2013", "oh, when i say an \u201coutline,\u201d it\u2019s relatively short", "just like one or two pages, nothing too comprehensive", "i guess outline is \u2013 outline is \u2013 well, it\u2019s partly the right word, because i\u2019m a firm believer when it comes to speeches and when it comes to books", "i\u2019m a believer in structure and shape", "i think that those are what make some things work, and \u2013 i think it\u2019s through television shows, i think it\u2019s through podcasts, i think that structure and shape are very important", "no, so here\u2019s the thing, tim, i think your podcasts they don\u2019t necessarily have a structure, but they have a shape", "there\u2019s no question they have a shape, alright", "and so, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a difference between \u2013 you can have sculptures, beautiful sculptures that have right angles, and you can have other beautiful sculptures \u2013 like a henry moore sculpture that has no right angles at all, but it has a distinct, and memorable, and identifiable shape", "but i\u2019m a big believer in structure and shape", "and so, what i\u2019m doing there is that it\u2019s basically just my search for, \u201chow do you organize the ideas, and what\u2019s the shape or the structure of the final product going to be", "because once i see the shape, i can a lot better work", "but for this other book \u2013 it\u2019s like i\u2019m reading through 700 studies on all these kinds of stuff, and i\u2019m like, \u201cgood god, how do i even make sense of this", "what do i put where?\u201d i started thinking about organizing it, do i organize this book about timing", "do i organize basically the way that we organize time", "so, do i write about the hour, the day, the week, the month, they year, the lifetime", "and that\u2019s a really bad way to do it", "but i ended up \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0why is that bad", "how did you decide that was a bad approach", "because \u2013 for a couple of reasons", "no", "1, the material didn\u2019t organize itself cleanly in that way", "and no", "2, that struck me more as a \u2013 like a handbook, like a farmer\u2019s almanac, rather than an intelligent book of science journalism with takeaways", "and more important, that\u2019s not a book i would want to read", "and so, i abandoned that", "but did i really abandon it", "because i actually ended up writing a whole chapter in this book, about the day", "so, i ended up cleaving off some of that, and keeping it for other things", "and so, it took me a long time to \u2013 it took me a long time to find the shape", "and the way i found the shape, is i basically write it down on either what i called big-ass stickies, these giant posted notes, or on a whiteboard that i have in my office", "but i went through many, many, many iterations", "and on that, i have a somewhat social view of that, and that what i\u2019ll do is i\u2019ll run it past people to see what they think", "and say, \u201chey, what do you think if i organized the book that way, does that make any sense?\u201d, or, \u201cwhat about that doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d or, what am i missing here", "what\u2019s the weak spot there", "but it took me a lot of time to \u2013 it took me a long time to find the shape of this book", "that, coupled with the fact that the amount of research was so massive, it was actually \u2013 it was actually the hardest book i\u2019ve had to write", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you were doing the research as you were writing the book, in effect, it sounds like", "because you\u2019re coming into it with questions, but then you\u2019re having to digest all of the information that might lead, or might not lead to answers while you\u2019re writing it", "exactly", "tim ferriss:\u00a0very, very hard", "exactly, you\u2019re so right about that; that\u2019s hard to do too", "and a lot people \u2013 i mean, you know, as a writer, it\u2019s messier than that", "there\u2019s this notion that, \u201ci\u2019m going to my research", "and then, when my research is done, i\u2019m going to do my writing.\u201d\u00a0 alright", "and so, it \u2013 it never works that way", "but when you have more questions, and you have \u2013 when you don\u2019t know the shape yet, and you still have a lot of questions, what happens is, \u201ci\u2019m going to do the research", "now, i\u2019m going to try to write down something about it.\u201d crap", "\u201cyou know what", "now, that i write it, i realize i\u2019m missing the whole thing here, and i\u2019ve got to do more research", "so let me go back and do that.\u201d so, it\u2019s less of this kind of happy march \u2013 happy jump from here\u2019s, \u201ci\u2019m going to go from this lilypad to that lilypad, and happily jump from each one to another like a delighted frog", "tim ferriss:\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of task switching, that\u2019s exactly why the four-hour [inaudible] [00:56:22] for me, it was also, by far, the most difficult book, among other reasons to write", "it\u2019s that i came into it intending to try all of these experiments, ask all these questions, and write the book somewhat chronologically as i\u2019m getting answers, and that was a very punishing way to approach things", "but to look at the content, so going past the structure and looking at the content and findings of when, i was looking at an npr interview you did, and teasing out some potential ways that i could apply the content from this book into my own life", "and i\u2019m going to read a quote \u2013 you can feel free to correct it \u2013 but this is what i have as one very clear example, and basically, i\u2019m going to ask you what types of decisions have changed for you, or easy ways that people can think about making changes related timing", "so, here\u2019s one \u2013 and i\u2019m going to truncate it a little bit, \u201cin a lot of this research in big data, you see systemically poor performance in healthcare settings in the afternoon", "example, the incidence of handwashing inside of hospitals dramatically drops in the afternoon.\u201d and that seems like a bad thing to me \u2013 that\u2019s my voice, not yours", "\u201cyou look at colonoscopies, endoscopies, find half as many [inaudible] in colonoscopies in afternoon exams versus morning exams even with the same population", "doctors are more likely to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics in the afternoon compared to the morning.\u201d and this seems \u2013 this is very, very actionable, right", "if we are to trust the data, if the patterns, if the correlations hold, then you are certainly better off with same if you want to risk-mitigate \u2013 i\u2019m not sure that was english \u2013 risk-mitigate, i think i swapped the first two letter, that has a fancy psychological term", "it\u2019s called a tip of the slongue", "tim ferriss:\u00a0exactly", "and you \u2013 you might come back to your undergrad linguistics \u2013 but what are other examples related to the when, the timing that people might be able to implement", "oh my gosh", "oh my gosh", "there\u2019s so much stuff", "i mean, the good news about that is that when i did, finally, wrestle the research to the ground, and figured how to structure it, it yielded so many great, great takeaways for readers", "so, take a step back, what we know from a mountain of research \u2013 it took a while to figure this out \u2013 was we tend to move through the day in three stages: a peak, a trough, a recovery", "peak, trough, recovery", "now, most of us move through the day in that order, people who are night owls, people who have an evening chronotype, they move through the day in the reverse order: recovery, trough, peak", "but what we know is that we know few things about human performance over the course of the day", "the most important thing \u2013 and this \u2013 i wish somebody has told me this before i was 50, rather than once i was 50 \u2013 is that our cognitive abilities do not remain the same throughout the day; our cognitive abilities change during the day, and they can change in some dramatic ways, and they can change \u2013 they change in predictable ways", "but how we perform depends on what we\u2019re doing, alright", "so, what we know about the peak \u2013 which, again, for most of us, is the morning; for night owls it\u2019s later in the day \u2013 what we know about the peak is that the peak is when we are most vigilant", "and what does \u201cvigilance\u201d mean", "vigilance means we\u2019re able to bat away distractions", "and so, when we\u2019re vigilant, and can bat away distractions, that makes it the best time of analytic work, work that requires heads-down focus \u2013 writing a report, analyzing data, that kind of work", "there\u2019s no \u2013 piles of research tell us that we should be doing our analytic work during the peak", "the trough, that\u2019s the early afternoon, and \u2013 early to mid-afternoon, as you mentioned from the data on healthcare", "a lot of bad stuff happens then", "i mean, you have standardized test scores for students go down in the afternoon, you have \u2013 if you look at auto accidents, once you control for cars on the road \u2013 obviously, there are going to be more accidents when there are more cars on the road \u2013 but once you control for that, the most dangerous time to drive is 4 to 6 am, the second most dangerous time is 2 to 4 pm", "during that midday trough, we should be doing more of our administrative work, we should be answering our routine emails, we should \u2013 i mean, you\u2019ve talked in the past, tim, about batching \u2013 we should be batching our routine emails and answering them during the trough", "we should be filling out our qps reports; we should be filling out our expense reports \u2013 whatever", "that kind of stuff that we have to do during the course of a day, that doesn\u2019t require a lot of major cognitive powers", "now, the recovery period \u2013 again, because this peak, trough, recovery is a pattern of mood, that also is a pattern of performance \u2013 the recovery period is actually really, really interesting", "during the recovery period, we have elevated moods, our mood is better than during the trough, but we\u2019re less vigilant than during the peak", "and so, it\u2019s really important to think about that combo platter here \u2013 that is you have higher mood but less vigilance", "that makes it a good time for things like brainstorming, for things like insight work, where if you\u2019re too locked down and focused, you\u2019re not going to be that creative", "and so, that degree of looseness, coupled with the elevated mood makes that recovery stage better for what are called insight problems, brainstorming, things that require iteration", "and so, what we see is that if we recognize that our cognitive abilities don\u2019t say the same over the course of a day, that they change in predictable ways, and that what we do \u2013 that when we do something, it depends on what we\u2019re doing \u2013 we should be moving our analytic work to the peak, our administrative work to the trough, and out insight and creative work to the recovery", "and it\u2019s that simple", "and what the research tells us, also, is this", "i mean, it\u2019s that time of day, explains about 20 percent of the variance in how people perform on cognitive tasks", "so, if you think about that \u2013 that\u2019s a big deal", "like we can explain the variance \u2013 like if we have two people, maria and sally \u2013 and they perform differently in cognitive tasks, how do we explain that, alright", "we say, how do we explain that variance in how people perform, maria, sally, and 18,000 other people perform on cognitive tasks, we say, \u201coh, some people are smarter than other people; some people are more conscientious than other people, some people have more social advantage than other people.\u201d but what the research is telling us is that 20 percent of that variance is time of day", "and so, what we should be doing is \u2013 and what we\u2019re not doing \u2013 is we should be making our \u201cwhen?\u201d decisions in a strategic way, rather than in the lazy, haphazard way with which we tend to make our when", "decisions", "and so \u2013 and you see this most glaringly \u2013 and this is my rant of the year \u2013 you see this most glaringly with meetings in organizations", "when we schedule meetings in organizations, the only criterion we use is availability", "that\u2019s it", "who\u2019s available", "we don\u2019t say, what kind of meeting is this", "is this a meeting where people have to be analytical", "what kind of meeting is this", "is this about travel voucher policies", "what kind of meeting is this", "are we brainstorming", "who\u2019s going to be there", "are they going to be morning people", "are they going to be intermediate people, are they going to evening people", "we don\u2019t even ask those questions", "we just say, \u201cwho\u2019s available?\u201d and it\u2019s causing \u2013 it\u2019s one of the easiest things, organizationally, to fix, and it\u2019s something that \u2013 at the unit of one, individuals can be lot more systematic and intentional about moving the right work into the right time slots", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what time of day do you generally wake up \u2013 personally", "i wake up a little after seven", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and what do the first two hours of your day look like", "do you have any particular routines", "can you walk us through what that might look like", "i don\u2019t have the detailed routines that you have \u2013 that you\u2019ve written about that you, actually, have experimented with, and thing like adrenaline, and meditation, or anything like that", "here\u2019s what i do: i wake up, alright", "i take a shower; a shower helps me wake up, so i take a shower", "i go downstairs, and i feel better if i see a member of my family", "so, whoever happens to be awake \u2013 and i have two kids in college now, so i don\u2019t see them, but i have another kid who\u2019s still around, so i see him, i see my wife, and i like to have some protein for breakfast \u2013 that\u2019s a ritual and caffeine \u2013 protein and caffeine is my preferred breakfast", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what\u2019s your go-to protein", "you know what", "i \u2013 i probably eat more hard-boiled eggs than almost any other person in america", "i am keeping the hard-boiled egg industry in business \u2013 i\u2019m single-handedly responsible for the advent of hard-boiled eggs for sale in individually-wrapped packages in airports", "i really think so", "tim ferriss:\u00a0because once they \u2013 once they introduced that, i bought them all, and they\u2019re go, \u201coh my god, there\u2019s such demand for these hard-boiled eggs.\u201d so i was just \u2013 so i was actually saying to my wife \u2013 i eat so many eggs it\u2019s ridiculous", "so, i don\u2019t have a cholesterol problem, fortunately", "so, hard-boiled eggs or peanut butter", "and then, what i do is, when i\u2019m in my writing day \u2013 and this is, actually, something i did better having read this book \u2013 when i\u2019m on writing days, i would go to my office, which, again, is behind my house, and i would not bring my phone with me, i would not turn on my email, and i will give myself a quota", "and that quota is usually \u2013 is a word count", "so, call it 700 words; i\u2019m a fairly slow writer", "so, you have these people out there who are like, \u201ci write 3000 words a day,\u201d and it\u2019s like i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve done that", "and so \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m very, very slow", "i may be slower than you are, even", "well, here\u2019s the thing, i\u2019m slow in basically \u2013 i\u2019m basically slow in every \u2013 in every domain of my life", "i\u2019m like [inaudible] i\u2019m a slow runner, i\u2019m a slow reader, i\u2019m a slow writer \u2013 i really heavily scrutinize my [inaudible] report to see if i have some kind of, like, tortoise gene in me somewhere, that somehow, one my ancestors in latvia somehow made it with a tortoise at some point", "and so \u2013 and so, what i would do, though, is i would come in and give myself that quota and i won\u2019t do anything until i hit that number \u2013 and then i\u2019m free to do other kinds of things, and then what i\u2019ll do is, i always \u2013 i\u2019ll have lunch, and then i will \u2013 i like to do \u2013 i have done a good job \u2013 especially after like this book changed the way that i organize my day", "because i do my analytic work better in the morning", "so, this book compelled to clear out my mornings to do that analytic work, which, for me, is writing", "i stuffed the administrative stuff off into the midday, and \u2013 batched emails and that kind of garbage", "and then, i like to do interviews, especially when i\u2019m interviewing \u2013 like for book interviews, i like to do those later in the day, because i\u2019m a little bit more \u2013 i like the interviews to be a little bit more free-wheeling, i\u2019m not doing \u2013 i\u2019m not an investigative reporter, i\u2019m not conducting a deposition", "i just want to hear people\u2019s stories, and what they want think about stuff", "and so \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0you\u2019re not quoting the yale law & policy review volume 8, no", "2990", "no", "no", "no", "and so, i\u2019m not \u2013 so, i want that to be a little bit more iterative", "and then, i actually end up exercising later \u2013 i end up exercising later in the day or in the early evening, i find that that works best for me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you said \u201con a writing day\u201d, when you are on book deadline, how many \u2013 what does your weekly structure tend to look like", "do you \u2013 is every day a writing day", "how do you allocate \u2013 when i\u2019m writing a book, yeah", "because i\u2019m also a momentum player, so for me, writing every day is hugely important, when i\u2019m working on a book, or working on an article", "so, i try to do that every single day \u2013 like seven days a week", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and do you have \u2013 do you have set periods of time between books", "do you decide in advance, \u201ci\u2019m going to take x period of time until i investigate another book.\u201d", "what does your macro-planning look like", "macro planning, boy", "my macro-planning is neither macro nor planned", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that \u2013 i think that needs to be on a motivational calendar somewhere", "yeah", "like for \u2013 i don\u2019t know \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0well, put another way, if that question sucks \u2013 which it might, so it\u2019s also making a bunch of assumptions \u2013 how do you decide when to take on new projects or new books \u2013 if that\u2019s a better question", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "so, i sort of go in \u2013 i sort of go in cycles", "so, i\u2019m actually heading to that cycles right now", "so, i\u2019ve spent a lot of time writing this book, and tried to make it as good a book as i can", "in terms of actually spreading the word about it, i try to do that with \u2013 excuse the cliche \u2013 not leaving anything on the sidelines, so doing everything i possibly can, and being everywhere, being strategic about it all, trying new stuff, trying cool stuff, trying to get some momentum behind the book", "and then when, sort of, white-hot center dissipates, and the book, we hope, has some momentum of it\u2019s own, then i\u2019ll go back and figure out the next project \u2013 whatever that project might be", "and the way i do that is \u2013 i know this would shock you, tim, in slow, laborious way \u2013 so what i do is, i have a \u2013 i\u2019m a sort of a \u2013 i use \u2013 i\u2019ll give you my mechanisms here", "so, i use \u2013 believe it or not, i use a lot of paper folders, and i have a labeler", "i use paper folders and a labeler to label my folders, because i was like a getting-things-done guy before getting things done with school [inaudible] i met david allen in 1997, and i bought a labeler shortly after that \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0i was going to ask if he\u2019s sending you your 5 percent royalties for the brainpower \u2013 you\u2019re like the guy who invented rollerblades or the [inaudible] 40 years before they became cool", "oh, no", "i\u2019m a dtb devotee \u2013 i\u2019m not hardcore, i\u2019m not orthodox", "but i\u2019m not \u2013 i\u2019m not reform either; i\u2019m sort of like in the middle", "and so, anyway, i have these paper files with labels, and so when i read stuff or make notes to myself, i throw stuff in those files", "i use evernote and i also use dropbox, and i just throw ideas in there", "and what i do is, every six months or so, i go through those ideas of like, \u201chey, this would be a cool television show to do; hey, this would be a cool article to write, hey this would be a cool book to write.\u201d and as i look at those ideas, maybe revisiting them every six months or so, i realize that most of them are just godawful ideas", "one of my beliefs about the human brain is that \u2013 or creativity \u2013 is that in order to have good ideas, you have to have a lot of ideas", "and so, i have a lot of bad ideas, which, i think is the only way for me to surface any decent ideas", "so, i\u2019ll revisit those ideas, and then when it comes \u2013 and i\u2019ll cull", "and what often happens when i cull, is that a few ideas end up just staying there over and over again, every six-month cycle", "and then when i get to this point now, i would go back to all of those files and look more carefully, and say, \u201chey, i sort of have, in my mind\u2019s eye right now, three possible projects.\u201d and so, i\u2019ll \u2013 then i\u2019ll more heavily vet those projects, read a lot more, talk to people, bounce ideas off of the people, and \u2013 and i like bouncing ideas off people, about [inaudible] in a moment", "and then when it comes time to write a book, i will actually write a book proposal \u2013 even if i have the deal already done", "so, if i have, like a two-book deal, like i have to write another book, but i\u2019ll still write a proposal for this next book \u2013 maybe a 40-page proposal, which allows me to figure out, is it there or there, is this something i really want to work on", "i think a lot of things sound really good when you\u2019re just shooting the breeze; they sound less good if you have to say, \u201ccan i explain this \u2013 can i explain this idea, who\u2019s going to buy it, why it\u2019s cool, why it\u2019s original, why no one else is doing it, can i explain that in a coherent written document?\u201d that\u2019s a tougher order", "and so, not everything lends itself to that", "and i will bounce ideas off people", "and so, i have a \u2013 actually, it\u2019s funny you mentioned kevin at the beginning of the show", "i have this one idea where i went out, and i went to \u2013 i made the pilgrimage to \u2013 what do you call this town \u2013 pacifica, and made the pilgrimage to kevin\u2019s house and said, \u201ci got an idea i want to run past you for a book.\u201d and kevin was one of the people who said, \u201cthat\u2019s not a very good idea.\u201d and, unfortunately, he was not the only one who said that", "and \u2013 d tim ferriss:\u00a0or fortunately, depending on how you look at it", "yeah, actually, fortunately \u2013 you\u2019re right", "fortunately, he was not the only one who said that", "so, i abandoned \u2013 i actually ended up abandoning that idea, in part, because he was another brick in the wall of people saying, \u201cno, no, no.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0let\u2019s pause there for a quick second", "do you mind sharing \u2013 i don\u2019t think kevin would care at all \u2013 what he or other people made as arguments, against you pursuing this idea", "and you can tell us what the idea was or you can blur that", "yeah, i\u2019m going to be skittish about the idea, but let\u2019s just say it has to with morality; i wanted to write a book dealing with morality", "and kevin, who is a person of religious faith who is extraordinarily well-read \u2013 and among people who are very well-read and very intelligent, i think there is a dearth of people who have strong religious faith", "it\u2019s just not an observation, it\u2019s not like a \u2013 judgment, one way or the other", "and so i thought he was just an especially good person to run this idea past", "and \u2013 i guess he and other \u2013 the theory of the case that i had, he and others had two criticisms of it \u2013 and they\u2019re not insignificant criticisms, tim", "the first criticism was, \u201cyou\u2019re wrong, alright?\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0to begin with", "yes, \u201cyou\u2019re wrong.\u201d and the second criticism was, \u201cyou\u2019re right, but it\u2019s not interesting.\u201d so \u2013 so, those are \u2013 like those are significant critiques", "so, that\u2019s how i \u2013 that\u2019s generally how i do things", "when i came up with this idea for when, it was an idea that i was kicking around there", "and one of the ways that i knew it was a good idea was two things", "no", "1 is that when i was writing the proposal \u2013 first of all, i was looking at the research, and i found myself wanting to do more research \u2013 which is always a good sign", "like, \u201choly crap, is that true", "but what about bobbity bar", "and i go look at", "\u201coh my god, bobbity bar says \u2013\u201d and so, i found myself wanting to do more research, that was one thing", "and then, when i started writing the proposal for that, it was like \u2013 for me, it doesn\u2019t happen very often \u2013 but there were portions of it that were just like butter, i could just explain it so clearly, like, \u201chere\u2019s what i\u2019m going to try to find out, and here\u2019s why it matters.\u201d and it was like \u2013 it was like that \u2013 that scene in jerry maguire where he writes all night, and \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m taking the goldfish \u2013 minus the goldfish", "and i was doing handstands against the wall and everything like that", "so \u2013 and that\u2019s sometimes a good sign", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i think it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, that lack of or an overabundance of energy, i think is undervalued", "how much the project actually gives you more to your tank", "and i think \u2013 here\u2019s the thing", "i think a lot of writers \u2013 i think a lot or people who come out as journalists \u2013 and before i started writing books, post-speechwriting, sort of as \u2013 an even through the time i was writing books, i did a lot of magazine articles, a lot of [inaudible] [01:17:31] magazine writing, which i liked \u2013 and i found a lot of journalists who would write an article, the article would do well, and they would get a book offer, and they would not properly vet it about whether they want it \u2013 because there are lot of ideas that you, maybe, want to go out on a few dates with", "but there are very few ideas that you want to go steady with, let alone marry and have kids", "and i think that books are basically you\u2019re marrying and having kids, and that\u2019s a very, very, very high bar", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there are a lot of great articles that should stay articles, and make very mediocre books", "and it\u2019d be a potential, i suppose vice versa, where you go in the opposite direction", "that\u2019s \u2013 i read \u2013 i want to say this anyway \u2013 i read one of those \u2013 it\u2019s in [inaudible] i read one of those this weekend where somebody had an article, did really well, they got a book deal, they turned it into a book", "and it\u2019s like, \u201cokay", "you know what", "this thing has so much more impact as an article, rather than as a book.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0so, i want to dig in a little bit on this tickler file that you review every six months, because one of the most frequent questions i am asked is, \u201chow do you pick projects", "how do you vet projects?\u201d and you mentioned revisiting every six months, so a few mundane questions", "within evernote, do you have any specific notebook that is tickler file or something like that", "how do you keep track of all these ideas", "i \u2013 i can actually look that up right now", "what i do is i categorize them", "so, what i have is i have a giant file called misc or just like shards", "but then i\u2019ll go through that and say, \u201cwait a second \u2013\u201d let me think of an example here", "\u201cwow, i\u2019m collecting a lot of articles about \u2013 here\u2019s the book i\u2019m not going to \u2013 like it could be interesting", "at one point, it\u2019s like, \u201csomeone should write a book about courage.\u201d what about courage", "what do we know about courage", "i\u2019m not going to do that", "if one of your listeners wants to go out and do it, god bless you; i think it could be really interesting", "so, i could go into the misc file and say \u2013 the misc notebook, i guess, that it\u2019s called \u2013 is what do we know about courage", "and i would go into this misc note, and say, \u201cwow, i got a lot of articles about courage that\u2019s going berth a separate notebook on courage,\u201d and then i organize it that way", "so, i\u2019ll have notebooks of misc, and i\u2019ll have notebooks of\u00a0 particular ideas that i have, that end up being fuller because it\u2019s like, \u201coh, this one has stuck around for a little bit longer than others.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0and you mentioned during these reviews, you might say, \u201coh, here\u2019s a cool idea for this, a cool idea for that", "oh, this could be really interesting; that could be really interesting.\u201d i would imagine, even after the second glance, and noticing that some of these ideas are coyote-ugly \u2013 you\u2019re like, \u201choly shit, how did i think that was a good idea?\u201d \u2013 even after removing the flies in the soup, you still \u2013 i like that", "i like that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you still have way \u2013 you could drown under the weight of these kinds of cool ideas; you have many things that could be interesting", "how do you then \u2013 what are the parameters, or thought processes, questions, anything that help you to get down to the three finalists", "okay, what do we \u2013 so, it would be \u2013 it\u2019s really like what would i want to spend a couple of years on", "and so, if i really thought of \u2013 like, maybe, courage would be an example", "like, i\u2019m sort of, interested in that", "but it\u2019d be like \u2013 i would rather read a good book about courage than write a book about courage \u2013 i\u2019m serious", "you know what i mean", "tim ferriss:\u00a0no, sure", "that makes perfect sense", "and it\u2019s like \u2013 and so, when you go face to face with that, and you start saying, \u201cdo i really want to do this?\u201d, then i think your soul, at some level, tells you \u201chey, this is \u2013 you\u2019re into this; you\u2019re not so into that.\u201d and so, i think that\u2019s the \u2013 i think that\u2019s the initial cut", "but it\u2019s also the one reason why i \u2013 so to get to the three finalists is actually kind of intuitive in a way \u2013 and there\u2019s no magic number to three, it could be four", "and so, this is one reason why i would write book proposals because it just forces me to \u2013 it forces me to reckon with the idea, and actually, make it real", "and there\u2019s this principle that i learned in college \u2013 at a writing course in college \u2013 and i actually ended up giving a commencement speech around this idea of \u2013 i\u2019ll spare you that for now", "but the idea was \u2013 the idea was valid, it was a revelation to me when i was \u2013 whatever \u2013 21 years old", "so, i had this \u2013 so, there\u2019s this essay-writing course, sort of higher-level essay-writing course, and i had a draft of an essay or something like that", "i went into the professor, his name is charlie warnock \u2013 i went to northwestern, and he still teaches at northwestern", "and so, charlie gave me some feedback, and i was all insistent, \u201cokay, i can fix this, i can move this part over here, maybe i\u2019ll do another piece over here, maybe i\u2019ll do another piece over here.\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cno, no, no, dan", "that\u2019s not your problem here", "the problem is that you don\u2019t know what you think", "that\u2019s why this essay sucks, this drafted essay", "you don\u2019t know what you think.\u201d he didn\u2019t say \u201csucks\u201d, but that\u2019s they this essay \u2013 that\u2019s why this essay stinks", "and then he said something to me \u2013 and i don\u2019t want to \u2013 i don\u2019t want \u2013 to sound glorified, or sound like something that is confected where a swirl of music would come up behind me in this, but what he said is that \u2013 but it\u2019s words i\u2019ve never forgotten \u2013 truly \u2013 he said, \u201csometimes, you have to write to figure it out", "sometimes, you have to write to figure it out.\u201d and that was a revelation to me, because at the time, i was in this mode, very traditional schooling mode, where \u2013 sort of like we were talking about before \u2013 you do your research, then you write; you make your outline, then you write", "and what he was saying to me is that, real writers, it\u2019s more dynamic than that; sometimes you have to write to figure it out", "and that was transformative for me", "and so, that, sort of, gave me permission to say, \u201coh, i don\u2019t know \u2013 like i can change my mind midway writing something, i can start writing without knowing fully, exactly what it is i\u2019m going to say.\u201d and to me, that\u2019s the why i write book proposals", "it\u2019s that i write to figure it out", "and a lot of times, what i figure out is, \u201cthis is not a book,\u201d or, \u201cthis is not a book i want to write.\u201d so, i had this one moment a few years ago, where \u2013 a while ago, now, actually", "ten years ago, even more \u2013 where i sent \u2013 it was like winter, like late \u2013 second half of december", "and i said to my wife, and i said, \u201chey, why don\u2019t you just take our guys, our kids \u2013 three kids \u2013 just go see your parents, just go for a week, or two weeks, or something like that", "i\u2019ve got to get a book proposal done, i\u2019m distracted", "it\u2019s like if you guys \u2013 when you guys \u2013\u201d when my family leaves like i live like an animal", "i mean, i just \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s like a racoon that got into the house", "no, truly", "i mean it is raccoon-like, in that i literally eat of out containers", "so, like my family leaves, i eat of containers, don\u2019t shave, and basically work around the clock, except for a few espn breaks", "that\u2019s basically what i do when my family is gone", "and so, i will \u2013 so i said, \u201ci\u2019m going to write a proposal for this next book.\u201d and after about seven or eight days, i called jessica at her parents\u2019 house, and i said, \u201chey, i\u2019ve got some good news and some bad news", "the good news is that you can come home now", "the bad news is that i realize this is not a book.\u201d but i was only writing to figure out that allowed me to do that", "so, i actually wrote, basically, one and a half proposals before writing the when proposal", "because i had a couple of ideas that ran \u2013 i said, \u201cokay, this is sort of interesting, but let me write to figure it out.\u201d and what i realized in \u2013 two very important things: one, it\u2019s not a book; maybe it\u2019s an article", "or two, it\u2019s not a book that i want to write", "tim ferriss:\u00a0there are a few things, raccoon behavior aside, that i want to follow up on", "the first is just to highlight something for people listening, and that is how liberating it is to think about writing as something you do not when you have your ideas ready, but something you do to figure out your ideas", "absolutely", "when did you learn that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s been, i would say, reiterated \u2013 it\u2019s something that is easy to forget, particularly if you have \u2013 or something that you\u2019ll willfully forget if you have a perfectionist streak, and a penchant for procrastination", "so, if you want to wait until all your docs are in a row so you can go to the debutante ball pristine and blow over any socks off, it\u2019s easy to forget this", "but it sounds like the cat came back the very next day but kevin kelley \u2013 just to incant his name again \u2013 he has emphasized this to me; he\u2019s such a prolific writer and emphasized this to me a number of years ago", "and i want to say it goes back, probably to mcphee, who also \u2013 much like you \u2013 obsessed with structure", "and there\u2019s a book \u2013 i think it\u2019s called draft no", "4", "yeah, it just came out", "yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it has some \u2013 some really fascinating explorations of this for those people who really want to get into weeds", "he\u2019ll also do it graphically, he\u2019ll draw out diagrams of what the structure looks like \u2013 which appeals to me", "but trying to stay on track here, i would say kevin is the most \u2013 well, you are the most recent person, but a number of years ago, kevin emphasized to me, and probably before that, mcphee", "so, it\u2019s really liberating, no", "1, to embrace that \u2013 even if you\u2019re not fully convinced it\u2019s the case", "and i also want to give a little bit of context for people who may not be familiar with book proposals", "so, book proposals, in the world of non-fiction books \u2013 i suppose i should take a further step back and say, in the world of non-fiction \u2013 so novels and fiction are totally different; in many cases, you need to finish that puppy, before anyone will tell you if your baby is ugly or not, which is \u2013 has to be terrifying", "it must be", "in non-fiction, you create a book proposal before you write your book", "and the book proposal \u2013 and feel free to interject at any point \u2013 but the book proposal is, in effect, a business plan and an overview/executive summary for your book", "and there\u2019s a lot \u2013 you find with the best book proposals, and the best startup pitches \u2013 which take the form of a deck, say powerpoint or something like that very often \u2013 they\u2019re exceptionally similar, the ingredients that make a good startup pitch and the ingredients that make a good book proposal are very similar", "but that is \u2013 and i\u2019d love to, actually, know what the structure of your book proposals look like", "i mean, i know what ingredients i would potentially include in a book proposal, but what does the table of contents look like for one of your book proposals", "yeah", "i\u2019d have to go back and look", "i think they vary a little bit, but they probably have some core design elements", "one of them is \u2013 and it\u2019s questions that i want to ask myself, which is, what is this book, what\u2019s it about", "pretty simple question", "but, i think, the more important question is, \u201cwhy does it \u2013 why does it fill a need that hasn\u2019t been filled yet?\u201d which is, basically, very similar \u2013 i use the same business plan analogy that you do on book proposals; it\u2019s sort of like a business", "like why \u2013 why is it providing \u2013 why is it filling a need that hasn\u2019t, otherwise, been met", "like, basically, if you draw a map of the marketplace, what part of the marketplace of ideas is this \u2013 does this cover that hasn\u2019t been been covered", "is it this \u2013 and i don\u2019t even mean it in \u2013 i sometimes would use the high concept pitch of, \u201cif x meets y,\u201d which i actually think is actually a very useful heuristic in figuring out ideas", "so, for instance, i pitched a whole new mind as a future\u00a0 [inaudible] seven habits of highly effective people \u2013 which i thought was a pretty good pitch", "and so \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s very common in pitching films also, just to highlight \u2013 it\u2019s really useful", "yeah, it is a \u2013 it\u2019s a heuristic", "and basically, to me, it says, if you think about a map of the territory \u2013 if you think about a map of ideas out there, why is no one over here on this part of the map", "like, \u201cshow me where, on the map, your idea is, and let\u2019s make sure that someone hasn\u2019t gotten there first", "and then tell me why someone hasn\u2019t gotten then there first", "what are they missing", "\u201d and so, in the case of when for instance, i say, \u201cwell, the reason they\u2019re missing, is that everybody thinks timing is an art, but it\u2019s actually a science.\u201d \u201coh, okay, got it", "that\u2019s why no one is there.\u201d and so, i\u2019ll talk about, what\u2019s it about, where does it fit into the marketplace of ideas, why is it original \u2013 and this is also really important: who is it for", "and the big mistake that everybody writing a book \u2013 and if there\u2019s one takeaway from this conversation for prospective writers out there, it\u2019s this: the mistake that writers make \u2013 and i think business people make, too, in their pitches \u2013 is when they say, \u201cwho is if for", "who is the audience", "who is the customer?\u201d, they always want to say \u201ceverybody.\u201d and it\u2019s not; it\u2019s never everybody", "and what i try to do, if i\u2019ve included a section of, \u201cwho is not going to buy that book?\u201d, i would have a \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0would you have a section on who isn\u2019t the customer", "right", "who is not going to buy this book", "because i think that that\u2019s the only way to think carefully about \u2013 because books are not a mass medium, and even media products, in general, are no longer mass medium \u2013 mass media; they\u2019re no longer mass \u2013 and it\u2019s like who is \u2013 and so, i\u2019ll have bullets in there saying, \u201cwho is not going to buy this book?\u201d and that helps define the audience too", "and also, i try to \u2013 and that\u2019s all \u2013 that\u2019s really all that it is", "but if you know what the book is about, where it fits into the marketplace of ideas, or why it\u2019s different from anything else that came before it, and who it\u2019s for, i think those components are really essential", "but that fourth component is \u2013 and i say this to writers too \u2013 tell me who the book is not for; tell me who\u2019s not going to buy this book", "and people have a hard time saying it, \u201coh, everybody would buy this book.\u201d somebody pitched to me an idea \u2013 somebody came to me once with an idea of a book about \u2013 somebody was asking advice, it was a book about \u2013 i hope i don\u2019t \u2013 i think the book might have gotten published, i don\u2019t want reveal the name \u2013 it was a book about the history of yoga in america \u2013 or maybe it was \u2013 yeah, i think the history of yoga", "and it\u2019s like, \u201coh, okay, that\u2019s cool", "so, i think a lot of people who do yoga might be interested in that.\u201d and she said, \u201cwell, i think people who don\u2019t do yoga are going to be interested in this.\u201d and i said, \u201cno, they\u2019re not", "like, people who don\u2019t do yoga don\u2019t care about the history of yoga, alright", "there are a shitload of people in america who do yoga, that\u2019s a pretty good audience right there", "but don\u2019t tell me every \u2013\u201d you know what i mean", "so, for me, it\u2019s like \u2013 for me, it\u2019s like my books", "it\u2019s like i know that the \u2013 like this book about the science of timing, i know that certain people in my neighborhood in northwest washington dc who read \u2013 are of a certain age, and read only literary fiction, and 700-page biographies of founding fathers \u2013 they\u2019re not going to read this book", "they\u2019re not going to read it", "they might be their neighbors, they\u2019re not going to read one of my books", "and so, i think that\u2019s really, really important about, who is the book not for", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s also an indicator of a focus and logical/rational thinking in a sense, right", "because if you\u2019re \u2013 for instance, just to diverge for a minute \u2013 but if you\u2019re in the world of investing \u2013\u00a0 where i spent a long time with early-stage startups, 17 years or so \u2013\u00a0 if they say, \u201ceveryone is my customer,\u201d there is a very real risk that if you give them x number of dollars, you give then $1 million, that they could be developing dropbox for, say, early tech adopters in the first wave and they need to get from zero to 10,000 users, and if there is an 80 percent off-deal for something like shopping mall circulars or something, that they would jump on that, and piss away all their money", "and it\u2019s certainly, i think, books \u2013 a lot of books fail \u2013 and this true of presentations too \u2013 from too much miscellaneous information, not too little \u2013 if that makes any sense", "absolutely", "it\u2019s a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s really just a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s really just a matter of focus", "and going back to this speech\u00a0\u00a0 thing, i mean one of the \u2013 one of the pieces of advice, to the extent that anybody ever asked me for advice on giving speeches and what not \u2013 and it sounds a little like a \u2013 it sounds like a zen koan-ish sort of phrase \u2013 but basically, my point is, say something important rather than saying important things", "and i find out, a lot of times, people say something important, rather than say important things", "because i think a lot of times, people like to try to stuff within the skin all the things they\u2019ve found out, all the things that they know, and they end up not saying anything important", "and so \u2013 that\u2019s the reason for doing \u2013 anyway, you get the idea", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, i know", "and there are so many comparable examples", "if, for instance, you look for this vetting of ideas by putting together a short synopsis of some type", "and there\u2019s one example, for instance \u2013 and i believe this is true, i\u2019ve certainly heard it and read about it a few times, and i know a fair number of people who work at amazon, but they\u2019d have to confirm \u2013 but, i think, ian mcallister, who used to, at least, be a general manager at amazon, talked about this, is walking backwards", "and for new initiatives, the product manager who would be in charge of developing, say, a new product, has to write an internal press release which announces the finished product", "and that has to focus on, effectively, exactly what you said", "and i\u2019m quoting you from [inaudible], but, \u201ccentered around the customer problem how current solutions, internal or external fail, and how the new product would blow existing solutions away.\u201d and it\u2019s the same thing", "it\u2019s the same thing", "if you can\u2019t write that press release, how on earth are you going to navigate the decision-tree of getting to a product that finds its feet", "i mean, it could be very difficult \u2013 and not so say you don\u2019t iterate, but it\u2019s a good \u2013 it\u2019s a good filter through which you can at least catch the detritus that shouldn\u2019t make it to step 2", "oh, man, i have to say, i\u2019m your [inaudible] of course, on that press release technique", "i\u2019ve literally done that, working with \u2013 i think it\u2019s helpful for non-profit groups that i\u2019m involved in", "so if a nonprofit group wants to do a big project, but they\u2019re all over the place, they don\u2019t know exactly what they want to do \u2013 and i literally did this", "i said, \u201ci\u2019ll tell you what", "here\u2019s what i think the project is", "let me write a press release from two years from now, and i\u2019ll send it around.\u201d and it ended up being a \u2013 i had to get an idea from amazon too \u2013 and it ended up being this thing that was really, really focused", "so, \u201cthe bobbitybar group, announced, today, that it was doing bobbitybar,\u201d and then it\u2019s like \u2013 and it had quotes and things in it, and it ended up being this focal point on \u2013 for the whole organization on, \u201cwhat are we actually trying to accomplish here?\u201d so, i second that emotion there", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and just to return to another thing that you said \u2013 which i\u2019ll paraphrase here as, if everyone is your customer, no one\u2019s your customer \u2013 another filter or question that i use \u2013 or have used, i\u2019m not really in startup game anymore \u2013 but have used a lot with startups, because they\u2019ll ask me to review, say, a landing page, and look at copy, and messaging, and so on", "and before i would review it \u2013 if, with no further information i have to review it based on my pair of eyes, and my perspective, and my particular problems, that i can try to empathize and put myself in other people\u2019s shoes", "but i have to know whose shoes to put myself in", "and so, i\u2019ll ask them, \u201cif you could only have 1000 people sign up for this, who would they be and why?\u201d like, describe, for me \u2013 and this isn\u2019t a politically correct exercise \u2013 like what is gender, race of that matter is", "or maybe it doesn\u2019t", "where do they live", "what magazines or websites do they read", "what is their household income", "like really get granular about what these people have in common", "like, \u201cdo you want all the readers of people magazine", "do you want the 2000 people who [inaudible]", "do you want something in between", "like, really describe that for me.\u201d and only once that\u2019s been done can i actually get feedback on modifying any of the features or copy or messaging on a particular page.\u201d so, it\u2019s \u2013 these principles really transfer to a lot of different areas", "well, let me ask just a handful of additional questions, and then maybe we can do a round two sometime", "but you\u2019ve been talking a lot about the decisions you\u2019ve made, the routines that you have \u2013 and although you\u2019re very self-effacing, somebody could look at your bio and be very intimidated, and assume that you step up to the plate and hit home runs more often than not", "could you tell us about, maybe, a specific \u2013 if you\u2019re open to it \u2013 difficult period that you\u2019ve gone through, or down period, challenging period or failure \u2013 it could be any of those things \u2013 and what you did to get back on your feet, or the decisions you made that helped you then get back on firm ground, if anything comes to mind", "sure, sure, sure", "there are all kinds of things", "i mean, i hate to keep going back to the \u2013 i hate to keep going back to the law school days", "but i did leave law school after my first year, and i hated it so much that i went to india instead, and i traveled around \u2013 i traveled around india, incredible life-changing experience because i was a young guy \u2013 whatever old i was,\u00a0 25, 26 years old", "and at the time \u2013 it was a while ago, so at the time, india was even cheaper \u2013 well, much, much cheaper than it was", "so, if you\u2019re like a 25-year-old dud traveling on your own with a tiny little bit of money in your pocket, you can make it go very, very, very far", "and so \u2013 so, at the time, i guess i felt like \u2013 because i didn\u2019t do very well in my initial foray into law school, i didn\u2019t really like it, i was pretty miserable, i felt i had made a terrible decision, and i, at some level, just tried to escape", "and the way i got back into it was, essentially saying, \u201cokay, if i\u2019m going to do this, then i\u2019m going to try to figure out what are the one or two things that i can find valuable in this experience, and just try to power my way through", "and i guess that\u2019s all that i \u2013 i guess that\u2019s all that i did to overcome that", "but i felt pretty bad about how i didn\u2019t do very well, i didn\u2019t really like it, i felt i had made a ruinous decision about how my life was going to go", "and when i woke up and matured a little bit, i said, \u201cokay, some people make \u2013 like bad things actually happen to people.\u201d and i think going to india was actually helpful in that regard too, because, \u201cokay, i\u2019m not living in a tar paper shack with filthy water; i\u2019m just \u2013 i\u2019m not self-actualizing fast enough for a 25-year-old middle-class person", "that\u2019s not a real problem.\u201d and so, i think that, sort of putting the problems in perspective, and just trying to find some goodness in what you\u2019re doing next \u2013 and also, i just \u2013 like really deriving specific lessons from these kinds of failure", "and i think that\u2019s another part that\u2019s really important to me", "it\u2019s that, rather than \u2013 rather than simply allow this hazy notion of what you learn, i \u2013 again, i\u2019m a big believer in writing things down \u2013 i\u2019ll give you a better example of that", "and this is \u2013 i don\u2019t want to call this a major failure, because it\u2019s not that significant", "but i did a tv show for national geographic, and i worked with a tv series, and i worked with some really great people, and we put on a really, freaking great show", "and it didn\u2019t get picked up for a second season", "and \u2013 and so it was disappointing, but it\u2019s not like a massive failure, it\u2019s not like anything real in life", "but at that time, what i did is i said \u2013 i basically created a file and said, \u201cokay, here\u2019s what i learned from this experience, things that i learned from this experience.\u201d one, i like working with really talented people, people who helped me perform better", "two, i don\u2019t like to involved in projects that i don\u2019t have full creative control over", "three, working with people in traditional television can be very perilous, because they\u2019re subject to all kinds of pressures that are out of their control", "and so, you have this experience where things didn\u2019t go the way you wanted to, but if you actually, literally, write down the lessons, i think you can get something positive out of it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and was the writing down of these lessons more of a cathartic exercise, or are these \u2013 would you go back and revisit that", "you know what", "like for me, a lot of times, what i would do is, for me, and sometimes, certainly writing things down, it seems the act of writing it down is enough to solidify it", "so, i\u2019ll do the kind of thing where, before a talk or something like that, i will write an outline \u2013 basically, i know what i want to do, and then i\u2019ll take notes and write an outline of the speech and the things i want to hit, and then i literally would not look at it; like i, sometimes, won\u2019t even bring it with up with me", "i\u2019ll forget to bring it up with me", "because the act of \u2013 the act of actually memorizing it is really what gives it its oomph", "but what i don\u2019t want \u2013 what i\u2019m trying to say in a somewhat ham-handed way is that, like when you want to \u2013 you don\u2019t want those kinds of lessons to be hazy too much", "you want to, actually \u2013 like, \u201cwhat specific thing did i actually derive from this?\u201d, and i think that\u2019s really useful", "there\u2019s also a great technique that tina seelig has used \u2013 tina seelig who\u2019s at stanford has used \u2013 which she talks about \u2013 she writes a failure resume", "so, she has a resume of all her failures, and then with each one, what she learned from it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0when would she use something like that", "i mean, she keeps it for herself, but she would use it \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, i see", "it\u2019s an ongoing working document, just like a regular resume", "yeah, yeah", "an ongoing working document that basically \u2013 so you can look at and say, \u201coh, i made a lot of mistakes but here\u2019s what i learned from it, and don\u2019t make the same mistakes the second time.\u201d i don\u2019t mind making mistakes, what i don\u2019t like is making the same mistake twice", "tim ferriss:\u00a0with the \u2013 two questions on india: why india", "and then second, how did you decide to find the compelling benefits of continuing with law school versus changing course", "let\u2019s see", "you know what", "i think \u2013 okay, on the second one, i think i was too risk-averse to change course fully; i think that would have been too much, too much of a [inaudible] narcissist to leave altogether", "i probably would have \u2013 i probably would have felt like an abject failure, so i don\u2019t even think that was in the cards", "so, on the why india, a couple of reasons", "i had always been fascinated by it; i knew that i could get around, that the previous summer i had been to southern africa, and it was the first \u2013 i had never been out of the country, until i was 23 years old, never been \u2013 and so the first time i left the country, i went to southern africa on a \u2013 i raised some money to do this \u2013 to do a project there", "and that was a revelation, like, \u201choly crap, this world is lot bigger than i thought.\u201d and so, i wanted to go to someplace that wasn\u2019t europe, or someplace that was a little bit different from \u2013 a little bit more different from the united states", "and so, india was a place that i had always been fascinated by, it spoke english and it was cheap", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s a compelling combination for someone leaving law school for a period of time.\u00a0 yeah, when you\u2019re 25 years old \u2013 or however old i was \u2013 and you have a little money in your pocket, you can go so far on so little money; it was unbelievable to me \u2013 especially if you\u2019re willing to sleep \u2013 to take overnight trains rather than pay for a place to stay, or leave in these \u2013 go to sleep in these places where there\u2019s just a row of beds on a balcony and mosquito nets over each one", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, the \u2013 i mean, travel is one of those gifts that keep on giving in a sense \u2013 i would put books in that same category", "yeah, i agree", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you\u2019ve written a lot of books, you\u2019ve read even more books", "besides your own \u2013 and i\u2019ll just \u2013 going to segue into a couple of short questions \u2013 what books \u2013 are there any books that you\u2019ve gifted often to other people, or repeatedly given to people", "yeah", "oh, yeah", "so, they\u2019re probably books that you\u2019ve \u2013 i mean, it might have been books that you\u2019ve covered in your show here", "so, one of them is bird by bird by anne lamott, one of the greatest things ever", "i come back to that advice so many different times, it\u2019s the same even in the pink household, where we\u2019ll just say \u2013 like one member of my family would say to the other who\u2019s struggling, \u201cokay, bird by bird", "bird by bird.\u201d and so, i am a huge \u2013 and i stumbled into this book \u2013 i remember where i got this next book, i got it in the airport in san francisco, in the bookstore in the sfo", "and for some reason, i picked it up because it had this really weird cover", "but one of the first editions of the war of art by steven pressfield had this kind of silvery cover to it", "and i bought that book in \u2013 i think it was a campus bookstore in sfo, just because it\u2019s \u2013 i went, \u201coh, it\u2019s silver cover, and it\u2019s really short.\u201d i got it and it was like, \u201coh, my god", "i can\u2019t believe how good this book is.\u201d and so, i have even have a little sign on my desk here that says, \u201cbeat the resistance.\u201d so, i\u2019ve given that book a out a lot too", "so pressfield and lamott", "and then \u2013 man, i have to say, victor frankl\u2019s man\u2019s search for meaning is up there too.\u00a0 less \u2013 i\u2019ve given that out less, but that\u2019s a hugely important book for me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, that\u2019s one of those books i really need to re-read", "and i think you\u2019ve actually spoken about \u2013 let me get this right, i was about to say \u201canimal house,\u201d but that is not right \u2013 animal farm", "oh my god, animal farm is on one the greatest books ever", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and how you \u2013 it\u2019s a completely different experience as a book, at different points in your life", "absolutely right", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and the last time i read man\u2019s search for meaning was probably \u2013 i would say seven to ten years ago", "and a lot has changed in my life in that period of time", "i think that that is worthy of a re-read", "and have you \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019ve re-read each of these books also, also bird by bird, the war of art, man\u2019s search for meaning, yourself; you\u2019ve read these more than once", "yeah, yeah", "i\u2019ve read it more than once", "yeah", "but i\u2019m not a chronic re-reader; there are some people who are regularly \u2013 there are relatively few books that i have re-read", "but those i absolutely have", "and once \u2013 i had another experience in college \u2013 the only thing i remember in college are shards of things that the professors said, basically one-liners", "but i had a professor, once in college who \u2013 in an american studies course, he assigned us to read the adventures of huckleberry finn", "so, you\u2019re in college, and your professor assigns you to read the adventures of huckleberry finn, people are like, \u201coh \u2013\u201d because everybody read that book in high school", "and he said something \u2013 he said the following words, he says, \u201ci know you read that book, but you haven\u2019t read that book,\u201d meaning the person you are today", "and that ends up being \u2013 it ended up being true", "so, i\u2019ve read animal farm at different points in my life, and had different views on it", "i\u2019ve read great gatsby] at different points in my life", "i have seen the play, death of a salesman \u2013 i don\u2019t know, probably seven times", "and each one feels a little bit different to me", "i had a completely different view of death of a salesman once i became a father versus before i became a father", "i had another view of death of a salesman before i knew about \u2013 had read about psychopharmacology and mental illness and after i did", "and so, i think that that \u2013 i think those kinds of experiences are really fascinating", "animal farm, i was like, \u201coh, really cool", "it\u2019s about the soviet union and how power corrupts, and blah, blah, blah.\u201d and now, i read the book, it\u2019s like, \u201cokay, this book is basically about organizational dysfunction", "who cares whether it was supposed to be about the soviet union, this book is about the acme widget corporation and how screwed human organizations are.\u201d like this \u2013 i think that animal farm should be in every organizational behavior class in an mba program", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s another one i need to re-read \u2013 not a long book, either", "i mean, i read that in sixth-grade or something", "i mean, completely unequipped", "you\u2019ll see it \u2013 you\u2019ll see it completely differently", "that\u2019s a great book", "i\u2019ve read [inaudible] multiple times too", "tim ferriss:\u00a0also a very timely book", "well, on that front i read the handmaid\u2019s tale for the first time", "i was, sort of, 30 years late to it, but i read, and i loved that book", "i have a whole \u2013 i\u2019m not joking around, and if you want validation, i\u2019ll send you a photograph of it \u2013 i basically have a stack of books right here that are, basically, dystopia books that include philip roth the plot against america, an octavia butler book, sinclair lewis\u2019 it can\u2019t happen here, another sci-fi book by eliot peper called cumulus, and other one called infomocracy by malka older", "i have a whole \u2013 i\u2019m basically \u2013 i have a whole pile of dystopian works", "tim ferriss:\u00a0why is that", "why do you \u2013 why do you read so much dystopia", "because i want to understand the current moment more clearly", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, this might be \u2013 this might be an appropriate next question", "it doesn\u2019t have to be related to what you just said, but if you could put a short message on a billboard \u2013 metaphorically speaking \u2013 to get a word, a quote, a question to millions or billions of people, what might you put on that billboard", "well, it\u2019s interesting, because i think it is related to what we\u2019re just talking about \u2013 or maybe, the fact that you asked it in this context made me relate it", "but one of the \u2013 one of the things that i would write would be \u201cassume positive intent.\u201d that would fit very nicely on a billboard", "assume positive intent", "because i think \u2013 and i\u2019ve changed my view on this, tim", "i\u2019ve actually, in some ways, become \u2013 i\u2019ve certainly gone the reverse \u2013 like, basically, the general view is that people are idealistic when they\u2019re young, and cynical when they\u2019re older, and i\u2019ve actually become less cynical as i\u2019ve gotten older", "and the other thing is, basically, on politics, like there\u2019s this old line in politics that everybody dies a republican", "because, as you get older, and you have something to conserve, you become more conservative; i find myself going, actually, the opposite direction as i understand more about the world", "but the point of all that \u201cassume positive intent\u201d is that, i think \u2013 and it goes to our politics right now \u2013 is that a lot of times", "i don\u2019t know \u2013 i just think, like, your default \u2013 you know this already \u2013 our default settings are so important in any realm of our lives", "and i think, a lot of times, if your default setting is that people have \u2013 everybody you deal with has negative intent, that\u2019s going to lead you down one pathway, there\u2019s no question about it", "and here\u2019s the thing: i don\u2019t think that\u2019s true", "i really \u2013 my experience as a human being is that some people, obviously, have negative intent, but most people do not; most people actually have positive intent", "so, my view it that if you assume positive intent on the part of others and let them disprove that, that\u2019s a better way to go, than to assume negative intent and say, \u201ci\u2019m going to assume that you have negative intent, tim ferriss, until you prove that you actually have positive intent.\u201d i think just doing the reverse is better: assume positive intent", "not that \u2013 i\u2019m not pollyanna here, i don\u2019t think everybody has positive intent", "but i think most people do, and if you just make that your default setting, you\u2019re going to have better interactions with people, you\u2019re going to learn a lot more", "tim ferriss:\u00a0the default setting \u2013 default state, as you put it \u2013 in this case, creates a completely different experience of reality", "absolutely", "tim ferriss:\u00a0whether it\u2019s guilty until proven innocent, as you look at everyone and anything around you, or innocent until proven guilty", "and i remember you were talking about these one-liners, these shards that stick in the mind", "i remember \u2013 i can\u2019t \u2013 i can\u2019t recall who said this to me, but they said, if you go out one day, and you walk around, and you meet an asshole, that person is an asshole; if, on the other hand, you go out and everyone you meet is an asshole, you are the asshole", "and if you assume that everyone has negative intent, you yourself become that which you loathe", "nice point", "that\u2019s a really good point", "that\u2019s a really good point", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i love that: assume positive intent", "well, it \u2013 it also fits on a billboard", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it does", "that\u2019s the other \u2013 i mean to actually take that thing very literally, it\u2019s like literally picturing in my head, like what would be \u2013 what could fit on the billboard", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, i think that\u2019s a great place to wrap", "i mentioned a few things at the top of the show, danpink.com, @danielpink on twitter, facebook/danielhpink", "is there anything else that you would like to mention as a closing comment, request, and ask of the audience \u2013 anything else you would like to say", "no, i mean we\u2019ve covered a lot \u2013 we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, and if people have listened this far, god bless them", "i mean, i can\u2019t \u2013 even i am not that ungrateful to ask for something more after this kind of indulgence", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, i\u2019m a big fan of your work; i have been for a very long time \u2013 including johnny bunko, which i still have to this day", "so, you may recall ages ago \u2013 lifetimes ago \u2013 i think it was at south by southwest, actually, which is timely since i now live in austin, texas \u2013 you inscribed, you signed a copy of that book for me, which i still have", "i\u2019ve carried it with me \u2013 i remember where we were sitting", "i do", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, i appreciate it, and i still have the book", "and it\u2019s really been nice to reconnect and catch up a bit", "indeed", "yeah, yeah", "it\u2019s been fun \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s been fun to watch all the great thing that you\u2019re doing, and this massive audience that you\u2019ve built", "and just \u2013 i\u2019ve gotten so much \u2013 my dog-eared \u2013 too bad we\u2019re not on video, but i can show my dog-eared copy of tools of titans, which is a great book title by the way", "tim ferriss:\u00a0awesome", "it is the only book title that came easily; it is the only one", "all the other ones were agonizing, agonizing, agonizing sessions of brainstorming, and picking one of the titles among many that i felt dissatisfied with", "tools of titans for whatever reason \u2013 thanks to the universe or whatever powers may be, or luck that may have happened upon me, but that is one that just kind of came, and i was like, \u201chey, that\u2019s the title.\u201d and that was it", "i didn\u2019t \u2013 i also didn\u2019t realize that you were in austin", "how did you end up in austin \u2013 or why did you end up in austin", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 i have felt a gravitational pull to austin for a very long time", "i, in fact, wanted to move here right out of college, but i didn\u2019t get the job [inaudible] [02:00:39] \u2013 made it to the final round of interviews which brought me out to austin, really fell in love with the town", "though, the baseline of friendliness and warmth here, of neighborly feel is higher than just about any other place i\u2019ve experienced", "and then, instead of getting a job here, i got a job in the bay area, which took me to san jose, and mountain view, and san francisco for the better part of nearly 20 years \u2013 which i loved for that period of time", "but, much like with books, i think that you visit places, and your experience of those places changes over time, and what attracted me to the bay area, i think, has morphed into something else, and \u2013 i have also morphed into someone else", "and it felt like a good time for me to experiment with a new location", "also, i found myself in the very \u2013 almost inescapable conversation of tech to be just drinking the kool-aid a little too heavily, or repeatedly, or believing my own bullshit maybe \u2013 not necessarily bullshit, but getting caught up in a lot of platitudes that are thrown around so often in silicon valley, to have become part of the daily vernacular and that scared me quite frankly, that i was like, \u201cwait a second, if i look back at the last five to six months, how many conversations have i had that don\u2019t include the following twelve words, or twelve expressions?\u201d i was like, \u201cwow, i can actually count them on both hands.\u201d interesting", "interesting", "where did you grow up", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i grew up at the very end of long island and was born [inaudible] in the hamptons, which is a very odd thing to be", "for anyone who\u2019s seen the affair \u2013 i have not, but i\u2019ve heard of the affair, this tv show that is, apparently quite popular, a lot it takes place in this restaurant called the [inaudible], which is montauk, and i used to be a busboy at the [inaudible] oh, wow", "nice", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so long island is where this \u2013 this whole thing started", "weirdly, i remember from \u2013 4-hour workweek, i think that you described yourself as a \u201chellion\u201d", "tim ferriss:\u00a0a little hellion", "good memory", "which is a great word, it was such a great word", "but i realized i didn\u2019t have a geographic sense of where you grew up; it\u2019s interesting", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, i think the use of \u201chellion\u201d is actually in the dedication to my parents, and my mum", "yeah, i think that\u2019s right", "i think that\u2019s right", "you know why", "and one reason i remember that is that i listened to part \u2013 i got part of that book on audiobook, and i remember at the beginning \u2013 because you read that book, i\u2019m almost certain", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it was ray porter who has a voice that is easily mistaken for my various mannerisms that i\u2019ve developed now to be a \u2013 that was ray porter", "he did a great job", "wow", "interesting", "okay", "but i\u2019m pretty sure that \u2013 i don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just a great word", "tim ferriss:\u00a0it is a good word", "it is a good word", "i\u2019m going to try to use it in the next 24 hours", "when i come up with a good \u2013 when i hear a good word, i try to drop it in the next 24 hours, just because it helps to reinforce it for me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, i\u2019m going to try to use surrogation, and i\u2019m going to try to eat more hard-boiled eggs in the next 24 hours", "you\u2019re golden", "golden, man", "your life would change markedly if you start employing the principle of surrogation while eating hard-boiled eggs", "everything will \u2013 the sun would come shining up and \u2013 the sun would burst out from behind the clouds, and unicorns would scamper across your front lawn", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, my dog would love that", "and dan, this has been \u2013 this has been a lot of fun", "thank you", "thanks a lot for having me", "i appreciate it", "it was really interesting", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and for everybody listening, as always, you can find links to everything including dan\u2019s social website, the new book when, and much more in the show notes, which you can find at tim.blog/podcast", "and until next time, thanks for listening"]}
