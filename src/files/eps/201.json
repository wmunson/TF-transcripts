This particular episode, I\u2019m going to try to do one better. I\u2019m excited to bring you a little sample taste test of a new show format that I\u2019m working on. And this isn\u2019t going to displace the other \u2013 it\u2019s just to complement it. And I\u2019m calling it, for lack of a better name, for the time being, \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Radio Hour,\u201d and you\u2019ll see where this is going. And, after nearly 200 hours of conversations with world-class performers all over the map, including people like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Foxx, Tony Robbins, Maria Popova, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, Amanda Palmer, Malcolm Gladwell, Rick Rubin, Reid Hoffman, and so many more, you start to spot patterns or at least, when I\u2019m reviewing all of the transcripts, I spot patterns. Sometimes they\u2019re months apart but these are the shared habits, philosophies, tools, and more that are the common thread or the common threat. And this is the premise, of course, of my new book, Tools of Titans, which is a compilation of all of my favorite patterns, all of my favorite routines \u2013 you can check that out everywhere \u2013 but that\u2019s also where \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Radio Hour\u201d comes in. In each episode, we\u2019ll take a deep dive into one specific topic or tactic, bringing together the collective genius of past guests to help you, hopefully, become world-class in your own right if you aren\u2019t already. At the very least, it will give you a common thread, as I mentioned, with slight tweaks here and there that you can customize, in effect, to your idiosyncrasies \u2013 to your own personality \u2013 or you can blend them together. And, today, in this sneak peek episode, we will be exploring meditation. Meditation, or practicing mindfulness, is by far the most common pattern across them all. In this episode, for instance, I ask Chase Jarvis to explain his top priorities for feeling fulfilled. Chase Jarvis: I\u2019ve found sort of a new passion for sleep. I can\u2019t ever \u2013 not never \u2013 but I rarely get the eight, nine, ten \u2013\u201d Tim Ferriss: I talk TM \u2013 that\u2019s transcendental meditation \u2013 with the Terminator, the Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold Schwarzenegger: I would say within 14 days, 3 weeks, I got to the point where I could really disconnect my mind and also learn how to focus more and to calm down. Tim Ferriss: I cover a wide spectrum with Sam Harris and talk about everything \u2013 or ask him about everything from hallucinogens to meditation techniques. Sam Harris: The unique power of psychedelics is that they are guaranteed to work in some way. Tim Ferriss: And then I wrap up with Rainn Wilson discussing how to handle life when you feel overwhelmed \u2013 and we all end up, at points, feeling overwhelmed or, at the very least, unclear. Rainn Wilson: It was the key for me as an actor that kind of broke me open and got me out of my head and just got me in my body and in that place of kind of pure imagination and spontaneity that you really want as an actor. Tim Ferriss: We start our deep dive on meditation with Chase Jarvis, CEO of CreativeLive which is an online learning platform that broadcasts live, of course, high-definition classes to more than 10 million students in 200 plus countries. Chase was also the youngest person ever to be named a Hasselblad Master, Nikon Master, and ASMP Master. He has photographed for Nike, Apple, Columbia Sportswear, REI, Honda, Subaru, Polaroid, Lady Gaga, Red Bull, and many more. He\u2019s one of the most successful commercial photographers on the planet. So, without further ado, let\u2019s jump into the first episode of \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Radio Hour.\u201d Enjoy. [Intro music] Tim Ferriss: What do you feel have become your top priorities in feeling happy or fulfilled? What are the things, as you become wiser, that you\u2019ve learned to prize more or prize less? Chase Jarvis: Health. Tim Ferriss: Hmm. Yeah. Chase Jarvis: One\u2019s health and being active is incredibly valuable. And I feel like and old person saying this next one but sleep. I have lived on four to six hours of sleep for the last ten years so just prioritizing sleep. And the third one is meditation. Meditation is \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. We haven\u2019t talked about this in a while. Aha. Chase Jarvis: You were on it for a good bit and you said you felt \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I was. I fell off the wagon but, yeah, you were one of two people that I credit with finally kicking me in the ass to take it seriously. Chase Jarvis: It has really been a good thing \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah, specifically TM? So Transcendental Meditation for those who don\u2019t know \u2013 or Trademark. Chase Jarvis: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But I have my issues with almost every form of meditation. There are pros and cons \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about them before \u2013 but tell me about your meditation practice. Chase Jarvis: My meditation practice is not perfect and none are. I just sit down between 15 and 20 minutes twice a day. Sometimes, I only get one time a day, sometimes, those are a little compressed or shit happens \u2013 you\u2019re on an airplane and the captain comes on and pulls you out of it \u2013 or whatever. But I make a conscious effort to just observe my thoughts and practice TM in the morning and the evening before dinner and it has made \u2013 The analogy that I can most simply put here on your show is it\u2019s when you\u2019re in the zone \u2013 say, playing sports or playing music \u2013 and things just seem effortless. It\u2019s called a \u201cflow state.\u201d Steven Kotler\u2019s new book \u2013 which is a good book, The Rise of Superman, check that out, a little plug for his book about creativity and flow states \u2013 but that sense of flow, it\u2019s when things sort of happen in slow motion. Now, you\u2019re not literally talking in slow motion but you have the same clarity as if you\u2019re going through life and everything\u2019s happening in slow motion. Instead of that, \u201cI\u2019m hyper-caffeinated, my boss is \u2013\u201d [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u201cI\u2019m agitated and reactive \u2013 dodging bullets\u201d [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: Yeah. \u201cAhhhh.\u201d Instead, you\u2019re just like, \u201cI\u2019m driving the bus here and we\u2019re going to go here, and then I\u2019m going to do this.\u201d And there\u2019s this certain clarity it\u2019s like magic. It\u2019s really weird. And there\u2019s one other thing \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve felt this, Tim, but it sort of aggregates so you get a good benefit from one, two, three, four, then when you\u2019re on a roll, there\u2019s this sort of exponential \u2013 there\u2019s a sort of overdrive \u2013 and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh my gosh, I feel like I\u2019m just floating.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I can\u2019t explain it, either but, for me \u2013 and just for those people who might be thinking like I did for my entire life \u2013 Chase Jarvis: \u201cBullshit.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah, \u201cBullshit.\u201d No, \u201cI don\u2019t want people \u2018Ohm-ing\u2019 me in fricking all this \u2013\u201d Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chakra, whatever. I\u2019m not into it. Especially living in San Francisco, I\u2019ve developed an allergy to sanctimonious \u2013 and I\u2019ve been to Burning Man \u2013 but sanctimonious burner types who want to lecture me about chakras. I\u2019m just like, \u201cHonestly, please, I can\u2019t handle another minute of this.\u201d So I\u2019ve had this aversion to meditation but, when it\u2019s very sort of non-dogmatic \u2013 where it\u2019s like, look, you\u2019re not trying to control anything, you\u2019re not trying to think of a candle flame \u2013 just observe your thoughts and be okay with them and sit with good posture for a period of time, that\u2019s it. Even if you think it\u2019s a shitty job and you\u2019re running through your to-do list or thinking of the stock market, that\u2019s okay. Just make it part of your routine. And what I found was \u2013 and some well-known people who do TM are like Paul McCartney or Ariana Huffington \u2013 Chase Jarvis: David Lynch. Tim Ferriss: David Lynch. I\u2019m blanking on his name for some reason but Bridgewater Capital \u2013 largest hedge fund in, if not the world, the United States. $100 billion plus. [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: Russell Simmons. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Ray Dalio. Russell Simmons. Chase Jarvis: The list is \u2013 I think Howard Stern \u2013 it\u2019s crazy. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: The list is pretty amazing, yes. Jerry Seinfeld. And the physiological or psychological effects are so fascinating, like you said, because you\u2019ll do it for a couple of days and you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, yeah, okay, whatever,\u201d and then you hit \u2013 [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: I\u2019m sleepy. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: You hit this sort of inflection point where you just drop from 200 rpms to 150 and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhoa, okay, this is different,\u201d and then, the whole week, you\u2019re kind of zenned out and then, after, say, a four-week period \u2013 And I did my first retreat a few months ago before I volunteered for the masochism that is television production. [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: I could just hit you with a stick for a couple weeks. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah, if you could put a nail through it first, that\u2019d be great. Chase Jarvis: Sure. Tim Ferriss: But really had this tremendous effect on me that, oddly enough \u2013 and maybe this is getting too out there for some people \u2013 but very similar to my experiences post-relatively high dose hallucinogens. This extended period of calm \u2013 [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: Grace. Yes. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Or ease in decision making \u2013 uncluttered. Like you closed every browser on your computer, and turned off the antivirus, and rebooted the whole thing \u2013 that type of feeling. So I did fall of the train. Question for you \u2013 because, the morning session, I usually find pretty easy. Afternoon, what do you do? [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: Yeah. Afternoon\u2019s hard. I\u2019m right now thinking of, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got to go from here to the thing, to the thing. Alright, when am I going to get my thing in? Oh, shit.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sometimes I\u2019ll try to do it in the car \u2013 like Uber or whatever. [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: That\u2019s not bad. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: But when do you typically do it in the afternoon? I\u2019m curious. Chase Jarvis: I try and do it before dinner sometime \u2013 between work and dinner. We\u2019re entrepreneurs, we work \u2013 it\u2019s tough \u2013 crazy long hours so I\u2019ll take it whenever I can get it. And it\u2019s usually a little less gracious than my morning one. Like you said, it\u2019s like morning is like it\u2019s your time, you carve out 20 minutes. So, my afternoon one is often a little bit more piecemeal. But, again, it\u2019s the act \u2013 I try not to judge the practice \u2013 the practice is the practice. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. When you meditate, are you sitting cross-legged, are you sitting with your feet on the floor? Chase Jarvis: I try to sit in a comfortable chair with my feet flat on the floor, hands on my lap. And there\u2019s a mantra \u2013 if you learn TM, you\u2019re given a mantra \u2013 and say that word over and over. And, if some thoughts come in, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s those thoughts. Bye,\u201d and then they go away and you keep doing it over again. And then, sometimes, like, \u201cOh my god, that was 25 minutes,\u201d and, sometimes, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh my god, that was one minute. It felt like a week.\u201d And, again, but just not judging that and \u2013 And it\u2019s \u2013 without continuing to talk about it because now it\u2019s getting weird because we\u2019re talking about it so much \u2013 but it\u2019s just a powerful tool that is so simple. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m just mind melding while you\u2019re talking. Chase Jarvis: That\u2019s great. You\u2019re meditating. You\u2019re staring off into space. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t been listening to you. For the last 20 minutes, I haven\u2019t been listening \u2013 [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: For the listening people, Tim is staring off into space right now. He\u2019s not paying attention to us. Tim Ferriss: Okay. That is, I think, a huge takeaway for people that it doesn\u2019t have to be TM \u2013 it could be vipassana, anything. Building in a pause, just like a warm bath for your brain, even if it\u2019s ten minutes a day, so that you\u2019re not in a reactive mode \u2013 it\u2019s really a game changer. And, physiologically, had a lot of effects for me, as well. [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: Oh, yeah. The studies are crazy. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: So, when my cortisol levels dropped \u2013 I was able to lose body fat more easily in my abdomen, for instance. Really became very sensitive to alcohol and caffeine so I dropped them both significantly \u2013 not because I was getting judgmental about it but because I was over sensitized to it. I\u2019d grown immune to the effects so I could have six cups of coffee a day and be like, \u201cEh,\u201d and did TM for four or five weeks and it was like I had one cup and I was like, \u201cWow.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize what my baseline was. So just maybe to \u2013 [Crosstalk] Chase Jarvis: It makes you a cheap date, by the way, too. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve always been a cheap date. [Music] Tim Ferriss: So, with that, I thought you might like to know about some of my current meditation routines or how I\u2019m incorporating mindfulness into my day. First and foremost, upon waking, there are a few things that I do. I get up, generally take a cold shower, do some Wim Hoff breathing \u2013 which is a whole separate podcast \u2013 and make my bed, etc. I have my five things that I do in the morning \u2013 there\u2019s a separate episode on this \u2013 but the meditation comes in right after I\u2019ve set the kettle to boil some water or get it to 185 for tea. I sit down, I do 21 minutes of transcendental meditation although I should 20 minutes of meditation. The first minute is really just to allow myself to fidget and get settled. I\u2019m sitting on the couch in an effectively half lotus position \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at all, you could sit with your feet on the floor \u2013 I just happen to be comfortable that way. And for the first few minutes, I\u2019m actually mimicking the format of Headspace, the app, in many ways. I\u2019m really focusing on what is happening already \u2013 the sensations of, say, my legs against the couch, the feeling of my breathing \u2013 and you could look at it as a form, in some sense, of vipassana meditation. Then I segway into the mantra-based TM. That is simply what I\u2019ve found to work well for me, and, oddly enough, it seems that a high percentage of men gravitate, ultimately, towards TM and high percentage of women gravitate towards vipassana. That is not true across the board at all. Sam Harris, for instance, practices a number of types of meditation, none of which are TM. Now, another guest who I asked about meditation was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 30th governor of California, seven-time Mr. Olympia. And something, perhaps, a lot of people don\u2019t know, he was a Golden Globe winner in 1976 for his role in Stay Hungry\u00a0with Jeff Bridges and Sally Fields. He has done everything \u2013 he\u2019s reinvented himself over and over again. And the other place that you might find mindfulness in my life is where Arnold also has it which is in the gym. If we\u2019re trying to cultivate present state awareness and less reactivity, you don\u2019t have to sit down and think of a mantra to do it \u2013 there are multiple ways. So that all having been said, here we go delving into meditation with no other than Arnold Schwarzenegger. [Music] Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve heard you mention transcendental meditation in passing, briefly. Do you meditate? Arnold Schwarzenegger: I don\u2019t meditate now but I got heavily into it in the \u201970s and I remember there was a time in my life where I felt like everything\u2019s just coming together and I did not find a way \u2013 or couldn\u2019t find a way \u2013 of keeping the things separate. So it was always when I was thinking about it at the same time \u2013 I was thinking about my body building career, I was thinking about my movie career, I was thinking about the documentary Pumping Iron\u00a0that we\u2019re shooting right now and the movie Stay Hungry\u00a0that we just finished shooting, and my investment in the apartment building, do we get the financing from the bank \u2013 and all of this kind of stuff was always coming together and, at the same time, I was training for the Mr. Olympia competition in South Africa. And I was training right here at Gold\u2019s Gym and I remember there was all the camera equipment around 5 hours a day in my face and then someone, in the middle of squatting, was trying to change the batter pack on my lifting belt and all this stuff. So, yeah, eventually, I felt like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do something about it because I have such great opportunities here and everything is happening, and everything is going my way, but I\u2019m just clustering everything into one big problem rather than separating it out, and having calm, and peace, and being happy.\u201d And so, in a total coincidence, I ran into this guy that I\u2019ve run into many times on the beach \u2013 very, very pleasant man \u2013 who told me that he\u2019s a teacher in transcendental meditation and I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s interesting you mention it because I feel like I should do something because I feel like I\u2019m just overly worried and have anxieties and all this stuff. And I feel certain pressures that I have never felt before.\u201d And then he says, \u201cOh, Arnold, it\u2019s not uncommon. It\u2019s very common. A lot of people go through this. This is why people use meditation. Transcendental meditation is one way of dealing with problem.\u201d And he was very good in selling it because he didn\u2019t say it\u2019s the only answer \u2013 he just said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of many.\u201d And he says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try it? I\u2019m a teacher there up in Westwood. I would not be able to teach you since we are friends but there will be another teacher that will give you a mantra and blah, blah, blah, and teach you how to do it. And then I can help you after that,\u201d he says, \u201cBecause I will be teaching, obviously. Why don\u2019t you come up on Thursday? And I will be there. I will introduce you to the folks up there.\u201d And so I went up there, took a class, and I went home after that and then tried it. I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to give it a shot,\u201d and I did 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes at night. And I would say, within 14 days, three weeks, I got to the point where I really could disconnect my mind and, as they say, to find a few seconds of this connection and rejuvenate the mind and also learn how to focus more and to calm down. And I saw the effect right away that I was much more calm about all of the challenges that were facing me and I continued doing that, then, for a year. And, by that time, I felt like, \u201cI think that I\u2019ve mastered this. I think that now I don\u2019t feel overwhelmed anymore.\u201d And I really felt it one of the things where, in the transcendental meditation was anxiety and pressure meeting around the corner tranquility. This is what it felt like. And so I was happy from that point and, even today, I still benefit from that because I don\u2019t merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem \u2013 I take on one challenge at a time. And, when I go and I study my script for a movie, then, that day \u2013 when I study my script for a movie \u2013 I don\u2019t let anything else interfere in that. I just concentrate on that. And the other thing that I\u2019ve learned is that there\u2019s many forms of meditation because, when I study and I work really hard \u2013 it takes the ultimate amount of concentration \u2013 I can only do it for 45 minutes, maybe \u2013 maybe an hour. But then I have to run off and maybe play chess. And I play chess for 15 minutes and then I can go back and have all the energy in the world again and jump right back and then continue on with my work as if I\u2019ve not done it at all today. Right? It\u2019s like I\u2019m fresh. And so that\u2019s another way I think of meditation. And then I also figured out that I could use my workouts as a form of meditation because I concentrate so much on the muscle and I have my mind inside the bicep when I do my curls. I have my mind inside the pectoral muscles when I do my bench press. So I\u2019m really inside and it\u2019s like a form of meditation because you have no chance of thinking or concentrating on anything else at that time but just that training that you do. And so there\u2019s many ways of meditation and I benefit from all of those and I\u2019m, today, much calmer, and much more organized, and much more tranquil because of that. Tim Ferriss: This whole conversation makes me want to go tackle the world. I love it. [Music] Tim Ferriss: Next, I want to reintroduce one of my most popular and controversial guests, Sam Harris. He is brilliant. Sam has a Ph.D. in Neuroscience and the author of many best-selling books including, The End of Faith, Freewill, Lyin, and Waking Up. Our first conversation on this podcast explored science, different types of meditation and the uses and risks of psychedelics among many other things and that conversation included segments such as this. [Music] Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s a quote here that is, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing irrational about seeking the states of mind that lie at the core of many religions: compassion, awe and devotion, feelings of oneness are surely among the most valuable experiences a person can have.\u201d Assuming that\u2019s true \u2013 and you and I have, of course, talked about altered states and you\u2019ve written about altered states \u2013 I\u2019d love to just dig into that expression or that quote, rather, and look at the alternate approaches that you\u2019ve perhaps explored or researched related to achieving some of these valuable states. Sam Harris: Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, in the beginning of my career, as you point out, I spent a lot of time criticizing religion and criticizing it for its obvious harms. But one of its harms that\u2019s not so obvious is that it keeps us talking about this positive end of human experience \u2013 this self-transcendence and highly normative states of consciousness in First Century or Seventh Century terms and most people, most of the time, think that the only way to capture \u201cspiritual experience\u201d \u2013 and one\u2019s interest in it and the ways in which one would explore it \u2013 is to, to some degree, indulge the myth-intoxicated language of the Iron Age. There\u2019s just no way to talk about it otherwise. Science hasn\u2019t given us the tools to talk about it, secular tools doesn\u2019t give us the tools to talk about it, and so we\u2019re left talking about being Christians, and Muslims, and Jews, and Buddhists and organize our lives around the really incompatible truth claims and doctrines that you find in those religions And very smart people who are secular in every other way think there\u2019s just no alternative to that and so one of my main interests now is in articulating an alternative because, clearly, there are extraordinary experiences that people have and many of these experiences do lie at the core of many of our religions. And so, to take Jesus as an obvious example \u2013 who knows who Jesus actually was and what is historically true in the New Testament? But let\u2019s just say, for our argument\u2019s sake, that there really was a guy who loved his neighbor as himself and had this extraordinarily charismatic effect on the people around him, and bore witness to this possibility of a radical self-transcendence. Well, clearly, whatever\u2019s true there is deeper than Christianity and it\u2019s not reducible to Christianity. In fact, Christianity has to be a distortion of that truth and we know this because Jesus isn\u2019t the only person who\u2019s had that experience. There\u2019s the Buddha and then countless contemplatives through the ages can attest to this experience of, for lack of a better phrase, unconditional love and that has some relationship to what I would call self-transcendence which I think is even more important. And so there\u2019s this phenomenon that\u2019s clearly deeper than any of our provincial ways of talking about it in the context of religion. And so there\u2019s a deeper truth of human psychology and the nature of consciousness and I think we need to explore it in terms that don\u2019t require that we lie to ourselves or to our children about the nature of reality and that we don\u2019t indulge this divisive language of picking teams in the contest among religions. So, yeah, my next book that\u2019s coming out in the fall is called Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion\u00a0and it\u2019s about the phenomenon of self-transcendence and the ways in which people can explore it without believing anything on insufficient evidence. And one of the principal ways is various techniques of meditation \u2013 mindfulness being, I think, the most useful one to adopt first. There\u2019s also the use of psychedelic drugs which is not quite the same as meditation but it does, if nothing else, it reveals that the human nervous system is plastic in a very important way which means your experience of the world can be very radically transformed. You are tending to be who you were yesterday by virtue of various habit patterns and physiological homeostasis and other things that are keeping you very recognizable to yourself but it\u2019s possible to have a very different experience. And it\u2019s possible to do that through pharmacology, it\u2019s possible to do that through some kind of crisis or it\u2019s possible to do it through a deliberate form of training like meditation. And I think it\u2019s crucial to do because we all want to be as happy, and as fulfilled, or as free of pain and suffering as we can possibly be and all of our suffering and all of our unhappiness is a product of how our minds are in every moment. And so, if there\u2019s a way to use the mind itself to improve one\u2019s capacity for moment-to-moment well-being \u2013 which I\u2019m convinced there is \u2013 then this should be potentially of interest to everybody. Tim Ferriss: So a couple of quick questions on all of the subjects. So the first I\u2019d like to touch on, meditation \u2013 I think we can probably touch on this briefly \u2013 is something we\u2019ve discussed before. You, along with many other people who are high performers in their respective fields have recommended meditation so I have been meditating, partially in thanks to your influence for some time now. Is it safe to say that the meditation that you most frequently recommend to novices is vipassana meditation or is that \u2013? Sam Harris: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Got it. Why is that? I\u2019ve experimented with a number of different types \u2013 transcendental meditation, vipassana, of course, and have taken a number of courses \u2013 why that selection? Why that choice? Sam Harris: Yeah, it has a few obvious strengths that are actually not shared by any other technique I know of. The first is that it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it needn\u2019t \u2013 presuppose any belief about anything. You don\u2019t have to develop a fondness for the iconography of Buddhism. You don\u2019t have to care about the Buddha. You don\u2019t have to believe in rebirth, or karma \u2013 none of the doctrine of Buddhism need be adopted in order to get the practice off the ground and never need be adopted if it never makes any sense which much of it doesn\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to become a Buddhist to do this and you don\u2019t have to add anything strategically to your experience as a mechanism by which to meditate. So you\u2019re not adding a mantra, you\u2019re not visualizing something that isn\u2019t there. You don\u2019t have to look at a candle flame or do anything to your environment by way of artifice to create the circumstance of meditation. All you\u2019re doing is paying exquisitely close and non-judgmental attention to whatever you\u2019re experiencing anyway. And the first technique you use to be able to train that capacity is to focus on your breath which you always have with you and is just an easy objective to focus on. But it doesn\u2019t even have to be the breath \u2013 mindfulness is just that quality of mind which allows you to pay attention to sights, and sounds, and sensations, and even thought themselves without being lost in thought and without grasping it was pleasant and pushing what is an unpleasant away. So, just being wide open to the next sensory or emotional experience that comes careening into consciousness \u2013 that is mindfulness. And so, in some sense, it\u2019s not even a practice, it\u2019s just the state of not being distracted and being aware. And it feels like a practice in the beginning because it\u2019s hard to do \u2013 we\u2019re so deeply conditioned to be lost in thought and to be having this conversation with ourselves from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep. It just chatter in the mind and we\u2019re so captivated that we\u2019re not even aware of it. We are essentially in a dream state and it\u2019s through this veil of thought that we go about our day and perceive our environments but we are just talking to ourselves non-stop and, until you can break that spell and begin to notice thoughts, themselves, as objects of consciousness just arising and passing away, you can\u2019t even pay attention to your breath or anything else with any kind of clarity. And so, initially, you have to develop some concentration and get mindfulness in-depth so that you can pay attention but, once you can pay attention, it doesn\u2019t matter what you pay attention to. There\u2019s nothing, in principle, that is outside the meditation process. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s, in principle, that\u2019s a distraction. You don\u2019t need a quiet environment \u2013 you can have loud construction noises going across the street and it\u2019s just as good of circumstance for meditation as anything else. And those are the main reasons why I think it\u2019s the, in terms of being designed for export outside of Buddhist culture or religious culture, generally, and becoming a tool for our intellectual lives in a secular, scientific context, I think there\u2019s nothing like it. Tim Ferriss: What resources would you suggest for someone who wants to try to educate themselves or dive in as a novice in terms of books, resources, websites for mindfulness and meditation? Sam Harris: Yeah. Well, I give a few on my blog. I wrote an article a couple years ago entitled, \u201cHow To Meditate,\u201d and, if people Google that, they\u2019ll see that I link to a few books and I tell people where they can go on retreats and I briefly describe the practice. I also have given a couple of guided mindfulness meditations I\u2019ve put on SoundCloud which are on my website as well. And there are other guided meditations out there that people can use. And, in the beginning, some people find that very helpful to have somebody\u2019s voice essentially reminding them to not be lost in thought every few seconds. Because what happens in the beginning for people \u2013 and this happened to me in my practice for at least a year \u2013 I think it was a year before I went on intensive silent retreat. I was just sitting for an hour a day or so just on my own. I was 20 or so and, essentially, I was just sitting cross-legged, thinking. It\u2019s so hard to notice that you\u2019re lost in thought that, by tendency, you\u2019re just not going to notice it. And so, in the beginning, people think that they\u2019re meditating and they\u2019re really just lost in thought. And it wasn\u2019t until I did my first ten-day vipassana retreat where I broke through and connected with the practice in a way where I realized, \u201cWow. All of that that has preceded this was really my thinking I was meditating and not meditating.\u201d And there are other landmarks along my journey that are like that \u2013 where it was a shift where I realized, \u201cWow. This what I thought was happening really was not happening as I thought it was,\u201d and that\u2019s a very common experience. And so, in the beginning, using a guided meditation can help cut through the chatter in a way that many people can\u2019t summon on their own. Tim Ferriss: Well, let me take a side step which is people ask me, \u201chat blogs do you read?\u201d and there really aren\u2019t many blogs that I read consistently aside from a handful. And partially, I read your blog and the posts you put up because they\u2019re like feature magazine articles in many cases. And there\u2019s one you wrote in 2011 called, \u201cDrugs and the Meaning of Life,\u201d and you\u2019ve written about this subject before. I have found certain hallucinogens, in particular, to be very therapeutically valuable for cutting through the chatter and turning that off, and bringing present state awareness to you in a very high definition way when used responsibly. And, of course, as you point out in this piece, it\u2019s not to say that everyone should take psychedelics but I\u2019d be curious to know \u2013 One of the lines here \u2013 that needs to be read in context, of course, but \u201cI have a daughter who will one day take drugs. Of course, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to see that she chooses her drugs wisely but a life without drugs is not foreseeable nor, I think, desirable.\u201d Then you obviously go through the how you might guide her to view these different subjects and one of the closing lines in this paragraph is, \u201cBut, if she doesn\u2019t not try a psychedelic like psilocybin\u00a0or LSD at least one in her adult life, I will worry that she may have missed one of important rites of passage a human being can experience.\u201d And I agree with this. I\u2019d be curious to hear what particular drugs or psychedelic substances you\u2019ve found most therapeutically valuable in your own life and how you suggest people think about this. Obviously, you have to put the potential legal ramifications in perspective, also, but what have you personally found most valuable and how so? Sam Harris: Yeah, well, again, you found another paragraph where I was happy to court controversy \u2013 to say that I\u2019ll be disappointed if my daughter doesn\u2019t drop acid. But the caveat here \u2013 and the caveat comes out several times in that piece \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Which everybody should read in full. I\u2019m not trying to pull anything out of context. I just don\u2019t want to read the whole thing to them now. Sam Harris: Yeah. I stand by every word but there are a lot of words in there and the caveat is that I have an increasingly healthy respect for what can go wrong on psychedelics and wrong in a way that I think has lasting consequences for people. And there\u2019s a lot that can go right with psychedelics and, to some degree, I think they\u2019re still indispensable for a lot of people \u2013 they certainly seem to be indispensable for me. I don\u2019t think I ever would have discovered meditation without having taken, in particular, MDMA, but MDMA, mushrooms, and LSD all played a role for me in unveiling an inner landscape that was worth exploring. But for that pharmacological advantage, I think my consciousness was such that I looked inside, I saw nothing of interest, and that\u2019s sort of the end of the conversation. You tell me that there\u2019s something profound to witness about the nature of my own mind \u2013 I don\u2019t see it. I just want to get on with the next thing in the world that seems fun to do or seems likely to lead to my success. I just was a skin-encapsulated ego that was just trying to get on with life and succeed and thought he was very clever and didn\u2019t have the contemplative tools to see much of anything when he paid attention. And that\u2019s a situation that many people are in and many smart people are in that position. So I\u2019m constantly meeting scientists, and philosophers, and highly articulate people who spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of the human mind and, when I talk to them about meditation or really any of these philosophical issues that, for which, an ability to pay attention to the nature of your own consciousness is an advantage. So something like free will or the nature of the self, of the possibility of self-transcendence \u2013 I\u2019m meeting people who have, as far as I can tell, no ability to notice their inner lives. There\u2019s people who, some of them seem to not to have inner lives but these are people who are very much the way I was when I was 18 before I had had any experience with any of this. There\u2019s just you\u2019re lost in thought, and you don\u2019t know it, and that phrase \u201clost in thought,\u201d means nothing to you, and you don\u2019t have the tools by which to do anything with it even if it meant something to you, and there\u2019s just nothing. And you\u2019re cognitively closed to data and the data are to be found \u2013 the most important point of which \u2013 is, the self you think you are is an illusion. This sense of being a self, riding around in your head, this feeling of \u201cI,\u201d this feeling that everyone calls \u201cI,\u201d is an illusion that can be disconfirmed in a variety of ways. Its boundaries can be transformed in ways or it can be completely cut through and vanish for a moment, or a minute, or potentially for the rest of one\u2019s life so it\u2019s vulnerable to inquiry. And that inquiry can take many forms but the unique power of psychedelics is that there\u2019s a unique power and a unique liability. The unique power and liability is that they are guaranteed to work in some way \u2013 and this is a point that Terence McKenna always made. Terence McKenna was a huge booster of psychedelics \u2013 and a very articulate one \u2013 and he poo-pooed any other spiritual methodology, meditation, and chanting, and yoga, and anything else that people brought to him saying, \u201cCan\u2019t you get the same benefit without drugs?\u201d And his point was, \u201cWell, you teach someone to meditate, you teach them yoga, there\u2019s no guarantee whatsoever that something\u2019s going to happen. They could spend a week doing it, they could spend a year doing it \u2013 who knows what\u2019s going to happen? They may just get bored and they\u2019re going to wander away from this thing not knowing that there was a \u201cthere\u201d there. If I give you five grams of mushrooms or 300 micrograms of LSD and tell you to sit on that couch for an hour, you are guaranteed to have a radical transformation in your experience. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are \u2013 this freight train of significance is going to come bearing down on you and we just have to watch the clock and know it\u2019s going to happen and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d So that\u2019s the advantage because you\u2019re guaranteed to realize, at the end of that episode, that it is possible to have a radically different experience than you tend to have. And, if you have a good experience, you\u2019re going realize that human life can be just unutterably sublime \u2013 that it\u2019s possible to feel at home in the universe in a way that you couldn\u2019t have previously imagined. But, if you have a bad experience \u2013 and the bad experiences are every bit as bad as the good experiences are good \u2013 you will have just this harrowing encounter with madness. And it\u2019s as pathological as any lunatic who\u2019s wandering the street raving to himself and completely cut off from others. You can have that experience and, hopefully, it goes away \u2013 and, universally, in every case, it does go away \u2013 but it\u2019s still rough and it still has consequences for people. Some of the consequences are good \u2013 I happen to think that it gives you a basis for compassion, in particular, for people who are suffering mental illness that you couldn\u2019t otherwise have but it\u2019s not an experience that I\u2019m eager to have again. So my healthy respect for the power of psychedelics has led me to not take many for many years. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve taken anything and my use tapered off in my 20s when I got into meditation and was spending more time on retreat and beginning to feel that I was hitting the center of the bullseye with meditation in a way that I was certainly not guaranteed to with psychedelics and I basically stopped using everything and just practiced meditation. But there\u2019s no question that I wouldn\u2019t have become sufficiently interested in meditation but for the experiences I had on LSD and MDMA in particular. [Music] Tim Ferriss: To round out this deep dive into meditation, I wanted to relive a conversation that I had with Rainn Wilson, who is perhaps best known as Dwight on NBC\u2019s Emmy Award-winning The Office. He shared an incredible insight to a very simple question we all face from time to time. [Music] When you feel overwhelmed, what do you do to improve the situation? Rainn Wilson: Well, I have a spiritual faith that I rely on that I use so I use prayer and meditation as tools to center me and bring me back into reality. I also find that, for me, acting is a wonderful escape because you get out of your own head and you get to go into someone else\u2019s head. And it was like that on The Office, too, and doing comedy. When life was good, and life was bad \u2013 there was something wonderful about coming to Dwight. And I could just put Rainn Wilson aside and just all of that bullshit, and clear it out of my head and out of my heart, and just be Dwight Shrute. And, sometimes, it was just super, super fun to do that. So those are some of the tools. Acting is a tool, prayer and meditation is a tool I use to bring myself into the world. Tim Ferriss: And your faith \u2013 I know I\u2019m going to massacre this because I\u2019ve only read it and not heard it said \u2013 but is it Baha\u2019i? Rainn Wilson: Yeah, Baha\u2019i. Tim Ferriss: Baha\u2019i. There we go. Thank you. Rainn Wilson: Baha\u2019i \u2013 like \u201cHi, how you doing?\u201d Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I want to come back to that but, when you meditate, what does that look like and do you do it on a daily basis? What\u2019s the format of that? Rainn Wilson: Yeah, I try and meditate every day. There\u2019s no format in the Baha\u2019i faith \u2013 it\u2019s just greatly encouraged to meditate. When you pray, you\u2019re communicating with the Creator, you\u2019re communicating with the universe, you\u2019re putting stuff out there, and, when you\u2019re meditating, you\u2019re listening to the universe. But it\u2019s really pretty simple. I get a great deal of benefit if I even do a 10-minute meditation and, out of that 10 minutes, if 4 of the minutes my mind can be very still and very silent. There\u2019s great guided meditations now. There\u2019s apps, there\u2019s all kinds of things you can do for meditation. But, for me, it\u2019s just about \u2013 I won\u2019t say silencing the mind because that\u2019s impossible because those thoughts are always going to pop up \u2013 but, when those thoughts pop up, you just notice them, you identify them, you let them float in front of your eyes almost like one of those old-fashioned Wall Street ticker machines. And you find\u2013 I find \u2013 a tremendous amount of peace, serenity, and bliss in just being in consciousness. And consciousness is not thought, consciousness is just being \u2013 \u201cI am this being. I am not separate from the giant being of earth, and the cosmos, and the universe.\u201d And just being in that stillness is incredibly rewarding. I get really a ton of clarity and I get a ton of energy from it. And these have been proven in scientific studies, by the way, in all kinds of things from healing trauma, to giving you more energy, to giving you more focus in your work. Meditation is a pretty incredible tool. Tim Ferriss: And lowering cortisol. I\u2019ve been spending time interacting with some researchers at Johns Hopkins \u2013 a gentleman named Roland Griffiths and also a gent named Adam Gazalley who runs a neuroimaging lab at UCSF. And what\u2019s been very interesting \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to go down the rabbit hole with this \u2013 but it appears that, if you look at experienced meditators and brain activity \u2013 And I\u2019m blanking on the particular area, I think it might be somewhere in the parietal lobe but I could be off. In any case, there\u2019s a portion of the brain that is thought to contribute to the separation of self and other. So it\u2019s inhibited both in the use of, say, psilocybin, which was found in magic mushrooms, but also you experience a similar type of pattern in experienced meditators which is kind of cool. [Crosstalk] Rainn Wilson: Well, I know that they \u2013 oh, sorry, go ahead Tim Ferriss: Go ahead. Rainn Wilson: Yeah, I heard a fascinating thing on the radio once where they did a study and they found the happiest man in the world. So they did a brain scan and they found the happiest person they could possibly find. And this guys was \u2013 I think he was an American, he was living in Wisconsin \u2013 but he was a student of Tibetan Buddhism. And, at the time when they did the brain scan \u2013 which charted out as the very happiest \u2013 he was in the process of meditating and it was a meditation of universal compassion so it\u2019s a meditation where you\u2019re feeling at one with everyone and great compassion for everyone on the planet earth and all beings on planet earth \u2013 human, animal, plant \u2013 what they\u2019re going through. And, in so doing, that achieved the greatest happiness. That goes along with what you\u2019re saying. Tim Ferriss: No, definitely. And, even if you are self-interested, there\u2019s a biological benefit to empathy, and compassion, and meditation. So I just want to reiterate something you said because I think it\u2019s so important is that I try to meditate 20 minutes each morning and, like you mentioned, there are apps like Calm and Headspace that are very helpful for this \u2013 but even if I\u2019m just violently, excuse me, let me try English again, violently getting punched in the psyche by my to-do list, and worries, and anxieties, and thoughts for 15, or even 18 minutes out of 20, if I have 2 minutes where the mud settles and the mind is clear, it has an incredible impact on the entire day for me. Rainn Wilson: I feel exactly the same way. That\u2019s exactly my experience. Even out of a 10-minute meditation, if I can just get two or three minutes in there where I have almost achieved thoughtlessness and just a serene bliss, it\u2019s like taking a powernap and it helps you through your whole day. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. And I think it was Tara Broch who said this to me \u2013 it might have been someone else \u2013 but they said, \u201cIf you just come back to your breath, or a mantra, or whatever it is that you\u2019re focusing on if you\u2019re doing concentrated meditation, it\u2019s the coming back that is the practice. So, if you\u2019re just distracted and you\u2019re basically just bouncing off the walls with your monkey mind for those 19 minutes, if you come back even once, you can consider it a successful session. And I think, for Type A personalities, that\u2019s really important to keep in mind. Rainn Wilson: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned something I\u2019d love to explore a little bit which is that acting can be a wonderful escape \u2013 and I\u2019m paraphrasing here \u2013 from your own head. I was actually watching Amy\u00a0yesterday \u2013 which is a documentary about Amy Winehouse and very sad story, tragic on many levels \u2013 but she produced some beautiful music from bad experiences and she was able to escape her own head by putting these poems which became songs on paper. Are there any particular exercises from whether it\u2019s acting school, or improv, or otherwise, that you think could benefit non-actors who just want to help create new avenues of thinking or embrace some type of therapeutic effect of getting outside their own head? Rainn Wilson: Yeah, specific ones, I suppose I could go into, but I studied with a great teacher at NYU named Paul Walker \u2013 he died of AIDS \u2013 but he was an exquisite teacher and he taught theater games. And, for me, that was a real revelation because, when I had tried acting early on, I was very stiff, and very in my head, and cerebral, and stuck, and it was very conscious like, \u201cHow am I going to say this line?\u201d and \u201cHow do I best look when I\u2019m turning this way?\u201d It was just a very self-conscious style of acting that was bad. It was sucky. So what Paul got us doing in acting school at NYU was just playing and there\u2019s something incredibly freeing about playing like a kid and that your impulses as an actor and your impulses as a kid at play are really the same thing. Like I said before, it\u2019s deeply pretending. So are there specific exercises? I suppose I could think of some but how much fun is it to play \u201cRed Light, Green Light\u201d for 20 minutes or \u201cDuck, Duck, Goose,\u201d and then to move from those exercises into more and more imaginative improvisations but where you allow yourself to just play like a child. And, sometimes, children play and they\u2019re competitive, sometimes, they play and they\u2019re very serious \u2013 it\u2019s not all this general, \u201cWhee,\u201d stuff. And I found that so freeing and it was the key for me as an actor that broke me open, and got me out of my head, and just got me in my body, and in that place of pure imagination and spontaneity that you really want as an actor. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. And I think it seems to me, also, when you put yourself in that place \u2013 much like meditation, you have to be present state aware. You can\u2019t be worrying about something that you have scheduled two weeks in the future or resenting something like some idiot who cut you off in traffic that morning. You have to be in that moment, and be effective, and to have fun. You just can\u2019t be distracted by those things. Rainn Wilson: Yeah, like we\u2019ll do a thing where you \u2013 I just remember because I did it recently where I did sessions with the employees at Soul Pancake, games and improv stuff \u2013 where everyone has a number from 1 to 10. There\u2019s two teams of ten on each side of the room. There\u2019s a stool in the center of the room with a shoe on it and the goal is you\u2019ve got to get the shoe and then get back to your place in line. Right? It\u2019s a pretty simple game. But then you also do this game called, \u201cSexy Nostril,\u201d where you write down adjectives and you write down body parts so it could be \u201cangry,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d \u201clonely,\u201d \u201cenergetic\u201d \u2013 those are the adjectives and then body parts, \u201cearlobe,\u201d \u201ctesticle,\u201d \u201canus,\u201d \u201cshoulder blade,\u201d \u201cfingernail,\u201d whatever. And you draw one of each and then you try and play a game manifesting those characteristics. So, if you have \u201csexy nostril,\u201d then you have to play that same game of getting the shoe and getting back in line but you\u2019re a person where the center of their energy is in their nostril and it\u2019s a very sensual, sexual energy. And it helps you create a character and play as that character, and it takes you out of your head and it just gets you in your body and gets you feeling and responding. I love teaching that stuff. It\u2019s super fun. And, for me, Tim, I\u2019m in my head a lot and it kind of sucks. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah, me, too. [Crosstalk] Rainn Wilson: So there\u2019s certain tools that I have to use to get by. So I\u2019ve learned in my life \u2013 I don\u2019t remember every day \u2013 but there\u2019s certain things I have to do to just be out of my head and just to get to normal. I\u2019m not talking about being really super effective. Just to get to normal, I have to do meditation. I have to do some exercise. If I can get into nature, great. If I can play some tennis, better. And acting is that same way \u2013 acting, rehearsing, playing characters \u2013 these are the things that get me out of my head and out of just analyzing every goddamn thing that comes down the pike and leaves me miserable and making really bad choices. Tim Ferriss: Well, there you have it, folks \u2013 my first episode of the Tim Ferriss Radio Hour with some of the superstars, some of the experts that I\u2019ve spoken to over the past few years. And this is an experiment, as I said at the top of the show. I want to know what did you like? What did you not like? How can it be improved? Do you want more of these or should we just skip it? That\u2019s totally fair as well. What topics would you like me to most explore or consolidate? What types of patterns? In other words, I just want your feedback so please let me know what did you like, what didn\u2019t you like, what should I do more of, less of? And you can ping me on Twitter, @TFerriss \u2013 T-F-E-R-R-I-S-S \u2013 or on the blog at fourhourworkweek.com/blog. If you\u2019re a Facebooker \u2013 you love the Facebooks \u2013 you could go to facebook.com/timferriss with two \u201cr\u2019s\u201d and two \u201cs\u2019s\u201d but, generally speaking, Twitter is going to be the best means of communication for now \u2013 @TFerriss. So please let me know your thoughts and, as always and until next time, thank you for listening.

and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show where it is always my job to deconstruct world-class performers to tease out the habits, routines, tactics, breakfasts \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 that you can then emulate, apply to your own life, test yourself, favorite books, whatever it might be", "this particular episode, i\u2019m going to try to do one better", "i\u2019m excited to bring you a little sample taste test of a new show format that i\u2019m working on", "and this isn\u2019t going to displace the other \u2013 it\u2019s just to complement it", "and i\u2019m calling it, for lack of a better name, for the time being, \u201cthe tim ferriss radio hour,\u201d and you\u2019ll see where this is going", "and, after nearly 200 hours of conversations with world-class performers all over the map, including people like arnold schwarzenegger, jamie foxx, tony robbins, maria popova, peter thiel, marc andreessen, amanda palmer, malcolm gladwell, rick rubin, reid hoffman, and so many more, you start to spot patterns or at least, when i\u2019m reviewing all of the transcripts, i spot patterns", "sometimes they\u2019re months apart but these are the shared habits, philosophies, tools, and more that are the common thread or the common threat", "and this is the premise, of course, of my new book, tools of titans, which is a compilation of all of my favorite patterns, all of my favorite routines \u2013 you can check that out everywhere \u2013 but that\u2019s also where \u201cthe tim ferriss radio hour\u201d comes in", "in each episode, we\u2019ll take a deep dive into one specific topic or tactic, bringing together the collective genius of past guests to help you, hopefully, become world-class in your own right if you aren\u2019t already", "at the very least, it will give you a common thread, as i mentioned, with slight tweaks here and there that you can customize, in effect, to your idiosyncrasies \u2013 to your own personality \u2013 or you can blend them together", "and, today, in this sneak peek episode, we will be exploring meditation", "meditation, or practicing mindfulness, is by far the most common pattern across them all", "in this episode, for instance, i ask chase jarvis to explain his top priorities for feeling fulfilled", "i\u2019ve found sort of a new passion for sleep", "i can\u2019t ever \u2013 not never \u2013 but i rarely get the eight, nine, ten \u2013\u201d i talk tm \u2013 that\u2019s transcendental meditation \u2013 with the terminator, the governator, arnold schwarzenegger", "i would say within 14 days, 3 weeks, i got to the point where i could really disconnect my mind and also learn how to focus more and to calm down", "i cover a wide spectrum with sam harris and talk about everything \u2013 or ask him about everything from hallucinogens to meditation techniques", "the unique power of psychedelics is that they are guaranteed to work in some way", "and then i wrap up with rainn wilson discussing how to handle life when you feel overwhelmed \u2013 and we all end up, at points, feeling overwhelmed or, at the very least, unclear", "it was the key for me as an actor that kind of broke me open and got me out of my head and just got me in my body and in that place of kind of pure imagination and spontaneity that you really want as an actor", "we start our deep dive on meditation with chase jarvis, ceo of creativelive which is an online learning platform that broadcasts live, of course, high-definition classes to more than 10 million students in 200 plus countries", "chase was also the youngest person ever to be named a hasselblad master, nikon master, and asmp master", "he has photographed for nike, apple, columbia sportswear, rei, honda, subaru, polaroid, lady gaga, red bull, and many more", "he\u2019s one of the most successful commercial photographers on the planet", "so, without further ado, let\u2019s jump into the first episode of \u201cthe tim ferriss radio hour.\u201d

less", "health", "hmm", "yeah", "one\u2019s health and being active is incredibly valuable", "and i feel like and old person saying this next one but sleep", "i have lived on four to six hours of sleep for the last ten years so just prioritizing sleep", "and the third one is meditation", "meditation is \u2013 [crosstalk] oh, yeah", "we haven\u2019t talked about this in a while", "aha", "you were on it for a good bit and you said you felt \u2013 [crosstalk] i was", "i fell off the wagon but, yeah, you were one of two people that i credit with finally kicking me in the ass to take it seriously", "it has really been a good thing \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah, specifically tm", "so transcendental meditation for those who don\u2019t know \u2013 or trademark", "yeah", "but i have my issues with almost every form of meditation", "there are pros and cons \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about them before \u2013 but tell me about your meditation practice", "my meditation practice is not perfect and none are", "i just sit down between 15 and 20 minutes twice a day", "sometimes, i only get one time a day, sometimes, those are a little compressed or shit happens \u2013 you\u2019re on an airplane and the captain comes on and pulls you out of it \u2013 or whatever", "but i make a conscious effort to just observe my thoughts and practice tm in the morning and the evening before dinner and it has made \u2013 the analogy that i can most simply put here on your show is it\u2019s when you\u2019re in the zone \u2013 say, playing sports or playing music \u2013 and things just seem effortless", "it\u2019s called a \u201cflow state.\u201d steven kotler\u2019s new book \u2013 which is a good book, the rise of superman, check that out, a little plug for his book about creativity and flow states \u2013 but that sense of flow, it\u2019s when things sort of happen in slow motion", "now, you\u2019re not literally talking in slow motion but you have the same clarity as if you\u2019re going through life and everything\u2019s happening in slow motion", "instead of that, \u201ci\u2019m hyper-caffeinated, my boss is \u2013\u201d [crosstalk] \u201ci\u2019m agitated and reactive \u2013 dodging bullets\u201d [crosstalk] yeah", "\u201cahhhh.\u201d instead, you\u2019re just like, \u201ci\u2019m driving the bus here and we\u2019re going to go here, and then i\u2019m going to do this.\u201d and there\u2019s this certain clarity it\u2019s like magic", "it\u2019s really weird", "and there\u2019s one other thing \u2013 i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve felt this, tim, but it sort of aggregates so you get a good benefit from one, two, three, four, then when you\u2019re on a roll, there\u2019s this sort of exponential \u2013 there\u2019s a sort of overdrive \u2013 and it\u2019s like, \u201coh my gosh, i feel like i\u2019m just floating.\u201d yeah", "i can\u2019t explain it, either but, for me \u2013 and just for those people who might be thinking like i did for my entire life \u2013 \u201cbullshit.\u201d yeah, \u201cbullshit.\u201d no, \u201ci don\u2019t want people \u2018ohm-ing\u2019 me in fricking all this \u2013\u201d yeah, yeah, yeah", "chakra, whatever", "i\u2019m not into it", "especially living in san francisco, i\u2019ve developed an allergy to sanctimonious \u2013 and i\u2019ve been to burning man \u2013 but sanctimonious burner types who want to lecture me about chakras", "i\u2019m just like, \u201chonestly, please, i can\u2019t handle another minute of this.\u201d so i\u2019ve had this aversion to meditation but, when it\u2019s very sort of non-dogmatic \u2013 where it\u2019s like, look, you\u2019re not trying to control anything, you\u2019re not trying to think of a candle flame \u2013 just observe your thoughts and be okay with them and sit with good posture for a period of time, that\u2019s it", "even if you think it\u2019s a shitty job and you\u2019re running through your to-do list or thinking of the stock market, that\u2019s okay", "just make it part of your routine", "and what i found was \u2013 and some well-known people who do tm are like paul mccartney or ariana huffington \u2013 david lynch", "david lynch", "i\u2019m blanking on his name for some reason but bridgewater capital \u2013 largest hedge fund in, if not the world, the united states", "$100 billion plus", "[crosstalk] russell simmons", "[crosstalk] ray dalio", "russell simmons", "the list is \u2013 i think howard stern \u2013 it\u2019s crazy", "[crosstalk] the list is pretty amazing, yes", "jerry seinfeld", "and the physiological or psychological effects are so fascinating, like you said, because you\u2019ll do it for a couple of days and you\u2019re like, \u201cwell, yeah, okay, whatever,\u201d and then you hit \u2013 [crosstalk] i\u2019m sleepy", "[crosstalk] you hit this sort of inflection point where you just drop from 200 rpms to 150 and you\u2019re like, \u201cwhoa, okay, this is different,\u201d and then, the whole week, you\u2019re kind of zenned out and then, after, say, a four-week period \u2013 and i did my first retreat a few months ago before i volunteered for the masochism that is television production", "[crosstalk] i could just hit you with a stick for a couple weeks", "[crosstalk] yeah, if you could put a nail through it first, that\u2019d be great", "sure", "but really had this tremendous effect on me that, oddly enough \u2013 and maybe this is getting too out there for some people \u2013 but very similar to my experiences post-relatively high dose hallucinogens", "this extended period of calm \u2013 [crosstalk] grace", "yes", "[crosstalk] or ease in decision making \u2013 uncluttered", "like you closed every browser on your computer, and turned off the antivirus, and rebooted the whole thing \u2013 that type of feeling", "so i did fall of the train", "question for you \u2013 because, the morning session, i usually find pretty easy", "afternoon, what do you do", "[crosstalk] yeah", "afternoon\u2019s hard", "i\u2019m right now thinking of, \u201cokay, i\u2019ve got to go from here to the thing, to the thing", "alright, when am i going to get my thing in", "oh, shit.\u201d yeah, sometimes i\u2019ll try to do it in the car \u2013 like uber or whatever", "[crosstalk] that\u2019s not bad", "[crosstalk] but when do you typically do it in the afternoon", "i\u2019m curious", "i try and do it before dinner sometime \u2013 between work and dinner", "we\u2019re entrepreneurs, we work \u2013 it\u2019s tough \u2013 crazy long hours so i\u2019ll take it whenever i can get it", "and it\u2019s usually a little less gracious than my morning one", "like you said, it\u2019s like morning is like it\u2019s your time, you carve out 20 minutes", "so, my afternoon one is often a little bit more piecemeal", "but, again, it\u2019s the act \u2013 i try not to judge the practice \u2013 the practice is the practice", "yeah", "when you meditate, are you sitting cross-legged, are you sitting with your feet on the floor", "i try to sit in a comfortable chair with my feet flat on the floor, hands on my lap", "and there\u2019s a mantra \u2013 if you learn tm, you\u2019re given a mantra \u2013 and say that word over and over", "and, if some thoughts come in, you\u2019re like, \u201coh, there\u2019s those thoughts", "bye,\u201d and then they go away and you keep doing it over again", "and then, sometimes, like, \u201coh my god, that was 25 minutes,\u201d and, sometimes, it\u2019s like, \u201coh my god, that was one minute", "it felt like a week.\u201d and, again, but just not judging that and \u2013 and it\u2019s \u2013 without continuing to talk about it because now it\u2019s getting weird because we\u2019re talking about it so much \u2013 but it\u2019s just a powerful tool that is so simple", "i\u2019m just mind melding while you\u2019re talking", "that\u2019s great", "you\u2019re meditating", "you\u2019re staring off into space", "[crosstalk] i haven\u2019t been listening to you", "for the last 20 minutes, i haven\u2019t been listening \u2013 [crosstalk] for the listening people, tim is staring off into space right now", "he\u2019s not paying attention to us", "okay", "that is, i think, a huge takeaway for people that it doesn\u2019t have to be tm \u2013 it could be vipassana, anything", "building in a pause, just like a warm bath for your brain, even if it\u2019s ten minutes a day, so that you\u2019re not in a reactive mode \u2013 it\u2019s really a game changer", "and, physiologically, had a lot of effects for me, as well", "[crosstalk] oh, yeah", "the studies are crazy", "[crosstalk] so, when my cortisol levels dropped \u2013 i was able to lose body fat more easily in my abdomen, for instance", "really became very sensitive to alcohol and caffeine so i dropped them both significantly \u2013 not because i was getting judgmental about it but because i was over sensitized to it", "i\u2019d grown immune to the effects so i could have six cups of coffee a day and be like, \u201ceh,\u201d and did tm for four or five weeks and it was like i had one cup and i was like, \u201cwow.\u201d i didn\u2019t realize what my baseline was", "so just maybe to \u2013 [crosstalk] it makes you a cheap date, by the way, too", "i\u2019ve always been a cheap date", "[music] so, with that, i thought you might like to know about some of my current meditation routines or how i\u2019m incorporating mindfulness into my day", "first and foremost, upon waking, there are a few things that i do", "i get up, generally take a cold shower, do some wim hoff breathing \u2013 which is a whole separate podcast \u2013 and make my bed, etc", "i have my five things that i do in the morning \u2013 there\u2019s a separate episode on this \u2013 but the meditation comes in right after i\u2019ve set the kettle to boil some water or get it to 185 for tea", "i sit down, i do 21 minutes of transcendental meditation although i should 20 minutes of meditation", "the first minute is really just to allow myself to fidget and get settled", "i\u2019m sitting on the couch in an effectively half lotus position \u2013 i don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at all, you could sit with your feet on the floor \u2013 i just happen to be comfortable that way", "and for the first few minutes, i\u2019m actually mimicking the format of headspace, the app, in many ways", "i\u2019m really focusing on what is happening already \u2013 the sensations of, say, my legs against the couch, the feeling of my breathing \u2013 and you could look at it as a form, in some sense, of vipassana meditation", "then i segway into the mantra-based tm", "that is simply what i\u2019ve found to work well for me, and, oddly enough, it seems that a high percentage of men gravitate, ultimately, towards tm and high percentage of women gravitate towards vipassana", "that is not true across the board at all", "sam harris, for instance, practices a number of types of meditation, none of which are tm", "now, another guest who i asked about meditation was arnold schwarzenegger, the 30th governor of california, seven-time mr", "olympia", "and something, perhaps, a lot of people don\u2019t know, he was a golden globe winner in 1976 for his role in stay hungry\u00a0with jeff bridges and sally fields", "he has done everything \u2013 he\u2019s reinvented himself over and over again", "and the other place that you might find mindfulness in my life is where arnold also has it which is in the gym", "if we\u2019re trying to cultivate present state awareness and less reactivity, you don\u2019t have to sit down and think of a mantra to do it \u2013 there are multiple ways", "so that all having been said, here we go delving into meditation with no other than arnold schwarzenegger", "[music] i\u2019ve heard you mention transcendental meditation in passing, briefly", "do you meditate", "i don\u2019t meditate now but i got heavily into it in the \u201970s and i remember there was a time in my life where i felt like everything\u2019s just coming together and i did not find a way \u2013 or couldn\u2019t find a way \u2013 of keeping the things separate", "so it was always when i was thinking about it at the same time \u2013 i was thinking about my body building career, i was thinking about my movie career, i was thinking about the documentary pumping iron\u00a0that we\u2019re shooting right now and the movie stay hungry\u00a0that we just finished shooting, and my investment in the apartment building, do we get the financing from the bank \u2013 and all of this kind of stuff was always coming together and, at the same time, i was training for the mr", "olympia competition in south africa", "and i was training right here at gold\u2019s gym and i remember there was all the camera equipment around 5 hours a day in my face and then someone, in the middle of squatting, was trying to change the batter pack on my lifting belt and all this stuff", "so, yeah, eventually, i felt like, \u201ci\u2019ve got to do something about it because i have such great opportunities here and everything is happening, and everything is going my way, but i\u2019m just clustering everything into one big problem rather than separating it out, and having calm, and peace, and being happy.\u201d and so, in a total coincidence, i ran into this guy that i\u2019ve run into many times on the beach \u2013 very, very pleasant man \u2013 who told me that he\u2019s a teacher in transcendental meditation and i said, \u201cwell, it\u2019s interesting you mention it because i feel like i should do something because i feel like i\u2019m just overly worried and have anxieties and all this stuff", "and i feel certain pressures that i have never felt before.\u201d and then he says, \u201coh, arnold, it\u2019s not uncommon", "it\u2019s very common", "a lot of people go through this", "this is why people use meditation", "transcendental meditation is one way of dealing with problem.\u201d and he was very good in selling it because he didn\u2019t say it\u2019s the only answer \u2013 he just said, \u201cit\u2019s one of many.\u201d and he says, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you try it", "i\u2019m a teacher there up in westwood", "i would not be able to teach you since we are friends but there will be another teacher that will give you a mantra and blah, blah, blah, and teach you how to do it", "and then i can help you after that,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause i will be teaching, obviously", "why don\u2019t you come up on thursday", "and i will be there", "i will introduce you to the folks up there.\u201d and so i went up there, took a class, and i went home after that and then tried it", "i said, \u201cwell, i\u2019ve got to give it a shot,\u201d and i did 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes at night", "and i would say, within 14 days, three weeks, i got to the point where i really could disconnect my mind and, as they say, to find a few seconds of this connection and rejuvenate the mind and also learn how to focus more and to calm down", "and i saw the effect right away that i was much more calm about all of the challenges that were facing me and i continued doing that, then, for a year", "and, by that time, i felt like, \u201ci think that i\u2019ve mastered this", "i think that now i don\u2019t feel overwhelmed anymore.\u201d and i really felt it one of the things where, in the transcendental meditation was anxiety and pressure meeting around the corner tranquility", "this is what it felt like", "and so i was happy from that point and, even today, i still benefit from that because i don\u2019t merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem \u2013 i take on one challenge at a time", "and, when i go and i study my script for a movie, then, that day \u2013 when i study my script for a movie \u2013 i don\u2019t let anything else interfere in that", "i just concentrate on that", "and the other thing that i\u2019ve learned is that there\u2019s many forms of meditation because, when i study and i work really hard \u2013 it takes the ultimate amount of concentration \u2013 i can only do it for 45 minutes, maybe \u2013 maybe an hour", "but then i have to run off and maybe play chess", "and i play chess for 15 minutes and then i can go back and have all the energy in the world again and jump right back and then continue on with my work as if i\u2019ve not done it at all today", "right", "it\u2019s like i\u2019m fresh", "and so that\u2019s another way i think of meditation", "and then i also figured out that i could use my workouts as a form of meditation because i concentrate so much on the muscle and i have my mind inside the bicep when i do my curls", "i have my mind inside the pectoral muscles when i do my bench press", "so i\u2019m really inside and it\u2019s like a form of meditation because you have no chance of thinking or concentrating on anything else at that time but just that training that you do", "and so there\u2019s many ways of meditation and i benefit from all of those and i\u2019m, today, much calmer, and much more organized, and much more tranquil because of that", "this whole conversation makes me want to go tackle the world", "i love it", "[music] next, i want to reintroduce one of my most popular and controversial guests, sam harris", "he is brilliant", "sam has a ph.d", "in neuroscience and the author of many best-selling books including, the end of faith, freewill, lyin, and waking up", "our first conversation on this podcast explored science, different types of meditation and the uses and risks of psychedelics among many other things and that conversation included segments such as this", "[music] there\u2019s a quote here that is, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing irrational about seeking the states of mind that lie at the core of many religions: compassion, awe and devotion, feelings of oneness are surely among the most valuable experiences a person can have.\u201d assuming that\u2019s true \u2013 and you and i have, of course, talked about altered states and you\u2019ve written about altered states \u2013 i\u2019d love to just dig into that expression or that quote, rather, and look at the alternate approaches that you\u2019ve perhaps explored or researched related to achieving some of these valuable states", "mm-hmm", "yeah", "so, in the beginning of my career, as you point out, i spent a lot of time criticizing religion and criticizing it for its obvious harms", "but one of its harms that\u2019s not so obvious is that it keeps us talking about this positive end of human experience \u2013 this self-transcendence and highly normative states of consciousness in first century or seventh century terms and most people, most of the time, think that the only way to capture \u201cspiritual experience\u201d \u2013 and one\u2019s interest in it and the ways in which one would explore it \u2013 is to, to some degree, indulge the myth-intoxicated language of the iron age", "there\u2019s just no way to talk about it otherwise", "science hasn\u2019t given us the tools to talk about it, secular tools doesn\u2019t give us the tools to talk about it, and so we\u2019re left talking about being christians, and muslims, and jews, and buddhists and organize our lives around the really incompatible truth claims and doctrines that you find in those religions and very smart people who are secular in every other way think there\u2019s just no alternative to that and so one of my main interests now is in articulating an alternative because, clearly, there are extraordinary experiences that people have and many of these experiences do lie at the core of many of our religions", "and so, to take jesus as an obvious example \u2013 who knows who jesus actually was and what is historically true in the new testament", "but let\u2019s just say, for our argument\u2019s sake, that there really was a guy who loved his neighbor as himself and had this extraordinarily charismatic effect on the people around him, and bore witness to this possibility of a radical self-transcendence", "well, clearly, whatever\u2019s true there is deeper than christianity and it\u2019s not reducible to christianity", "in fact, christianity has to be a distortion of that truth and we know this because jesus isn\u2019t the only person who\u2019s had that experience", "there\u2019s the buddha and then countless contemplatives through the ages can attest to this experience of, for lack of a better phrase, unconditional love and that has some relationship to what i would call self-transcendence which i think is even more important", "and so there\u2019s this phenomenon that\u2019s clearly deeper than any of our provincial ways of talking about it in the context of religion", "and so there\u2019s a deeper truth of human psychology and the nature of consciousness and i think we need to explore it in terms that don\u2019t require that we lie to ourselves or to our children about the nature of reality and that we don\u2019t indulge this divisive language of picking teams in the contest among religions", "so, yeah, my next book that\u2019s coming out in the fall is called waking up: a guide to spirituality without religion\u00a0and it\u2019s about the phenomenon of self-transcendence and the ways in which people can explore it without believing anything on insufficient evidence", "and one of the principal ways is various techniques of meditation \u2013 mindfulness being, i think, the most useful one to adopt first", "there\u2019s also the use of psychedelic drugs which is not quite the same as meditation but it does, if nothing else, it reveals that the human nervous system is plastic in a very important way which means your experience of the world can be very radically transformed", "you are tending to be who you were yesterday by virtue of various habit patterns and physiological homeostasis and other things that are keeping you very recognizable to yourself but it\u2019s possible to have a very different experience", "and it\u2019s possible to do that through pharmacology, it\u2019s possible to do that through some kind of crisis or it\u2019s possible to do it through a deliberate form of training like meditation", "and i think it\u2019s crucial to do because we all want to be as happy, and as fulfilled, or as free of pain and suffering as we can possibly be and all of our suffering and all of our unhappiness is a product of how our minds are in every moment", "and so, if there\u2019s a way to use the mind itself to improve one\u2019s capacity for moment-to-moment well-being \u2013 which i\u2019m convinced there is \u2013 then this should be potentially of interest to everybody", "so a couple of quick questions on all of the subjects", "so the first i\u2019d like to touch on, meditation \u2013 i think we can probably touch on this briefly \u2013 is something we\u2019ve discussed before", "you, along with many other people who are high performers in their respective fields have recommended meditation so i have been meditating, partially in thanks to your influence for some time now", "is it safe to say that the meditation that you most frequently recommend to novices is vipassana meditation or is that \u2013", "yeah", "okay", "got it", "why is that", "i\u2019ve experimented with a number of different types \u2013 transcendental meditation, vipassana, of course, and have taken a number of courses \u2013 why that selection", "why that choice", "yeah, it has a few obvious strengths that are actually not shared by any other technique i know of", "the first is that it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it needn\u2019t \u2013 presuppose any belief about anything", "you don\u2019t have to develop a fondness for the iconography of buddhism", "you don\u2019t have to care about the buddha", "you don\u2019t have to believe in rebirth, or karma \u2013 none of the doctrine of buddhism need be adopted in order to get the practice off the ground and never need be adopted if it never makes any sense which much of it doesn\u2019t", "you don\u2019t have to become a buddhist to do this and you don\u2019t have to add anything strategically to your experience as a mechanism by which to meditate", "so you\u2019re not adding a mantra, you\u2019re not visualizing something that isn\u2019t there", "you don\u2019t have to look at a candle flame or do anything to your environment by way of artifice to create the circumstance of meditation", "all you\u2019re doing is paying exquisitely close and non-judgmental attention to whatever you\u2019re experiencing anyway", "and the first technique you use to be able to train that capacity is to focus on your breath which you always have with you and is just an easy objective to focus on", "but it doesn\u2019t even have to be the breath \u2013 mindfulness is just that quality of mind which allows you to pay attention to sights, and sounds, and sensations, and even thought themselves without being lost in thought and without grasping it was pleasant and pushing what is an unpleasant away", "so, just being wide open to the next sensory or emotional experience that comes careening into consciousness \u2013 that is mindfulness", "and so, in some sense, it\u2019s not even a practice, it\u2019s just the state of not being distracted and being aware", "and it feels like a practice in the beginning because it\u2019s hard to do \u2013 we\u2019re so deeply conditioned to be lost in thought and to be having this conversation with ourselves from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep", "it just chatter in the mind and we\u2019re so captivated that we\u2019re not even aware of it", "we are essentially in a dream state and it\u2019s through this veil of thought that we go about our day and perceive our environments but we are just talking to ourselves non-stop and, until you can break that spell and begin to notice thoughts, themselves, as objects of consciousness just arising and passing away, you can\u2019t even pay attention to your breath or anything else with any kind of clarity", "and so, initially, you have to develop some concentration and get mindfulness in-depth so that you can pay attention but, once you can pay attention, it doesn\u2019t matter what you pay attention to", "there\u2019s nothing, in principle, that is outside the meditation process", "there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s, in principle, that\u2019s a distraction", "you don\u2019t need a quiet environment \u2013 you can have loud construction noises going across the street and it\u2019s just as good of circumstance for meditation as anything else", "and those are the main reasons why i think it\u2019s the, in terms of being designed for export outside of buddhist culture or religious culture, generally, and becoming a tool for our intellectual lives in a secular, scientific context, i think there\u2019s nothing like it", "what resources would you suggest for someone who wants to try to educate themselves or dive in as a novice in terms of books, resources, websites for mindfulness and meditation", "yeah", "well, i give a few on my blog", "i wrote an article a couple years ago entitled, \u201chow to meditate,\u201d and, if people google that, they\u2019ll see that i link to a few books and i tell people where they can go on retreats and i briefly describe the practice", "i also have given a couple of guided mindfulness meditations i\u2019ve put on soundcloud which are on my website as well", "and there are other guided meditations out there that people can use", "and, in the beginning, some people find that very helpful to have somebody\u2019s voice essentially reminding them to not be lost in thought every few seconds", "because what happens in the beginning for people \u2013 and this happened to me in my practice for at least a year \u2013 i think it was a year before i went on intensive silent retreat", "i was just sitting for an hour a day or so just on my own", "i was 20 or so and, essentially, i was just sitting cross-legged, thinking", "it\u2019s so hard to notice that you\u2019re lost in thought that, by tendency, you\u2019re just not going to notice it", "and so, in the beginning, people think that they\u2019re meditating and they\u2019re really just lost in thought", "and it wasn\u2019t until i did my first ten-day vipassana retreat where i broke through and connected with the practice in a way where i realized, \u201cwow", "all of that that has preceded this was really my thinking i was meditating and not meditating.\u201d and there are other landmarks along my journey that are like that \u2013 where it was a shift where i realized, \u201cwow", "this what i thought was happening really was not happening as i thought it was,\u201d and that\u2019s a very common experience", "and so, in the beginning, using a guided meditation can help cut through the chatter in a way that many people can\u2019t summon on their own", "well, let me take a side step which is people ask me, \u201chat blogs do you read?\u201d and there really aren\u2019t many blogs that i read consistently aside from a handful", "and partially, i read your blog and the posts you put up because they\u2019re like feature magazine articles in many cases", "and there\u2019s one you wrote in 2011 called, \u201cdrugs and the meaning of life,\u201d and you\u2019ve written about this subject before", "i have found certain hallucinogens, in particular, to be very therapeutically valuable for cutting through the chatter and turning that off, and bringing present state awareness to you in a very high definition way when used responsibly", "and, of course, as you point out in this piece, it\u2019s not to say that everyone should take psychedelics but i\u2019d be curious to know \u2013 one of the lines here \u2013 that needs to be read in context, of course, but \u201ci have a daughter who will one day take drugs", "of course, i\u2019ll do everything in my power to see that she chooses her drugs wisely but a life without drugs is not foreseeable nor, i think, desirable.\u201d then you obviously go through the how you might guide her to view these different subjects and one of the closing lines in this paragraph is, \u201cbut, if she doesn\u2019t not try a psychedelic like psilocybin\u00a0or lsd at least one in her adult life, i will worry that she may have missed one of important rites of passage a human being can experience.\u201d and i agree with this", "i\u2019d be curious to hear what particular drugs or psychedelic substances you\u2019ve found most therapeutically valuable in your own life and how you suggest people think about this", "obviously, you have to put the potential legal ramifications in perspective, also, but what have you personally found most valuable and how so", "yeah, well, again, you found another paragraph where i was happy to court controversy \u2013 to say that i\u2019ll be disappointed if my daughter doesn\u2019t drop acid", "but the caveat here \u2013 and the caveat comes out several times in that piece \u2013 which everybody should read in full", "i\u2019m not trying to pull anything out of context", "i just don\u2019t want to read the whole thing to them now", "yeah", "i stand by every word but there are a lot of words in there and the caveat is that i have an increasingly healthy respect for what can go wrong on psychedelics and wrong in a way that i think has lasting consequences for people", "and there\u2019s a lot that can go right with psychedelics and, to some degree, i think they\u2019re still indispensable for a lot of people \u2013 they certainly seem to be indispensable for me", "i don\u2019t think i ever would have discovered meditation without having taken, in particular, mdma, but mdma, mushrooms, and lsd all played a role for me in unveiling an inner landscape that was worth exploring", "but for that pharmacological advantage, i think my consciousness was such that i looked inside, i saw nothing of interest, and that\u2019s sort of the end of the conversation", "you tell me that there\u2019s something profound to witness about the nature of my own mind \u2013 i don\u2019t see it", "i just want to get on with the next thing in the world that seems fun to do or seems likely to lead to my success", "i just was a skin-encapsulated ego that was just trying to get on with life and succeed and thought he was very clever and didn\u2019t have the contemplative tools to see much of anything when he paid attention", "and that\u2019s a situation that many people are in and many smart people are in that position", "so i\u2019m constantly meeting scientists, and philosophers, and highly articulate people who spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of the human mind and, when i talk to them about meditation or really any of these philosophical issues that, for which, an ability to pay attention to the nature of your own consciousness is an advantage", "so something like free will or the nature of the self, of the possibility of self-transcendence \u2013 i\u2019m meeting people who have, as far as i can tell, no ability to notice their inner lives", "there\u2019s people who, some of them seem to not to have inner lives but these are people who are very much the way i was when i was 18 before i had had any experience with any of this", "there\u2019s just you\u2019re lost in thought, and you don\u2019t know it, and that phrase \u201clost in thought,\u201d means nothing to you, and you don\u2019t have the tools by which to do anything with it even if it meant something to you, and there\u2019s just nothing", "and you\u2019re cognitively closed to data and the data are to be found \u2013 the most important point of which \u2013 is, the self you think you are is an illusion", "this sense of being a self, riding around in your head, this feeling of \u201ci,\u201d this feeling that everyone calls \u201ci,\u201d is an illusion that can be disconfirmed in a variety of ways", "its boundaries can be transformed in ways or it can be completely cut through and vanish for a moment, or a minute, or potentially for the rest of one\u2019s life so it\u2019s vulnerable to inquiry", "and that inquiry can take many forms but the unique power of psychedelics is that there\u2019s a unique power and a unique liability", "the unique power and liability is that they are guaranteed to work in some way \u2013 and this is a point that terence mckenna always made", "terence mckenna was a huge booster of psychedelics \u2013 and a very articulate one \u2013 and he poo-pooed any other spiritual methodology, meditation, and chanting, and yoga, and anything else that people brought to him saying, \u201ccan\u2019t you get the same benefit without drugs?\u201d and his point was, \u201cwell, you teach someone to meditate, you teach them yoga, there\u2019s no guarantee whatsoever that something\u2019s going to happen", "they could spend a week doing it, they could spend a year doing it \u2013 who knows what\u2019s going to happen", "they may just get bored and they\u2019re going to wander away from this thing not knowing that there was a \u201cthere\u201d there", "if i give you five grams of mushrooms or 300 micrograms of lsd and tell you to sit on that couch for an hour, you are guaranteed to have a radical transformation in your experience", "it doesn\u2019t matter who you are \u2013 this freight train of significance is going to come bearing down on you and we just have to watch the clock and know it\u2019s going to happen and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d so that\u2019s the advantage because you\u2019re guaranteed to realize, at the end of that episode, that it is possible to have a radically different experience than you tend to have", "and, if you have a good experience, you\u2019re going realize that human life can be just unutterably sublime \u2013 that it\u2019s possible to feel at home in the universe in a way that you couldn\u2019t have previously imagined", "but, if you have a bad experience \u2013 and the bad experiences are every bit as bad as the good experiences are good \u2013 you will have just this harrowing encounter with madness", "and it\u2019s as pathological as any lunatic who\u2019s wandering the street raving to himself and completely cut off from others", "you can have that experience and, hopefully, it goes away \u2013 and, universally, in every case, it does go away \u2013 but it\u2019s still rough and it still has consequences for people", "some of the consequences are good \u2013 i happen to think that it gives you a basis for compassion, in particular, for people who are suffering mental illness that you couldn\u2019t otherwise have but it\u2019s not an experience that i\u2019m eager to have again", "so my healthy respect for the power of psychedelics has led me to not take many for many years", "it\u2019s been years since i\u2019ve taken anything and my use tapered off in my 20s when i got into meditation and was spending more time on retreat and beginning to feel that i was hitting the center of the bullseye with meditation in a way that i was certainly not guaranteed to with psychedelics and i basically stopped using everything and just practiced meditation", "but there\u2019s no question that i wouldn\u2019t have become sufficiently interested in meditation but for the experiences i had on lsd and mdma in particular", "[music] to round out this deep dive into meditation, i wanted to relive a conversation that i had with rainn wilson, who is perhaps best known as dwight on nbc\u2019s emmy award-winning the office", "he shared an incredible insight to a very simple question we all face from time to time", "[music] when you feel overwhelmed, what do you do to improve the situation", "well, i have a spiritual faith that i rely on that i use so i use prayer and meditation as tools to center me and bring me back into reality", "i also find that, for me, acting is a wonderful escape because you get out of your own head and you get to go into someone else\u2019s head", "and it was like that on the office, too, and doing comedy", "when life was good, and life was bad \u2013 there was something wonderful about coming to dwight", "and i could just put rainn wilson aside and just all of that bullshit, and clear it out of my head and out of my heart, and just be dwight shrute", "and, sometimes, it was just super, super fun to do that", "so those are some of the tools", "acting is a tool, prayer and meditation is a tool i use to bring myself into the world", "and your faith \u2013 i know i\u2019m going to massacre this because i\u2019ve only read it and not heard it said \u2013 but is it baha\u2019i", "yeah, baha\u2019i", "baha\u2019i", "there we go", "thank you", "baha\u2019i \u2013 like \u201chi, how you doing?\u201d yeah", "and i want to come back to that but, when you meditate, what does that look like and do you do it on a daily basis", "what\u2019s the format of that", "yeah, i try and meditate every day", "there\u2019s no format in the baha\u2019i faith \u2013 it\u2019s just greatly encouraged to meditate", "when you pray, you\u2019re communicating with the creator, you\u2019re communicating with the universe, you\u2019re putting stuff out there, and, when you\u2019re meditating, you\u2019re listening to the universe", "but it\u2019s really pretty simple", "i get a great deal of benefit if i even do a 10-minute meditation and, out of that 10 minutes, if 4 of the minutes my mind can be very still and very silent", "there\u2019s great guided meditations now", "there\u2019s apps, there\u2019s all kinds of things you can do for meditation", "but, for me, it\u2019s just about \u2013 i won\u2019t say silencing the mind because that\u2019s impossible because those thoughts are always going to pop up \u2013 but, when those thoughts pop up, you just notice them, you identify them, you let them float in front of your eyes almost like one of those old-fashioned wall street ticker machines", "and you find\u2013 i find \u2013 a tremendous amount of peace, serenity, and bliss in just being in consciousness", "and consciousness is not thought, consciousness is just being \u2013 \u201ci am this being", "i am not separate from the giant being of earth, and the cosmos, and the universe.\u201d and just being in that stillness is incredibly rewarding", "i get really a ton of clarity and i get a ton of energy from it", "and these have been proven in scientific studies, by the way, in all kinds of things from healing trauma, to giving you more energy, to giving you more focus in your work", "meditation is a pretty incredible tool", "and lowering cortisol", "i\u2019ve been spending time interacting with some researchers at johns hopkins \u2013 a gentleman named roland griffiths and also a gent named adam gazalley who runs a neuroimaging lab at ucsf", "and what\u2019s been very interesting \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to go down the rabbit hole with this \u2013 but it appears that, if you look at experienced meditators and brain activity \u2013 and i\u2019m blanking on the particular area, i think it might be somewhere in the parietal lobe but i could be off", "in any case, there\u2019s a portion of the brain that is thought to contribute to the separation of self and other", "so it\u2019s inhibited both in the use of, say, psilocybin, which was found in magic mushrooms, but also you experience a similar type of pattern in experienced meditators which is kind of cool", "[crosstalk] well, i know that they \u2013 oh, sorry, go ahead go ahead", "yeah, i heard a fascinating thing on the radio once where they did a study and they found the happiest man in the world", "so they did a brain scan and they found the happiest person they could possibly find", "and this guys was \u2013 i think he was an american, he was living in wisconsin \u2013 but he was a student of tibetan buddhism", "and, at the time when they did the brain scan \u2013 which charted out as the very happiest \u2013 he was in the process of meditating and it was a meditation of universal compassion so it\u2019s a meditation where you\u2019re feeling at one with everyone and great compassion for everyone on the planet earth and all beings on planet earth \u2013 human, animal, plant \u2013 what they\u2019re going through", "and, in so doing, that achieved the greatest happiness", "that goes along with what you\u2019re saying", "no, definitely", "and, even if you are self-interested, there\u2019s a biological benefit to empathy, and compassion, and meditation", "so i just want to reiterate something you said because i think it\u2019s so important is that i try to meditate 20 minutes each morning and, like you mentioned, there are apps like calm and headspace that are very helpful for this \u2013 but even if i\u2019m just violently, excuse me, let me try english again, violently getting punched in the psyche by my to-do list, and worries, and anxieties, and thoughts for 15, or even 18 minutes out of 20, if i have 2 minutes where the mud settles and the mind is clear, it has an incredible impact on the entire day for me", "i feel exactly the same way", "that\u2019s exactly my experience", "even out of a 10-minute meditation, if i can just get two or three minutes in there where i have almost achieved thoughtlessness and just a serene bliss, it\u2019s like taking a powernap and it helps you through your whole day", "definitely", "and i think it was tara broch who said this to me \u2013 it might have been someone else \u2013 but they said, \u201cif you just come back to your breath, or a mantra, or whatever it is that you\u2019re focusing on if you\u2019re doing concentrated meditation, it\u2019s the coming back that is the practice", "so, if you\u2019re just distracted and you\u2019re basically just bouncing off the walls with your monkey mind for those 19 minutes, if you come back even once, you can consider it a successful session", "and i think, for type a personalities, that\u2019s really important to keep in mind", "yeah", "you mentioned something i\u2019d love to explore a little bit which is that acting can be a wonderful escape \u2013 and i\u2019m paraphrasing here \u2013 from your own head", "i was actually watching amy\u00a0yesterday \u2013 which is a documentary about amy winehouse and very sad story, tragic on many levels \u2013 but she produced some beautiful music from bad experiences and she was able to escape her own head by putting these poems which became songs on paper", "are there any particular exercises from whether it\u2019s acting school, or improv, or otherwise, that you think could benefit non-actors who just want to help create new avenues of thinking or embrace some type of therapeutic effect of getting outside their own head", "yeah, specific ones, i suppose i could go into, but i studied with a great teacher at nyu named paul walker \u2013 he died of aids \u2013 but he was an exquisite teacher and he taught theater games", "and, for me, that was a real revelation because, when i had tried acting early on, i was very stiff, and very in my head, and cerebral, and stuck, and it was very conscious like, \u201chow am i going to say this line?\u201d and \u201chow do i best look when i\u2019m turning this way?\u201d it was just a very self-conscious style of acting that was bad", "it was sucky", "so what paul got us doing in acting school at nyu was just playing and there\u2019s something incredibly freeing about playing like a kid and that your impulses as an actor and your impulses as a kid at play are really the same thing", "like i said before, it\u2019s deeply pretending", "so are there specific exercises", "i suppose i could think of some but how much fun is it to play \u201cred light, green light\u201d for 20 minutes or \u201cduck, duck, goose,\u201d and then to move from those exercises into more and more imaginative improvisations but where you allow yourself to just play like a child", "and, sometimes, children play and they\u2019re competitive, sometimes, they play and they\u2019re very serious \u2013 it\u2019s not all this general, \u201cwhee,\u201d stuff", "and i found that so freeing and it was the key for me as an actor that broke me open, and got me out of my head, and just got me in my body, and in that place of pure imagination and spontaneity that you really want as an actor", "mm-hmm", "and i think it seems to me, also, when you put yourself in that place \u2013 much like meditation, you have to be present state aware", "you can\u2019t be worrying about something that you have scheduled two weeks in the future or resenting something like some idiot who cut you off in traffic that morning", "you have to be in that moment, and be effective, and to have fun", "you just can\u2019t be distracted by those things", "yeah, like we\u2019ll do a thing where you \u2013 i just remember because i did it recently where i did sessions with the employees at soul pancake, games and improv stuff \u2013 where everyone has a number from 1 to 10", "there\u2019s two teams of ten on each side of the room", "there\u2019s a stool in the center of the room with a shoe on it and the goal is you\u2019ve got to get the shoe and then get back to your place in line", "right", "it\u2019s a pretty simple game", "but then you also do this game called, \u201csexy nostril,\u201d where you write down adjectives and you write down body parts so it could be \u201cangry,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d \u201clonely,\u201d \u201cenergetic\u201d \u2013 those are the adjectives and then body parts, \u201cearlobe,\u201d \u201ctesticle,\u201d \u201canus,\u201d \u201cshoulder blade,\u201d \u201cfingernail,\u201d whatever", "and you draw one of each and then you try and play a game manifesting those characteristics", "so, if you have \u201csexy nostril,\u201d then you have to play that same game of getting the shoe and getting back in line but you\u2019re a person where the center of their energy is in their nostril and it\u2019s a very sensual, sexual energy", "and it helps you create a character and play as that character, and it takes you out of your head and it just gets you in your body and gets you feeling and responding", "i love teaching that stuff", "it\u2019s super fun", "and, for me, tim, i\u2019m in my head a lot and it kind of sucks", "[crosstalk] yeah, me, too", "[crosstalk] so there\u2019s certain tools that i have to use to get by", "so i\u2019ve learned in my life \u2013 i don\u2019t remember every day \u2013 but there\u2019s certain things i have to do to just be out of my head and just to get to normal", "i\u2019m not talking about being really super effective", "just to get to normal, i have to do meditation", "i have to do some exercise", "if i can get into nature, great", "if i can play some tennis, better", "and acting is that same way \u2013 acting, rehearsing, playing characters \u2013 these are the things that get me out of my head and out of just analyzing every goddamn thing that comes down the pike and leaves me miserable and making really bad choices", "well, there you have it, folks \u2013 my first episode of the tim ferriss radio hour with some of the superstars, some of the experts that i\u2019ve spoken to over the past few years", "and this is an experiment, as i said at the top of the show", "i want to know what did you like", "what did you not like", "how can it be improved", "do you want more of these or should we just skip it", "that\u2019s totally fair as well", "what topics would you like me to most explore or consolidate", "what types of patterns", "in other words, i just want your feedback so please let me know what did you like, what didn\u2019t you like, what should i do more of, less of", "and you can ping me on twitter, @tferriss \u2013 t-f-e-r-r-i-s-s \u2013 or on the blog at fourhourworkweek.com/blog", "if you\u2019re a facebooker \u2013 you love the facebooks \u2013 you could go to facebook.com/timferriss with two \u201cr\u2019s\u201d and two \u201cs\u2019s\u201d but, generally speaking, twitter is going to be the best means of communication for now \u2013 @tferriss", "so please let me know your thoughts and, as always and until next time, thank you for listening"]}
