This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers of all types to tease out the habits, routines, tactics, tools, favorite books, etc. that you can use. In this episode, we are going to do a highlight reel and invite back one of our guests who was a huge surprise hit \u2013 Bren\u00e9 Brown. Dr. Bren\u00e9 Brown (on Twitter @Brenebrown, Brenebrown.com) is a research professor at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work. Bren\u00e9\u2019s 2010 TEDx Houston Talk, \u201cThe Power of Vulnerability\u201d \u2013 you probably don\u2019t associate that with me, but maybe you will by the end of this \u2013 has been viewed more than 31 million times and is one of the top 5 most-viewed TED Talks in the world. She has spent the past 13 years studying vulnerability, courage, worthiness, and shame. Bren\u00e9 is the New York Times best selling author of Daring Greatly: The Gifts of Imperfection and Rising Strong. So this episode turned into a therapy session of sorts for me because I felt like I needed a lot of help related to topics she has explored. I thought I would give you a sample of some of the highlights, the things that I apply to my own life and have revisited many times since and it includes my commentary. This is really a sample of a small profile in Tools of Titans, which is my new book. ToolsofTitans.com \u2013 you should check it out. That book does not have an audio edition. There are too many illustrations, exercises, all sorts of stuff throughout the book for that to be feasible right now. But I want to tease it. I was to give you a little Scooby snack. So hopefully you get the text that is the hardcover or Kindle edition for yourself and all of your loved ones that you care about. Don\u2019t leave them stranded, folks. That would be so callous and selfish of you. So please enjoy this distilled collection of highlights from Dr. Bren\u00e9 Brown, and there are some other goodies that follow that, but I will leave that a surprise for you to experience. So please enjoy this Round 2 episode of highlights, action packed with Dr. Bren\u00e9 Brown. Afraid and brave can co-exist. Bren\u00e9 Brown: You know, this idea that we\u2019re either courageous or we\u2019re chicken shit is just not true because most of us are afraid and brave at the exact same moment all day long. Tim Ferriss: My commentary: This reminded me of Cus D\u2019Amato, who was Mike Tyson\u2019s legendary first coach and was just a treasure trove of one-liners. But he used to tell his athletes the following before big fights: \u201cThe hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear, projects it onto his opponent, while the coward runs.\u201d It\u2019s the same thing \u2013 fear, but it\u2019s what you do with it that matters. And he, in fact, coached Tyson to the [inaudible]. And Tyson, I believe, used to, in fact, get extremely sick before his fights, much like Dean Martin before big performances or any performances, up until the very end. Dean Martin, in fact, would vomit backstage. But Tyson would start off very afraid, in effect, and work himself up to the point that gradually by the time he proceeded to the ring, he believed he was himself, a God. I\u2019m not recommending that necessarily, but the point being the hero and the coward feel the same thing. It\u2019s what they do with that fear that makes them different. Give discomfort its due. Do you have any ask or request for all the people listening? Bren\u00e9 Brown: I would just say keep being part of the conversation about these tougher topics, about vulnerability, about shame, about being brave. Just lean into some discomfort because I think these seemingly impossible problems that we have around race and homophobia and environment and just the lack of love sometimes are not going to be solved in a comfortable way. You have to choose comfort or courage. You just can\u2019t have both. So I guess my ask would be more of a big metaphysical ask that you give vulnerability a shot and give discomfort its due because I think there is a really strong relationship between your willingness \u2013 he or she who is willing to be the most uncomfortable is not only the bravest, but rises the fastest. Tim Ferriss: My commentary: For what it is worth, because thousands of people have highlighted this, one of the most common Kindle highlights from The Four-Hour Workweek is actually very complementary to this. It is, \u201cA person\u2019s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.\u201d In fact, when I am perhaps vacillating between to-do items or wondering what the most important thing is on my to-do list, it is generally that which makes me the most uncomfortable. When I had the opportunity, did I choose courage over comfort? Bren\u00e9 actually flew under the radar for a very long time, until she came across Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s, Teddy\u2019s, famous arena quote and I\u2019m just going to give you a piece of it here, and that is, \u201cThe credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error in shortcoming.\u201d There\u2019s more to it, of course. She decided at that point to teach as a public figure, to \u00a0step out of \u2013 not the shadows necessarily, but the corners \u2013 into the light, despite hurtful online comments and attacks. Bren\u00e9 Brown: In that moment, what I realized is, you know what? I do want to live a brave life. I do want to live in the arena. If you\u2019re going to live in the arena, the only guaranty is you will get your ass kicked. The second thing is that daring greatly is being vulnerable, so when you ask yourself, did I dare greatly today? The big question I ask is, did I, when I had the opportunity, did I choose courage over comfort? Tim Ferriss: My commentary: This is a great question also for daily review. For instance, as part of the p.m. review using something like the 5-Minute Journal or other evening journal. How that translates to more than 30 million video views. Bren\u00e9 Brown: I went to the TED event and I experimented. I really kind of put myself out there. I talked about my own breakdown, spiritual awakening. I talked about having to go to therapy and how much I really hated that and kind of thought it was bullshit, but I felt like I had to do it. I really put myself out there. I remember driving home and thinking, \u201cI will never do that again.\u201d Tim Ferriss: She then watched the popularity of her video absolutely explode. Now totaling more than 31 million views on Ted.com and YouTube. Bren\u00e9 Brown: And so if I look back, so my learning, my take-away from that experience was this: If I\u2019m not a little bit nauseous when I\u2019m done, I probably did not show up like I should have shown up. Tim Ferriss: One of her rules for public speaking \u2013 house lights. Bren\u00e9 Brown: So when I rehearse in the traditional way we think about rehearsing, it\u2019s about what I\u2019m going to say and when I\u2019m going to say it and how I\u2019m going to say it. And so if I do that, what ends up happening \u2013 and I\u2019ve tried it a couple times \u2013 I get so pre-frontal cortex, I get so wrapped up and oh, wasn\u2019t I supposed to pause here and wasn\u2019t I supposed to do this there? That I am not connecting. And so for me, it is use images as the arc, understand what every image means to me, and what I want to wrap around that image, and then require that the house lights are on so I can see people\u2019s faces. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good rule. That\u2019s a really good rule. Bren\u00e9 Brown: Yeah, so that thing where they\u2019re \u2013 and I rarely allow any of my presentations to be videotaped. Very rarely. Because (1) if they\u2019re taping you, you have to be super hot under the lights and the audience has to be dark, and then it\u2019s performance, not connection for me. Tim Ferriss: Shame versus guilt. Bren\u00e9 Brown: And shame and guilt are very different. Shame is \u201cI am a bad person.\u201d Guilt is \u201cI did something bad.\u201d So you go out on Thursday night, you get wasted. You\u2019re so hungover on Friday you sleep through your alarm clock, you miss a really important meeting, you get to work late on Friday and your self-talk is \u201cJesus, I\u2019m a loser. I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019m such a loser.\u201d That\u2019s shame. If you get to work on Friday, same scenario, and your self-talk is \u201cDude, I cannot believe I did that. That was such a lame thing to do. That was such a stupid thing to do.\u201d The difference is, shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior. Tim Ferriss: To be trusted, be vulnerable. Bren\u00e9 Brown: It\u2019s interesting that you talk about daily practices because I think vulnerability is a daily practice and for a lot of us, at least for me, when it was new, it was about trying on new ways of being and testing it out. One of the things that emerged from the data is this idea of trust and the relationship between trust and vulnerability. People always ask me, you gain trust first and then you\u2019re vulnerable with people. But the truth is, you can\u2019t really earn trust over time with people without being somewhat vulnerable. Tim Ferriss: My commentary: You should also check out \u2013 and you can find all these episodes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, but Gabby Reece\u2019s advice to go first, as well as Neil Strauss\u2019 pre-interview approach. [Inaudible] in the text version and hopefully soon the audio version of Tools of Titans, so check that out. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? Bren\u00e9 Brown: You know what\u2019s so weird? I don\u2019t picture anybody. I picture the word redefine. That has been such a dangerous word in my research, the word \u201csuccessful\u201d or \u201csuccess.\u201d Tim Ferriss: I agree. Bren\u00e9 Brown: That I don\u2019t even use it anymore because what does that mean? Okay, so I am the CEO of this company, I make a shit ton of money, this is my title, this is the influence and power I have, I\u2019m on my fourth marriage and no relationship with my adult children. Tim Ferriss: Right. Bren\u00e9 Brown: So I think when I hear the word \u201csuccessful,\u201d my answer is be clear that your ladder is leaning against the right building. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any advice or what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self? Bren\u00e9 Brown: It\u2019s okay to be afraid. You don\u2019t have to be so scary when you\u2019re scared. Tim Ferriss: Meaning what? Put on airs of confidence and over-confidence? Bren\u00e9 Brown: Yes. Like the 30s are so exhausting. It\u2019s like the age of perfecting, proving, pretending, and there\u2019s some liberation, for me, that came in my 40s. There was a breakdown, of course, but followed by some liberation that came in my 40s. So I would just say stop hustling. Tim Ferriss: And now we have a bonus for those of you who may be interested. This is the first chapter of Tools of Titans. It contains some good quotes, some of my favorites. It contains some background on me that you may not be familiar with, as well as some concepts and so on that you can apply without even reading the book, if you\u2019re one of those bad people who\u2019s not going to even consider it. So let\u2019s jump right into it and start with some quotes. \u201cOut on the edge you see all kinds of things you can\u2019t see from the center. Big, undreamed of things. The people on the edge see them first.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut. \u201cRoutine in an intelligent man is a sign of ambition.\u201d W.H. Auden. I am a compulsive note taker. To wit, I have recorded nearly never workout since age 18 or so, roughly eight feet of shelf space in my home is occupied by spine upon spine of notebook upon notebook. That, mind you, is just one subject. It extends to dozens. Some people would call that OCD. A lot of my friends do. Many would consider it a manic, wild goose chase, but I view it simply. It is the collection of my life\u2019s recipes. My goal is to learn things once so that I can use them forever. For example, let\u2019s say I stumble upon a picture of myself from June 5th, 2007 and I think, \u201cI really wish I looked like that again.\u201d Well, no problem. I crack open a dusty volume for 2007, review the eight weeks of training and food logs preceding June 5, repeat them and voila, I end up looking nearly the same as my younger self, minus the hair probably. It\u2019s not always that easy, but it often is. Tools of Titans, like my other books, is a compendium of recipes for high performance that I gathered for my own use. This is very important. It was to scratch my own itch. There\u2019s one big difference though. I never planned on publishing this one. As I write this, I\u2019m sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Paris overlooking the Luxembourg Garden, just off of Rue St. Jacques. Rue St. Jacques is likely the oldest road in Paris and it has a very rich literary history. Victor Hugo lived a few blocks from where I\u2019m sitting. Gertrude Stein drank coffee. F. Scott Fitzgerald socialized within a stone\u2019s throw. Hemingway himself wandered up and down the sidewalks, his books percolating in his mind. Wine, no doubt, percolating in his blood. I came to France to take a break from everything. Everything. By that, I mean no social media, no email, no social commitments, no set plans, except for one project. The month had been set aside to review all of the lessons I\u2019d learned from nearly 200 world-class performers I\u2019d interviewed on The Tim Ferriss Show, my podcast, which is now more than 100 million downloads. The guests included chess prodigies, movie stars, four-star generals, pro athletes and hedge fund managers, just to name a few. It\u2019s a broad spectrum and it was a motley crew. More than a handful of them have since become collaborators in business and creative projects spanning from investments to indie film. As a result, I\u2019d absorbed a lot of their wisdom outside of our recordings, whether they were workouts, wine-infused jam sessions, text message exchanges, dinners, or late-night phone calls. In every case, I\u2019d gotten to know them well beyond the superficial headlines in the media. My life had already improved in every area as a result of the lessons I could remember, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of the jams were still lodged in thousands upon thousands of pages of transcripts. I literally mean 10,000+ pages of transcripts and hand-scribbled notes, because of all that I\u2019d learned outside of the recordings. More than anything, I longed for the chance to distill everything into a playbook. So I\u2019d set aside an entire month for review and if I\u2019m being honest, lots of chocolate croissants to put together the ultimate Cliff Notes for myself. It would be the notebook to end all notebooks, something that could help me in minutes and be read for a lifetime. That was the lofty goal at least and I wasn\u2019t sure what the result would be exactly. But within weeks of starting, the experience exceeded all expectations. No matter the situation I found myself in, something in this book, meaning Tools of Titans, was able to help. Now, when I\u2019m feeling stuck, trapped, desperate, angry, conflicted, or simply unclear, the first thing I do is flip through these pages with a strong cup of coffee in hand. So far, the needed medicine has popped out within about 20 minutes of revisiting these friends, who will now become your friends. You need a reassuring pat on the back? There\u2019s someone for that. An unapologetic slap in the face? Plenty of people for that too. Someone to explain why your fears are unfounded or why your excuses are bullshit? Done. Plenty of people to help. There are a lot of powerful quotes, but this book is much more than a compilation of quotes. It is a toolkit for changing your life because there are many books full of interviews. This is different because I don\u2019t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can\u2019t test something or replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I\u2019m just not interested. Everything in these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I\u2019ve used dozens of these tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration. They work when you need them most. Some applications are obvious at first glance, while others are subtle and will provoke something like a \u201cHoly shit, now I get it\u201d realization weeks later, while you\u2019re daydreaming in the shower or about to fall asleep. Many of the one-liners teach volumes. Some summarize excellence in an entire field in one sentence. As Josh Waitzkin, chess prodigy and the inspiration behind Searching for Bobby Fisher might put it, these bite-sized learnings are a way to \u201clearn the macro from the micro.\u201d The process of piecing them together was revelatory for me. If I thought I saw The Matrix before, I was mistaken or I was only seeing 10 percent of it. Still, even that 10 percent, these islands of notes on individual mentors had already changed my life and helped me 10X my results. But after revisiting more of them, 100 minds as part of the same fabric, things got very interesting very quickly. For the movie nerds among you, it was like the end of The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects. \u201cThe red doorknob!\u201d \u201cThe fucking Kobayashi coffee cup! How did I knot notice that it was right in front of me the whole time?\u201d Well, that\u2019s how I felt. Some piecing together patterns that sometimes occurred a year and a half, two years apart. To help you see the same, I\u2019ve done my best to weave patterns together throughout the book, noting where guests have complementary habits, beliefs and recommendations. The completed jigsaw puzzle is much greater than the sum of its parts. So what makes these people different? Well, we\u2019ll start with a quote. \u201cJudge a man by his questions rather than his answers.\u201d That is Pierre-Marc-Gaston L\u00e9vis. I don\u2019t know how to pronounce the French, despite my time in Paris. I\u2019ve been trying. These world-class performers do not have superpowers. Very important. The rules they\u2019ve crafted for themselves allow the bending of reality to such an extent that it may seem that way, but they\u2019ve learned how to do this and so can you. These rules are often simply uncommon habits and bigger questions. In a surprising number of cases, the power is in the absurd. The more absurd, the more impossible seeming the question, the more profound the answers. Take, for instance, a question that serial billionaire Peter Thiel likes to ask himself and others. \u201cIf you have a ten-year plan of how to get somewhere, you should ask why can\u2019t you do this in six months?\u201d Okay, so back to me. For purposes of illustration, I might reword that \u2013 and I often do to myself \u2013 what might you do to accomplish your ten-year goals in the next six months if you had a gun against your head? Now, let\u2019s pause for a second. Do I expect you to take ten seconds to ponder this and then magically accomplish ten years\u2019 worth of dreams in the next few months? No, I don\u2019t expect that. But I do expect that the question will productively break your mind. Like a butterfly shattering a chrysalis to emerge with new capabilities. In other words, the normal systems that you have in place, the social rules that you forced upon yourself, the standard frameworks, all of your assumptions that you\u2019ve carried with you, they don\u2019t work when answering a question like this. You\u2019re forced to shed artificial constraints and you realize that you\u2019ve had the ability to renegotiate reality all along. In many cases, and you\u2019ll come up with a list of different options, maybe 90 percent of them are completely worthless, but it is the 10 percent that could completely change your life and business. All of this just takes practice. My suggestion is that you spend real time with the questions you find the most ridiculous in this book. Thirty minutes of stream of consciousness journaling, which I detail more on page 224, could change your life completely. On top of that, while the world is a gold mine, you need to go digging in other people\u2019s heads to unearth riches. Questions are your pickaxes and competitive advantage. This book will give you an arsenal of questions to choose from. Performance-enhancing details, that\u2019s the subheading. When organizing all of this material for myself, I didn\u2019t want an onerous 37-step program or something like that. I wanted low-hanging fruit with immediate returns. Think of the bite-sized rules within these pages as PEDs. That usually stands for \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs,\u201d but here it stands for performance-enhancing details. They can be added to any training regimen, so just think different careers, personal preferences, unique responsibilities, etc. to pour gasoline on the fire of progress. So, whether you have a mortgage and a bunch of kids or no mortgage and no kids, all of these or many of them can be applied to your unique situation. Fortunately, 10X results don\u2019t always require 10X effort. Big changes can come in very small packages to dramatically change things for you. You don\u2019t necessarily need to run a 100-mile race, get a Ph.D. or completely reinvent yourself. It\u2019s the small things, the very small things done consistently that are the big things. For instance, practicing red teaming once per quarter. As, say, a General Stanley McChrystal or Mark Andreesen might more often. You could listen to Tara Brach\u2019s guided meditations, like Maria Popova does and credits it with changing her life. Specifically, the 2010 smile meditation by Tara Brach, which you can find online for free. Strategic fasting or exogenous ketones. These are things that do not take a lot of effort whatsoever and you can test them very quickly. You can test them tomorrow. You can test them this week and then you throw a lot against the wall and you figure out quickly what works for you. Tool here, as in Tools of Titans, is defined very broadly in this book. It includes routines, books, common self-talk, supplements, favorite questions and a lot more. What do these people have in common? Well, in this book, you\u2019re naturally look for common habits and recommends and you should do that. Here are a few patterns, some of them odder than others. More than 80 percent of the interviewees have some form of daily mindfulness or meditation practice, so we talk about a lot of different options. A surprising number of males, not females, over 45 never eat breakfast or eat just one meal per day. That includes Laird Hamilton, the undisputed king of big wave surfing, General Stanley McChrystal, and so on. There are probably a dozen or more examples of that. Many use the chilly pad device for cooling at bedtime to find their optimal sleeping temperature. Rave reviews of books like Sapiens, Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanac, Influence, and Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, among others. There are some very odd documentaries that pop up repeatedly as a favorite, including many I\u2019d never heard of. Here\u2019s a new one: the habit of listening to a single song on repeat for focus, almost like an external mantra. Nearly everyone has done some form of spec work. They\u2019ve completed projects on their own time and dime and then submitted them to prospective buyers. The belief, of course, the loss of use and foundational beliefs are tools that failure is not durable, or variants thereof. Robert Rodriquez. Robert Rodriquez is a good example of that. Almost every guest has been able to take obvious weaknesses, weaknesses they\u2019ve been told are weaknesses, and turned them into hue competitive advantages. Arnold Schwarzenegger would be one example. Dan Carlin, who is the creative of my favorite podcast, Hardcore History, would even say copyright your faults. He goes into the entire story of how he did that in radio leading up to podcasting. Now, of course, I will try to help you connect all of these dots, spot these types of patterns. But that\u2019s less than half of the value of everything that we\u2019ll discuss. Some of the most encouraging workarounds are found in the outliers. It\u2019s very important to look for the outliers and not throw out the baby with the bathwater, just because they seem odd. I want you to look for the black sheep who fit your unique idiosyncrasies. Keep an eye out for the nontraditional paths, like Shay Carl\u2019s journal from manual laborer to YouTube star, to co-founder of a start-up sold for nearly a billion dollars. The variation is the consistency. As a software engineer might say, \u201cThat\u2019s not a bug. That\u2019s a feature.\u201d So borrow liberally, combine uniquely and create your own bespoke blueprint. That is how this works. All right. Now the following that I\u2019m going to read is specific to the book, but it\u2019s not specific to the book. It actually applies to a lot more. So first of all, this book is a buffet and here\u2019s how to get the most of it. It\u2019s a 704-page book, but I don\u2019t expect anyone to read the entire thing. In fact, if you were to only read 100 pages and pick your favorites and dip in and dip out, that\u2019s how it\u2019s designed \u2013 like a choose-your-own-adventure book \u2013 I would be thrilled. So Rule No. 1: skip liberally. I want you to skip anything that doesn\u2019t grab you. It should be fun to read and you shouldn\u2019t suffer through anything. If you hate shrimp, don\u2019t eat the goddamned shrimp in the buffet. Skip it. My goal is for each reader to like 50 percent of the book, love 25 percent of the book, and never forget 10 percent. Here\u2019s why. For the millions who\u2019ve heard the podcasts and the dozens who\u2019ve proofread this book, that split was completely different for every person. It blew me away. I\u2019ve had multiple guests in this book, people who are the best at what they do, proofread the exact same profile for me, answering the question of which 10 percent would you absolutely keep and which 10 percent would you absolutely cut? Oftentimes, the 10 percent must keep of one Titan was exactly the must cut of someone else. So this not one-size-fits-all. I expect you to discard plenty, so you should read what you enjoy. Rule No. 2, and this applies to a lot more than this book: skip, but do so intelligently. So take a brief mental note of anything you skip. Perhaps put a little dot in the corner of the page or highlight the headline. Could it be that skipping and glossing over precisely these topics or questions has created blind spots, bottlenecks and unresolved issues in your life? That was certainly true for me. When I looked at what I was habitually skipping, it reminded me of a question from Tara Brach, which relayed the question of a mystic, who said \u201cThere\u2019s really only one question worth asking. What is it that you are unwilling to feel?\u201d If you decide to flip past something, note it, return to it later at some point and ask, \u201cWhy did I skip this?\u201d For instance, did it offend you? Did it seem beneath you? Seem too difficult? Did you arrive at that by thinking it through yourself or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents, family, friends, and others? Very often, our so-called believes are not our own at all. This type of practice is how you create yourself instead of seeking to discover yourself. There is value in the latter, this discovery, but it\u2019s mostly past-tense. It\u2019s a rearview mirror. Looking out the windshield is how you get where you want to go. Now, just remember two principles. This applies to much more than this book. I was recently standing in Place Louis Argonne. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m saying that correctly, but I\u2019ll give it a shot. It\u2019s a shaded outdoor nook on the River Seine, having a picnic with writing students from the Paris-American Academy. One woman pulled me aside, glass of wine in hand, and asked what I hoped to convey in this book at its core. Now, seconds later, we were pulled back into the fray as the attendees were taking turns talking about the circuitous paths that brought them there that day. Nearly everyone had a story of wanting to come to Paris for years. In some cases, 30 or 40 years, but assuming it was impossible. I listened to their stories and I was struck by a few things. I pulled out a scrap of paper and I jotted down my answer to her question. I remember that was, \u201cWhat did I hope to convey in this book at the core?\u201d I decided that I wanted to convey the following: two principles. No. 1, success, however you define that, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs and habits. Someone else has done your version of success before, and often many have done something similar. But, you might ask, what about a first? Like colonizing Mars? Well, that is not an out. There are still recipes. Look at empire building of other types. Look at the biggest decisions in the life of Robert Moses, for instance. If you read The Power Broker, another fantastic book. Or simply find someone who stepped up to do great things that were deemed impossible at the time, like Walt Disney. Many of the people in the book actually have done a lot of reading on Walt Disney, like Marc Andreesen. Even if they\u2019re at the cutting edge of technology today, which Walt Disney was in his time? There is shared DNA that you can borrow. Principle No. 2: The superheroes that you have in your mind, those might be idols, icons, titans, billionaires, whoever, are nearly all walking flaws who\u2019ve maximized one or two strengths. Humans are imperfect creatures and I really want to remedy the problem of people romanticizing those folks you might see on magazine covers and putting them on a pedestal. You don\u2019t succeed because you have no weaknesses. You succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them. To make this excruciatingly crystal clear, I\u2019ve deliberately included two sections in this book on pages 197 and 616, that will make you think to yourself, wow, Tim Ferriss is a mess. How the hell does he ever get anything done? Everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about, so I wanted to tell you about some of mine and what my down days look like, my bad days, and some of my darkest periods and how I get out of them. The heroes in this book are no different. Everyone struggles, so take solace in that. Now, the next section is on format. I\u2019m not going to talk a lot about it because it\u2019s really more relevant when you\u2019re going through the text. But there\u2019s a lot of humor. I play on a lot of patterns and there\u2019s a lot of original material. The book is comprised of three sections: healthy, wealthy and wise. It\u2019s a nod to Ben Franklin and on top of that, it\u2019s actually a very clean way to organize the advice from all these people. Of course, there\u2019s tremendous overlap across the sections, as all of these are interdependent. In fact, you could think of the three as a tripod upon which life is balanced. One needs all three: healthy, wealthy, and wise \u2013 health, wealth, and wisdom, to have any sustained success or happiness. Wealthy in the context of this book also means a lot more than money. It extends to abundance in time, relationships and more. My original intention with The Four-Hour Workweek, The Four-Hour Body, The Four-Hour Chef, was to create a trilogy themed, like I mentioned, after Ben Franklin\u2019s famous quote: \u201cEarly to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,\u201d even though I don\u2019t really wake up that early. People constantly ask me, what would you put in The Four-Hour Workweek if you were to write it again? How would you update it? They ask me the same thing for The Four-Hour Body and The Four-Hour Chef. Tools of Titans is, in effect, my answers for all three. So you could think of Tools of Titans as the follow-up, the sequel to all three books at once. Okay, we\u2019ll wrap it up shortly here. So my send-off to you: the three tools that allow all the rest. I\u2019m going to do a little trial run of acting as audiobook narrator in this one with trying to voice different characters. We\u2019ll see how that goes. All right. Here we go. So Siddhartha, by Herman Hess, is recommended by many guests in this book. There\u2019s one takeaway that Naval Ravikant, who is one of the most successful entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley, quietly dominating many aspects of that entire game and really sort of a philosopher king in his own domain in a lot of respects. He would never say that, but I will. He is reinforced with me several times \u2013 by the way, side note: when my Jamie Foxx episode won podcast of the year in 2015, second place was Naval Ravikant, a name that almost nobody knew. Just based on the caliber and quality of the content that he talked about and discussed and shared in that episode, so he\u2019s an incredible guy. But he\u2019s reinforced with me, personally, several times on our long walks, a story and the protagonist, Siddhartha, a monk who looks like a beggar, is that he\u2019s come to the city and he falls in love with a famous courtesan named Kamala. He attempts to court her and she asks, \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d A well-known merchant similarly asks, \u201cWhat can you give that you have learned?\u201d His answer is the same in both cases, so I\u2019ve included the latter story here. Siddhartha usually acquires all that he wants, okay? That\u2019s critical. He starts off with very humble beginnings. Now, here we go, let\u2019s try this out. All right. I\u2019m going to tell you who\u2019s talking first. Merchant: If you are without possessions, how can you give? Siddhartha: Everyone gives what he has. The soldier gives strength, the merchant gives goods, the teacher instruction, the farmer rice, the fisherman fish. Merchant: Well, very well. And what can you give? What have you learned that you can give? Siddhartha: I can think, I can wait, I can fast. Merchant: Is that all? Siddhartha: I think that is all. Merchant: And what use are they? For instance, fasting? What good is that? (I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m making him from New Jersey, but that\u2019s okay.) Siddhartha: It is of great value, sir. If a man has nothing to eat, fasting is the most intelligent thing he can do. For instance, if Siddhartha had not learned to fast, he would have had to seek some kind of work today, either from you or elsewhere, for hunger would have driven him. But as it is, Siddhartha can wait calmly. He is not impatient. He is not in need. He can ward off hunger for a long time and laugh at it. Okay, that\u2019s the end of that exchange. And back to Tim here. I think of Siddhartha\u2019s answers often and in the following terms. I can think. What does that mean? Because you\u2019ll recall, he was asked what can he give? What can he teach? What can he give? I can think, I can wait, I can fast. All right. I can think. This means having good rules for decision making and having good questions you can ask yourself and others. I can wait. To means to me being able to play the long-game. Plan long-term and not misallocate your resources. I can fast. This means, to me, being able to withstand difficulties and disaster. It means training yourself to be uncommonly resilient and to have a high pain tolerance. This book will help you to develop all three of these things in spades. I created Tools of Titans because it\u2019s the book that I\u2019ve wanted my entire life. I hope you enjoy reading it as much I enjoyed writing it.

learned from nearly 200 world-class performers i\u2019d interviewed on the tim ferriss show, my podcast, which is now more than 100 million downloads", "the guests included chess prodigies, movie stars, four-star generals, pro athletes and hedge fund managers, just to name a few", "it\u2019s a broad spectrum and it was a motley crew", "more than a handful of them have since become collaborators in business and creative projects spanning from investments to indie film", "as a result, i\u2019d absorbed a lot of their wisdom outside of our recordings, whether they were workouts, wine-infused jam sessions, text message exchanges, dinners, or late-night phone calls", "in every case, i\u2019d gotten to know them well beyond the superficial headlines in the media", "my life had already improved in every area as a result of the lessons i could remember, but that was just the tip of the iceberg", "the vast majority of the jams were still lodged in thousands upon thousands of pages of transcripts", "i literally mean 10,000+ pages of transcripts and hand-scribbled notes, because of all that i\u2019d learned outside of the recordings", "more than anything, i longed for the chance to distill everything into a playbook", "so i\u2019d set aside an entire month for review and if i\u2019m being honest, lots of chocolate croissants to put together the ultimate cliff notes for myself", "it would be the notebook to end all notebooks, something that could help me in minutes and be read for a lifetime", "that was the lofty goal at least and i wasn\u2019t sure what the result would be exactly", "but within weeks of starting, the experience exceeded all expectations", "no matter the situation i found myself in, something in this book, meaning tools of titans, was able to help", "now, when i\u2019m feeling stuck, trapped, desperate, angry, conflicted, or simply unclear, the first thing i do is flip through these pages with a strong cup of coffee in hand", "so far, the needed medicine has popped out within about 20 minutes of revisiting these friends, who will now become your friends", "you need a reassuring pat on the back", "there\u2019s someone for that", "an unapologetic slap in the face", "plenty of people for that too", "someone to explain why your fears are unfounded or why your excuses are bullshit", "done", "plenty of people to help", "there are a lot of powerful quotes, but this book is much more than a compilation of quotes", "it is a toolkit for changing your life because there are many books full of interviews", "this is different because i don\u2019t view myself as an interviewer", "i view myself as an experimenter", "if i can\u2019t test something or replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, i\u2019m just not interested", "everything in these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion", "i\u2019ve used dozens of these tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments or large business dealings", "the lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration", "they work when you need them most", "some applications are obvious at first glance, while others are subtle and will provoke something like a \u201choly shit, now i get it\u201d realization weeks later, while you\u2019re daydreaming in the shower or about to fall asleep", "many of the one-liners teach volumes", "some summarize excellence in an entire field in one sentence", "as josh waitzkin, chess prodigy and the inspiration behind searching for bobby fisher might put it, these bite-sized learnings are a way to \u201clearn the macro from the micro.\u201d the process of piecing them together was revelatory for me", "if i thought i saw the matrix before, i was mistaken or i was only seeing 10 percent of it", "still, even that 10 percent, these islands of notes on individual mentors had already changed my life and helped me 10x my results", "but after revisiting more of them, 100 minds as part of the same fabric, things got very interesting very quickly", "for the movie nerds among you, it was like the end of the sixth sense or the usual suspects", "\u201cthe red doorknob!\u201d \u201cthe fucking kobayashi coffee cup", "how did i knot notice that it was right in front of me the whole time?\u201d well, that\u2019s how i felt", "some piecing together patterns that sometimes occurred a year and a half, two years apart", "to help you see the same, i\u2019ve done my best to weave patterns together throughout the book, noting where guests have complementary habits, beliefs and recommendations", "the completed jigsaw puzzle is much greater than the sum of its parts", "so what makes these people different", "well, we\u2019ll start with a quote", "\u201cjudge a man by his questions rather than his answers.\u201d that is pierre-marc-gaston l\u00e9vis", "i don\u2019t know how to pronounce the french, despite my time in paris", "i\u2019ve been trying", "these world-class performers do not have superpowers", "very important", "the rules they\u2019ve crafted for themselves allow the bending of reality to such an extent that it may seem that way, but they\u2019ve learned how to do this and so can you", "these rules are often simply uncommon habits and bigger questions", "in a surprising number of cases, the power is in the absurd", "the more absurd, the more impossible seeming the question, the more profound the answers", "take, for instance, a question that serial billionaire peter thiel likes to ask himself and others", "\u201cif you have a ten-year plan of how to get somewhere, you should ask why can\u2019t you do this in six months?\u201d okay, so back to me", "for purposes of illustration, i might reword that \u2013 and i often do to myself \u2013 what might you do to accomplish your ten-year goals in the next six months if you had a gun against your head", "now, let\u2019s pause for a second", "do i expect you to take ten seconds to ponder this and then magically accomplish ten years\u2019 worth of dreams in the next few months", "no, i don\u2019t expect that", "but i do expect that the question will productively break your mind", "like a butterfly shattering a chrysalis to emerge with new capabilities", "in other words, the normal systems that you have in place, the social rules that you forced upon yourself, the standard frameworks, all of your assumptions that you\u2019ve carried with you, they don\u2019t work when answering a question like this", "you\u2019re forced to shed artificial constraints and you realize that you\u2019ve had the ability to renegotiate reality all along", "in many cases, and you\u2019ll come up with a list of different options, maybe 90 percent of them are completely worthless, but it is the 10 percent that could completely change your life and business", "all of this just takes practice", "my suggestion is that you spend real time with the questions you find the most ridiculous in this book", "thirty minutes of stream of consciousness journaling, which i detail more on page 224, could change your life completely", "on top of that, while the world is a gold mine, you need to go digging in other people\u2019s heads to unearth riches", "questions are your pickaxes and competitive advantage", "this book will give you an arsenal of questions to choose from", "performance-enhancing details, that\u2019s the subheading", "when organizing all of this material for myself, i didn\u2019t want an onerous 37-step program or something like that", "i wanted low-hanging fruit with immediate returns", "think of the bite-sized rules within these pages as peds", "that usually stands for \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs,\u201d but here it stands for performance-enhancing details", "they can be added to any training regimen, so just think different careers, personal preferences, unique responsibilities, etc", "to pour gasoline on the fire of progress", "so, whether you have a mortgage and a bunch of kids or no mortgage and no kids, all of these or many of them can be applied to your unique situation", "fortunately, 10x results don\u2019t always require 10x effort", "big changes can come in very small packages to dramatically change things for you", "you don\u2019t necessarily need to run a 100-mile race, get a ph.d", "or completely reinvent yourself", "it\u2019s the small things, the very small things done consistently that are the big things", "for instance, practicing red teaming once per quarter", "as, say, a general stanley mcchrystal or mark andreesen might more often", "you could listen to tara brach\u2019s guided meditations, like maria popova does and credits it with changing her life", "specifically, the 2010 smile meditation by tara brach, which you can find online for free", "strategic fasting or exogenous ketones", "these are things that do not take a lot of effort whatsoever and you can test them very quickly", "you can test them tomorrow", "you can test them this week and then you throw a lot against the wall and you figure out quickly what works for you", "tool here, as in tools of titans, is defined very broadly in this book", "it includes routines, books, common self-talk, supplements, favorite questions and a lot more", "what do these people have in common", "well, in this book, you\u2019re naturally look for common habits and recommends and you should do that", "here are a few patterns, some of them odder than others", "more than 80 percent of the interviewees have some form of daily mindfulness or meditation practice, so we talk about a lot of different options", "a surprising number of males, not females, over 45 never eat breakfast or eat just one meal per day", "that includes laird hamilton, the undisputed king of big wave surfing, general stanley mcchrystal, and so on", "there are probably a dozen or more examples of that", "many use the chilly pad device for cooling at bedtime to find their optimal sleeping temperature", "rave reviews of books like sapiens, poor charlie\u2019s almanac, influence, and man\u2019s search for meaning, among others", "there are some very odd documentaries that pop up repeatedly as a favorite, including many i\u2019d never heard of", "here\u2019s a new one: the habit of listening to a single song on repeat for focus, almost like an external mantra", "nearly everyone has done some form of spec work", "they\u2019ve completed projects on their own time and dime and then submitted them to prospective buyers", "the belief, of course, the loss of use and foundational beliefs are tools that failure is not durable, or variants thereof", "robert rodriquez", "robert rodriquez is a good example of that", "almost every guest has been able to take obvious weaknesses, weaknesses they\u2019ve been told are weaknesses, and turned them into hue competitive advantages", "arnold schwarzenegger would be one example", "dan carlin, who is the creative of my favorite podcast, hardcore history, would even say copyright your faults", "he goes into the entire story of how he did that in radio leading up to podcasting", "now, of course, i will try to help you connect all of these dots, spot these types of patterns", "but that\u2019s less than half of the value of everything that we\u2019ll discuss", "some of the most encouraging workarounds are found in the outliers", "it\u2019s very important to look for the outliers and not throw out the baby with the bathwater, just because they seem odd", "i want you to look for the black sheep who fit your unique idiosyncrasies", "keep an eye out for the nontraditional paths, like shay carl\u2019s journal from manual laborer to youtube star, to co-founder of a start-up sold for nearly a billion dollars", "the variation is the consistency", "as a software engineer might say, \u201cthat\u2019s not a bug", "that\u2019s a feature.\u201d so borrow liberally, combine uniquely and create your own bespoke blueprint", "that is how this works", "all right", "now the following that i\u2019m going to read is specific to the book, but it\u2019s not specific to the book", "it actually applies to a lot more", "so first of all, this book is a buffet and here\u2019s how to get the most of it", "it\u2019s a 704-page book, but i don\u2019t expect anyone to read the entire thing", "in fact, if you were to only read 100 pages and pick your favorites and dip in and dip out, that\u2019s how it\u2019s designed \u2013 like a choose-your-own-adventure book \u2013 i would be thrilled", "so rule no", "1: skip liberally", "i want you to skip anything that doesn\u2019t grab you", "it should be fun to read and you shouldn\u2019t suffer through anything", "if you hate shrimp, don\u2019t eat the goddamned shrimp in the buffet", "skip it", "my goal is for each reader to like 50 percent of the book, love 25 percent of the book, and never forget 10 percent", "here\u2019s why", "for the millions who\u2019ve heard the podcasts and the dozens who\u2019ve proofread this book, that split was completely different for every person", "it blew me away", "i\u2019ve had multiple guests in this book, people who are the best at what they do, proofread the exact same profile for me, answering the question of which 10 percent would you absolutely keep and which 10 percent would you absolutely cut", "oftentimes, the 10 percent must keep of one titan was exactly the must cut of someone else", "so this not one-size-fits-all", "i expect you to discard plenty, so you should read what you enjoy", "rule no", "2, and this applies to a lot more than this book: skip, but do so intelligently", "so take a brief mental note of anything you skip", "perhaps put a little dot in the corner of the page or highlight the headline", "could it be that skipping and glossing over precisely these topics or questions has created blind spots, bottlenecks and unresolved issues in your life", "that was certainly true for me", "when i looked at what i was habitually skipping, it reminded me of a question from tara brach, which relayed the question of a mystic, who said \u201cthere\u2019s really only one question worth asking", "what is it that you are unwilling to feel?\u201d if you decide to flip past something, note it, return to it later at some point and ask, \u201cwhy did i skip this?\u201d for instance, did it offend you", "did it seem beneath you", "seem too difficult", "did you arrive at that by thinking it through yourself or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents, family, friends, and others", "very often, our so-called believes are not our own at all", "this type of practice is how you create yourself instead of seeking to discover yourself", "there is value in the latter, this discovery, but it\u2019s mostly past-tense", "it\u2019s a rearview mirror", "looking out the windshield is how you get where you want to go", "now, just remember two principles", "this applies to much more than this book", "i was recently standing in place louis argonne", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m saying that correctly, but i\u2019ll give it a shot", "it\u2019s a shaded outdoor nook on the river seine, having a picnic with writing students from the paris-american academy", "one woman pulled me aside, glass of wine in hand, and asked what i hoped to convey in this book at its core", "now, seconds later, we were pulled back into the fray as the attendees were taking turns talking about the circuitous paths that brought them there that day", "nearly everyone had a story of wanting to come to paris for years", "in some cases, 30 or 40 years, but assuming it was impossible", "i listened to their stories and i was struck by a few things", "i pulled out a scrap of paper and i jotted down my answer to her question", "i remember that was, \u201cwhat did i hope to convey in this book at the core?\u201d i decided that i wanted to convey the following: two principles", "no", "1, success, however you define that, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs and habits", "someone else has done your version of success before, and often many have done something similar", "but, you might ask, what about a first", "like colonizing mars", "well, that is not an out", "there are still recipes", "look at empire building of other types", "look at the biggest decisions in the life of robert moses, for instance", "if you read the power broker, another fantastic book", "or simply find someone who stepped up to do great things that were deemed impossible at the time, like walt disney", "many of the people in the book actually have done a lot of reading on walt disney, like marc andreesen", "even if they\u2019re at the cutting edge of technology today, which walt disney was in his time", "there is shared dna that you can borrow", "principle no", "2: the superheroes that you have in your mind, those might be idols, icons, titans, billionaires, whoever, are nearly all walking flaws who\u2019ve maximized one or two strengths", "humans are imperfect creatures and i really want to remedy the problem of people romanticizing those folks you might see on magazine covers and putting them on a pedestal", "you don\u2019t succeed because you have no weaknesses", "you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them", "to make this excruciatingly crystal clear, i\u2019ve deliberately included two sections in this book on pages 197 and 616, that will make you think to yourself, wow, tim ferriss is a mess", "how the hell does he ever get anything done", "everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about, so i wanted to tell you about some of mine and what my down days look like, my bad days, and some of my darkest periods and how i get out of them", "the heroes in this book are no different", "everyone struggles, so take solace in that", "now, the next section is on format", "i\u2019m not going to talk a lot about it because it\u2019s really more relevant when you\u2019re going through the text", "but there\u2019s a lot of humor", "i play on a lot of patterns and there\u2019s a lot of original material", "the book is comprised of three sections: healthy, wealthy and wise", "it\u2019s a nod to ben franklin and on top of that, it\u2019s actually a very clean way to organize the advice from all these people", "of course, there\u2019s tremendous overlap across the sections, as all of these are interdependent", "in fact, you could think of the three as a tripod upon which life is balanced", "one needs all three: healthy, wealthy, and wise \u2013 health, wealth, and wisdom, to have any sustained success or happiness", "wealthy in the context of this book also means a lot more than money", "it extends to abundance in time, relationships and more", "my original intention with the four-hour workweek, the four-hour body, the four-hour chef, was to create a trilogy themed, like i mentioned, after ben franklin\u2019s famous quote: \u201cearly to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,\u201d even though i don\u2019t really wake up that early", "people constantly ask me, what would you put in the four-hour workweek if you were to write it again", "how would you update it", "they ask me the same thing for the four-hour body and the four-hour chef", "tools of titans is, in effect, my answers for all three", "so you could think of tools of titans as the follow-up, the sequel to all three books at once", "okay, we\u2019ll wrap it up shortly here", "so my send-off to you: the three tools that allow all the rest", "i\u2019m going to do a little trial run of acting as audiobook narrator in this one with trying to voice different characters", "we\u2019ll see how that goes", "all right", "here we go", "so siddhartha, by herman hess, is recommended by many guests in this book", "there\u2019s one takeaway that naval ravikant, who is one of the most successful entrepreneurs and investors in silicon valley, quietly dominating many aspects of that entire game and really sort of a philosopher king in his own domain in a lot of respects", "he would never say that, but i will", "he is reinforced with me several times \u2013 by the way, side note: when my jamie foxx episode won podcast of the year in 2015, second place was naval ravikant, a name that almost nobody knew", "just based on the caliber and quality of the content that he talked about and discussed and shared in that episode, so he\u2019s an incredible guy", "but he\u2019s reinforced with me, personally, several times on our long walks, a story and the protagonist, siddhartha, a monk who looks like a beggar, is that he\u2019s come to the city and he falls in love with a famous courtesan named kamala", "he attempts to court her and she asks, \u201cwhat do you have?\u201d a well-known merchant similarly asks, \u201cwhat can you give that you have learned?\u201d his answer is the same in both cases, so i\u2019ve included the latter story here", "siddhartha usually acquires all that he wants, okay", "that\u2019s critical", "he starts off with very humble beginnings", "now, here we go, let\u2019s try this out", "all right", "i\u2019m going to tell you who\u2019s talking first", "merchant: if you are without possessions, how can you give", "siddhartha: everyone gives what he has", "the soldier gives strength, the merchant gives goods, the teacher instruction, the farmer rice, the fisherman fish", "merchant: well, very well", "and what can you give", "what have you learned that you can give", "siddhartha: i can think, i can wait, i can fast", "merchant: is that all", "siddhartha: i think that is all", "merchant: and what use are they", "for instance, fasting", "what good is that", "(i don\u2019t know why i\u2019m making him from new jersey, but that\u2019s okay.) siddhartha: it is of great value, sir", "if a man has nothing to eat, fasting is the most intelligent thing he can do", "for instance, if siddhartha had not learned to fast, he would have had to seek some kind of work today, either from you or elsewhere, for hunger would have driven him", "but as it is, siddhartha can wait calmly", "he is not impatient", "he is not in need", "he can ward off hunger for a long time and laugh at it", "okay, that\u2019s the end of that exchange", "and back to tim here", "i think of siddhartha\u2019s answers often and in the following terms", "i can think", "what does that mean", "because you\u2019ll recall, he was asked what can he give", "what can he teach", "what can he give", "i can think, i can wait, i can fast", "all right", "i can think", "this means having good rules for decision making and having good questions you can ask yourself and others", "i can wait", "to means to me being able to play the long-game", "plan long-term and not misallocate your resources", "i can fast", "this means, to me, being able to withstand difficulties and disaster", "it means training yourself to be uncommonly resilient and to have a high pain tolerance", "this book will help you to develop all three of these things in spades", "i created tools of titans because it\u2019s the book that i\u2019ve wanted my entire life", "i hope you enjoy reading it as much i enjoyed writing it", "i close off with, \u201cpura vida\u201d from the land of costa rica, of course, \u201cpura vida,\u201d signed, tim ferriss, paris, france", "so thank you for listening to that, folks", "i suggest, i implore, i would so much enjoy if you would check out tools of titans", "it is available everywhere", "you can find sample chapters at toolsoftitans.com, including the forward by arnold schwarzenegger", "please consider it for yourself and for those you care about", "it is extremely extensive and easy to read", "it\u2019s fun", "it\u2019s the first book that i\u2019ve enjoyed writing", "so there you have it", "toolsoftitans.com", "it\u2019s also available at barnes & noble, books-a-million, amazon, ibooks, indie bound, indigo, everywhere", "so as always, and until next time guys, thank you for listening"]}
