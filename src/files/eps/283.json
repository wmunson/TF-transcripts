This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, or perhaps you\u2019re listening to the brand new Tribe of Mentors podcast, which is, currently, as of this recording, No. 5 across all of iTunes and Apple podcasts. This is a cross post episode. So, it appears in both places. And I\u2019ll keep this intro short. This conversation you\u2019re going to hear is with Tim Urban, and we\u2019ll get into his bio in the actual conversation. It was recorded at Barnes & Noble in Union Square in New York City on the launch evening of the Tribe of Mentors book. You can learn all about that at tribeofmentors.com. We had a blast. The audience was awesome. Thank you to everyone who came out. And we\u2019ll probably be doing some more live experiments like this. So, without further ado, please enjoy my very wide ranging conversation with the ever hilarious and fascinating Tim Urban. All right. How\u2019s everybody doing tonight? All right. This is exciting. Thank you all so much for coming. It\u2019s a real honor and privilege to have you all here. And we\u2019re going to do something a little bit different tonight. Rather than do what is the norm and perhaps what I\u2019ve done many times before, which is get up and tell you all about this book that you already own, I thought we\u2019d do a bonus round with one of the guests, one of the people who was interviewed for Tribe of Mentors. So, I\u2019m going to welcome him to the stage in just a moment. But I\u2019ll read the bio first while I wrestle with the audio. And here we go. One of my favorite people in New York City. So, I\u2019m excited. And we\u2019ll be asking questions I have not asked him before. So, this is a rare, live edition of the Tim Ferriss Show, in some ways also. Here we go. Tim Urban, who is Tim Urban. Twitter, Facebook @waitbutwhy, waitbutwhy.com. Tim Urban is the author of the blog Wait But Why and has become one of the internet\u2019s most popular writers. Tim, according to Fast Company, has captured a level of reader engagement that even the new media giant would be envious of. Today Wait But Why receives more than 1.5 million unique visitors per month, among them Elon Musk, and has more than 550,000 email subscribers. Tim has gained a number of prominent readers as well like author Sam Harris and Susan Kane, Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, head curator Chris Anderson. That\u2019s one of my buddies, hi, Chris and brain picking, some Maria Popova. Tim\u2019s series of posts after interviewing Elon Musk had been called by Vox\u2019s David Roberts \u201cthe meatiest, most fascinating, most satisfying posts I\u2019ve read in ages.\u201d You can start with the first one, Elon Musk, The World\u2019s Raddist Man. Tim\u2019s Ted Talk, Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator, has received more than now, I checked it yesterday, 25 million combined views. Please welcome to the stage the incredible, the brilliant and handsome Tim Urban. Tim Urban: I feel like this is like your birthday party, and I\u2019m stepping in the middle. It\u2019s very uncomfortable. Tim Ferriss: Well, I said what other Tim can I bring into the fold for those people who are maybe a little older like I am. This is the T2, the improved version. That\u2019s a Terminator reference. All right. So, I figured we\u2019ll jump into it. And what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019ll have a conversation, which mostly involves me just asking him questions. And then, we\u2019ll jump into this fish bowl and answer some of your questions. And then, after that, we will have the opportunity, we might be here for a while, so, I will not be offended if people are like peace, I\u2019m out. I don\u2019t want to wait. But we will have a chance to say hello. And people who want to have photographs and so on, we\u2019ll be able to do that. Okay. Let\u2019s just jump right into it. Wait But Why. Before Wait But Why and you and I chatted a little bit about this, I guess, it feels like a couple of nights ago, but maybe it was yesterday, I can\u2019t remember, it\u2019s been a big week, you blogged casually for six years or so on the side. Could you tell us about that blog? What subjects did you cover? What characterized what you did part time for six years? Tim Urban: So, it was called Underneath the Turban, so, that\u2019s a little thing that I came up with. And \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The turban? Tim Urban: Yes, because my name is Tim Urban. I was 23. I wasn\u2019t \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It took me a second. Tim Urban: It was not a serious project. And it was very much a side project. It was actually, I think, I can credit the fact that it was a side project for why I was actually able to kind of be productive because I didn\u2019t have this pressure to do it. I was like what\u2019s my voice? Who am I as a writer? I wasn\u2019t a writer. I was doing something else. I was going to blog to procrastinate from the other things I was supposed to be doing, which liberated me creatively, actually. I was able to kind of do my own thing and kind of find my voice and be kind of a little bit courageous, at times. And I think for someone like me, it was like I tricked myself into actually doing stuff that I normally probably would have been a little bit more belabored in trying to get it going. Tim Ferriss: What types of subjects? Was it similar? How was it most different, and how was it most similar to Wait But Why? Tim Urban: So, it was very much more like a blog blog. I\u2019d write about my day. I\u2019d rant about going to the store, and then, they had McDonald\u2019s there. And then, I was like don\u2019t get the six piece nugget, get the four, and then, I ordered the ten. And it was the end of the night, so, they gave me eighteen. And I ate all 18. And it was like that kind of story about my day, very much off the top of my head just typing, publishing. And it was a small, little, passionate following of like 700 people and 6 comments on a thing, and that was that. And this was this side project. But it was a way for me to actually write 300 blog posts over a 6 year span. Tim Ferriss: Were there any seeds for that experience that then informed Wait But Why, and why did you create Wait But Why? And where does the name come from? Tim Urban: Yeah. So, I was able to kind of hone my voice writing 300 blog posts. I look back at the early ones, and I wince at the tones I was using. So, 300 blog posts will teach you the voice you like to write in. And so, that\u2019s one thing. And then, towards the end, I decided one night to try to draw something. And I kind of said let me \u2013 I was going to try to depict this concept of it was funny when somebody \u2013 it was like doppelganger day on Facebook, and somebody posts a doppelganger that\u2019s way better looking than they are, I always think that\u2019s kind of hilarious. And I was like I\u2019m going to draw a stick figure that\u2019s kind of messy and then a handsome stick figure with a wave of hair. And so, I did that. And it hit me that I was like that would be better in the drawing. And I realized I liked that. And so, I discovered that there, too. And so, when I started Wait But Why a couple of years \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Did other people also respond positively to that? Or did you just \u2013 Tim Urban: Very, yeah. It got great feedback, and then, I started just every post, it was like the last seven posts on the blog, all had drawings. And it was like I had discovered it at the very end. So, then, it was time to start a new project. Tim Ferriss: Why was it time to start a new project? Why not continue writing about the Chicken McNuggets? No, I\u2019m not trying to be a dick. Tim Urban: No, it\u2019s fair. And I also write about chicken nuggets sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Sorry, family programming, not sure, sorry. Continue. Tim Urban: No. It was time in my life, in general, to turn all of my attention, not a third of my attention, to one creative project. It was always I\u2019m doing something with my full time, and then, I\u2019m doing these two creative projects on the side. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to be a pain the ass. I apologize, but that\u2019s my nature. Why was it time? What realization or conversation or getting fired or whatever catalyzed the decision it\u2019s time for me to put all of my eggs in one basket creatively? Tim Urban: This thing you do makes me love your podcast. But it\u2019s stressful being the person. I\u2019m just learning this, for the first time. But so, for me, I spent the years from ages 22 to 31 hating myself a little bit because I was burning to do something creative, whether it was writing or music or something. And I always was doing them on the side. It was like that kind of just leap of faith in my own kind of ability to do something creative full time took me nine years. Nine years that I wasn\u2019t very happy. And so, I finally said I have to do something full time because I always thought, if I could just do something full time, put all of the energy from all of these things into one thing, it would go well. So, I decided \u2013 I actually owned a business with my friend, Andrew Finn. And it was the fact that the business got into a decent enough spot that we were able to start something new. And that\u2019s when I jumped on that. Tim Ferriss: What was the business? Tim Urban: It\u2019s a test prep company. Tim Ferriss: This is a great business. So, [inaudible] who is a very successful novelist also go this beginnings in that \u2013 Tim Urban: A good starter business is something \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Adam Robinson as well, so, three people in this book. That\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m just putting it together now. Tim Urban: Who knew I was on to the starter business idea? I was just procrastinating from my music career is actually all I was doing when I started it because I was tutoring on the side. And then, of course, the side things ended up taking all of my time, which is what a classic procrastinator would do. But, yeah, just simple kind of each session pays for itself. You don\u2019t need overhead. At the beginning, you don\u2019t need any full time employees. But we had built it up to the point where we had good, full time employees, good enough to run it without both of us there. And so, it was time to start something. And we had done this a couple of years ago. We started a podcast back in 2011 with the theory that podcasts were just going to get bigger, and they did. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t know how to build a good app. We built a bad app. You shouldn\u2019t build a bad app. \u00a0But now, it was a couple of years later, and it was time for something new. And I said I\u2019m going to jump on this. I need to do something creative. Let me see if I can do it as also a business that we can kind of own together. You can run our tutoring company. I\u2019m going to go and start something. And it was between writing a musical, which is a terrible business. I wouldn\u2019t want to drag him into that. Or writing maybe a content website. A platform, media platform, that can be a business. So, that\u2019s why we settled on that. I knew those were things I could do creatively well. And so, we settled on this. And the premise was what if I took instead of five hours a week to write a blog, sixty hours a week to write a blog? What would happen? And I took the things I knew that I\u2019d gotten good at on the other blog, which was just kind of writing colloquially and drawing stick figures. And I started it from there. Tim Ferriss: What is the origin of the name? Tim Urban: Sixteen hours on Go Daddy searching for dot coms. And man, there is not much. But I knew I didn\u2019t \u2013 I wanted it to be something that wouldn\u2019t pigeonhole it into \u2013 Tim Ferriss: All right. Were you just typing in random combinations of words? Or was there some itch you had related to the expression? Did you have a habit \u2013 I was imagining, oh, it\u2019s because people would say something to you, and you\u2019d want to test the assumptions, or you wouldn\u2019t accept it at face value, so, you\u2019d go wait, but why. That was in my head how I explained it. Tim Urban: I wish it was that situation. I checked 2,000 things in Go Daddy, 150 came out. My girlfriend knocked out 140 immediately. It was like absolutely not. That leaves me with 10 where I was kind of like, okay, these are all bad. Which is the least bad? If the site is good, it can seem kind of cool suddenly, maybe. But it starts off bad, but then, it\u2019s not bad. And some of the other ones were just extremely embarrassing. Tim Ferriss: Wait. You can\u2019t dangle that hook in front of me. Were there any that \u2013 I can give some examples, too, if it makes you feel any better of book titles that are horrible. But were there any that you really liked that your girlfriend shot down? Tim Urban: You were like we could both do this embarrassing thing, but actually just you. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll kick it off. So, there was for what ended up being the Four Hour Work Week, there was Lifestyle Hustling. Glad I didn\u2019t use that. There was Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit, which was promptly vetoed by every retailer, thank God. There was Broadband and White Sand. It goes on. It goes on. So, sometimes, you need life to save you from yourself. Tim Urban: Those are kind of good. Those at least are sensical. They have some kind of \u2013 I understand two of those three at least. Tim Ferriss: All right. I\u2019ll take two out of three. That\u2019s partially because I\u2019m giving you the better of the worst. But your turn. Tim Urban: Miniatureking.com. I was in a deep Go Daddy spiral. If you\u2019ve ever been on one of these, it gets weird. It gets really weird. So, I\u2019m there, and I\u2019m into this idea of a king because I pictured the playing card king. And I\u2019m like miniature king, and I suddenly got obsessed with it. He has little legs, and he\u2019s very angry. He\u2019s very cranky. And there\u2019s like big, adult people walking by him, and he\u2019s on the ground. And he\u2019s like 2 feet tall. And my girlfriend was like, Jesus, absolutely not. But I got so addicted to the king concept that when I started Wait But Why, I made the logo a playing card king, and he\u2019s pissed off. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s amazing. You were like okay, kind of. Tim Urban: Yeah. I still kind of think miniature king could have worked. He\u2019s the mascot. He\u2019s cranky. Tim Ferriss: I like it. Tim Urban: But since then, what you can do, this happens all of the time \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Do you still own miniatureking.com? Tim Urban: I own miniatureking.com and about 15 others, yeah. There\u2019s a lot. I have Jesus Half Bro. I was going to do a site where I\u2019m Jesus\u2019s half brother, but he\u2019s not like the divine one. He\u2019s just born from Jesus\u2019s mom with some guy. And he\u2019s upset. Tim Ferriss: What could go wrong with that? Tim Urban: He\u2019s got all kinds of psychological issues going on. He\u2019s trying to figure out his career. Tim Ferriss: What were, if you look back because I look back, and I remember my first attempts at blogging at like the first 12 posts. And they\u2019ve, thankfully, mostly been forgotten over time. But what were your first \u2013 you had more practice than I did. You\u2019d already put in 300 reps. What were the first posts like? Do you remember any of the topics? Tim Urban: So, with my early blog, the topics were like they started with three sentence things. The first three were the title was Frankly, and then, it said if peeing in the shower is wrong, I don\u2019t want to be right. That was a blog post back in the day. Flash forward six years now, Wait But Why, I knew more. And I knew right away it was going to be like long and thorough because it was my own site, and I knew I could get into depth, if I could just go longer. So, at the beginning, I was anonymous, and I\u2019m sure you dealt with this, too. At some point, it\u2019s the get attention phase. So, anonymous, the only marketing platform I had was my personal Facebook page. And I started with seven ways to be insufferable on Facebook, which sounds like a buzz feed headline, but it was much more in depth. It got into the deep, dark psychology of why it\u2019s the wild west of social etiquette, and why we\u2019re all a very embarrassing version of ourselves on it, and what the different negative human qualities that come through on it. That was the very first one. I actually went to Easter Island for a month before I started Wait But Why, to just alone in the middle of nowhere write blog posts and pick my favorite one to put on first to just kind of figure out what I \u2013 and that was the winner. Tim Ferriss: Why did you pick Easter Island? Tim Urban: I like the fact that you could take a 2,000 mile yardstick and swing it around the island and not hit any people. That was cool to me. It was so isolated. Plus, the statues and the whole thing. And I was kind of like I\u2019ve always wanted to go. It was either there, or I was going to go to Lithuania in the winter and just creep out some small village. You can tell me a small village to creep out some time. And I actually talked to someone, and they were like you may actually arouse suspicion if you\u2019re this foreigner working every day in the caf\u00e9. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m just writing blog posts in isolation in a small, Lithuanian village. Tim Urban: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: It sounds like a George Clooney spy movie. Tim Urban: But I do want to do that, in the mid dead of winter, go to a small, cold village somewhere. Tim Ferriss: So, how did the blog post do, that one? Tim Urban: It did well. The very first one, I chose well. Tim Ferriss: How did you choose it relative to the other ideas that you had? Tim Urban: Trying to do some combo of something that I thought was true enough to me that represented the kind of quality I wanted to do but also that could go viral. Just beginning, how could it go viral because that\u2019s the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What year was this? Do you know? Tim Urban: In 2013, summer of 2013. So, that post did really well. It got 500,000 uniques in the first month. Tim Ferriss: Wow, that\u2019s an incredible number. Tim Urban: My whole last blog got 250,000 uniques in 6 years. So, this was like okay, longer. Getting into more serious topics and insulting people. It\u2019s on to something. Plus, what I didn\u2019t know, at the time, was that 2013 was a pretty magical year to be promoting content on Facebook. This was that \u2013 Facebook had decided let\u2019s show everyone just how powerful we are. This is why Buzz Feed exploded. Upworthy, you first heard of it in 2013, Viral Nova, these sites exploded because Facebook\u2019s algorithm, basically, said anyone posting content, we\u2019re going to show it to half a million people. I was in the right place at the right time, so, that was very helpful as well. Tim Ferriss: Just to maybe underscore one thing, for instance, when I started my first business, it was the golden age of Google Ad Words. It was shooting fish in a barrel, so in expensive. And then, when the Four Hour Work Week launched, it was at the same time at south by southwest when Twitter was effectively publicly debuted. There were big screens displaying all of the tweets in the world going on, which happened to be concentrated right in Austin, Texas because it was so small. And I would say that any time is the right time, in some way. So, these opportunities we\u2019re talking about, there are these opportunities right now. You just have to try to sniff them out, or just shoot in the dark and hope that you\u2019ll catch some tail wind. But everybody has, it seems with these stories, some element of luck involved. But you can improve the odds. That\u2019s just \u2013 Tim Urban: Right. There\u2019s like 10 waves throughout your \u2013 and one of the waves is cresting when you\u2019re starting. You don\u2019t know which one. But something is cresting at the time. And it\u2019s the perfect time to start something for some reason always. Tim Ferriss: Right. And in every story where you find a component of good timing, there\u2019s usually a component of bad timing, right? Like podcast app. You were paddling for the right wave, you were just doing it years too early. Tim Urban: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, I want to bring another figure, another character into this picture. Who is Winston? Can you tell us about Winston, please? Tim Urban: Winston is a close friend of mine. I met him in 2005 when he was 3 months old. I purchased him. And we lived happily together ever since. He was the size of a golf ball, at the time. Now, he\u2019s the size of a football, which is a huge upgrade for him. He\u2019s a tortoise. But he\u2019s very loveable. He\u2019s kind of my apartment screen saver. I\u2019m just sitting in what would be a still scene, and there\u2019s this moseying thing. This little, moseying dinosaur that moseys by. And who doesn\u2019t want that? You should all own a tortoise. It\u2019s weird that most of you don\u2019t own a tortoise. Tim Ferriss: Why did you name him Winston? Tim Urban: Because I thought he had a Churchill look to him. Or it\u2019s more that Churchill has a tortoise look to him. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sort of imagining, and I know they\u2019re not the same, but the sea turtles in Finding Nemo. And it\u2019s like, yeah, I can see that. Maybe a \u2013 Tim Urban: Yeah, but Winston has less charisma. But otherwise, yeah. Tim Ferriss: When I look at some of your posts, and I\u2019ve had my life very directly and profoundly impacted by some of your writing, particularly about time remaining with say parents or family. But when I look at some of your very research heavy posts, and it feels funny to call them posts, whether it\u2019s on AI or other topics that confuse a lot of people. We\u2019re talking about, for those of you who don\u2019t have any familiarity, in some cases, 50,000 words, 70,000 words. That\u2019s a book, everybody. Tim Urban: How long is the Four Hour Work Week? Tim Ferriss: Four Hour Work Week, that\u2019s a solid, now, it\u2019s deceptive to use page count, but that\u2019s how I think, it\u2019s about I want to say 420 pages or 430 pages. And it\u2019s not gigantic Dr. Seuss print. So, it\u2019s probably closer, if I\u2019m guessing, taking a stab, to the 100,000 or 120,000 word mark. I seem to have sort of word inflation with the books I write. They\u2019re getting bigger. But when you\u2019re tackling one of these post, what are some of the approaches or questions you ask that allow you to write something better and different? Because, presumably, many people are out there trying to learn about these various topics. And yet, you put out these posts that are the size of books that end up going viral. And you make complicated or seemingly complicated topics, very digestible. So, what is your approach to tackling a topic like AI? Tim Urban: Yeah. So, it\u2019s pretty simple for me. First of all, I do this kind of weird thing where I assume that my audience is I picture like a stadium full of me. So, it\u2019s narcistic fantasy. No, but it\u2019s just \u2013 I\u2019m just writing for \u2013 I\u2019m writing the exact post that I would be thrilled to get. So, I\u2019m just \u2013 that\u2019s my focus group right there, right in my head. And it\u2019s easy because we\u2019re all kind of special, unique people, except not really. There\u2019s like 100,000 copies of each of you out there somewhere. And the truth is, if I just write for me, there are a lot of people that have my exact weird taste. I just know that. So, I start there with kind of like who am I writing for. That makes it easy. And so, with something like AI, if there\u2019s a one through ten scale of how much you know about something, ten is world leading expert, and one has absolutely never heard of the term, I started at two or three on most stuff like most layman. I\u2019m a layman about everything. And so, then, I spend \u2013 just my curiosity is the driver. I pick topics I\u2019m excited to dig into. And I\u2019ll spend however long it takes. Sometimes, it\u2019s one day. Sometimes, it\u2019s three weeks. Sometimes, it\u2019s three months. But I\u2019ll take as long as I need to to learn enough to get me to maybe like a five or a six out of ten. I\u2019m not going to get a PhD. I\u2019m not going to spend five years getting myself to an eight or nine. But I\u2019m going to get myself to a six where I\u2019m like I can answer, basically, any question a layman asks me. I can do a Q&A with an audience on this topic for 10 hours, and I\u2019ll have a pretty good, solid answer to everything. Not that I know, necessarily, the truth of everything. But I know when the experts don\u2019t know the truth, and they\u2019re arguing. I know what the experts say about, basically, everything. So, I get myself to that level. And then, I think about so, experts have sometimes a hard time explaining because they haven\u2019t been at a two in decades sometimes. And they have this jargon. And they don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to be a two out of ten. I was there three weeks ago. I know exactly what my readers know about this. And I know exactly what \u2013 so, I just looked at the road I went down to get myself to a six. And I think about how could I do that road way more efficiently, if I could go do it again now? How could I do it in a much more fun way? And what\u2019s a fun story I could tell to bring readers from the two to a six? And so, that\u2019s my challenge then is to, basically, package the road I just went down for three weeks and make it an hour and a half package instead? Tim Ferriss: Okay. Not surprisingly, I have some follow up questions. Let\u2019s pick a subject. Have you written about crypto currency or blockchain? Tim Urban: Not yet. Tim Ferriss: Oh, perfect Tim Urban: Highly requested topic. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sure it is. The reason I ask is that much like AI, I have seen dozens of people attempt to explain, without misrepresenting, crypto currency and blockchain 101 for the masses. And it seems like almost every single attempt has failed. If you were to take that assignment on, where would you start? Tim Urban: So, I always start, I feel like, I\u2019m blindfolded in a room. And I\u2019m just trying to figure out where are even the walls here? Where is the furniture. I just want to start and understand what I even need to learn. So, I want to get a picture of the topic. And then, I can start diving in, going down various rabbit holes. And, usually, going outside of the topic. A rabbit hole outside of the topic is procrastination. But it also, often, gives you even more context. You\u2019ll find some metaphor out there that you end up bringing back. So, I\u2019ll just read and read and watch You Tube videos all on the internet. Tim Ferriss: How do you search? Reading, do you start at Wikipedia? Is that ground zero? Tim Urban: Yeah. I\u2019ll start at Wikipedia for just a basic foundation. Wikipedia is good at telling you where the walls are. Just letting you even understand the topic, in general. And letting you even understand the topic, in general. And Wikipedia has a lot of good knowledge on it. So, I\u2019ll go there, and then, I\u2019ll go to the bottom of Wikipedia and start clicking on the reference links. And I\u2019ll usually Google blockchain PDF, and you end up finding all of these superbly boring journal articles. And then, I\u2019ll go on You Tube. There are a lot of good people, smart teachers explaining stuff on You Tube. They\u2019re not going to explain the whole thing, usually. They\u2019re going to explain one part. Maybe I realized that, to understand blockchain, you need to first go down three layers. You need to build a foundation that begins with understanding what encryption is. You need to understand how encryption works and public keys and private keys. That\u2019s when you can start to, on top of that, build an understanding of what a ledger is that would be on these different computers and how it could possibly be secure. And by the time you get to blockchain, you\u2019re like eight layers up. So, I\u2019ll go find a You Tube video not on blockchain, but on encryption. And then, I\u2019ll find a You Tube video explaining what ledgers are, in general. I was reading about the history of ledgers and where they\u2019re used it the world, and encryption and how it was invented and how its evolved. And you just keep doing this. And the reason it\u2019s easy for me, this part, is because I\u2019m super curious. So, the more I learn, the less icky the topic gets. When the topic gets un-icky, it starts to be super delicious, the opposite of icky. And then, I can\u2019t read enough. And it\u2019s so fun suddenly. I\u2019m like I get it. And then, I just want to fill in the knowledge, and I want to watch a You Tube video I already know the answer to just to feel good about I already knew everything he\u2019s saying. this is great. But it solidifies it. And you hear seven different people articulate it in seven ways. And it just rounds out your understanding. And by the end, I start to be like I totally get this. Tim Ferriss: I find a video on You Tube. So, last I checked, which was not recently, You Tube was the second largest search engine in the world. There\u2019s a lot of great stuff. There\u2019s also a lot of nonsense. How do you search? So, what are the terms? How do you sort them? How do you go about picking properly? Tim Urban: Well, so, in Google, I will Google blockchain. Leave that in a window. Open a new window, and I\u2019ll Google bitcoin. New window, Ethereum. New window, crypto currency. New window, decentralized systems crypto. New window, crypto currency is bullshit. New window, whatever. And I\u2019ll just keep going. And I\u2019ll just think of anything. And then, each one of those windows I go back to, and I just hold down command, and I just click, click, click, click, click, click, and I have 10 tabs, 10 tabs, 10 tabs. And I just go and read everything. So, Google, again, I don\u2019t have to discern. I don\u2019t care if this [inaudible] article is going to be really useful or whether it\u2019s going to be accurate because the beginning process is just if you read 70 articles that may or may not have validity to them, the total sum of them actually you start to understand what do we know as a species? Where are we all agreeing? And then, where, clearly, a lot of people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Or there\u2019s this broad, this kind of dichotomy of a view in this one area. And there\u2019s these people, and there\u2019s these people. You Tube is kind of the same thing. I\u2019ll just start watching without discerning. Again, if you\u2019re a procrastinator, it\u2019s fantastic because you don\u2019t feel bad about just watching endlessly when it\u2019s taking all of your time, and it\u2019s not what you\u2019re supposed to do, and it feels great. So, I\u2019ll just watch. And then, of course, the sidebar starts to figure out \u2013 You Tube very quickly, and Google, will figure out what you\u2019re doing. And then, You Tube will start to put all of the things on the side for me. Plus, you start to see names you trust. Tim Ferriss: Make money in crypto currency in one week. Tim Urban: Well, it\u2019s funny, I\u2019m just writing a post now on like, we won\u2019t get into this, but like political stuff. And normally, my sidebar is like look how much of an idiot Trump is and his voters. And then, I\u2019m now trying to \u2013 I was Googling all of these conservative things because I\u2019m writing about both sides of stuff. And suddenly, the internet starts to indoctrinate me the other way. And they\u2019re like look at this wise Trump voter embarrass this \u2013 and I look over, and I\u2019m kind of like \u2013 and a couple of hours later, I\u2019m like Trump is the best. So, You Tube figures out your angle, and it will start to kind of feed you stuff. And then, there\u2019s certain names you trust. Hank and John Green. I trust them. [Inaudible], I trust them. CGP Gray, I trust him. So, you\u2019ll see certain names you trust. Minute Physics, great. So, there\u2019s also that, and the same with Google, of course. I\u2019ll trust certain sources more than others. Tim Ferriss: And once you\u2019ve ingested massive amounts of information, and you\u2019ve established a basic map for the territory, what do you think are the tools or approaches, anything at all, that help you to be so good at teaching these subjects in the way that you present it or structure your pieces? Tim Urban: Well, so, again, the starting point is I just went through this. And I teach myself. And I was bad at teaching myself because I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. So, now, the experience of a learner is fresh in my head. So, that\u2019s the first thing that\u2019s helpful. But then, I always, basically, with almost any explainer post like that, I just zoom out. Helicopter up. If you\u2019re looking at the land, and you see kind of like a beach, you don\u2019t know what it is. Is this a huge lake? Is this a little beach? Does it curve around? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s how I feel a lot of the articles on AI or crypto currency are. And then, the author might have a full understanding, but they\u2019re just describing the beach. So, you take a helicopter up, and you\u2019re like okay, wait a second. This is a big river. And there\u2019s a \u2013 and you go up further, and you\u2019re like oh, no, this is kind of a tributary that goes into the ocean. And now, you\u2019re kind of up where airplanes go and maybe even the International Space Station goes, and you\u2019re like okay, this is actually what\u2019s going on. So, I start there myself as a thinker and then, when I\u2019m trying to explain, I\u2019m just going to start there, which is why people make fun of me because I\u2019ll write about three different things. And they all start at the big bang by the time I\u2019m done with them. I have to, basically, go back. But, sometimes, it\u2019s helpful. By the time you get from the big bang to now, suddenly, we can see the whole coastline, and now, the beach suddenly makes sense. And I try to make it fun also because who wants to like \u2013 so many \u2013 the journal articles, the experts, they\u2019re not writing to entertain. And it\u2019s just bad. It\u2019s like textbooks and school where it\u2019s so bad. They were so boring. Part of the reason I like You Tube is because people who end up with a lot of views on You Tube that are going to end up on my recommended thing, they have an eye for entertainment. So, I try to do the same thing as well. Tim Ferriss: And if you were to ask say friends of yours who are fans of your writing what your ingredients for entertaining are, what might they say? Or to just ask you. I don\u2019t want you to be overly self deprecating. I\u2019m just trying to figure out what makes it entertaining? Because it is, clearly, entertaining. Tim Urban: Again, entertaining means 10 different things to 10 different people. Every post, I get nine emails from mothers in Kansas angry at me for swearing. But it depends on it\u2019s, I think, trying to add sense of humor into basically everything. Treating it light, good metaphors. For me, lots of visuals. I\u2019m a visual learner. If I see a block of text, and I\u2019m just scrolling down, I\u2019m kind of upset. It feels like homework. But if I scroll down, and every few paragraphs, there\u2019s a chart, there\u2019s a comic, I\u2019m suddenly like okay, this is fun. I\u2019m kind of excited. And so, that\u2019s how I think. So, I try to do that. That\u2019s what I would want. So, there\u2019s so many things where you can just do a funny stick drawing or really good diagram. And it\u2019s just way clearer and sticks in your head more. If I\u2019m going to talk about procrastination, I can talk about the limbic system and talk about how it works and our flight or fight zone. Or I can make an instant gratification monkey because that is, essentially, what it is. And that\u2019s more memorable and I think more fun to read, at the time. Tim Ferriss: So, you\u2019ve really, in my opinion, exhibited a mastery for taking what many people would consider extremely intimidating subjects, many of them involved in forging what we\u2019re going to experience as a species as the future. So, I\u2019d like to talk about the future for a second. And I want to read a quote here. I believe that you wrote or said this, so correct me if I\u2019m wrong. \u201cI always thought the future would be intense. But now, I think the future is going fully fucking crazy.\u201d Okay. So, what are a few things that you\u2019re excited about or see coming down the pike in the future? It doesn\u2019t have to be one or two. It could be many. Tim Urban: It is going to be crazy, and here\u2019s why. So, the first thought a lot of people have is that it\u2019s na\u00efve to think that the future is going to \u2013 we\u2019re at the end of times. Everyone thinks that. You\u2019re just another na\u00efve person that thinks they live in a special time. And the reason we all have that instinct is because we\u2019re \u2013 biology moves very slowly. It evolves very, very slowly. So, 50,000 years is nothing in biology and evolution. So, we\u2019ve barely changed. Meaning, we\u2019re still a baby born today is a baby that is perfectly optimized to live in a tribe in Ethiopia in 50,000 BC. And everything about it is ready for survival in that world. But what we\u2019ve done is taken that baby away from its home planet and brought it to another planet, which is the earth in 2017. And that baby isn\u2019t made very well for this world. None of us are. So, the first thing to think about is just that a lot of our instincts and a lot of our intuitions are actually going to be inherently wrong. We\u2019re going to be living in a delusion that was helpful back then and today just is not great. So, the reason \u2013 the way you can cut through tis and actually see reality when that baby is not \u2013 seeing reality isn\u2019t helpful to that baby. Fitting in with the tribe is and believing what the tribe believes is. So, today, we want to see reality. So, you can just look at the facts sometimes. So, imagine that \u2013 this is going to be a long answer. Imagine that \u2013 I have a lot to say about this. Imagine that the \u2013 this is what I\u2019m saying about the zoom out. Answers can\u2019t be short in my head. So, imagine that human history is about 1,000 centuries \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Get comfortable, folks. Tim Urban: Settle in. So, 1,000 centuries of human history, 100,000 years. So, each two centuries is a page in a book. How many pages is this? Tim Ferriss: About 700 pages. Tim Urban: So, 500 pages. Actually, whatever. They\u2019re finding older, human mermaids, so, fine. So, 140,000 years, every page in this book that you\u2019re holding is 200 years in human history. So, Page 1 through 650 of that book, hunter gathers. If you\u2019re an alien reading this book to understand what happened on this planet, you are bored. This is really boring. Page 650, 10,000 years ago, you have the agriculture revolution. Wait. So, suddenly, people are coming together and forming cities. They\u2019re starting to actually form larger civilizations. They have a collective intelligence that\u2019s starting to form. They can compare notes. They can kind of create the knowledge tower that is bigger than any one of them. It\u2019s very interesting stuff. So, that\u2019s 50 pages ago. Then, it gets boring again for a while. Page 690 out of 700, the little tiny end of the book here, you\u2019ve have Jesus. You have 693, you have the advent of Islam. The Roman Empire happens two pages ago. It\u2019s already done. In 697, you have Imperialism. For the first time, you have countries. There\u2019s this new thing that happened in the last three pages. Page 698, you have the enlightenment, you have the renaissance. You have things like this. They discover that there\u2019s galaxies, telescope. Page 699, you finally get to the beginning of the US and the beginning of the constitutional democracies. Now, Page 700 happens, which is from about 200 years ago to today. So, the beginning of Page 700, the alien turns the page, industrial revolution happens. Big deal, big change. And as he reads down the page, things start to go crazy. You start to have \u2013 in 699 pages this alien has read, this boring ass species has communicated through letters and talking. He was excited about language 500 pages ago. Now, he\u2019s bored. Smoke signals, firing a canon ball in the air, stuff like that. Suddenly, on Page 700, we go to the space station. We have the moon. We have airplanes. We have cars just on Page 700. So, 699 pages, we only communicate through \u2013 we have this kind of simple transportation, communication. Now, we have Face Time. We have telephone. We have the internet. Crazy. Less than a billion people for the first 699 pages. On Page 700 alone, we cross the one, two, three, four, five, six and seven billion person marks. So, the alien is reading. And his wife comes in and is like hey, we\u2019re going to have dinner. And he\u2019s like shut up. This is the most riveting thing suddenly. He\u2019s like what is about to happen to this species? This is crazy what just happened on this page. This is when we\u2019re born. We\u2019re born at the end of Page 700. This is why when someone says what do you think the future is going to be, I\u2019m like Page 701. And he\u2019s like what the hell is this guy talking about. Page 701, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not going to be nuts. Tim Ferriss: This shit just goes bonkers. Tim Urban: Yeah. The first three sentences of Page 701 will take us to 2025 when they predict that AI is going to, basically, infiltrate every single industry and part of our lives the way electricity did in a 10 year span in the 1880\u2019s. That\u2019s the first three sentences. So, to me, I see revolutions. The first half of Page 701, the first quarter of Page 701, I see revolutions in VR, AR. I see revolutions in AI. I see revolutions in brain machine interfaces. We\u2019re going to be able to think thoughts to each other. It\u2019s way cooler for language, for the first time. I see revolutions in genetic stuff. Your grandkids are going to be like, so, you just had a baby and hoped it was a good baby? It\u2019s going to seem crazy. It\u2019s going to seem so primitive. And you can just go on and on and on with things. How about this one? What are the major leaps for life? You can count on one hand for all of life. Simple cell to complex cell, big one. Complex cell to multi cell, big one. We have animals now. Ocean to land, big one. I would say the fourth that fits on this same list is going from one planet to multi planets as a civilization. That\u2019s happening in the next decade with space. No one is talking about it yet, but they will be. Just the fact that we\u2019re going to witness, in our lifetimes, one of the great leaps for all of life. This isn\u2019t normal. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, I want to talk about extra planetary, just a couple of curious notions that I\u2019ve been bouncing around in my own head. If you had to bet on more humans inhabiting Mars or inhabiting space stations that don\u2019t have to conquer a separate gravity, where would you bet? Because there are competing camps, or at least technologists who are looking at say inhabiting other planets, or saying no, that makes no sense because now, you\u2019re dealing with a separate environment, gravitational field, etc. We\u2019re going to just build space stations. Tim Urban: I would say Mars, for a while. Mars is probably going to have a million people in the next five or six decades. And then, it will, eventually, probably end up at a billion people. But I think space stations, in the long run, way better. It\u2019s going to seem really crappy to be on a planet. Being on a planet is going to seem very old school and very kind of rough compared to the space stations we can \u2013 imagine dealing with weather. It\u2019s going to seem crazy that you\u2019d have to deal with weather, that you had to deal with things like climate change. It\u2019s just not our problem. We have to deal with bugs. I\u2019d be so happy that there\u2019s no bugs on the space station. So, I think, in the long run, that. But I have a more important question, which is are you going to go to Mars? Tim Ferriss: No. Tim Urban: No? Tim Ferriss: Well, not in the near term. I don\u2019t want to be the first monkey shot to Mars. I\u2019ll let quite a few people work out the kinks on that one. We can\u2019t even figure out how to upgrade IOS without replacing I with fucking images. I\u2019m going to let someone shoot me to Mars? No, not early, no. Tim Urban: Okay. Now, picture it\u2019s 20 years from now, and every 26 months, earth laps Mars, and they end up next to each other. That\u2019s when you have this window to go. So, every 26 months, there\u2019s going to be a colonial fleet heading there and another fleet coming back, bringing people back, round trip tickets. Tim Ferriss: All though different people on the legs, right? Tim Urban: Exactly. And there\u2019s going to be first class things. There will be like fancy people. But everyone will be jumping around, bouncing around with the gravity. It sounds great like a zero gravity cruise ship. So, the question is, for you, it\u2019s 2038. Or 2045, and it\u2019s been proven, for the last 20 trips back and forth, no one has gotten hurt. It\u2019s totally safe. Tim Ferriss: Would I visit? Tim Urban: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the total time invested, at this point, in the transportation? Tim Urban: Let\u2019s say the shortest round trip you can do is a 52 month. Tim Ferriss: I would strongly consider it. I heard Jeff Bezos say recently on stage, before you think about going to Mars, spend a month in Antarctica. That\u2019s a cake walk. Tim Urban: Oh, Antarctica is way better than Mars. Antarctica but 15 to 20 degrees colder. You can\u2019t breathe the air. And you can\u2019t be outside in the sun without a radiation suit. Tim Ferriss: So, I think it depends a lot on the brochure of Mars Club Med that I receive. Tim Urban: Yeah, it\u2019s not good. Tim Ferriss: All right. Shifting gears a little bit, AI, do you think it is an existential threat or not? And if so, what is the time horizon for it becoming an imminent existential threat? Tim Urban: So, this is one of the great questions. AI is probably the subject I\u2019ve talked to most experts on. So, I\u2019m not an expert, but I really know what the experts think. And I try to keep up to date because they change their minds a lot. Tim Ferriss: No, we\u2019ll be fine. No, we\u2019ll be fine now that we\u2019re all dead. Tim Urban: What I find is very few people who don\u2019t think this is going to basically take over everything. The question is when. And I was surprised that even the people that are pessimistic, they kind of think it might be 100 years from now. Most people think 50, 30, and people that Deep Mine these days at Google, which is like the leading AI company now, they\u2019re saying things like 10. And when I say 10, 10 until what? I\u2019m talking about before any of this moment happens \u2013 to understand AI, you have to think about two things. There\u2019s narrow intelligence, and there\u2019s general intelligence. \u00a0So, humans have general intelligence. We\u2019re smart across the board. We have social skills. We have creativity. We can understand math. We can read. We can be creative. We can learn from experience. You just name anything, and humans can kind of learn how to be smart there. But when you think about AI, AI is way better than any human at the things it\u2019s good at like chess, the world chess master. And it\u2019s the world master at everything that it does well. But it\u2019s only good at that one thing. So, there\u2019s AI on your phone. There\u2019s AI in your car. There\u2019s AI running most stuff, at this point, but it\u2019s only good at one thing. So, the question is when will AI gain that same breadth that we have? When will it become broadly smart? And until then, it\u2019s still going to change the world. It\u2019s still going to take a huge amount of jobs and create a whole bunch more. So, it\u2019s going to be a massive group of changes that happen even before we get general intelligence. But the question that I was referring to before is when do we get to this level where AI is not smart like we are but way, way smarter, what Nick Bostrom calls super intelligence where it\u2019s as smarter than us as we are than monkeys. Yeah. So, basically, if you picture like not only can a monkey not build this room, or when you look out in the night sky, and you see little lights moving around, humans are so smart. We put those there. We put airplanes and satellites in the night sky. So, not only can a monkey not do that, you can show the monkey the lights of this building, and he can\u2019t even understand that you did it. He just will think that it\u2019s just there. That\u2019s just a moving star. So, we\u2019re talking about something that not only can we not do what this thing can do, we can\u2019t even understand that it did it, even if it tried to explain it. That\u2019s how smart this thing is. It\u2019s really crazy concept. So, things that we think are hard like curing disease, poverty, climate change, anything we consider a challenge, easy, piece of cake for the AI. So, that\u2019s the really exciting side. And then, there\u2019s what if we\u2019re not in control of it the way we want to be, not that it\u2019s going to be evil. That\u2019s this anthropomorphization that people do. They try to apply human stuff to this thing that\u2019s not human. But when you build a house, and there\u2019s an ant hill there, you\u2019re not like death to the ants. You just built a house, and they were in the way, so you killed them. Big deal. The fear is that the AI is doing its thing and that we\u2019re kind of in the way. And we programmed it in a way that we didn\u2019t think of this thing. But now, it\u2019s too powerful. We can\u2019t change it. And we\u2019re toast. Or it gets annoyed that we\u2019re doing something to it that it doesn\u2019t want, and we\u2019re toast. So, you have some high stakes here, which is why, basically, we\u2019re going to have God on earth because we can play God to every other animal right now, even a chimp. Chimps are really smart, until we put it in a cage. Now, what are you going to do? We have a gun. We have a taser. We can poison its food. Chimps are nothing compared to our God-like ability because we have a little intelligence gap over them. Little in the scheme of things. When this thing has a big intelligence gap over us. It truly can play God to us. It truly can play God to us. So, the question is is it a good God that can solve all of our problems? Or is it one of those dick gods in the old testament like that guy? So, this is what they\u2019re talking about. This is why AI safety is so important. But most of the money and time is going into AI development right now Tim Ferriss: So, last questions, and then, we\u2019ll go to audience questions. How do you view happiness, just to bring it back to things that we may be able to influence, at least speaking for myself and a lot of people in this room? How do you view or define happiness for yourself, if you do at all? Tim Urban: I kind of think of there\u2019s two kinds of happiness that you have to kind of deal with both. One is micro happiness like are your Tuesdays good? Are you generally having a good Tuesday? And then, there\u2019s like macro happiness. Are you present? Are you like yeah, I\u2019ll dig into this current life for 20 years. I love it. Or are you like I was, for nine years after college, which is like I\u2019m doing this now, but I really want to like \u2013 I should be doing \u2013 and that\u2019s macro happiness. So, I think you have to worry about both. I think that the most important one to get right, at the beginning at least, is macro. I think if your macro happiness isn\u2019t there, you\u2019re going to feel frustrated. You\u2019re going to have a cloud over you. And then, I think you can work on micro happiness, which is about lifestyle. This is what your so good at. And I think a lot of people here really both kind of happinesses, they look to you because you have a lot of good advice. But I think with micro, you focus so hard on just really crushing a Tuesday. And I think but all life is is literally a Tuesday again and again, and then, you die. So, crushing the Tuesday is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s the title of my next book. Tim Urban: Let\u2019s get good at it. Tim Ferriss: White sand and Tuesdays. Tim Urban: So, yeah, but the thing that\u2019s hard is a lot of times, we assume that it\u2019s the external world. We have to succeed. We have to get this relationship, and then, we\u2019ll be \u2013 this is kind of clich\u00e9, but we know that it\u2019s messing with your internal expectations. It\u2019s getting your mind in the right place and kind of seeing reality, and seeing what is your ego, and what is your fear, and what is worrying about judgment, and what is actually real that matters to you, and realizing that a lot of the perceived risk isn\u2019t really dangerous, and a lot of the perceived reward isn\u2019t really gratifying. And it\u2019s all there in front of you, if you can just look past your primate self with your very rational, intelligent self and just see it, and then, learn to internalize it. Often, suddenly, the happinesses become very clear how to work themselves out. and it\u2019s \u2013 often, we end up spending all of our time trying to get to those happinesses with the primate kind of self in charge. And that usually doesn\u2019t get us there. Tim Ferriss: So, to add to that, reality minus expectations. Is that a useful framework for defining happiness, do you think? Tim Urban: Yeah. So, you say your happiness is like an equation, reality minus expectations is your happiness. And so, you can work on two things. You can work on improving your reality, or you can work on not lowering but kind of refining your expectations to reflect what actually matters to you, which will almost always end up with them lowering, in a certain sense, and maybe going up in another sense. But the classic trap, of course, is you\u2019re in a way better place than you were 10 years ago, but you\u2019re just as unhappy because your hedonic treadmill concept is this term that psychologists use that your happiness goes up because something really good happens. Even the little examples. You buy something new, and you wake up in the morning like my iPhone X10 or whatever, and you\u2019re all happy. And every day, that goes down. And six days later, it\u2019s just your stupid iPhone again. But we use this in a macro sense. You get the new job. You finally get into a really good relationship. You work it out, or you have a sick friend or a parent, and then, they get healthy. And wow. So, the way to get off the treadmill is obvious. Just obsess over gratitude. What I have, what I want. And looking up, you\u2019re going to be really unhappy. And the mountain keeps growing underneath you, but you\u2019re not even looking at it. You\u2019re just looking up all of the time. It\u2019s going to seem like everything sucks. If you\u2019re looking down, you\u2019re like look at this mountain. It\u2019s amazing. Look at all of the things I have. You\u2019re going to be really happy. So, the gratitude things are really. All of the things you\u2019re supposed to write the three good things that happened that day. Every night before you go to bed, write three good things that happened and why they happened. The reason why psychologists say this is good is because it trains your brain to all day be thinking what\u2019s good, and I have to do this thing tonight. What\u2019s good? And suddenly, you\u2019re looking down at all of these things that are good in your life as opposed to looking up at what sucks. What sucks about this situation. How is the world wronging me, which is a pure recipe for unhappiness. Tim Ferriss: Okay. I\u2019m going to try to put a little icing on top just to add to that, which is I was reading recently about some of the supposedly objectively assessed happiest places on earth. And if you look at them, three of them are Costa Rica [Spanish]. Okay. I\u2019m screwing up my gender already. At least I did it in Spanish. So, moving on, I\u2019m going to move on quickly. Costa Rica, Singapore, any Singaporeans here that want to shout? Okay. I\u2019m all for it. You don\u2019t see it as much in Singapore. And then, Denmark. Tim Ferriss: All right. You can write a letter. I love Norway. But I will rely on National Geographic. You can write them an angry letter. They are very communicative. So, Norway also. But I can only speak to the Danes, but I will give you the official gold medal. But the silver medal for the Danes. And I want to point out a couple of things knowing people in all three places that, in Singapore, there\u2019s very much an optimization for improving your reality. And it\u2019s very sort of achievement focused. And there\u2019s a large economic component. Nonetheless, the various combination of factors lead them to be in the very top. On the opposite side of that equation, or at least on the alternate side, you have the Danes. And I know a lot of Danes. And I remember, at one point, without even bringing up any of this, I said you guys are, apparently, really happy. Why do you think that is? And as a group, they said we have really low expectations. I was like wow. That\u2019s interesting. Let me noodle on that. And then, I think Costa Rica is kind of squarely in the middle in a lot of respects. So, stuff to ponder. Work on both. And also, it just struck me that given all of the talk about stoicism and so on that I tend to beat people over the head with, stoicism, in a lot of respects, I would view as a complete philosophical system that checks a lot of boxes but does focus quite a bit on refining your expectations and preparing for the worst case scenario. So, I often add quite a healthy dose of epicureanism and so on, which is more on the opposite side. In any case, Tim, thank you so much. And we\u2019re going to jump into some audience questions. Please give a hand. And we will definitely be doing some individual hellos. But let me jump in and see what we have here. And I suspect there might be some curve balls/bear traps that I don\u2019t want to step into. So, let me see what we have here. Bear with. All right. You\u2019re 20, you have 3 to 6 months pre-job/post college. I take that to mean three to six months after graduation to do whatever, no financial social commitments, and you\u2019ve already read Tim\u2019s books. Thank you for that. How do you spend your time to maximize wellbeing and develop perspective? Aman from Paris. Wellbeing and develop perspective, three to six months. Now, you may have already done this. Where is Aman? Is Aman here? Hey, how\u2019s it going. So, you may have already done this. So, if I were giving advice to the normal American audience for that, I would say travel for those three to six months, go to countries where you do not speak the language. Get deliberately lost in places that are safe perhaps like Japan or Costa Rica in most places. And for wellbeing and developing perspective, wellbeing would mean deliberately exposing yourself to people who are worse off, maybe at least financially, than yourself. So, spending part of that time volunteering, for instance, in those three to six months. And then, that will simultaneously help you to develop many, many different perspectives. That would be just speaking as someone whose life was changed completely by a number of overseas experiences, which I had starting at age 16 or 17. I had never really spent time outside of the US. That would be my recommendation. Tim, do you have any other thoughts? Tim Urban: I think that\u2019s right in line with what I would have said, which is, basically, traveling, to me, is another way to zoom out because you\u2019re just looking at your life from far away. It\u2019s like you\u2019re not going there to look at your life, but you end up thinking about your life. And, for some reason, being far away, being out of your comfort zone and out of your element, you just have fresh eyes on your whole situation. You can have this perspective. It\u2019s like going in a helicopter and looking at it from up there. And a lot of things make sense. And then, I would also say couple that with kind of like a hard zoom in on reality, which I think you get from \u2013 I might have said wait tables, work construction. Just do something where you\u2019re just around working people. And it just reminds you what work is like, what reality is like, what adults go through. And then, that can help you figure out where you\u2019re about to be and what you want to do. Tim Ferriss: For sure. And the travel advice I would not limit to someone just getting out of college. I think everybody, when possible, should have that experience because the benefits outlast the trip because what will happen to most people, especially if you put yourself in very foreign environments where perhaps you can\u2019t even read what is written, Japan, China, many different examples, whether it\u2019s Cyrillic, Arabic, doesn\u2019t matter. And you observe different customs. What happened, to me at least, in Japan, for instance, which was my first real time abroad for a year as an exchange student. The only person who looks like this in a school uniform in a high school of 5,000 Japanese kids. Pretty easy Where\u2019s Waldo game. But I was like they drive on the other side of the street? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Then, I was like wait a second, maybe we don\u2019t make any sense. They take a shower before they get into the bath tub? That doesn\u2019t make any \u2013 wait a second. It makes perfect sense. And I got back, and I realized how many rules we follow are just made up. They\u2019re just totally made up. Very fragile, socially reinforced illusions that we just reinforce. And that\u2019s very liberating because you realize wait a minute, if all of these different cultures do thing differently, maybe I don\u2019t have to go there to do things differently. I can do that here. Then, you start to really question assumptions. And you become, in my experience, more experimental. Let\u2019s go to another question. What trends, industries, topics are you most excited about right now? Patrick. Patrick, is Patrick here? Hey, Patrick. All right. I like that hi Tim applies to both of us. It simplifies matters. What\u2019s trends, industries, topics am I most excited about right now. Speaking for myself, trends, I\u2019m not watching very closely. I have trouble explaining why. I suppose I\u2019m not trying to capitalize on any trends because I feel like, particularly having left Silicon Valley and having moved to Austin, which I love on almost every level, if I am spotting trends that I hope to capitalize on, by the time you see it, you\u2019re too late, generally speaking. So, I\u2019m not paying a lot of attention to trends. Industries, I am interested just almost from an academic standpoint, in space travel, not so much from a personal experiential standpoint. But, specifically, looking at inhabiting planets versus building space stations. That debate is interesting to me because you have some of the smartest humans of the last 50 or 100 years, arguably, with very, very different viewpoints. And whenever that happens in any field, I\u2019m really interested. You see that in quite a few places. Topics, I would say, and this might be considered a trend, I\u2019m hoping to turn it into a trend, which would be scientific research using current cutting edge technologies to re-examine both psychedelics and MDMA, which I wouldn\u2019t strictly consider, in the traditional sense, a psychedelic for applications to very debilitating, serious conditions ranging from PTSD to treatment resistant depression, end of life anxiety, and so forth. So, I\u2019ve taken most of my energy and capital that went into startups and redirecting that to scientific research at Johns Hopkins, hopefully other places like UCSF, NYU also that are taking these compounds that have been used very, very wisely, I think, in certain contexts for millennia by various civilizations and applying a scientific lens to understand the mechanisms of action and the risks involved, quite frankly. But how they can be less politicized and stigmatized for unscientific reasons and examined so that we have a better understanding of why they do what they do, which can be pretty incredible. What about you? Trends, industries, topics that you\u2019re excited about right now? Tim Urban: Definitely, some of those. I agree with you on getting the stigma off of perspective altering drugs. But I would also add there\u2019s a lot of cool things going on in the field that also has a stigma called life extension. And the stigma is it just seems like it\u2019s just narcistic, rich, white guys that want to live forever. But the truth is, and people think it\u2019s vain and this narcistic kind of thing. But really, you could just reframe it as, if you just cure or learn how to manage four things that kill people, basically, which is like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, it just means that \u2013 and other things going on in health like we can just live a lot longer, and higher quality later years, who doesn\u2019t want that? It\u2019s this knee jerk reaction that makes people not even want to put money or time into this industry. But I just feel like there were definitely people back when humans lived on an average to 40, it would have been like death at 40 is the lot of man. Living to 80 \u2013 like now, we\u2019re all happy about that. No one wants to go back. If suddenly 140 was the new 90, and 90 was the new 50, who is not happy about that? So, and we always say because, at that point, you\u2019re done. Well, that\u2019s only because we got used to that. We\u2019re managing our own expectations. If we all died at 35, I would be like, well, it\u2019s been good. But I\u2019m not like that. I\u2019m all ambitious and excited because I think I have more decades. So, I think that there\u2019s a lot going on. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife are one of the teams that are trying to cure all diseases by the end of the century. This is just a machine. And the diseases are just a glitch inside the machine. If we can have enough nano tech and really fancy AI, medicine and everything, we can go in there and fix it. This is a fantastic development. The most heart breaking thing is someone that you love died especially early. Let\u2019s work on that. So, I think there\u2019s a lot going on there. But I think that a lot more would be going on, if the stigma of this as kind of like a narcistic pursuit would just go away. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. To comment on one thing there, in terms of the narcistic rich people, everyone should want the narcistic millionaires and billionaires to spend as much money as possible on this. You want them to be the people who create the economies of scale for everybody else. And many of the things we take for granted now like recycling started off being very hoity-toity, affluent experiments. And you want them to be spending millions of dollars on something that, in 10 years, is going to be available for $50.00 at CVS. Tim Urban: Plumbing, like sanitation, these things were all rich people things for a while. And then, everyone benefits tremendously from them. People also get mad. They think this is just going to benefit the rich. It\u2019s this unfair thing where super rich people will be able to live longer. It\u2019s like yeah, for a while. And then, it trickles to everybody because the cost comes down as we get better, so, get over it. Tim Ferriss: On that note, moving on. If you want to read some I think very interesting thinking related to what might account to life extension, or at least death prevention, Dr. Peter Attia is one to pay attention to, one of my favorite people. What is the name of the city everyone must visit before they die? Thanks for everything, Steve Correll, not to be confused with Steve Carrell the CA \u2013 it\u2019s a great name spelled differently. On my list, I would have to go with Tokyo because it has such an unusual combination of safety, cleanliness, extreme weirdness, and incomprehensibility, even to someone who speaks Japanese that it provides a really unique \u2013 I think I just used that twice, and I\u2019m going to get shit from friends who love to heckle me for using modifiers on unique. They\u2019re like, no, there\u2019s no such thing as very unique. Okay. I\u2019m going to say it again just to annoy them. It\u2019s a very unique opportunity to feel extreme discomfort and confusion with elation with next to no real harmful consequences. So, I think that provides an awesome learning opportunity and just a fun trip. So, I would say Tokyo is very high on the list. Tim Urban: You stole my answer again. I was just in Japan all summer. And it\u2019s like going to another planet. And you\u2019re like how does this civilization live? And you\u2019re on another planet. That\u2019s how different it is. And just isolated. Western culture has infiltrated so many places, and it just hasn\u2019t really there. And they just have done everything their own way. And so, you\u2019re like how does the cab door open. Oh, it opens by itself. Then, they get in, and it closes by itself. That\u2019s really cool. So, to give a different answer, I\u2019ll say Hanoi, Vietnam just because crossing the street is just crazy. So, there\u2019s like bikes, motor bikes, just a sea of them going by. And there\u2019s no stop lights. And it doesn\u2019t stop. And what you do as a walker is you just walk. It\u2019s like Indiana Jones walking over the thing. You just walk, and you just \u2013 and they figure it out. And it\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s like you feel like you\u2019re God walking on water or something weird. You just walk out, and nothing happens. But the thing you don\u2019t want to do is be a freaked out tourist that stops because then you\u2019re doing something they can\u2019t anticipate. But you\u2019ve got to try this. Tim Ferriss: Steady, well-paced strides, confident. Tim Urban: Yes. Unknown Speaker: [Inaudible] Tim Urban: Is it the same there? I didn\u2019t go down there? Unknown Speaker: [Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: You spent some time in Ho Chi Minh. Unknown Speaker: [Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: Go with the flow, or else you die. Good advice. My goodness. That one would take us both several hours knowing the two of us. I apologize to the person\u2019s whose name I will not read. All right. Dear Tim, that applies to both of us, regarding two crappy pages per day, I\u2019ll explain what that means, how do you structure your days and weeks when you are working on a book? Thanks, Jeane or Jeanie, I\u2019m not sure of the E. Jeanie: Either way is fine. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll go with both. I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. So, the two crappy pages per day, for those who don\u2019t know, was advice that I received regarding writing and working on a book, which can be, in my personal experience, a very daunting, intimidating task. And I would get frozen for days or weeks. And I\u2019d try to write something, and it wouldn\u2019t be perfect. And I\u2019d throw it out. And a mentor of mine, or an author I knew, said your quota should be two crappy pages per day. And he told me the story about IBM and how they demolished the competition by exceeding every sales quota every quarter. And just absolutely steamrolling everyone for a long time. And he asked me do you know why that is, and I said no. And he said because the quotas were low. And then, people were unintimidated to pick up the phone to make the calls. And you can do the same thing with yourself with writing. And you do that by making your bar for successful day two crappy pages. That\u2019s it. Even if you throw them both out and you never use them, you\u2019ve won the day if you have two crappy pages. And, of course, over time, there are days when you just get your two crappy pages. And they are really, truly terrible. Then, there are other days where you overshoot. You\u2019re in the flow, and you get 10, 15, 20 pages. You don\u2019t need so many of those to eventually put together what can become a book. In terms of structuring my days and so on, I\u2019ll be super, super specific here because the weeks and months, basically, look identical. And it\u2019s just copy and paste of this particular day. I realized for myself that I benefit greatly given historical predisposition to bipolar and all of these various things. That\u2019s just written in my code. It\u2019s a whole other story. But it\u2019s kind of laughable how I\u2019m predisposed my family is that writing your sunshine is really important. So, I write books, generally, during summer months. And my day involves getting up, not super early, but for me, respectably early, which would be say 9:00 a.m. or 9:30. Before the sun is setting. And I wake up, I meditate for 20 to 22 minutes, which would be, typically, transcendental meditation or some type of guided meditation. Then, I jump in the water because I\u2019m on Long Island. I jump in the water to wake up. I might do a little bit of swimming. I hop out. I already have pages from the night before that I want to edit. I will edit during the day, but I do my pros generation at night. That\u2019s just when I have the best output. But I can edit, do that grunt work during the day. I have printed out pages. I will go into a sauna, which requires all sorts of trickery because you start sweating on the pages. But go into a sauna, and I will hand edit those pages. Then, I come out, take a quick shower. I have a very small breakfast of some type, typically, macadamia nuts and some eggs. Very, very small. And I continue to work, very often, at a treadmill desk. And the treadmill desk works during this period of time at a very slow pace because, say in the case of Tribe of Mentors, I\u2019m handing outreach and editing. I\u2019m not going to do original drafts and composition at the treadmill desk. I will work at the treadmill desk, this is literally the exact day. And this won\u2019t take hours to explain. Then, around say noon or 1:00 p.m., hop on a bike with a researcher or someone that I have hired to be with me in the same house at all times. Why is this important? I realized that writing is very isolating for me. And it can catalyze a lot of negative mental states and downward spirals because I feel alone. So, I have someone physically there, even though we could probably do the work remotely. They have to be optimistic, which, fortunately, my researcher is. Everything to him is hand clapping, amazing. Really good influence to have around. So, we both get on a bike. So, you\u2019ll notice there are little bursts of physical exercise inserted in the day. Get on bikes. Ride to this very mediocre deli, and we have Mediterranean wraps every day. For those interested, it is whole wheat tortilla with chicken, humus, tomato, avocado added, always extra cost. And we eat our Mediterranean wraps, and I have unsweetened ice tea plus sparkling water. And we will work there until say 5:00 or 6:00, the sun starts to set. Jump on the bikes, sometimes head to the bay, jump in the water again, head home. And then, have a snack, work for an additional two to three hours, then, go to dinner. There are two or three restaurants that we go to, that\u2019s it. Those are the rotations. And for all of these restaurants, I\u2019ll give a pro tip, Jesus, what a long answer that I said wasn\u2019t going to be long, all right. Pro tip for people who might want to do this. Now, it\u2019s late. We\u2019re going out late. We\u2019re having dinner at 9:00. A lot of these kitchens close at say 9:30, 10:00. What does that mean? Staff is going to be fucking pissed that we\u2019re coming in right as the door is about to close. And I know this because I worked in service jobs as bus boy and waiter in restaurants forever. I get it. So, here\u2019s what you do. You have three restaurants. You know you\u2019re going to be going to them for a few weeks or a few months. You go to the same restaurant for dinner three nights in a row. And then, the next restaurant, same place, three nights in a row. Each night, you buy rounds of tequila over and over again for every person who works in the restaurant. Front of house and back of house, really important. These people will now love you. And they will let you hang out for an extra hour, hour and a half. This is really key. So, we do this. Then, we go home, not too much tequila. And we\u2019ll continue to prepare things for the next day, go to bed around 1:00 a.m., and then, it\u2019s Ground Hog Day over and over again. That\u2019s it. And there are \u2013 very often, I would say every other day, some type of kettle bell swings or exercise that is done immediately before leaving to dinner. And it\u2019s just that day over and over and over again. Yes, I see a raised hand. Unknown Speaker: [Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yes. So, important clarifying question, do I work where we have lunch? Yes. There are outdoor picnic tables, and we will sit down and work outside. That\u2019s actually a fairly key point. But you have to have a high tolerance for mosquitoes and tics because it\u2019s eastern Long Island. So, caveat [inaudible] on the lime disease. Tim, over to you? Tim Urban: If you take the opposite of that answer, imagine your 16 hour awake is like an amorphous wad of self-loathing. Someone asked me the other day like what do you need with your work? And I was like I need a gnome that will follow me around and shock me if I\u2019m not working when I\u2019m supposed to be working. And they were kind of like \u2013 but yeah. No, this is what you\u2019re awesome at and what I admire you for and I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Well, you can also, just to be clear, have really regimented, well-structured self-loathing, just to make that clear. Tim Urban: But I was trying to memorize that answer because I think, for me, the times when I am being productive, I find that two pages a day thing resonates for me because, for me, it\u2019s like if I get \u2013 my problem, when I\u2019m not being productive, is that I have this in my head. I\u2019m behind on my stuff, so, I need to work 14 hours. I need 14 hours of writing today. And I have done those crazy hours when there\u2019s like a crazy panic in my life. So, I know I can. So, I think I can but without the panic, it never happens. And then, six hours into the day, I\u2019ve already blown it. I\u2019ve already blown the day, and you get discouraged. And then, you start the self-fulfilling prophecy yourself that I\u2019m going to blow it. I blew it the last three days. And then, so, if I do the same thing, if I say I\u2019m going to write three hours today, and then, I\u2019ve had a successful day, it\u2019s amazing all of the positive like reward pathway feedback that comes in from feeling like you succeeded that day. And then, that night, you go to bed on time because I already succeeded today, as opposed to thinking, no, I can\u2019t go to bed now. I can\u2019t let this be the whole day. And that can feed on itself. And it\u2019s something I try to remind myself is someone who is three hours of writing five days a week, but really focused. Like phone is away. Deep, deep focus writing 15 hours a week like shocking how much you can produce. Add those weeks together, 40 weeks later, you have a book. The difference between the prolific writer and the self loathing person who doesn\u2019t write anything is one does 15 hours a week out of their 112 waking hours a week, and the other one does 0 out of 112 waking hours. So one-seventh versus zero sevenths. Six-sevenths of those two people\u2019s days and lives are the same. People who can\u2019t put something together, they have this daunting kind of assumption that the prolific writer is fundamentally different. They\u2019re just working constantly all of the time. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way, but it\u2019s the consistency. It is the IBM thing. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve never thought about it that way. That\u2019s a really great way to put it. It\u2019s so true, too. Most writers I know spend the majority of their time inventing things to do to avoid writing. They\u2019re like but my plant is dying. There\u2019s really no way that I could possibly \u2013 Tim Urban: Winston needs another massage. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is an unconstructive environment. The writing is not going to be high quality, if I don\u2019t polish my tennis shoes, and so on. Very, very true. This will be the last question, and then, we\u2019ll move on to the next phase of this evening. What experiments, questions, hypotheses are you wrestling with right now? How have they changed over your life? Where do you think they\u2019ll take you? Now, we may not have a chance to hit every aspect of this. But let\u2019s start with what experiments, questions, hypotheses. Let\u2019s start with you, Tim. Tim Urban: Shit. It\u2019s so nice having his answer \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What experiments, questions, or hypotheses are you wrestling with right now? And then, I\u2019m just going to abridge this and go to where do you think they might take you? Tim Urban: Well, it\u2019s a little like my last answer. I\u2019m trying to sort of \u2013 my mind is structured, as I explained in the Ted talk you mentioned, with there\u2019s three characters. There\u2019s the rational decision maker who is like you should be at work right now. It\u2019s 10:00 a.m. on a Wednesday. Very good time to work. Then, there\u2019s his pet, the instant gratification monkey who has a different idea. He has a different idea of what 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday is good for. And the two of them go back and forth. And the instant gratification monkey wins every single time, which leaves me in what I call the dark playground where I\u2019m not working, but I\u2019m supposed to be. And the only thing that breaks that cycle is the third character who suddenly wakes up when a deadline gets close or there\u2019s some external pressure. That\u2019s the panic monster. And the panic monster freaks the monkey out. The only thing the monkey is scared of. He runs away, and I can get my thing done. And I\u2019m going to die at 45. And what I\u2019m trying to learn how to do, especially since I\u2019m about to start my first book next year, so, like you\u2019ve done 52 books. I need to learn from this man. A book is too big a project. You can\u2019t just do that all at once. It\u2019s like, at some point, you have to learn how to have this internal motivation. And, for me, I\u2019m like a caricature of myself. But there are a lot of people in this room who maybe aren\u2019t classic procrastinators. But, without realizing it, if there\u2019s no kind of deadline, even if they\u2019re not down to the wire with the deadline, the deadline itself just being there is what makes them do stuff. And that\u2019s dangerous because, actually, a lot of what\u2019s really important in life is that kind of important but not urgent stuff, the stuff that doesn\u2019t have a deadline. Seeing your friends and family enough, changing careers, improving yourself in the long run. So, I think this whole \u2013 these three characters things applies to a lot of people. It applies very much to me. So, what I\u2019m working on is trying to just really, really working on having productive days with nothing in the external world making me because a child is not good at that. And I\u2019m trying to be less of a child. That\u2019s my goal of the next year. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I empathize. Tim Urban: Do you? Tim Ferriss: I do. I do. I do. Tim Urban: The most productive person in the history of \u2013 Tim Ferriss: No. I\u2019m just really good at showing the \u2013 when I get tired, this is going to get me in all sorts of trouble, after spending like a year only speaking Japanese, when I get really tired, I start to mix up my R\u2019s and my L\u2019s. I\u2019m not shitting you. Wow. Tim Urban: Do you speak Japanese? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Tim Urban: That\u2019s so cool. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s a cool language. So, and just so you guys know, I\u2019m just going to digress for a second, in Japanese they have [Japanese], they have a syllabary. And the R, L, and D sounds are kind of combined into one thing. That\u2019s why they\u2019re not aware of the distinction. They kind of got screwed when God was handing out phonemes. They didn\u2019t get a lot of sounds. It\u2019s really hard for them to learn other languages. A bit of a rip off for them. But I\u2019m showing the highlight reel of like a very mediocre movie. So, it creates the illusion that I\u2019m just knocking out productivity all day. Not the case, which is why when people are like can we follow you around for a day, I\u2019m like no, absolutely not. Because you\u2019re just going to be like aren\u2019t you going to do something. No, man. I found some lint in the carpet, and I need to fix this. Not a good Dances With Wolves experience for the documentary film goer. So, what experiences, questions, hypotheses am I wresting with right now? I\u2019m going to make this maybe a little soft around the edges, which is not my style, typically. It\u2019s like hard, analytical, quantitative. But whatever. So, I\u2019ve spent the vast majority of my life, at best, tolerating myself. It\u2019s true. I had some really horrible experiences early on that led me to just decide self love was for other people. I could be a really good instrument for competition though. I could hone myself into an instrument with a high pain tolerance to be really good at certain things. And that was enough. And then, I could get my joy or happiness wherever I found that from observing other people. Long story to unpack that fully. But suffice to say, I accepted a really low level of self regard and was really, really unforgivingly brutal with myself. I talked to myself endlessly every day, we\u2019re talking about decades, in a way that I would never speak to another person. And what I\u2019ve realized in the last few months, actually, in particular is that if you want to fully love other people and to make other people feel loved, you can\u2019t get away with just tolerating yourself. You cannot. And you have to learn how to forgive yourself for a lot. But more so than that, for me at least, is to have compassion for earlier versions of yourself that you might view as cowardly or ashamed or weak. And I was introduced to that through something relatively new from me, which is called metta or loving kindness meditation, which sounds super woo-woo. And I mean, the 20-year-old version of Tim would just be vomiting on his shoes right now hearing this. Like oh, my God really. You\u2019re embarrassing us. Stop it. But it\u2019s been a really profound shift in my perspective. And realizing that even if my only goal is not necessarily to love myself but to do the greatest good I could possibly do with my small amount of time on this planet that I have to put my own oxygen mask on first. And that\u2019s something that comes up a lot in Tribe of Mentors, Arianna Huffington, Sharon Salisbury. It comes up again and again. And I just want everybody to realizes this is part of my \u2013 this was a new mission, of sorts, is for people to realize that, if you\u2019re feeling damaged or flawed, and that leads you to be depressed and to have a really, really low amount of regard for yourself where you\u2019re really aggressively brutal to yourself that the first thing to realize is that you are not alone in feeling that. And, in fact, certainly not everyone in this book, but I would wager, and this is just speculation, in most cases, but a very, very high percentage have incredible demons and are fighting battles that we all know nothing about. But really, with some very, very dark periods. So, A) is that you\u2019re not alone, and B) is that you can actually let go of and repair almost all, if not all, of what you think you should just lock away and forget. So, that, I suppose, would be what I\u2019m wrestling with right now and working on and trying to communicate. And there\u2019s some really concrete ways you can go about it. I would recommend everybody, certainly, if any of that resonates, do yourself a favor, get a book called Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach. Terrible title, fantastic book. Give it a read. It could have a huge impact. Unknown Speaker: Have psychedelics helped you at all with that? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. That\u2019s a question about psychedelics. I would say that yes is my tentative answer. But I would not recommend that anyone touch psychedelics without professional supervision. There are legal ramifications to consider. And I would take it as seriously you would choosing a neurosurgeon to remove a tumor that, if misoperated on, would result in a fatality. Because a lot of people right now \u2013 sorry, man. That\u2019s about it. Right now, a lot of people are going on Craig\u2019s List and finding neurosurgeons. My friend is a shaman. We just ordered some stuff from the internet from China from [inaudible]. We\u2019re going to do it in our slow cooker. Bad idea. Bad, bad, bad, bad idea. So, there are many tools. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only tool. Meditation, silent retreats, which I\u2019m not ready to recommend because I do think they can be extremely destabilizing. There are many, many tools in the tool kit. But the point I want to make is there are tools. And you can start with something that does not involve visiting your ancestors and seeing flashing neon crocodiles in your mind, which could be radical acceptance. So, take a look. Thank you guys very much, and thank Tim for being here.

22 to 31 hating myself a little bit because i was burning to do something creative, whether it was writing or music or something", "and i always was doing them on the side", "it was like that kind of just leap of faith in my own kind of ability to do something creative full time took me nine years", "nine years that i wasn\u2019t very happy", "and so, i finally said i have to do something full time because i always thought, if i could just do something full time, put all of the energy from all of these things into one thing, it would go well", "so, i decided \u2013 i actually owned a business with my friend, andrew finn", "and it was the fact that the business got into a decent enough spot that we were able to start something new", "and that\u2019s when i jumped on that", "what was the business", "it\u2019s a test prep company", "this is a great business", "so, [inaudible] who is a very successful novelist also go this beginnings in that \u2013 a good starter business is

procrastinating from my music career is actually all i was doing when i started it because i was tutoring on the side", "and then, of course, the side things ended up taking all of my time, which is

of years ago", "we started a podcast back in 2011 with the theory that podcasts were just going to get bigger, and they did", "unfortunately, we didn\u2019t know how to build a good app", "we built a bad app", "you shouldn\u2019t build a bad app", "\u00a0but now, it was a couple of years later, and it was time for something new", "and i said i\u2019m going to jump on this", "i need to do something creative", "let me see if i can do it as also a business that we can kind of own together", "you can run our tutoring company", "i\u2019m going to go and start something", "and it was between writing a musical, which is a terrible business", "i wouldn\u2019t want to drag him into that", "or writing maybe a content website", "a platform, media platform, that can be a business", "so, that\u2019s why we settled on that", "i knew those were things i could do creatively well", "and so, we settled on this", "and the premise was what if i took instead of five hours a week to write a blog, sixty hours a week to write a blog", "what would happen", "and i took the things i knew that i\u2019d gotten good at on the other blog, which was just kind of writing colloquially and drawing stick figures", "and i started it from there", "what is the origin of the name", "sixteen hours on go daddy searching for dot coms", "and man, there is not much", "but i knew i didn\u2019t \u2013 i wanted it to be something that wouldn\u2019t pigeonhole it into \u2013 all right", "were you just typing in random combinations of words", "or was there some itch you had related to the expression", "did you have a habit \u2013 i was imagining, oh, it\u2019s because people would say something to you, and you\u2019d want to test the assumptions, or you wouldn\u2019t accept it at face value, so, you\u2019d go wait, but why", "that was in my head how i explained it", "i wish it was that situation", "i checked 2,000 things in go daddy, 150 came out", "my girlfriend knocked out 140 immediately", "it was like absolutely not", "that leaves me with 10 where i was kind of like, okay, these are all bad", "which is the least bad", "if the site is good, it can seem kind of cool suddenly, maybe", "but it starts off bad, but then, it\u2019s not bad", "and some of the other ones were just extremely embarrassing", "wait", "you can\u2019t dangle that hook in front of me", "were there any that \u2013 i can give some examples, too, if it makes you feel any better of book titles that are horrible", "but were there any that you really liked that your girlfriend shot down", "you were like we could both do this embarrassing thing, but actually just you", "i\u2019ll kick it off", "so, there was for what ended up being the four hour work week, there was lifestyle hustling", "glad i didn\u2019t use that",

save you from yourself", "those are kind of good", "those at least are sensical", "they have some kind of \u2013 i understand two of those three at least", "all right", "i\u2019ll take two out of three", "that\u2019s partially because i\u2019m giving you the better of the worst", "but your turn", "miniatureking.com", "i was in a deep go daddy spiral", "if you\u2019ve ever been on one of these, it gets weird", "it gets really weird", "so, i\u2019m there, and i\u2019m into this idea of a king because i pictured the playing card king", "and i\u2019m like miniature king, and i suddenly got obsessed with it", "he has little legs, and he\u2019s very angry", "he\u2019s very cranky", "and there\u2019s like big, adult people walking by him, and he\u2019s on the ground", "and he\u2019s like 2 feet tall", "and my girlfriend was like, jesus, absolutely not", "but i got so addicted to the king concept that when i started wait but why, i made the logo a playing card king, and he\u2019s pissed off", "that\u2019s amazing", "you were like okay, kind of", "yeah", "i still kind of think miniature king could have worked", "he\u2019s the mascot", "he\u2019s cranky", "i like it", "but since then, what you can do, this happens all of the time \u2013 do you still own miniatureking.com", "i own miniatureking.com and about 15 others, yeah", "there\u2019s a lot", "i have jesus half bro", "i was going to do a site where i\u2019m jesus\u2019s half brother, but he\u2019s not like the divine one", "he\u2019s just born from jesus\u2019s mom with some guy", "and he\u2019s upset", "what could go wrong with that", "he\u2019s got all kinds of psychological issues going on", "he\u2019s trying to figure out his career", "what were, if you look back because i look back, and i remember my first attempts at blogging at like the first 12 posts", "and they\u2019ve, thankfully, mostly been forgotten over time", "but what were your first \u2013 you had more practice than i did", "you\u2019d already put in 300 reps", "what were the first posts like", "do you remember any of the topics", "so, with my early blog, the topics were like they started with three sentence things", "the first three were the title was frankly, and then, it said if peeing in the shower is wrong, i don\u2019t want to be right", "that was a blog post back in the day", "flash forward six years now, wait but why, i knew more", "and i knew right away it was going to be like long and thorough because it was my own site, and i knew i could get into depth, if i could just go longer", "so, at the beginning, i was anonymous, and i\u2019m sure you dealt with this, too", "at some point, it\u2019s the get attention phase", "so, anonymous, the only marketing platform i had was my personal facebook page", "and i started with seven ways to be insufferable on facebook, which sounds like a buzz feed headline, but it was much more in depth", "it got into the deep, dark psychology of why it\u2019s the wild west of social etiquette, and why we\u2019re all a very embarrassing version of ourselves on it, and what the different negative human qualities that come through on it", "that was the very first one", "i actually went to easter island for a month before i started wait but why, to just alone in the middle of nowhere write blog posts and pick my favorite one to put on first to just kind of figure out what i \u2013 and that was the winner", "why did you pick easter island", "i like the fact that you could take a 2,000 mile yardstick and swing it around the island and not hit any people", "that was cool to me", "it was so isolated", "plus, the statues and the whole thing", "and i was kind of like i\u2019ve always wanted to go", "it was either there, or i was going to go to lithuania in the winter and just creep out some small village", "you can tell me a small village to creep out some time", "and i actually talked to someone, and they were like you may actually arouse suspicion if you\u2019re this foreigner working every day in the caf\u00e9", "i\u2019m just writing blog posts in isolation in a small, lithuanian village", "yeah", "it sounds like a george clooney spy movie", "but i do want to do that, in the mid dead of winter, go to a small, cold village somewhere", "so, how did the blog post do, that one", "it did well", "the very first one, i chose well", "how did you choose it relative to the other ideas that you had", "trying to do some combo of something that i thought was true enough to me that represented the kind of quality i wanted to do but also that could go viral", "just beginning, how could it go viral because that\u2019s the \u2013 what year was this", "do you know", "in 2013, summer of 2013", "so, that post did really well", "it got 500,000 uniques in the first month", "wow, that\u2019s an incredible number", "my whole last blog got 250,000 uniques in 6 years", "so, this was like okay, longer", "getting into more serious topics and insulting people", "it\u2019s on to something", "plus, what i didn\u2019t know, at the time, was that 2013 was a pretty magical year to be promoting content on facebook", "this was that \u2013 facebook had decided let\u2019s show everyone just how powerful we are", "this is why buzz feed exploded", "upworthy, you first heard of it in 2013, viral nova, these sites exploded because facebook\u2019s algorithm, basically, said anyone posting content, we\u2019re going to show it to half a million people", "i was in the right place at the right time, so, that was very helpful as well", "just to maybe underscore one thing, for instance, when i started my first business, it was the golden age of google ad words", "it was shooting fish in a barrel, so in expensive", "and then, when the four hour work week launched, it was at the same time at south by southwest when twitter was effectively publicly debuted", "there were big screens displaying all of the tweets in the world going on, which happened to be concentrated right in austin, texas because it was so small", "and i would say that any time is the right time, in some way", "so, these opportunities we\u2019re talking about, there are these opportunities right now", "you just have to try to sniff them out, or just shoot in the dark and hope that you\u2019ll catch some tail wind", "but everybody has, it seems with these stories, some element of luck involved", "but you can improve the odds", "that\u2019s just \u2013 right", "there\u2019s like 10 waves throughout your \u2013 and one of the waves is cresting when you\u2019re starting", "you don\u2019t know which one", "but something is cresting at the time", "and it\u2019s the perfect time to start something for some reason always", "right", "and in every story where you find a component of good timing, there\u2019s usually a component of bad timing, right", "like podcast app", "you were paddling for the right wave, you were just doing it years too early", "yeah", "all right", "so, i want to bring another figure, another character into this picture", "who is winston", "can you tell us about winston, please", "winston is a close friend of mine", "i met him in 2005 when he was 3 months old", "i purchased him", "and we lived happily together ever since", "he was the size of a golf ball, at the time", "now, he\u2019s the size of a football, which is a huge upgrade for him", "he\u2019s a tortoise", "but he\u2019s very loveable", "he\u2019s kind of my apartment screen saver", "i\u2019m just sitting in what would be a still scene, and there\u2019s this moseying thing", "this little, moseying dinosaur that moseys by", "and who doesn\u2019t want that", "you should all own a tortoise", "it\u2019s weird that most of you don\u2019t own a tortoise", "why did you name him winston", "because i thought he had a churchill look to him", "or it\u2019s more that churchill has a tortoise look to him", "i\u2019m sort of imagining, and i know they\u2019re not the same, but the sea turtles in finding nemo", "and it\u2019s like, yeah, i can see that", "maybe a \u2013 yeah, but winston has less charisma", "but otherwise, yeah", "when i look at some of your posts, and i\u2019ve had my life very directly and profoundly impacted by some of your writing, particularly about time remaining with say parents or family", "but when i look at some of your very research heavy posts, and it feels funny to call them posts, whether it\u2019s on ai or other topics that confuse a lot of people", "we\u2019re talking about, for those of you who don\u2019t have any familiarity, in some cases, 50,000 words, 70,000 words", "that\u2019s a book, everybody", "how long is the four hour work week", "four hour work week, that\u2019s a solid, now, it\u2019s deceptive to use page count, but that\u2019s how i think, it\u2019s about i want to say 420 pages or 430 pages", "and it\u2019s not gigantic dr", "seuss print", "so, it\u2019s probably closer, if i\u2019m guessing, taking a stab, to the 100,000 or 120,000 word mark", "i seem to have sort of word inflation with the books i write", "they\u2019re getting bigger", "but when you\u2019re tackling one of these post, what are some of the approaches or questions you ask that allow you to write something better and different", "because, presumably, many people are out there trying to learn about these various topics", "and yet, you put out these posts that are the size of books that end up going viral", "and you make complicated or seemingly complicated topics, very digestible", "so, what is your approach to tackling a topic like ai", "yeah", "so, it\u2019s pretty simple for me", "first of all, i do this kind of weird thing where i assume that my audience is i picture like a stadium full of me", "so, it\u2019s narcistic fantasy", "no, but it\u2019s just \u2013 i\u2019m just writing for \u2013 i\u2019m writing the exact post that i would be thrilled to get", "so, i\u2019m just \u2013 that\u2019s my focus group right there, right in my head", "and it\u2019s easy because we\u2019re all kind of special, unique people, except not really", "there\u2019s like 100,000 copies of each of you out there somewhere", "and the truth is, if i just write for me, there are a lot of people that have my exact weird taste", "i just know that", "so, i start there with kind of like who am i writing for", "that makes it easy", "and so, with something like ai, if there\u2019s a one through ten scale of how much you know about something, ten is world leading expert, and one has absolutely never heard of the term, i started at two or three on most stuff like most layman", "i\u2019m a layman about everything", "and so, then, i spend \u2013 just my curiosity is the driver", "i pick topics i\u2019m excited to dig into", "and i\u2019ll spend however long it takes", "sometimes, it\u2019s one day", "sometimes, it\u2019s three weeks", "sometimes, it\u2019s three months", "but i\u2019ll take as long as i need to to learn enough to get me to maybe like a five or a six out of ten", "i\u2019m not going to get a phd", "i\u2019m not going to spend five years getting myself to an eight or nine", "but i\u2019m going to get myself to a six where i\u2019m like i can answer, basically, any question a layman asks me", "i can do a q&a with an audience on this topic for 10 hours, and i\u2019ll have a pretty good, solid answer to everything", "not that i know, necessarily, the truth of everything", "but i know when the experts don\u2019t know the truth, and they\u2019re arguing", "i know what the experts say about, basically, everything", "so, i get myself to that level", "and then, i think about so, experts have sometimes a hard time explaining because they haven\u2019t been at a two in decades sometimes", "and they have this jargon", "and they don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to be a two out of ten", "i was there three weeks ago", "i know exactly what my readers know about this", "and i know exactly what \u2013 so, i just looked at the road i went down to get myself to a six", "and i think about how could i do that road way more efficiently, if i could go do it again now", "how could i do it in a much more fun way", "and what\u2019s a fun story i could tell to bring readers from the two to a six", "and so, that\u2019s my challenge then is to, basically, package the road i just went down for three weeks and make it an hour and a half package instead", "okay", "not surprisingly, i have some follow up questions", "let\u2019s pick a subject", "have you written about crypto currency or blockchain", "not yet", "oh, perfect highly requested topic", "i\u2019m sure it is", "the reason i ask is that much like ai, i have seen dozens of people attempt to explain, without misrepresenting, crypto currency and blockchain 101 for the masses", "and it seems like almost every single attempt has failed", "if you were to take that assignment on, where would you start", "so, i always start, i feel like, i\u2019m blindfolded in a room", "and i\u2019m just trying to figure out where are even the walls here", "where is the furniture", "i just want to start and understand what i even need to learn", "so, i want to get a picture of the topic", "and then, i can start diving in, going down various rabbit holes", "and, usually, going outside of the topic", "a rabbit hole outside of the topic is procrastination", "but it also, often, gives you even more context", "you\u2019ll find some metaphor out there that you end up bringing back", "so, i\u2019ll just read and read and watch you tube videos all on the internet", "how do you search", "reading, do you start at wikipedia", "is that ground zero", "yeah", "i\u2019ll start at wikipedia for just a basic foundation", "wikipedia is good at telling you where the walls are", "just letting you even understand the topic, in general", "and letting you even understand the topic, in general", "and wikipedia has a lot of good knowledge on it", "so, i\u2019ll go there, and then, i\u2019ll go to the bottom of wikipedia and start clicking on the reference links", "and i\u2019ll usually google blockchain pdf, and you end up finding all of these superbly boring journal articles", "and then, i\u2019ll go on you tube", "there are a lot of good people, smart teachers explaining stuff on you tube", "they\u2019re not going to explain the whole thing, usually", "they\u2019re going to explain one part", "maybe i realized that, to understand blockchain, you need to first go down three layers", "you need to build a foundation that begins with understanding what encryption is", "you need to understand how encryption works and public keys and private keys", "that\u2019s when you can start to, on top of that, build an understanding of what a ledger is that would be on these different computers and how it could possibly be secure", "and by the time you get to blockchain, you\u2019re like eight layers up", "so, i\u2019ll go find a you tube video not on blockchain, but on encryption", "and then, i\u2019ll find a you tube video explaining what ledgers are, in general", "i was reading about the history of ledgers and where they\u2019re used it the world, and encryption and how it was invented and how its evolved", "and you just keep doing this", "and the reason it\u2019s easy for me, this part, is because i\u2019m super curious", "so, the more i learn, the less icky the topic gets", "when the topic gets un-icky, it starts to be super delicious, the opposite of icky", "and then, i can\u2019t read enough", "and it\u2019s so fun suddenly", "i\u2019m like i get it", "and then, i just want to fill in the knowledge, and i want to watch a you tube video i already know the answer to just to feel good about i already knew everything he\u2019s saying", "this is great", "but it solidifies it", "and you hear seven different people articulate it in seven ways", "and it just rounds out your understanding", "and by the end, i start to be like i totally get this", "i find a video on you tube", "so, last i checked, which was not recently, you tube was the second largest search engine in the world", "there\u2019s a lot of great stuff", "there\u2019s also a lot of nonsense", "how do you search", "so, what are the terms", "how do you sort them", "how do you go about picking properly", "well, so, in google, i will google blockchain", "leave that in a window", "open a new window, and i\u2019ll google bitcoin", "new window, ethereum", "new window, crypto currency", "new window, decentralized systems crypto", "new window, crypto currency is bullshit", "new window, whatever", "and i\u2019ll just keep going", "and i\u2019ll just think of anything", "and then, each one of those windows i go back to, and i just hold down command, and i just click, click, click, click, click, click, and i have 10 tabs, 10 tabs, 10 tabs", "and i just go and read everything", "so, google, again, i don\u2019t have to discern", "i don\u2019t care if this [inaudible] article is going to be really useful or whether it\u2019s going to be accurate because the beginning process is just if you read 70 articles that may or may not have validity to them, the total sum of them actually you start to understand what do we know as a species", "where are we all agreeing", "and then, where, clearly, a lot of people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about", "or there\u2019s this broad, this kind of dichotomy of a view in this one area", "and there\u2019s these people, and there\u2019s these people", "you tube is kind of the same thing", "i\u2019ll just start watching without discerning", "again, if you\u2019re a procrastinator, it\u2019s fantastic because you don\u2019t feel bad about just watching endlessly when it\u2019s taking all of your time, and it\u2019s not what you\u2019re supposed to do, and it feels great", "so, i\u2019ll just watch", "and then, of course, the sidebar starts to figure out \u2013 you tube very quickly, and google, will figure out what you\u2019re doing", "and then, you tube will start to put all of the things on the side for me", "plus, you start to see names you trust", "make money in crypto currency in one week", "well, it\u2019s funny, i\u2019m just writing a post now on like, we won\u2019t get into this, but like political stuff", "and normally, my sidebar is like look how much of an idiot trump is and his voters", "and then, i\u2019m now trying to \u2013 i was googling all of these conservative things because i\u2019m writing about both sides of stuff", "and suddenly, the internet starts to indoctrinate me the other way", "and they\u2019re like look at this wise trump voter embarrass this \u2013 and i look over, and i\u2019m kind of like \u2013 and a couple of hours later, i\u2019m like trump is the best", "so, you tube figures out your angle, and it will start to kind of feed you stuff", "and then, there\u2019s certain names you trust", "hank and john green", "i trust them", "[inaudible], i trust them", "cgp gray, i trust him", "so, you\u2019ll see certain names you trust", "minute physics, great", "so, there\u2019s also that, and the same with google, of course", "i\u2019ll trust certain sources more than others", "and once you\u2019ve ingested massive amounts of information, and you\u2019ve established a basic map for the territory, what do you think are the tools or approaches, anything at all, that help you to be so good at teaching these subjects in the way that you present it or structure your pieces", "well, so, again, the starting point is i just went through this", "and i teach myself", "and i was bad at teaching myself because i didn\u2019t know what i was doing", "so, now, the experience of a learner is fresh in my head", "so, that\u2019s the first thing that\u2019s helpful", "but then, i always, basically, with almost any explainer post like that, i just zoom out", "helicopter up", "if you\u2019re looking at the land, and you see kind of like a beach, you don\u2019t know what it is", "is this a huge lake", "is this a little beach", "does it curve around", "i don\u2019t know", "that\u2019s how i feel a lot of the articles on ai or crypto currency are", "and then, the author might have a full understanding, but they\u2019re just describing the beach", "so, you take a helicopter up, and you\u2019re like okay, wait a second", "this is a big river", "and there\u2019s a \u2013 and you go up further, and you\u2019re like oh, no, this is kind of a tributary that goes into the ocean", "and now, you\u2019re kind of up where airplanes go and maybe even the international space station goes, and you\u2019re like okay, this is actually what\u2019s going on", "so, i start there myself as a thinker and then, when i\u2019m trying to explain, i\u2019m just going to start there, which is why people make fun of me because i\u2019ll write about three different things", "and they all start at the big bang by the time i\u2019m done with them", "i have to, basically, go back", "but, sometimes, it\u2019s helpful", "by the time you get from the big bang to now, suddenly, we can see the whole coastline, and now, the beach suddenly makes sense", "and i try to make it fun also because who wants to like \u2013 so many \u2013 the journal articles, the experts, they\u2019re not writing to entertain", "and it\u2019s just bad", "it\u2019s like textbooks and school where it\u2019s so bad", "they were so boring", "part of the reason i like you tube is because people who end up with a lot of views on you tube that are going to end up on my recommended thing, they have an eye for entertainment", "so, i try to do the same thing as well", "and if you were to ask say friends of yours who are fans of your writing what your ingredients for entertaining are, what might they say", "or to just ask you", "i don\u2019t want you to be overly self deprecating", "i\u2019m just trying to figure out what makes it entertaining", "because it is, clearly, entertaining", "again, entertaining means 10 different things to 10 different people", "every post, i get nine emails from mothers in kansas angry at me for swearing", "but it depends on it\u2019s, i think, trying to add sense of humor into basically everything", "treating it light, good metaphors", "for me, lots of visuals", "i\u2019m a visual learner", "if i see a block of text, and i\u2019m just scrolling down, i\u2019m kind of upset", "it feels like homework", "but if i scroll down, and every few paragraphs, there\u2019s a chart, there\u2019s a comic, i\u2019m suddenly like okay, this is fun", "i\u2019m kind of excited", "and so, that\u2019s how i think", "so, i try to do that", "that\u2019s what i would want", "so, there\u2019s so many things where you can just do a funny stick drawing or really good diagram", "and it\u2019s just way clearer and sticks in your head more", "if i\u2019m going to talk about procrastination, i can talk about the limbic system and talk about how it works and our flight or fight zone", "or i can make an instant gratification monkey because that is, essentially, what it is", "and that\u2019s more memorable and i think more fun to read, at the time", "so, you\u2019ve really, in my opinion, exhibited a mastery for taking what many people would consider extremely intimidating subjects, many of them involved in forging what we\u2019re going to experience as a species as the future", "so, i\u2019d like to talk about the future for a second", "and i want to read a quote here", "i believe that you wrote or said this, so correct me if i\u2019m wrong", "\u201ci always thought the future would be intense", "but now, i think the future is going fully fucking crazy.\u201d okay", "so, what are a few things that you\u2019re excited about or see coming down the pike in the future", "it doesn\u2019t have to be one or two", "it could be many", "it is going to be crazy, and here\u2019s why", "so, the first thought a lot of people have is that it\u2019s na\u00efve to think that the future is going to \u2013 we\u2019re at the end of times", "everyone thinks that", "you\u2019re just another na\u00efve person that thinks they live in a special time", "and the reason we all have that instinct is because we\u2019re \u2013 biology moves very slowly", "it evolves very, very slowly", "so, 50,000 years is nothing in biology and evolution", "so, we\u2019ve barely changed", "meaning, we\u2019re still a baby born today is a baby that is perfectly optimized to live in a tribe in ethiopia in 50,000 bc", "and everything about it is ready for survival in that world", "but what we\u2019ve done is taken that baby away from its home planet and brought it to another planet, which is the earth in 2017", "and that baby isn\u2019t made very well for this world", "none of us are", "so, the first thing to think about is just that a lot of our instincts and a lot of our intuitions are actually going to be inherently wrong", "we\u2019re going to be living in a delusion that was helpful back then and today just is not great", "so, the reason \u2013 the way you can cut through tis and actually see reality when that baby is not \u2013 seeing reality isn\u2019t helpful to that baby", "fitting in with the tribe is and believing what the tribe believes is", "so, today, we want to see reality", "so, you can just look at the facts sometimes", "so, imagine that \u2013 this is going to be a long answer", "imagine that \u2013 i have a lot to say about this", "imagine that the \u2013 this is what i\u2019m saying about the zoom out", "answers can\u2019t be short in my head", "so, imagine that human history is about 1,000 centuries \u2013 get comfortable, folks", "settle in", "so, 1,000 centuries of human history, 100,000 years", "so, each two centuries is a page in a book", "how many pages is this", "about 700 pages", "so, 500 pages", "actually, whatever", "they\u2019re finding older, human mermaids, so, fine", "so, 140,000 years, every page in this book that you\u2019re holding is 200 years in human history", "so, page 1 through 650 of that book, hunter gathers", "if you\u2019re an alien reading this book to understand what happened on this planet, you are bored", "this is really boring", "page 650, 10,000 years ago, you have the agriculture revolution", "wait", "so, suddenly, people are coming together and forming cities", "they\u2019re starting to actually form larger civilizations", "they have a collective intelligence that\u2019s starting to form", "they can compare notes", "they can kind of create the knowledge tower that is bigger than any one of them", "it\u2019s very interesting stuff", "so, that\u2019s 50 pages ago", "then, it gets boring again for a while", "page 690 out of 700, the little tiny end of the book here, you\u2019ve have jesus", "you have 693, you have the advent of islam", "the roman empire happens two pages ago", "it\u2019s already done", "in 697, you have imperialism", "for the first time, you have countries", "there\u2019s this new thing that happened in the last three pages", "page 698, you have the enlightenment, you have the renaissance", "you have things like this", "they discover that there\u2019s galaxies, telescope", "page 699, you finally get to the beginning of the us and the beginning of the constitutional democracies", "now, page 700 happens, which is from about 200 years ago to today", "so, the beginning of page 700, the alien turns the page, industrial revolution happens", "big deal, big change", "and as he reads down the page, things start to go crazy", "you start to have \u2013 in 699 pages this alien has read, this boring ass species has communicated through letters and talking", "he was excited about language 500 pages ago", "now, he\u2019s bored", "smoke signals, firing a canon ball in the air, stuff like that", "suddenly, on page 700, we go to the space station", "we have the moon", "we have airplanes", "we have cars just on page 700", "so, 699 pages, we only communicate through \u2013 we have this kind of simple transportation, communication", "now, we have face time", "we have telephone", "we have the internet", "crazy", "less than a billion people for the first 699 pages", "on page 700 alone, we cross the one, two, three, four, five, six and seven billion person marks", "so, the alien is reading", "and his wife comes in and is like hey, we\u2019re going to have dinner", "and he\u2019s like shut up", "this is the most riveting thing suddenly", "he\u2019s like what is about to happen to this species", "this is crazy what just happened on this page", "this is when we\u2019re born", "we\u2019re born at the end of page 700", "this is why when someone says what do you think the future is going to be, i\u2019m like page 701", "and he\u2019s like what the hell is this guy talking about", "page 701, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not going to be nuts", "this shit just goes bonkers", "yeah", "the first three sentences of page 701 will take us to 2025 when they predict that ai is going to, basically, infiltrate every single industry and part of our lives the way electricity did in a 10 year span in the 1880\u2019s", "that\u2019s the first three sentences", "so, to me, i see revolutions", "the first half of page 701, the first quarter of page 701, i see revolutions in vr, ar", "i see revolutions in ai", "i see revolutions in brain machine interfaces", "we\u2019re going to be able to think thoughts to each other", "it\u2019s way cooler for language, for the first time", "i see revolutions in genetic stuff", "your grandkids are going to be like, so, you just had a baby and hoped it was a good baby", "it\u2019s going to seem crazy", "it\u2019s going to seem so primitive", "and you can just go on and on and on with things", "how about this one", "what are the major leaps for life", "you can count on one hand for all of life", "simple cell to complex cell, big one", "complex cell to multi cell, big one", "we have animals now", "ocean to land, big one", "i would say the fourth that fits on this same list is going from one planet to multi planets as a civilization", "that\u2019s happening in the next decade with space", "no one is talking about it yet, but they will be", "just the fact that we\u2019re going to witness, in our lifetimes, one of the great leaps for all of life", "this isn\u2019t normal", "okay", "so, i want to talk about extra planetary, just a couple of curious notions that i\u2019ve been bouncing around in my own head", "if you had to bet on more humans inhabiting mars or inhabiting space stations that don\u2019t have to conquer a separate gravity, where would you bet", "because there are competing camps, or at least technologists who are looking at say inhabiting other planets, or saying no, that makes no sense because now, you\u2019re dealing with a separate environment, gravitational field, etc", "we\u2019re going to just build space stations", "i would say mars, for a while", "mars is probably going to have a million people in the next five or six decades", "and then, it will, eventually, probably end up at a billion people", "but i think space stations, in the long run, way better", "it\u2019s going to seem really crappy to be on a planet", "being on a planet is going to seem very old school and very kind of rough compared to the space stations we can \u2013 imagine dealing with weather", "it\u2019s going to seem crazy that you\u2019d have to deal with weather, that you had to deal with things like climate change", "it\u2019s just not our problem", "we have to deal with bugs", "i\u2019d be so happy that there\u2019s no bugs on the space station", "so, i think, in the long run, that", "but i have a more important question, which is are you going to go to mars", "no", "no", "well, not in the near term", "i don\u2019t want to be the first monkey shot to mars", "i\u2019ll let quite a few people work out the kinks on that one", "we can\u2019t even figure out how to upgrade ios without replacing i with fucking images", "i\u2019m going to let someone shoot me to mars", "no, not early, no", "okay", "now, picture it\u2019s 20 years from now, and every 26 months, earth laps mars, and they end up next to each other", "that\u2019s when you have this window to go", "so, every 26 months, there\u2019s going to be a colonial fleet heading there and another fleet coming back, bringing people back, round trip tickets", "all though different people on the legs, right", "exactly", "and there\u2019s going to be first class things", "there will be like fancy people", "but everyone will be jumping around, bouncing around with the gravity", "it sounds great like a zero gravity cruise ship", "so, the question is, for you, it\u2019s 2038", "or 2045, and it\u2019s been proven, for the last 20 trips back and forth, no one has gotten hurt", "it\u2019s totally safe", "would i visit", "yeah", "what\u2019s the total time invested, at this point, in the transportation", "let\u2019s say the shortest round trip you can do is a 52 month", "i would strongly consider it", "i heard jeff bezos say recently on stage, before you think about going to mars, spend a month in antarctica", "that\u2019s a cake walk", "oh, antarctica is way better than mars", "antarctica but 15 to 20 degrees colder", "you can\u2019t breathe the air", "and you can\u2019t be outside in the sun without a radiation suit", "so, i think it depends a lot on the brochure of mars club med that i receive", "yeah, it\u2019s not good", "all right", "shifting gears a little bit, ai, do you think it is an existential threat or not", "and if so, what is the time horizon for it becoming an imminent existential threat", "so, this is one of the great questions", "ai is probably the subject i\u2019ve talked to most experts on", "so, i\u2019m not an expert, but i really know what the experts think", "and i try to keep up to date because they change their minds a lot", "no, we\u2019ll be fine", "no, we\u2019ll be fine now that we\u2019re all dead", "what i find is very few people who don\u2019t think this is going to basically take over everything", "the question is when", "and i was surprised that even the people that are pessimistic, they kind of think it might be 100 years from now", "most people think 50, 30, and people that deep mine these days at google, which is like the leading ai company now, they\u2019re saying things like 10", "and when i say 10, 10 until what", "i\u2019m talking about before any of this moment happens \u2013 to understand ai, you have to think about two things", "there\u2019s narrow intelligence, and there\u2019s general intelligence", "\u00a0so, humans have general intelligence", "we\u2019re smart across the board", "we have social skills", "we have creativity", "we can understand math", "we can read", "we can be creative", "we can learn from experience", "you just name anything, and humans can kind of learn how to be smart there", "but when you think about ai, ai is way better than any human at the things it\u2019s good at like chess, the world chess master", "and it\u2019s the world master at everything that it does well", "but it\u2019s only good at that one thing", "so, there\u2019s ai on your phone", "there\u2019s ai in your car", "there\u2019s ai running most stuff, at this point, but it\u2019s only good at one thing", "so, the question is when will ai gain that same breadth that we have", "when will it become broadly smart", "and until then, it\u2019s still going to change the world", "it\u2019s still going to take a huge amount of jobs and create a whole bunch more", "so, it\u2019s going to be a massive group of changes that happen even before we get general intelligence", "but the question that i was referring to before is when do we get to this level where ai is not smart like we are but way, way smarter, what nick bostrom calls super intelligence where it\u2019s as smarter than us as we are than monkeys", "yeah", "so, basically, if you picture like not only can a monkey not build this room, or when you look out in the night sky, and you see little lights moving around, humans are so smart", "we put those there", "we put airplanes and satellites in the night sky", "so, not only can a monkey not do that, you can show the monkey the lights of this building, and he can\u2019t even understand that you did it", "he just will think that it\u2019s just there", "that\u2019s just a moving star", "so, we\u2019re talking about something that not only can we not do what this thing can do, we can\u2019t even understand that it did it, even if it tried to explain it", "that\u2019s how smart this thing is", "it\u2019s really crazy concept", "so, things that we think are hard like curing disease, poverty, climate change, anything we consider a challenge, easy, piece of cake for the ai", "so, that\u2019s the really exciting side", "and then, there\u2019s what if we\u2019re not in control of it the way we want to be, not that it\u2019s going to be evil", "that\u2019s this anthropomorphization that people do", "they try to apply human stuff to this thing that\u2019s not human", "but when you build a house, and there\u2019s an ant hill there, you\u2019re not like death to the ants", "you just built a house, and they were in the way, so you killed them", "big deal", "the fear is that the ai is doing its thing and that we\u2019re kind of in the way", "and we programmed it in a way that we didn\u2019t think of this thing", "but now, it\u2019s too powerful", "we can\u2019t change it", "and we\u2019re toast", "or it gets annoyed that we\u2019re doing something to it that it doesn\u2019t want, and we\u2019re toast", "so, you have some high stakes here, which is why, basically, we\u2019re going to have god on earth because we can play god to every other animal right now, even a chimp", "chimps are really smart, until we put it in a cage", "now, what are you going to do", "we have a gun", "we have a taser", "we can poison its food", "chimps are nothing compared to our god-like ability because we have a little intelligence gap over them", "little in the scheme of things", "when this thing has a big intelligence gap over us", "it truly can play god to us", "it truly can play god to us", "so, the question is is it a good god that can solve all of our problems", "or is it one of those dick gods in the old testament like that guy", "so, this is what they\u2019re talking about", "this is why ai safety is so important", "but most of the money and time is going into ai development right now so, last questions, and then, we\u2019ll go to audience questions", "how do you view happiness, just to bring it back to things that we may be able to influence, at least speaking for myself and a lot of people in this room", "how do you view or define happiness for yourself, if you do at all", "i kind of think of there\u2019s two kinds of happiness that you have to kind of deal with both", "one is micro happiness like are your tuesdays good", "are you generally having a good tuesday", "and then, there\u2019s like macro happiness", "are you present", "are you like yeah, i\u2019ll dig into this current life for 20 years", "i love it", "or are you like i was, for nine years after college, which is like i\u2019m doing this now, but i really want to like \u2013 i should be doing \u2013 and that\u2019s macro happiness", "so, i think you have to worry about both", "i think that the most important one to get right, at the beginning at least, is macro", "i think if your macro happiness isn\u2019t there, you\u2019re going to feel frustrated", "you\u2019re going to have a cloud over you", "and then, i think you can work on micro happiness, which is about lifestyle", "this is what your so good at", "and i think a lot of people here really both kind of happinesses, they look to you because you have a lot of good advice", "but i think with micro, you focus so hard on just really crushing a tuesday", "and i think but all life is is literally a tuesday again and again, and then, you die", "so, crushing the tuesday is \u2013 that\u2019s the title of my next book", "let\u2019s get good at it", "white sand and tuesdays", "so, yeah, but the thing that\u2019s hard is a lot of times, we assume that it\u2019s the external world", "we have to succeed", "we have to get this relationship, and then, we\u2019ll be \u2013 this is kind of clich\u00e9, but we know that it\u2019s messing with your internal expectations", "it\u2019s getting your mind in the right place and kind of seeing reality, and seeing what is your ego, and what is your fear, and what is worrying about judgment, and what is actually real that matters to you, and realizing that a lot of the perceived risk isn\u2019t really dangerous, and a lot of the perceived reward isn\u2019t really gratifying", "and it\u2019s all there in front of you, if you can just look past your primate self with your very rational, intelligent self and just see it, and then, learn to internalize it", "often, suddenly, the happinesses become very clear how to work themselves out", "and it\u2019s \u2013 often, we end up spending all of our time trying to get to those happinesses with the primate kind of self in charge", "and that usually doesn\u2019t get us there", "so, to add to that, reality minus expectations", "is that a useful framework for defining happiness, do you think", "yeah", "so, you say your happiness is like an equation, reality minus expectations is your happiness", "and so, you can work on two things", "you can work on improving your reality, or you can work on not lowering but kind of refining your expectations to reflect what actually matters to you, which will almost always end up with them lowering, in a certain sense, and maybe going up in another sense", "but the classic trap, of course, is you\u2019re in a way better place than you were 10 years ago, but you\u2019re just as unhappy because your hedonic treadmill concept is this term that psychologists use that your happiness goes up because something really good happens", "even the little examples", "you buy something new, and you wake up in the morning like my iphone x10 or whatever, and you\u2019re all happy", "and every day, that goes down", "and six days later, it\u2019s just your stupid iphone again", "but we use this in a macro sense", "you get the new job", "you finally get into a really good relationship", "you work it out, or you have a sick friend or a parent, and then, they get healthy", "and wow", "so, the way to get off the treadmill is obvious", "just obsess over gratitude", "what i have, what i want", "and looking up, you\u2019re going to be really unhappy", "and the mountain keeps growing underneath you, but you\u2019re not even looking at it", "you\u2019re just looking up all of the time", "it\u2019s going to seem like everything sucks", "if you\u2019re looking down, you\u2019re like look at this mountain", "it\u2019s amazing", "look at all of the things i have", "you\u2019re going to be really happy", "so, the gratitude things are really", "all of the things you\u2019re supposed to write the three good things that happened that day", "every night before you go to bed, write three good things that happened and why they happened", "the reason why psychologists say this is good is because it trains your brain to all day be thinking what\u2019s good, and i have to do this thing tonight", "what\u2019s good", "and suddenly, you\u2019re looking down at all of these things that are good in your life as opposed to looking up at what sucks", "what sucks about this situation", "how is the world wronging me, which is a pure recipe for unhappiness", "okay", "i\u2019m going to try to put a little icing on top just to add to that, which is i was reading recently about some of the supposedly objectively assessed happiest places on earth", "and if you look at them, three of them are costa rica [spanish]", "okay", "i\u2019m screwing up my gender already", "at least i did it in spanish", "so, moving on, i\u2019m going to move on quickly", "costa rica, singapore, any singaporeans here that want to shout", "okay", "i\u2019m all for it", "you don\u2019t see it as much in singapore", "and then, denmark", "all right", "you can write a letter", "i love norway", "but i will rely on national geographic", "you can write them an angry letter", "they are very communicative", "so, norway also", "but i can only speak to the danes, but i will give you the official gold medal", "but the silver medal for the danes", "and i want to point out a couple of things knowing people in all three places that, in singapore, there\u2019s very much an optimization for improving your reality", "and it\u2019s very sort of achievement focused", "and there\u2019s a large economic component", "nonetheless, the various combination of factors lead them to be in the very top", "on the opposite side of that equation, or at least on the alternate side, you have the danes", "and i know a lot of danes", "and i remember, at one point, without even bringing up any of this, i said you guys are, apparently, really happy", "why do you think that is", "and as a group, they said we have really low expectations", "i was like wow", "that\u2019s interesting", "let me noodle on that", "and then, i think costa rica is kind of squarely in the middle in a lot of respects", "so, stuff to ponder", "work on both", "and also, it just struck me that given all of the talk about stoicism and so on that i tend to beat people over the head with, stoicism, in a lot of respects, i would view as a complete philosophical system that checks a lot of boxes but does focus quite a bit on refining your expectations and preparing for the worst case scenario", "so, i often add quite a healthy dose of epicureanism and so on, which is more on the opposite side", "in any case, tim, thank you so much", "and we\u2019re going to jump into some audience questions", "please give a hand", "and we will definitely be doing some individual hellos", "but let me jump in and see what we have here", "and i suspect there might be some curve balls/bear traps that i don\u2019t want to step into", "so, let me see what we have here", "bear with", "all right", "you\u2019re 20, you have 3 to 6 months pre-job/post college", "i take that to mean three to six months after graduation to do whatever, no financial social commitments, and you\u2019ve already read tim\u2019s books", "thank you for that", "how do you spend your time to maximize wellbeing and develop perspective", "aman from paris", "wellbeing and develop perspective, three to six months", "now, you may have already done this", "where is aman", "is aman here", "hey, how\u2019s it going", "so, you may have already done this", "so, if i were giving advice to the normal american audience for that, i would say travel for those three to six months, go to countries where you do not speak the language", "get deliberately lost in places that are safe perhaps like japan or costa rica in most places", "and for wellbeing and developing perspective, wellbeing would mean deliberately exposing yourself to people who are worse off, maybe at least financially, than yourself", "so, spending part of that time volunteering, for instance, in those three to six months", "and then, that will simultaneously help you to develop many, many different perspectives", "that would be just speaking as someone whose life was changed completely by a number of overseas experiences, which i had starting at age 16 or 17", "i had never really spent time outside of the us", "that would be my recommendation", "tim, do you have any other thoughts", "i think that\u2019s right in line with what i would have said, which is, basically, traveling, to me, is another way to zoom out because you\u2019re just looking at your life from far away", "it\u2019s like you\u2019re not going there to look at your life, but you end up thinking about your life", "and, for some reason, being far away, being out of your comfort zone and out of your element, you just have fresh eyes on your whole situation", "you can have this perspective", "it\u2019s like going in a helicopter and looking at it from up there", "and a lot of things make sense", "and then, i would also say couple that with kind of like a hard zoom in on reality, which i think you get from \u2013 i might have said wait tables, work construction", "just do something where you\u2019re just around working people", "and it just reminds you what work is like, what reality is like, what adults go through", "and then, that can help you figure out where you\u2019re about to be and what you want to do", "for sure", "and the travel advice i would not limit to someone just getting out of college", "i think everybody, when possible, should have that experience because the benefits outlast the trip because what will happen to most people, especially if you put yourself in very foreign environments where perhaps you can\u2019t even read what is written, japan, china, many different examples, whether it\u2019s cyrillic, arabic, doesn\u2019t matter", "and you observe different customs", "what happened, to me at least, in japan, for instance, which was my first real time abroad for a year as an exchange student", "the only person who looks like this in a school uniform in a high school of 5,000 japanese kids", "pretty easy where\u2019s waldo game", "but i was like they drive on the other side of the street", "that doesn\u2019t make any sense", "then, i was like wait a second, maybe we don\u2019t make any sense", "they take a shower before they get into the bath tub", "that doesn\u2019t make any \u2013 wait a second", "it makes perfect sense", "and i got back, and i realized how many rules we follow are just made up", "they\u2019re just totally made up", "very fragile, socially reinforced illusions that we just reinforce", "and that\u2019s very liberating because you realize wait a minute, if all of these different cultures do thing differently, maybe i don\u2019t have to go there to do things differently", "i can do that here", "then, you start to really question assumptions", "and you become, in my experience, more experimental", "let\u2019s go to another question", "what trends, industries, topics are you most excited about right now", "patrick", "patrick, is patrick here", "hey, patrick", "all right", "i like that hi tim applies to both of us", "it simplifies matters", "what\u2019s trends, industries, topics am i most excited about right now", "speaking for myself, trends, i\u2019m not watching very closely", "i have trouble explaining why", "i suppose i\u2019m not trying to capitalize on any trends because i feel like, particularly having left silicon valley and having moved to austin, which i love on almost every level, if i am spotting trends that i hope to capitalize on, by the time you see it, you\u2019re too late, generally speaking", "so, i\u2019m not paying a lot of attention to trends", "industries, i am interested just almost from an academic standpoint, in space travel, not so much from a personal experiential standpoint", "but, specifically, looking at inhabiting planets versus building space stations", "that debate is interesting to me because you have some of the smartest humans of the last 50 or 100 years, arguably, with very, very different viewpoints", "and whenever that happens in any field, i\u2019m really interested", "you see that in quite a few places", "topics, i would say, and this might be considered a trend, i\u2019m hoping to turn it into a trend, which would be scientific research using current cutting edge technologies to re-examine both psychedelics and mdma, which i wouldn\u2019t strictly consider, in the traditional sense, a psychedelic for applications to very debilitating, serious conditions ranging from ptsd to treatment resistant depression, end of life anxiety, and so forth", "so, i\u2019ve taken most of my energy and capital that went into startups and redirecting that to scientific research at johns hopkins, hopefully other places like ucsf, nyu also that are taking these compounds that have been used very, very wisely, i think, in certain contexts for millennia by various civilizations and applying a scientific lens to understand the mechanisms of action and the risks involved, quite frankly", "but how they can be less politicized and stigmatized for unscientific reasons and examined so that we have a better understanding of why they do what they do, which can be pretty incredible", "what about you", "trends, industries, topics that you\u2019re excited about right now", "definitely, some of those", "i agree with you on getting the stigma off of perspective altering drugs", "but i would also add there\u2019s a lot of cool things going on in the field that also has a stigma called life extension", "and the stigma is it just seems like it\u2019s just narcistic, rich, white guys that want to live forever", "but the truth is, and people think it\u2019s vain and this narcistic kind of thing", "but really, you could just reframe it as, if you just cure or learn how to manage four things that kill people, basically, which is like heart disease, stroke, alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, it just means that \u2013 and other things going on in health like we can just live a lot longer, and higher quality later years, who doesn\u2019t want that", "it\u2019s this knee jerk reaction that makes people not even want to put money or time into this industry", "but i just feel like there were definitely people back when humans lived on an average to 40, it would have been like death at 40 is the lot of man", "living to 80 \u2013 like now, we\u2019re all happy about that", "no one wants to go back", "if suddenly 140 was the new 90, and 90 was the new 50, who is not happy about that", "so, and we always say because, at that point, you\u2019re done", "well, that\u2019s only because we got used to that", "we\u2019re managing our own expectations", "if we all died at 35, i would be like, well, it\u2019s been good", "but i\u2019m not like that", "i\u2019m all ambitious and excited because i think i have more decades", "so, i think that there\u2019s a lot going on", "mark zuckerberg and his wife are one of the teams that are trying to cure all diseases by the end of the century", "this is just a machine", "and the diseases are just a glitch inside the machine", "if we can have enough nano tech and really fancy ai, medicine and everything, we can go in there and fix it", "this is a fantastic development", "the most heart breaking thing is someone that you love died especially early", "let\u2019s work on that", "so, i think there\u2019s a lot going on there", "but i think that a lot more would be going on, if the stigma of this as kind of like a narcistic pursuit would just go away", "yeah", "to comment on one thing there, in terms of the narcistic rich people, everyone should want the narcistic millionaires and billionaires to spend as much money as possible on this", "you want them to be the people who create the economies of scale for everybody else", "and many of the things we take for granted now like recycling started off being very hoity-toity, affluent experiments", "and you want them to be spending millions of dollars on something that, in 10 years, is going to be available for $50.00 at cvs", "plumbing, like sanitation, these things were all rich people things for a while", "and then, everyone benefits tremendously from them", "people also get mad", "they think this is just going to benefit the rich", "it\u2019s this unfair thing where super rich people will be able to live longer", "it\u2019s like yeah, for a while", "and then, it trickles to everybody because the cost comes down as we get better, so, get over it", "on that note, moving on", "if you want to read some i think very interesting thinking related to what might account to life extension, or at least death prevention, dr", "peter attia is one to pay attention to, one of my favorite people", "what is the name of the city everyone must visit before they die", "thanks for everything, steve correll, not to be confused with steve carrell the ca \u2013 it\u2019s a great name spelled differently", "on my list, i would have to go with tokyo because it has such an unusual combination of safety, cleanliness, extreme weirdness, and incomprehensibility, even to someone who speaks japanese that it provides a really unique \u2013 i think i just used that twice, and i\u2019m going to get shit from friends who love to heckle me for using modifiers on unique", "they\u2019re like, no, there\u2019s no such thing as very unique", "okay", "i\u2019m going to say it again just to annoy them", "it\u2019s a very unique opportunity to feel extreme discomfort and confusion with elation with next to no real harmful consequences", "so, i think that provides an awesome learning opportunity and just a fun trip", "so, i would say tokyo is very high on the list", "you stole my answer again", "i was just in japan all summer", "and it\u2019s like going to another planet", "and you\u2019re like how does this civilization live", "and you\u2019re on another planet", "that\u2019s how different it is", "and just isolated", "western culture has infiltrated so many places, and it just hasn\u2019t really there", "and they just have done everything their own way", "and so, you\u2019re like how does the cab door open", "oh, it opens by itself", "then, they get in, and it closes by itself", "that\u2019s really cool", "so, to give a different answer, i\u2019ll say hanoi, vietnam just because crossing the street is just crazy", "so, there\u2019s like bikes, motor bikes, just a sea of them going by", "and there\u2019s no stop lights", "and it doesn\u2019t stop", "and what you do as a walker is you just walk", "it\u2019s like indiana jones walking over the thing", "you just walk, and you just \u2013 and they figure it out", "and it\u2019s unbelievable", "it\u2019s like you feel like you\u2019re god walking on water or something weird", "you just walk out, and nothing happens", "but the thing you don\u2019t want to do is be a freaked out tourist that stops because then you\u2019re doing something they can\u2019t anticipate", "but you\u2019ve got to try this", "steady, well-paced strides, confident", "yes", "[inaudible] is it the same there", "i didn\u2019t go down there", "[inaudible]", "you spent some time in ho chi minh", "[inaudible]", "go with the flow, or else you die", "good advice", "my goodness", "that one would take us both several hours knowing the two of us", "i apologize to the person\u2019s whose name i will not read", "all right", "dear tim, that applies to both of us, regarding two crappy pages per day, i\u2019ll explain what that means, how do you structure your days and weeks when you are working on a book", "thanks, jeane or jeanie, i\u2019m not sure of the e", "jeanie: either way is fine", "i\u2019ll go with both", "i wasn\u2019t sure how to respond", "so, the two crappy pages per day, for those who don\u2019t know, was advice that i received regarding writing and working on a book, which can be, in my personal experience, a very daunting, intimidating task", "and i would get frozen for days or weeks", "and i\u2019d try to write something, and it wouldn\u2019t be perfect", "and i\u2019d throw it out", "and a mentor of mine, or an author i knew, said your quota should be two crappy pages per day", "and he told me the story about ibm and how they demolished the competition by exceeding every sales quota every quarter", "and just absolutely steamrolling everyone for a long time", "and he asked me do you know why that is, and i said no", "and he said because the quotas were low", "and then, people were unintimidated to pick up the phone to make the calls", "and you can do the same thing with yourself with writing", "and you do that by making your bar for successful day two crappy pages", "that\u2019s it", "even if you throw them both out and you never use them, you\u2019ve won the day if you have two crappy pages", "and, of course, over time, there are days when you just get your two crappy pages", "and they are really, truly terrible", "then, there are other days where you overshoot", "you\u2019re in the flow, and you get 10, 15, 20 pages", "you don\u2019t need so many of those to eventually put together what can become a book", "in terms of structuring my days and so on, i\u2019ll be super, super specific here because the weeks and months, basically, look identical", "and it\u2019s just copy and paste of this particular day", "i realized for myself that i benefit greatly given historical predisposition to bipolar and all of these various things", "that\u2019s just written in my code", "it\u2019s a whole other story", "but it\u2019s kind of laughable how i\u2019m predisposed my family is that writing your sunshine is really important", "so, i write books, generally, during summer months", "and my day involves getting up, not super early, but for me, respectably early, which would be say 9:00 a.m", "or 9:30", "before the sun is setting", "and i wake up, i meditate for 20 to 22 minutes, which would be, typically, transcendental meditation or some type of guided meditation", "then, i jump in the water because i\u2019m on long island", "i jump in the water to wake up", "i might do a little bit of swimming", "i hop out", "i already have pages from the night before that i want to edit", "i will edit during the day, but i do my pros generation at night", "that\u2019s just when i have the best output", "but i can edit, do that grunt work during the day", "i have printed out pages", "i will go into a sauna, which requires all sorts of trickery because you start sweating on the pages", "but go into a sauna, and i will hand edit those pages", "then, i come out, take a quick shower", "i have a very small breakfast of some type, typically, macadamia nuts and some eggs", "very, very small", "and i continue to work, very often, at a treadmill desk", "and the treadmill desk works during this period of time at a very slow pace because, say in the case of tribe of mentors, i\u2019m handing outreach and editing", "i\u2019m not going to do original drafts and composition at the treadmill desk", "i will work at the treadmill desk, this is literally the exact day", "and this won\u2019t take hours to explain", "then, around say noon or 1:00 p.m., hop on a bike with a researcher or someone that i have hired to be with me in the same house at all times", "why is this important", "i realized that writing is very isolating for me", "and it can catalyze a lot of negative mental states and downward spirals because i feel alone", "so, i have someone physically there, even though we could probably do the work remotely", "they have to be optimistic, which, fortunately, my researcher is", "everything to him is hand clapping, amazing", "really good influence to have around", "so, we both get on a bike", "so, you\u2019ll notice there are little bursts of physical exercise inserted in the day", "get on bikes", "ride to this very mediocre deli, and we have mediterranean wraps every day", "for those interested, it is whole wheat tortilla with chicken, humus, tomato, avocado added, always extra cost", "and we eat our mediterranean wraps, and i have unsweetened ice tea plus sparkling water", "and we will work there until say 5:00 or 6:00, the sun starts to set", "jump on the bikes, sometimes head to the bay, jump in the water again, head home", "and then, have a snack, work for an additional two to three hours, then, go to dinner", "there are two or three restaurants that we go to, that\u2019s it", "those are the rotations", "and for all of these restaurants, i\u2019ll give a pro tip, jesus, what a long answer that i said wasn\u2019t going to be long, all right", "pro tip for people who might want to do this", "now, it\u2019s late", "we\u2019re going out late", "we\u2019re having dinner at 9:00", "a lot of these kitchens close at say 9:30, 10:00", "what does that mean", "staff is going to be fucking pissed that we\u2019re coming in right as the door is about to close", "and i know this because i worked in service jobs as bus boy and waiter in restaurants forever", "i get it", "so, here\u2019s what you do", "you have three restaurants", "you know you\u2019re going to be going to them for a few weeks or a few months", "you go to the same restaurant for dinner three nights in a row", "and then, the next restaurant, same place, three nights in a row", "each night, you buy rounds of tequila over and over again for every person who works in the restaurant", "front of house and back of house, really important", "these people will now love you", "and they will let you hang out for an extra hour, hour and a half", "this is really key", "so, we do this", "then, we go home, not too much tequila", "and we\u2019ll continue to prepare things for the next day, go to bed around 1:00 a.m., and then, it\u2019s ground hog day over and over again", "that\u2019s it", "and there are \u2013 very often, i would say every other day, some type of kettle bell swings or exercise that is done immediately before leaving to dinner", "and it\u2019s just that day over and over and over again", "yes, i see a raised hand", "[inaudible]", "oh, yes", "so, important clarifying question, do i work where we have lunch", "yes", "there are outdoor picnic tables, and we will sit down and work outside", "that\u2019s actually a fairly key point", "but you have to have a high tolerance for mosquitoes and tics because it\u2019s eastern long island", "so, caveat [inaudible] on the lime disease", "tim, over to you", "if you take the opposite of that answer, imagine your 16 hour awake is like an amorphous wad of self-loathing", "someone asked me the other day like what do you need with your work", "and i was like i need a gnome that will follow me around and shock me if i\u2019m not working when i\u2019m supposed to be working", "and they were kind of like \u2013 but yeah", "no, this is what you\u2019re awesome at and what i admire you for and i \u2013 well, you can also, just to be clear, have really regimented, well-structured self-loathing, just to make that clear", "but i was trying to memorize that answer because i think, for me, the times when i am being productive, i find that two pages a day thing resonates for me because, for me, it\u2019s like if i get \u2013 my problem, when i\u2019m not being productive, is that i have this in my head", "i\u2019m behind on my stuff, so, i need to work 14 hours", "i need 14 hours of writing today", "and i have done those crazy hours when there\u2019s like a crazy panic in my life", "so, i know i can", "so, i think i can but without the panic, it never happens", "and then, six hours into the day, i\u2019ve already blown it", "i\u2019ve already blown the day, and you get discouraged", "and then, you start the self-fulfilling prophecy yourself that i\u2019m going to blow it", "i blew it the last three days", "and then, so, if i do the same thing, if i say i\u2019m going to write three hours today, and then, i\u2019ve had a successful day, it\u2019s amazing all of the positive like reward pathway feedback that comes in from feeling like you succeeded that day", "and then, that night, you go to bed on time because i already succeeded today, as opposed to thinking, no, i can\u2019t go to bed now", "i can\u2019t let this be the whole day", "and that can feed on itself", "and it\u2019s something i try to remind myself is someone who is three hours of writing five days a week, but really focused", "like phone is away", "deep, deep focus writing 15 hours a week like shocking how much you can produce", "add those weeks together, 40 weeks later, you have a book", "the difference between the prolific writer and the self loathing person who doesn\u2019t write anything is one does 15 hours a week out of their 112 waking hours a week, and the other one does 0 out of 112 waking hours", "so one-seventh versus zero sevenths", "six-sevenths of those two people\u2019s days and lives are the same", "people who can\u2019t put something together, they have this daunting kind of assumption that the prolific writer is fundamentally different", "they\u2019re just working constantly all of the time", "it doesn\u2019t have to be that way, but it\u2019s the consistency", "it is the ibm thing", "i\u2019ve never thought about it that way", "that\u2019s a really great way to put it", "it\u2019s so true, too", "most writers i know spend the majority of their time inventing things to do to avoid writing", "they\u2019re like but my plant is dying", "there\u2019s really no way that i could possibly \u2013 winston needs another massage", "yeah", "this is an unconstructive environment", "the writing is not going to be high quality, if i don\u2019t polish my tennis shoes, and so on", "very, very true", "this will be the last question, and then, we\u2019ll move on to the next phase of this evening", "what experiments, questions, hypotheses are you wrestling with right now", "how have they changed over your life", "where do you think they\u2019ll take you", "now, we may not have a chance to hit every aspect of this", "but let\u2019s start with what experiments, questions, hypotheses", "let\u2019s start with you, tim", "shit", "it\u2019s so nice having his answer \u2013 what experiments, questions, or hypotheses are you wrestling with right now", "and then, i\u2019m just going to abridge this and go to where do you think they might take you", "well, it\u2019s a little like my last answer", "i\u2019m trying to sort of \u2013 my mind is structured, as i explained in the ted talk you mentioned, with there\u2019s three characters", "there\u2019s the rational decision maker who is like you should be at work right now", "it\u2019s 10:00 a.m", "on a wednesday", "very good time to work", "then, there\u2019s his pet, the instant gratification monkey who has a different idea", "he has a different idea of what 10:00 a.m", "on wednesday is good for", "and the two of them go back and forth", "and the instant gratification monkey wins every single time, which leaves me in what i call the dark playground where i\u2019m not working, but i\u2019m supposed to be", "and the only thing that breaks that cycle is the third character who suddenly wakes up when a deadline gets close or there\u2019s some external pressure", "that\u2019s the panic monster", "and the panic monster freaks the monkey out", "the only thing the monkey is scared of", "he runs away, and i can get my thing done", "and i\u2019m going to die at 45", "and what i\u2019m trying to learn how to do, especially since i\u2019m about to start my first book next year, so, like you\u2019ve done 52 books", "i need to learn from this man", "a book is too big a project", "you can\u2019t just do that all at once", "it\u2019s like, at some point, you have to learn how to have this internal motivation", "and, for me, i\u2019m like a caricature of myself", "but there are a lot of people in this room who maybe aren\u2019t classic procrastinators", "but, without realizing it, if there\u2019s no kind of deadline, even if they\u2019re not down to the wire with the deadline, the deadline itself just being there is what makes them do stuff", "and that\u2019s dangerous because, actually, a lot of what\u2019s really important in life is that kind of important but not urgent stuff, the stuff that doesn\u2019t have a deadline", "seeing your friends and family enough, changing careers, improving yourself in the long run", "so, i think this whole \u2013 these three characters things applies to a lot of people", "it applies very much to me", "so, what i\u2019m working on is trying to just really, really working on having productive days with nothing in the external world making me because a child is not good at that", "and i\u2019m trying to be less of a child", "that\u2019s my goal of the next year", "yeah", "i empathize", "do you", "i do", "i do", "i do", "the most productive person in the history of \u2013 no", "i\u2019m just really good at showing the \u2013 when i get tired, this is going to get me in all sorts of trouble, after spending like a year only speaking japanese, when i get really tired, i start to mix up my r\u2019s and my l\u2019s", "i\u2019m not shitting you", "wow", "do you speak japanese", "yeah", "that\u2019s so cool", "yeah, it\u2019s a cool language", "so, and just so you guys know, i\u2019m just going to digress for a second, in japanese they have [japanese], they have a syllabary", "and the r, l, and d sounds are kind of combined into one thing", "that\u2019s why they\u2019re not aware of the distinction", "they kind of got screwed when god was handing out phonemes", "they didn\u2019t get a lot of sounds", "it\u2019s really hard for them to learn other languages", "a bit of a rip off for them", "but i\u2019m showing the highlight reel of like a very mediocre movie", "so, it creates the illusion that i\u2019m just knocking out productivity all day", "not the case, which is why when people are like can we follow you around for a day, i\u2019m like no, absolutely not", "because you\u2019re just going to be like aren\u2019t you going to do something", "no, man", "i found some lint in the carpet, and i need to fix this", "not a good dances with wolves experience for the documentary film goer", "so, what experiences, questions, hypotheses am i wresting with right now", "i\u2019m going to make this maybe a little soft around the edges, which is not my style, typically", "it\u2019s like hard, analytical, quantitative", "but whatever", "so, i\u2019ve spent the vast majority of my life, at best, tolerating myself", "it\u2019s true", "i had some really horrible experiences early on that led me to just decide self love was for other people", "i could be a really good instrument for competition though", "i could hone myself into an instrument with a high pain tolerance to be really good at certain things", "and that was enough", "and then, i could get my joy or happiness wherever i found that from observing other people", "long story to unpack that fully", "but suffice to say, i accepted a really low level of self regard and was really, really unforgivingly brutal with myself", "i talked to myself endlessly every day, we\u2019re talking about decades, in a way that i would never speak to another person", "and what i\u2019ve realized in the last few months, actually, in particular is that if you want to fully love other people and to make other people feel loved, you can\u2019t get away with just tolerating yourself", "you cannot", "and you have to learn how to forgive yourself for a lot", "but more so than that, for me at least, is to have compassion for earlier versions of yourself that you might view as cowardly or ashamed or weak", "and i was introduced to that through something relatively new from me, which is called metta or loving kindness meditation, which sounds super woo-woo", "and i mean, the 20-year-old version of tim would just be vomiting on his shoes right now hearing this", "like oh, my god really", "you\u2019re embarrassing us", "stop it", "but it\u2019s been a really profound shift in my perspective", "and realizing that even if my only goal is not necessarily to love myself but to do the greatest good i could possibly do with my small amount of time on this planet that i have to put my own oxygen mask on first", "and that\u2019s something that comes up a lot in tribe of mentors, arianna huffington, sharon salisbury", "it comes up again and again", "and i just want everybody to realizes this is part of my \u2013 this was a new mission, of sorts, is for people to realize that, if you\u2019re feeling damaged or flawed, and that leads you to be depressed and to have a really, really low amount of regard for yourself where you\u2019re really aggressively brutal to yourself that the first thing to realize is that you are not alone in feeling that", "and, in fact, certainly not everyone in this book, but i would wager, and this is just speculation, in most cases, but a very, very high percentage have incredible demons and are fighting battles that we all know nothing about", "but really, with some very, very dark periods", "so, a) is that you\u2019re not alone, and b) is that you can actually let go of and repair almost all, if not all, of what you think you should just lock away and forget", "so, that, i suppose, would be what i\u2019m wrestling with right now and working on and trying to communicate", "and there\u2019s some really concrete ways you can go about it", "i would recommend everybody, certainly, if any of that resonates, do yourself a favor, get a book called radical acceptance by tara brach", "terrible title, fantastic book", "give it a read", "it could have a huge impact", "have psychedelics helped you at all with that", "yeah", "that\u2019s a question about psychedelics", "i would say that yes is my tentative answer", "but i would not recommend that anyone touch psychedelics without professional supervision", "there are legal ramifications to consider", "and i would take it as seriously you would choosing a neurosurgeon to remove a tumor that, if misoperated on, would result in a fatality", "because a lot of people right now \u2013 sorry, man", "that\u2019s about it", "right now, a lot of people are going on craig\u2019s list and finding neurosurgeons", "my friend is a shaman", "we just ordered some stuff from the internet from china from [inaudible]", "we\u2019re going to do it in our slow cooker", "bad idea", "bad, bad, bad, bad idea", "so, there are many tools", "i don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only tool", "meditation, silent retreats, which i\u2019m not ready to recommend because i do think they can be extremely destabilizing", "there are many, many tools in the tool kit", "but the point i want to make is there are tools", "and you can start with something that does not involve visiting your ancestors and seeing flashing neon crocodiles in your mind, which could be radical acceptance", "so, take a look", "thank you guys very much, and thank tim for being here"]}
