This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is typically my responsibility to distill expertise or, I should say, rather, habits, tactics, tools, etc. from world-class performers. Those things that you can test in your own life, apply to your own life. Whether they are from the world\u2019s say entertainment, sports, military, or in this case, chess, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Tai Chi push hands. But this episode is going to be an experimental episode. I want share a few things that are adapted from my new book \u2013 Tools of Titans. You can find it on BarnesandNoble.com, Amazon.com, everybody. They should be available. It\u2019s also a highlight reel, in effect, that you guys \u2013 many of you, thousands of you \u2013 have asked me for. We\u2019re going to invite back one of my favorite people on the planet, Josh Waitzkin. He\u2019s an endlessly fascinating guy. Josh Waitzkin \u2013 you can find him at joshwaitzkin.com \u2013 was the basis for the book and the movie, Searching for Bobby Fischer. He was considered a chess prodigy, but he has perfected learning strategies that be applied to anything by anyone. I really mean that. Including his loves of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (he\u2019s a black belt under \u2013 I think he was the first black belt under phenom Marcelo Garcia; we\u2019ll talk more about him) and Tai Chi push hands, in which he was a world champion. These days, he spends his time very quietly coaching the world\u2019s top athletes and investors, working to revolutionize education (we\u2019ve partnered on a number of things there) and tackling his new passion of paddle surfing (in the latter, very often nearly killing me in the process). I first met Josh after reading his book \u2013 The Art of Learning. As I think I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve become very dear friends. Male Speaker: Empty Space. Tim Ferriss: Josh has no social media, does no interviews \u2013 except for my podcast, for which he very often says to me or texts me, \u201cYou fuck!\u201d After all, he\u2019s from New York City. He avoids nearly all meetings and phone calls. He is perhaps the best I\u2019ve met (actually, there\u2019s one other \u2013 Rick Rubin, who\u2019s been on the podcast as well \u2013 legendary music producer). He minimizes input to maximize output. As Josh would say, \u201cI cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.\u201d So you might ask yourself how are you creating empty space? How are you creating the slack necessary to connect dots that perhaps you haven\u2019t connected before or come up with original ideas? Josh is an expert here. Josh Waitzkin: I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process. Male Speaker: Learning the macro from the micro. Tim Ferriss: Josh really focuses on depth over breadth in everything. He often uses a principle nicknamed, \u201clearning the macro from the micro.\u201d This means focusing on something very small in a field, whether that\u2019s in chess, martial arts or elsewhere, to internalize extremely powerful macro principles that apply everywhere. I\u2019ll give you a few examples. This is also sometimes combined with beginning with the end game. I will illustrate that. For instance, when Josh gave me a beginner\u2019s tutorial on chess, he didn\u2019t start with opening moves. Memorizing openings is natural, of course, and nearly everyone does it. But Josh likens it to stealing the test answers from a teacher. You\u2019re not learning principles or strategies; you\u2019re merely learning a few tricks that will help you beat your novice friends. Instead, Josh took me in the complete reverse, just as his first teacher, Bruce Pandolfini, did with him. So he took off all of the pieces \u2013 empty board \u2013 and he added three back in an end game scenario, where he would usually finish the game. King and pawn against king. So in this case, through the micro \u2013 positions of vastly reduced complexity \u2013 he was able to force me to focus on the macro. Principles like the power of empty space, opposition or setting an opponent up for zugzwang, which is a situation where any moves he makes will destroy his position. So by limiting me to a few simple pieces, he hoped that I would learn something limitless \u2013 high level concepts that I could apply anytime against anyone. I\u2019ve seen Josh do this himself to many things, including, for instance, Jiu-Jitsu, where he can cover near all the principles of Jiu-Jitsu, the main tenets that will help you compete at a high level, by focusing on a single submission and the end game called, in this case, the guillotine or specifically, the \u201cMarcelotine,\u201d from Marcelo Garcia. After he gave me this tutorial in chess (part of it was recorded and there\u2019s an extended scene that\u2019s available in the TV show I did called \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Experiment), I went to Washington Square Park and lasted about ten times longer than I ever have before competing against these street hustlers. That was literally from practicing no openers, no nothing aside from these high-level principles with three pieces on the board. Pretty cool stuff. Male Speaker: If you\u2019re studying my game, you\u2019re entering my game. Tim Ferriss: Josh and I spent a lot of time discussing and, in some cases, hanging out with or training with Marcelo Garcia. Five time World Champion in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, with whom Josh owns the Marcelo Garcia Academy in New York City, which I highly recommend if you have a chance. They have a very strict, no asshole, no bully policy. It\u2019s probably also the cleanest and certainly one of the most competitive Jiu-Jitsu gyms in the world. Marcelo \u2013 who\u2019s Marcelo? Marcelo is arguably the best grappler of the last hundred years. He\u2019s considered the combined Mike Tyson, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan of his sport. Whereas most competitors are very secretive about their training for competition, their competition prep, Marcelo does the opposite. He routinely records and uploads his exact sparring sessions. In other words, his exact training for major events, which all of his competitors can watch. Josh explains the rationale. Josh Waitzkin: When he was competing in Abu Dhabi\u2019s Submission Grappling World Championship and Mundials, which is the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu World Championship, we were streaming his sparring sessions every night. So he was basically showing his competitors what he was about to use against them in two weeks and three weeks and four weeks. His attitude about this was just completely unique, is if you\u2019re studying my game, you\u2019re entering my game and I\u2019ll be better at it than you. Tim Ferriss: I often share exact, under-the-hood details of how, for instance, I\u2019ve built the podcast or put together Kickstarter campaigns and so on. I do this really for two reasons. They\u2019re reflective of two core beliefs. So let\u2019s talk about those. Belief No. 1: It\u2019s rarely a zero-sum game. In other words, if someone wins, someone else must lose. That\u2019s just not the case. It\u2019s rarely a zero-sum game in something like podcasting. The more that I help people with details, the more details help I receive in turn. Belief No. 2: If it is competitive, I\u2019m simply offering people the details of my game, right? My attention to detail will scare off half of the people right off the bat who would have tried. So now we\u2019re down to 50 percent of the people who have heard it or read it or observed it. 40 percent will try it and be worse than me because it\u2019s my game, right? I\u2019m capitalizing on my strengths with my particular strategies and so on. But 10 percent will try it be better than me. Now, is this a problem or is it not? I would just say: See Belief No. 1. That 10 percent will often reach out to me to teach me exactly what they learned and did to get better results because they are grateful for what I offered in the first place, which was transparency. So call it karma, call it anything you might like. I call it very, very useful and plus, it\u2019s just a more offensive and not defensive way to live and to perform in a professional arena for me. Male Speaker: Remember the last three turns. Josh Waitzkin: I remember when I went skiing with Billy Kidd, who you might recall is one of the great downhill racers back in the \u201860s, the Olympic Ski Team. Awesome dude. Now he skis out in Colorado wearing a cowboy hat. Just a timeless guy, brilliant dude. He was saying to me years ago, when I first skied with him, \u201cJosh, what do you think are the three most important turns of the ski run?\u201d I\u2019ve asked that question to a lot of people since. Most people will say, \u201cThe middle because it\u2019s the hardest, the beginning because they\u2019re getting momentum.\u201d Billy describes the three most important turns of a ski run are the last three before you got in the lift. It\u2019s a very, very subtle point. For those of you who are skiers, you know that\u2019s when the slope is leveled off, there\u2019s less challenge. Most people are very sloppy then. They\u2019re taking the weight off the muscles they\u2019ve been using. They have bad form. The problem with that is that on the lift ride up, unconsciously, you\u2019re internalizing bad body mechanics. As Billy points out, if your last three turns are precise, then what you\u2019re internalizing on the lift ride up is precision. So I carry this on to the guys who I train in the finance world, for example. Ending the work day with very high quality, which opens up \u2013 for one thing, you\u2019re internalizing quality overnight. Tim Ferriss: Thanks to Josh, I now always end training sessions on a good rep, per se. Whether that\u2019s AcroYoga (you can definitely learn more about that by listening to my episode with Jason Nemer), gymnastics (check out Coach Sommer), archery or other. For instance, even if I have 60 minutes budgeted for a workout, if I hit a fantastic PR, in other words, a personal record at say 45 minutes, or do something new particularly well in gymnastics, I pack it in. That\u2019s the end of the workout. In the case of archery, which is a new passion of mine, I always use what\u2019s called blank bale practice. A bale like a hay bale (they would use that you would put a target on and aim for). A blank bale is where I start and end all sessions with five to six arrows shot by feel alone. Eyes closed, into a target that is a mere ten feet away. So I\u2019m not aiming at anything. This is similar in many senses, to dry firing with firearms or handguns, for instance, to try to minimize any type of flinching that you might have in anticipation of the shot. You\u2019re able to then kinesthetically incorporate the fine motor control that will ultimately aid you in other circumstances. One of Josh\u2019s favorite writers, Hemingway, had a practice of ending his writing sessions mid-flow and mid-sentence. This way, he knew exactly where to start the next day and he could reliably both end and start his sessions with confidence. Male Speaker: To turn it on, learn to turn it off and vice versa. Josh Waitzkin: Marcelo Garcia, who we were talking about, one of my most beautiful memories of him and World Championships, right before going into the semi-finals. [Inaudible]. Everyone\u2019s screaming, yelling. He\u2019s sleeping. Sleeping in the bleachers. You\u2019d wake him up. He\u2019d sort of stumble into the ring. You\u2019ve never seen a guy more relaxed before going into a World Championship fight. Then he can turn it off so deeply, and man, when he goes in the ring, you can\u2019t turn it on with any more intensity than he can. His ability to turn it off is directly aligned with how intensely he can turn it on. So training people to do this, have stress and recovery, undulation throughout their day. Male Speaker: The little things are the big things. Josh Waitzkin: We\u2019re talking about Marcelo talking about embodying the principle of quality. In all these little ways \u2013 these little ways you could say don\u2019t matter, but they add up to matter hugely. Tim Ferriss: I think the little things are the big things, right? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because they\u2019re a reflection \u2013 I mean, this might sound clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s like how you do anything is how you do everything. Josh Waitzkin: It\u2019s such a beautiful, incredible principle. Most people think they can wait around for the big moments to turn it on. But if you don\u2019t cultivate turning it on as a way of life in the little moments \u2013 and there\u2019s hundreds more times little moments than big \u2013 then there\u2019s no chance in the big moments. Male Speaker: Just go around for life. Josh Waitzkin: Lateral thinking or thematic thinking \u2013 the ability to take a lesson from one thing and transfer it over \u2013 I think is one of the most important disciplines that any of us can cultivate or ways of being. It\u2019s something that Jack and I have, from a really young age, we began to cultivate this from when he was really small around this principle of \u201cgo around.\u201d The first time it happened, he was really tiny. We were in a little cottage on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a tiny little cottage in a big field. He was trying to get in one door and he couldn\u2019t, but he could get in the other door. I said, \u201cJack, go around.\u201d He looked at me and then he went around. And then \u201cgo around\u201d became a language for us physically. If you can\u2019t go one way, you go around, turn another way. But then it became a language for us in terms of solving puzzles and in terms of anytime you run into an obstacle, go around. Then working with the metaphor of go around opened up this way that we would just have dialogue around connecting things. Taking a principle from one thing and applying it to something else. We\u2019ve had a lot of fun with that. Male Speaker: Embrace your funk. Josh Waitzkin: That\u2019s a term my buddy, Graham, who\u2019s a dear friend of ours who comes on our surf adventures with us. He\u2019s a brilliant thought partner. Tim Ferriss: \u201cEmbrace the funk.\u201d Could you explain that? Josh Waitzkin: Yeah, we have to embrace our funk. We have to figure out what \u2013 you think about the entanglement of genius and madness or brilliance and eccentricity. Understanding that entanglement is always a precursor to working with anybody who\u2019s trying to be world-class at something, because that entanglement is fundamental to their being. They have to ultimately embrace their funk; embrace their eccentricity; embrace what makes them different and then build on it. Male Speaker: Who do you pick when your ego seems threatened? Josh Waitzkin: It\u2019s very interesting to observe who the top competitors pick out when they\u2019re five rounds into the sparring sessions and they\u2019re completely gassed. The ones who are on the steepest growth curve look for the hardest guy there, the one who will beat them up or who might beat them up. While others will look for someone they can take a break on. Male Speaker: The importance of language on a rainy day. Josh Waitzkin: One of the biggest mistakes that I observed in the first year of Jack\u2019s life or year or two of Jack\u2019s life that I observed with parents is that they have this language around weather; weather being good or bad. Whenever it was raining, they\u2019d be like, it\u2019s bad weather. You\u2019d hear moms, babysitters, dads talk about if it\u2019s bad weather, we can\u2019t go out or if it\u2019s good weather, we can go out. So that means that somehow we\u2019re externally reliant on conditions being perfect in order to be able to go out and have a good time. So Jack and I never missed a single storm. Every rain storm. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve missed one storm, other than one maybe when he was sick. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve missed a single storm, rain or snow, going outside and romping in it. We developed this language around how beautiful it was. So now whenever there\u2019s a rainy day, Jack says, \u201cLook, Da-Da. It\u2019s such a beautiful rainy day.\u201d And we go out and we play in it. I wanted him to have this internal locus of control. To not be reliant on external conditions being just so.

jason nemer), gymnastics (check out coach sommer), archery or other", "for instance, even if i have 60 minutes budgeted for a workout, if i hit a fantastic pr, in other words, a personal record at say 45 minutes, or do something new particularly well in gymnastics, i pack it in", "that\u2019s the end of the workout", "in the case of archery, which is a new passion of mine, i always use what\u2019s called blank bale practice", "a bale like a hay bale (they would use that you would put a target on and aim for)", "a blank bale is where i start and end all sessions with five to six arrows shot by feel alone", "eyes closed, into a target that is a mere ten feet away", "so i\u2019m not aiming at anything", "this is similar in many senses, to dry firing with firearms or handguns, for instance, to try to minimize any type of flinching that you might have in anticipation of the shot", "you\u2019re able to then kinesthetically incorporate the fine motor control that will ultimately aid you in other circumstances", "one of josh\u2019s favorite writers, hemingway, had a practice of ending his writing sessions mid-flow and mid-sentence", "this way, he knew exactly where to start the next day and he could reliably both end and start his sessions with confidence", "to turn it on, learn to turn it off and vice versa", "marcelo garcia, who we were talking about, one of my most beautiful memories of him and world championships, right before going into the semi-finals", "[inaudible]", "everyone\u2019s screaming, yelling", "he\u2019s sleeping", "sleeping in the bleachers", "you\u2019d wake him up", "he\u2019d sort of stumble into the ring", "you\u2019ve never seen a guy more relaxed before going into a world championship fight", "then he can turn it off so deeply, and man, when he goes in the ring, you can\u2019t turn it on with any more intensity than he can", "his ability to turn it off is directly aligned with how intensely he can turn it on", "so training people to do this, have stress and recovery, undulation throughout their day", "the little things are the big things", "we\u2019re talking about marcelo talking about embodying the principle of quality", "in all these little ways \u2013 these little ways you could say don\u2019t matter, but they add up to matter hugely", "i think the little things are the big things, right", "yeah", "because they\u2019re a reflection \u2013 i mean, this might sound clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s like how you do anything is how you do everything", "it\u2019s such a beautiful, incredible principle", "most people think they can wait around for the big moments to turn it on", "but if you don\u2019t cultivate turning it on as a way of life in the little moments \u2013 and there\u2019s hundreds more times little moments than big \u2013 then there\u2019s no chance in the big moments", "just go around for life", "lateral thinking or thematic thinking \u2013 the ability to take a lesson from one thing and transfer it over \u2013 i think is one of the most important disciplines that any of us can cultivate or ways of being", "it\u2019s something that jack and i have, from a really young age, we began to cultivate this from when he was really small around this principle of \u201cgo around.\u201d the first time it happened, he was really tiny", "we were in a little cottage on martha\u2019s vineyard, a tiny little cottage in a big field", "he was trying to get in one door and he couldn\u2019t, but he could get in the other door", "i said, \u201cjack, go around.\u201d he looked at me and then he went around", "and then \u201cgo around\u201d became a language for us physically", "if you can\u2019t go one way, you go around, turn another way", "but then it became a language for us in terms of solving puzzles and in terms of anytime you run into an obstacle, go around", "then working with the metaphor of go around opened up this way that we would just have dialogue around connecting things", "taking a principle from one thing and applying it to something else", "we\u2019ve had a lot of fun with that", "embrace your funk", "that\u2019s a term my buddy, graham, who\u2019s a dear friend of ours who comes on our surf adventures with us", "he\u2019s a brilliant thought partner", "\u201cembrace the funk.\u201d could you explain that", "yeah, we have to embrace our funk", "we have to figure out what \u2013 you think about the entanglement of genius and madness or brilliance and eccentricity", "understanding that entanglement is always a precursor to working with anybody who\u2019s trying to be world-class at something, because that entanglement is fundamental to their being", "they have to ultimately embrace their funk; embrace their eccentricity; embrace what makes them different and then build on it", "who do you pick when your ego seems threatened", "it\u2019s very interesting to observe who the top competitors pick out when they\u2019re five rounds into the sparring sessions and they\u2019re completely gassed", "the ones who are on the steepest growth curve look for the hardest guy there, the one who will beat them up or who might beat them up", "while others will look for someone they can take a break on", "the importance of language on a rainy day", "one of the biggest mistakes that i observed in the first year of jack\u2019s life or year or two of jack\u2019s life that i observed with parents is that they have this language around weather; weather being good or bad", "whenever it was raining, they\u2019d be like, it\u2019s bad weather", "you\u2019d hear moms, babysitters, dads talk about if it\u2019s bad weather, we can\u2019t go out or if it\u2019s good weather, we can go out", "so that means that somehow we\u2019re externally reliant on conditions being perfect in order to be able to go out and have a good time", "so jack and i never missed a single storm", "every rain storm", "i don\u2019t think we\u2019ve missed one storm, other than one maybe when he was sick", "but i don\u2019t think we\u2019ve missed a single storm, rain or snow, going outside and romping in it", "we developed this language around how beautiful it was", "so now whenever there\u2019s a rainy day, jack says, \u201clook, da-da", "it\u2019s such a beautiful rainy day.\u201d and we go out and we play in it", "i wanted him to have this internal locus of control", "to not be reliant on external conditions being just so"]}
