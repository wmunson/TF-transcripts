Stanton:\u00a0Thanks, Tim. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I really appreciate you making the time. And I\u2019ve been following your work for quite a few years now. And I\u2019m excited to have a chance to pick at some of the earlier days and explore questions that have been on my mind for a few years now. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0All right. Pick away. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, the first question I wanted to take a stab at is actually one I\u2019m borrowing from another Georgian and that is Joe Gebbia, the cofounder of Airbnb who likes to ask this question. Do you remember the first time you got in trouble? Or one of the first times you got in trouble? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Oh, God. The first time I got in trouble. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Or a notable time that you got in trouble when you were younger. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, a notable time I remember, I was sitting. And my mom used to take us to the grocery store a lot of times after school. And she was just gonna run in for a few minutes and grab something. And so, we were just supposed to sit in the car. And I think I was like, nine or ten. And I wasn\u2019t supposed to touch anything, but there were all these buttons on the dashboard and things like that. And I remember she came back out, and I think the alarm\u2019s going off, and then the steering wheel\u2019s locked, and you can\u2019t move the car. And I remember that one very vaguely because I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to the fall festival at the school that year which it was my favorite thing to do because they had carnival games and things like that. So, going back in my mind about a painful early time of getting in trouble, that comes into mind. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0As I was doing homework for this conversation, I was reading up on some of the earlier days. And the particular sense that I wanted to explore was in a previous interview of yours. And it covers quite a bit. But it said, \u201cAfter having flunked out of college and later going back and graduating as a history major with straight As\u2026\u201d and then it goes on to say a number of other things. But did you get into a lot of trouble as a kid? Or what led to the flunking out of college? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Right. Well, I always say that a lot of my early trouble was coming from this thought that I had to do something really big in the world. And I\u2019m sitting in class all day, and I\u2019m learning these very minute details about things like the Magna Carta and the Compromise of 18 whatever. And none of this really seemed important at all because I felt that my purpose had to be much greater than this. And then how am I gonna use any of this in life? And so, I spent all of my time \u2013 back then, I was smoking a lot of weed and just trying to think about what my big idea and what my contribution to the world was going to be. And instead of going to class, I was doing that. Instead of working to improve myself, I was doing that, just pontificating and then just thinking all the time about what my contribution to the world was going to be. And that was the time that I flunked out. And things really started moving forward for me was when I threw in the towel. I waved the white flag. I said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna stop trying to figure out what the big thing I\u2019m supposed to accomplish is, and I\u2019m just going to start doing what I was supposed to do.\u201d And I started riding the bus and started going to community college, Georgia Perimeter College. I got my grades back up. I went back to the University of Georgia where I flunked out of. And I focused on becoming a disciplined person and having a routine in my life of working out every day, playing piano every single day, doing my homework. And it\u2019s funny because when I stopped trying to think about this big thing that I was going to accomplish in life and started just focusing on putting one foot in front of the other every single day, it began to propel me on the journey that ultimately led to Humans of New York which was something bigger than I could have ever imagined when I was hitting the bong in the Creswell dorm at the University of Georgia. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now this preoccupation that you had with your big contribution to the world, I don\u2019t know how common that is. I didn\u2019t have that preoccupation. Did that come from parents? Did that come from a book you read? Where did that come from? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Psychedelic mushrooms might have had a little something to do with it. I spent so much time \u2013 I had a very intelligent group of friends. And so much of my 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 was just partaking in these recreational activities, trying to figure out what is truth, what is the meaning of all of this, and all of these big questions, compared to which, these intricacies of things like calculus and algebra and verb conjugations and French and all these subjects I was being forced to do in school seemed so minor and not useful to what I really wanted to understand. And alongside these big questions about why are we here and what is this all about came this feeling \u2013 and I think some kind of vague spirituality was wrapped up in it as well \u2013 that this world is so amazing. And the fact that we\u2019re here is so amazing. And doing anything less than something amazing is squandering this whole reason that you\u2019re here. And I think that was the kind of thinking that brought me down this path that I was \u2013 my time was too good. And my thoughts, the space in my brain was too precious to fill it up with all this homework and this stuff that seemed so unimportant. And so, instead, I just spent all my time just grappling with these bigger things. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What was it like growing up in Marietta, Georgia? Am I right? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And were you born in Georgia, also? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yeah. I was born in Georgia. I am somebody who has liked everywhere I\u2019ve ever been. I liked my school. I liked my college. I liked the community college I went to after I flunked out of my college. I liked Atlanta. I like Chicago. I love New York. I\u2019m generally somebody who appreciates the place that I\u2019m in. I tend to find that people complaining about where they live \u2013 not always. There\u2019s always some place that you can be that might be better for you. But if you hate the place that you live, if you just despise it, I find that a lot of times, a new environment is not the key to your happiness because I find that a lot of times that people that are complaining about one place when they move to another place, then \u2013 if they live in Atlanta and the answer\u2019s New York, then when they get to New York, \u201cYou know what? New York\u2019s dead. The answer\u2019s LA.\u201d When they get to LA, \u201cOh, the American values suck. Need to get to Paris.\u201d When they get to Paris, \u201cOh, the west, it\u2019s so materialistic. I need to go to India.\u201d You know what I mean? So, I find a lot of times the people who externalize their environment as being the reason for their dissatisfaction tend to be unsatisfied everywhere. I\u2019m the opposite. I\u2019ve loved every place that I\u2019ve lived. I\u2019ve loved the people that I\u2019ve met and every place I lived. Marietta was Starbucks and Barnes and Noble, but I had a great group of friends. And I enjoyed growing up there. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m just piecing the connective tissue together as I go because I\u2019m really interested \u2013 I don\u2019t know why this is the case but particularly, in the last six months, I\u2019ve been more and more fascinated by the earlier stages with almost everyone I\u2019ve been chatting with. The history major. You graduate with straight As. And then you end up \u2013 and I know you\u2019ve spoken quite a bit about this, so we won\u2019t belabor the point. But you get a job as a bond trader in Chicago is my understanding. And it was the first time that you were embarrassed in front of family and friends about where your life was going. You get this prestigious job. How did you go about choosing that job or finding that job? Or how did it find you from history? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Right. So, the whole reason I became \u2013 to catch you up a little bit, when I first went to the University of Georgia, I was majoring in business. That\u2019s when I wasn\u2019t going to class. I flunked out. And then when I decided to go back to college, I thought to myself, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just going to study something that I enjoy anyway, so it\u2019s not this major force of effort to go to class and to do my work.\u201d At that time, I had developed a reading habit. That was really when my life turned around because remember, I stopped thinking about these big problems I wanted to solve, and I started focusing on establishing a routine and some discipline in my life. And one of the first big ones and still probably the most monumental routine that I ever established and decision I ever made was that I was going to read 100 pages a day, mostly nonfiction. And whether the book was The Little Prince, or it was something like, The Wealth of Nations, whether it took me an hour or whether it took me eight hours, every single day, I was going to read 100 pages. And I did that for years. Even when I went back to school, in addition to my schoolwork, I would read 100 pages. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Sorry to interrupt, but what catalyzed that decisions? Was there \u2013 Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Psychologically, it was this feeling of being maybe behind. One of the very first books that I read was this autobiography of Ben Franklin. And he has all these \u2013 he did the Poor Richard\u2019s Almanac, and he has all these sayings. And I remember first of all, Ben Franklin himself was kind of the pioneer in getting self-improvement down to a science. You know what I mean? So, his example, first of all, of how much effort he put into improving himself and moving himself forward. And then I remember he had this one quote that uneducated genius is like finding silver in the mine. And it made me think that I had spent all of this time thinking and pondering, and I thought that school was beneath me and school was boring. And because of that, I really hadn\u2019t been imbibing much information. And at that time, something flipped. And I felt like I\u2019ve missed out on probably the last four or six years of education because I was just doing the minimum. I was just getting by and writing my papers before class. I was probably looking at the person\u2019s next to me paper a few times. So, even though I was making okay grades, I really wasn\u2019t taking in a lot of information and educating myself. And so, I think that at that time, I decided I was going to become extremely educated. And I did. I did become an extremely educated person. But 95 percent of that education was outside of school. 95 percent of that education was over the course of seven or eight years saying I\u2019m going to read 100 pages of nonfiction a day, every single day. And I did it for seven or eight years. I\u2019d say 60 percent of that was biography. I would say another 20 percent of it was history. And I would read fiction too when I was absolutely tired of eating my vegetables. That\u2019s what I would call the most boring books, the really conceptual ones I just viewed as vegetables. It was sometimes hard to get through. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The fiber of knowledge. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yeah. But it grows. And it develops you. But yeah. So, biographies were the ones that I was really, really drawn to. And so, at the time, I started reading all these biographies. And I was loving it. And biography is just history. Biography is the best form of history if you ask me because it cuts through the theory, it cuts through all the speculation of the author, and we get d own to the nuts and the bolts of the decisions that people made in their lives. And I think that is the purest form of education that you can get. And it is the advice that I give people who don\u2019t know what they wanna do with their lives. Pick somebody that you admire and read their biography. Read their biography. If you really want some sort of guidance in your life, pick somebody who\u2019s done things that you want to do and that you really admire and read a nice, fat, 800-page biography of their lives. Find out the struggles they went through. Find out the twists and turns of their lives and the decisions they made. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any better actionable road map, actionable education than getting down in the granular level of somebody\u2019s life and finding out how they navigated it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If someone wanted to \u2013 let\u2019s just say that they are having a lapse of concentration and can\u2019t think of people they admire who have biographies, if you were to recommend any one to three biographies as gateway drugs into that world, are there any that come to mind? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0It depends upon what you wanna accomplish in life. If you\u2019re just flagging, and you don\u2019t know what you wanna do, start with Ben Franklin. Start with somebody who is very disciplined and programmatic in figuring out how to develop themselves. Again, my advice always to people who are stuck is quit looking at the big picture. People get stuck because they wanna accomplish too big of things and they don\u2019t know the right step to take. So, I always say instead of focusing on the year, instead of focusing on the arc of your life, focus on the 24-hour period. And nobody mastered the 24-hour period more than Benjamin Franklin. So, if you have no idea what you wanna do, start there, I would say. If you know what you wanna do, you gotta pick the person that you admire the most. Do you want to participate in social movements? Pick Martin Luther King. Do you wanna be president of the United States? If you wanna be president of the United States, I would recommend Lyndon Johnson. Lyndon Johnson because he was probably the president that was given the least in his life except for maybe Abraham Lincoln. He didn\u2019t go to ivy league. He wasn\u2019t necessarily a great looking guy. He went to San Marcos Teacher College. And again, this is if you wanna be president. I don\u2019t wanna be president. He worked his way up through understanding how the levers of democracy work, the levers of power and our government work. And so, he is a fascinating character sketch on how to be president. If you wanna read a Lyndon Johnson biography, you should read the four-volume biography by Robert Caro which is the best of those. But other than that, it all depends upon what it is that you wanna do in life. There\u2019s just no biography that every person should read. They should pick the person that they admire the most and read the biography of their life. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0With Ben Franklin, would it be a biography like Walter Isaacson? Or would you \u2013 Brandon Stanton:\u00a0The Isaacson one was the one I read. And that stands out the most because it was the first. The person that I\u2019ve read the most biographies on, probably Theodore Roosevelt just because his life is so fascinating. Probably Adolf Hitler. Probably Stalin. And it\u2019s not because in any way these people are admirable. But as a history major, to me, it wasn\u2019t the individual themseelf that was fascinating. To me, it was how does a group of people \u2013 Germany was a smart, industrialized country. To me, the big, philosophical question that fascinated me and the reason that I delved so much into the lives and the practices of the dictators is how is it that a group of such educated, smart, well-meaning people were able to be organized under the premise of committing such evil. And that, to me, has always fascinated me because I believe that people are inherently good. And I\u2019ve traveled to 30 or 40 different countries. And it\u2019s funny. Every place has a reputation. \u201cOh, don\u2019t go to this city. People won\u2019t talk to you.\u201d So many times when I land in a place, they say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t gonna work here. People aren\u2019t open here. People aren\u2019t friendly here.\u201d And I find one on one, people all over the world are very \u2013 they share a similar soul, I guess. And if people are generally the same everywhere, then that means anywhere, something like this could happen. Anywhere, people can get pulled into this crowd psychology and direct their anger and their hatred and violence towards people in a way that would contradict their morals if you met them one on one. And because of that, the lives and the periods of history that have always been most intellectually interesting to me \u2013 again, it\u2019s not something I admire. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m looking to duplicate of course \u2013 have been these periods where a very driven, ideological, individual has managed to mobilize a group of people towards ends that looking back from a historical perspective were brutal and violent and absolutely unexplainable. And I think it\u2019s important to understand these things to keep it from happening again. Do you remember you asked about bond trading like \u2013? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, I do. Oh, no. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0 \u2013 two questions ago. I never even talked about it. Well, the whole reason I think I started talking about history is because bond trading was really an anomaly in my life. I was really wrapped up in all these things that we\u2019re talking about now. I was really wrapped up in history and biography, mainly. When Obama, he was \u2013 God, what was it? 2008, 2007? I think it was 2007. He was in the primary. And I really became fixated on this campaign. And I was going to knock on doors and \u2013 this was during the primary when he was going up against Hillary. And I was knocking on doors. I was going to different states, knocking on doors. And I was reading every article about the delegate system and super delegates. And there was this point where I was just absolutely positive he was going to win. This is the primary. I was just absolutely positive he was going to win. And I was broke at the time. This is not something I would ever do today. But I took out $5,000.00 in student loans, and I actually bet on Barak Obama would win the presidency. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Where does one bet on something like that? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Back then it was an Irish exchange. It has since gone under. It was called In-Trade. And I think they had him at like, 40 percent chance to win at that time. And he had a 70 percent chance of [inaudible] [00:29:27] or something. And so, I didn\u2019t make a ton of money off of it because it took me a week to wire my money to Ireland. And in the time that I was wiring my money, he had won a couple more times. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, the odds changed. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Exactly. And so, I ended up only ma \u2013 I made like, $1,000.00, $1,200.00, which for me, as a college student, was all the money in the world. But more fatefully, I was telling that story just like I\u2019m telling it to you to a friend of mine who worked in Chicago. And he was a trader. He was a bond trader. And I was telling him that story. And he told me, \u201cThe one differentiator between successful traders and unsuccessful traders in our office is their comfort with risk taking. And based on that story, I would like you to talk to my boss.\u201d And so \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Based on the extreme prudency you\u2019ve demonstrated with that story. Well, yeah. I think it was the comfort with risk taking. And so, at that time, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do again. I just studied history because I enjoyed it. I really enjoyed it. And so, he got me an interview with his boss. And it was scheduled. And this is somebody who went to an ivy league school and he had studied finance his entire life, and he had gotten this job. So, I thought this was an opportunity I would not have any other way. And I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do at the time. I was a history major. And so, I had a month to prepare. So, I read about 20 books on the market. And then I went into the interview. And at that time, I was very well versed on how markets worked. And that\u2019s how I got that job. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Good thing you had all that reading practice. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yo. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What was your first week as a bond trader like? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0See, this is the \u2013 and I always try to say when I \u2013 if somebody\u2019s just listened to this interview up until this point, I think we talk about bond trading and dictators which really has nothing to do with my life now. And I think the narrative that people in interviews always try to put on me is that \u2013 because it\u2019s a fun narrative \u2013 oh, chasing the money, doing this soul-sucking finance job and then cut the rope behind him to pursue his true passion which was taking photographs and art. And there\u2019s a kernel of truth there. But the real story is that markets were fascinating to me. I\u2019m still fascinated by markets. They seem so tangible when you\u2019re watching CNBC and you\u2019re seeing these numbers. And it seems all so mathematical. But in reality, markets are nothing but a bunch of people arguing over what something\u2019s worth. If you remove the computer and go back 50 years, a market is a crowd of people haggling over what something that is impossible to value is worth. And the number that comes out of it is really based on psychology. And it\u2019s based on this back and forth over what these numbers mean. And that was always so interesting to me. And it remains very interesting to me. So, I was philosophically very interested in markets. And I was fascinated by bond trading. And I was obsessed with it, to be honest, for two years. And it was a type of bond trading where you\u2019re very highly leveraged. And so, it was a type where there was just huge gains or huge losses every single night. I compare it to playing a very high stakes game of poker every single night. And so, it was extremely \u2013 I don\u2019t think I could do it today. I was in my early 20s at the time. There was just adrenaline pumping through my body at all times. When you take something that you\u2019re naturally philosophically interested in and you pair it with a large amount of money and a large amount of excitement, it creates this fixation. It\u2019s almost like crack where it\u2019s just all you can think about at any given time. And when I go to colleges and I give speeches on the path of Humans of New York and what led me to pursue this life that was outside of books and outside of computer screens was that after the end of two years, when I lost my job, I looked back at the time that I had spent that two years. And it wasn\u2019t the physical time that was lost that was most concerning to me. It was that I had spent two years using all of my intellect and all of my creative energy trying to figure out how to be the most effective relative value trader and fixed income securities in the Asian markets. It was just something that was so narrow and so myopic. And I couldn\u2019t even talk with my friends about it. And at the end of two years, we\u2019d gone through the financial crisis. I\u2019d lost everything I\u2019d ever made. When I lost that job \u2013 it was a very lucrative job potentially. But when I lost that job, I was broke because I\u2019d lost everything. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why did you lose the job? What happened? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, it depends upon how much personal responsibility I wanna take. I think the narrative that\u2019s most protective of the ego is that we had a type of trading that was calibrated to work during periods of low volatility. The years from I guess 1995 or whatever \u2013 I don\u2019t know when my math is right but late \u201890s to 2008 were periods of historically low volatility where the type of trading that we were doing worked. And when the financial crisis hit in 2008, volatility went through the roof. Long story short, the type of trading that we were doing stopped working. And the company that had been around for over a decade was out of business about a year after I left. So, that\u2019s the way of explaining that avoids the most personal responsibility. If I was to explain it in the way that makes myself the most personally responsible, markets changed, and I wasn\u2019t adaptive enough to figure it out. I kept banging my head against the same things that used to be working. I refused to fully embrace the fact that what worked for me extremely well for a year had stopped working. And because of that, the risk calculations had changed. And instead of making a lot of money every night, I was losing a lot of money every night. And I eventually got to the point where I was no longer a productive member of the firm. And so, yeah. It depends up on which story you wanna tell. I think the truth is probably somewhere in between the two. But regardless, I ended up without a job. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, thank you for sharing both versions of that. No, I think that that also reflects a level of \u2013 this may not be the right word but objectivity or ability to detach and observe that has always fascinated me about you, quite frankly, which certainly translates I think in a very empathic way later. And we\u2019ll get to that. But I wanna talk about the finance world and markets for just a second because, as you noted, it\u2019s very tempting for someone who\u2019s trying to weave a narrative of your life into this soul-sucking period, sees the light, cuts the tether, burns the ships, off into the arts and true passion. But the markets, as you noted, are really fascinating. And I was chatting with someone I\u2019ve just gotten to know actually in the last few weeks. I suppose you could call him a wealth manager. But 75 percent of what he does is invest in bonds. He probably wouldn\u2019t call it trading, but in effect, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. And he said something to me that has stuck in my mind for a while now which is, \u201cI learn more in the first two to four hours of sitting down and talking to someone about money than their therapists have probably learned over the last two to four years.\u201d And getting to see how people respond to money and loss aversion and the possibility of making money is in and of itself fascinating. Then you add in thousands and millions of market participants, it gets even more interesting. And then, at least in my limited experience, when I read something \u2013 my exposure to bonds is very limited. But when you read something like Liar\u2019s Poker by Michael Lewis which I think is a fantastic book \u2013 and the part that stuck out to me where I was like, \u201cOkay. I need to be very careful about playing this game because I\u2019ll get my face ripped off,\u201d is there\u2019s some part \u2013 and I\u2019m gonna get all the details wrong \u2013 but there\u2019s some guy who\u2019s nicknamed Fat Tony. And he\u2019s a big wig at Solomon Brothers. And he bets his buddies that the markets for whatever, AA bonds and X, Y, and Z are going up. And he bets them. And it\u2019s this dick measuring contest. And he puts $50 million into the market, and it goes down. And so, his friends are busting his balls. And then they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, market\u2019s going up, huh?\u201d And so, instead of putting $50 million in, he\u2019s like, \u201cFuck it.\u201d And he puts $500 million in. And all the other market participants panic thinking that he has information they don\u2019t. And so, the market goes up. And he says, \u201cSee? I told you the market was going up.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, my God. This is not nearly as clean as the textbooks would want you to believe.\u201d Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, as somebody who\u2019s interviewed 10,000 people, I would say that talking with somebody about their money and how they choose to use their money will give you an insight into a very limited \u2013 and I mean, maybe I\u2019m wrong \u2013 but a very limited aspect of their personality which is their comfort with risk. And I think our approach to money and our approach to trading and our approach to markets are very much driven by our animal spirits, greed and fear and things like that. But I feel that there is a huge portion of people\u2019s lives and thought lives that are separate and isolated from those drives, those very primal drives of wanting more and being afraid to lose. That\u2019s really what drives the markets is the greed and the fear. And I think talking with somebody about those two drives and where their greed comes from and where their fear comes from, it\u2019ll give you some insight. But to me, the markets, they can only tell you so much. And they can only \u2013 it\u2019s a part of human existence, the drives that control a market. But there\u2019s so much that people care about outside of that. And I think that was what was so dangerous about just being a trader is that you\u2019re burying so much of your thought energy into just the desire for more and the fear of losing. You know what I mean? The kind of narrow animalistic drives that push a market up and down, and you\u2019re tethering yourself to that. And you just miss out on so much of the life that\u2019s going on around you. And this is me. This is me. I think it\u2019s part of my personality that once I dive into something, I do it to the exclusion of almost everything else. One of the reasons Humans of New York ended up becoming so successful, I did know some of \u2013 it\u2019s more the exception than the rule. There are people who are so in control of their emotions or maybe they don\u2019t have the same emotional range as other people that are able to turn off their computer every single day, go home, and not think about the markets and completely leave them there. But for me, it was something that was all-consuming for me. And when I made the decision to pursue something more artistic was when I had lost my job. And I was looking back at the two years of my life. And I was thinking, \u201cGod.\u201d And after I lost my job, I was so scared of that day. During the two years when I was obsessing over markets and then things started going back, there was nothing I was more afraid of than losing that job. And then on the day that it happened, it was surprisingly a good day because I remember taking a walk that day. And I started asking myself things like, \u201cWhat do I wanna do? What do I wanna do? If I could do anything with my time, what would I do?\u201d And I had been for two years so focused on keeping that job that I didn\u2019t have room in my brain to ask myself any other questions. And so, at that moment, I decided I\u2019ve lost these two years of not only my time, but more importantly, I\u2019ve lost two years of my thoughts focusing on this game for making money which was fascinating and philosophically interesting. But when you boil it down, it\u2019s a game. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna spend the next foreseeable future instead of spending my time trying to make money, I\u2019m gonna try to make just enough money to where I can control my time and just do something that I enjoy doing for no other reason than it is nourishing in the moment, not that at the end of the day I\u2019m gonna have a profit but because it\u2019s nourishing in the moment.\u201d And at that time, it was photography. And the whole reason I think one of the neatest things about Humans of New York is that over the past eight years, Humans of New York has become largely the most followed photography project in the world with I think 25 million on social media now. And it\u2019s eight years old. And I think one of the coolest things is I just started photographing about eight years ago. I started taking photos during this time that I\u2019m talking to you about. And the whole reason I started taking photos was because I was trying to create some space in my mind away from work. I was desperate for something to do on the weekends that would give me this foothold in my brain where I had a sense of purpose and a sense of identity outside how the markets were doing every single day. And so, I bought this camera. I started going to downtown Chicago and photographing just everything. And I loved it. And not long after, I lost my job. And I made the decision that I was gonna be a photographer not because I was very skilled at it at the time, not because I thought it was an angle towards success, and not because I thought it was an angle towards an audience. It was that I just loved doing it in the moment. It was nourishing in the moment. And so, I found this thing that was nourishing in the moment that I enjoyed doing. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try to structure my life around creating as much time for this as possible. I want to make just enough money to where I can pay my rent, eat, and photograph all day long.\u201d And the journey that ended up creating Humans of New York was my attempt to create that space in my life and that space in my head to focus on something that was very nourishing in the moment. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did you cover your expenses in the very early days of that experience? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0This was 2008. We had I believe a record amount of time that you could get unemployment. And I had just lost my job. And so, I got $620.00 I think every two weeks from the government because I was unemployed, and I had worked for two years. So, that was enough to basically just pay my rent in a sublease that I found on Craigslist in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn that was enough to pay that and maybe have peanut butter jelly sandwiches and eggs, assuming that you needed no other expenses, that you wore the same clothes and the same shoes. That was enough for me to just eat, sleep, and photograph all day long. And once I got to have a decent level of skill, and I mean just a passable level of skill, if anybody would pay me to take portraits for them, I would do that. Somebody hired me to do their wedding. And I didn\u2019t spend money on anything. All I did was photograph all day long because I knew that I was making this pivot in my life to where I was going after a lucrative career towards I was going toward just wanting to spend my time doing something all day long. And I became obsessed with photography in the same way that I was obsessed with markets. I loved it. I just loved it. It was like a treasure hunt, just going out. And it was so different than trading too. I\u2019m outside. I\u2019m interacting with the world. I\u2019m having conversations. I\u2019m having these little adventures and discovering these new things. And I was just hooked on it. And I was just obsessed with it. And I knew I was making a lot of sacrifices to be doing this in my life, so I didn\u2019t do anything else. I didn\u2019t go to concerts. I didn\u2019t go out to restaurants. I didn\u2019t spend much time with friends because I didn\u2019t really know anybody in New York. That\u2019s another crazy detail about Humans of New York is that Humans of New York is an eight-year-old photography project based on people in New York City. I took my first photograph eight years ago. And I went to New York for the very first time in my life eight years ago. So, it was all just very new and all very driven by the desire to photograph all day long. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Was the move to New York related to the desire to take photographs? Or was it something else? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0So, what I did is \u2013 so, I got fired, and I started \u2013 my goal was I wanna find out how to be a photographer. I love photography. How am I gonna create a life where I can support myself and photograph all day long? So, I was just outdoing it every single day. And then I started \u2013 along with the graffiti and along with the architectural shots and along with the nature shots, I started photographing people. And I noticed that out of everything I was photographing, the photographs of people were the most unique. They\u2019re the ones that least resembled everything else I was seeing being put on Facebook and stuff like that. And so, I decided to focus on that. And then, while focusing on that, I started stopping people on the street and asking for their photo and taking a portrait of them. And because of that extra layer of difficulty of having to approach a stranger, the portraits that I was taking of people were more different than the candid photos I was taking of people. And so, I started focusing solely on that. And that\u2019s when I started having an idea that even though I hadn\u2019t been photographing so long, I was heading in a direction that was pretty unique because I was stopping random people on the streets in a very \u2013 I know some people will do series, but I was doing this every single day. And I was getting quite a collection. And this seemed like a fresh type of photography. So, it\u2019s all I did. And then I started traveling to different cities. I went to Philadelphia just stopping people. Then I went to New Orleans. I went back to Atlanta and did this. And then I traveled to New York. And when I got to New York and I was stopping people and asking for their photographs, I realized that New York, if you were going to try to do this type of photography was the best place to be. Mainly just practical reasons that you don\u2019t need a car in New York. I didn\u2019t have a car, and I couldn\u2019t afford a car. You can just ride the subway everywhere. You can walk everywhere. And there are so many people. There are so many people. I remember coming out of the Lincoln Tunnel the very first time, and I couldn\u2019t even see the sidewalk because it was rush hour. And there were so many people. And I thought, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do this type of photography, this is the place to do it.\u201d And I wasn\u2019t doing any interviews at this time. And that\u2019s the thing. The Humans of New York that I moved to New York to do looks nothing like the Humans of New York that later became successful. It was really just the impetus to get me on the ground working every day to figure it out along the way. My very first idea for Humans of New York was I was going to photograph 10,000 people in New York City across all five boroughs, and I was gonna plot their photo on a map. That was my idea of how I was going to make a life out of being a photographer. I was gonna be the guy who did that. And that was what got me on the ground, got me out on the street every single day approaching hundreds and thousands of people and put me in the situation where I could innovate and I could start having conversations with these people which turned into questions I was asking them which turned into eventually, seven years later, the 90-minute to an hour and a half long very probing and therapeutic and psychological interviews that I have with random strangers every single day. The result of which and the output of which became the stories that I think people are so connected with and the stories that really make Humans of New York Humans of New York. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How are you getting better at photography during this first, let\u2019s just call it six-month period since you certainly seem from all indications to be someone who goes for total immersion whether it\u2019s reading 10 to 20 books on the markets before an interview, you go 100 percent into whatever subject matter you choose. How are you getting better? What books were you reading? Who were you studying? What were you trying? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0I was too addicted to taking photos to ever stop for a second and learn about photography. I have one memory of going to Barnes and Noble \u2013 because I couldn\u2019t afford to buy any books. I have one memory of going to Barnes and Noble one night and flipping through some photography books and enjoying the photos. But I just wanted to be out taking pictures. I didn\u2019t really wanna be studying how to take a correct photo. I just wanted to be out photographing. It was the act of it, the act of discovery. And I had a very amateur view of photography at the time where as if you get something or somebody interesting in the frame, it\u2019s a great photo. I don\u2019t care how many points perspective it has. I don\u2019t care about the rules of thirds. I honestly don\u2019t really even care about white balance or focus or any of these things. I was just looking for wonderful people and wonderful moments that were happening. I was still doing a lot of candid photography of people. And if I captured that, that was a good photo. And that\u2019s all I cared about. And that was what was driving me for these first several months and this first year, year and a half when I took thousands and thousands of pictures. And I was getting better slowly. I\u2019m not necessarily bragging about that kind of a version to formal training as if it was some sort of badge of honor. It was just the way my psychology was hardwired. And because of that, I might have improved more slowly than somebody else. And in fact, I might have improved so slowly that I\u2019m sure a lot of professional photographers look down on my photography still. But by being that engaged an immersed in the process as opposed to any sort of a formal structure of what makes a photograph, I innovated my own style. I innovated my own type of work that later on \u2013 people have introduced me to Studs Terkel, and people introduced me to these wonderful photographers of the past, Jacob Riis, who took these wonderful photos of regular people that my work grew to resemble just came out of being on the street and doing it all day long and figuring out what it was that I liked the most and without any education of what a correct photograph was. And I think if Humans of New York has original elements, if Humans of New York is original in any way, it was because I was just so addicted to taking photos that I never stopped to learn about photography. And because of that, I was figuring it out as I went along. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, it seems to me also that there are many different facets of photography, one component of which is the technical knowledge, but certainly component of which is choosing the subject matter and thinking about the story that an image tells. So, you were learning about photography, but you were doing it vis-\u00e0-vis the sheer volume of experience that you were gathering behind the camera and walking through New York City. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Right. Well, I was looking for anyone who \u2013 anything that captured my attention or curiosity at all got photographed. And that\u2019s one of the beautiful things about digital cameras is you can just take 1,000 photos every single day. And so, you don\u2019t have to worry about conserving film. You can just photograph everything. And so, anything that caught my eye got photographed. And then when you go home, and you load your 1,000 pictures on the computer, and you start going through, and because you don\u2019t know how to photograph, you photographed that person 50 different times, and you\u2019re looking at your 50 photos of each person, and you\u2019re finding the one that you think looks the best. And then you\u2019re going, and you\u2019re doing it again, and you\u2019re doing it again. And suddenly, you\u2019re not taking 50 photos of each person, you\u2019re taking 40, then 30, then 20, and then 10 as you start to get an idea of what it is that you think is a great photo and what it is that you like. And that was really how I was honing in on my style again which might still be considered primitive. It still might be considered unschooled by a lot of people. But I was just honing in on what I liked about a photo. And that was the process. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What were you doing with these photos in the beginning? Or maybe a better question is when you first started putting photos online, what did that look like? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0One of my main weaknesses and blind spots in the beginning was not understanding the importance of daily content because I had never had a blog before. And so, I had this great \u2013 and it mirrors my journey as a college student where I was trying to do something huge instead of focusing on doing something every single day. And so, I had this huge, sweeping project of I was gonna photograph 10,000 people and plot their photos on a map. I was dumping about 30 or 40 of these portraits every single day onto this website that I had that nobody was going to. I even had a counter on the top of the website counting up to 10,000 because that\u2019s all I cared about was the end. I was gonna get 10,000. I was gonna create this sweeping photography project. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Was it called Humans of New York at the time? Or what was the name? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0It was called Humans of New York from the very beginning, yes. And nobody was really paying attention. And I was taking hundreds and thousands of portraits. And things really started to get traction when I started posting the photos as I got them onto social media, mainly Facebook. That is when things really started to grow. And the focus of Humans of New York moved away from this giant, sweeping project that was going to cover the entire city of New York and be some sort of representation of New York City, and it switched much more to about the individual. Who is this person that I\u2019m meeting each day? And it became something more personal and immediate. And that\u2019s when things really started growing. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Brandon, I\u2019d love to ask you about the green lady if that rings a bell. Could you please describe for folks the experience of the green lady? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0So, I\u2019m in New York, and I\u2019ve been trying to make this work for about six months now. And six months in that time of my life was probably the equivalent about two years of work because I worked every single day. I worked on Christmas. I worked on Thanksgiving. I didn\u2019t go home. All I did was photograph all day long. I would go out. I would just photograph people. I\u2019d come home. I would take a nap. And then I would go out at night and try to get some more photos. And so, I had gotten thousands of these portraits, and not many people were paying attention. I think I had just started posting my photos on Facebook. And I photographed this woman, and she was dressed all in green. And she had green hair and green makeup. And I remember it was a photo that I didn\u2019t like. I thought it was a very bad photo. And I wasn\u2019t even going to really post it on the blog. But then I remembered that she had said something to me. She had said, \u201cI used to be a different color every single day. But then one day, I was green, and that was a great day. And so, I\u2019ve been green for 15 years.\u201d And I remember thinking to myself, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really like the photograph, but I\u2019m gonna try putting this quote above it that she said. And I posted it onto Facebook. And suddenly, it was the most engaged with photo that I\u2019d ever posted. I think we\u2019re talking like, 67 likes at this time. There was not a lot of people following my page. And it was kind of a \u2018eureka\u2019 moment because it really made sense that during these months and almost a year of doing nothing but approaching random people in the street and asking for their photograph, the thing that strangely I had gotten to be an expert at wasn\u2019t the photography, but it was the approaching strangers and the walking up to random people, getting rejected a lot of times and not letting that affect my mood, and then once meeting somebody, in a very short amount of time, making that person comfortable. And the \u2018eureka\u2019 moment was, \u201cIf that is what I\u2019ve become good at, if that is what I have to offer the world, shouldn\u2019t I, now that I\u2019ve gotten over this fear of approaching a stranger, use that opportunity to learn a little bit about this person so that I can share a little bit about this person with other people who might be curious of the people around them but haven\u2019t been able to overcome that fear of talking to strangers?\u201d And it turned out that the audience for that, the amount of people who were curious at the lives of the people around them but were too afraid to ask, ended up being hundreds, then thousands, and then tens of thousands, and millions, and then now tens of millions. And from that moment on, Humans of New York stopped being a photography project. I don\u2019t even view myself as a photographer. You can write a three-page essay about why I\u2019m a horrible photographer. And it\u2019s been done many times. And it doesn\u2019t really bother me because I stopped viewing myself as a photographer a long time ago. The photography\u2019s really secondary to Humans of New York. Humans of New York is my effort in as short of time as possible to make a random person on the street comfortable enough and seeing somebody\u2019s interested enough in their lives that they\u2019ll share their story with me, and they\u2019ll share something deep and vulnerable and real and honest about their lives so that I can share that with millions of people every single night. And Humans of New York, over the past six years, has been my effort to get as good at that as possible. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0This is a perfect segue to asking about the approaches and questions which is \u2013 Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Which is a really important thing. I feel guilty because I spent the entire \u2013 if you look, I have not posted a picture of myself on Humans of New York in years. I don\u2019t do it. I find that Humans of New York is best when I\u2019m the most invisible. I feel that the less Humans of New York is about Brandon Stanton, the more influential Humans of New York has become. So, yeah. it feels very unnatural to have spent an hour talking already and talk nothing about myself. So, please. Fire away. Ask about the work. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, I\u2019m gonna ask about the work. And you can talk about yourself in third person if it makes it feel better. But I will have to involve you in this. What do you say when you cold approach someone on the street, assuming that now, of course, you could use Humans of New York and a lot of people would recognize it, and you could break the ice that way? But early on, when nobody would recognize that, how did you open? And then what did you use to break the ice in the first 60 seconds? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0First thing always is, \u201cDo you mind if I take your photograph?\u201d That was the first thing. And these are all \u2013 little things I learned is you don\u2019t walk up to somebody and ask, \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d because that immediately puts somebody on defensive because \u2013 and especially in New York City \u2013 people are walking up to you all day long trying to sell you something, asking for money. So, people are naturally very defensive. So, I don\u2019t want \u2013 my goal is to get into it as soon as possible so people realize that this is something a little bit different and I\u2019m not looking for their money. That\u2019s the main thing. I\u2019m not looking for their money. So, I normally walk up, and I say, \u201cDo you mind if I take your photograph? I run a website called Humans of New York. And basically, what I do is over the past several years, I\u2019ve photographed about 10,000 people on the streets of New York City and around the world. And I just learn a little bit about everyone I photograph. And so, I was just wondering if I could take your photo and ask you a few questions.\u201d Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now before you had the 10,000 and went around the world, when it was maybe the 100th person or 200th person, was it the same pitch minus that stuff? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yeah. I was trying to give you actually the pitch that I used to give in the early days. Now I pull out my cellphone, two No. 1 New York Times bestselling books, 20 million followers on Facebook. And the whole reason of that, even though it sounds boastful and braggy is that especially if somebody hasn\u2019t heard of Humans of New York, I want to convince them in as short amount of time as possible that it\u2019s something real, one. That\u2019s important. And that it\u2019s something that a lot of people know about and a lot of people follow. It\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s not a prank. You\u2019re not gonna be embarrassed. My goal is in as short amount of time as possible to make the person feel comfortable. And these days, a big part of that is explaining how big the blog is because then it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, this person is not trying to hustle me. This person isn\u2019t trying to scam me.\u201d But to be honest, in the early days, the amount of people who let me take their photo wasn\u2019t that much less. Except back then I wasn\u2019t a bestselling author. I was just a kid who was trying to make an art project. And people wanted to help. And so, I think a lot of people think that one of the reasons so many people are willing to talk to me is because Humans of New York is so well known, especially in New York now. But my rate of people who would talk to me was not all that different when I was just getting started. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Are there any other nonverbal keys to that? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Oh, yeah. Oh, God. There are tons of them. But again, these aren\u2019t things that I planned or read about. It\u2019s not that I \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You had a lot of trial and error. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, they were burned into me by being rejected so much. And some rejections on the streets of New York aren\u2019t always polite. You know what I mean? It was hard. In the early days, I remember there were days \u2013 the hardest part about it was especially when I got started, and Humans of New York didn\u2019t have any fans, and it wasn\u2019t made into any books, and my family didn\u2019t believe in it, and my friends thought I was crazy. I had no photography experience. I\u2019m in New York City stopping random people and asking them questions. And I\u2019m feeling insecure. When you walk up to somebody and you ask them if you can take their photo and they respond like you\u2019re some sort of freak or that you\u2019re weird, it\u2019s hard to not internalize that because you\u2019re so insecure at the moment about whether or not what you\u2019re doing is weird and if it\u2019s something that \u2013 am I weird for asking these people for their photographs? And I\u2019d go out some days, and ten people in a row would make me feel like I\u2019m some sort of freak. Like, \u201cDo you know what city you\u2019re in? You can\u2019t be stopping random people. Get out of my way. What are you doing? No, you can\u2019t take my photo. Get out of here.\u201d And during my formative and impressionable early days when I\u2019m trying to figure this out, five reactions like that in a row when nobody\u2019s paying attention to your work, and you\u2019ve been trying for months, and you can\u2019t figure it out, psychologically was very tough. And there\u2019d be days where that would happen, and I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. And I would just go home and lay in bed. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You there? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You all right? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, it\u2019s just the \u2013 that\u2019s the hardest part about doing it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What would you say to yourself during a period like that? To me at least, the picture that it\u2019s painting, having experienced some dark periods in my life that have been maybe catalyzed by various things, it sounds really soul-crushing. That sounds really \u2013 Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, I was just \u2013 it was all of the doubt, and not having any money, and nobody\u2019s paying attention, and I\u2019m just doing this all day long for months, and all the tough shit was \u2013 and the loneliness too. I didn\u2019t know anybody in New York. I knew two people. And there was a Christmas break where those two people went home, and for two weeks, I didn\u2019t see anybody that I knew. And I remember I spent Christmas Eve alone at a diner. And then I just went out and photographed because it was the only thing that would keep me from thinking about how unlikely it was and how stupid of an idea it might be. The only thing that I think kept me from thinking about the possibility of failing was doing it, was just photographing. And so, whenever I started to think, \u201cIs this gonna work? Is it not gonna work?\u201d I\u2019d just go out and photograph. That was my only way of keeping those wolves away of, \u201cIs this ultimately going to be a success? Am I wasting my time? Am I stupid?\u201d The only way to keep those away was to go out and work. And so, that\u2019s what I would do just all day long and do it and do it and do it. And so, these negative things like the rejection of people and people saying no that I was talking about, all of the negative stuff, the thing that was counteracting that all the time was just loving it so much. I just loved it so much. And so, yeah. It was just the same way I was obsessed with markets. I was obsessed with taking photos. And so, that\u2019s what carried me through it all. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And in listening to this story, it makes me wanna ask you \u2013 when I look at Humans of New York and think about how many thousands of people you\u2019ve humanized and how much empathy you\u2019ve created traveling to other countries, helping to paint a more complete picture of humanity instead of allowing mass media distortion to create us versus them mentality or counteracting that at least to a very real degree and helping millions of people who have been exposed to your work and the interviews to feel less alone, that\u2019s a huge fucking deal. It pains me to hear a story like this. But it\u2019s so helpful for you to share it because I wonder how many people have ended up in that diner alone and just quit. They just stopped. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0t\u2019s not even about stopping. I think Humans of New York wor \u2013 it\u2019s not about goals or mission. I had a goal, and I had a mission. But people just feel alone. Period. That\u2019s why Humans of New York has succeeded. And I\u2019m not even talking about the people reading it. The No. 1 question that people ask me is, \u201cHow do you get people to share with you?\u201d And I think for most people \u2013 and they\u2019re not just if you follow Humans of New York. Yesterday, I was talking with a woman who \u2013 she had not heard of Humans of New York. This is a perfect example. She was catching a train. She had 30 minutes. She had never heard of Humans of New York. We started out with me showing her the blog. And 30 minutes later, the place that we ended up at was she was in this purgatory where her husband was depressed and an alcoholic. And he wasn\u2019t doing anything that was ultimately so bad. He didn\u2019t beat her. He didn\u2019t cheat on her. But she wasn\u2019t getting fulfilled. And she was wondering if she was living her best life by staying with him for the kids. And she came to this place where she admitted that she was secretly hoping that he would do something bad to make the decision easier on her. And that sort of honesty and that sort of truth and that sort of rawness \u2013 I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d even admitted that to herself before. And people ask me \u2013 and that happens all the time, Tim. That\u2019s good Humans of New York. Some of it\u2019s just pictures of kids saying cute stuff, and some of it\u2019s cute couples talking about their relationship. But good Humans of New York is when we get to that moment when me and somebody are thinking through something or talking through something that they might not have thought through before. And the way people say, \u201cHow do you get there with a complete stranger?\u201d I think that whenever I\u2019m talking to somebody on the street, there are two threads running through their head at any given time. And one of them is this fear of being exposed, this feeling of being vulnerable and discomfort. \u201cWho is this guy? Why is he asking me these questions?\u201d And on the other hand, there is this appreciation of being heard that even though I don\u2019t know this guy, this is the first person who has taken such a focused and detailed interest in my problems. And the feeling of having somebody focus so intensely not on the sports teams you like or the music you like or any of the other trivial things that we get asked on a daily basis but these real things that you\u2019re struggling with and maybe not even on the top of your mind but in the back of your mind that you\u2019re not even really bringing to the surface, being heard like that is such a validating thing that that\u2019s why people always share. And I tell people at the beginning of every interview that these questions are going to be hard. And anything you don\u2019t wanna answer you don\u2019t have to answer. And we talked about when they got molested as a child. We talk about them cheating on their husbands. We talk about their alcoholism. We talk about how they don\u2019t love their child as much as they expected they would. We talk about all these things. And almost never to people say, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about that. I don\u2019t wanna talk about that.\u201d And I think the reason Humans of New York works isn\u2019t because the people who are reading it feel alone. That\u2019s a big part of it. It\u2019s that people, when they see somebody being vulnerable in a way that they\u2019re afraid to be vulnerable themselves, they connect with that person. But it really works because the people on the street that I meet are so thankful to have somebody really listen to them that in that bubble, in an hour and a half where I\u2019m sitting with a stranger on the street, this magic happens where they\u2019re willing to let me in to a space in their mind or their soul or whatever it is that they don\u2019t really let other people into. And it\u2019s that place that I think connects with so many people. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0That\u2019s an incredible gift/talent that you\u2019ve developed that allows you to make people comfortable enough to open up to that extent in 30 minutes. That is incredibly impressive to me, even give the fact that perhaps one of the elements underpinning it is how heard they feel which is absolutely, I\u2019m sure, the case. I think about questions a lot. And you have much more experience than I do. And that just blows me away that you\u2019re able to get there in such a short period of time. What are some of the other ingredients or aspects of it that help you to \u2013 questions perhaps that help you to get there? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0It\u2019s not the questions. I have about three or four entry questions that I use. \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest struggle?\u201d \u201cHow has your life turned out differently than you expected it to?\u201d \u201cWhat do you feel most guilty about?\u201d But really, the planned questions are just springboards into a conversation. And how you get to that deep place with a person is absolute presence. It\u2019s being 100 percent there. You\u2019re not thinking in the framework of an interview. You\u2019re not looking at a list of questions. You\u2019re not thinking about your next question. You\u2019re not thinking about how this person fits into your idea of them and what you know about them. You\u2019re 100 percent there, and you\u2019re 100 percent listening to them, and your questions are 100 percent coming based on curiosity about what they are telling you and nothing else. And why it is that I think Humans of New York is special and I think Humans of New York is something that is precious and maybe difficult to replicate is that I\u2019ve spent seven years in these conversations with 10,000 people. And it\u2019s not necessarily that I have gotten so good at asking questions. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve gotten so comfortable in the presence of a stranger and so comfortable in the presence of somebody that I just met that I can sit there with them without an ounce of self-consciousness and just be and just be there with them and listen to them and be curious about them. And there\u2019s this energy that happens there, that this doesn\u2019t feel like somebody that\u2019s interviewing you. It feels like somebody who knows you and cares about, is really interested in what\u2019s going on in your life. And It\u2019s very subtle and hard to describe, but I think it\u2019s that energy and that presence and that being there. And it\u2019s something I had to earn. It\u2019s the same thing like public speaking. When do you really get good at public speaking? It\u2019s when you\u2019ve done it so much that you can be yourself on the stage. And there is only one way to get there. And that\u2019s to be on stage, scared as shit, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. And I think the only way to get to that place where you can have that rapport with a stranger is not by studying interview techniques. It\u2019s by sitting with thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of strangers until nothing feels strange about it anymore and you\u2019re able to be in that calm, present place. And what happens is your interview transfers to the other person, and they get to that place too. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If we were to pick up the example that you gave just a few minutes ago about this woman talking about her relationship with her husband and his depression and alcoholism and so on, if you remember, how did you end up there? In other words, do you recall how the conversation headed to that point? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Oh, yeah. Well, let me give you another example since I already \u2013 let me give you an example of somebody I talked to in the Philippines a few weeks ago. Same thing. I\u2019ve traveled to 30 different countries now. I\u2019ve done the exact same work. I\u2019ve been to Pakistan. I\u2019ve been to Iran. I\u2019ve been to Iraq. And I work with interpreters. And the process is exactly the same. I just walk up to random people and get into these conversations with them. There was a woman in a park in the Philippines. And I started asking her \u2013 I think one of the first questions I asked her was, \u201cWhat is your biggest goal in life?\u201d And she said she wanted to have a good family life. And so, I thought that that was the story, and I started asking about that. And I learned that she wanted to have a good family life because when she was young, her family split. And she was forced to go to the courthouse with her mom and her dad at the age of nine. And a judge made her choose which parent she wanted to go with. And so, I thought that was the story. And so, I started asking questions about that. And then I learned that she ended up going with her mom. And afterwards, her mom remarried, and she didn\u2019t like her new stepfather, so she ran away. And I thought that that was the story. So, I started asking questions about that. And then I found out that the reason she ran away was because her stepfather was abusing her and that she had never told a person in her life, including her mom until that moment that that had happened. And that\u2019s how we end up in those places is I am just curious about what\u2019s going on in there. I\u2019m just curious about what happened. I want to know the story. And I just ask, and I ask, and I ask. And if something\u2019s not quite making sense, I wanna know why. And so, I ask more, and I ask more. Somebody can choose eventually to not tell the truth by saying, \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable with it,\u201d but it can\u2019t really be concealed if somebody is really, really, really, really curious. You know what I mean? You can never get to the point \u2013 Humans of New York interviews don\u2019t work, I always say it\u2019s not because somebody doesn\u2019t have an interesting story. Humans of New York interviews don\u2019t work when I reach a place when somebody\u2019s uncomfortable with the process which is absolutely fine. That\u2019s completely understandable. I\u2019m a random person. I\u2019m sharing these stories with 20 million people. It\u2019s 100 percent fine if you don\u2019t wanna share. That is nothing against you at all. But those are the interviews that don\u2019t make it on the blog. It\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t interesting. It\u2019s that Humans of New York really thrives on this kind of honesty. And if somebody\u2019s willing to be honest, everybody\u2019s got an interesting story. And so, it\u2019s like the \u2013 I hit dead ends not because somebody is boring. It\u2019s because somebody isn\u2019t comfortable with disclosing. And so, that\u2019s what defines the Humans of New York interview or what is usable of the Humans of New York interview. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How often when they do go there and disclose these very vulnerable stories or things they\u2019ve never told anyone else, how often do they ask that you not use it or express concern that it\u2019s gonna cause some type of problem for them? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, that\u2019s one thing that I am very principled about. I give the person agency every step of the way. I tell them, \u201cAnything you don\u2019t wanna an \u2013\u201d first of all, they don\u2019t have to talk to me. They have that decision. Once we start talking, I say, \u201cAny question you don\u2019t wanna answer, you don\u2019t have to answer. If you tell me something during the course of this interview and you change your mind afterwards and don\u2019t want me to share it, that\u2019s fine. At the end of the interview, if you would like me to photograph your hands or your feet instead of your face, we can do that.\u201d In fact, if it\u2019s a very vulnerable story, I will normally insist on that to protect the person or protect somebody that they\u2019re talking about. \u201cIf after I\u2019ve done the interview and before it\u2019s posted, at any time you change your mind and you don\u2019t want me to share it,\u201d I give them my email address. \u201cAnd after the photo is up for any reason at any time, if you become uncomfortable from all the attention and would like me to take the story down, I immediately will.\u201d And so, people have control of it every step of the way. It\u2019s very important to me that nobody ever sees Humans of New York as something that was done to them. I always want it to be seen as something that was done with them. And have I failed at that sometimes? Out of the 10,000 people have I interviewed, have there been people who didn\u2019t expect me to share a certain part of their story or were surprised by it or it was a negative experience for? There have been a handful. But I can only say that those are the worst moments for me when Humans of New York was a negative experience for somebody because that\u2019s who I really care about is the people that are on the blog because they\u2019re the people who I had that moment with. I spent an hour and a half with them, and we got to that place. If they are hurt by it, especially if they were really vulnerable, that\u2019s when I feel the worst about myself because I know how much pressure that spotlight can be. And I know how difficult it can be having 20 million people look at you. And so, if I ever feel that I maybe accidentally mispresented it, that\u2019s when I feel the worst. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do you think about money as it relates to Humans of New York? Ostensibly, you want to probably eat more than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and eggs now. At the same \u2013 Brandon Stanton:\u00a0And I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 yeah. Go ahead. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No, I was just gonna say in terms of what you do with advertising or partnerships or projects, because you have also such sensitive \u2013 not always but you have such potentially sensitive subject matter. And it\u2019s so personalized for these folks in many cases. How do you think about that? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Right. So, Humans of New York, I think we\u2019ve sold a million and a half books. The television show, Facebook. And Facebook, there\u2019s more than one person interested in it. And Facebook, they compensated me well for the four years of work that I worked on the television series. So, I\u2019m very comfortable right now. Humans of New York has made me a \u2013 let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not worrying about peanut butter and sandwiches. I\u2019m very comfortable. With that being said, I will say that Humans of New York has raised \u2013 I\u2019ve made a fraction of the money with Humans of New York that we have raised for charity, a small fraction of the money that we\u2019ve raised for charity. I\u2019ve turned down maybe more money than I\u2019ve made from people who want to use my brand to partner with their brand. Big brands have offered me a lot of money to do \u201cHumans of\u2026\u201d and I\u2019m just gonna make up some names. You know what I mean? Like, \u201cHumans of Merecdes-Benz,\u201d Humans of China, sponsored by Virgin Airlines.\u201d These are all fake things that I\u2019m making up right now but resembled offers that have been made to me. Where I make the dividing line is that I\u2019m willing to make money as Brandon Stanton. A big part of my income comes from speeches. I give about ten of these a year. And that is a big part of my income. I sell books as Brandon Stanton. I don\u2019t sell the name Humans of New York to anyone. I don\u2019t rent my brand to anyone because I never want any piece of content that I share to have a single motive. I\u2019ve never broken that seal. And it\u2019s been so tempting, but I just know if I break it once, I\u2019m never going to get it back. So, for seven years, I\u2019ve never been compensated for a piece of content that I\u2019ve posted on my blog. And that is the main delineation that I make between what can be monetized and what can\u2019t. And because of that, like I said, I\u2019m not worrying about peanut butter and sandwiches anymore. But there is a little bit of an insecurity. Am I gonna look back in 40 years if everything suddenly goes away, and Facebook and Instagram, nobody are using anymore, am I gonna be like, \u201cOh, man. I\u2019m working the nightshift now. And I had 20 million followers 20 years ago. Maybe I should have tried a little harder to make some money\u2019? But that\u2019s how I view it now. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Should have done those Humans of New York lunchboxes while I had the chance. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0There you go. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, you mentioned the book. I\u2019d like to chat about that for a second because it\u2019s been the \u2013 well, books at this point, certainly. But at least as I understand it, the first book sold millions of copies, certainly more than a million. Was it easy to find a publisher for that first book? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0No. I barely did. Macmillan, God bless them. So, at the time, I think when I sold the book, I had a few hundred thousand Facebook fans. And it was growing so fast. There was so much energy. Things were really taking off. And I just thought, \u201cOh, my Gosh. Everybody\u2019s gonna wanna publish this book.\u201d And there\u2019s six big publishers. I\u2019m sure you know all this. Or seven or something like that. And the goal is to get all of them interested. And then in the perfect world, all of them are interested, and then they bid against each other. And so, only three of them would meet with me, or four of them maybe. And during those meetings, I thought that I killed it. I thought, \u201cOh, man. Oh. I described it so well. I presented so well. They\u2019re all gonna be very interested.\u201d And so, we had an auction. And the bids were due by 12:00 noon on one day. And at 11:00, I hadn\u2019t heard anything from my agent. And I was just like, \u201cWell, what\u2019s going on?\u201d So, I texted him. And he goes, \u201cOh, the first three dropped out. They didn\u2019t make an offer. There\u2019s still one that we haven\u2019t heard from yet.\u201d And I\u2019m just like, \u201cOh, my God,\u201d because well, that book was my life raft because I didn\u2019t have any money at that time. I was hoping to get a little bit of a book deal so I could pay my bills. And I just remember I went to the YMCA, and I just ran five miles because I thought it was gonna be the worst day of my life. And then when I got on the treadmill, I found out that Macmillan had made a small but respectable offer. And that\u2019s how I got a book deal by the skin of my teeth which was lucrative for all parties involved. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And what were some of the reasons for not meeting with you or not putting in an offer that they gave? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Because there\u2019s two types of books that have a history of not selling well. Well, there are a lot of types. But mine fit two categories. It was a photography book. Photography books don\u2019t sell based on conventional wisdom. And it was what they viewed as a regional book where it is a photography book centered on a single city. Therefore, nobody\u2019s going to want it. That was the argument against publishing Humans of New York. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oops. Yeah. I love these stories because they are the rule and not the exception for so many things that turn into something. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Well, things that are not derivative. You know what I mean? In my mind, the most valuable idea is the one that nobody\u2019s ever seen before. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve got the gold. But you\u2019ve got a better chance of just choosing something else that\u2019s good and making something derivative on it because then when you go into these places and you pitch, you can say, \u201cOh, this is 50 Shades of Gray, but with furries.\u201d I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s funny that for me, as an artist and as a creator, the last thing I ever want to do is be describing my work as, \u201cIt\u2019s this but with a twist.\u201d You know what I mean? I wanna be creating something new. However, in the marketplace, the things that have most likely chance of getting bought are things that people can peg to other past successes. And so, when you walk in with something like what I thought was Humans of New York\u2019s greatest value which was there really wasn\u2019t anything else like it at the time, they viewed as its biggest detriment. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. \u201cBut what are the comparables?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. There aren\u2019t any comparables.\u201d Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yeah, right? Comparables. That fucking word. Are you kidding me? And the same thing when I was making the television series. The same thing. As an artist, I want this to be like nothing else that\u2019s been cre \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing I care about is making something that\u2019s really unlike anything else. If it\u2019s like something else, I don\u2019t really want to obsess over it for three years trying to make it. My goal is to make something new and something fresh. And when you\u2019re trying to get compensated for your work, the thing that you care about the most as an artist is often the thing that\u2019s held against you the most because people are risk averse, and they want to see something comparable that has also done well. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s next for you? Do you have five-year plans, three-year plans, and so on at this point? Or is it still 24 hours by 24 hours? What\u2019s next for you? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0I do. I\u2019m having a baby. So, that\u2019s gonna be new. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Congratulations. That\u2019s a big deal. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Thank you. Having a baby in July. So, beyond that which is going to be new \u2013 for me, right now, the biggest kind of artistic tension is knowing \u2013 because of my experience on social media the past seven years, knowing how social media works, knowing the importance of output and content and daily content and engagement and things like that, knowing how to build an audience on one hand and wanting to push myself as an artist on the other hand. And what I really wanna do as an artist I wanna withdraw from the daily output model. I wanna work on things that have longer timeframes, that are more polished, that are maybe longer but take longer to produce and more resources. But in order to do that, that requires me to pull back from the blog which the golden rule of social media is keep engaging with your audience. Keep connecting with your audience. Don\u2019t lose touch. Don\u2019t lose touch. Don\u2019t lose touch. But the artist in me wants to go disappear for a while and go into a dark cave and come out with something. So, I think that is the main push and pull in my mind right now. So, I\u2019m gonna be going to the Philippines next month to work on \u2013 I\u2019m gonna spend a month filming a documentary on somebody because I love documentaries, and I wanna make a documentary that is very interesting. So, that might not be what\u2019s best for business or best for growing audience or best by social media metrics. But that is what is exciting to me. And it all comes back to that moment. It\u2019s so funny. And I think you\u2019re probably the same way is that we have these mantras and these things that we\u2019ve learned that we stand on stage and we say and we think about. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the perfect idea. It\u2019s never gonna seem perfect. You just gotta go after it.\u201d \u201cChoose what is nourishing in the moment,\u201d things like that. And if you\u2019re like me, I have to preach to myself a lot and tell myself the same thing that I\u2019m telling other people because it\u2019s so easy to fall back into what everybody else is struggling with as well because you never truly escape it. And so, one of the things that I do is I go back to that moment when I lost my job and I was walking in Chicago, and I asked myself, \u201cIf nothing mattered but how I was spending my time, what would I be doing? What would be most nourishing for me in any given moment if nothing else mattered except for how I spent my time?\u201d And I\u2019m trying to remind myself of that, the same thing I tell other people. And right now, I wanna go to the Philippines, and I wanna make a documentary. And it might not be best for business. And it might not be best for Humans of New York, but it\u2019s what Brandon wants to do. And so, that is the North Star that I\u2019m trying to follow. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Good for you, man. I\u2019m excited for you to disappear for a little while. That may come off the wrong way, but I think you get the sentiment behind it. And I have a random suggestion which is if you have not read Cryptonomicon which is a book by Neal Stephenson who also wrote Snow Crash \u2013 Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Oh, I love Snow Crash. I love Snow Crash. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, Cryptonomicon, part of the through line, one of the narratives takes place in the Philippines. So, that could be fun to pick up. But Brandon, thank you so much for taking the time today. This was really a wonderful experience for me. And thank you for being vulnerable also and filling in some of the color in the story of your life thus far. It\u2019s been really nice to get to know you a little better in this conversation. Brandon Stanton:\u00a0Yeah. Well, thank you so much. Hope some of that\u2019s usable. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. I think it is. Is there anything else you would like to ask of people, suggest to people? Any closing comments before we wrap up? Brandon Stanton:\u00a0No, I think that\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0All right. Awesome. Well, once again, really appreciate you making the time, particularly to how much you think about how you spend your time, to chat with me and with everybody today. And for everyone listening, you can, as always find links to everything that we have spoken about, to all of Brandon\u2019s projects as well in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast. And until next time, do what is nourishing for you in the moment, or at least ponder the question. And thanks for listening. Hey, guys. This is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off.

trying to think about this big thing that i was going to accomplish in life and started just focusing on putting one foot in front of the other every single day, it began to propel me on the journey

when i wasn\u2019t going to class", "i flunked out", "and then when i decided to go back to college, i thought to myself, \u201cwell, i\u2019m just going to study something that i enjoy anyway, so it\u2019s not this major force of effort to go to class and to do my work.\u201d at that time, i had developed a reading habit", "that was really when my life turned around because remember, i stopped thinking about these big problems i wanted to solve, and i started focusing on establishing a routine and some discipline in my life", "and one of the first big ones and still probably the most monumental routine that i ever established and decision i ever made was that i was going to read 100 pages a day, mostly nonfiction", "and whether the book was the little prince, or it was something like, the wealth of nations, whether it took me an hour or whether it took me eight hours, every single day, i was going to read 100 pages", "and i did that for years", "even when i went back to school, in addition to my schoolwork, i would read 100 pages", "tim ferriss:\u00a0sorry to interrupt, but what catalyzed that decisions", "was there \u2013 brandon stanton:\u00a0psychologically, it was this feeling of being maybe behind", "one of the very first books that i read was this autobiography of ben franklin", "and he has all these \u2013 he did the poor richard\u2019s almanac, and he has all these sayings", "and i remember first of all, ben franklin himself was kind of the pioneer in getting self-improvement down to a science", "you know what i mean", "so, his example, first of all, of how much effort he put into improving himself and moving himself forward", "and then i remember he had this one quote that uneducated genius is like finding silver in the mine", "and it made me think that i had spent all of this time thinking and pondering, and i thought that school was beneath me and school was boring", "and because of that, i really hadn\u2019t been imbibing much information", "and at that time, something flipped", "and i felt like i\u2019ve missed out on probably the last four or six years of education because i was just doing the minimum", "i was just getting by and writing my papers before class", "i was probably looking at the person\u2019s next to me paper a few times", "so, even though i was making okay grades, i really wasn\u2019t taking in a lot of information and educating myself", "and so, i think that at that time, i decided i was going to become extremely educated", "and i did", "i did become an extremely educated person", "but 95 percent of that education was outside of school", "95 percent of that education was over the course of seven or eight years saying i\u2019m going to read 100 pages of nonfiction a day, every single day", "and i did it for seven or eight years", "i\u2019d say 60 percent of that was biography", "i would say another 20 percent of it was history", "and i would read fiction too when i was absolutely tired of eating my vegetables", "that\u2019s what i would call the most boring books, the really conceptual ones i just viewed as vegetables", "it was sometimes hard to get through", "tim ferriss:\u00a0the fiber of knowledge", "brandon stanton:\u00a0yeah", "but it grows", "and it develops you", "but yeah", "so, biographies were the ones that i was really, really drawn to", "and so, at the time, i started reading all these biographies", "and i was loving it", "and biography is just history", "biography is the best form of history if you ask me because it cuts through the theory, it cuts through all the speculation of the author, and we get d own to the nuts and the bolts of the decisions that people made in their lives", "and i think that is the purest form of education that you can get", "and it is the advice that i give people who don\u2019t know what they wanna do with their lives", "pick somebody that you admire and read their biography", "read their biography", "if you really want some sort of guidance in your life, pick somebody who\u2019s done things that you want to do and that you really admire and read a nice, fat, 800-page biography of their lives", "find out the struggles they went through", "find out the twists and turns of their lives and the decisions they made", "and i don\u2019t think there\u2019s any better actionable road map, actionable education than getting down in the granular level of somebody\u2019s life and finding out how they navigated it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if someone wanted to \u2013 let\u2019s just say that they are having a lapse of concentration and can\u2019t think of people they admire who have biographies, if you were to recommend any one to three biographies as gateway drugs into that world, are there any that come to mind", "brandon stanton:\u00a0it depends upon what you wanna accomplish in life", "if you\u2019re just flagging, and you don\u2019t know what you wanna do, start with ben franklin", "start with somebody who is very disciplined and programmatic in figuring out how to develop themselves", "again, my advice always to people who are stuck is quit looking at the big picture", "people get stuck because they wanna accomplish too big of things and they don\u2019t know the right step to take", "so, i always say instead of focusing on the year, instead of focusing on the arc of your life, focus on the 24-hour period", "and nobody mastered the 24-hour period more than benjamin franklin", "so, if you have no idea what you wanna do, start there, i would say", "if you know what you wanna do, you gotta pick the person that you admire the most", "do you want to participate in social movements", "pick martin luther king", "do you wanna be president of the united states", "if you wanna be president of the united states, i would recommend lyndon johnson", "lyndon johnson because he was probably the president that was given the least in his life except for maybe abraham lincoln", "he didn\u2019t go to ivy league", "he wasn\u2019t necessarily a great looking guy", "he went to san marcos teacher college", "and again, this is if you wanna be president", "i don\u2019t wanna be president", "he worked his way up through understanding how the levers of democracy work, the levers of power and our government work", "and so, he is a fascinating character sketch on how to be president", "if you wanna read a lyndon johnson biography, you should read the four-volume biography by robert caro which is the best of those", "but other than that, it all depends upon what it is that you wanna do in life", "there\u2019s just no biography that every person should read", "they should pick the person that they admire the most and read the biography of their life", "tim ferriss:\u00a0with ben franklin, would it be a biography like walter isaacson", "or would you \u2013 brandon stanton:\u00a0the isaacson one was the one i read", "and that stands out the most because it was the first", "the person that i\u2019ve read the most biographies on, probably theodore roosevelt just because his life is so fascinating", "probably adolf hitler", "probably stalin", "and it\u2019s not because in any way these people are admirable", "but as a history major, to me, it wasn\u2019t the individual themseelf that was fascinating", "to me, it was how does a group of people \u2013 germany was a smart, industrialized country", "to me, the big, philosophical question that fascinated me and the reason that i delved so much into the lives and the practices of the dictators is how is it that a group of such educated, smart, well-meaning people were able to be organized under the premise of committing such evil", "and that, to me, has always fascinated me because i believe that people are inherently good", "and i\u2019ve traveled to 30 or 40 different countries", "and it\u2019s funny", "every place has a reputation", "\u201coh, don\u2019t go to this city", "people won\u2019t talk to you.\u201d so many times when i land in a place, they say, \u201cthis isn\u2019t gonna work here", "people aren\u2019t open here", "people aren\u2019t friendly here.\u201d and i find one on one, people all over the world are very \u2013 they share a similar soul, i guess", "and if people are generally the same everywhere, then that means anywhere, something like this could happen", "anywhere, people can get pulled into this crowd psychology and direct their anger and their hatred and violence towards people in a way that would contradict their morals if you met them one on one", "and because of that, the lives and the periods of history that have always been most intellectually interesting to me \u2013 again, it\u2019s not something i admire", "it\u2019s not something i\u2019m looking to duplicate of course \u2013 have been these periods where a very driven, ideological, individual has managed to mobilize a group of people towards ends that looking back from a historical perspective were brutal and violent and absolutely unexplainable", "and i think it\u2019s important to understand these things to keep it from happening again", "do you remember you asked about bond trading like \u2013", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, i do", "oh, no", "brandon stanton:\u00a0 \u2013 two questions ago", "i never even talked about it", "well, the whole reason i think i started talking about history is because bond trading was really an anomaly in my life", "i was really wrapped up in all these things that we\u2019re talking about now", "i was really wrapped up in history and biography, mainly", "when obama, he was \u2013 god, what was it", "2008, 2007", "i think it was 2007", "he was in the primary", "and i really became fixated on this campaign", "and i was going to knock on doors and \u2013 this was during the primary when he was going up against hillary", "and i was knocking on doors", "i was going to different states, knocking on doors", "and i was reading every article about the delegate system and super delegates", "and there was this point where i was just absolutely positive he was going to win", "this is the primary", "i was just absolutely positive he was going to win", "and i was broke at the time", "this is not something i would ever do today", "but i took out $5,000.00 in student loans, and i actually bet on barak obama would win the presidency", "tim ferriss:\u00a0where does one bet on something like that", "brandon stanton:\u00a0back then it was an irish exchange", "it has since gone under", "it was called in-trade", "and i think they had him at like, 40 percent chance to win at that time", "and he had a 70 percent chance of [inaudible] [00:29:27] or something", "and so, i didn\u2019t make a ton of money off of it because it took me a week to wire my money to ireland", "and in the time that i was wiring my money, he had won a couple more times", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, the odds changed", "brandon stanton:\u00a0exactly", "and so, i ended up only ma \u2013 i made like, $1,000.00, $1,200.00, which for me, as a college student, was all the money in the world", "but more fatefully, i was telling that story just like i\u2019m telling it to you to a friend of mine who worked in chicago", "and he was a trader", "he was a bond trader", "and i was telling him that story", "and he told me, \u201cthe one differentiator between successful traders and unsuccessful traders in our office is their comfort with risk taking", "and based on that story, i would like you to talk to my boss.\u201d and so \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0based on the extreme prudency you\u2019ve demonstrated with that story", "well, yeah", "i think it was the comfort with risk taking", "and so, at that time, i didn\u2019t know what i wanted to do again", "i just studied history because i enjoyed it", "i really enjoyed it", "and so, he got me an interview with his boss", "and it was scheduled", "and this is somebody who went to an ivy league school and he had studied finance his entire life, and he had gotten this job", "so, i thought this was an opportunity i would not have any other way", "and i wasn\u2019t sure what i wanted to do at the time", "i was a history major", "and so, i had a month to prepare", "so, i read about 20 books on the market", "and then i went into the interview", "and at that time, i was very well versed on how markets worked", "and that\u2019s how i got that job", "tim ferriss:\u00a0good thing you had all that reading practice", "brandon stanton:\u00a0yo", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what was your first week as a bond trader like", "brandon stanton:\u00a0see, this is the \u2013 and i always try to say when i \u2013 if somebody\u2019s just listened to this interview up until this point, i think we talk about bond trading and dictators which really has nothing to do with my life now", "and i think the narrative that people in interviews always try to put on me is that \u2013 because it\u2019s a fun narrative \u2013 oh, chasing the money, doing this soul-sucking finance job and then cut the rope behind him to pursue his true passion which was taking photographs and art", "and there\u2019s a kernel of truth there", "but the real story is that markets were fascinating to me", "i\u2019m still fascinated by markets", "they seem so tangible when you\u2019re watching cnbc and you\u2019re seeing these numbers", "and it seems all so mathematical", "but in reality, markets are nothing but a bunch of people arguing over what something\u2019s worth", "if you remove the computer and go back 50 years, a market is a crowd of people haggling over what something that is impossible to value is worth", "and the number that comes out of it is really based on psychology", "and it\u2019s based on this back and forth over what these numbers mean", "and that was always so interesting to me", "and it remains very interesting to me", "so, i was philosophically very interested in markets", "and i was fascinated by bond trading", "and i was obsessed with it, to be honest, for two years", "and it was a type of bond trading where you\u2019re very highly leveraged", "and so, it was a type where there was just huge gains or huge losses every single night", "i compare it to playing a very high stakes game of poker every single night", "and so, it was extremely \u2013 i don\u2019t think i could do it today", "i was in my early 20s at the time", "there was just adrenaline pumping through my body at all times", "when you take something that you\u2019re naturally philosophically interested in and you pair it with a large amount of money and a large amount of excitement, it creates this fixation", "it\u2019s almost like crack where it\u2019s just all you can think about at any given time", "and when i go to colleges and i give speeches on the path of humans of new york and what led me to pursue this life that was outside of books and outside of computer screens was that after the end of two years, when i lost my job, i looked back at the time that i had spent that two years", "and it wasn\u2019t the physical time that was lost that was most concerning to me", "it was that i had spent two years using all of my intellect and all of my creative energy trying to figure out how to be the most effective relative value trader and fixed income securities in the asian markets", "it was just something that was so narrow and so myopic", "and i couldn\u2019t even talk with my friends about it", "and at the end of two years, we\u2019d gone through the financial crisis", "i\u2019d lost everything i\u2019d ever made", "when i lost that job \u2013 it was a very lucrative job potentially", "but when i lost that job, i was broke because i\u2019d lost everything", "tim ferriss:\u00a0why did you lose the job", "what happened", "brandon stanton:\u00a0well, it depends upon how much personal responsibility i wanna take", "i think the narrative that\u2019s most protective of the ego is that we had a type of trading that was calibrated to work during periods of low volatility", "the years from i guess 1995 or whatever \u2013 i don\u2019t know when my math is right but late \u201890s to 2008 were periods of historically low volatility where the type of trading that we were doing worked", "and when the financial crisis hit in 2008, volatility went through the roof", "long story short, the type of trading that we were doing stopped working", "and the company that had been around for over a decade was out of business about a year after i left", "so, that\u2019s the way of explaining that avoids the most personal responsibility", "if i was to explain it in the way that makes myself the most personally responsible, markets changed, and i wasn\u2019t adaptive enough to figure it out", "i kept banging my head against the same things that used to be working", "i refused to fully embrace the fact that what worked for me extremely well for a year had stopped working", "and because of that, the risk calculations had changed", "and instead of making a lot of money every night, i was losing a lot of money every night", "and i eventually got to the point where i was no longer a productive member of the firm", "and so, yeah", "it depends up on which story you wanna tell", "i think the truth is probably somewhere in between the two", "but regardless, i ended up without a job", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, thank you for sharing both versions of that", "no, i think that that also reflects a level of \u2013 this may not be the right word but objectivity or ability to detach and observe that has always fascinated me about you, quite frankly, which certainly translates i think in a very empathic way later", "and we\u2019ll get to that", "but i wanna talk about the finance world and markets for just a second because, as you noted, it\u2019s very tempting for someone who\u2019s trying to weave a narrative of your life into this soul-sucking period, sees the light, cuts the tether, burns the ships, off into the arts and true passion", "but the markets, as you noted, are really fascinating", "and i was chatting with someone i\u2019ve just gotten to know actually in the last few weeks", "i suppose you could call him a wealth manager", "but 75 percent of what he does is invest in bonds", "he probably wouldn\u2019t call it trading, but in effect, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing", "and he said something to me that has stuck in my mind for a while now which is, \u201ci learn more in the first two to four hours of sitting down and talking to someone about money than their therapists have probably learned over the last two to four years.\u201d and getting to see how people respond to money and loss aversion and the possibility of making money is in and of itself fascinating", "then you add in thousands and millions of market participants, it gets even more interesting", "and then, at least in my limited experience, when i read something \u2013 my exposure to bonds is very limited", "but when you read something like liar\u2019s poker by michael lewis which i think is a fantastic book \u2013 and the part that stuck out to me where i was like, \u201cokay", "i need to be very careful about playing this game because i\u2019ll get my face ripped off,\u201d is there\u2019s some part \u2013 and i\u2019m gonna get all the details wrong \u2013 but there\u2019s some guy who\u2019s nicknamed fat tony", "and he\u2019s a big wig at solomon brothers", "and he bets his buddies that the markets for whatever, aa bonds and x, y, and z are going up", "and he bets them", "and it\u2019s this dick measuring contest", "and he puts $50 million into the market, and it goes down", "and so, his friends are busting his balls", "and then they\u2019re like, \u201coh, market\u2019s going up, huh?\u201d and so, instead of putting $50 million in, he\u2019s like, \u201cfuck it.\u201d and he puts $500 million in", "and all the other market participants panic thinking that he has information they don\u2019t", "and so, the market goes up", "and he says, \u201csee", "i told you the market was going up.\u201d and i was like, \u201coh, my god", "this is not nearly as clean as the textbooks would want you to believe.\u201d brandon stanton:\u00a0well, as somebody who\u2019s interviewed 10,000 people, i would say that talking with somebody about their money and how they choose to use their money will give you an insight into a very limited \u2013 and i mean, maybe i\u2019m wrong \u2013 but a very limited aspect of their personality which is their comfort with risk", "and i think our approach to money and our approach to trading and our approach to markets are very much driven by our animal spirits, greed and fear and things like that", "but i feel that there is a huge portion of people\u2019s lives and thought lives that are separate and isolated from those drives, those very primal drives of wanting more and being afraid to lose", "that\u2019s really what drives the markets is the greed and the fear", "and i think talking with somebody about those two drives and where their greed comes from and where their fear comes from, it\u2019ll give you some insight", "but to me, the markets, they can only tell you so much", "and they can only \u2013 it\u2019s a part of human existence, the drives that control a market", "but there\u2019s so much that people care about outside of that", "and i think that was what was so dangerous about just being a trader is that you\u2019re burying so much of your thought energy into just the desire for more and the fear of losing", "you know what i mean", "the kind of narrow animalistic drives that push a market up and down, and you\u2019re tethering yourself to that", "and you just miss out on so much of the life that\u2019s going on around you", "and this is me", "this is me", "i think it\u2019s part of my personality that once i dive into something, i do it to the exclusion of almost everything else", "one of the reasons humans of new york ended up becoming so successful, i did know some of \u2013 it\u2019s more the exception than the rule", "there are people who are so in control of their emotions or maybe they don\u2019t have the same emotional range as other people that are able to turn off their computer every single day, go home, and not think about the markets and completely leave them there", "but for me, it was something that was all-consuming for me", "and when i made the decision to pursue something more artistic was when i had lost my job", "and i was looking back at the two years of my life", "and i was thinking, \u201cgod.\u201d and after i lost my job, i was so scared of that day", "during the two years when i was obsessing over markets and then things started going back, there was nothing i was more afraid of than losing that job", "and then on the day that it happened, it was surprisingly a good day because i remember taking a walk that day", "and i started asking myself things like, \u201cwhat do i wanna do", "what do i wanna do", "if i could do anything with my time, what would i do?\u201d and i had been for two years so focused on keeping that job that i didn\u2019t have room in my brain to ask myself any other questions", "and so, at that moment, i decided i\u2019ve lost these two years of not only my time, but more importantly, i\u2019ve lost two years of my thoughts focusing on this game for making money which was fascinating and philosophically interesting", "but when you boil it down, it\u2019s a game", "and i said, \u201ci\u2019m gonna spend the next foreseeable future instead of spending my time trying to make money, i\u2019m gonna try to make just enough money to where i can control my time and just do something that i enjoy doing for no other reason than it is nourishing in the moment, not that at the end of the day i\u2019m gonna have a profit but because it\u2019s nourishing in the moment.\u201d and at that time, it was photography", "and the whole reason i think one of the neatest things about humans of new york is that over the past eight years, humans of new york has become largely the most followed photography project in the world with i think 25 million on social media now", "and it\u2019s eight years old", "and i think one of the coolest things is i just started photographing about eight years ago", "i started taking photos during this time that i\u2019m talking to you about", "and the whole reason i started taking photos was because i was trying to create some space in my mind away from work", "i was desperate for something to do on the weekends that would give me this foothold in my brain where i had a sense of purpose and a sense of identity outside how the markets were doing every single day", "and so, i bought this camera", "i started going to downtown chicago and photographing just everything", "and i loved it", "and not long after, i lost my job", "and i made the decision that i was gonna be a photographer not because i was very skilled at it at the time, not because i thought it was an angle towards success, and not because i thought it was an angle towards an audience", "it was that i just loved doing it in the moment", "it was nourishing in the moment", "and so, i found this thing that was nourishing in the moment that i enjoyed doing", "and i said, \u201ci\u2019m going to try to structure my life around creating as much time for this as possible", "i want to make just enough money to where i can pay my rent, eat, and photograph all day long.\u201d and the journey that ended up creating humans of new york was my attempt to create that space in my life and that space in my head to focus on something that was very nourishing in the moment", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did you cover your expenses in the very early days of that experience", "brandon stanton:\u00a0this was 2008", "we had i believe a record amount of time that you could get unemployment", "and i had just lost my job", "and so, i got $620.00 i think every two weeks from the government because i was unemployed, and i had worked for two years", "so, that was enough to basically just pay my rent in a sublease that i found on craigslist in bedford-stuyvesant, brooklyn that was enough to pay that and maybe have peanut butter jelly sandwiches and eggs, assuming that you needed no other expenses, that you wore the same clothes and the same shoes", "that was enough for me to just eat, sleep, and photograph all day long", "and once i got to have a decent level of skill, and i mean just a passable level of skill, if anybody would pay me to take portraits for them, i would do that", "somebody hired me to do their wedding", "and i didn\u2019t spend money on anything", "all i did was photograph all day long because i knew that i was making this pivot in my life to where i was going after a lucrative career towards i was going toward just wanting to spend my time doing something all day long", "and i became obsessed with photography in the same way that i was obsessed with markets", "i loved it", "i just loved it", "it was like a treasure hunt, just going out", "and it was so different than trading too", "i\u2019m outside", "i\u2019m interacting with the world", "i\u2019m having conversations", "i\u2019m having these little adventures and discovering these new things", "and i was just hooked on it", "and i was just obsessed with it", "and i knew i was making a lot of sacrifices to be doing this in my life, so i didn\u2019t do anything else", "i didn\u2019t go to concerts", "i didn\u2019t go out to restaurants", "i didn\u2019t spend much time with friends because i didn\u2019t really know anybody in new york", "that\u2019s another crazy detail about humans of new york is that humans of new york is an eight-year-old photography project based on people in new york city", "i took my first photograph eight years ago", "and i went to new york for the very first time in my life eight years ago", "so, it was all just very new and all very driven by the desire to photograph all day long", "tim ferriss:\u00a0was the move to new york related to the desire to take photographs", "or was it something else", "brandon stanton:\u00a0so, what i did is \u2013 so, i got fired, and i started \u2013 my goal was i wanna find out how to be a photographer", "i love photography", "how am i gonna create a life where i can support myself and photograph all day long", "so, i was just outdoing it every single day", "and then i started \u2013 along with the graffiti and along with the architectural shots and along with the nature shots, i started photographing people", "and i noticed that out of everything i was photographing, the photographs of people were the most unique", "they\u2019re the ones that least resembled everything else i was seeing being put on facebook and stuff like that", "and so, i decided to focus on that", "and then, while focusing on that, i started stopping people on the street and asking for their photo and taking a portrait of them", "and because of that extra layer of difficulty of having to approach a stranger, the portraits that i was taking of people were more different than the candid photos i was taking of people", "and so, i started focusing solely on that", "and that\u2019s when i started having an idea that even though i hadn\u2019t been photographing so long, i was heading in a direction that was pretty unique because i was stopping random people on the streets in a very \u2013 i know some people will do series, but i was doing this every single day", "and i was getting quite a collection", "and this seemed like a fresh type of photography", "so, it\u2019s all i did", "and then i started traveling to different cities", "i went to philadelphia just stopping people", "then i went to new orleans", "i went back to atlanta and did this", "and then i traveled to new york", "and when i got to new york and i was stopping people and asking for their photographs, i realized that new york, if you were going to try to do this type of photography was the best place to be", "mainly just practical reasons that you don\u2019t need a car in new york", "i didn\u2019t have a car, and i couldn\u2019t afford a car", "you can just ride the subway everywhere", "you can walk everywhere", "and there are so many people", "there are so many people", "i remember coming out of the lincoln tunnel the very first time, and i couldn\u2019t even see the sidewalk because it was rush hour", "and there were so many people", "and i thought, \u201cif i\u2019m going to do this type of photography, this is the place to do it.\u201d and i wasn\u2019t doing any interviews at this time", "and that\u2019s the thing", "the humans of new york that i moved to new york to do looks nothing like the humans of new york that later became successful", "it was really just the impetus to get me on the ground working every day to figure it out along the way", "my very first idea for humans of new york was i was going to photograph 10,000 people in new york city across all five boroughs, and i was gonna plot their photo on a map", "that was my idea of how i was going to make a life out of being a photographer", "i was gonna be the guy who did that", "and that was what got me on the ground, got me out on the street every single day approaching hundreds and thousands of people and put me in the situation where i could innovate and i could start having conversations with these people which turned into questions i was asking them which turned into eventually, seven years later, the 90-minute to an hour and a half long very probing and therapeutic and psychological interviews that i have with random strangers every single day", "the result of which and the output of which became the stories that i think people are so connected with and the stories that really make humans of new york humans of new york", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how are you getting better at photography during this first, let\u2019s just call it six-month period since you certainly seem from all indications to be someone who goes for total immersion whether it\u2019s reading 10 to 20 books on the markets before an interview, you go 100 percent into whatever subject matter you choose", "how are you getting better", "what books were you reading", "who were you studying", "what were you trying", "brandon stanton:\u00a0i was too addicted to taking photos to ever stop for a second and learn about photography", "i have one memory of going to barnes and noble \u2013 because i couldn\u2019t afford to buy any books", "i have one memory of going to barnes and noble one night and flipping through some photography books and enjoying the photos", "but i just wanted to be out taking pictures", "i didn\u2019t really wanna be studying how to take a correct photo", "i just wanted to be out photographing", "it was the act of it, the act of discovery", "and i had a very amateur view of photography at the time where as if you get something or somebody interesting in the frame, it\u2019s a great photo", "i don\u2019t care how many points perspective it has", "i don\u2019t care about the rules of thirds", "i honestly don\u2019t really even care about white balance or focus or any of these things", "i was just looking for wonderful people and wonderful moments that were happening", "i was still doing a lot of candid photography of people", "and if i captured that, that was a good photo", "and that\u2019s all i cared about", "and that was what was driving me for these first several months and this first year, year and a half when i took thousands and thousands of pictures", "and i was getting better slowly", "i\u2019m not necessarily bragging about that kind of a version to formal training as if it was some sort of badge of honor", "it was just the way my psychology was hardwired", "and because of that, i might have improved more slowly than somebody else", "and in fact, i might have improved so slowly that i\u2019m sure a lot of professional photographers look down on my photography still", "but by being that engaged an immersed in the process as opposed to any sort of a formal structure of what makes a photograph, i innovated my own style", "i innovated my own type of work that later on \u2013 people have introduced me to studs terkel, and people introduced me to these wonderful photographers of the past, jacob riis, who took these wonderful photos of regular people that my work grew to resemble just came out of being on the street and doing it all day long and figuring out what it was that i liked the most and without any education of what a correct photograph was", "and i think if humans of new york has original elements, if humans of new york is original in any way, it was because i was just so addicted to taking photos that i never stopped to learn about photography", "and because of that, i was figuring it out as i went along", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, it seems to me also that there are many different facets of photography, one component of which is the technical knowledge, but certainly component of which is choosing the subject matter and thinking about the story that an image tells", "so, you were learning about photography, but you were doing it vis-\u00e0-vis the sheer volume of experience that you were gathering behind the camera and walking through new york city", "brandon stanton:\u00a0right", "well, i was looking for anyone who \u2013 anything that captured my attention or curiosity at all got photographed", "and that\u2019s one of the beautiful things about digital cameras is you can just take 1,000 photos every single day", "and so, you don\u2019t have to worry about conserving film", "you can just photograph everything", "and so, anything that caught my eye got photographed", "and then when you go home, and you load your 1,000 pictures on the computer, and you start going through, and because you don\u2019t know how to photograph, you photographed that person 50 different times, and you\u2019re looking at your 50 photos of each person, and you\u2019re finding the one that you think looks the best", "and then you\u2019re going, and you\u2019re doing it again, and you\u2019re doing it again", "and suddenly, you\u2019re not taking 50 photos of each person, you\u2019re taking 40, then 30, then 20, and then 10 as you start to get an idea of what it is that you think is a great photo and what it is that you like", "and that was really how i was honing in on my style again which might still be considered primitive", "it still might be considered unschooled by a lot of people", "but i was just honing in on what i liked about a photo", "and that was the process", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what were you doing with these photos in the beginning", "or maybe a better question is when you first started putting photos online, what did that look like", "brandon stanton:\u00a0one of my main weaknesses and blind spots in the beginning was not understanding the importance of daily content because i had never had a blog before", "and so, i had this great \u2013 and it mirrors my journey as a college student where i was trying to do something huge instead of focusing on doing something every single day", "and so, i had this huge, sweeping project of i was gonna photograph 10,000 people and plot their photos on a map", "i was dumping about 30 or 40 of these portraits every single day onto this website that i had that nobody was going to", "i even had a counter on the top of the website counting up to 10,000 because that\u2019s all i cared about was the end", "i was gonna get 10,000", "i was gonna create this sweeping photography project", "tim ferriss:\u00a0was it called humans of new york at the time", "or what was the name", "brandon stanton:\u00a0it was called humans of new york from the very beginning, yes", "and nobody was really paying attention", "and i was taking hundreds and thousands of portraits", "and things really started to get traction when i started posting the photos as i got them onto social media, mainly facebook", "that is when things really started to grow", "and the focus of humans of new york moved away from this giant, sweeping project that was going to cover the entire city of new york and be some sort of representation of new york city, and it switched much more to about the individual", "who is this person that i\u2019m meeting each day", "and it became something more personal and immediate", "and that\u2019s when things really started growing", "tim ferriss:\u00a0brandon, i\u2019d love to ask you about the green lady if that rings a bell", "could you please describe for folks the experience of the green lady", "brandon stanton:\u00a0so, i\u2019m in new york, and i\u2019ve been trying to make this work for about six months now", "and six months in that time of my life was probably the equivalent about two years of work because i worked every single day", "i worked on christmas", "i worked on thanksgiving", "i didn\u2019t go home", "all i did was photograph all day long", "i would go out", "i would just photograph people", "i\u2019d come home", "i would take a nap", "and then i would go out at night and try to get some more photos", "and so, i had gotten thousands of these portraits, and not many people were paying attention", "i think i had just started posting my photos on facebook", "and i photographed this woman, and she was dressed all in green", "and she had green hair and green makeup", "and i remember it was a photo that i didn\u2019t like", "i thought it was a very bad photo", "and i wasn\u2019t even going to really post it on the blog", "but then i remembered that she had said something to me", "she had said, \u201ci used to be a different color every single day", "but then one day, i was green, and that was a great day", "and so, i\u2019ve been green for 15 years.\u201d and i remember thinking to myself, \u201cwell, i don\u2019t really like the photograph, but i\u2019m gonna try putting this quote above it that she said", "and i posted it onto facebook", "and suddenly, it was the most engaged with photo that i\u2019d ever posted", "i think we\u2019re talking like, 67 likes at this time", "there was not a lot of people following my page", "and it was kind of a \u2018eureka\u2019 moment because it really made sense that during these months and almost a year of doing nothing but approaching random people in the street and asking for their photograph, the thing that strangely i had gotten to be an expert at wasn\u2019t the photography, but it was the approaching strangers and the walking up to random people, getting rejected a lot of times and not letting that affect my mood, and then once meeting somebody, in a very short amount of time, making that person comfortable", "and the \u2018eureka\u2019 moment was, \u201cif that is what i\u2019ve become good at, if that is what i have to offer the world, shouldn\u2019t i, now that i\u2019ve gotten over this fear of approaching a stranger, use that opportunity to learn a little bit about this person so that i can share a little bit about this person with other people who might be curious of the people around them but haven\u2019t been able to overcome that fear of talking to strangers?\u201d and it turned out that the audience for that, the amount of people who were curious at the lives of the people around them but were too afraid to ask, ended up being hundreds, then thousands, and then tens of thousands, and millions, and then now tens of millions", "and from that moment on, humans of new york stopped being a photography project", "i don\u2019t even view myself as a photographer", "you can write a three-page essay about why i\u2019m a horrible photographer", "and it\u2019s been done many times", "and it doesn\u2019t really bother me because i stopped viewing myself as a photographer a long time ago", "the photography\u2019s really secondary to humans of new york", "humans of new york is my effort in as short of time as possible to make a random person on the street comfortable enough and seeing somebody\u2019s interested enough in their lives that they\u2019ll share their story with me, and they\u2019ll share something deep and vulnerable and real and honest about their lives so that i can share that with millions of people every single night", "and humans of new york, over the past six years, has been my effort to get as good at that as possible", "tim ferriss:\u00a0this is a perfect segue to asking about the approaches and questions which is \u2013 brandon stanton:\u00a0which is a really important thing", "i feel guilty because i spent the entire \u2013 if you look, i have not posted a picture of myself on humans of new york in years", "i don\u2019t do it", "i find that humans of new york is best when i\u2019m the most invisible", "i feel that the less humans of new york is about brandon stanton, the more influential humans of new york has become", "so, yeah", "it feels very unnatural to have spent an hour talking already and talk nothing about myself", "so, please", "fire away", "ask about the work", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, i\u2019m gonna ask about the work", "and you can talk about yourself in third person if it makes it feel better", "but i will have to involve you in this", "what do you say when you cold approach someone on the street, assuming that now, of course, you could use humans of new york and a lot of people would recognize it, and you could break the ice that way", "but early on, when nobody would recognize that, how did you open", "and then what did you use to break the ice in the first 60 seconds", "brandon stanton:\u00a0first thing always is, \u201cdo you mind if i take your photograph?\u201d that was the first thing", "and these are all \u2013 little things i learned is you don\u2019t walk up to somebody and ask, \u201cdo you have a minute?\u201d because that immediately puts somebody on defensive because \u2013 and especially in new york city \u2013 people are walking up to you all day long trying to sell you something, asking for money", "so, people are naturally very defensive", "so, i don\u2019t want \u2013 my goal is to get into it as soon as possible so people realize that this is something a little bit different and i\u2019m not looking for their money", "that\u2019s the main thing", "i\u2019m not looking for their money", "so, i normally walk up, and i say, \u201cdo you mind if i take your photograph", "i run a website called humans of new york", "and basically, what i do is over the past several years, i\u2019ve photographed about 10,000 people on the streets of new york city and around the world", "and i just learn a little bit about everyone i photograph", "and so, i was just wondering if i could take your photo and ask you a few questions.\u201d tim ferriss:\u00a0now before you had the 10,000 and went around the world, when it was maybe the 100th person or 200th person, was it the same pitch minus that stuff", "brandon stanton:\u00a0yeah", "i was trying to give you actually the pitch that i used to give in the early days", "now i pull out my cellphone, two no", "1 new york times bestselling books, 20 million followers on facebook", "and the whole reason of that, even though it sounds boastful and braggy is that especially if somebody hasn\u2019t heard of humans of new york, i want to convince them in as short amount of time as possible that it\u2019s something real, one", "that\u2019s important", "and that it\u2019s something that a lot of people know about and a lot of people follow", "it\u2019s not a joke", "it\u2019s not a prank", "you\u2019re not gonna be embarrassed", "my goal is in as short amount of time as possible to make the person feel comfortable", "and these days, a big part of that is explaining how big the blog is because then it\u2019s like, \u201coh, this person is not trying to hustle me", "this person isn\u2019t trying to scam me.\u201d but to be honest, in the early days, the amount of people who let me take their photo wasn\u2019t that much less", "except back then i wasn\u2019t a bestselling author", "i was just a kid who was trying to make an art project", "and people wanted to help", "and so, i think a lot of people think that one of the reasons so many people are willing to talk to me is because humans of new york is so well known, especially in new york now", "but my rate of people who would talk to me was not all that different when i was just getting started", "tim ferriss:\u00a0are there any other nonverbal keys to that", "brandon stanton:\u00a0oh, yeah", "oh, god", "there are tons of them", "but again, these aren\u2019t things that i planned or read about", "it\u2019s not that i \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0you had a lot of trial and error", "brandon stanton:\u00a0well, they were burned into me by being rejected so much", "and some rejections on the streets of new york aren\u2019t always polite", "you know what i mean", "it was hard", "in the early days, i remember there were days \u2013 the hardest part about it was especially when i got started, and humans of new york didn\u2019t have any fans, and it wasn\u2019t made into any books, and my family didn\u2019t believe in it, and my friends thought i was crazy", "i had no photography experience", "i\u2019m in new york city stopping random people and asking them questions", "and i\u2019m feeling insecure", "when you walk up to somebody and you ask them if you can take their photo and they respond like you\u2019re some sort of freak or that you\u2019re weird, it\u2019s hard to not internalize that because you\u2019re so insecure at the moment about whether or not what you\u2019re doing is weird and if it\u2019s something that \u2013 am i weird for asking these people for their photographs", "and i\u2019d go out some days, and ten people in a row would make me feel like i\u2019m some sort of freak", "like, \u201cdo you know what city you\u2019re in", "you can\u2019t be stopping random people", "get out of my way", "what are you doing", "no, you can\u2019t take my photo", "get out of here.\u201d and during my formative and impressionable early days when i\u2019m trying to figure this out, five reactions like that in a row when nobody\u2019s paying attention to your work, and you\u2019ve been trying for months, and you can\u2019t figure it out, psychologically was very tough", "and there\u2019d be days where that would happen, and i just couldn\u2019t do it anymore", "and i would just go home and lay in bed", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you there", "brandon stanton:\u00a0yeah", "yeah", "yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you all right", "brandon stanton:\u00a0well, it\u2019s just the \u2013 that\u2019s the hardest part about doing it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what would you say to yourself during a period like that", "to me at least, the picture that it\u2019s painting, having experienced some dark periods in my life that have been maybe catalyzed by various things, it sounds really soul-crushing", "that sounds really \u2013 brandon stanton:\u00a0well, i was just \u2013 it was all of the doubt, and not having any money, and nobody\u2019s paying attention, and i\u2019m just doing this all day long for months, and all the tough shit was \u2013 and the loneliness too", "i didn\u2019t know anybody in new york", "i knew two people", "and there was a christmas break where those two people went home, and for two weeks, i didn\u2019t see anybody that i knew", "and i remember i spent christmas eve alone at a diner", "and then i just went out and photographed because it was the only thing that would keep me from thinking about how unlikely it was and how stupid of an idea it might be", "the only thing that i think kept me from thinking about the possibility of failing was doing it, was just photographing", "and so, whenever i started to think, \u201cis this gonna work", "is it not gonna work?\u201d i\u2019d just go out and photograph", "that was my only way of keeping those wolves away of, \u201cis this ultimately going to be a success", "am i wasting my time", "am i stupid?\u201d the only way to keep those away was to go out and work", "and so, that\u2019s what i would do just all day long and do it and do it and do it", "and so, these negative things like the rejection of people and people saying no that i was talking about, all of the negative stuff, the thing that was counteracting that all the time was just loving it so much", "i just loved it so much", "and so, yeah", "it was just the same way i was obsessed with markets", "i was obsessed with taking photos", "and so, that\u2019s what carried me through it all", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and in listening to this story, it makes me wanna ask you \u2013 when i look at humans of new york and think about how many thousands of people you\u2019ve humanized and how much empathy you\u2019ve created traveling to other countries, helping to paint a more complete picture of humanity instead of allowing mass media distortion to create us versus them mentality or counteracting that at least to a very real degree and helping millions of people who have been exposed to your work and the interviews to feel less alone, that\u2019s a huge fucking deal", "it pains me to hear a story like this", "but it\u2019s so helpful for you to share it because i wonder how many people have ended up in that diner alone and just quit", "they just stopped", "brandon stanton:\u00a0t\u2019s not even about stopping", "i think humans of new york wor \u2013 it\u2019s not about goals or mission", "i had a goal, and i had a mission", "but people just feel alone", "period", "that\u2019s why humans of new york has succeeded", "and i\u2019m not even talking about the people reading it", "the no", "1 question that people ask me is, \u201chow do you get people to share with you?\u201d and i think for most people \u2013 and they\u2019re not just if you follow humans of new york", "yesterday, i was talking with a woman who \u2013 she had not heard of humans of new york", "this is a perfect example", "she was catching a train", "she had 30 minutes", "she had never heard of humans of new york", "we started out with me showing her the blog", "and 30 minutes later, the place that we ended up at was she was in this purgatory where her husband was depressed and an alcoholic", "and he wasn\u2019t doing anything that was ultimately so bad", "he didn\u2019t beat her", "he didn\u2019t cheat on her", "but she wasn\u2019t getting fulfilled", "and she was wondering if she was living her best life by staying with him for the kids", "and she came to this place where she admitted that she was secretly hoping that he would do something bad to make the decision easier on her", "and that sort of honesty and that sort of truth and that sort of rawness \u2013 i don\u2019t know if she\u2019d even admitted that to herself before", "and people ask me \u2013 and that happens all the time, tim", "that\u2019s good humans of new york", "some of it\u2019s just pictures of kids saying cute stuff, and some of it\u2019s cute couples talking about their relationship", "but good humans of new york is when we get to that moment when me and somebody are thinking through something or talking through something that they might not have thought through before", "and the way people say, \u201chow do you get there with a complete stranger?\u201d i think that whenever i\u2019m talking to somebody on the street, there are two threads running through their head at any given time", "and one of them is this fear of being exposed, this feeling of being vulnerable and discomfort", "\u201cwho is this guy", "why is he asking me these questions?\u201d and on the other hand, there is this appreciation of being heard that even though i don\u2019t know this guy, this is the first person who has taken such a focused and detailed interest in my problems", "and the feeling of having somebody focus so intensely not on the sports teams you like or the music you like or any of the other trivial things that we get asked on a daily basis but these real things that you\u2019re struggling with and maybe not even on the top of your mind but in the back of your mind that you\u2019re not even really bringing to the surface, being heard like that is such a validating thing that that\u2019s why people always share", "and i tell people at the beginning of every interview that these questions are going to be hard", "and anything you don\u2019t wanna answer you don\u2019t have to answer", "and we talked about when they got molested as a child", "we talk about them cheating on their husbands", "we talk about their alcoholism", "we talk about how they don\u2019t love their child as much as they expected they would", "we talk about all these things", "and almost never to people say, \u201ci don\u2019t wanna talk about that", "i don\u2019t wanna talk about that.\u201d and i think the reason humans of new york works isn\u2019t because the people who are reading it feel alone", "that\u2019s a big part of it", "it\u2019s that people, when they see somebody being vulnerable in a way that they\u2019re afraid to be vulnerable themselves, they connect with that person", "but it really works because the people on the street that i meet are so thankful to have somebody really listen to them that in that bubble, in an hour and a half where i\u2019m sitting with a stranger on the street, this magic happens where they\u2019re willing to let me in to a space in their mind or their soul or whatever it is that they don\u2019t really let other people into", "and it\u2019s that place that i think connects with so many people", "tim ferriss:\u00a0that\u2019s an incredible gift/talent that you\u2019ve developed that allows you to make people comfortable enough to open up to that extent in 30 minutes", "that is incredibly impressive to me, even give the fact that perhaps one of the elements underpinning it is how heard they feel which is absolutely, i\u2019m sure, the case", "i think about questions a lot", "and you have much more experience than i do", "and that just blows me away that you\u2019re able to get there in such a short period of time", "what are some of the other ingredients or aspects of it that help you to \u2013 questions perhaps that help you to get there", "brandon stanton:\u00a0it\u2019s not the questions", "i have about three or four entry questions that i use", "\u201cwhat\u2019s your biggest struggle?\u201d \u201chow has your life turned out differently than you expected it to?\u201d \u201cwhat do you feel most guilty about?\u201d but really, the planned questions are just springboards into a conversation", "and how you get to that deep place with a person is absolute presence", "it\u2019s being 100 percent there", "you\u2019re not thinking in the framework of an interview", "you\u2019re not looking at a list of questions", "you\u2019re not thinking about your next question", "you\u2019re not thinking about how this person fits into your idea of them and what you know about them", "you\u2019re 100 percent there, and you\u2019re 100 percent listening to them, and your questions are 100 percent coming based on curiosity about what they are telling you and nothing else", "and why it is that i think humans of new york is special and i think humans of new york is something that is precious and maybe difficult to replicate is that i\u2019ve spent seven years in these conversations with 10,000 people", "and it\u2019s not necessarily that i have gotten so good at asking questions", "it\u2019s just that i\u2019ve gotten so comfortable in the presence of a stranger and so comfortable in the presence of somebody that i just met that i can sit there with them without an ounce of self-consciousness and just be and just be there with them and listen to them and be curious about them", "and there\u2019s this energy that happens there, that this doesn\u2019t feel like somebody that\u2019s interviewing you", "it feels like somebody who knows you and cares about, is really interested in what\u2019s going on in your life", "and it\u2019s very subtle and hard to describe, but i think it\u2019s that energy and that presence and that being there", "and it\u2019s something i had to earn", "it\u2019s the same thing like public speaking", "when do you really get good at public speaking", "it\u2019s when you\u2019ve done it so much that you can be yourself on the stage", "and there is only one way to get there", "and that\u2019s to be on stage, scared as shit, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again", "and i think the only way to get to that place where you can have that rapport with a stranger is not by studying interview techniques", "it\u2019s by sitting with thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of strangers until nothing feels strange about it anymore and you\u2019re able to be in that calm, present place", "and what happens is your interview transfers to the other person, and they get to that place too", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if we were to pick up the example that you gave just a few minutes ago about this woman talking about her relationship with her husband and his depression and alcoholism and so on, if you remember, how did you end up there", "in other words, do you recall how the conversation headed to that point", "brandon stanton:\u00a0oh, yeah", "well, let me give you another example since i already \u2013 let me give you an example of somebody i talked to in the philippines a few weeks ago", "same thing", "i\u2019ve traveled to 30 different countries now", "i\u2019ve done the exact same work", "i\u2019ve been to pakistan", "i\u2019ve been to iran", "i\u2019ve been to iraq", "and i work with interpreters", "and the process is exactly the same", "i just walk up to random people and get into these conversations with them", "there was a woman in a park in the philippines", "and i started asking her \u2013 i think one of the first questions i asked her was, \u201cwhat is your biggest goal in life?\u201d and she said she wanted to have a good family life", "and so, i thought that that was the story, and i started asking about that", "and i learned that she wanted to have a good family life because when she was young, her family split", "and she was forced to go to the courthouse with her mom and her dad at the age of nine", "and a judge made her choose which parent she wanted to go with", "and so, i thought that was the story", "and so, i started asking questions about that", "and then i learned that she ended up going with her mom", "and afterwards, her mom remarried, and she didn\u2019t like her new stepfather, so she ran away", "and i thought that that was the story", "so, i started asking questions about that", "and then i found out that the reason she ran away was because her stepfather was abusing her and that she had never told a person in her life, including her mom until that moment that that had happened", "and that\u2019s how we end up in those places is i am just curious about what\u2019s going on in there", "i\u2019m just curious about what happened", "i want to know the story", "and i just ask, and i ask, and i ask", "and if something\u2019s not quite making sense, i wanna know why", "and so, i ask more, and i ask more", "somebody can choose eventually to not tell the truth by saying, \u201ci\u2019m uncomfortable with it,\u201d but it can\u2019t really be concealed if somebody is really, really, really, really curious", "you know what i mean", "you can never get to the point \u2013 humans of new york interviews don\u2019t work, i always say it\u2019s not because somebody doesn\u2019t have an interesting story", "humans of new york interviews don\u2019t work when i reach a place when somebody\u2019s uncomfortable with the process which is absolutely fine", "that\u2019s completely understandable", "i\u2019m a random person", "i\u2019m sharing these stories with 20 million people", "it\u2019s 100 percent fine if you don\u2019t wanna share", "that is nothing against you at all", "but those are the interviews that don\u2019t make it on the blog", "it\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t interesting", "it\u2019s that humans of new york really thrives on this kind of honesty", "and if somebody\u2019s willing to be honest, everybody\u2019s got an interesting story", "and so, it\u2019s like the \u2013 i hit dead ends not because somebody is boring", "it\u2019s because somebody isn\u2019t comfortable with disclosing", "and so, that\u2019s what defines the humans of new york interview or what is usable of the humans of new york interview", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how often when they do go there and disclose these very vulnerable stories or things they\u2019ve never told anyone else, how often do they ask that you not use it or express concern that it\u2019s gonna cause some type of problem for them", "brandon stanton:\u00a0well, that\u2019s one thing that i am very principled about", "i give the person agency every step of the way", "i tell them, \u201canything you don\u2019t wanna an \u2013\u201d first of all, they don\u2019t have to talk to me", "they have that decision", "once we start talking, i say, \u201cany question you don\u2019t wanna answer, you don\u2019t have to answer", "if you tell me something during the course of this interview and you change your mind afterwards and don\u2019t want me to share it, that\u2019s fine", "at the end of the interview, if you would like me to photograph your hands or your feet instead of your face, we can do that.\u201d in fact, if it\u2019s a very vulnerable story, i will normally insist on that to protect the person or protect somebody that they\u2019re talking about", "\u201cif after i\u2019ve done the interview and before it\u2019s posted, at any time you change your mind and you don\u2019t want me to share it,\u201d i give them my email address", "\u201cand after the photo is up for any reason at any time, if you become uncomfortable from all the attention and would like me to take the story down, i immediately will.\u201d and so, people have control of it every step of the way", "it\u2019s very important to me that nobody ever sees humans of new york as something that was done to them", "i always want it to be seen as something that was done with them", "and have i failed at that sometimes", "out of the 10,000 people have i interviewed, have there been people who didn\u2019t expect me to share a certain part of their story or were surprised by it or it was a negative experience for", "there have been a handful", "but i can only say that those are the worst moments for me when humans of new york was a negative experience for somebody because that\u2019s who i really care about is the people that are on the blog because they\u2019re the people who i had that moment with", "i spent an hour and a half with them, and we got to that place", "if they are hurt by it, especially if they were really vulnerable, that\u2019s when i feel the worst about myself because i know how much pressure that spotlight can be", "and i know how difficult it can be having 20 million people look at you", "and so, if i ever feel that i maybe accidentally mispresented it, that\u2019s when i feel the worst", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how do you think about money as it relates to humans of new york", "ostensibly, you want to probably eat more than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and eggs now", "at the same \u2013 brandon stanton:\u00a0and i mean, it\u2019s \u2013 yeah", "go ahead", "tim ferriss:\u00a0no, i was just gonna say in terms of what you do with advertising or partnerships or projects, because you have also such sensitive \u2013 not always but you have such potentially sensitive subject matter", "and it\u2019s so personalized for these folks in many cases", "how do you think about that", "brandon stanton:\u00a0right", "so, humans of new york, i think we\u2019ve sold a million and a half books", "the television show, facebook", "and facebook, there\u2019s more than one person interested in it", "and facebook, they compensated me well for the four years of work that i worked on the television series", "so, i\u2019m very comfortable right now", "humans of new york has made me a \u2013 let\u2019s just say i\u2019m not worrying about peanut butter and sandwiches", "i\u2019m very comfortable", "with that being said, i will say that humans of new york has raised \u2013 i\u2019ve made a fraction of the money with humans of new york that we have raised for charity, a small fraction of the money that we\u2019ve raised for charity", "i\u2019ve turned down maybe more money than i\u2019ve made from people who want to use my brand to partner with their brand", "big brands have offered me a lot of money to do \u201chumans of\u2026\u201d and i\u2019m just gonna make up some names", "you know what i mean", "like, \u201chumans of merecdes-benz,\u201d humans of china, sponsored by virgin airlines.\u201d these are all fake things that i\u2019m making up right now but resembled offers that have been made to me", "where i make the dividing line is that i\u2019m willing to make money as brandon stanton", "a big part of my income comes from speeches", "i give about ten of these a year", "and that is a big part of my income", "i sell books as brandon stanton", "i don\u2019t sell the name humans of new york to anyone", "i don\u2019t rent my brand to anyone because i never want any piece of content that i share to have a single motive", "i\u2019ve never broken that seal", "and it\u2019s been so tempting, but i just know if i break it once, i\u2019m never going to get it back", "so, for seven years, i\u2019ve never been compensated for a piece of content that i\u2019ve posted on my blog", "and that is the main delineation that i make between what can be monetized and what can\u2019t", "and because of that, like i said, i\u2019m not worrying about peanut butter and sandwiches anymore", "but there is a little bit of an insecurity", "am i gonna look back in 40 years if everything suddenly goes away, and facebook and instagram, nobody are using anymore, am i gonna be like, \u201coh, man", "i\u2019m working the nightshift now", "and i had 20 million followers 20 years ago", "maybe i should have tried a little harder to make some money\u2019", "but that\u2019s how i view it now", "tim ferriss:\u00a0should have done those humans of new york lunchboxes while i had the chance", "brandon stanton:\u00a0there you go", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, you mentioned the book", "i\u2019d like to chat about that for a second because it\u2019s been the \u2013 well, books at this point, certainly", "but at least as i understand it, the first book sold millions of copies, certainly more than a million", "was it easy to find a publisher for that first book", "brandon stanton:\u00a0no", "i barely did", "macmillan, god bless them", "so, at the time, i think when i sold the book, i had a few hundred thousand facebook fans", "and it was growing so fast", "there was so much energy", "things were really taking off", "and i just thought, \u201coh, my gosh", "everybody\u2019s gonna wanna publish this book.\u201d and there\u2019s six big publishers", "i\u2019m sure you know all this", "or seven or something like that", "and the goal is to get all of them interested", "and then in the perfect world, all of them are interested, and then they bid against each other", "and so, only three of them would meet with me, or four of them maybe", "and during those meetings, i thought that i killed it", "i thought, \u201coh, man", "oh", "i described it so well", "i presented so well", "they\u2019re all gonna be very interested.\u201d and so, we had an auction", "and the bids were due by 12:00 noon on one day", "and at 11:00, i hadn\u2019t heard anything from my agent", "and i was just like, \u201cwell, what\u2019s going on?\u201d so, i texted him", "and he goes, \u201coh, the first three dropped out", "they didn\u2019t make an offer", "there\u2019s still one that we haven\u2019t heard from yet.\u201d and i\u2019m just like, \u201coh, my god,\u201d because well, that book was my life raft because i didn\u2019t have any money at that time", "i was hoping to get a little bit of a book deal so i could pay my bills", "and i just remember i went to the ymca, and i just ran five miles because i thought it was gonna be the worst day of my life", "and then when i got on the treadmill, i found out that macmillan had made a small but respectable offer", "and that\u2019s how i got a book deal by the skin of my teeth which was lucrative for all parties involved", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and what were some of the reasons for not meeting with you or not putting in an offer that they gave", "brandon stanton:\u00a0because there\u2019s two types of books that have a history of not selling well", "well, there are a lot of types", "but mine fit two categories", "it was a photography book", "photography books don\u2019t sell based on conventional wisdom", "and it was what they viewed as a regional book where it is a photography book centered on a single city", "therefore, nobody\u2019s going to want it", "that was the argument against publishing humans of new york", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oops", "yeah", "i love these stories because they are the rule and not the exception for so many things that turn into something", "brandon stanton:\u00a0well, things that are not derivative", "you know what i mean", "in my mind, the most valuable idea is the one that nobody\u2019s ever seen before", "that\u2019s when you\u2019ve got the gold", "but you\u2019ve got a better chance of just choosing something else that\u2019s good and making something derivative on it because then when you go into these places and you pitch, you can say, \u201coh, this is 50 shades of gray, but with furries.\u201d i don\u2019t know", "it\u2019s funny that for me, as an artist and as a creator, the last thing i ever want to do is be describing my work as, \u201cit\u2019s this but with a twist.\u201d you know what i mean", "i wanna be creating something new", "however, in the marketplace, the things that have most likely chance of getting bought are things that people can peg to other past successes", "and so, when you walk in with something like what i thought was humans of new york\u2019s greatest value which was there really wasn\u2019t anything else like it at the time, they viewed as its biggest detriment", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "\u201cbut what are the comparables?\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cthat\u2019s the whole point", "there aren\u2019t any comparables.\u201d brandon stanton:\u00a0yeah, right", "comparables", "that fucking word", "are you kidding me", "and the same thing when i was making the television series", "the same thing", "as an artist, i want this to be like nothing else that\u2019s been cre \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing i care about is making something that\u2019s really unlike anything else", "if it\u2019s like something else, i don\u2019t really want to obsess over it for three years trying to make it", "my goal is to make something new and something fresh", "and when you\u2019re trying to get compensated for your work, the thing that you care about the most as an artist is often the thing that\u2019s held against you the most because people are risk averse, and they want to see something comparable that has also done well", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what\u2019s next for you", "do you have five-year plans, three-year plans, and so on at this point", "or is it still 24 hours by 24 hours", "what\u2019s next for you", "brandon stanton:\u00a0i do", "i\u2019m having a baby", "so, that\u2019s gonna be new", "tim ferriss:\u00a0congratulations", "that\u2019s a big deal", "brandon stanton:\u00a0thank you", "having a baby in july", "so, beyond that which is going to be new \u2013 for me, right now, the biggest kind of artistic tension is knowing \u2013 because of my experience on social media the past seven years, knowing how social media works, knowing the importance of output and content and daily content and engagement and things like that, knowing how to build an audience on one hand and wanting to push myself as an artist on the other hand", "and what i really wanna do as an artist i wanna withdraw from the daily output model", "i wanna work on things that have longer timeframes, that are more polished, that are maybe longer but take longer to produce and more resources", "but in order to do that, that requires me to pull back from the blog which the golden rule of social media is keep engaging with your audience", "keep connecting with your audience", "don\u2019t lose touch", "don\u2019t lose touch", "don\u2019t lose touch", "but the artist in me wants to go disappear for a while and go into a dark cave and come out with something", "so, i think that is the main push and pull in my mind right now", "so, i\u2019m gonna be going to the philippines next month to work on \u2013 i\u2019m gonna spend a month filming a documentary on somebody because i love documentaries, and i wanna make a documentary that is very interesting", "so, that might not be what\u2019s best for business or best for growing audience or best by social media metrics", "but that is what is exciting to me", "and it all comes back to that moment", "it\u2019s so funny", "and i think you\u2019re probably the same way is that we have these mantras and these things that we\u2019ve learned that we stand on stage and we say and we think about", "\u201cdon\u2019t wait for the perfect idea", "it\u2019s never gonna seem perfect", "you just gotta go after it.\u201d \u201cchoose what is nourishing in the moment,\u201d things like that", "and if you\u2019re like me, i have to preach to myself a lot and tell myself the same thing that i\u2019m telling other people because it\u2019s so easy to fall back into what everybody else is struggling with as well because you never truly escape it", "and so, one of the things that i do is i go back to that moment when i lost my job and i was walking in chicago, and i asked myself, \u201cif nothing mattered but how i was spending my time, what would i be doing", "what would be most nourishing for me in any given moment if nothing else mattered except for how i spent my time?\u201d and i\u2019m trying to remind myself of that, the same thing i tell other people", "and right now, i wanna go to the philippines, and i wanna make a documentary", "and it might not be best for business", "and it might not be best for humans of new york, but it\u2019s what brandon wants to do", "and so, that is the north star that i\u2019m trying to follow", "tim ferriss:\u00a0good for you, man", "i\u2019m excited for you to disappear for a little while", "that may come off the wrong way, but i think you get the sentiment behind it", "and i have a random suggestion which is if you have not read cryptonomicon which is a book by neal stephenson who also wrote snow crash \u2013 brandon stanton:\u00a0oh, i love snow crash", "i love snow crash", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, cryptonomicon, part of the through line, one of the narratives takes place in the philippines", "so, that could be fun to pick up", "but brandon, thank you so much for taking the time today", "this was really a wonderful experience for me", "and thank you for being vulnerable also and filling in some of the color in the story of your life thus far", "it\u2019s been really nice to get to know you a little better in this conversation", "brandon stanton:\u00a0yeah", "well, thank you so much", "hope some of that\u2019s usable", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "i think it is", "is there anything else you would like to ask of people, suggest to people", "any closing comments before we wrap up", "brandon stanton:\u00a0no, i think that\u2019s it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0all right", "awesome", "well, once again, really appreciate you making the time, particularly to how much you think about how you spend your time, to chat with me and with everybody today", "and for everyone listening, you can, as always find links to everything that we have spoken about, to all of brandon\u2019s projects as well in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast", "and until next time, do what is nourishing for you in the moment, or at least ponder the question", "and thanks for listening", "hey, guys", "this is tim again", "just a few more things before you take off", "no", "1, this is 5-bullet friday", "do you want to get a short email from me", "would you enjoy getting a short email from me every friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend", "and 5-bullet friday is a very short email where i share the coolest things i\u2019ve found or that i\u2019ve been pondering over the week", "that could include favorite new albums that i\u2019ve discovered", "it could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that i\u2019ve somehow dug up in the world of the esoteric, as i do", "it could include favorite articles that i have read and that i\u2019ve shared with my close friends, for instance", "and it\u2019s very short", "it\u2019s just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend", "so, if you want to receive that, check it out", "just go to fourhourworkweek.com, that\u2019s fourhourworkweek.com all spelled out, and just drop in your email, and you will get the very next one", "and if you sign up, i hope you enjoy it"]}
