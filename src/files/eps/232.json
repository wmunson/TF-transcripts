Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show. This is a Tim Ferriss Radio Hour, which is a special edition. I will come back to that in a second. As always, it\u2019s my job to deconstruct world-class performers of all different types, to tease out the habits, routines, breakfasts or lack thereof, favorite books, etc., that you can test and apply in your own life. They come from many different worlds: entrepreneurship, athletics, entertainment, special operations, and so on. And the goal is tactical-practical, so very specific advice and suggested purchases or otherwise that you can immediately apply. Now, after more than 200 of these conversations, you can start to spot certain patterns. These are the shared habits, hacks, philosophies, tools, and so on, that are the common threads. This is very interesting to me and a very common question from you all, for instance. And this ranges from meditation to fitness to many different domains. You start to spot the common threads of excellence, even across many different disciplines. So, these commonalities were the premise of my most recent book and No.\u00a01 New York Times bestseller, Tools of Titans. So, thank you guys, so much for making that possible, which is a compilation of many of my favorite lessons, routines, tips, and so on, from 100-plus different folks. These episodes in the Tim Ferriss Radio Hour are a concentrated dose of the patterns organized around themes that you guys have requested. So, in this particular episode, I have gathered some of the best advice from past guests about fitness, nutrition, and for lack of a better term, wellness, although that term bugs me, but it\u2019s a good catchall. In this episode, I talk to, for instance, retired four-star General Stanley McChrystal, to hear how he explains how he not only survived but thrived on one meal per day for years. Stanley McChrystal: And I do find that there are certain days your body just says, \u201cEat, and eat right now.\u201d And I used to keep a bin of those hard pretzels in my office in Afghanistan, and I\u2019d grab a handful of those. Tim Ferriss: I also talk to world-famous performance coach, Tony Robbins, one of my favorites. Of course, I got started reading a lot of his stuff, even as far back as college. And I ask him to explain his morning discipline and routines. Tony Robbins: Because your brain\u2019s going, \u201cYou\u2019re going to freeze to death.\u201d It sounds horrific. It really isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll find out it\u2019s not that painful. Going in my cold plunge of 57 degrees feels more jolting than this does, even though it\u2019s colder. Tim Ferriss: Then we dig into the habits of Dutch world-record holder, adventurer, daredevil, and all-round crazy guy, Wim Hof, and discuss his ability to control or at least affect \u2013 this is consciously affect \u2013 his supposed autonomous immune system, which is fascinating. Wim Hof: \u201cYou are the Iceman. You do exceptional features, but nobody is able to do that without that proper training of so many years.\u201d And I told him, \u201cNo, I can train them within ten days.\u201d Tim Ferriss: And we end the episode by getting down and dirty into the science of ketosis with Dr. Dominic D\u2019Agostino, also known as Dom, as we discuss nutritional strategies for peak performers. And Dom, just in case you don\u2019t know, he can do a weeklong fast and then deadlift 500 pounds for something like ten repetitions in front of his class that he teaches. So, he\u2019s not only Bruce Banner, but the Incredible Hulk. So, without further ado, let\u2019s get started. I hope you enjoy this episode of the Tim Ferriss Radio Hour. Former Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, described Stanley McChrystal as, quote, \u201cperhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat I have ever met,\u201d end quote. That is high praise certainly and for good reason. McChrystal served as commander of the joint special operations command \u2212 shorthand is JSOC; you may have heard of that \u2013 where he was credited with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. His last assignment was as the commander of all American and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Now, we talked about a lot. We had, I want to say, about a two\u2011hour conversation. One of the things that stood out was how Stan rewards himself with a large dinner at night because he doesn\u2019t handle smaller meals throughout the day very well. While this might seem odd, it\u2019s actually become a more and more popular approach to diet with the rise of intermittent fasting. And there are many different varieties of intermittent fasting. There\u2019s 5:2, where you eat normally for five days of the week, and then for two days, you might eat sub-calorically or even go down to, say, 500 calories, or fast completely, so that would be intermittent fasting on a weekly schedule, which I\u2019ve tested. Then you have, for instance, say, 16 hours of fasting and eight hours of eating, or the opposite, you could 18 and six. There are many different ways to approach this. A lot of the male peak performers over the age of 40 that I\u2019ve interviewed skip breakfast, a very high percentage. This includes Wim Hof, for instance, who\u2019s coming up later, and many, many others. There are exceptions, though, who do things slightly differently. Art De Vany, who\u2019s worth checking out, he\u2019s older than 80 years of age and shredded, still an athlete, an economist. And if you haven\u2019t heard his episode, you also should hear that one. But he does a reasonably sized breakfast, trains a few hours later, and then fasts until dinner. So, he does breakfast, no lunch, and then dinner. I have at least recently found this to be more effective for me personally, and particularly on training days. If I can time it such that I train earlier in the day, I find it particularly effective. When I skip breakfast, I would say 20 percent of the time or so, I find myself fatigued in the afternoon because I postpone lunch too long. So, if I\u2019m going to skip breakfast, it\u2019s important a) that I wake up on the earlier side, and b) that I have lunch, say, four to five hours after walking. Otherwise, I tend to have a slump in energy in the afternoon and then to self-medicate with caffeine, exogenous ketones, and all sorts of other things. So, at the moment, I find that I function best if I am on, say, a weight-training and athletic schedule, meaning I have multiple sessions of movement throughout the week, either breakfast and dinner, skipping lunch, or three meals a day. And I will do my intermittent fasting in a slightly different way, and I do think the term, intermittent fasting, is used so often to have almost become meaningless. But I like to do a contiguous three-day fast each month, generally Thursday dinner to Sunday dinner, and that should be medically supervised. And this is largely at the recommendation or based on my conversations with Dom D\u2019Agostino, which comes up later. Now, before I get too ahead of myself, let\u2019s listen to McChrystal\u2019s specific approach. I have a slew of questions, but the one that I have been asked to ask you, Stan, more than perhaps any other is, why one meal a day? Do you actually eat one meal a day? Stanley McChrystal: I do, and people ask me why. Is it some Zen connection with something? And, no. What happened was when I was a lieutenant in Special Forces many, many years ago, I thought I was getting fat, and I started running. And I started running distanced, which I enjoyed. But I also found that my personality was such that I\u2019m not real good at eating three or four small, disciplined meals. I\u2019m better to defer gratification and then eat one meal, and for me, that\u2019s dinner. And so, what I do is I sort of push myself hard all day, try to get everything done, and then sort of reward myself with dinner at night. Tim Ferriss: What time do you usually eat dinner? Stanley McChrystal: Well, whenever I\u2019m finished work, and it would be 8:00 or 8:30. There\u2019s a challenge when you work really long hours because, suddenly, you start to eat very late, and then you go directly to bed, and you feel like you\u2019re sleeping with a football on your stomach. Tim Ferriss: And do you drink coffee earlier in the day? I\u2019m just thinking, with the workout and that many hours, a lot of people would fade. How do you prevent yourself from fading? Stanley McChrystal: Yeah, I have a tendency, I\u2019ll drink coffee. I\u2019ll drink other beverages, too, water and different things. And I do find that there are certain days your body just says, \u201cEat, and eat right now.\u201d And I used to keep a bin of those hard pretzels in my office in Afghanistan, and I\u2019d grab a handful of those. And other times, I might be out doing something physical in the military, like road marching, and suddenly, your body communicates, \u201cEat pretty quickly, or you won\u2019t keep road marching,\u201d and I\u2019ll do that. But, otherwise, I like to stick to the idea of one a night. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Yeah, this is a constant topic of conversation in the intermittent fasting world, and everyone has \u2212 Ori Hofmekler has his thing; the Paleo guys have their thoughts obviously. Chris, are you a one-meal-a-day kind of guy? Chris: Well, when I was working for then General McChrystal as his aide-de-camp, his last year running the Joint Special Operations Command, it was sort of by directive. There was no other choice. That was just what we call the battle rhythm of the organization. And when the old man got to eat, you did it then, or you didn\u2019t do it at all. So, yeah, I\u2019ve lived on that train. But I would be the first to tell others because, as Stan alluded to, it sort of became the driver in the organization, this is what we do. And I would tell people, as his aide, \u201cHe won\u2019t judge you if you eat breakfast. This is the way his metabolism works. He doesn\u2019t do this as a demonstration of personal strength. This is just what works. So, don\u2019t think you\u2019re impressing him by not eating lunch or whatever.\u201d But there was a classic story around this when I first joined the inner-circle staff. We had this command sergeant major, who I\u2019ll call Jody, a legend in the community. He had been with Stan for about three and a half years at that point. And so, I was asking him about the one-meal-a-day thing, and he said, when he showed up, for the first year \u2013 he\u2019s two feet from Stan for the entire five years they worked together \u2013 and he said, \u201cWell, this is what the boss does. This is what I\u2019ll do.\u201d So, he did a meal a day, and he does not have the metabolism that [inaudible]. And we lived in these little, crummy, sort of Quonset huts next to where the headquarters was. Tim Ferriss: Did you say Quonset huts? Chris: Just sort of wooden huts \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Right. Chris: \u2212 pretty spartan living, about 50 yards from where the headquarters was in Iraq. And Jody said, about a year into the tour, that General McChrystal calls him and says, \u201cJody, get in here.\u201d So, he runs over. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, sir?\u201d And he said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t really looked through his hooch before.\u201d And he said, \u201cGeneral McChrystal\u2019s pointing at this little tin of pretzels he has, and he goes, \u2018I think there\u2019s mice eating my pretzels.'\u201d And Jody said, \u201cI almost whipped out my gun and shot him.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been eating pretzels? I\u2019ve been eating one meal a day \u2013\u201d Tim Ferriss: Dark secret. Chris: \u201c\u2212 for a year, and you have pretzels in your room.\u201d He goes, \u201cIt was the most unprofessional I\u2019ve ever been with a general officer. I just stormed out of the room.\u201d Tim Ferriss: You know, low blood sugar will do that. Chris: That was so funny. Tim Ferriss: Makes cowards of men, long-distance running and low blood sugar. Working out \u2013 do you work out every day? Stanley McChrystal: I do. Tim Ferriss: What type of exercise, and why? Stanley McChrystal: When I was younger and I got serious about working out, I was a second lieutenant, and as I mentioned, I started getting fat. And I had a first sergeant in my parachute infantry company that liked to run. So, we would do loosening-up exercises, and then we\u2019d run. And so, I started running, and so, for the first 20 or so years, I ran. I had one period when I was a captain when I ran 15 miles a day, seven days a week, didn\u2019t vary, didn\u2019t take days off, wore lousy running shoes. It was sort of stereotypically all the mistakes you can make. As I got older and I started to have a series of shoulder surgeries and back surgeries predictably, what I learned to do was to alternate. So, I will run one day, I will lift weight the next day, I\u2019ll bike when I\u2019m home and have that capability, so I can round out. But, for me, it\u2019s very important to do something literally every day. I\u2019ll only take a day off when I\u2019m forced to because I\u2019ve got some weird schedule thing that makes it impossible. Tim Ferriss: And what does your weight training, your resistance training workout look like? Stanley McChrystal: Yeah, I will start at my home, if we\u2019re at home, and I go down to my basement, and I do four sets of pushups, as many as I can do for four sets. And I alternate that with a series of abs exercises. So, I\u2019ll do, starting with a set of sit-ups, and I\u2019ll do 100 sit-ups. And I\u2019ll flip over, and I\u2019ll do three minutes of a plank. And then I\u2019ll do some yoga that I learned for about two or three minutes. Then I\u2019ll do another set of pushups. Then I\u2019ll go to my next abs thing, which is a crunch-like crossover. Then I\u2019ll do a two-and-a-half-minute plank. And then I\u2019ll do more yoga, slightly different. Then I\u2019ll do another set of pushups, and then I\u2019ll do my third set, which is crossover sit-ups. And I\u2019ll then do a third plank of two minutes. I\u2019m decreasing each time. Then I\u2019ll do some more yoga. And then I\u2019ll do my fourth set of pushups. And then I\u2019ll do my fourth, which is a flutter kick, 60 flutter kicks, followed by a static. Then I\u2019ll do my fourth plank, which is now a minute and a half. And then I\u2019ll come back. I only do four sets of pushups, so the last time, I don\u2019t do pushups. I then do one more set of the crunch-like, and I\u2019ll flip over, do my last plank, which is one minute. And then I\u2019ll do some final yoga. And that\u2019ll take me about 45 to 50 minutes. Then I\u2019ll leave my house and go to the gym because my gym opens at 5:30. It\u2019s three blocks from my house. Tim Ferriss: I assume we mean a.m. Stanley McChrystal: Yeah. So, I can do all this from 4:30 \u2013 if I get up at 4:00, I can do all that from 4:30 to about 5:20, 5:25, go down to my gym. And then when I get to the gym, I do four sets of pullups, alternated with incline bench press, alternated with standing curls. And then, in that, I\u2019ll also do these one-legged things, balance exercises, as the break between them. I was taught that was good for balance and whatnot. And then I\u2019ll do a few other things in there. And I can do all that in 30, 35 minutes. So, by 6:15, 6:20, I can be done at the gym, head back home, get cleaned up, and then be starting work. Tim Ferriss: Ready to rock and roll. Stanley McChrystal: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And why is exercise important to you, both when you were overseas and at home? Maybe the reasons differ. But why is that routine, ritual important? Stanley McChrystal: I think it\u2019s several things. There\u2019s a certain self-image. I think that if I was struggling with my weight, or if I was not as fit as I wanted people to perceive me, and I couldn\u2019t perceive myself that way, I think my own self-esteem would suffer. And particularly, over life now, whenever I\u2019m injured and I have even a slight period, it bothers me a lot, so I think that\u2019s part of it. Second is the military. There\u2019s an expectation. If you are not a physical leader in the kind of organizations that Chris and I were in, if you can\u2019t do those things physically \u2013 you don\u2019t have to do it better than everybody else, but you have to do it credibly, and they can look up to \u2013 then I think your status in the organization is going to go down. When I left Ranger battalion command in 1996, and I went off to spend a year at Harvard, and I remember one of my non-commissioned officers said, \u201cSir, what are you going to do at Harvard?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to study.\u201d He says, \u201cYou going to work out?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, presumably, I will.\u201d And he goes, \u201cYou know, you come back here with a PhD, but you\u2019re out of shape, we\u2019re going to have a word for you, and it ain\u2019t gonna be doctor.\u201d And I just thought that was so good. It also puts a discipline in the day. I find that, if the day is terrible or whatever, but I worked out, at the end of the day, I can go, \u201cWell, I had a good workout,\u201d almost no matter what happens. When the Rolling Stone article came out, it came out about 1:30 in the morning, I found out about it. I made a couple calls. I knew we had a big problem. And I went and put my clothes on, and I ran for an hour, clear my head, destress myself, didn\u2019t make it go away, but that was something that I\u2019d do in those situations. Tim Ferriss: Not long ago, I flew to Florida to interview peak performance coach, Tony Robbins, who has long been someone I\u2019ve looked up to and learned a lot from. He\u2019s very good at getting people to not only hear advice, but take action on that advice. Now, aside from asking him to palm my face with his massive hands \u2212 that was actually the very first Instagram photo I ever put up, which you can check out on Instagram, timferriss with two Rs and two Ss, if you want to see a picture of his ginormous hands covering my entire head \u2013 but, besides that, he allowed me to dive really deep into the various routines and frameworks that he applies almost every day, if not every day. For instance, Tony believes that in a lowered emotional state, we tend to only see the problems and not solutions. Let\u2019s say you wake up feeling tired and overwhelmed or anxious for whatever reason. You might sit down to brainstorm strategies to solve your issues, but it comes to naught, and you feel even worse afterward. Why? Because you started in a negative state. So, you went from state to then strategy. And in this particular case, you attempted strategy, but you didn\u2019t succeed due to the tunnel vision on the problems. And then you likely told yourself self-defeating stories. All right. So, you went state, strategy, stories. For instance, I always do this. Why am I so wound up that I can\u2019t even think straight? To get the first piece of this chain set up properly, the state, Tony encourages you to prime your state, so he calls this state priming. And priming my state, personally, is often as simple as doing five to ten pushups, ideally with ring turnout on rings or on parallettes, or getting, say, 20 minutes of sun exposure first thing, which is what legendary music producer Rick Rubin did to completely jumpstart and resurrect his own health, ended up losing more than 100 pounds after that. Even though I do my most intense exercise at night typically, where I have a higher pain tolerance, say, 4:00 to 6:00 or 7:00 before dinner, I\u2019ve started doing one to two minutes, in some cases at the very most, of calisthenics or kettlebell swings in the morning to set my state for the day. You can also use cold exposure and so. So, here\u2019s more on Tony\u2019s specific morning routine and his priming approach. What are some of your daily routines? For instance, what do you typically eat for breakfast, if it\u2019s up to you? Tony Robbins: Yeah, I\u2019m boring as hell because I just know it\u2019s fuel. Now, before I met my wife \u2013 we\u2019ve been together more than 15 years \u2013 I was completely anal. Like, I hadn\u2019t had chocolate, I hadn\u2019t had ice cream in 15 years, right? I was just crazy. And then she came into my life, and I\u2019ll never forget. I thought, \u201cGod, this woman\u2019s incredible. She\u2019s a phlebotomist, you know, she does the blood, she\u2019s an acupuncturist, she\u2019s a nutritionist. We\u2019re having these green drinks, and we have this lunch. And afterwards, she ordered a hot fudge sundae. And I thought, \u201cWhat in the hell are you doing?\u201d She goes, \u201cLiving, you bastard.\u201d So, she loosened my ass up just a bit, which is great because I loved her. So, she calls it zigging and zagging. We zig, zig, zig, and then she zags, or we zag. And when I was first with her, we were traveling through Europe, you know, Rome and Italy and various parts of France, South of France, and I was, like, \u201cYou know, you seem to be zagging every day.\u201d And she goes, \u201cWell, I\u2019m on vacation.\u201d And then, later on, we were traveling. I said, \u201cYou know what the problem is? We\u2019re always traveling, so you\u2019re always on vacation.\u201d But she\u2019s thin as hell and in great shape. But I\u2019m a high-grains, protein type of guy, very low carbs. But my regimen is I start with something to strengthen and jolt my nervous system every frigging day. I will sometimes ease into it. I\u2019ll go in the hot pools, and I\u2019m fortunate to have multiple homes. My home in Sun Valley, I have natural hot pools that come out of the ground, just steaming hot, and I go in the hot pools. And then I go there in the river. Here, I go in a 57-degree plunge pool that I have, and I have one in every home I have, every [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: And this\u2019ll be immediately upon waking up? Tony Robbins: Waking up \u2212 Tim Ferriss: Got it. Tony Robbins: \u2212 because it\u2019s just like, boom, every cell in the body wakes up. And it\u2019s also just like training my nervous system to rock, that there is \u2013 no, I don\u2019t give a shit how you feel; this is how you perform. That\u2019s what you do. Even when I\u2019m taking vacation, I do it. It\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 now, I like it. I like that simple discipline that reminds me that level of strength and intensity that\u2019s available. Any moment, even if I\u2019m relaxing, I can bring that up at will. It\u2019s myelin. I also have a cryotherapy unit in all my homes. Have you tried cryotherapy? Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t. Tony Robbins: Do you know what it is? Tim Ferriss: Maybe you can elaborate. I mean, I can put the two words together and probably guess. Tony Robbins: Oh, my God. With all that you do, you\u2019re going to love this. I\u2019m surprised. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m teaching Tim Ferriss something for the first time. [Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve done ice baths though, not the first time. Tony Robbins: Oh, ice baths suck. Ice baths suck. Trust me. I\u2019m on stage on the weekend. I do my Unleash the Power Within program two days. It\u2019s 50\u00a0hours. You haven\u2019t been to an event. You\u2019ve got to come as my guest to an event sometime. Tim Ferriss: I would love to. Tony Robbins: But I\u2019m going to give you an idea. People won\u2019t sit for a three-hour movie that somebody spent $300 million on, and I got Usher or Oprah going, \u201cYou know, Tony, I love you, but two hours is the most I could do.\u201d And 12 hours, Oprah\u2019s standing on a chair, going, \u201cThis is the most incredible experience of my life on camera,\u201d and Usher\u2019s, like, \u201cDude, I\u2019m in for all three days.\u201d But, for me, one of those days alone, I wear an odometer and a Fitbit, and it\u2019s 26.5 miles on average. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Tony Robbins: We start at 8:30 in the morning. I finish at 1:30 or 2:00. There\u2019s one, one-hour break. People can vote with their feet. No one leaves. There\u2019s, on average, 20 minutes of just crazy-ass standing ovations, music, stuff that happens at the end because people are just \u2013 it\u2019s like a rock concert. It\u2019s so much fun. But the wear-and-tear of doing basically marathon after marathon after marathon on the weekend, back to back, is pretty intense. And so, over the years, the inflammation in my body, the demands, I do everything I can to reduce it. Nothing has come close to cryotherapy. Cryotherapy was developed in Poland and Eastern Germany and the Eastern Bloc countries. And what it does is it uses nitrogen, so there\u2019s no water. And unlike an ice bath, which you do, you know, you get spasms, and you\u2019ve got to do them still, right, if you\u2019re a boxer or you\u2019re a runner or you\u2019re an athlete, which is what I would do before, hated them. There\u2019s none of that process, but it reduces your body temperature to minus-220 Fahrenheit. And you do it three minutes, and it\u2019s mind-boggling. In fact, I have one here, and I\u2019ll throw you in at the end, if you want, and you\u2019ll get an experience. Tim Ferriss: I would love to. That\u2019d be great. Tony Robbins: You\u2019ll love it. I have a unit here. I\u2019ll do it for you. But what it does is \u2013 and I do it about three times a week usually. When I come back from an event, I do it a couple days in a row. And what it does is it takes all the inflammation out of your body, and you know what inflammation does to every aspect of the body and the breakdown. But it also \u2013 it sends emergency signals to your brain. It\u2019s like resetting your neurological system because your brain\u2019s going, \u201cYou\u2019re going to freeze to death.\u201d It sounds horrific. It really isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll find out it\u2019s not that painful. Going in my cold plunge of 57\u00a0degrees feels more jolting than this does, even though it\u2019s colder because the fluid of water, versus the nitrogen around you is different. Tim Ferriss: Right, the connectivity. Tony Robbins: The connectivity, exactly right. But what happens is your nervous system gets a signal, so it\u2019s like everything in your body connects because it\u2019s like emergency, every part. It\u2019s a reset of your nervous system. You get an explosion of endorphins in your body, which is really cool, so you get this natural high. You feel this physiological transformation, and you get the reduction of inflammation. What it was used for originally is for people with arthritis, and I found my first one because my mother-in-law would be calling up, and she was just crying in pain, and no medication was enough for her, and I hate somebody medicated anyway. And so, I started doing all this research, and it just started to come to the US. And now, the LA Lakers and most football teams, it\u2019s spreading like wildfire in most of the sports teams. And so, that\u2019s where it took off. So, I went and got her one, and it took her, I think, three sessions, and she\u2019s out of pain. And now, there\u2019s not a day she\u2019s in pain. Now, most people can\u2019t afford to go buy a unit, but there are local places now that are popping up all over the United States where athletes go, where people go, where people go for rejuvenation. It\u2019s amazing for the skin. But it\u2019s one of the greatest things. I got it for her, so I got it for me, and now, I\u2019m addicted, so I\u2019ve got one in every \u2013 and three minutes. Tim Ferriss: What type of unit? Do you know the actual model or the band that you use? Tony Robbins: Yeah, there\u2019s two of them that are the best out there. Was it Java? Junka, J-U-N-K-A, I think it is. I\u2019ll get it for you when we go downstairs. Tim Ferriss: And I\u2019ll put it in the show notes for those of you who are [inaudible]. Tony Robbins: Yeah, if anybody wants to do it. But, also, if you\u2019re in LA, there\u2019s a place there on \u2013 I\u2019ll give it to you and put it in your notes \u2013 a couple of locations there. There\u2019s some great guys. I\u2019m getting another unit. This is a brand-new home, and I\u2019m building an additional guesthouse and additional sized gym and so forth. I\u2019m getting a unit, though, that\u2019s better. This one, it just goes up to your neck. But I\u2019m getting one that encloses you, a full room. And the reason is about 70 percent of your nerve receptors are from the neck up. So, when you step into one of those, it\u2019s even more powerful. But, other than that, I don\u2019t do much unique or different with my life. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t believe that entirely. Tony Robbins: I\u2019m a nut. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll keep digging. So, you have either the sort of contrast therapy that you mentioned \u2212 Tony Robbins: Yes. Tim Ferriss: \u2212 the hot/cold, the cryotherapy. Tony Robbins: Yes. Tim Ferriss: You have salad and fish. Tony Robbins: Yes. Tim Ferriss: How far after \u2013 so, if you were to kind of spec out the first hour of your day \u2212 Tony Robbins: Well, the first every day, I do the water, I take in the environment, and then the first thing I do before I do anything else in my day is I do what I call priming. And priming, to me, is different than meditating. I\u2019ve never been really a meditator, per se. I know the value of it. But the idea for me of sitting still and having no thoughts, it just didn\u2019t really work out for me. It was just a pain in the ass. And I just thought it\u2019s not natural, right? It\u2019s like that\u2019s where it works. But when I\u2019m in nature, I feel that form of meditation. When I stand on stage, and someone stands up, and my brain, it\u2019s done. I don\u2019t even know what it is, but a person\u2019s suicidal \u2013 I\u2019ve never lost a suicide, for example, in 37 years, knock on wood, doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t someday, but I never have, out of thousands, and we\u2019ve followed up with them. So, it\u2019s like there\u2019s something that comes through me, and it\u2019s quite meditative. It\u2019s like I experience it as a witness afterwards. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful gifts in my life. So, I know that meditation. But, for me, what priming is, if you want to have a prime life, you\u2019ve got to be in a prime state. And weeds grow automatically. I don\u2019t give a damn what it is. My teacher, Jim Rohn, used to say that. And so, what I do is I get up, and I do a very simple process. I do an explosive change in my physiology. I\u2019ve done the water already, right, cold, hot. And then I do it with breath because, as I know you know, all forms of Eastern meditation all understand that the mind is the kite, and the breath is the strength. So, I want to move that kite, I move the breath. So, I have a specific pattern of breathing that I do. I do 30 of these breaths, and I do three sets of 30. And that creates a profound physiological difference in my body. And from that altered state, I usually listen to some music, and I go for \u2013 I promise myself ten minutes, and I usually go 30. Tim Ferriss: And you do that in this room that we\u2019re sitting in or \u2212 Tony Robbins: No, I do it all \u2013 this one room is where I do it. It\u2019s got a great vibe. I\u2019ll do this when I do it at night. I usually will go outside because I love the wind on my face, and I love to take in the elements, and so forth. But I do it in multiple places. I\u2019m on the road. I do it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter what day. I always \u2013 I do not missing priming. The reason is, I\u2019m not \u2013 you don\u2019t get fit by getting a walkie. You don\u2019t get fit by working out for a weekend. You know; you live your life that way. Fitness is because it becomes just part of who you are. So, what I do during that time is I do three simple things, and I do it minimum ten minutes. Three minutes of it is just me getting back inside my body and outside of my head, feeling the earth and body in experience and then feeling totally grateful for three things. And I make sure one of them is something very, very simple, the wind on my face, the reflection of the clouds that I just saw there. But I don\u2019t just think gratitude. It\u2019s like I let gratitude fill my soul because when you\u2019re grateful, as we all know, there\u2019s no anger. It\u2019s impossible to be angry and grateful simultaneously. But when you\u2019re grateful, there is no fear. You can\u2019t be fearful and grateful simultaneously. So, I think it is one of the most important power emotions of life. And, also, to me, there\u2019s nothing worse than an angry rich man or woman, somebody\u2019s who\u2019s got everything, and they\u2019re pissed off. I want to slap them. Tim Ferriss: A surprisingly high number of those. Tony Robbins: Yeah, it is, because they develop a life that\u2019s based on expectation instead of appreciation. Tim Ferriss: Agreed. Tony Robbins: And I tell people, you want to change your life fast? Then trade your expectation for appreciation, and you\u2019ll have a whole new life. So, every day, I anchor that in, and I do it very deeply and emotionally. And then the second three minutes I do is a total focus on feeling presence of God, if you will, however you want to language that for yourself, but this inner presence coming in and feeling that heals everything in my body, my mind, my emotions, my relationships, my finances. I see it as solving anything that needs to be solved. I experience the strengthening of my gratitude, of my joy, of my strength, of my conviction, of my passion, and I just let those things happen spontaneously. And then I focus on celebration and then service because my whole life is about service. That\u2019s what makes me feel alive. So, I flood myself with that, with a breathing pattern that I take that does the opposite, takes the breath down through my body and back up again. And then the last three minutes are me focusing on three things that I\u2019m going to make happen, my three to thrive. And I have some big things that\u2019ll do, and sometimes I\u2019ll do things that are smaller, but I see them, feel them, experience them. So, it\u2019s a really simplistic process. It\u2019s ten minutes, but I come out of it in my power. And it doesn\u2019t matter if had two hours\u2019 sleep. I\u2019m now ready. And I do this even when I have no sleep. That\u2019s how committed I am. And, as I said, I\u2019ve always said there\u2019s no excuse not to do ten minutes. If you don\u2019t have ten minutes, you don\u2019t have a life, and that\u2019s how I got myself to do it. And now that I\u2019ve done it, 20 to 30\u00a0minutes is almost always what it is because it actually feels extraordinary. Tim Ferriss: And where can people learn more about the breathing pattern, or could you describe it briefly? Tony Robbins: I\u2019m putting a link online because I just started to share this just recently, and I\u2019ll get it for you. I don\u2019t know what it is off the top of my head, but it\u2019ll be up shortly, I think, this week. Tim Ferriss: Okay, awesome. And I will also put that in the show notes, guys, so that\u2019s just fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, and you\u2019ll be able to find this episode. I have to ask, what type of music do you usually listen to during? Tony Robbins: I have a variety, but for that meditation, I have one in particular, which is Oneness Meditation that a friend of mine made, who\u2019s from India, that I find really profound. It has no singing in it or anything like that. It\u2019s just the sound of a vibration that\u2019s going on, and I just love it. But that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing currently. In the past, over the years, I\u2019ve used all kinds of different pieces of music. But I don\u2019t use modern music or pop music or rock. I do that to work out, you know, rap. I don\u2019t know. It just feels weird to be doing rap while you\u2019re meditating. But, again, what\u2019s different is I don\u2019t think of it as meditation because I look at it as it\u2019s priming courage, love, joy. It\u2019s priming gratitude. It\u2019s priming strength. It\u2019s priming accomplishment. It\u2019s priming, you know, when I\u2019m doing my gratitude piece, and I\u2019m doing the circle of who\u2019s closest to me and circling that out to everybody I love and sending that energy and healing out to them, as well. So, to me, if you want primetime life, you\u2019ve got to prime daily. Tim Ferriss: Well, I like the term, \u201cpriming,\u201d also because I think that most people who struggle with meditation or even attempt to use meditation are utilizing it for that purpose. They\u2019re doing it first in the morning. And when you said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have ten minutes, you don\u2019t have a life,\u201d it reminded me of something that Russell Simmons said to me, which was, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have 30 minutes to meditate, you need three hours.\u201d And I don\u2019t always do 30\u00a0minutes, but I do meditate in the morning. And it\u2019s been a very consistent pattern among all the people that I\u2019ve interviewed so far in the podcast \u2212 Tony Robbins: Really? Tim Ferriss: \u2212 practically 100 percent. Tony Robbins: Wow, that\u2019s wonderful. Tim Ferriss: And, of course, we\u2019ll get to Ray Dalio, but also a very avid meditator. Tony Robbins: He\u2019s coming with me to India in a couple weeks \u2212 Tim Ferriss: Well, that\u2019ll be an amazing trip, I\u2019m sure. Tony Robbins: \u2212 for a week of this experience. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Tim Ferriss: Wim Hof: Let\u2019s talk about Wim Hof. He\u2019s a Dutch world-record holder who is commonly referred to as the Iceman for his ability to withstand extreme cold. For instance, in 2007, Wim climbed past the Death Zone altitude on Everest wearing nothing but shorts. He\u2019s a bit of a madman. In 2009, he completed a full marathon above the Polar Circle in Finland in temperatures close to minus\u201120 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s minus-4 Fahrenheit. He holds the Guinness World Record for the longest ice bath, now set at one hour and 53 minutes and 12\u00a0seconds. Before I continue, I need to state a very clear warning. You should never, ever, ever do breathing exercises in the water or before training in water. Shallow-water blackouts are common after these types of breathing exercises and can be fatal and often are fatal. So, do not do any of what Wim recommends close to water or in water. Now, with that disclaimer stated very clearly, some of his methods can produce amazing before-and-after effects. After one in-person training session with Wim, I went for my normal 45-second breath-hold or so, to four minutes and 45 seconds with no perceptible side effects. This was a first for me, and this was in Malibu, in fact, at Laird Hamilton\u2019s house, who\u2019s also been interviewed. He\u2019s one of the kings of big-wave surfing. Several months later, while in very deep ketosis, about six millimolars or higher after eight days of fasting \u2212 again, never to be done without medical supervision \u2013 I did the same exercises in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber at 2.4 atmospheres. What was the result? Well, there was a clock outside of the chamber, and I held my breath for \u2013 and I know a lot of people aren\u2019t going to believe this \u2013 seven minutes and 30 seconds before I stopped because I was afraid my brain was going to melt. The power of breathing exercises is amazing to behold, which is why, in part, his methods have become very, very popular. Again, they are or can be as dangerous as they are powerful. Never do this stuff when you are not going to hurt yourself if you pass out. So, do it in a chair or something like that, laying down possibly. Don\u2019t do it while you\u2019re going up an escalator. Don\u2019t do it while you are preparing to go into water or anything like that. So, here we go with more from my conversation with Wim Hof. You have such a fascinating story, and you have a lot of accolades, a lot of records, I think more than 20 world records at this point \u2212 Wim Hof: Yes. Tim Ferriss: \u2212 it seems. What was the first world record that you set? Wim Hof: The first was in Paris, just staying a half-hour immersed in ice. And 12 days later, I repeated the record time and made it an hour in Hollywood actually, yes. Tim Ferriss: And I saw one, also \u2212 I mean, you\u2019ve spent a lot of time in ice baths. And, largely influenced by you and a handful of other people, Tim Noakes, Ray, I\u2019m a huge fan of ice baths, and my fans always complain about it. But I\u2019ve seen you in so many containers full of ice. I saw one where I looks like there was a lot of Chinese or Japanese in the background. What has been the most challenging cold exposure experience that you\u2019ve had, whether it\u2019s for records or anything else? Wim Hof: Maybe losing my sight while I was swimming underneath an ice deck of almost one meter, and I had no goggles on. So, I lost sight at 35\u00a0meters, something like 40 yards. And I lost the hole and, yeah, things like that. Shit happens. It happened over there, right there, the meter ice deck above me. So, yeah, that was some great experience. Another one was losing my way on Mount Everest in shorts at 18,000 feet in a blizzard, like a whiteout. So, things like that happen, yeah, and they are challenging. But then it throws me back to the depth of myself, which is trust and confidence, and I got it. Tim Ferriss: What do you say to yourself in one of those moments? So, I guess, physiologically, did your retinas just freeze, or when you were swimming under the ice deck, in a moment like that when many people would panic, did you panic? If so, what was the mental self-talk when you realized that was happening? Wim Hof: Very interesting. The stress level at that moment is absent, is not there. I\u2019m just dealing with the situation. And it has been shown in the university that our stress levels, the stress hormone levels are able to be raised, lying in bed more than somebody in fear for the first time going into a bungee jump. Tim Ferriss: Oh, doing a bungee jump for the first time. Wim Hof: Yeah, yeah, not me \u2013 because a bungee jump, you are attached \u2013 but very unexpected situations in nature, like a blizzard or swimming beneath ice and losing the hole because your eyesight is gone, things like that, or climbing without gear, steep mountains, and having cramps. And what do you do at that moment? That\u2019s exactly what I learned, how to raise consciously the stress hormone level, purely controlled, and I\u2019m able to deal with the situation at that moment without panicking. And I think that\u2019s one of the crucial findings which could benefit for human mankind as it is very subjected to stress all the time, panicking, having fear, and all that. And I learned in nature how to deal with that. And the cold brought me that science, brought me that knowledge, wisdom actually. Tim Ferriss: And the raising of stress hormones, so controlling something that has long been thought to be part of the autonomous nervous system, something that you have no control over, right? And we\u2019ll get to the breathing because breathing is very interesting since it\u2019s both autonomous, but you can consciously control it and practice different methods. I think it was certainly in the Vice documentary that recently came out, which I recommend to everyone, and I\u2019ll link to it in the show notes, but was it in 2011 that you were injected with some type of virus or bacteria to \u2212 Wim Hof: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: \u2212 see if you could control the immune response? That was at the Dutch \u2013 I\u2019m going to mispronounce this \u2013 the Radboud University? Wim Hof: Exactly, Radboud University in Holland, and the intensive care nuclear science. I underwent an experiment, and they injected me with an endotoxin, with a toxin actually, which is a part of bacteria. And that creates a very dramatic immune response. And as we have no control over the immune response in our body, they thought I was not able to do it as well as expected because nobody showed to be able to suppress the immune response because it is part of the autonomic nervous system. And nobody\u2019s able to do that until now. I showed that I was very able, within a quarter of an hour, instead of hours suffering from uncontrolled shivering, fever, headaches, and all that, I showed within a quarter of an hour, to have control, complete, over the symptoms and also the cytokines, which are the flammatory beings in the blood created by the immune response. And I showed in the blood and by blood results to suppress them dramatically within a quarter. And then they told me, \u201cOkay. But you are an exception that confirms the rule because you have been training so many years. You are the Iceman. You do exceptional features. But nobody is able to do that without that proper training of so many years.\u201d And I told them, \u201cNo, I can train them within ten days.\u201d And then the professor was really challenged because if this group would show to be able within ten days to be able to influence deeply into the autonomic nervous system related to the immune system, then that\u2019s for the first time in the scientific history. But he saw the indication of the possibility, but still thought, \u201cThose guys are not going to be able to do that within ten days.\u201d And you know what? It wasn\u2019t within ten days. It was within four days of training that I made them able to undergo the same experiment. That means the injection of the endotoxin and have them within a quarter of an hour completely control over their immune system, related to the autonomic nervous system. So, they showed 100 percent score of everybody to be able, within a couple of days, to tap into the autonomic nervous system related to the immune system. And, yeah, and the training, about the training prior to it, we had our beers, you know, in the evening, and a lot of music and very relaxed. And their mindset, I said, \u201cHey, guys, probably you guys are the new gladiators. We are going to win the worst war ever, which produced the most casualties, agony, pain, and all that, and that\u2019s the bacteria, that\u2019s the bacilli, that\u2019s the virus, and we\u2019re going to win this war. Are you with me?\u201d That\u2019s the way I talked to them. And so, they had a mindset. So, in the evening, we relaxed, and it was like a hippie movement. But this is a new revolution. In four days\u2019 time, they were able at the fourth day, without prior experience in the cold, they were able to go in shorts by minus-10. That\u2019s about \u2013 I don\u2019t know in Fahrenheit \u2013 Celsius; this is Celsius. I mean, it\u2019s freezing cold. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that\u2019s probably in the 20s, probably \u2212 Wim Hof: Yes, in the 20s. Tim Ferriss: \u2212 below freezing, yeah. Wim Hof: And then, for hours and hours, we were going uphill and up the mountain, and we arrived at the summit after hours, and it was minus-27, minus-27 Celsius. That is more than 20s. It\u2019s probably 10, something like that. And we danced the Harlem Shake up there. Then I knew these guys are ready. In four days\u2019 time, when they will be internalized in the hospital and injected with the endotoxin, they will be able because I feel when somebody is back into its natural state of his or her physiology, and I know how to do that. The cold trained me. The cold is my teacher. Tim Ferriss: And with these subjects, I\u2019m so curious to ask because, I mean, I am certainly not as proficient as you are in any of these techniques, but I\u2019ve enjoyed experimenting over the last ten years and writing about these short experiments, whether it\u2019s related to breath-holding with David Blaine or other aspects. Obviously, you\u2019re a professional, and I am not. But I\u2019d be very curious to hear you perhaps elaborate, for instance, on the first day of training with these subjects in preparation to be injected four days later. Wim Hof: Sure. Tim Ferriss: What did the first day of training look like for them? Wim Hof: Just in the morning at ease at 8:00 without food intake, we do breathing, and they lie on the ground all because that\u2019s the most relaxed pose. And if you are relaxed, you are able to store up, hold a lot more oxygen than when in tension or in posture. So, I say to them, \u201cJust lay down and relax. Now, we are going to begin. Just breathe in deeply and let go, breathe in deeply, let go. Make it a rhythm. Breathe in deeply, let go, not fully out, but fully in, and let go.\u201d And repeat that about 30, 40 times until these indications or symptoms come about, and that means lightheadedness, loose in the body, feeling loose in the body, tingling, contractions. That\u2019s because carbon dioxide goes out, oxygen is roaming freely throughout the body, and the pH levels rise. They are optimized, so they get to their best condition. And that\u2019s proven. That\u2019s proven. And they saw, when we do this, they saw all these results chemically. Then, once you feel positively charged with all these symptoms of lightheadedness, feeling loose, contractions, and tingling in the body, I asked them, \u201cJust breathe in deeply, let go. And now, the last time, breathe in deeply, and let go. \u201cAnd after letting go, after exhalation, stop. Refrain from breathing. There is no need. We\u2019ve got a whole lot of oxygen.\u201d And measurement devices are not able to detect how much. It\u2019s more than 100 percent. That\u2019s my opinion. But devices still are not able to detect that. They only can go up to 100 percent, as they say. But the 100 percent, the body is able to store up more oxygen than measurement devices of now are able to measure. So, then, after one half-minute, then you see that the measurement device shows 100 percent, and then it goes dramatically down afterwards. Tim Ferriss: And you\u2019re using a pulse oximeter, something that you clip on your finger? Wim Hof: Yes, yes, pulse oximeter. So, you need a heartbeat. You have a heartbeat, and you have the saturation of the oxygen inside the blood, so the amount of oxygen. So, after one half-minute, you see with everybody that their saturation of the blood is going down. And you know people with COPD \u2013 that\u2019s lung diseases and all that \u2013 they suffer from real severe COPD when they have 85. We go to 90, to 80, 70, 60, 50. People die at 50 and 40, 40 percent saturation in the blood. We go past. We go even to 30. And then the device, measurement device, the oximeter shuts down. It is not measuring anymore. But we even go past that one. Tim Ferriss: Now, why don\u2019t the subjects pass out at this point? Wim Hof: They don\u2019t pass out because they are alkaline. Tim Ferriss: I see. Wim Hof: Their pH degrees are really perfect at that moment. And instead of a person who is dying, he is very acidic. So, that\u2019s the difference. So, because we are so alkaline, people maybe sometimes are able to pass out, but just two seconds or three seconds because they are out of their conditioned control. But after exercising, they regain not only control in those moments and those situations, they win a new part in the brain. They get very deep in the brain. And it\u2019s all new terrain. It\u2019s like a baby. A baby has no problem with their relax. But there are no metorical neurons to relax yet established. So, we are going to different parts of the brain where the guy or the girl never has been. So, it\u2019s logic that people are able to pass out, but nothing happens because they are alkaline. So, they just wake up and mostly or almost always, they wake up very happy. It\u2019s like a drug experience. But that\u2019s besides of the real effect I\u2019m trying to \u2013 not trying \u2013 which we showed scientifically is to be able to tap into the immune system in all the layers. Those are three layers. And normally, we are not able to get into the second and the third layer. And I say now, we have found a key to the second and the third layer. That means the non-specific immune system and the specific adaptive immune system. And that makes us looking to disease completely different because our ability is so much more. Tim Ferriss: Dr. Dominic D\u2019Agostino: Dom is one of my most popular guests I\u2019ve had on the podcast. You guys ask for more and more and more. You just love him. He\u2019s appeared on the podcast a total of three times, although I recommend people start with the first. Dom is an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine. That\u2019s a mouthful. Much of his work is related to nutritional strategies for peak performers and resilience in extreme environments. For instance, he does a lot of work for the Special Operations communities in developing esters and exogenous ketones that can do things like prevent or mitigate brain damage in hypoxic environments, meaning lack of oxygen, or even extend breath-hold times and oxygen utilization and so on. He\u2019s a very impressive guy. He is a highly legitimate athlete in his own right and built like the Incredible Hulk. In this last segment that we\u2019re going to sample, we get a little into the weeds scientifically, but I know that you can get some great tips from it, so bear with it, and a real understanding of the power of ketosis or at least the ketogenic diet. Most important, his information might save your life. There are certain circumstances within which the ketogenic diet or ketosis can be used as a medical adjunct to, say, improve, in the case of fasting, the resilience of normal cells prior to treatments for cancer, including chemotherapy and so on. It is not intended to be a standalone treatment for cancer, so do not spread that nonsense But, as an adjunct, many people I know who have been diagnosed with cancer have used it, so that instead of being laid out the next day after, say, radiation or chemo, there are able to run five, ten miles in the morning. And his approach to ketosis has certainly changed my life and helped me to recover from very severe symptoms of Lyme disease. There is a lot of diet talk, but the supplements and fasting can be treated as separate tools, so you don\u2019t necessarily need to consume a lot of bacon and heavy cream to get into a ketonic state. Now, for those of you not familiar with his work, here\u2019s a very quick primer: The ketogenic diet is often nicknamed keto. This is a high-fat diet that mimics fasting physiology; in other words, what you do when you starve; you get lost in the woods. You start to break down body fat for fuel. Your brain and body begin to use ketones, which are derived from stored or ingested fat for energy instead of blood sugar, glucose, and that is the state of ketosis. The diet was originally developed for treating epileptic children, believe it or not, but there are many variations, including the Atkins diet, which became very, very popular. You can achieve ketosis through fasting, diet, exogenous ketones \u2013 that means supplemental ketones, which can come in powder or liquid form \u2013 or some combination of all of those. One of the most common questions I get is, how do you know when you\u2019re in ketosis? I don\u2019t think the urinalysis strips, the keto strips are very reliable because, as you become fat-adapted, you excrete fewer of these ketone bodies. And the most reliable way at this point in time is using a device called the Precision Xtra, X-T-R-A, by Abbott, A-B-B-O-T-T. You can buy it on Amazon and other places. This can both measure glucose and blood levels of ketone bodies, specifically beta-hydroxybutyrate. So, you prick your finger, and you feed it into this device. And once you get a readout of 0.5 millimolars, M-M-O-L \u2013 that is the concentration of your blood \u2013 you can consider yourself lightly in ketosis. I tend to feel the most increased mental clarity and so on at 1\u00a0millimolar or higher. Now, here we go with more of Dom\u2019s wisdom. Please enjoy. Let\u2019s define ketosis. What is ketosis? I guess we could talk about nutritional and sort of fasting ketosis. But what is ketosis exactly, and what are ketones? Dom D\u2019Agostino: Okay. I\u2019d kind of like to start out with fasting. Tim Ferriss: Sure, perfect. Dom D\u2019Agostino: So, if we\u2019re on a normal diet, and we stop eating all of a sudden, we will mobilize and use up our stored glycogen, mostly in the liver. And our central nervous system more or less demands that we have a steady fuel supply to our brain. And in the absence of glucose availability, we\u2019ll be depleting our liver glycogen, the insulin levels will be suppressed, and we\u2019ll start mobilizing fatty acids for fuel. But fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids don\u2019t cross the blood-brain barrier very efficiently. The liver, while you\u2019re suppressing the hormone insulin, you\u2019ll upregulate beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. And an accumulation of products from fatty acid oxidation will start forming ketone bodies. And these ketone bodies are \u2013 they\u2019re more or less like water-soluble fat molecules. They\u2019re small molecules that can readily cross the blood-brain barrier and get inside cells, into the mitochondria. And as we fast, within about 24 to 48 hours, we\u2019ll start registering ketones to the level that clinically is defined as being in ketosis \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I was going to ask you about that. Dom D\u2019Agostino: \u2212 which is above the 0.5 millimolar \u2212 Tim Ferriss: Oh, 0.5. Dom D\u2019Agostino: \u2212 typically, yeah. So, a person on a high-carb diet would probably take about 24 to 48 hours to start even getting into mild ketosis. But fasting is the fastest way to get into ketosis And that\u2019s why if you have a child with drug-resistance seizures, and they\u2019re admitted into a place like Johns Hopkins, the old protocol was to fast them. They\u2019re not exactly sure if that\u2019s absolutely necessary with things like more \u2013 ketogenic diets have MCTs and stuff \u2013 but fasting has classically been the fastest way to get into ketosis. So, the ketogenic diet has a macronutrient ratio that\u2019s high in fat, typically 90 to 70. Tim Ferriss: And by macronutrients, we\u2019re referring to protein, fat, carbohydrates? Dom D\u2019Agostino: Yeah, yeah. And maybe ketones could be the fourth macronutrient, maybe, if you talk about exogenous ketones. Tim Ferriss: Right, right. Dom D\u2019Agostino: So, a ketogenic diet has a macronutrient ratio that mimics the metabolic physiology that you have when you\u2019re fasting. So, if you were to take the blood out of someone and do a blood sample of someone on a strict ketogenic diet, it would look like they\u2019re fasting, like they\u2019ve been fasting a few days. That changes your physiology incredibly. Your metabolic physiology changes acutely, and then there\u2019s long-term changes that occur with that, epigenetic changes. We know that beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is a ketone body, can have interesting effects on gene expression. Tim Ferriss: What types of effects? Dom D\u2019Agostino: Well, there was a science paper showing that beta-hydroxybutyrate is an HDAC Class I and Class II inhibitor and can activate genes that play a role in enhancing endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, specifically superoxide dismutase and catalase. So, these mechanisms, when they\u2019re upregulated, it confers protection against the environment. It sort of enhances our cellular defense mechanisms. It enhances the robust kind of protective mechanisms that the cell has that can preserve the genome stability. So, maybe being in a state of ketosis and maintaining that can protect your DNA from damage. So, that\u2019s the implications. Also, anti-inflammatory: So, we published a paper. Our colleagues actually did it at Yale. I developed the diet for them and sent it up to them. It was exogenous ketones. But the paper demonstrated that it activated or prevented the activation of a particular inflammasome that\u2019s linked to age-related chronic diseases. So, it inhibited a specific inhibitory pathway that is really associated with all chronic age-related diseases. And it was independent of the ketones\u2019 effect on metabolism. They did a lot of studies to tease out the mechanism and demonstrated that the effect of it suppressing an inflammatory pathway was completely independent of its metabolic effect. So, we understand that \u2013 when I got into this, I just knew that ketones were an energy metabolite. So, now, we know it\u2019s much more than a metabolite. It\u2019s an HDAC inhibitor. And the pharmaceutical \u2212 Tim Ferriss: How do you spell that? I apologize. HDAC? Dom D\u2019Agostino: Oh, yeah, histone deacetylase inhibitor, so HDAC would be H-D-A-C. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Dom D\u2019Agostino: And then there\u2019s Class I, II, III, I think IV. So, Class I and II HDAC inhibitors are a big, big \u2013 are of big interest to the pharmaceutical industry. So, there are many \u2013 for example, we do a lot of cancer research. There\u2019s a lot of pharmaceutical companies focusing on histone deacetylase inhibitors as targeting specific pathways for cancer therapy. So, you have an endogenous HDAC inhibitor with beta-hydroxybutyrate. Tim Ferriss: And not to interrupt, but just for people who want to keep endogenous and exogenous straight, I\u2019ve always found thinking of exoskeleton as sort of outside, as an indicator of outside. So, if you\u2019re taking \u2013 please correct me if I screw this up in any way, Dom \u2013 but if you\u2019re taking exogenous ketones, that means you are consuming ketones from outside of your body. And endogenous is something you\u2019re producing yourself. Dom D\u2019Agostino: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What was the study that you did on advance lifters as it related to ketosis, and what\u2019s kind of the abstract on that? Dom D\u2019Agostino: Yeah, that\u2019s under review right now. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Dom D\u2019Agostino: And, yeah, I\u2019ll give you kind of the synopsis of it. So, we had 12\u00a0subjects, and these were advanced resistance-trained individuals, meaning that they could squat and deadlift and bend to a certain percentage of their bodyweight, which kind of puts them in the range of the Top 10 percent of lifters out there. Tim Ferriss: What was that percentage, just out of curiosity? Dom D\u2019Agostino: I\u2019ve got to go back. It was some funky number, not like \u2013 it was like 185 percent or 75 percent \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Got it. Dom D\u2019Agostino: \u2212 of their bodyweight squatting for seven reps or eight reps or something like that. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Dom D\u2019Agostino: So, it was pretty \u2013 it would be like me \u2013 let me see \u2013 squatting 425 or something for a set of six or something like that. Tim Ferriss: Okay, yeah, these are very \u2212 Dom D\u2019Agostino: It was pretty significant. Tim Ferriss: \u2212 yeah, significantly advanced trainees. Dom D\u2019Agostino: Yeah. So, yeah, the gist of that is that we did a parallel. The control group was on a Western diet, which is pretty similar to kind of moderate protein, higher in carbohydrates, and moderate fat. And the ketogenic diet had roughly 75 to 80 percent fat, restricted carbohydrates to about 20 to 25 grams per day, and the fat was also supplemented to some extent with MCT oil and coconut oil. And all the subjects, it was two weeks they had to be on the diet and had to confirm ketone levels by blood and urine. And once they did, we only did a two-week adaptation, which is kind of another subject we could talk about, but they adapted for two weeks and then kind of trained the heck out of them. And every workout was done in the lab, in a human performance laboratory. And everything was recorded. The volume was controlled. All the parameters were controlled. Bloodwork was done. And the take-home on it was that I would say strength and performance were maintained and increased, and muscle hypertrophy was seen with a ketogenic diet. And there were similar increases, yeah, in power, in hypertrophy. And the big difference was kind of the overall body composition was more favorable in the ketogenic diet group, meaning they had similar increases in lean body mass, but they lost proportionately more fat. And that\u2019s the study that we completed. It\u2019s under review right now. The first journal kicked it back. So, we went in for another journal and did some follow-up work with it. Tim Ferriss: Now, what is your hypothesis \u2013 or maybe you already know \u2013 but how would you explain the maintenance or even development of hypertrophy and power in the ketogenic group when a lot of people associate, say, insulin with different growth factors and whatnot? And I had a conversation \u2013 I want to say it was with Stephen Phinney \u2013 very short conversation, and I asked him this because I had been in a ketotic state for two or three weeks and had experienced a nontrivial amount of muscle growth, and I was really surprised by it. And he explained in terms that I can\u2019t recall, but how the ketogenic diet might have, I guess, a branched-chain amino acid sparing effect of some type. But is it possible to get very big and powerful on a ketogenic diet? And, if so, what\u2019s the mechanism in the absence of higher spiking insulin levels, if that is the parent anabolic hormone? And I\u2019m not saying it is, but a lot of people view it that way. Dom D\u2019Agostino: Yeah. So, there\u2019s insulin and insulin signaling, right? Certain diet \u2013 when you calorie-restrict a rodent or even humans or any mammal, you will enhance insulin sensitivity, right? So, you will be more sensitive to a given amount of insulin. And I think we\u2019re seeing some of that in the athletes. I mean, exercise itself enhances insulin sensitivity. So, guys that are advanced lifters who\u2019ve been at it for ten years may have a different response to a ketogenic diet than, say, a 15-year-old kid who\u2019s trying to bulk up for football. He would probably not be a good candidate for the ketogenic diet. Your sensitivity to things like IGF-1 and insulin are much higher when you\u2019re younger, in your teenage years especially. So, you could compromise a lot of your potential development and strength if you\u2019re younger and doing that. But the older we get, the less carbohydrate-tolerant we get. So, we lose our ability to kind of process carbs as we get older, and our insulin sensitivity declines. Going back to your question, as it relates to being on a ketogenic diet, we know that ketones are anticatabolic. That\u2019s why we can fast for 40 days. And the ketones have an anticatabolic protein sparing effect. And if our blood is flooded with ketones, we\u2019re less likely to liberate gluconeogenic amino acids from our skeletal muscle for fuel because the ketones can more or less replace glucose as a primary energy substrate to maintain your central nervous system, which is three percent of our body by weight but sucks up 20 or 25\u00a0percent of the energy. It\u2019s a big metabolic engine. So, the ketones kind of drive a lot of that substrate energy need. So, in a situation where you\u2019re at a caloric deficit, I think that\u2019s where ketones can shine, if you\u2019re trying to make weight, if you\u2019re trying to preserve or even increase your performance and strength and alter your body composition. So, I don\u2019t think the ketogenic diet is ideal if your goal is maximum, a purely ketogenic diet. I think there are different \u2013 we have to kind of figure out what ketogenic diet we\u2019re talking about. But I don\u2019t think a purely ketogenic diet, as it\u2019s kind of described in the literature, right, a 90 or 85 percent fat diet, is an ideal diet for growth and repair. The diet that we use in our study is actually a little higher in protein, like 25 percent protein, which is really almost double that used by the Johns Hopkins Group that developed the classical ketogenic diet, and it\u2019s really that protein level is important. So, growing on a classic ketogenic diet would be pretty hard. I mean, kids do it. Their growth rates are a little bit less with these kids that have drug-resistant seizures when they\u2019re put on the diet. But if you simply just do what\u2019s called a modified Atkins, and there\u2019s a lot of literature coming out now on the modified Atkins \u2013 Eric Kossoff at Johns Hopkins, he\u2019s a colleague of mine and more in the clinical realm, and he\u2019s done a lot of work showing that a modified Atkins, which is about 70 percent fat and 20 or 30\u00a0percent protein, has the same sort of ability to metabolically manage seizures. And I think that sort of diet can be used pretty successfully in the performance world and specifically for bodybuilders. I think, with that amount of protein, you would be able to grow muscle for sure. And it\u2019s calories, too, right? I mean, calories are the driver, your caloric intake. If you have a surplus amount of calories, you\u2019re more likely to push insulin up and drive anabolic processes. But a lot of times, people, when they follow a ketogenic diet, because ketones have a really good appetite suppressant effect, they will inadvertently restrict calories and may not even know it after a while and may be losing weight without even trying. And that\u2019s one of the benefits, I guess you could say, of the ketogenic diet. You can lose weight, and you can alter your body composition without necessarily even trying, just through the appetite suppressing effect. Tim Ferriss: Well, there you have it, folks. That is the latest Tim Ferriss Radio Hour featuring some of the experts I\u2019ve spoken to in and across more than 200 episodes \u2013 what? \u2013 of this podcast. That\u2019s crazy.

ferriss show", "this is a tim ferriss radio hour, which is a special edition", "i will come back to that in a second", "as always, it\u2019s my job to deconstruct world-class performers of all different types, to tease out the habits, routines, breakfasts or lack thereof, favorite books, etc., that you can test and apply in your own life", "they come from many different worlds: entrepreneurship, athletics, entertainment, special operations, and so on", "and the goal is tactical-practical, so very specific advice and suggested purchases or otherwise that you can immediately apply", "now, after more than 200 of these conversations, you can start to spot certain patterns", "these are the shared habits, hacks, philosophies, tools, and so on, that are the common threads", "this is very interesting to me and a very common question from you all, for instance", "and this ranges from meditation to fitness to many different domains", "you start to spot the common threads of excellence, even across many different disciplines", "so, these commonalities were the premise of my most recent book and no.\u00a01 new york times bestseller, tools of titans", "so, thank you guys, so much for making that possible, which is a compilation of many of my favorite lessons, routines, tips, and so on, from 100-plus different folks", "these episodes in the tim ferriss radio hour are a concentrated dose of the patterns organized around themes that you guys have requested", "so, in this particular episode, i have gathered some of the best advice from past guests about fitness, nutrition, and for lack of a better term, wellness, although that term bugs me, but it\u2019s a good catchall", "in this episode, i talk to, for instance, retired four-star general stanley mcchrystal, to hear how he explains how he not only survived but thrived on one meal per day for years", "stanley mcchrystal: and i do find that there are certain days your body just says, \u201ceat, and eat right now.\u201d and i used to keep a bin of those hard pretzels in my office in afghanistan, and i\u2019d grab a handful of those", "i also talk to world-famous performance coach, tony robbins, one of my favorites", "of course, i got started reading a lot of his stuff, even as far back as college", "and i ask him to explain his morning discipline and routines", "because your brain\u2019s going, \u201cyou\u2019re going to freeze to death.\u201d it sounds horrific", "it really isn\u2019t", "you\u2019ll find out it\u2019s not that painful", "going in my cold plunge of 57 degrees feels more jolting than this does, even though it\u2019s colder", "then we dig into the habits of dutch world-record holder, adventurer, daredevil, and all-round crazy guy, wim hof, and discuss his ability to control or at least affect \u2013 this is consciously affect \u2013 his supposed autonomous immune system, which is fascinating", "\u201cyou are the iceman", "you do exceptional features, but nobody is able to do that without that proper training of so many years.\u201d and i told him, \u201cno, i can train them within ten days.\u201d and we end the episode by getting down and dirty into the science of ketosis with dr", "dominic d\u2019agostino, also known as dom, as we discuss nutritional strategies for peak performers", "and dom, just in case you don\u2019t know, he can do a weeklong fast and then deadlift 500 pounds for something like ten repetitions in front of his class that he teaches", "so, he\u2019s not only bruce banner, but the incredible hulk", "so, without further ado, let\u2019s get started", "i hope you enjoy this episode of the tim ferriss radio hour", "former defense secretary, robert gates, described stanley mcchrystal as, quote, \u201cperhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat i have ever met,\u201d end quote", "that is high praise certainly and for good reason", "mcchrystal served as commander of the joint special operations command \u2212 shorthand is jsoc; you may have heard of that \u2013 where he was credited with the death of abu musab al-zarqawi, leader of al-qaeda in iraq", "his last assignment was as the commander of all american and coalition forces in afghanistan", "now, we talked about a lot", "we had, i want to say, about a two\u2011hour conversation", "one of the things that stood out was how stan rewards himself with a large dinner at night because he doesn\u2019t handle smaller meals throughout the day very well", "while this might seem odd, it\u2019s actually become a more and more popular approach to diet with the rise of intermittent fasting", "and there are many different varieties of intermittent fasting", "there\u2019s 5:2, where you eat normally for five days of the week, and then for two days, you might eat sub-calorically or even go down to, say, 500 calories, or fast completely, so that would be intermittent fasting on a weekly schedule, which i\u2019ve tested", "then you have, for instance, say, 16 hours of fasting and eight hours of eating, or the opposite, you could 18 and six", "there are many different ways to approach this", "a lot of the male peak performers over the age of 40 that i\u2019ve interviewed skip breakfast, a very high percentage", "this includes wim hof, for instance, who\u2019s coming up later, and many, many others", "there are exceptions, though, who do things slightly differently", "art de vany, who\u2019s worth checking out, he\u2019s older than 80 years of age and shredded, still an athlete, an economist", "and if you haven\u2019t heard his episode, you also should hear that one", "but he does a reasonably sized breakfast, trains a few hours later, and then fasts until dinner", "so, he does breakfast, no lunch, and then dinner", "i have at least recently found this to be more effective for me personally, and particularly on training days", "if i can time it such that i train earlier in the day, i find it particularly effective", "when i skip breakfast, i would say 20 percent of the time or so, i find myself fatigued in the afternoon because i postpone lunch too long", "so, if i\u2019m going to skip breakfast, it\u2019s important a) that i wake up on the earlier side, and b) that i have lunch, say, four to five hours after walking", "otherwise, i tend to have a slump in energy in the afternoon and then to self-medicate with caffeine, exogenous ketones, and all sorts of other things", "so, at the moment, i find that i function best if i am on, say, a weight-training and athletic schedule, meaning i have multiple sessions of movement throughout the week, either breakfast and dinner, skipping lunch, or three meals a day", "and i will do my intermittent fasting in a slightly different way, and i do think the term, intermittent fasting, is used so often to have almost become meaningless", "but i like to do a contiguous three-day fast each month, generally thursday dinner to sunday dinner, and that should be medically supervised", "and this is largely at the recommendation or based on my conversations with dom d\u2019agostino, which comes up later", "now, before i get too ahead of myself, let\u2019s listen to mcchrystal\u2019s specific approach", "i have a slew of questions, but the one that i have been asked to ask you, stan, more than perhaps any other is, why one meal a day", "do you actually eat one meal a day", "stanley mcchrystal: i do, and people ask me why", "is it some zen connection with something", "and, no", "what happened was when i was a lieutenant in special forces many, many years ago, i thought i was getting fat, and i started running", "and i started running distanced, which i enjoyed", "but i also found that my personality was such that i\u2019m not real good at eating three or four small, disciplined meals", "i\u2019m better to defer gratification and then eat one meal, and for me, that\u2019s dinner", "and so, what i do is i sort of push myself hard all day, try to get everything done, and then sort of reward myself with dinner at night", "what time do you usually eat dinner", "stanley mcchrystal: well, whenever i\u2019m finished work, and it would be 8:00 or 8:30", "there\u2019s a challenge when you work really long hours because, suddenly, you start to eat very late, and then you go directly to bed, and you feel like you\u2019re sleeping with a football on your stomach", "and do you drink coffee earlier in the day", "i\u2019m just thinking, with the workout and that many hours, a lot of people would fade", "how do you prevent yourself from fading", "stanley mcchrystal: yeah, i have a tendency, i\u2019ll drink coffee", "i\u2019ll drink other beverages, too, water and different things", "and i do find that there are certain days your body just says, \u201ceat, and eat right now.\u201d and i used to keep a bin of those hard pretzels in my office in afghanistan, and i\u2019d grab a handful of those", "and other times, i might be out doing something physical in the military, like road marching, and suddenly, your body communicates, \u201ceat pretty quickly, or you won\u2019t keep road marching,\u201d and i\u2019ll do that", "but, otherwise, i like to stick to the idea of one a night", "got it", "yeah, this is a constant topic of conversation in the intermittent fasting world, and everyone has \u2212 ori hofmekler has his thing; the paleo guys have their thoughts obviously", "chris, are you a one-meal-a-day kind of guy", "chris: well, when i was working for then general mcchrystal as his aide-de-camp, his last year running the joint special operations command, it was sort of by directive", "there was no other choice", "that was just what we call the battle rhythm of the organization", "and when the old man got to eat, you did it then, or you didn\u2019t do it at all", "so, yeah, i\u2019ve lived on that train", "but i would be the first to tell others because, as stan alluded to, it sort of became the driver in the organization, this is what we do", "and i would tell people, as his aide, \u201che won\u2019t judge you if you eat breakfast", "this is the way his metabolism works", "he doesn\u2019t do this as a demonstration of personal strength", "this is just what works", "so, don\u2019t think you\u2019re impressing him by not eating lunch or whatever.\u201d but there was a classic story around this when i first joined the inner-circle staff", "we had this command sergeant major, who i\u2019ll call jody, a legend in the community", "he had been with stan for about three and a half years at that point", "and so, i was asking him about the one-meal-a-day thing, and he said, when he showed up, for the first year \u2013 he\u2019s two feet from stan for the entire five years they worked together \u2013 and he said, \u201cwell, this is what the boss does", "this is what i\u2019ll do.\u201d so, he did a meal a day, and he does not have the metabolism that [inaudible]", "and we lived in these little, crummy, sort of quonset huts next to where the headquarters was", "did you say quonset huts", "chris: just sort of wooden huts \u2013 right", "chris: \u2212 pretty spartan living, about 50 yards from where the headquarters was in iraq", "and jody said, about a year into the tour, that general mcchrystal calls him and says, \u201cjody, get in here.\u201d so, he runs over", "\u201cwhat\u2019s up, sir?\u201d and he said, \u201ci hadn\u2019t really looked through his hooch before.\u201d and he said, \u201cgeneral mcchrystal\u2019s pointing at this little tin of pretzels he has, and he goes, \u2018i think there\u2019s mice eating my pretzels.'\u201d and jody said, \u201ci almost whipped out my gun and shot him.\u201d and i said, \u201cyou\u2019ve been eating pretzels", "i\u2019ve been eating one meal a day \u2013\u201d dark secret", "chris: \u201c\u2212 for a year, and you have pretzels in your room.\u201d he goes, \u201cit was the most unprofessional i\u2019ve ever been with a general officer", "i just stormed out of the room.\u201d you know, low blood sugar will do that", "chris: that was so funny", "makes cowards of men, long-distance running and low blood sugar", "working out \u2013 do you work out every day", "stanley mcchrystal: i do", "what type of exercise, and why", "stanley mcchrystal: when i was younger and i got serious about working out, i was a second lieutenant, and as i mentioned, i started getting fat", "and i had a first sergeant in my parachute infantry company that liked to run", "so, we would do loosening-up exercises, and then we\u2019d run", "and so, i started running, and so, for the first 20 or so years, i ran", "i had one period when i was a captain when i ran 15 miles a day, seven days a week, didn\u2019t vary, didn\u2019t take days off, wore lousy running shoes", "it was sort of stereotypically all the mistakes you can make", "as i got older and i started to have a series of shoulder surgeries and back surgeries predictably, what i learned to do was to alternate", "so, i will run one day, i will lift weight the next day, i\u2019ll bike when i\u2019m home and have that capability, so i can round out", "but, for me, it\u2019s very important to do something literally every day", "i\u2019ll only take a day off when i\u2019m forced to because i\u2019ve got some weird schedule thing that makes it impossible", "and what does your weight training, your resistance training workout look like", "stanley mcchrystal: yeah, i will start at my home, if we\u2019re at home, and i go down to my basement, and i do four sets of pushups, as many as i can do for four sets", "and i alternate that with a series of abs exercises", "so, i\u2019ll do, starting with a set of sit-ups, and i\u2019ll do 100 sit-ups", "and i\u2019ll flip over, and i\u2019ll do three minutes of a plank", "and then i\u2019ll do some yoga that i learned for about two or three minutes", "then i\u2019ll do another set of pushups", "then i\u2019ll go to my next abs thing, which is a crunch-like crossover", "then i\u2019ll do a two-and-a-half-minute plank", "and then i\u2019ll do more yoga, slightly different", "then i\u2019ll do another set of pushups, and then i\u2019ll do my third set, which is crossover sit-ups", "and i\u2019ll then do a third plank of two minutes", "i\u2019m decreasing each time", "then i\u2019ll do some more yoga", "and then i\u2019ll do my fourth set of pushups", "and then i\u2019ll do my fourth, which is a flutter kick, 60 flutter kicks, followed by a static", "then i\u2019ll do my fourth plank, which is now a minute and a half", "and then i\u2019ll come back", "i only do four sets of pushups, so the last time, i don\u2019t do pushups", "i then do one more set of the crunch-like, and i\u2019ll flip over, do my last plank, which is one minute", "and then i\u2019ll do some final yoga", "and that\u2019ll take me about 45 to 50 minutes", "then i\u2019ll leave my house and go to the gym because my gym opens at 5:30", "it\u2019s three blocks from my house", "i assume we mean a.m", "stanley mcchrystal: yeah", "so, i can do all this from 4:30 \u2013 if i get up at 4:00, i can do all that from 4:30 to about 5:20, 5:25, go down to my gym", "and then when i get to the gym, i do four sets of pullups, alternated with incline bench press, alternated with standing curls", "and then, in that, i\u2019ll also do these one-legged things, balance exercises, as the break between them", "i was taught that was good for balance and whatnot", "and then i\u2019ll do a few other things in there", "and i can do all that in 30, 35 minutes", "so, by 6:15, 6:20, i can be done at the gym, head back home, get cleaned up, and then be starting work", "ready to rock and roll", "stanley mcchrystal: yeah", "and why is exercise important to you, both when you were overseas and at home", "maybe the reasons differ", "but why is that routine, ritual important", "stanley mcchrystal: i think it\u2019s several things", "there\u2019s a certain self-image", "i think that if i was struggling with my weight, or if i was not as fit as i wanted people to perceive me, and i couldn\u2019t perceive myself that way, i think my own self-esteem would suffer", "and particularly, over life now, whenever i\u2019m injured and i have even a slight period, it bothers me a lot, so i think that\u2019s part of it", "second is the military", "there\u2019s an expectation", "if you are not a physical leader in the kind of organizations that chris and i were in, if you can\u2019t do those things physically \u2013 you don\u2019t have to do it better than everybody else, but you have to do it credibly, and they can look up to \u2013 then i think your status in the organization is going to go down", "when i left ranger battalion command in 1996, and i went off to spend a year at harvard, and i remember one of my non-commissioned officers said, \u201csir, what are you going to do at harvard?\u201d i said, \u201ci\u2019m going to study.\u201d he says, \u201cyou going to work out?\u201d and i said, \u201cyeah, presumably, i will.\u201d and he goes, \u201cyou know, you come back here with a phd, but you\u2019re out of shape, we\u2019re going to have a word for you, and it ain\u2019t gonna be doctor.\u201d and i just thought that was so good", "it also puts a discipline in the day", "i find that, if the day is terrible or whatever, but i worked out, at the end of the day, i can go, \u201cwell, i had a good workout,\u201d almost no matter what happens", "when the rolling stone article came out, it came out about 1:30 in the morning, i found out about it", "i made a couple calls", "i knew we had a big problem", "and i went and put my clothes on, and i ran for an hour, clear my head, destress myself, didn\u2019t make it go away, but that was something that i\u2019d do in those situations", "not long ago, i flew to florida to interview peak performance coach, tony robbins, who has long been someone i\u2019ve looked up to and learned a lot from", "he\u2019s very good at getting people to not only hear advice, but take action on that advice", "now, aside from asking him to palm my face with his massive hands \u2212 that was actually the very first instagram photo i ever put up, which you can check out on instagram, timferriss with two rs and two ss, if you want to see a picture of his ginormous hands covering my entire head \u2013 but, besides that, he allowed me to dive really deep into the various routines and frameworks that he applies almost every day, if not every day", "for instance, tony believes that in a lowered emotional state, we tend to only see the problems and not solutions", "let\u2019s say you wake up feeling tired and overwhelmed or anxious for whatever reason", "you might sit down to brainstorm strategies to solve your issues, but it comes to naught, and you feel even worse afterward", "why", "because you started in a negative state", "so, you went from state to then strategy", "and in this particular case, you attempted strategy, but you didn\u2019t succeed due to the tunnel vision on the problems", "and then you likely told yourself self-defeating stories", "all right", "so, you went state, strategy, stories", "for instance, i always do this", "why am i so wound up that i can\u2019t even think straight", "to get the first piece of this chain set up properly, the state, tony encourages you to prime your state, so he calls this state priming", "and priming my state, personally, is often as simple as doing five to ten pushups, ideally with ring turnout on rings or on parallettes, or getting, say, 20 minutes of sun exposure first thing, which is what legendary music producer rick rubin did to completely jumpstart and resurrect his own health, ended up losing more than 100 pounds after that", "even though i do my most intense exercise at night typically, where i have a higher pain tolerance, say, 4:00 to 6:00 or 7:00 before dinner, i\u2019ve started doing one to two minutes, in some cases at the very most, of calisthenics or kettlebell swings in the morning to set my state for the day", "you can also use cold exposure and so", "so, here\u2019s more on tony\u2019s specific morning routine and his priming approach", "what are some of your daily routines", "for instance, what do you typically eat for breakfast, if it\u2019s up to you", "yeah, i\u2019m boring as hell because i just know it\u2019s fuel", "now, before i met my wife \u2013 we\u2019ve been together more than 15 years \u2013 i was completely anal", "like, i hadn\u2019t had chocolate, i hadn\u2019t had ice cream in 15 years, right", "i was just crazy", "and then she came into my life, and i\u2019ll never forget", "i thought, \u201cgod, this woman\u2019s incredible", "she\u2019s a phlebotomist, you know, she does the blood, she\u2019s an acupuncturist, she\u2019s a nutritionist", "we\u2019re having these green drinks, and we have this lunch", "and afterwards, she ordered a hot fudge sundae", "and i thought, \u201cwhat in the hell are you doing?\u201d she goes, \u201cliving, you bastard.\u201d so, she loosened my ass up just a bit, which is great because i loved her", "so, she calls it zigging and zagging", "we zig, zig, zig, and then she zags, or we zag", "and when i was first with her, we were traveling through europe, you know, rome and italy and various parts of france, south of france, and i was, like, \u201cyou know, you seem to be zagging every day.\u201d and she goes, \u201cwell, i\u2019m on vacation.\u201d and then, later on, we were traveling", "i said, \u201cyou know what the problem is", "we\u2019re always traveling, so you\u2019re always on vacation.\u201d but she\u2019s thin as hell and in great shape", "but i\u2019m a high-grains, protein type of guy, very low carbs", "but my regimen is i start with something to strengthen and jolt my nervous system every frigging day", "i will sometimes ease into it", "i\u2019ll go in the hot pools, and i\u2019m fortunate to have multiple homes", "my home in sun valley, i have natural hot pools that come out of the ground, just steaming hot, and i go in the hot pools", "and then i go there in the river", "here, i go in a 57-degree plunge pool that i have, and i have one in every home i have, every [inaudible]", "and this\u2019ll be immediately upon waking up", "waking up \u2212 got it", "\u2212 because it\u2019s just like, boom, every cell in the body wakes up", "and it\u2019s also just like training my nervous system to rock, that there is \u2013 no, i don\u2019t give a shit how you feel; this is how you perform", "that\u2019s what you do", "even when i\u2019m taking vacation, i do it", "it\u2019s just \u2013 i don\u2019t know \u2013 now, i like it", "i like that simple discipline that reminds me that level of strength and intensity that\u2019s available", "any moment, even if i\u2019m relaxing, i can bring that up at will", "it\u2019s myelin", "i also have a cryotherapy unit in all my homes", "have you tried cryotherapy", "i haven\u2019t", "do you know what it is", "maybe you can elaborate", "i mean, i can put the two words together and probably guess", "oh, my god", "with all that you do, you\u2019re going to love this", "i\u2019m surprised", "i\u2019m glad i\u2019m teaching tim ferriss something for the first time", "[inaudible]", "i\u2019ve done ice baths though, not the first time", "oh, ice baths suck", "ice baths suck", "trust me", "i\u2019m on stage on the weekend", "i do my unleash the power within program two days", "it\u2019s 50\u00a0hours", "you haven\u2019t been to an event", "you\u2019ve got to come as my guest to an event sometime", "i would love to", "but i\u2019m going to give you an idea", "people won\u2019t sit for a three-hour movie that somebody spent $300 million on, and i got usher or oprah going, \u201cyou know, tony, i love you, but two hours is the most i could do.\u201d and 12 hours, oprah\u2019s standing on a chair, going, \u201cthis is the most incredible experience of my life on camera,\u201d and usher\u2019s, like, \u201cdude, i\u2019m in for all three days.\u201d but, for me, one of those days alone, i wear an odometer and a fitbit, and it\u2019s 26.5 miles on average", "wow", "we start at 8:30 in the morning", "i finish at 1:30 or 2:00", "there\u2019s one, one-hour break", "people can vote with their feet", "no one leaves", "there\u2019s, on average, 20 minutes of just crazy-ass standing ovations, music, stuff that happens at the end because people are just \u2013 it\u2019s like a rock concert", "it\u2019s so much fun", "but the wear-and-tear of doing basically marathon after marathon after marathon on the weekend, back to back, is pretty intense", "and so, over the years, the inflammation in my body, the demands, i do everything i can to reduce it", "nothing has come close to cryotherapy", "cryotherapy was developed in poland and eastern germany and the eastern bloc countries", "and what it does is it uses nitrogen, so there\u2019s no water", "and unlike an ice bath, which you do, you know, you get spasms, and you\u2019ve got to do them still, right, if you\u2019re a boxer or you\u2019re a runner or you\u2019re an athlete, which is what i would do before, hated them", "there\u2019s none of that process, but it reduces your body temperature to minus-220 fahrenheit", "and you do it three minutes, and it\u2019s mind-boggling", "in fact, i have one here, and i\u2019ll throw you in at the end, if you want, and you\u2019ll get an experience", "i would love to", "that\u2019d be great", "you\u2019ll love it", "i have a unit here", "i\u2019ll do it for you", "but what it does is \u2013 and i do it about three times a week usually", "when i come back from an event, i do it a couple days in a row", "and what it does is it takes all the inflammation out of your body, and you know what inflammation does to every aspect of the body and the breakdown", "but it also \u2013 it sends emergency signals to your brain", "it\u2019s like resetting your neurological system because your brain\u2019s going, \u201cyou\u2019re going to freeze to death.\u201d it sounds horrific", "it really isn\u2019t", "you\u2019ll find out it\u2019s not that painful", "going in my cold plunge of 57\u00a0degrees feels more jolting than this does, even though it\u2019s colder because the fluid of water, versus the nitrogen around you is different", "right, the connectivity", "the connectivity, exactly right", "but what happens is your nervous system gets a signal, so it\u2019s like everything in your body connects because it\u2019s like emergency, every part", "it\u2019s a reset of your nervous system", "you get an explosion of endorphins in your body, which is really cool, so you get this natural high", "you feel this physiological transformation, and you get the reduction of inflammation", "what it was used for originally is for people with arthritis, and i found my first one because my mother-in-law would be calling up, and she was just crying in pain, and no medication was enough for her, and i hate somebody medicated anyway", "and so, i started doing all this research, and it just started to come to the us", "and now, the la lakers and most football teams, it\u2019s spreading like wildfire in most of the sports teams", "and so, that\u2019s where it took off", "so, i went and got her one, and it took her, i think, three sessions, and she\u2019s out of pain", "and now, there\u2019s not a day she\u2019s in pain", "now, most people can\u2019t afford to go buy a unit, but there are local places now that are popping up all over the united states where athletes go, where people go, where people go for rejuvenation", "it\u2019s amazing for the skin", "but it\u2019s one of the greatest things", "i got it for her, so i got it for me, and now, i\u2019m addicted, so i\u2019ve got one in every \u2013 and three minutes", "what type of unit", "do you know the actual model or the band that you use", "yeah, there\u2019s two of them that are the best out there", "was it java", "junka, j-u-n-k-a, i think it is", "i\u2019ll get it for you when we go downstairs", "and i\u2019ll put it in the show notes for those of you who are [inaudible]", "yeah, if anybody wants to do it", "but, also, if you\u2019re in la, there\u2019s a place there on \u2013 i\u2019ll give it to you and put it in your notes \u2013 a couple of locations there", "there\u2019s some great guys", "i\u2019m getting another unit", "this is a brand-new home, and i\u2019m building an additional guesthouse and additional sized gym and so forth", "i\u2019m getting a unit, though, that\u2019s better", "this one, it just goes up to your neck", "but i\u2019m getting one that encloses you, a full room", "and the reason is about 70 percent of your nerve receptors are from the neck up", "so, when you step into one of those, it\u2019s even more powerful", "but, other than that, i don\u2019t do much unique or different with my life", "i don\u2019t believe that entirely", "i\u2019m a nut", "i\u2019ll keep digging", "so, you have either the sort of contrast therapy that you mentioned \u2212 yes", "\u2212 the hot/cold, the cryotherapy", "yes", "you have salad and fish", "yes", "how far after \u2013 so, if you were to kind of spec out the first hour of your day \u2212 well, the first every day, i do the water, i take in the environment, and then the first thing i do before i do anything else in my day is i do what i call priming", "and priming, to me, is different than meditating", "i\u2019ve never been really a meditator, per se", "i know the value of it", "but the idea for me of sitting still and having no thoughts, it just didn\u2019t really work out for me", "it was just a pain in the ass", "and i just thought it\u2019s not natural, right", "it\u2019s like that\u2019s where it works", "but when i\u2019m in nature, i feel that form of meditation", "when i stand on stage, and someone stands up, and my brain, it\u2019s done", "i don\u2019t even know what it is, but a person\u2019s suicidal \u2013 i\u2019ve never lost a suicide, for example, in 37 years, knock on wood, doesn\u2019t mean i won\u2019t someday, but i never have, out of thousands, and we\u2019ve followed up with them", "so, it\u2019s like there\u2019s something that comes through me, and it\u2019s quite meditative", "it\u2019s like i experience it as a witness afterwards", "it\u2019s one of the most beautiful gifts in my life", "so, i know that meditation", "but, for me, what priming is, if you want to have a prime life, you\u2019ve got to be in a prime state", "and weeds grow automatically", "i don\u2019t give a damn what it is", "my teacher, jim rohn, used to say that", "and so, what i do is i get up, and i do a very simple process", "i do an explosive change in my physiology", "i\u2019ve done the water already, right, cold, hot", "and then i do it with breath because, as i know you know, all forms of eastern meditation all understand that the mind is the kite, and the breath is the strength", "so, i want to move that kite, i move the breath", "so, i have a specific pattern of breathing that i do", "i do 30 of these breaths, and i do three sets of 30", "and that creates a profound physiological difference in my body", "and from that altered state, i usually listen to some music, and i go for \u2013 i promise myself ten minutes, and i usually go 30", "and you do that in this room that we\u2019re sitting in or \u2212 no, i do it all \u2013 this one room is where i do it", "it\u2019s got a great vibe", "i\u2019ll do this when i do it at night", "i usually will go outside because i love the wind on my face, and i love to take in the elements, and so forth", "but i do it in multiple places", "i\u2019m on the road", "i do it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter what day", "i always \u2013 i do not missing priming", "the reason is, i\u2019m not \u2013 you don\u2019t get fit by getting a walkie", "you don\u2019t get fit by working out for a weekend", "you know; you live your life that way", "fitness is because it becomes just part of who you are", "so, what i do during that time is i do three simple things, and i do it minimum ten minutes", "three minutes of it is just me getting back inside my body and outside of my head, feeling the earth and body in experience and then feeling totally grateful for three things", "and i make sure one of them is something very, very simple, the wind on my face, the reflection of the clouds that i just saw there", "but i don\u2019t just think gratitude", "it\u2019s like i let gratitude fill my soul because when you\u2019re grateful, as we all know, there\u2019s no anger", "it\u2019s impossible to be angry and grateful simultaneously", "but when you\u2019re grateful, there is no fear", "you can\u2019t be fearful and grateful simultaneously", "so, i think it is one of the most important power emotions of life", "and, also, to me, there\u2019s nothing worse than an angry rich man or woman, somebody\u2019s who\u2019s got everything, and they\u2019re pissed off", "i want to slap them", "a surprisingly high number of those", "yeah, it is, because they develop a life that\u2019s based on expectation instead of appreciation", "agreed", "and i tell people, you want to change your life fast", "then trade your expectation for appreciation, and you\u2019ll have a whole new life", "so, every day, i anchor that in, and i do it very deeply and emotionally", "and then the second three minutes i do is a total focus on feeling presence of god, if you will, however you want to language that for yourself, but this inner presence coming in and feeling that heals everything in my body, my mind, my emotions, my relationships, my finances", "i see it as solving anything that needs to be solved", "i experience the strengthening of my gratitude, of my joy, of my strength, of my conviction, of my passion, and i just let those things happen spontaneously", "and then i focus on celebration and then service because my whole life is about service", "that\u2019s what makes me feel alive", "so, i flood myself with that, with a breathing pattern that i take that does the opposite, takes the breath down through my body and back up again", "and then the last three minutes are me focusing on three things that i\u2019m going to make happen, my three to thrive", "and i have some big things that\u2019ll do, and sometimes i\u2019ll do things that are smaller, but i see them, feel them, experience them", "so, it\u2019s a really simplistic process", "it\u2019s ten minutes, but i come out of it in my power", "and it doesn\u2019t matter if had two hours\u2019 sleep", "i\u2019m now ready", "and i do this even when i have no sleep", "that\u2019s how committed i am", "and, as i said, i\u2019ve always said there\u2019s no excuse not to do ten minutes", "if you don\u2019t have ten minutes, you don\u2019t have a life, and that\u2019s how i got myself to do it", "and now that i\u2019ve done it, 20 to 30\u00a0minutes is almost always what it is because it actually feels extraordinary", "and where can people learn more about the breathing pattern, or could you describe it briefly", "i\u2019m putting a link online because i just started to share this just recently, and i\u2019ll get it for you", "i don\u2019t know what it is off the top of my head, but it\u2019ll be up shortly, i think, this week", "okay, awesome", "and i will also put that in the show notes, guys, so that\u2019s just fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, and you\u2019ll be able to find this episode", "i have to ask, what type of music do you usually listen to during", "i have a variety, but for that meditation, i have one in particular, which is oneness meditation that a friend of mine made, who\u2019s from india, that i find really profound", "it has no singing in it or anything like that", "it\u2019s just the sound of a vibration that\u2019s going on, and i just love it", "but that\u2019s what i\u2019m doing currently", "in the past, over the years, i\u2019ve used all kinds of different pieces of music", "but i don\u2019t use modern music or pop music or rock", "i do that to work out, you know, rap", "i don\u2019t know", "it just feels weird to be doing rap while you\u2019re meditating", "but, again, what\u2019s different is i don\u2019t think of it as meditation because i look at it as it\u2019s priming courage, love, joy", "it\u2019s priming gratitude", "it\u2019s priming strength", "it\u2019s priming accomplishment", "it\u2019s priming, you know, when i\u2019m doing my gratitude piece, and i\u2019m doing the circle of who\u2019s closest to me and circling that out to everybody i love and sending that energy and healing out to them, as well", "so, to me, if you want primetime life, you\u2019ve got to prime daily", "well, i like the term, \u201cpriming,\u201d also because i think that most people who struggle with meditation or even attempt to use meditation are utilizing it for that purpose", "they\u2019re doing it first in the morning", "and when you said, \u201cif you don\u2019t have ten minutes, you don\u2019t have a life,\u201d it reminded me of something that russell simmons said to me, which was, \u201cif you don\u2019t have 30 minutes to meditate, you need three hours.\u201d and i don\u2019t always do 30\u00a0minutes, but i do meditate in the morning", "and it\u2019s been a very consistent pattern among all the people that i\u2019ve interviewed so far in the podcast \u2212 really", "\u2212 practically 100 percent", "wow, that\u2019s wonderful", "and, of course, we\u2019ll get to ray dalio, but also a very avid meditator", "he\u2019s coming with me to india in a couple weeks \u2212 well, that\u2019ll be an amazing trip, i\u2019m sure", "\u2212 for a week of this experience", "oh, amazing", "let\u2019s talk about wim hof", "he\u2019s a dutch world-record holder who is commonly referred to as the iceman for his ability to withstand extreme cold", "for instance, in 2007, wim climbed past the death zone altitude on everest wearing nothing but shorts", "he\u2019s a bit of a madman", "in 2009, he completed a full marathon above the polar circle in finland in temperatures close to minus\u201120 degrees celsius", "that\u2019s minus-4 fahrenheit", "he holds the guinness world record for the longest ice bath, now set at one hour and 53 minutes and 12\u00a0seconds", "before i continue, i need to state a very clear warning", "you should never, ever, ever do breathing exercises in the water or before training in water", "shallow-water blackouts are common after these types of breathing exercises and can be fatal and often are fatal", "so, do not do any of what wim recommends close to water or in water", "now, with that disclaimer stated very clearly, some of his methods can produce amazing before-and-after effects", "after one in-person training session with wim, i went for my normal 45-second breath-hold or so, to four minutes and 45 seconds with no perceptible side effects", "this was a first for me, and this was in malibu, in fact, at laird hamilton\u2019s house, who\u2019s also been interviewed", "he\u2019s one of the kings of big-wave surfing", "several months later, while in very deep ketosis, about six millimolars or higher after eight days of fasting \u2212 again, never to be done without medical supervision \u2013 i did the same exercises in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber at 2.4 atmospheres", "what was the result", "well, there was a clock outside of the chamber, and i held my breath for \u2013 and i know a lot of people aren\u2019t going to believe this \u2013 seven minutes and 30 seconds before i stopped because i was afraid my brain was going to melt", "the power of breathing exercises is amazing to behold, which is why, in part, his methods have become very, very popular", "again, they are or can be as dangerous as they are powerful", "never do this stuff when you are not going to hurt yourself if you pass out", "so, do it in a chair or something like that, laying down possibly", "don\u2019t do it while you\u2019re going up an escalator", "don\u2019t do it while you are preparing to go into water or anything like that", "so, here we go with more from my conversation with wim hof", "you have such a fascinating story, and you have a lot of accolades, a lot of records, i think more than 20 world records at this point \u2212 yes", "\u2212 it seems", "what was the first world record that you set", "the first was in paris, just staying a half-hour immersed in ice", "and 12 days later, i repeated the record time and made it an hour in hollywood actually, yes", "and i saw one, also \u2212 i mean, you\u2019ve spent a lot of time in ice baths", "and, largely influenced by you and a handful of other people, tim noakes, ray, i\u2019m a huge fan of ice baths, and my fans always complain about it", "but i\u2019ve seen you in so many containers full of ice", "i saw one where i looks like there was a lot of chinese or japanese in the background", "what has been the most challenging cold exposure experience that you\u2019ve had, whether it\u2019s for records or anything else", "maybe losing my sight while i was swimming underneath an ice deck of almost one meter, and i had no goggles on", "so, i lost sight at 35\u00a0meters, something like 40 yards", "and i lost the hole and, yeah, things like that", "shit happens", "it happened over there, right there, the meter ice deck above me", "so, yeah, that was some great experience", "another one was losing my way on mount everest in shorts at 18,000 feet in a blizzard, like a whiteout", "so, things like that happen, yeah, and they are challenging", "but then it throws me back to the depth of myself, which is trust and confidence, and i got it", "what do you say to yourself in one of those moments", "so, i guess, physiologically, did your retinas just freeze, or when you were swimming under the ice deck, in a moment like that when many people would panic, did you panic", "if so, what was the mental self-talk when you realized that was happening", "very interesting", "the stress level at that moment is absent, is not there", "i\u2019m just dealing with the situation", "and it has been shown in the university that our stress levels, the stress hormone levels are able to be raised, lying in bed more than somebody in fear for the first time going into a bungee jump", "oh, doing a bungee jump for the first time", "yeah, yeah, not me \u2013 because a bungee jump, you are attached \u2013 but very unexpected situations in nature, like a blizzard or swimming beneath ice and losing the hole because your eyesight is gone, things like that, or climbing without gear, steep mountains, and having cramps", "and what do you do at that moment", "that\u2019s exactly what i learned, how to raise consciously the stress hormone level, purely controlled, and i\u2019m able to deal with the situation at that moment without panicking", "and i think that\u2019s one of the crucial findings which could benefit for human mankind as it is very subjected to stress all the time, panicking, having fear, and all that", "and i learned in nature how to deal with that", "and the cold brought me that science, brought me that knowledge, wisdom actually", "and the raising of stress hormones, so controlling something that has long been thought to be part of the autonomous nervous system, something that you have no control over, right", "and we\u2019ll get to the breathing because breathing is very interesting since it\u2019s both autonomous, but you can consciously control it and practice different methods", "i think it was certainly in the vice documentary that recently came out, which i recommend to everyone, and i\u2019ll link to it in the show notes, but was it in 2011 that you were injected with some type of virus or bacteria to \u2212 exactly", "\u2212 see if you could control the immune response", "that was at the dutch \u2013 i\u2019m going to mispronounce this \u2013 the radboud university", "exactly, radboud university in holland, and the intensive care nuclear science", "i underwent an experiment, and they injected me with an endotoxin, with a toxin actually, which is a part of bacteria", "and that creates a very dramatic immune response", "and as we have no control over the immune response in our body, they thought i was not able to do it as well as expected because nobody showed to be able to suppress the immune response because it is part of the autonomic nervous system", "and nobody\u2019s able to do that until now", "i showed that i was very able, within a quarter of an hour, instead of hours suffering from uncontrolled shivering, fever, headaches, and all that, i showed within a quarter of an hour, to have control, complete, over the symptoms and also the cytokines, which are the flammatory beings in the blood created by the immune response", "and i showed in the blood and by blood results to suppress them dramatically within a quarter", "and then they told me, \u201cokay", "but you are an exception that confirms the rule because you have been training so many years", "you are the iceman", "you do exceptional features", "but nobody is able to do that without that proper training of so many years.\u201d and i told them, \u201cno, i can train them within ten days.\u201d and then the professor was really challenged because if this group would show to be able within ten days to be able to influence deeply into the autonomic nervous system related to the immune system, then that\u2019s for the first time in the scientific history", "but he saw the indication of the possibility, but still thought, \u201cthose guys are not going to be able to do that within ten days.\u201d and you know what", "it wasn\u2019t within ten days", "it was within four days of training that i made them able to undergo the same experiment", "that means the injection of the endotoxin and have them within a quarter of an hour completely control over their immune system, related to the autonomic nervous system", "so, they showed 100 percent score of everybody to be able, within a couple of days, to tap into the autonomic nervous system related to the immune system", "and, yeah, and the training, about the training prior to it, we had our beers, you know, in the evening, and a lot of music and very relaxed", "and their mindset, i said, \u201chey, guys, probably you guys are the new gladiators", "we are going to win the worst war ever, which produced the most casualties, agony, pain, and all that, and that\u2019s the bacteria, that\u2019s the bacilli, that\u2019s the virus, and we\u2019re going to win this war", "are you with me?\u201d that\u2019s the way i talked to them", "and so, they had a mindset", "so, in the evening, we relaxed, and it was like a hippie movement", "but this is a new revolution", "in four days\u2019 time, they were able at the fourth day, without prior experience in the cold, they were able to go in shorts by minus-10", "that\u2019s about \u2013 i don\u2019t know in fahrenheit \u2013 celsius; this is celsius", "i mean, it\u2019s freezing cold", "yeah, that\u2019s probably in the 20s, probably \u2212 yes, in the 20s", "\u2212 below freezing, yeah", "and then, for hours and hours, we were going uphill and up the mountain, and we arrived at the summit after hours, and it was minus-27, minus-27 celsius", "that is more than 20s", "it\u2019s probably 10, something like that", "and we danced the harlem shake up there", "then i knew these guys are ready", "in four days\u2019 time, when they will be internalized in the hospital and injected with the endotoxin, they will be able because i feel when somebody is back into its natural state of his or her physiology, and i know how to do that", "the cold trained me", "the cold is my teacher", "and with these subjects, i\u2019m so curious to ask because, i mean, i am certainly not as proficient as you are in any of these techniques, but i\u2019ve enjoyed experimenting over the last ten years and writing about these short experiments, whether it\u2019s related to breath-holding with david blaine or other aspects", "obviously, you\u2019re a professional, and i am not", "but i\u2019d be very curious to hear you perhaps elaborate, for instance, on the first day of training with these subjects in preparation to be injected four days later", "sure", "what did the first day of training look like for them", "just in the morning at ease at 8:00 without food intake, we do breathing, and they lie on the ground all because that\u2019s the most relaxed pose", "and if you are relaxed, you are able to store up, hold a lot more oxygen than when in tension or in posture", "so, i say to them, \u201cjust lay down and relax", "now, we are going to begin", "just breathe in deeply and let go, breathe in deeply, let go", "make it a rhythm", "breathe in deeply, let go, not fully out, but fully in, and let go.\u201d and repeat that about 30, 40 times until these indications or symptoms come about, and that means lightheadedness, loose in the body, feeling loose in the body, tingling, contractions", "that\u2019s because carbon dioxide goes out, oxygen is roaming freely throughout the body, and the ph levels rise", "they are optimized, so they get to their best condition", "and that\u2019s proven", "that\u2019s proven", "and they saw, when we do this, they saw all these results chemically", "then, once you feel positively charged with all these symptoms of lightheadedness, feeling loose, contractions, and tingling in the body, i asked them, \u201cjust breathe in deeply, let go", "and now, the last time, breathe in deeply, and let go", "\u201cand after letting go, after exhalation, stop", "refrain from breathing", "there is no need", "we\u2019ve got a whole lot of oxygen.\u201d and measurement devices are not able to detect how much", "it\u2019s more than 100 percent", "that\u2019s my opinion", "but devices still are not able to detect that", "they only can go up to 100 percent, as they say", "but the 100 percent, the body is able to store up more oxygen than measurement devices of now are able to measure", "so, then, after one half-minute, then you see that the measurement device shows 100 percent, and then it goes dramatically down afterwards", "and you\u2019re using a pulse oximeter, something that you clip on your finger", "yes, yes, pulse oximeter", "so, you need a heartbeat", "you have a heartbeat, and you have the saturation of the oxygen inside the blood, so the amount of oxygen", "so, after one half-minute, you see with everybody that their saturation of the blood is going down", "and you know people with copd \u2013 that\u2019s lung diseases and all that \u2013 they suffer from real severe copd when they have 85", "we go to 90, to 80, 70, 60, 50", "people die at 50 and 40, 40 percent saturation in the blood", "we go past", "we go even to 30", "and then the device, measurement device, the oximeter shuts down", "it is not measuring anymore", "but we even go past that one", "now, why don\u2019t the subjects pass out at this point", "they don\u2019t pass out because they are alkaline", "i see", "their ph degrees are really perfect at that moment", "and instead of a person who is dying, he is very acidic", "so, that\u2019s the difference", "so, because we are so alkaline, people maybe sometimes are able to pass out, but just two seconds or three seconds because they are out of their conditioned control", "but after exercising, they regain not only control in those moments and those situations, they win a new part in the brain", "they get very deep in the brain", "and it\u2019s all new terrain", "it\u2019s like a baby", "a baby has no problem with their relax", "but there are no metorical neurons to relax yet established", "so, we are going to different parts of the brain where the guy or the girl never has been", "so, it\u2019s logic that people are able to pass out, but nothing happens because they are alkaline", "so, they just wake up and mostly or almost always, they wake up very happy", "it\u2019s like a drug experience", "but that\u2019s besides of the real effect i\u2019m trying to \u2013 not trying \u2013 which we showed scientifically is to be able to tap into the immune system in all the layers", "those are three layers", "and normally, we are not able to get into the second and the third layer", "and i say now, we have found a key to the second and the third layer", "that means the non-specific immune system and the specific adaptive immune system", "and that makes us looking to disease completely different because our ability is so much more", "dr", "dominic d\u2019agostino: dom is one of my most popular guests i\u2019ve had on the podcast", "you guys ask for more and more and more", "you just love him", "he\u2019s appeared on the podcast a total of three times, although i recommend people start with the first", "dom is an assistant professor in the department of molecular pharmacology and physiology at the university of south florida morsani college of medicine", "that\u2019s a mouthful", "much of his work is related to nutritional strategies for peak performers and resilience in extreme environments", "for instance, he does a lot of work for the special operations communities in developing esters and exogenous ketones that can do things like prevent or mitigate brain damage in hypoxic environments, meaning lack of oxygen, or even extend breath-hold times and oxygen utilization and so on", "he\u2019s a very impressive guy", "he is a highly legitimate athlete in his own right and built like the incredible hulk", "in this last segment that we\u2019re going to sample, we get a little into the weeds scientifically, but i know that you can get some great tips from it, so bear with it, and a real understanding of the power of ketosis or at least the ketogenic diet", "most important, his information might save your life", "there are certain circumstances within which the ketogenic diet or ketosis can be used as a medical adjunct to, say, improve, in the case of fasting, the resilience of normal cells prior to treatments for cancer, including chemotherapy and so on", "it is not intended to be a standalone treatment for cancer, so do not spread that nonsense but, as an adjunct, many people i know who have been diagnosed with cancer have used it, so that instead of being laid out the next day after, say, radiation or chemo, there are able to run five, ten miles in the morning", "and his approach to ketosis has certainly changed my life and helped me to recover from very severe symptoms of lyme disease", "there is a lot of diet talk, but the supplements and fasting can be treated as separate tools, so you don\u2019t necessarily need to consume a lot of bacon and heavy cream to get into a ketonic state", "now, for those of you not familiar with his work, here\u2019s a very quick primer: the ketogenic diet is often nicknamed keto", "this is a high-fat diet that mimics fasting physiology; in other words, what you do when you starve; you get lost in the woods", "you start to break down body fat for fuel", "your brain and body begin to use ketones, which are derived from stored or ingested fat for energy instead of blood sugar, glucose, and that is the state of ketosis", "the diet was originally developed for treating epileptic children, believe it or not, but there are many variations, including the atkins diet, which became very, very popular", "you can achieve ketosis through fasting, diet, exogenous ketones \u2013 that means supplemental ketones, which can come in powder or liquid form \u2013 or some combination of all of those", "one of the most common questions i get is, how do you know when you\u2019re in ketosis", "i don\u2019t think the urinalysis strips, the keto strips are very reliable because, as you become fat-adapted, you excrete fewer of these ketone bodies", "and the most reliable way at this point in time is using a device called the precision xtra, x-t-r-a, by abbott, a-b-b-o-t-t", "you can buy it on amazon and other places", "this can both measure glucose and blood levels of ketone bodies, specifically beta-hydroxybutyrate", "so, you prick your finger, and you feed it into this device", "and once you get a readout of 0.5 millimolars, m-m-o-l \u2013 that is the concentration of your blood \u2013 you can consider yourself lightly in ketosis", "i tend to feel the most increased mental clarity and so on at 1\u00a0millimolar or higher", "now, here we go with more of dom\u2019s wisdom", "please enjoy", "let\u2019s define ketosis", "what is ketosis", "i guess we could talk about nutritional and sort of fasting ketosis", "but what is ketosis exactly, and what are ketones", "dom d\u2019agostino: okay", "i\u2019d kind of like to start out with fasting", "sure, perfect", "dom d\u2019agostino: so, if we\u2019re on a normal diet, and we stop eating all of a sudden, we will mobilize and use up our stored glycogen, mostly in the liver", "and our central nervous system more or less demands that we have a steady fuel supply to our brain", "and in the absence of glucose availability, we\u2019ll be depleting our liver glycogen, the insulin levels will be suppressed, and we\u2019ll start mobilizing fatty acids for fuel", "but fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids don\u2019t cross the blood-brain barrier very efficiently", "the liver, while you\u2019re suppressing the hormone insulin, you\u2019ll upregulate beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver", "and an accumulation of products from fatty acid oxidation will start forming ketone bodies", "and these ketone bodies are \u2013 they\u2019re more or less like water-soluble fat molecules", "they\u2019re small molecules that can readily cross the blood-brain barrier and get inside cells, into the mitochondria", "and as we fast, within about 24 to 48 hours, we\u2019ll start registering ketones to the level that clinically is defined as being in ketosis \u2013 i was going to ask you about that", "dom d\u2019agostino: \u2212 which is above the 0.5 millimolar \u2212 oh, 0.5", "dom d\u2019agostino: \u2212 typically, yeah", "so, a person on a high-carb diet would probably take about 24 to 48 hours to start even getting into mild ketosis", "but fasting is the fastest way to get into ketosis and that\u2019s why if you have a child with drug-resistance seizures, and they\u2019re admitted into a place like johns hopkins, the old protocol was to fast them", "they\u2019re not exactly sure if that\u2019s absolutely necessary with things like more \u2013 ketogenic diets have mcts and stuff \u2013 but fasting has classically been the fastest way to get into ketosis", "so, the ketogenic diet has a macronutrient ratio that\u2019s high in fat, typically 90 to 70", "and by macronutrients, we\u2019re referring to protein, fat, carbohydrates", "dom d\u2019agostino: yeah, yeah", "and maybe ketones could be the fourth macronutrient, maybe, if you talk about exogenous ketones", "right, right", "dom d\u2019agostino: so, a ketogenic diet has a macronutrient ratio that mimics the metabolic physiology that you have when you\u2019re fasting", "so, if you were to take the blood out of someone and do a blood sample of someone on a strict ketogenic diet, it would look like they\u2019re fasting, like they\u2019ve been fasting a few days", "that changes your physiology incredibly", "your metabolic physiology changes acutely, and then there\u2019s long-term changes that occur with that, epigenetic changes", "we know that beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is a ketone body, can have interesting effects on gene expression", "what types of effects", "dom d\u2019agostino: well, there was a science paper showing that beta-hydroxybutyrate is an hdac class i and class ii inhibitor and can activate genes that play a role in enhancing endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, specifically superoxide dismutase and catalase", "so, these mechanisms, when they\u2019re upregulated, it confers protection against the environment", "it sort of enhances our cellular defense mechanisms", "it enhances the robust kind of protective mechanisms that the cell has that can preserve the genome stability", "so, maybe being in a state of ketosis and maintaining that can protect your dna from damage", "so, that\u2019s the implications", "also, anti-inflammatory: so, we published a paper", "our colleagues actually did it at yale", "i developed the diet for them and sent it up to them", "it was exogenous ketones", "but the paper demonstrated that it activated or prevented the activation of a particular inflammasome that\u2019s linked to age-related chronic diseases", "so, it inhibited a specific inhibitory pathway that is really associated with all chronic age-related diseases", "and it was independent of the ketones\u2019 effect on metabolism", "they did a lot of studies to tease out the mechanism and demonstrated that the effect of it suppressing an inflammatory pathway was completely independent of its metabolic effect", "so, we understand that \u2013 when i got into this, i just knew that ketones were an energy metabolite", "so, now, we know it\u2019s much more than a metabolite", "it\u2019s an hdac inhibitor", "and the pharmaceutical \u2212 how do you spell that", "i apologize", "hdac", "dom d\u2019agostino: oh, yeah, histone deacetylase inhibitor, so hdac would be h-d-a-c", "got it", "dom d\u2019agostino: and then there\u2019s class i, ii, iii, i think iv", "so, class i and ii hdac inhibitors are a big, big \u2013 are of big interest to the pharmaceutical industry", "so, there are many \u2013 for example, we do a lot of cancer research", "there\u2019s a lot of pharmaceutical companies focusing on histone deacetylase inhibitors as targeting specific pathways for cancer therapy", "so, you have an endogenous hdac inhibitor with beta-hydroxybutyrate", "and not to interrupt, but just for people who want to keep endogenous and exogenous straight, i\u2019ve always found thinking of exoskeleton as sort of outside, as an indicator of outside", "so, if you\u2019re taking \u2013 please correct me if i screw this up in any way, dom \u2013 but if you\u2019re taking exogenous ketones, that means you are consuming ketones from outside of your body", "and endogenous is something you\u2019re producing yourself", "dom d\u2019agostino: yes", "what was the study that you did on advance lifters as it related to ketosis, and what\u2019s kind of the abstract on that", "dom d\u2019agostino: yeah, that\u2019s under review right now", "got it", "dom d\u2019agostino: and, yeah, i\u2019ll give you kind of the synopsis of it", "so, we had 12\u00a0subjects, and these were advanced resistance-trained individuals, meaning that they could squat and deadlift and bend to a certain percentage of their bodyweight, which kind of puts them in the range of the top 10 percent of lifters out there", "what was that percentage, just out of curiosity", "dom d\u2019agostino: i\u2019ve got to go back", "it was some funky number, not like \u2013 it was like 185 percent or 75 percent \u2013 got it", "dom d\u2019agostino: \u2212 of their bodyweight squatting for seven reps or eight reps or something like that", "got it", "dom d\u2019agostino: so, it was pretty \u2013 it would be like me \u2013 let me see \u2013 squatting 425 or something for a set of six or something like that", "okay, yeah, these are very \u2212 dom d\u2019agostino: it was pretty significant", "\u2212 yeah, significantly advanced trainees", "dom d\u2019agostino: yeah", "so, yeah, the gist of that is that we did a parallel", "the control group was on a western diet, which is pretty similar to kind of moderate protein, higher in carbohydrates, and moderate fat", "and the ketogenic diet had roughly 75 to 80 percent fat, restricted carbohydrates to about 20 to 25 grams per day, and the fat was also supplemented to some extent with mct oil and coconut oil", "and all the subjects, it was two weeks they had to be on the diet and had to confirm ketone levels by blood and urine", "and once they did, we only did a two-week adaptation, which is kind of another subject we could talk about, but they adapted for two weeks and then kind of trained the heck out of them", "and every workout was done in the lab, in a human performance laboratory", "and everything was recorded", "the volume was controlled", "all the parameters were controlled", "bloodwork was done", "and the take-home on it was that i would say strength and performance were maintained and increased, and muscle hypertrophy was seen with a ketogenic diet", "and there were similar increases, yeah, in power, in hypertrophy", "and the big difference was kind of the overall body composition was more favorable in the ketogenic diet group, meaning they had similar increases in lean body mass, but they lost proportionately more fat", "and that\u2019s the study that we completed", "it\u2019s under review right now", "the first journal kicked it back", "so, we went in for another journal and did some follow-up work with it", "now, what is your hypothesis \u2013 or maybe you already know \u2013 but how would you explain the maintenance or even development of hypertrophy and power in the ketogenic group when a lot of people associate, say, insulin with different growth factors and whatnot", "and i had a conversation \u2013 i want to say it was with stephen phinney \u2013 very short conversation, and i asked him this because i had been in a ketotic state for two or three weeks and had experienced a nontrivial amount of muscle growth, and i was really surprised by it", "and he explained in terms that i can\u2019t recall, but how the ketogenic diet might have, i guess, a branched-chain amino acid sparing effect of some type", "but is it possible to get very big and powerful on a ketogenic diet", "and, if so, what\u2019s the mechanism in the absence of higher spiking insulin levels, if that is the parent anabolic hormone", "and i\u2019m not saying it is, but a lot of people view it that way", "dom d\u2019agostino: yeah", "so, there\u2019s insulin and insulin signaling, right", "certain diet \u2013 when you calorie-restrict a rodent or even humans or any mammal, you will enhance insulin sensitivity, right", "so, you will be more sensitive to a given amount of insulin", "and i think we\u2019re seeing some of that in the athletes", "i mean, exercise itself enhances insulin sensitivity", "so, guys that are advanced lifters who\u2019ve been at it for ten years may have a different response to a ketogenic diet than, say, a 15-year-old kid who\u2019s trying to bulk up for football", "he would probably not be a good candidate for the ketogenic diet", "your sensitivity to things like igf-1 and insulin are much higher when you\u2019re younger, in your teenage years especially", "so, you could compromise a lot of your potential development and strength if you\u2019re younger and doing that", "but the older we get, the less carbohydrate-tolerant we get", "so, we lose our ability to kind of process carbs as we get older, and our insulin sensitivity declines", "going back to your question, as it relates to being on a ketogenic diet, we know that ketones are anticatabolic", "that\u2019s why we can fast for 40 days", "and the ketones have an anticatabolic protein sparing effect", "and if our blood is flooded with ketones, we\u2019re less likely to liberate gluconeogenic amino acids from our skeletal muscle for fuel because the ketones can more or less replace glucose as a primary energy substrate to maintain your central nervous system, which is three percent of our body by weight but sucks up 20 or 25\u00a0percent of the energy", "it\u2019s a big metabolic engine", "so, the ketones kind of drive a lot of that substrate energy need", "so, in a situation where you\u2019re at a caloric deficit, i think that\u2019s where ketones can shine, if you\u2019re trying to make weight, if you\u2019re trying to preserve or even increase your performance and strength and alter your body composition", "so, i don\u2019t think the ketogenic diet is ideal if your goal is maximum, a purely ketogenic diet", "i think there are different \u2013 we have to kind of figure out what ketogenic diet we\u2019re talking about", "but i don\u2019t think a purely ketogenic diet, as it\u2019s kind of described in the literature, right, a 90 or 85 percent fat diet, is an ideal diet for growth and repair", "the diet that we use in our study is actually a little higher in protein, like 25 percent protein, which is really almost double that used by the johns hopkins group that developed the classical ketogenic diet, and it\u2019s really that protein level is important", "so, growing on a classic ketogenic diet would be pretty hard", "i mean, kids do it", "their growth rates are a little bit less with these kids that have drug-resistant seizures when they\u2019re put on the diet", "but if you simply just do what\u2019s called a modified atkins, and there\u2019s a lot of literature coming out now on the modified atkins \u2013 eric kossoff at johns hopkins, he\u2019s a colleague of mine and more in the clinical realm, and he\u2019s done a lot of work showing that a modified atkins, which is about 70 percent fat and 20 or 30\u00a0percent protein, has the same sort of ability to metabolically manage seizures", "and i think that sort of diet can be used pretty successfully in the performance world and specifically for bodybuilders", "i think, with that amount of protein, you would be able to grow muscle for sure", "and it\u2019s calories, too, right", "i mean, calories are the driver, your caloric intake", "if you have a surplus amount of calories, you\u2019re more likely to push insulin up and drive anabolic processes", "but a lot of times, people, when they follow a ketogenic diet, because ketones have a really good appetite suppressant effect, they will inadvertently restrict calories and may not even know it after a while and may be losing weight without even trying", "and that\u2019s one of the benefits, i guess you could say, of the ketogenic diet", "you can lose weight, and you can alter your body composition without necessarily even trying, just through the appetite suppressing effect", "well, there you have it, folks", "that is the latest tim ferriss radio hour featuring some of the experts i\u2019ve spoken to in and across more than 200 episodes \u2013 what", "\u2013 of this podcast", "that\u2019s crazy", "the tim ferriss radio hour is an experiment, and it takes a good amount of work", "so, it\u2019s now over to you", "i want you to tell me, do you like it", "do you not like it", "what should we do more of", "what should we do less of", "please tell me how we can improve
