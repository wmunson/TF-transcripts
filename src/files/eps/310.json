"num_words": 14019, "raw_text": "Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Tim, welcome to the show. So, you sent me a photograph en route, or I guess just after arriving here, and you had a\u00a0gi on, open, and blood running down your face. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, where were you and what happened? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I was not but four miles away from here and we just had the IBJJF World Jiu-Jitso Competition this weekend. And so last week, we were doing very sports jiu-jitso training, getting people ready for the tournament. I hate sports jiu-jitso. I think sports jiu-jitso is the abomination to what martial arts is, where it takes something that\u2019s really cool and then they make it sporty. It\u2019s like, oh, let\u2019s give some points to do some stupid things. And then people \u2013 the mutation that evolves \u2013 how it evolves, it loses its balls. And I don\u2019t like things that had balls and then no longer have balls. It\u2019s kinda seems like the emasculated man and that\u2019s what jiu-jitso has almost become. Jiu-jitso to me is I\u2019m gonna get in mount or side control. I\u2019m gonna pick your face up. I\u2019m gonna smash it into the cement. And then I\u2019m gonna push your eyes and then I\u2019m gonna bite your cheek off. That\u2019s jiu-jitso to me because that\u2019s the origin of it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The gentle art. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, the gentle art. And so today, we did combat jiu-jitso. So, just to have a total paradigm shift, just to make people\u2019s heads explode; instead of talking about getting four points for back control, or getting four points for mount, or getting a takedown and getting two, it\u2019s like find a place that you can hold somebody down and then hit them. And that\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I was watching a video in prep for this. I think it was from Sheepdog Response and we can talk about it in a second, but you had back control on someone. You\u2019re right on top of them. They were all turtled up on the ground and you sort of wiped your fingers on their eyes. And you\u2019re like, okay, yeah, I just took your eyes out. So, something along the lines of old man jiu-jitso leads to old men dying or something like that. But there\u2019s just such a huge delta between the two. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0You have to look at the origin of what things are and then the abomination of what they become. What you see as these really \u2013 the genesis of a martial art was they had to learn how to protect themselves. Or they didn\u2019t have weapons, so they had to create something to fight the dictators that were killing them. Or there were the samurai that were really good with swords. So, then the ninjas came along; to use stealth because if you fight a ninja head-on, you\u2019re gonna die. So, let\u2019s create something new. Then over time, that loses what it is. You have to be \u2013 or competitively practice something to get good at it, so then you can implement sport. And that\u2019s what kinda differentiates a lot of this different jiu-jitso, or a lot of these different martial arts, are just really tiny little rules. What\u2019s the difference between judo and jiu-jitso, and jiu-jitso and Greco-Roman wrestling, and Greco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling, and collegiate wrestling? So, they\u2019re very small differences. That\u2019s to make them a sport. But if you take those rules away, you get back to what the martial art was, which was how to fight for your life and not get murdered. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, and I think it\u2019s also misleading when people think of the term martial art and they turned it into some type of performance in the art \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, they take body paint and I\u2019m gonna start putting my chest all over this window and I\u2019m doing martial arts. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And it\u2019s actually when you go back to the translation from say \u2013 whether it\u2019s wushu in Chinese or any of these bujitso in Japanese \u2013 I used to live in Japan \u2013 it\u2019s actually martial technique that then got translated to art. So, it\u2019s lost some of its impact through a mistranslation, in a sense. And when I look at your career, I saw you fight live in some early Strikeforce events when I was living in San Jose, and then became fascinated by your military career, which we\u2019ll talk about. Seems like you\u2019re very good at game-time decisions and acting under pressure. So, I want to talk about training though for a second. Can you talk about what you say to yourself when you train and at least my understanding is it begins with hurry up, dot, dot, dot? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, hurry up and fail. Funny enough, as I send you that picture of me dripping blood out of my face and I have blood already clotted in my mouth, it gets stuck as it starts congealing. It turns into that gelatin up inside of kinda weird cavities inside of your nose. So, if you cough, chunks start flying. As I was trying to explain what it means to train \u2013 so somebody came up to me at the end of practice today. And they\u2019re like, man, I keep getting tired, or I keep quitting, or I had a couple people that just tapped from the position that I was in \u2013 or that they were in. And so hurry up and fail is this mantra of I wanna get to the breaking point of where I can\u2019t go on any longer, and I wanna stay there. Because then the next time I train, that wall has moved. I mean, ever so slightly, but it\u2019s moved. So, then the next time, I can go in and I can get to that point as hard and as fast as I can, and then I can stay there. So, then the next time, it\u2019s gonna move. And repeat until finally, if you look back months later, you\u2019ve progressed so far. Today I was at Onnit Academy and we did the exact same workout we did two months ago; same weight. And what two months ago left us on the ground almost heaving in nauseous \u2013 couldn\u2019t stand up, about to throw up; today, we blew through effortlessly. And Juan, Shane, and I looked at each other and were like, what are we supposed to do right now? Because we have an extra 16 minutes because we went through it so fast. So, in two months, there was such a clear change of looking back and seeing like, man, I got bigger, I got faster, I got stronger, and I ultimately got harder to kill. So, in jiu-jitso, it\u2019s the exact same. You rush to that breaking point. And by no means do I wanna say somebody\u2019s gonna break me. Because if somebody can break me, I welcome it, bring it. I call over the world to try and find people that can do that, so I can find that point where I\u2019m gonna fail. And then the next time I do it, it\u2019s gonna move. You know? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, when you then fast-forward to an example of an environment in which the stakes are a little higher \u2013 so I\u2019d love to talk about Roger Gracie; starting with an R for you non-Brazilians out there. I was chatting with a mutual acquaintance \u2013 actually before we get to mutual acquaintance, I owe credit to the person who made the introduction, who is Donald Park \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0 Love that guy. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 who I went to college with, who used to be a super lightweight blue belt that I could throw around because of judo. Now I can no longer throw him around because he\u2019s a black belt. And co-owner of a school, which is where you were training today. What\u2019s the name of the school? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Gracie Humaita. I think it\u2019s \u2013 Royler Gracie is \u2013 it\u2019s in his lineage, Royler Gracie black belt, but Donald Park and Paulo Brandao are the ones that run this school. And it is a shark tank of passionate people that love family and martial arts. And that\u2019s what that place is. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And for those of you who don\u2019t want staph infections, also a very clean school. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Oh, that\u2019s one of my favorite things. I\u2019m a huge germophobe \u2013 not a germophobe, but I\u2019m a crazy clean person. And I walked in today and I could smell bleach. God, I love that smell, you know? I actually have a huge infection on my leg right now because I was in Florida and I got my leg sliced open on the side of a boat after I smashed a window with a tomahawk. And my leg got infected from it because the water \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if you know this \u2013 in Miami is not really clean. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, right. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. So, I\u2019m cutting my leg open so I can scrub it with iodine so this infection goes away because I also don\u2019t like prescriptions. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright. Well, I can\u2019t leave that and go back to Roger Gracie immediately, so we\u2019ll get to Roger in due time. So, you\u2019re in a boat, you smash a window with a tomahawk. What the hell happened? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0The boat was on fire and it was sinking. I didn\u2019t wanna drown, so I smashed a window. And then I tried to swim out. And then the glass in the window cut my leg. And then I got what I think is poop water inside of my cut leg. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s the context for that? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Well, somebody had pooped in the water, so sorry \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No, why were you \u2013 why was there broken glass, tomahawk, boat on fire to begin with? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0We\u2019re recreating a commercial fisherman\u2019s worst nightmare, which is being on a boat that\u2019s on fire that\u2019s sinking. And you\u2019re gonna have to make a bunch of decisions at once. Am I gonna try to put the fire out? Am I gonna try to save the boat? Am I gonna start to get my rescue equipment? Am I gonna start trying to find my beacon? Am I gonna start deploying the lifeboat? Am I gonna get my immersion suit? So, you have a whole bunch of really bad options to choose from and all of those bad options might dictate whether you live or die. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0This is for the TV show that you\u2019re \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 finishing up? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yep. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s the name of the show? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It\u2019s called Hard to Kill. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Aptly named. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, but not me. It\u2019s not about me being hard to kill, which I hope I am. The Hard to Kill, it\u2019s to pay homage to guys and gals that do these jobs that are in-freaking-sane. Imagine we\u2019re sitting here talking right now. Some random dude just started rappelling down the side of this window to clean our window. People do that job. That\u2019s kinda crazy. And they do it when the wind\u2019s blowing 30-40 miles an hour. That little crane right there, which doesn\u2019t have an American flag on it \u2013 that vex \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You don\u2019t seem pleased about it. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0No, that vexes me. I wanna go tear that thing down Hulk style and start throwing those construction guys off until they put up an American flag. Oh, they got their little brands up there, whatever those are, don\u2019t care. If you\u2019re listening right now and you\u2019re a crane operator, I implore you to please put an American flag on your crane. We want to see it. Alright, so \u2013 oh, I\u2019m getting a cramp in my hamstring. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0This is the most action-packed podcast I\u2019ve ever done already. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I need to drink some more water. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How did Tim Kennedy pull his hamstring? He was doing a podcast with Tim Ferriss. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0They\u2019re really intense. You have intense podcasts. So, we find these jobs that are super dangerous. And people do them every single day and they embody the spirit of the American people. They do something that provides, that puts food on tables, that puts gas in cars, that delivers medications to people in nowhere Alaska, and these are brave, courageous, fearless people that do the jobs every single day. And then we find, in that job, their worst nightmare, their worst case scenario, their worst day, and then I go and I do that. So, I learn about the job. I learn about the people. I learn about why they do it. And then ultimately, how they survive or sometimes even perish, and I go and do that thing, which is dumb. Which leads me \u2013 I\u2019m 20 pounds lighter than I normally am, and I have a bunch of jacked-up cuts all over my body right now, and I\u2019m trying to march on. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You seem good at marching on. I mean, the common thread that occurs to me at least \u2013 one thing that fascinates me about people in those situations, anyone in very high-pressure situations, is the internal monologue, sort of the self-talk. Which I\u2019m gonna use as a segue to Roger Gracie. So Roger, for people who don\u2019t know who he is \u2013 chatting with a second mutual acquaintance who I\u2019m not sure if he wants to be named or not, we can talk about who he is afterwards, but he said you could consider Roger one of the \u2013 many people would consider him one of the top five jiu-jitso competitors of all time. Would you say that\u2019s a fair statement? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I would put him top three. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Top three, alright. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I\u2019d tie him with three other guys. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright, just out of curiosity, who else would be up at the top in your mind? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Fortunately, Gordon Ryan right now is definitely up there. Lovato and without a doubt, I\u2019d have to include New York \u2013 I can\u2019t even remember his name right now. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m sure somebody from the internet will recognize who \u2013 oh, wait a second. I know who you\u2019re talking about. You\u2019re talking about Marcelo Garcia. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, Marcelo Garcia, yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, that was the Marcelo-tine. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, the Marcelo guillotine. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Lucien, high elbow. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Marcelo\u2019s amazing. But Roger\u2019s in there. And you fought Roger in MMA rules \u2013 or under MMA rules. When you\u2019re walking out to enter the octagon to fight someone like that \u2013 and just to flash forward, I mean, the story as it was retold to me, having seen the footage, but it was retold to me by another high-level jiu-jitso practitioner. He said not only on the feet did you effectively beat the shit out of Roger, but on the ground also you were able to do that. So, two questions; when you\u2019re walking out, are you saying hurry up and fail to yourself on the way out to the octagon? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0No, on game day, when I\u2019m putting rounds in my magazines \u2013 so when you put your body armor on, put your helmet on, you do a commo check \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Do a what check? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0A commo check, a communication with the radio \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, communications check. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 on all the different channels and we have your primary, secondary contingent, and emergency channels. Then the very next thing you do is you chamber a round into your pistol because if you do your rifle first, you\u2019ll forget to do your pistol. So, you do these things and these pre-mission checks in a very specific order so you never miss something. So, I\u2019m in gun fight with my rifle, my rifle runs out of ammunition, somebody\u2019s charging at me, I go to transition, I forgot to put a round in the chamber. You think you\u2019d never do that, but you\u2019re about to have \u2013 the helicopter\u2019s getting spun up. Guys are putting their gear on. You can forget, so you do things very meticulously. When I put that round in my chamber of my pistol before I start putting a round in the chamber of my rifle, which is the last thing that I do before I start taking tape off of charges or making sure all my grenades are prepped properly, it\u2019s like not today. That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling myself. I can fail all the time in training. I can rush to failure. I can hurry up and fail at every opportunity when I\u2019m getting ready, but when finally bullets are gonna fly, or I\u2019m gonna walk into that octagon, or I\u2019m gonna kick that door in, not today; not a fucking chance are you gonna beat me on that day. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Is that what you repeat to yourself when you step into the octagon and you\u2019re waiting for all the announcing to complete or is there more that goes through your head? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I\u2019m actually waiting for the first time I make a mistake and somebody thinks that they\u2019re gonna do something great. That I\u2019m gonna get hit the first time. Or in Roger\u2019s case, I shot an inside single on him to put him on his back, which nobody thought in my right mind I would do and he got my back. Roger Gracie\u2019s best position; Roger Gracie, if he gets on your back, you\u2019re going to sleep, period. I got there and I was like, hell yeah. Do you know what\u2019s gonna happen? I\u2019m gonna get out of here. I\u2019m gonna start punching you in the face. And think about what that\u2019s gonna do to him. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Psychologically. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Psychologically, I\u2019m in the best \u2013 he\u2019s in the best position that he can possibly be in, the thing that he\u2019s the best at, and this little hairy-handed monkey that\u2019s in front of him gets out and starts punching him in the face while he has his back. You know, he just \u2013 that was the end of the fight. I was three minutes into the fight and there was nothing he could do psychologically from that point forward because I already beat the thing he did the best. So, even in my failure, I was like, hell yeah, here I come. I wish I had blood dripping out of my mouth and sending him pictures later of it because that\u2019s the opportunity to really thrive; to grow and to just scare the freaking shit out of somebody. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I don\u2019t consider myself a fighter at all. Well, I mean, I\u2019m not an accomplished fighter in any capacity, but I enjoy interacting with people who are very good at combat sports. And you mentioned Marcelo earlier. So, I\u2019ve had a chance to spend time with Marcelo simply because his school in New York City is co-owned with a dear friend of mine name Josh Waitzkin, who, for those who don\u2019t know the name, was the basis for Searching for Bobby Fischer, both the book and the movie, formerly considered a chess prodigy. And what they did, and continue to do, at that school is they videotape training sessions, sparring sessions with Marcelo \u2013 and this is also including during his competitive career. And people were like, that\u2019s ridiculous. How would you possibly show your whole hand in a video? That\u2019s crazy. And all these other people are really secretive. And Marcelo\u2019s thinking was that doesn\u2019t bother me at all because that\u2019s my game. It\u2019s like if people try to enter my game, I\u2019m never gonna lose. I will always win. Yeah, you wanna watch my stuff and try play that hand? Yeah, sure, I would love for you to do that. And he\u2019s the sweetest guy ever, so I\u2019m using a tone that he would never use. Who are fighters past or present who really impress you? Are there any \u2013 they could be well-known, but I\u2019m particularly interested in names that folks might not recognize as the two or three guys in the marquis lights that have really been seen before. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Jeremy Horn; he was an old-school guy, but one of Chuck Liddell\u2019s first losses, if not his only loss by submission, was to Jeremy Horn. Yeah, Chuck\u2019s a NCAA wrestler; the Iceman, putting everybody to sleep. Just cool, calm, collected, walks out and you can\u2019t take him down. He\u2019s just gonna hit you with these bricks for hands. And he gets on top of Jeremy and Jeremy just holds onto him; puts him in a head and arm choke in the guard and puts him to sleep. And waking Chuck up because he\u2019s so unconscious, and that was \u2013 he has a really unassuming body shape. They called him Gumby because he\u2019s just \u2013 he doesn\u2019t look like me. You look at me and you\u2019re like, whoa, I don\u2019t wanna fight that ape. You look at him and you\u2019re like, well, you can babysit my kids. Can you walk my dog? So, he\u2019s one of those guys that were just so disarming. Carlos Condit is another one where, especially at his prime, he looked like the idiot kid next door that you\u2019d want to mow your lawn and housesit. And clean dog poop out of the back of your house. You\u2019re like, he\u2019s just such a nice looking, pleasant, New Mexico kid. But when that bell rang, it was just pure violence everywhere. He would be elbowing you, spinning kicks, submissions, scrapple; it didn\u2019t matter where the fight went, he\u2019s just gonna fight. And there\u2019s no \u2013 the only way you can beat him is just being inches or seconds ahead of him in something for the whole, entire duration of the fight. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Hard to do. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, really hard to do. Because you\u2019re not gonna knock him out, you\u2019re not gonna submit him, you just have to out-endure him. And when I say endure, I\u2019m not talking Lance Armstrong on a bicycle. I\u2019m talking getting punched in the face for 25 minutes. That\u2019s a really dumb way to out-endure somebody. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, so this \u2013 You know, I put Jacare in that short list too of best grapplers. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I don\u2019t speak Portuguese. I think that\u2019s the crocodile, isn\u2019t it? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Jacare; the guy\u2019s an animal. I remember hearing stories. I didn\u2019t see this personally, but of him in jiu-jitso tournaments, literally just ripping the arms off \u2013 the fabric arms off of gis because of his strength and grip strength. What a beast. So, that leads me to a quote. And if this is a misquote, please correct it of course, but here we go. Quote, \u201cMy entire life revolves around the concept that I want to be the hardest person someone ever tries to kill. If you\u2019re going to come and think, oh, I\u2019m gonna kill Tim Kennedy, you might be able to, but it\u2019s going to be the nastiest, most evil, disgusting, violent affair that you could ever imagine occurring.\u201d How do you develop \u2013 I\u2019ll keep this really broad, but mental toughness and where does that fit in? Or what mental/psychological advantages do you have in life or in battle and how have you developed them? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0There are so many metaphors, and phrases, and little clich\u00e9s of \u2013 it\u2019s not the size of the dog, but the size of the fight in the dog. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right, yeah. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Right? It\u2019s not the size of the dog in the fight \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The dog in the fight \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s the fight of the dog in the fight. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The fight in the dog. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. That is developed. So, bulls; in the \u201860s and \u201870s, they had bucking bulls. And they are hard to ride. So, then what they started doing in the \u201870s and \u201880s, they started finding Mexican fighting bulls. These are mean, nasty bulls and they\u2019re breeding them with the bucking bulls. So, the bucking bulls are big, powerful bulls. And then what would happen in the \u201880s and \u201890s, guys used to be able to ride 60, 70, maybe even 80 percent of the time; they\u2019d successfully get their eight seconds. By the \u201880s, it was down to 50 percent. Right now, it\u2019s down to the 20s and 30s. The bulls are just bigger, they\u2019re meaner, and they buck just as hard. And the cowboys are not only scared of how hard they\u2019re gonna buck, but when they get thrown, that bull is turning around to try and murder that cowboy because now they\u2019re mean. So, it can be trained. It can be \u2013 in a bull\u2019s case, it\u2019s actually bred. But in Special Forces, there are a lot of different special operations units; Navy Seals and Marine Recon, I\u2019ll even give a nod to the Air Force with their JTACs, the Army Rangers. Army Special Forces, the Green Berets. In the process, once you get past selection, the next six months to ten months, they pretty much just tear away every level of who you are, of your ego. If we\u2019re gonna go Freudian, they\u2019re just stripping away everything down to the most raw element of you as a human. And that you\u2019re worthless, that you can\u2019t do anything. And you\u2019re so exposed and you\u2019re so vulnerable at this point that then they can start building a fresh foundation. And they start putting the cornerstones of never quitting, of always working hard, of planning relentlessly, and strategically looking for every opportunity to never have a fair fight. Because we feel so vulnerable and we feel so exposed, anything could hurt me right now. Fuck, if you fart on me, I might die. So, I have to have every single advantage strategically. I need to cheat in every way so I never have a fair fight. If I\u2019m gonna go and kick a door in and there\u2019s four bad guys in there, cool. I\u2019m gonna have 250 dudes with me. We\u2019re all gonna have better guns. We\u2019re all gonna have better ammo. We\u2019re gonna have better sites. We\u2019re gonna have aerial support. While that may not always be an option, that\u2019s what we want because we never wanna fail again because we felt so raw and exposed. And that\u2019s different from all other special operations and I think that\u2019s why Special Forces specifically has been so successful and so unheard of; so unremarkable that nobody knows the quiet professionals, which is our motto. It means that we\u2019re still successful. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What was the motto? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0The quiet professionals. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The quiet professionals. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, let\u2019s talk about how the military entered your life. And I don\u2019t know the exact timing on this, but it seems like you\u2019re \u2013 let\u2019s start with \u2013 and then you can sort of place us \u2013 9/11. So, it seems like your life changed quite dramatically around that time. Could you tell us who Tim Kennedy is at that point in time \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Do we have to? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0 \u2013 and what then happened, starting at 9/11? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Alright. Well, I\u2019m just gonna tell you a story. Mom, if you\u2019re listening, please stop. I\u2019m at The Pit where Chuck trained out of in \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0San Luis Obispo. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 San Luis Obispo. And I\u2019m training; sweaty, stinky. And this pretty good looking girl walks in and I was like, hey, girl. What\u2019s going on? And she\u2019s like, hey, I\u2019m looking for a guy that fought. He was the fourth or fifth fight that fought a few weekends ago at the WEC \u2013 the World Extreme Cagefighting fight on \u2013 I think it was on Halloween. I was like, oh, I fought that night. And she was like, oh yeah, I remember you. You look familiar. And I totally didn\u2019t remember her. And she tells me that she tested positive for HIV and that we\u2019d had a huge orgy that night. And she\u2019s trying to contact all of her partners that she\u2019s been with in the past few months to have them go get tested, that they might have AIDS. That pretty much personifies who I am. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0At the time? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0At the time, yeah. I graduated from high school a few years early, was done with college a couple of years early. At 18, I\u2019m an EMT, firefighter. At 19, I already have my undergrad. I start grad school and 9/11 happens. I got two girls pregnant; girls walking into the \u2013 I\u2019m just a talented, wasted piece of shit. I\u2019m wasted potential in every single sense of the word. And at the time that all of these things are going wrong and I\u2019m having this realization of I have to do something, I don\u2019t know what that is, a bunch of planes start slamming the buildings, into the Pentagon, into the two towers, into some random field in Virginia. And I\u2019m just sitting here watching live these things happen and realizing what a waste of a human I am. Everything was about what jeans am I gonna wear or if I\u2019m gonna bring a good bottle to someplace to impress somebody to be able to hook up with somebody else. It was just this horrible, humiliating slap in the face of you\u2019re a piece of shit. What are you gonna do now? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And then what happens? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0So, I walk into the recruiter\u2019s office and I say put me on the fastest course I possibly can to the worst place I can go. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright, so you do that. What do the people around you think of that decision? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0My mom was scared. My dad was proud. My brother was excited. All of my friends were just like me; so interested in themselves that it didn\u2019t matter what I was gonna be doing. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right, they were too self-absorbed to really have that much interest. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. My dad, he wasn\u2019t proud yet. He was exhilarated in the sense that I had a chance. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, in a way, you\u2019d been given a second chance, a reboot opportunity. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, in this case, it was probably my 50th chance. White privilege is a thing and I had every opportunity to succeed in anything I did. I was top ten in the world when I was 22 years old as a fighter, 21 as a fighter. I could\u2019ve done anything and I was just wasting everything. So, then at this point, it was my dad finally being like, okay, we got another chance. Let\u2019s see how this goes. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, if you could walk us through what happens in the weeks and months after that? Because I\u2019m very \u2013 I mean, I have friends who are both active and at this point certainly more so on the civilian side from military, but I\u2019ve never experienced it myself. So, what happens from that point forward? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0So, to get to Special Forces, there are a lot of tests; from intelligence tests \u2013 your ASVAB, your GT test. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What are those? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It\u2019s your general technical knowledge. There are high IQ people who can do amazing things on questionnaires and then if you hand them a puzzle, they kinda look at it like \u2013 or if you hand them a transmission and you say break this transmission down and put it back together. That\u2019s just a different type of mind. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Sure. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Special Forces, they want smart guys that are physically capable, that have a very, very high acumen in general technical ability. So, there\u2019s some tests that \u2013 when you take the ASVAB, which is kinda the general military intelligence test, that has subcategories that \u2013 one of which is your GT score, your general technical knowledge. So, make sure your scores are good. You have the proficiency to learn a second language quickly or you already have a second language, which is required in all Special Forces. And then you go to basic training as an infantryman. If you finish basic training, you go to Airborne School. You finish basic training, infantry school, and Airborne School, then you go to Special Operations Preparation Course. And this is the attritor. This is the opportunity for the Special Forces to get rid of you. It\u2019s run by senior Special Forces NCOs and they \u2013 it\u2019s their first access to the fresh population of potential candidates that are gonna go to selection. If you don\u2019t pass SOPC, then you don\u2019t get to go to selection. If you don\u2019t go to selection, then you go to the needs of the Army. You can go back to being infantry, or you could go to EOD, or you could do anything else. You just can\u2019t be a Green Beret. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What does EOD stand for? Or what is it? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It\u2019s getting rid of bombs; Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Okay, I got it. I got it. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Guys would go to Psychological Operations, Civil Affairs, just kinda any other high speed, cool job, but you\u2019re just never gonna be Special Forces. I think we had \u2013 we got there in April and they froze guys going to selection in May, June, July, and August because it was too hot and a bunch of Green Berets keep dying in selection. Well, pre-Green Berets. So, they wouldn\u2019t let us go. So, they had us for four or five months, of all of these recruits coming in. And the 500 of us, they sent 91 of us to selection. Everybody else went away. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Washed out a lot of people. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. And of the 91 of us, 88 of us got selected and then went to \u2013 when you get selected, that just means you get to go to the Q Course, which is somewhere between a year to two years of training to show up on the team, and then realize that you know nothing, and that you\u2019re a piece of shit, and that you have everything to learn the day that you walk through the door. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0When you got into the Q Course, what were you best at and what were you worst at? Where did you excel and where were you deficient the most, if you remember? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0They loved the gray guy. They always said be the gray man. Be the man \u2013 be the guy \u2013 you know, there are 200 people in formation, be the guy that nobody knows the name of. Which means if you\u2019re gonna run a PT test, there\u2019s the guy that goes the fastest and there\u2019s the guy that goes the slowest. You wanna be the guy that just passes that nobody knows about. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why is that? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Being so unremarkable is, especially in Special Operations, a trait that\u2019s really hard to find. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Is that for blending in later, for being inconspicuous later? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, and also, we don\u2019t want show boaters. You can go to the Navy Seals. And we don\u2019t want failures. You can go to the Air Force. So, we want that sweet middle ground. We want the gray man that can do anything, that will always pass, and you forget about the moment you take your eyes off him. I\u2019m looking right at you, but where\u2019d you go, man? I know you were right there. You cross the finish line and you\u2019re like, alright, great job. What was that dude\u2019s name again? That\u2019s the guy that we want because that guy\u2019s priceless. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, were you that guy? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I was not that guy. I was the guy that would finish first. I was the guy that was \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Biceps the size of my chest probably. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, and competitive shooter, a professional fighter. They knew who I was. So, it took a lot of practice, and training, and pain to kinda get the gray man mentality. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I wanted to be \u2013 I wanted everybody to be like, oh, look at Tim. Great. Look at that guy. Be like Tim. That\u2019s just not how it is in that culture. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, how do they beat that out of you? Or how do they \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0They beat that \u2013 you said it. They beat it out of you. So, if you\u2019re in SERE School, you\u2019re talking about being a gray man. If you\u2019re the tallest \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is that? That\u2019s \u2013 help me out. What does \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape. It\u2019s a month-long torture school where you wanna be the gray man. If you\u2019re not the gray man, you\u2019re being beaten; phone books, hoses, starvation, cold water, locked inside of cages, locked inside of boxes that you can\u2019t take a full breath in, locked inside of a box that you can\u2019t stand up in, that you can\u2019t stretch in, being pissed on Getting put in a pond that\u2019s frozen, and making you squat so your tiny little dick and the balls which are essentially up inside of your stomach are barely touching, and breaking the ice, and you have to stand there in a half-squat with the water just playing with what\u2019s left of your tiny penis with somebody making fun of you while you\u2019re doing it. You\u2019re like, oh, look at his little dick. And why are you taller than I am tall? Oh, and then they beat you again. So, they beat it out of you. You\u2019ll get good at it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m trying to think of how to segue here. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Mental toughness \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now, when \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 it can be taught. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 is it considered graduating from, say, Ranger School? What is that moment? Where does that come after that particular \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0So, there\u2019s a bunch of phases in the Q Course. Once you get selected and you start the Q Course, you have small unit tactics. So, it\u2019s learning how to be a guerilla war fighter. And then from there you have to learn your job. So, you\u2019re in 18 Bravo, I\u2019m in 18 Bravo, Special Forces weapons sergeant. I have to learn everything about every single foreign weapon. It\u2019s how to assemble and disassemble a DShK, and then an American M2, and then an AK-47, an M4, an M21, an M14. I need to know all these weapons, how to assemble, how to disassemble. If you put all the parts into a box, I can pick all the parts out and figure out which gun is which, and then put them together. I can close my eyes. I can do it with every single American gun, so that if you send me to a country and all we have access to is local indigenous guns, it\u2019s cool. We\u2019re good with these. And I know how to work it, and how to clean it, and how to operate it. So, that\u2019s my job. The security of my team, also an 18 Bravo skill set. And then from there, you would \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What does security mean in this context? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Right now in this room that we\u2019re in, where would I set up early warning? Am I gonna bribe the bum that\u2019s on the street corner that\u2019s watching the front door? Or the guy that\u2019s at the front desk that let me in here and pushed the elevator button. Is he gonna have my direct cell phone line? But if I go to the Dominican Republic to do a counter human trafficking mission, who am I bribing? How am I protecting my team? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I got it. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Or if I\u2019m in country, or if I\u2019m in Afghanistan, or if I\u2019m in Iraq, what is the outside cordon? If I\u2019m gonna level all the bushes, and then I\u2019m gonna put up a high fence, and then I\u2019m gonna have mines in between the high fence and the mid fence. And then from the mid fence to my security positions where I have machine guns positioned with air locked in sectors of fire. So, by the time you get to my little hut in the middle, it\u2019s been a pretty bad fight. I\u2019m supposed to be able to think of all that. I\u2019m a security consultant, but for 12 Special Forces guys when everybody around us wants to kill us. So, you\u2019ve done SUT, Small Unit Tactics, guerilla warfare, you\u2019ve learned your job. Then you go and you apply it in a phase called Robin Sage, which is the coolest phase there is. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Robin Sage? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Robin Sage. You go to a country called Pineland and you are embedded with 11 other Special Forces guys. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now, is that a nickname for a real country or is it a simulation? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It\u2019s a simulation and it\u2019s a very Vietnam-era simulation or North Iraq pre-war with the Kurds about to fight Saddam. They put you in and they have 100 role players that are your indigenous fighting force, your militia. And you\u2019re trying to train them; you\u2019re trying to prepare them. You set up a base of operations that they\u2019re gonna be fighting out of and you start running military operations to overthrow a government, to battle a local other insurgency, a competitive warlord, so that we have the hope of implementing democracy. And then help them write a constitution. And then help them put people into government that can run the country appropriately. And there are very intentional design problems that come up in this phase. But it\u2019s a full \u2013 you pack your rucksack with your food and your water, and you jump out of an airplane into the middle of a forest. And you link up with the local Gs and you start conducting this month, two month long exercise. You finish that, you go to SERE school. You graduate SERE school; you finally get to go to being awarded your Green Beret. And then you step into an ODA and they\u2019re like, you suck. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s an ODA? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Special Forces Operation Detachment Alpha. It\u2019s the A-Team. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I got it. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Where the ODA is the A-Team. And they say go sit in a corner and open your eyes, open your ears, and shut your mouth. And you do that for a year. Then you get to start work. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, you get to start work. At what point \u2013 so I was doing some reading and, again, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, the guy who once you graduated Ranger School, a place that starves you and denies you sleep for over two months, took a fight six days later in the IFL. Why would you do such a thing? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I\u2019m stupid. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I get it. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I think we have a recurring theme here, right? God, you\u2019re just a dumb person. You\u2019re a smart person, Tim. And then across the table, there\u2019s this other person that\u2019s super stupid. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I mean, it seems to have worked for you so far. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Hurry up and fail, right? I graduated from Ranger School as an honor grad, which is \u2013 of the 400-500 people that went, the 200-300 that graduated, there are three that are selected; one for the NCOs, one for the officers, and one as an overall, as the best rangers of that class. So, I graduate. I actually fought in the Army Combatives Tournament, which is one of the, I think, most grueling unknown tournaments in the world. I fought that the Friday, Saturday, Sunday \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What is it? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It is a three-day tournament. You win on Thursday. Friday, it\u2019s all grappling. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Who are the contestants or the combatants? Where are they from? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Combat arms of all branches of service. So, Navy Seals, Green Berets, Army Rangers, 101st Airborne, 82nd Airborne, infantrymen; anybody that kicks ass for a living can come and fight in the Combatives Tournament. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0The unknown kumite of the military. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. So, first day is all grappling. It\u2019s like a grappling tourney. If you win that day, you go to the next day, which is \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Are the rules sports jiu-jitso? Are they different? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Similar to sports jiu-jitso. There\u2019s no pulling guard, you can slam, you can knock out people \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0With a slam or a throw. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 with a slam or a throw, so very combat-focused grappling. You win that, you move to the next day, which is Pancrase rules, which is limited striking. You can kick to the head, open palm to the head, closed fist to the body, knees to the body, and then grappling. All submissions are in. If you win that day, then you move into the third day, which is full MMA rules, and it\u2019s like a UFC fight, but you\u2019re in your uniform. So, you\u2019re still fighting in \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, right, in your gear. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 in your gear the whole time. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Are there any rule differences between the MMA rules, per say, in this tournament and regular MMA rules? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0No, they\u2019re pretty similar to UFC rules. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Got it, more so than a pride. So, you\u2019re not allowed to kick on the ground. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0No. So, that was the day I went to Ranger School. I weighed in on Thursday. I fought Friday, Saturday, Sunday; won my third Army Combatives Tournament, and the only person to ever win it three times. And then Sunday night, I checked into Ranger School. I went to Ranger School, graduated honor grad \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How much later was that? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0The same day. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Oh, I got it, okay. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, finished Sunday from the Combatives Tournament, iced my hands, and then checked into Ranger School that same day, and started Ranger School that Sunday night. Two-and-a-half months later, I graduate from Ranger School, honor grad, and then eight days later, I\u2019m fighting Dante Rivera in the UFC \u2013 or in the IFL. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Now, did you \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0[Inaudible] [00:42:17] that\u2019s really dumb. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0But did you go into that particular fight, did you commit to that fight because you wanted to win, because you wanted to see if it was possible to do such a thing after the experience of Ranger School? Did you just commit so long ago that you were like, oh, shit, here it is? I mean, aside from you saying it\u2019s stupid, but I know you\u2019re not a stupid. I mean, so what was the thought process? What were you hoping to get out of that? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Right now, if somebody kicked in the front door of this room and ten Mexican cartel guys run in, sicarios with their masks pulled over, what do you think I would do? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do I think you would do? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I think you\u2019d probably go straight for it. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0For sure, right? I\u2019m tearing out eyes, I\u2019m biting out cheeks, I\u2019m taking this glass right here and it\u2019s going through the first dude\u2019s eye. I\u2019m gonna take that stand right there and I\u2019m gonna use it as a baseball bat. I\u2019m gonna make it a choke point right there by the hallway, where it\u2019s like we\u2019re in Thermopylae and see if you guys can get past us, like the 300. That\u2019s just the spirit of the fight. And I think you have to test the spirit of the fight. When I graduated from Ranger School, I got the call a couple of days later, could you fight in the IFL, which was a new promotion that was on Fox. I knew I was gonna already be heading to combat. And the reason I had to go to Ranger School was I had just gotten back from Iraq and my boss, John McPhee, the Sheriff of Baghdad, he told me I was a piece of shit. And he said that I had no business being in a unit like the one that we were in because we were in a very special unit within Special Forces. And that I didn\u2019t have the leadership, and I didn\u2019t have the experience, and I didn\u2019t have the military bearing to be in that unit, and that I could maybe get a chance if I went to Ranger School and I graduated honor grad. I knew I was gonna be heading back to combat, so I not only needed to prove to him that I was a good leader, but I was also tough enough that I deserved to be there. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Just if I can hit pause for a second, why did he say that? I mean, with the degree with which you\u2019re comfortable disclosing, what happened that would lead him to say that? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0There are a lot of little things. We\u2019re on a night where we\u2019re trying to kill one of the most evil dudes in all of the war; we\u2019re in a war for 16 years, al-Zarqawi. Remember the deck of cards? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I do, yeah. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, he was an ace. He\u2019s a bad dude. He had strung up Americans from bridges and set them on fire. He drug dudes down the road, strapped behind a car that he\u2019d stolen from the Americans. He was notorious for posing with pictures with dead Americans in front of him, holding their guns like he was an African trophy hunter. Even the movie American Sniper with Chris Kyle; Chris Kyle was going after his henchmen, lower level guys. My unit was going after him. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Zarqawi? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, going specifically after Zarqawi. And there were nights where we\u2019re supposed to have eight helicopters. So, the whole assault force is gonna be going, right? And then error, or the mechanic, or something came up and we only had six. So, my team sergeant\u2019s like, alright, here\u2019s the new load plan. Tim, you\u2019re not gonna go. Little check on my ego; that sucks, why can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m faster, I\u2019m stronger, I\u2019m definitely the juggernaut of the team. I\u2019m outshooting you guys on the range right now. I\u2019m outfighting you guys every morning in training. Why am I not going? Like a little petulant child; like a spoiled bitch brat; red-headed idiot. Retrospectively looking, that\u2019s what I sounded like. Like, no, John, why can\u2019t I go? So, I get \u2013 there were lots of little, tiny things that I did there; that he was giving me a chance to prove, okay, got it. When you guys get back, I\u2019m gonna have all your gear clean, everything\u2019s gonna be ready to go, so you can drop your gear off and go straight to bed and get some sleep after a long night of gun fighting. But instead I\u2019m bitching that I don\u2019t get to go; a bunch of examples like that. And I could probably tell you ten. Or the spirit of me; I just wanna be in the fight, but it\u2019s a team, right? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0We\u2019re only as good as our weakest link and I\u2019m being the weakest link. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How much of the \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0And we\u2019re getting exposed here. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, no, no. I mean, I\u2019m fascinated by all this. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I told you I\u2019d tell you whatever. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, I\u2019ve been \u2013 Tim Kennedy:\u00a0And then you\u2019re gonna hold it against and everybody\u2019s gonna be like, pffft, you\u2019re gonna be friends with that guy. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m not gonna hold it against you. Looking back then, how much of those instances \u2013 so you\u2019re not part of the load plan. Do you think it was because you weren\u2019t qualified to be part of the load versus I wanna see how Tim responds? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Both, I\u2019m sure it was both. I mean, there were times where I know he specifically put me on a load plan that I didn\u2019t need to be on just to see how I\u2019d perform. And the very next day wouldn\u2019t put me \u2013 okay, I\u2019m not gonna put you on the helicopter assault force, the HAF, I\u2019m gonna put you on the GAF, the ground assault force. And I was like, I don\u2019t wanna be on the ground. So, how about you shut your face, you go out to that M2 50 Cal. machine gun, you start doing the head space and timing, making sure it\u2019s clean, making sure all the ammo\u2019s stacked perfectly so when you\u2019re on it and if you get in a gun fight, everything\u2019s gonna go so perfectly for you, but instead you\u2019re bitching. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right, right. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0And I know he did that. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, then he gives you the kinda verbal report card that you described, and you have this IFL coming up, and you feel like you need to show what? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I think I wanted to show myself that spirit of the fight. So, I come back. I not only graduated as honor grad, I also get the leadership award, which is the thing I wanted the most. So, all of Ranger School is like, okay, you\u2019re the best leader of this whole entire class. But I get back to the team \u2013 I\u2019ve got a little bit more military bearing, I got my Ranger tab on here sewn with white thread because I graduated during winter and we walked through snow, which only rarely happens. So, I\u2019m feeling pretty awesome, but I haven\u2019t lost my fight. I kinda wanted to show him that I\u2019m still that same bulldog. I\u2019m still that same pit bull. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I still have the things you liked. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, like that. I haven\u2019t changed as a person and I\u2019m gonna \u2013 who\u2019s this Dante Rivera? A Renzo Gracie brown or black belt that is undefeated. Neat, I\u2019m gonna pound him into oblivion. And I\u2019ll come back to the team on Monday and start getting ready to go to Afghanistan. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright. So, you\u2019ve been starved, denied sleep for two months. You take this fight. You go into the fight. What happens? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I pound him into oblivion. He quit \u2013 he tapped from strikes. I put him in every single position and for a round and a half, I just punched him in the face; from our feet, from the ground, picked him up, put him on the back of his head. When guys graduate Ranger School, a lot of guys don\u2019t walk for months. Their legs are so destroyed. They\u2019re so malnourished. They\u2019re so sleep deprived. The inside of their legs are so chafed and rubbed raw. They\u2019ll actually get \u2013 in the military, you get a medical release where you don\u2019t have to show up for PT test or any physical activity, physical training in the morning because they know you\u2019re so jacked up. And they\u2019ll give you that for months after Ranger School. So, I wanted to go into a fight a week and a half after graduating Ranger School and scare the living crap out of everyone. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You did. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0A couple of questions that I think are tangentially related, but I was actually very curious to talk about a few things. Briefly, walkout music; what have you used and why? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I used to walk out to the most fun, most disarming song I possibly could; like, \u201cDo you really want to hurt me, do you really want to make me cry?\u201d And I\u2019d sing it to them as I was walking out. I was pointing at them. And I\u2019d get in the ring, I\u2019m still pointing at them, maybe batting my eyes, maybe blowing them kisses, just to mess with them. And I\u2019d do a bunch of different songs like that all the time. And then my friend, Nick Palmisciano from Ranger Up, he\u2019s like, hey, man, do you know the origin of the song Rooster? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alice In Chains? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. And I was like, yeah, right. It\u2019s a rooster \u2013 he\u2019s like, it\u2019s about a machine gunner in Vietnam. He\u2019s writing to his dad who was in Vietnam and would carry the M16 machine gun for the 101st. I was like, no. Are you serious? The forgotten war with the forgotten soldiers; the time when the American people were so disenchanted with what the military was doing, fighting for freedom, trying to destroy Communism. And I was like, okay. I\u2019m gonna walk out to this every day. So, the last half of my career, I would always walk out to that song, Rooster. And as a homage or a tribute to not just Vietnam, not just POWs, not just machine gunners, not just infantrymen, but for everybody everywhere that\u2019s ever fought in a fight for something that\u2019s bigger and greater than them with no thanks, no appreciation. Because I wasn\u2019t there fighting for me, I was there fighting for everybody else besides me at that point. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And we were chatting a little bit before hitting record today and I asked you what would make this a successful interview looking back a few months from now? And I might get the exact words wrong, but you said it would be nice if people would stop dying. You talked about helping people become harder to kill. So, how do people listening \u2013 how do you suggest to people listening who may be \u2013 let\u2019s assume they\u2019re in not couch-potato shape, 150 pounds overweight, but that they\u2019re non-athletes who are in reasonable shape, but have no military experience, haven\u2019t been exposed to any, maybe, real what they would consider physical hardship in a long time, how does someone like that, if they think to themselves I would like to become harder to kill, what would your program or recommendations look like for them? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0One of the hardest things about me trying to inspire and encourage people to train is they look at me and they\u2019re like, that guy\u2019s freaking savage. He\u2019s a Special Forces sniper, Ranger-qualified Green Beret that\u2019s been to combat 12 times, fought in the UFC, ranked top ten in the world. He\u2019s a black belt in a handful of martial arts. But I\u2019m the exact same person as the other seven billion people on the planet, right? I didn\u2019t grow up with any kryptonite in the fridge. There\u2019s nothing that is different about me in any way, shape, or form. I just work. And I\u2019m just fighting \u2013 at this point I\u2019m fighting for not even 1 percent to get 1 percent better. I\u2019m fighting for percentages of a percent; incrementally decimals, the tiniest little bits, just for that much of an improvement. I long for the day where I would get dramatically faster in a month. That if I was 20 percent body fat, I could be 18 percent body fat; do you know how freaking cool that would be? Right now, if I could just lose 2 percent fat. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Meaning you\u2019re envious of the people who have more as a percentage to gain if they started doing things in terms of training and so on. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0But you just said it; if they just started doing things. That\u2019s it. All you have to do is start. So, to everybody, where do I start? Man, anything. You could get up \u2013 if you don\u2019t walk around \u2013 if you haven\u2019t gotten up and walked around your block a couple of times, do that. If you haven\u2019t Googled where the closest martial art gym is, whether it\u2019s judo, whether it\u2019s jiu-jitso, whether it\u2019s Muay Thai, whether it\u2019s wrestling. It doesn\u2019t matter. If you haven\u2019t done it, try it. If you\u2019ve never gone to a shooting range and shot, give it a whirl. If you\u2019ve been eating fried food for three meals, three dinners, out of the week, try two. Just anything will make you just that much better. And then those little, tiny decisions start building on top of each other and then, sooner or later, you look back and you don\u2019t even recognize the person that you are. There\u2019s just this beautiful change where like, oh my God, I can see my dick, I can see my feet, or my wife for the first time in five years. I saw her look at me when I got up and I walked out of the room. And not looked at me like, thank God that guy\u2019s getting up and leaving. But like, goddamn, that guy looked good. When was the last time in some people\u2019s lives that they felt that way about the person they\u2019d been living with for ten years? Make that girl fall in love with you again. Impress the fuck out of her. When was the last time that you picked up both your kids and ran to the play gym with them hoisted on your shoulders? And put one up on the other one. The other one, you\u2019re holding. You hand them on the play gym. That\u2019s some massive masculine shit. You\u2019re just playing with your kids on a play gym. But there are these opportunities and there are so many of them for us just to embrace our potential. I mean, you know more about it better than almost anyone on the planet because you\u2019ve pushed that limit so many times in so many different ways, both intellectually and physically. There\u2019s so much unrealized potential. Back to me at 21 years old; a little piece of shit, self-absorbed, at the centric prick. Unrealized potential; there\u2019s 120-140 million Americans right now that just has total unrealized potential. Just go \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Whatever that is. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 get started, just start. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, if they wanted to, for instance, develop on top of some of the physical training, the ABCs, the basic literacy of survival. Let\u2019s say they live in an urban environment. What might those be? I mean, taking a two or three-day CPR class, EMT stuff. You mentioned active shooter defense, which I think is particularly relevant in some respects, but what would some of those ABCs be? If someone\u2019s like, you know what? I really wanna spend, let\u2019s say, a weekend \u2013 every weekend for the next eight weeks amassing some of these skills. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I mean, I\u2019ll just say A and B. A is keep the blood in the good guys. And B is let the blood out of the bad guys. That\u2019s it. Alright? If they\u2019re innocent people, they\u2019re cops, they\u2019re firefighters, they\u2019re school children, bunch of people dancing at a nightclub, and somebody comes in, starts trying to shoot people, we wanna keep the blood inside of those people. Alright? The blood, we only have a finite amount of it. Blood stays in the body of the good people. And then the bad guys, you want all of the blood in them, out of them in whatever way you can. I don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a knife. I don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a gun. I don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a brick. I don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a bottle. That person needs to stop hurting people. So, yeah, that might be CPR. That might be learning how to put on a tourniquet. That might be learning how to prevent it from happening entirely, which is situational awareness. My good friend Shane and I, when we go out to eat here in Austin, we almost play games; biometrics and atmospherics, where we\u2019re sitting in a restaurant and we look at everybody in the room. Well, the first thing we do is identify potential threats in our threat assessments. And then we figure out where the guns are in the room. Who\u2019s the guy that is wearing the come-and-take-it shirt, that has the fanny pack, or that has that bulge on his right hip, or that has that appendix carrier? It\u2019s like, dude, that guy is not Dirk Diggler. He is not that big. There\u2019s something in the front of his pants. And then we start making assumptions about who\u2019s in the room. The two people that are sitting together that kind of are awkwardly interacting; is this their first date, is this a business meeting, is it the first time that they\u2019ve ever been alone, or are they married and they\u2019re not supposed to be \u2013 they\u2019re not married to each other, and meeting up for the first time. But we start making these assumptions. And then we develop another skill set, which is I go up and I start chatting these people up. I\u2019m like, hey, what\u2019s going on? Is that your truck out there? Man, I love those rims. And in a disarming way, start eliciting, very passively, information out of them to confirm or \u2013 to prove us right or wrong in the assumptions that we\u2019ve made thus far. So, it\u2019s developing two things simultaneously. But that is the first element of being safe, is being aware of your surroundings. Knowing where I\u2019m gonna run. Knowing where the out is, where the exit is, where my car is parked, where a threat is gonna come from. What\u2019s the most likely course of action? What\u2019s the most dangerous course of action? If I\u2019m at a taco place, the most dangerous course of action is somebody coming and setting a bomb off. The most likely course of action is just somebody coming up and being like, hey, give me the money in the register. But I need to think about what the different degrees are of what the threats possibly could be. My kids never know that all this \u2013 maybe they have a clue. They\u2019re smart. But they never think about this stuff. They just know that they\u2019re safe; that I have a way to get out. The backpack that\u2019s right here next to me that has a gun in it, that has two tourniquets, and it has an IFAK in it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What\u2019s an IFAK? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0An Individual First Aid Kit. So, even all of us right here, I have enough stuff, if all of you guys got shot, to plug your wounds. I\u2019ve got my backpack right here and a good gun with an extra magazine. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0 What type of a gun, just out of curiosity? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It\u2019s a GLOCK 43, but I\u2019ve got good frangible rounds and a couple extra magazines. So, we\u2019d be alright. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Alright. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It\u2019s tricked out though; good sites, good trigger, good barrel, because I don\u2019t wanna fight fair, because I wanna cheat in every way. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, it makes me think of \u2013 I think I\u2019m getting this right. I think it\u2019s Hackworth. That makes sense, right? That\u2019s a real name. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0It sounds like a real name. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, if you find yourself in a fair fight, you didn\u2019t plan your mission properly. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. I think my favorite fight in the world would be the dude\u2019s laying on his bed asleep and \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0There it is. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Right behind me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Just in case I make any odd moves. Do you find it \u2013 what is your emotional state when you\u2019re doing these types of checks? Is it playful? Is it serious? Is it stressful? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0No, it\u2019s living. It\u2019s freedom. It\u2019s freeing. So, I had this huge level of awareness, where it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m radar; ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. And when I see something that\u2019s off \u2013 in the military, everything is uniform. Everybody wears the same thing. Everybody dresses the same. Everybody makes their bed the same. And that\u2019s so when you look at something that is off, your eye catches it right away. That\u2019s why everything\u2019s uniform in the military. Did you know that? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0So, it\u2019s easier to see when something\u2019s wrong because everything looks the same. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Makes perfect sense. Yeah, right, it makes perfect sense. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0So, have you ever worked counterfeiting stuff? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0I\u2019m sorry? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Counterfeiting? So, if I was trying to find \u2013 the easiest way to find a counterfeit bill is to put it with a whole bunch of bills that I know are good. So, your eye is like, well, that one looks \u2013 Tim Ferriss:\u00a0It\u2019s the one thing that sticks out. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0That one looks weird. The color\u2019s off or the dimensions aren\u2019t right, or the paper doesn\u2019t feel right, or compared to these other 100 bills, this one \u2013 that one\u2019s wrong. So, it\u2019s the exact same. What you have to do is you have to train your mind what normal is. So, in Austin, where it\u2019s South by \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve got a little bit more traffic. We were talking about it. That is a very casual way of being situationally aware. That\u2019s setting up the sample of what is normal. So, then when something is off, when something\u2019s weird, when something\u2019s just a little bit awry, my eye goes from awareness to assessing. I start looking specifically at that thing; that guy that\u2019s wearing the white muslin prayer robes that\u2019s swearing. Everybody else, they\u2019re holding beers. They\u2019re like, hey, here, let\u2019s do a selfie. Okay, let\u2019s hashtag South by Southwest. You\u2019re like, that\u2019s normal. Even though, unfortunately, that\u2019s normal. That one thing looks off. We can see that very clearly because we know what normal is for what\u2019s happening around us. So, the first thing is kinda be learning about cultures, learning about the areas that you\u2019re living, the demographics, the socio-economic classes, the races that should be there. I do that to everywhere I go. I just came from Ocala, Florida. That was the last place that I was in. And I know that percentages of races, who should be there with what kinds of cars people should drive. That it\u2019s 73 percent white, and of the remaining 27 percent, half of them are Mexican. And then the other remaining 13, 12 percent are split between black and Asian. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Where do you get that information? Is that the State Department stuff? Wikipedia? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, it\u2019s on the census. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, yeah. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I mean, that\u2019s all available online. And it\u2019s one little search. And that\u2019s just a couple of quick, little numbers so that you can kinda wrap your head around it. But if I go to Walmart, I\u2019m gonna have a different crowd than if I go to Target; two different people shop there; different socio-economic classes. Different types of cars are supposed to be parked there. But in the parking lot, where am I gonna find the drugs? Where am I gonna find the guy that has the guns? The guy that\u2019s parked in the back trying to get a blowjob; the guy that\u2019s parked around the side of the building where there are no lights and maybe a camera that\u2019s busted because he\u2019s about to do a drug deal. So, just knowing how people work; okay, I\u2019m not gonna park there. Then I\u2019m gonna park here. It\u2019s really simple stuff. So, then when I say it\u2019s freeing, all that stuff happens so effortless now that now it\u2019s just \u2013 I\u2019m just at lunch with my buddy Shane and we\u2019re just talking shit about people Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right, right, right. And it just happens. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0And it just happens. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Why did you re-enlist in the Special Forces? The date I have is April 16th 2017. Why did you re-enlist? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Man, I don\u2019t like losing fights. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, I imagine. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, I\u2019ve lost a few. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Some close ones too. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0They\u2019re like a thorn, like a burr in the back of my neck. It\u2019s always just irritating. I hope to the day I die that they irritate me. And we\u2019re losing a war. I fought in places like Ramadi, and Sadr City in Baghdad, and Fallujah, and those were cities that good friends of mine got hurt in. And I was fighting next to Iraqis that wanted freedom so badly. They wanted to have a chance at just living. Muslims, Christians, didn\u2019t matter; just give us a chance. And all of us are fighting together for that chance. And then all those cities that we fought and that we won, ISIS comes in because of policies, because of presidents, because of secretary of defenses, and bad decisions, bad war planning, and we lose ground. And I can\u2019t explain to you how bad that hurts guys like me to see things that they fought for, and they bled for, and they got blown up in just given back to an enemy that\u2019s even more evil than the evil that we won it from. I\u2019ll take ten Saddams over an ISIS. And I see Mad Dog Mattis is coming back as Secretary of Defense. And I see not just him, but other people being put into positions of authority within my chain of command that believe in a winning. And I like winning. As much as I don\u2019t like losing, I really like winning. And this is gonna be chance for us to be winning again. In a year, what was the ground that ISIS has had, they\u2019ve lost 99 percent of it in one year. That\u2019s winning. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do you attribute that to? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0To kicking ass. I mean, it\u2019s plain and simple. If you take a bunch of pit bulls, and you put them in cages, and then you let chihuahuas out, they\u2019re never gonna go \u2013 and you\u2019re supposed to be catching wild boars, that chihuahua is never gonna do anything, right? It\u2019s gonna bark and then it\u2019s gonna run back. But if you open those cages, there\u2019s only one thing those pit bulls know how to do, is just kick ass. And that\u2019s all that happened. We\u2019re just like, okay, we\u2019re gonna go I saw that you killed some of our Green Berets in Southeast Afghanistan. Cool. We\u2019re gonna drop the biggest bomb that\u2019s not nuclear that we have in our arsenal on top of you, which is what we did. It\u2019s like, oh, you killed some Green Berets in Niger. Neat. We\u2019re gonna fly in 800 shooters and wipe all of Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS off of the map entirely in your country. It\u2019s like, oh, you had Fallujah, Sadr City, Ramadi; not only are we gonna take them back, but we\u2019re gonna take them back and we\u2019re gonna put conservative Muslim leaders in there that are so far from fanatic radicals that girls get to go back to school. I mean, do things that would just irritate radicals so bad. They have freedom again. And so what I attribute it to is giving the guys that know what they\u2019re supposed to do the opportunity to do it. That\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How old are your \u2013 you have two kids? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I have three. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You have three. And how old are your kids? Tim Kennedy:\u00a016, 15, and 2. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0What do you say to them if \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t know the nature of the re-enlistment and your activities, but if you\u2019re going to be at risk, how do you explain the decision and so on to them? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I\u2019m at risk. I\u2019m deploying two times in the next year; one time really, really, really soon. And I\u2019m glad we got to sit down and chat because I\u2019m gonna be gone for the next year. They know that this is what I was made to do and they love it when I get to do it. They\u2019re proud of me in the sense that if they walk onto a military base with me, everybody is walking up to shake my hand. It\u2019s different than being in Austin where people wanna come up and take selfies. They wanna come up and shake my hand because they know what I\u2019ve done and they know what I\u2019m gonna do. And that makes them proud; a 15 and 16-year-old girl, that\u2019s awesome. A 2-year-old is just like, I have poop in my pants. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Right, a different conversation. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0But is he gonna understand Dad being gone for six months? No, he\u2019s gonna be pissed. And he\u2019s gonna take it out on my wife. My girls are gonna \u2013 they\u2019re gonna be pissed, but they also know that I would rather be fighting that there than in front of their school. I\u2019ve tracked down guys that were riding down the street on motorcycles throwing acid on little girls that were walking to school because they didn\u2019t think girls should go to school. I want that to happen nowhere on the planet and in the places that it does, I wanna go there and stop it from happening. I don\u2019t want that to be here. That\u2019s on a rise in the UK right now. It\u2019s increased by almost 1,000 percent as people are trying to prevent girls from going to school, specifically with acid. Okay, send me to the UK. I can fix this. You\u2019re not gonna like how I\u2019m gonna do it, but I can fix it. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0How do you think about risk? And maybe that\u2019s not the right word, but you get deployed, ostensibly something bad could happen to you. How do you think about that yourself? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0 When we\u2019re stripped down \u2013 you go all the way back to the most raw, exposed version of that Special Forces soldier and they start building those cornerstones in the foundation, we\u2019re risk adverse. We\u2019re trying to set ourselves up for success in every imaginable way so that we can\u2019t fail. If and when things start failing, there\u2019s so much training, and there\u2019s so much rehearsal, and there\u2019s so much practice, and there\u2019s so much strategy, and there\u2019s so much preparation that that quote of I\u2019m gonna be the hardest person somebody ever tries to kill \u2013 imagine fighting 12 of me, or 24 of me, or 36 of me. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No thanks. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0With an AC-130 flying over us, and an F-16, and a couple Apaches on standby, you\u2019re not gonna deal with one of me, you\u2019re gonna deal with me and all of my friends that have been born and bred to do this one thing, which is give people a chance to fight for their freedom. You don\u2019t wanna fuck with us. We really like that freedom thing. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Do you have a contingency plan if something happens to you? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0You do? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah. My family will be very well off, probably better financially. All the guys that we\u2019re with, they know \u2013 these are horrible conversations to have and things that I don\u2019t want my family to know, but if I break my back or if I\u2019m so badly burned, to what degree are they gonna try to save me? That\u2019s a conversation we have. Maybe don\u2019t put me on that bird; maybe just let me die right here. But that\u2019s a conversation for me and my friends. I\u2019ve had dudes be like, alright, listen. All I want you to do is take my cell phone, smash it on the ground, go take my laptop, smash that on the ground, and then make sure my body goes to my wife. Which is funny, but these are conversations that we have. And everybody\u2019s is different. But as a team, sure as shit, I\u2019m gonna make sure that dude\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not only gonna smash his laptop, I\u2019m probably gonna microwave it and then I\u2019m gonna throw it in the ocean, or the river, or Tigris. Yes, we have contingencies. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0If you could put one word, question, short message, anything on a billboard just to get it out to millions or billions of people, metaphorically speaking, what might you put on such a billboard? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0One word? Tim Ferriss:\u00a0No, no. It could be one word, it could be a sentence, it could be a question, could be anything, could be a long quote that you like. It could be anything. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I just want people to work. We\u2019re in a society of \u2013 a culture of entitlement where it\u2019s like everybody wants the fast, easy, quick fix for everything. Like, oh, I\u2019m sick. Give me a prescription. I\u2019m fat. Give me that quick, easy diet. I\u2019m not successful at work. Just give me that promotion even though I don\u2019t deserve. Everything is just on the far side of hard work. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019d put. Everything you want is on the far side of work. Freedom; the only place freedom exists is on the far side of hard work. The only place success exists, financially, sexually, in relationships emotionally; it\u2019s on the far side of work. If you want a good marriage, fucking work for it. You want to have amazing sex? Cool, work for it. Unless you\u2019re this fictional character in \u2013 I don\u2019t even know the movies. Like Dirk Diggler, right? Was that based on a real guy? Was he even good at sex? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll tell you what. Somebody that really wants and is committed to being good at it is gonna be good at it. And that goes for everything; success, sleep, even sleep. You want good sleep? Earn it. Go work for it. Put your iPad away. Go eat a good, healthy dinner, work hard all day long for 12 hours, and play with your kids, and sweat, and fuck your wife. Give her 15 orgasms so you fall over in the bed and you\u2019re just passed out for eight hours. That\u2019s some good sleep right there. So, on the far side of hard work. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Everything you want is on the far side of hard work. We could keep going for hours, and hours, and hours, and I think that we might \u2013 I was gonna say we should do a round two, but it might be a year from now. I\u2019m okay with that. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I\u2019ll be a pretty \u2013 when I come back from combat \u2013 because you\u2019re such a \u2013 right now, we\u2019re having these \u2013 not existential conversations, but we\u2019re kinda getting philosophically \u2013 projecting what we\u2019d be doing or billboards of inspiration, I\u2019ll be a raw asshole in a year from now after being overseas. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Well, open invitation. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0I\u2019ll talk anytime with you. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Yeah, different conversation. Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Yeah, probably. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0But where can people learn more about you? What would you like them to check out and where can they do that? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Freedom\u2019s awesome, so believe in it and go vote for it. And then you can find me \u2013 timkennedymma is me for everything; Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. I try to get on there a lot. I am pretty exposed, so if you wanna \u2013 this is not a \u2013 you\u2019ll get a very honest conversation out of me in every way, probably too much of a degree. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Are there any websites you\u2019d like people to take a look at or anything you\u2019d like people to look up? Tim Kennedy:\u00a0Sheepdog Response is \u2013 our motto is make you harder to kill. And we\u2019re trying to make people \u2013 the A and the B, keeping blood in the good and letting blood out of the bad. We\u2019re trying to teach people how to do that. Ranger Up is one of my companies. We make satire military shirts, and jeans, and Woobies Shoes. I\u2019m an entrepreneur like you, but it\u2019s \u2013 nah, just go work for freedom. I\u2019ll work for my companies. I\u2019ll work for my wealth. I\u2019ll work for my everything. I\u2019ll work for my freedom. You go work for yours. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0Take it. Tim, thank you so much for taking the time. And everybody listening, everybody watching, we\u2019ll provide links to everything we\u2019ve talked about as per usual in the show notes of tim.blog/podcast for this episode, every other episode. And until next time, work hard, it matters. And thank you for listening and thank you for watching.

arriving here, and you had a\u00a0gi on, open, and blood running down your face", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, where were you and what happened", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i was not but four miles away from here and we just had the ibjjf world jiu-jitso competition this weekend", "and so last week, we were doing very sports jiu-jitso training, getting people ready for the tournament", "i hate sports jiu-jitso", "i think sports jiu-jitso is the abomination to what martial arts is, where it takes something that\u2019s really cool and then they make it sporty", "it\u2019s like, oh, let\u2019s give some points to do some stupid things", "and then people \u2013 the mutation that evolves \u2013 how it evolves, it loses its balls", "and i don\u2019t like things that had balls and then no longer have balls", "it\u2019s kinda seems like the emasculated man and that\u2019s what jiu-jitso has almost become", "jiu-jitso to me is i\u2019m gonna get in mount or side control", "i\u2019m gonna pick your face up", "i\u2019m gonna smash it into the cement", "and then i\u2019m gonna push your eyes and then i\u2019m gonna bite your cheek off", "that\u2019s jiu-jitso to me because that\u2019s the origin of it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0the gentle art", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, the gentle art", "and so today, we did combat jiu-jitso", "so, just to have a total paradigm shift, just to make people\u2019s heads explode; instead of talking about getting four points for back control, or getting four points for mount, or getting a takedown and getting two, it\u2019s like find a place that you can hold somebody down and then hit them", "and that\u2019s it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i was watching a video in prep for this", "i think it was from sheepdog response and we can talk about it in a second, but you had back control on someone", "you\u2019re right on top of them", "they were all turtled up on the ground and you sort of wiped your fingers on their eyes", "and you\u2019re like, okay, yeah, i just took your eyes out", "so, something along the lines of old man jiu-jitso leads to old men dying or something like that", "but there\u2019s just such a huge delta between the two", "tim kennedy:\u00a0you have to look at the origin of what things are and then the abomination of what they become", "what you see as these really \u2013 the genesis of a martial art was they had to learn how to protect themselves", "or they didn\u2019t have weapons, so they had to create something to fight the dictators that were killing them", "or there were the samurai that were really good with swords", "so, then the ninjas came along; to use stealth because if you fight a ninja head-on, you\u2019re gonna die", "so, let\u2019s create something new", "then over time, that loses what it is", "you have to be \u2013 or competitively practice something to get good at it, so then you can implement sport", "and that\u2019s what kinda differentiates a lot of this different jiu-jitso, or a lot of these different martial arts, are just really tiny little rules", "what\u2019s the difference between judo and jiu-jitso, and jiu-jitso and greco-roman wrestling, and greco-roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling, and collegiate wrestling", "so, they\u2019re very small differences", "that\u2019s to make them a sport", "but if you take those rules away, you get back to what the martial art was, which was how to fight for your life and not get murdered", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, and i think it\u2019s also misleading when people think of the term martial art and they turned it into some type of performance in the art \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, they take body paint and i\u2019m gonna start putting my chest all over this window and i\u2019m doing martial arts", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and it\u2019s actually when you go back to the translation from say \u2013 whether it\u2019s wushu in chinese or any of these bujitso in japanese \u2013 i used to live in japan \u2013 it\u2019s actually martial technique that then got translated to art", "so, it\u2019s lost some of its impact through a mistranslation, in a sense", "and when i look at your career, i saw you fight live in some early strikeforce events when i was living in san jose, and then became fascinated by your military career, which we\u2019ll talk about", "seems like you\u2019re very good at game-time decisions and acting under pressure", "so, i want to talk about training though for a second", "can you talk about what you say to yourself when you train and at least my understanding is it begins with hurry up, dot, dot, dot", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, hurry up and fail", "funny enough, as i send you that picture of me dripping blood out of my face and i have blood already clotted in my mouth, it gets stuck as it starts congealing", "it turns into that gelatin up inside of kinda weird cavities inside of your nose", "so, if you cough, chunks start flying", "as i was trying to explain what it means to train \u2013 so somebody came up to me at the end of practice today", "and they\u2019re like, man, i keep getting tired, or i keep quitting, or i had a couple people that just tapped from the position that i was in \u2013 or that they were in", "and so hurry up and fail is this mantra of i wanna get to the breaking point of where i can\u2019t go on any longer, and i wanna stay there", "because then the next time i train, that wall has moved", "i mean, ever so slightly, but it\u2019s moved", "so, then the next time, i can go in and i can get to that point as hard and as fast as i can, and then i can stay there", "so, then the next time, it\u2019s gonna move", "and repeat until finally, if you look back months later, you\u2019ve progressed so far", "today i was at onnit academy and we did the exact same workout we did two months ago; same weight", "and what two months ago left us on the ground almost heaving in nauseous \u2013 couldn\u2019t stand up, about to throw up; today, we blew through effortlessly", "and juan, shane, and i looked at each other and were like, what are we supposed to do right now", "because we have an extra 16 minutes because we went through it so fast", "so, in two months, there was such a clear change of looking back and seeing like, man, i got bigger, i got faster, i got stronger, and i ultimately got harder to kill", "so, in jiu-jitso, it\u2019s the exact same", "you rush to that breaking point", "and by no means do i wanna say somebody\u2019s gonna break me", "because if somebody can break me, i welcome it, bring it", "i call over the world to try and find people that can do that, so i can find that point where i\u2019m gonna fail", "and then the next time i do it, it\u2019s gonna move", "you know", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, when you then fast-forward to an example of an environment in which the stakes are a little higher \u2013 so i\u2019d love to talk about roger gracie; starting with an r for you non-brazilians out there", "i was chatting with a mutual acquaintance \u2013 actually before we get to mutual acquaintance, i owe credit to the person who made the introduction, who is donald park \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0 love that guy", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 who i went to college with, who used to be a super lightweight blue belt that i could throw around because of judo", "now i can no longer throw him around because he\u2019s a black belt", "and co-owner of a school, which is where you were training today", "what\u2019s the name of the school", "tim kennedy:\u00a0gracie humaita", "i think it\u2019s \u2013 royler gracie is \u2013 it\u2019s in his lineage, royler gracie black belt, but donald park and paulo brandao are the ones that run this school", "and it is a shark tank of passionate people that love family and martial arts", "and that\u2019s what that place is", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and for those of you who don\u2019t want staph infections, also a very clean school", "tim kennedy:\u00a0oh, that\u2019s one of my favorite things", "i\u2019m a huge germophobe \u2013 not a germophobe, but i\u2019m a crazy clean person", "and i walked in today and i could smell bleach", "god, i love that smell, you know", "i actually have a huge infection on my leg right now because i was in florida and i got my leg sliced open on the side of a boat after i smashed a window with a tomahawk", "and my leg got infected from it because the water \u2013 i\u2019m not sure if you know this \u2013 in miami is not really clean", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, right", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "so, i\u2019m cutting my leg open so i can scrub it with iodine so this infection goes away because i also don\u2019t like prescriptions", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright", "well, i can\u2019t leave that and go back to roger gracie immediately, so we\u2019ll get to roger in due time", "so, you\u2019re in a boat, you smash a window with a tomahawk", "what the hell happened", "tim kennedy:\u00a0the boat was on fire and it was sinking", "i didn\u2019t wanna drown, so i smashed a window", "and then i tried to swim out", "and then the glass in the window cut my leg", "and then i got what i think is poop water inside of my cut leg", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what\u2019s the context for that", "tim kennedy:\u00a0well, somebody had pooped in the water, so sorry \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0no, why were you \u2013 why was there broken glass, tomahawk, boat on fire to begin with", "tim kennedy:\u00a0we\u2019re recreating a commercial fisherman\u2019s worst nightmare, which is being on a boat that\u2019s on fire that\u2019s sinking", "and you\u2019re gonna have to make a bunch of decisions at once", "am i gonna try to put the fire out", "am i gonna try to save the boat", "am i gonna start to get my rescue equipment", "am i gonna start trying to find my beacon", "am i gonna start deploying the lifeboat", "am i gonna get my immersion suit", "so, you have a whole bunch of really bad options to choose from and all of those bad options might dictate whether you live or die", "tim ferriss:\u00a0this is for the tv show that you\u2019re \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 finishing up", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yep", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what\u2019s the name of the show", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it\u2019s called hard to kill", "tim ferriss:\u00a0aptly named", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, but not me", "it\u2019s not about me being hard to kill, which i hope i am", "the hard to kill, it\u2019s to pay homage to guys and gals that do these jobs that are in-freaking-sane", "imagine we\u2019re sitting here talking right now", "some random dude just started rappelling down the side of this window to clean our window", "people do that job", "that\u2019s kinda crazy", "and they do it when the wind\u2019s blowing 30-40 miles an hour", "that little crane right there, which doesn\u2019t have an american flag on it \u2013 that vex \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0you don\u2019t seem pleased about it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0no, that vexes me", "i wanna go tear that thing down hulk style and start throwing those construction guys off until they put up an american flag", "oh, they got their little brands up there, whatever those are, don\u2019t care", "if you\u2019re listening right now and you\u2019re a crane operator, i implore you to please put an american flag on your crane", "we want to see it", "alright, so \u2013 oh, i\u2019m getting a cramp in my hamstring", "tim ferriss:\u00a0this is the most action-packed podcast i\u2019ve ever done already", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i need to drink some more water", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how did tim kennedy pull his hamstring", "he was doing a podcast with tim ferriss", "tim kennedy:\u00a0they\u2019re really intense", "you have intense podcasts", "so, we find these jobs that are super dangerous", "and people do them every single day and they embody the spirit of the american people", "they do something that provides, that puts food on tables, that puts gas in cars, that delivers medications to people in nowhere alaska, and these are brave, courageous, fearless people that do the jobs every single day", "and then we find, in that job, their worst nightmare, their worst case scenario, their worst day, and then i go and i do that", "so, i learn about the job", "i learn about the people", "i learn about why they do it", "and then ultimately, how they survive or sometimes even perish, and i go and do that thing, which is dumb", "which leads me \u2013 i\u2019m 20 pounds lighter than i normally am, and i have a bunch of jacked-up cuts all over my body right now, and i\u2019m trying to march on", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you seem good at marching on", "i mean, the common thread that occurs to me at least \u2013 one thing that fascinates me about people in those situations, anyone in very high-pressure situations, is the internal monologue, sort of the self-talk", "which i\u2019m gonna use as a segue to roger gracie", "so roger, for people who don\u2019t know who he is \u2013 chatting with a second mutual acquaintance who i\u2019m not sure if he wants to be named or not, we can talk about who he is afterwards, but he said you could consider roger one of the \u2013 many people would consider him one of the top five jiu-jitso competitors of all time", "would you say that\u2019s a fair statement", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i would put him top three", "tim ferriss:\u00a0top three, alright", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i\u2019d tie him with three other guys", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright, just out of curiosity, who else would be up at the top in your mind", "tim kennedy:\u00a0fortunately, gordon ryan right now is definitely up there", "lovato and without a doubt, i\u2019d have to include new york \u2013 i can\u2019t even remember his name right now", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m sure somebody from the internet will recognize who \u2013 oh, wait a second", "i know who you\u2019re talking about", "you\u2019re talking about marcelo garcia", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, marcelo garcia, yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, that was the marcelo-tine", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, the marcelo guillotine", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "tim kennedy:\u00a0lucien, high elbow", "tim ferriss:\u00a0marcelo\u2019s amazing", "but roger\u2019s in there", "and you fought roger in mma rules \u2013 or under mma rules", "when you\u2019re walking out to enter the octagon to fight someone like that \u2013 and just to flash forward, i mean, the story as it was retold to me, having seen the footage, but it was retold to me by another high-level jiu-jitso practitioner", "he said not only on the feet did you effectively beat the shit out of roger, but on the ground also you were able to do that", "so, two questions; when you\u2019re walking out, are you saying hurry up and fail to yourself on the way out to the octagon", "tim kennedy:\u00a0no, on game day, when i\u2019m putting rounds in my magazines \u2013 so when you put your body armor on, put your helmet on, you do a commo check \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0do a what check", "tim kennedy:\u00a0a commo check, a communication with the radio \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, communications check", "tim kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 on all the different channels and we have your primary, secondary contingent, and emergency channels", "then the very next thing you do is you chamber a round into your pistol because if you do your rifle first, you\u2019ll forget to do your pistol", "so, you do these things and these pre-mission checks in a very specific order so you never miss something", "so, i\u2019m in gun fight with my rifle, my rifle runs out of ammunition, somebody\u2019s charging at me, i go to transition, i forgot to put a round in the chamber", "you think you\u2019d never do that, but you\u2019re about to have \u2013 the helicopter\u2019s getting spun up", "guys are putting their gear on", "you can forget, so you do things very meticulously", "when i put that round in my chamber of my pistol before i start putting a round in the chamber of my rifle, which is the last thing that i do before i start taking tape off of charges or making sure all my grenades are prepped properly, it\u2019s like not today", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m telling myself", "i can fail all the time in training", "i can rush to failure", "i can hurry up and fail at every opportunity when i\u2019m getting ready, but when finally bullets are gonna fly, or i\u2019m gonna walk into that octagon, or i\u2019m gonna kick that door in, not today; not a fucking chance are you gonna beat me on that day", "tim ferriss:\u00a0is that what you repeat to yourself when you step into the octagon and you\u2019re waiting for all the announcing to complete or is there more that goes through your head", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i\u2019m actually waiting for the first time i make a mistake and somebody thinks that they\u2019re gonna do something great", "that i\u2019m gonna get hit the first time", "or in roger\u2019s case, i shot an inside single on him to put him on his back, which nobody thought in my right mind i would do and he got my back", "roger gracie\u2019s best position; roger gracie, if he gets on your back, you\u2019re going to sleep, period", "i got there and i was like, hell yeah", "do you know what\u2019s gonna happen", "i\u2019m gonna get out of here", "i\u2019m gonna start punching you in the face", "and think about what that\u2019s gonna do to him", "tim ferriss:\u00a0psychologically", "tim kennedy:\u00a0psychologically, i\u2019m in the best \u2013 he\u2019s in the best position that he can possibly be in, the thing that he\u2019s the best at, and this little hairy-handed monkey that\u2019s in front of him gets out and starts punching him in the face while he has his back", "you know, he just \u2013 that was the end of the fight", "i was three minutes into the fight and there was nothing he could do psychologically from that point forward because i already beat the thing he did the best", "so, even in my failure, i was like, hell yeah, here i come", "i wish i had blood dripping out of my mouth and sending him pictures later of it because that\u2019s the opportunity to really thrive; to grow and to just scare the freaking shit out of somebody", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i don\u2019t consider myself a fighter at all", "well, i mean, i\u2019m not an accomplished fighter in any capacity, but i enjoy interacting with people who are very good at combat sports", "and you mentioned marcelo earlier", "so, i\u2019ve had a chance to spend time with marcelo simply because his school in new york city is co-owned with a dear friend of mine name josh waitzkin, who, for those who don\u2019t know the name, was the basis for searching for bobby fischer, both the book and the movie, formerly considered a chess prodigy", "and what they did, and continue to do, at that school is they videotape training sessions, sparring sessions with marcelo \u2013 and this is also including during his competitive career", "and people were like, that\u2019s ridiculous", "how would you possibly show your whole hand in a video", "that\u2019s crazy", "and all these other people are really secretive", "and marcelo\u2019s thinking was that doesn\u2019t bother me at all because that\u2019s my game", "it\u2019s like if people try to enter my game, i\u2019m never gonna lose", "i will always win", "yeah, you wanna watch my stuff and try play that hand", "yeah, sure, i would love for you to do that", "and he\u2019s the sweetest guy ever, so i\u2019m using a tone that he would never use", "who are fighters past or present who really impress you", "are there any \u2013 they could be well-known, but i\u2019m particularly interested in names that folks might not recognize as the two or three guys in the marquis lights that have really been seen before", "tim kennedy:\u00a0jeremy horn; he was an old-school guy, but one of chuck liddell\u2019s first losses, if not his only loss by submission, was to jeremy horn", "yeah, chuck\u2019s a ncaa wrestler; the iceman, putting everybody to sleep", "just cool, calm, collected, walks out and you can\u2019t take him down", "he\u2019s just gonna hit you with these bricks for hands", "and he gets on top of jeremy and jeremy just holds onto him; puts him in a head and arm choke in the guard and puts him to sleep", "and waking chuck up because he\u2019s so unconscious, and that was \u2013 he has a really unassuming body shape", "they called him gumby because he\u2019s just \u2013 he doesn\u2019t look like me", "you look at me and you\u2019re like, whoa, i don\u2019t wanna fight that ape", "you look at him and you\u2019re like, well, you can babysit my kids", "can you walk my dog", "so, he\u2019s one of those guys that were just so disarming", "carlos condit is another one where, especially at his prime, he looked like the idiot kid next door that you\u2019d want to mow your lawn and housesit", "and clean dog poop out of the back of your house", "you\u2019re like, he\u2019s just such a nice looking, pleasant, new mexico kid", "but when that bell rang, it was just pure violence everywhere", "he would be elbowing you, spinning kicks, submissions, scrapple; it didn\u2019t matter where the fight went, he\u2019s just gonna fight", "and there\u2019s no \u2013 the only way you can beat him is just being inches or seconds ahead of him in something for the whole, entire duration of the fight", "tim ferriss:\u00a0hard to do", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, really hard to do", "because you\u2019re not gonna knock him out, you\u2019re not gonna submit him, you just have to out-endure him", "and when i say endure, i\u2019m not talking lance armstrong on a bicycle", "i\u2019m talking getting punched in the face for 25 minutes", "that\u2019s a really dumb way to out-endure somebody", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, so this \u2013 you know, i put jacare in that short list too of best grapplers", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i don\u2019t speak portuguese", "i think that\u2019s the crocodile, isn\u2019t it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0jacare; the guy\u2019s an animal", "i remember hearing stories", "i didn\u2019t see this personally, but of him in jiu-jitso tournaments, literally just ripping the arms off \u2013 the fabric arms off of gis because of his strength and grip strength", "what a beast", "so, that leads me to a quote", "and if this is a misquote, please correct it of course, but here we go", "quote, \u201cmy entire life revolves around the concept that i want to be the hardest person someone ever tries to kill", "if you\u2019re going to come and think, oh, i\u2019m gonna kill tim kennedy, you might be able to, but it\u2019s going to be the nastiest, most evil, disgusting, violent affair that you could ever imagine occurring.\u201d how do you develop \u2013 i\u2019ll keep this really broad, but mental toughness and where does that fit in", "or what mental/psychological advantages do you have in life or in battle and how have you developed them", "tim kennedy:\u00a0there are so many metaphors, and phrases, and little clich\u00e9s of \u2013 it\u2019s not the size of the dog, but the size of the fight in the dog", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right, yeah", "tim kennedy:\u00a0right", "it\u2019s not the size of the dog in the fight \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0the dog in the fight \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s the fight of the dog in the fight", "tim ferriss:\u00a0the fight in the dog", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "that is developed", "so, bulls; in the \u201860s and \u201870s, they had bucking bulls", "and they are hard to ride", "so, then what they started doing in the \u201870s and \u201880s, they started finding mexican fighting bulls", "these are mean, nasty bulls and they\u2019re breeding them with the bucking bulls", "so, the bucking bulls are big, powerful bulls", "and then what would happen in the \u201880s and \u201890s, guys used to be able to ride 60, 70, maybe even 80 percent of the time; they\u2019d successfully get their eight seconds", "by the \u201880s, it was down to 50 percent", "right now, it\u2019s down to the 20s and 30s", "the bulls are just bigger, they\u2019re meaner, and they buck just as hard", "and the cowboys are not only scared of how hard they\u2019re gonna buck, but when they get thrown, that bull is turning around to try and murder that cowboy because now they\u2019re mean", "so, it can be trained", "it can be \u2013 in a bull\u2019s case, it\u2019s actually bred", "but in special forces, there are a lot of different special operations units; navy seals and marine recon, i\u2019ll even give a nod to the air force with their jtacs, the army rangers", "army special forces, the green berets", "in the process, once you get past selection, the next six months to ten months, they pretty much just tear away every level of who you are, of your ego", "if we\u2019re gonna go freudian, they\u2019re just stripping away everything down to the most raw element of you as a human", "and that you\u2019re worthless, that you can\u2019t do anything", "and you\u2019re so exposed and you\u2019re so vulnerable at this point that then they can start building a fresh foundation", "and they start putting the cornerstones of never quitting, of always working hard, of planning relentlessly, and strategically looking for every opportunity to never have a fair fight", "because we feel so vulnerable and we feel so exposed, anything could hurt me right now", "fuck, if you fart on me, i might die", "so, i have to have every single advantage strategically", "i need to cheat in every way so i never have a fair fight", "if i\u2019m gonna go and kick a door in and there\u2019s four bad guys in there, cool", "i\u2019m gonna have 250 dudes with me", "we\u2019re all gonna have better guns", "we\u2019re all gonna have better ammo", "we\u2019re gonna have better sites", "we\u2019re gonna have aerial support", "while that may not always be an option, that\u2019s what we want because we never wanna fail again because we felt so raw and exposed", "and that\u2019s different from all other special operations and i think that\u2019s why special forces specifically has been so successful and so unheard of; so unremarkable that nobody knows the quiet professionals, which is our motto", "it means that we\u2019re still successful", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what was the motto", "tim kennedy:\u00a0the quiet professionals", "tim ferriss:\u00a0the quiet professionals", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, let\u2019s talk about how the military entered your life", "and i don\u2019t know the exact timing on this, but it seems like you\u2019re \u2013 let\u2019s start with \u2013 and then you can sort of place us \u2013 9/11", "so, it seems like your life changed quite dramatically around that time", "could you tell us who tim kennedy is at that point in time \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0do we have to", "tim ferriss:\u00a0 \u2013 and what then happened, starting at 9/11", "tim kennedy:\u00a0alright", "well, i\u2019m just gonna tell you a story", "mom, if you\u2019re listening, please stop", "i\u2019m at the pit where chuck trained out of in \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0san luis obispo", "tim kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 san luis obispo", "and i\u2019m training; sweaty, stinky", "and this pretty good looking girl walks in and i was like, hey, girl", "what\u2019s going on", "and she\u2019s like, hey, i\u2019m looking for a guy that fought", "he was the fourth or fifth fight that fought a few weekends ago at the wec \u2013 the world extreme cagefighting fight on \u2013 i think it was on halloween", "i was like, oh, i fought that night", "and she was like, oh yeah, i remember you", "you look familiar", "and i totally didn\u2019t remember her", "and she tells me that she tested positive for hiv and that we\u2019d had a huge orgy that night", "and she\u2019s trying to contact all of her partners that she\u2019s been with in the past few months to have them go get tested, that they might have aids", "that pretty much personifies who i am", "tim ferriss:\u00a0at the time", "tim kennedy:\u00a0at the time, yeah", "i graduated from high school a few years early, was done with college a couple of years early", "at 18, i\u2019m an emt, firefighter", "at 19, i already have my undergrad", "i start grad school and 9/11 happens", "i got two girls pregnant; girls walking into the \u2013 i\u2019m just a talented, wasted piece of shit", "i\u2019m wasted potential in every single sense of the word", "and at the time that all of these things are going wrong and i\u2019m having this realization of i have to do something, i don\u2019t know what that is, a bunch of planes start slamming the buildings, into the pentagon, into the two towers, into some random field in virginia", "and i\u2019m just sitting here watching live these things happen and realizing what a waste of a human i am", "everything was about what jeans am i gonna wear or if i\u2019m gonna bring a good bottle to someplace to impress somebody to be able to hook up with somebody else", "it was just this horrible, humiliating slap in the face of you\u2019re a piece of shit", "what are you gonna do now", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and then what happens", "tim kennedy:\u00a0so, i walk into the recruiter\u2019s office and i say put me on the fastest course i possibly can to the worst place i can go", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright, so you do that", "what do the people around you think of that decision", "tim kennedy:\u00a0my mom was scared", "my dad was proud", "my brother was excited", "all of my friends were just like me; so interested in themselves that it didn\u2019t matter what i was gonna be doing", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right, they were too self-absorbed to really have that much interest", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "my dad, he wasn\u2019t proud yet", "he was exhilarated in the sense that i had a chance", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, in a way, you\u2019d been given a second chance, a reboot opportunity", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, in this case, it was probably my 50th chance", "white privilege is a thing and i had every opportunity to succeed in anything i did", "i was top ten in the world when i was 22 years old as a fighter, 21 as a fighter", "i could\u2019ve done anything and i was just wasting everything", "so, then at this point, it was my dad finally being like, okay, we got another chance", "let\u2019s see how this goes", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, if you could walk us through what happens in the weeks and months after that", "because i\u2019m very \u2013 i mean, i have friends who are both active and at this point certainly more so on the civilian side from military, but i\u2019ve never experienced it myself", "so, what happens from that point forward", "tim kennedy:\u00a0so, to get to special forces, there are a lot of tests; from intelligence tests \u2013 your asvab, your gt test", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what are those", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it\u2019s your general technical knowledge", "there are high iq people who can do amazing things on questionnaires and then if you hand them a puzzle, they kinda look at it like \u2013 or if you hand them a transmission and you say break this transmission down and put it back together", "that\u2019s just a different type of mind", "tim ferriss:\u00a0sure", "tim kennedy:\u00a0special forces, they want smart guys that are physically capable, that have a very, very high acumen in general technical ability", "so, there\u2019s some tests that \u2013 when you take the asvab, which is kinda the general military intelligence test, that has subcategories that \u2013 one of which is your gt score, your general technical knowledge", "so, make sure your scores are good", "you have the proficiency to learn a second language quickly or you already have a second language, which is required in all special forces", "and then you go to basic training as an infantryman", "if you finish basic training, you go to airborne school", "you finish basic training, infantry school, and airborne school, then you go to special operations preparation course", "and this is the attritor", "this is the opportunity for the special forces to get rid of you", "it\u2019s run by senior special forces ncos and they \u2013 it\u2019s their first access to the fresh population of potential candidates that are gonna go to selection", "if you don\u2019t pass sopc, then you don\u2019t get to go to selection", "if you don\u2019t go to selection, then you go to the needs of the army", "you can go back to being infantry, or you could go to eod, or you could do anything else", "you just can\u2019t be a green beret", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what does eod stand for", "or what is it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it\u2019s getting rid of bombs; explosive ordnance disposal", "tim ferriss:\u00a0okay, i got it", "i got it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0guys would go to psychological operations, civil affairs, just kinda any other high speed, cool job, but you\u2019re just never gonna be special forces", "i think we had \u2013 we got there in april and they froze guys going to selection in may, june, july, and august because it was too hot and a bunch of green berets keep dying in selection", "well, pre-green berets", "so, they wouldn\u2019t let us go", "so, they had us for four or five months, of all of these recruits coming in", "and the 500 of us, they sent 91 of us to selection", "everybody else went away", "tim ferriss:\u00a0washed out a lot of people", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "and of the 91 of us, 88 of us got selected and then went to \u2013 when you get selected, that just means you get to go to the q course, which is somewhere between a year to two years of training to show up on the team, and then realize that you know nothing, and that you\u2019re a piece of shit, and that you have everything to learn the day that you walk through the door", "tim ferriss:\u00a0when you got into the q course, what were you best at and what were you worst at", "where did you excel and where were you deficient the most, if you remember", "tim kennedy:\u00a0they loved the gray guy", "they always said be the gray man", "be the man \u2013 be the guy \u2013 you know, there are 200 people in formation, be the guy that nobody knows the name of", "which means if you\u2019re gonna run a pt test, there\u2019s the guy that goes the fastest and there\u2019s the guy that goes the slowest", "you wanna be the guy that just passes that nobody knows about", "tim ferriss:\u00a0why is that", "tim kennedy:\u00a0being so unremarkable is, especially in special operations, a trait that\u2019s really hard to find", "tim ferriss:\u00a0is that for blending in later, for being inconspicuous later", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, and also, we don\u2019t want show boaters", "you can go to the navy seals", "and we don\u2019t want failures", "you can go to the air force", "so, we want that sweet middle ground", "we want the gray man that can do anything, that will always pass, and you forget about the moment you take your eyes off him", "i\u2019m looking right at you, but where\u2019d you go, man", "i know you were right there", "you cross the finish line and you\u2019re like, alright, great job", "what was that dude\u2019s name again", "that\u2019s the guy that we want because that guy\u2019s priceless", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, were you that guy", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i was not that guy", "i was the guy that would finish first", "i was the guy that was \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0biceps the size of my chest probably", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, and competitive shooter, a professional fighter", "they knew who i was", "so, it took a lot of practice, and training, and pain to kinda get the gray man mentality", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i wanted to be \u2013 i wanted everybody to be like, oh, look at tim", "great", "look at that guy", "be like tim", "that\u2019s just not how it is in that culture", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, how do they beat that out of you", "or how do they \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0they beat that \u2013 you said it", "they beat it out of you", "so, if you\u2019re in sere school, you\u2019re talking about being a gray man", "if you\u2019re the tallest \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0what is that", "that\u2019s \u2013 help me out", "what does \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0survival, evasion, resistance, escape", "it\u2019s a month-long torture school where you wanna be the gray man", "if you\u2019re not the gray man, you\u2019re being beaten; phone books, hoses, starvation, cold water, locked inside of cages, locked inside of boxes that you can\u2019t take a full breath in, locked inside of a box that you can\u2019t stand up in, that you can\u2019t stretch in, being pissed on getting put in a pond that\u2019s frozen, and making you squat so your tiny little dick and the balls which are essentially up inside of your stomach are barely touching, and breaking the ice, and you have to stand there in a half-squat with the water just playing with what\u2019s left of your tiny penis with somebody making fun of you while you\u2019re doing it", "you\u2019re like, oh, look at his little dick", "and why are you taller than i am tall", "oh, and then they beat you again", "so, they beat it out of you", "you\u2019ll get good at it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m trying to think of how to segue here", "tim kennedy:\u00a0mental toughness \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0now, when \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 it can be taught", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 is it considered graduating from, say, ranger school", "what is that moment", "where does that come after that particular \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0so, there\u2019s a bunch of phases in the q course", "once you get selected and you start the q course, you have small unit tactics", "so, it\u2019s learning how to be a guerilla war fighter", "and then from there you have to learn your job", "so, you\u2019re in 18 bravo, i\u2019m in 18 bravo, special forces weapons sergeant", "i have to learn everything about every single foreign weapon", "it\u2019s how to assemble and disassemble a dshk, and then an american m2, and then an ak-47, an m4, an m21, an m14", "i need to know all these weapons, how to assemble, how to disassemble", "if you put all the parts into a box, i can pick all the parts out and figure out which gun is which, and then put them together", "i can close my eyes", "i can do it with every single american gun, so that if you send me to a country and all we have access to is local indigenous guns, it\u2019s cool", "we\u2019re good with these", "and i know how to work it, and how to clean it, and how to operate it", "so, that\u2019s my job", "the security of my team, also an 18 bravo skill set", "and then from there, you would \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0what does security mean in this context", "tim kennedy:\u00a0right now in this room that we\u2019re in, where would i set up early warning", "am i gonna bribe the bum that\u2019s on the street corner that\u2019s watching the front door", "or the guy that\u2019s at the front desk that let me in here and pushed the elevator button", "is he gonna have my direct cell phone line", "but if i go to the dominican republic to do a counter human trafficking mission, who am i bribing", "how am i protecting my team", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i got it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0or if i\u2019m in country, or if i\u2019m in afghanistan, or if i\u2019m in iraq, what is the outside cordon", "if i\u2019m gonna level all the bushes, and then i\u2019m gonna put up a high fence, and then i\u2019m gonna have mines in between the high fence and the mid fence", "and then from the mid fence to my security positions where i have machine guns positioned with air locked in sectors of fire", "so, by the time you get to my little hut in the middle, it\u2019s been a pretty bad fight", "i\u2019m supposed to be able to think of all that", "i\u2019m a security consultant, but for 12 special forces guys when everybody around us wants to kill us", "so, you\u2019ve done sut, small unit tactics, guerilla warfare, you\u2019ve learned your job", "then you go and you apply it in a phase called robin sage, which is the coolest phase there is", "tim ferriss:\u00a0robin sage", "tim kennedy:\u00a0robin sage", "you go to a country called pineland and you are embedded with 11 other special forces guys", "tim ferriss:\u00a0now, is that a nickname for a real country or is it a simulation", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it\u2019s a simulation and it\u2019s a very vietnam-era simulation or north iraq pre-war with the kurds about to fight saddam", "they put you in and they have 100 role players that are your indigenous fighting force, your militia", "and you\u2019re trying to train them; you\u2019re trying to prepare them", "you set up a base of operations that they\u2019re gonna be fighting out of and you start running military operations to overthrow a government, to battle a local other insurgency, a competitive warlord, so that we have the hope of implementing democracy", "and then help them write a constitution", "and then help them put people into government that can run the country appropriately", "and there are very intentional design problems that come up in this phase", "but it\u2019s a full \u2013 you pack your rucksack with your food and your water, and you jump out of an airplane into the middle of a forest", "and you link up with the local gs and you start conducting this month, two month long exercise", "you finish that, you go to sere school", "you graduate sere school; you finally get to go to being awarded your green beret", "and then you step into an oda and they\u2019re like, you suck", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what\u2019s an oda", "tim kennedy:\u00a0special forces operation detachment alpha", "it\u2019s the a-team", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i got it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0where the oda is the a-team", "and they say go sit in a corner and open your eyes, open your ears, and shut your mouth", "and you do that for a year", "then you get to start work", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, you get to start work", "at what point \u2013 so i was doing some reading and, again, correct me if i\u2019m wrong here, the guy who once you graduated ranger school, a place that starves you and denies you sleep for over two months, took a fight six days later in the ifl", "why would you do such a thing", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i\u2019m stupid", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i get it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i think we have a recurring theme here, right", "god, you\u2019re just a dumb person", "you\u2019re a smart person, tim", "and then across the table, there\u2019s this other person that\u2019s super stupid", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i mean, it seems to have worked for you so far", "tim kennedy:\u00a0hurry up and fail, right", "i graduated from ranger school as an honor grad, which is \u2013 of the 400-500 people that went, the 200-300 that graduated, there are three that are selected; one for the ncos, one for the officers, and one as an overall, as the best rangers of that class", "so, i graduate", "i actually fought in the army combatives tournament, which is one of the, i think, most grueling unknown tournaments in the world", "i fought that the friday, saturday, sunday \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0what is it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it is a three-day tournament", "you win on thursday", "friday, it\u2019s all grappling", "tim ferriss:\u00a0who are the contestants or the combatants", "where are they from", "tim kennedy:\u00a0combat arms of all branches of service", "so, navy seals, green berets, army rangers, 101st airborne, 82nd airborne, infantrymen; anybody that kicks ass for a living can come and fight in the combatives tournament", "tim ferriss:\u00a0the unknown kumite of the military", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "so, first day is all grappling", "it\u2019s like a grappling tourney", "if you win that day, you go to the next day, which is \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0are the rules sports jiu-jitso", "are they different", "tim kennedy:\u00a0similar to sports jiu-jitso", "there\u2019s no pulling guard, you can slam, you can knock out people \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0with a slam or a throw", "tim kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 with a slam or a throw, so very combat-focused grappling", "you win that, you move to the next day, which is pancrase rules, which is limited striking", "you can kick to the head, open palm to the head, closed fist to the body, knees to the body, and then grappling", "all submissions are in", "if you win that day, then you move into the third day, which is full mma rules, and it\u2019s like a ufc fight, but you\u2019re in your uniform", "so, you\u2019re still fighting in \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, right, in your gear", "tim kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 in your gear the whole time", "tim ferriss:\u00a0are there any rule differences between the mma rules, per say, in this tournament and regular mma rules", "tim kennedy:\u00a0no, they\u2019re pretty similar to ufc rules", "tim ferriss:\u00a0got it, more so than a pride", "so, you\u2019re not allowed to kick on the ground", "tim kennedy:\u00a0no", "so, that was the day i went to ranger school", "i weighed in on thursday", "i fought friday, saturday, sunday; won my third army combatives tournament, and the only person to ever win it three times", "and then sunday night, i checked into ranger school", "i went to ranger school, graduated honor grad \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0how much later was that", "tim kennedy:\u00a0the same day", "tim ferriss:\u00a0oh, i got it, okay", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, finished sunday from the combatives tournament, iced my hands, and then checked into ranger school that same day, and started ranger school that sunday night", "two-and-a-half months later, i graduate from ranger school, honor grad, and then eight days later, i\u2019m fighting dante rivera in the ufc \u2013 or in the ifl", "tim ferriss:\u00a0now, did you \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0[inaudible] [00:42:17] that\u2019s really dumb", "tim ferriss:\u00a0but did you go into that particular fight, did you commit to that fight because you wanted to win, because you wanted to see if it was possible to do such a thing after the experience of ranger school", "did you just commit so long ago that you were like, oh, shit, here it is", "i mean, aside from you saying it\u2019s stupid, but i know you\u2019re not a stupid", "i mean, so what was the thought process", "what were you hoping to get out of that", "tim kennedy:\u00a0right now, if somebody kicked in the front door of this room and ten mexican cartel guys run in, sicarios with their masks pulled over, what do you think i would do", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do i think you would do", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i think you\u2019d probably go straight for it", "tim kennedy:\u00a0for sure, right", "i\u2019m tearing out eyes, i\u2019m biting out cheeks, i\u2019m taking this glass right here and it\u2019s going through the first dude\u2019s eye", "i\u2019m gonna take that stand right there and i\u2019m gonna use it as a baseball bat", "i\u2019m gonna make it a choke point right there by the hallway, where it\u2019s like we\u2019re in thermopylae and see if you guys can get past us, like the 300", "that\u2019s just the spirit of the fight", "and i think you have to test the spirit of the fight", "when i graduated from ranger school, i got the call a couple of days later, could you fight in the ifl, which was a new promotion that was on fox", "i knew i was gonna already be heading to combat", "and the reason i had to go to ranger school was i had just gotten back from iraq and my boss, john mcphee, the sheriff of baghdad, he told me i was a piece of shit", "and he said that i had no business being in a unit like the one that we were in because we were in a very special unit within special forces", "and that i didn\u2019t have the leadership, and i didn\u2019t have the experience, and i didn\u2019t have the military bearing to be in that unit, and that i could maybe get a chance if i went to ranger school and i graduated honor grad", "i knew i was gonna be heading back to combat, so i not only needed to prove to him that i was a good leader, but i was also tough enough that i deserved to be there", "tim ferriss:\u00a0just if i can hit pause for a second, why did he say that", "i mean, with the degree with which you\u2019re comfortable disclosing, what happened that would lead him to say that", "tim kennedy:\u00a0there are a lot of little things", "we\u2019re on a night where we\u2019re trying to kill one of the most evil dudes in all of the war; we\u2019re in a war for 16 years, al-zarqawi", "remember the deck of cards", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i do, yeah", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, he was an ace", "he\u2019s a bad dude", "he had strung up americans from bridges and set them on fire", "he drug dudes down the road, strapped behind a car that he\u2019d stolen from the americans", "he was notorious for posing with pictures with dead americans in front of him, holding their guns like he was an african trophy hunter", "even the movie american sniper with chris kyle; chris kyle was going after his henchmen, lower level guys", "my unit was going after him", "tim ferriss:\u00a0zarqawi", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, going specifically after zarqawi", "and there were nights where we\u2019re supposed to have eight helicopters", "so, the whole assault force is gonna be going, right", "and then error, or the mechanic, or something came up and we only had six", "so, my team sergeant\u2019s like, alright, here\u2019s the new load plan", "tim, you\u2019re not gonna go", "little check on my ego; that sucks, why can\u2019t \u2013 i\u2019m faster, i\u2019m stronger, i\u2019m definitely the juggernaut of the team", "i\u2019m outshooting you guys on the range right now", "i\u2019m outfighting you guys every morning in training", "why am i not going", "like a little petulant child; like a spoiled bitch brat; red-headed idiot", "retrospectively looking, that\u2019s what i sounded like", "like, no, john, why can\u2019t i go", "so, i get \u2013 there were lots of little, tiny things that i did there; that he was giving me a chance to prove, okay, got it", "when you guys get back, i\u2019m gonna have all your gear clean, everything\u2019s gonna be ready to go, so you can drop your gear off and go straight to bed and get some sleep after a long night of gun fighting", "but instead i\u2019m bitching that i don\u2019t get to go; a bunch of examples like that", "and i could probably tell you ten", "or the spirit of me; i just wanna be in the fight, but it\u2019s a team, right", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right", "tim kennedy:\u00a0we\u2019re only as good as our weakest link and i\u2019m being the weakest link", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how much of the \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0and we\u2019re getting exposed here", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, no, no", "i mean, i\u2019m fascinated by all this", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i told you i\u2019d tell you whatever", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, i\u2019ve been \u2013 tim kennedy:\u00a0and then you\u2019re gonna hold it against and everybody\u2019s gonna be like, pffft, you\u2019re gonna be friends with that guy", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m not gonna hold it against you", "looking back then, how much of those instances \u2013 so you\u2019re not part of the load plan", "do you think it was because you weren\u2019t qualified to be part of the load versus i wanna see how tim responds", "tim kennedy:\u00a0both, i\u2019m sure it was both", "i mean, there were times where i know he specifically put me on a load plan that i didn\u2019t need to be on just to see how i\u2019d perform", "and the very next day wouldn\u2019t put me \u2013 okay, i\u2019m not gonna put you on the helicopter assault force, the haf, i\u2019m gonna put you on the gaf, the ground assault force", "and i was like, i don\u2019t wanna be on the ground", "so, how about you shut your face, you go out to that m2 50 cal", "machine gun, you start doing the head space and timing, making sure it\u2019s clean, making sure all the ammo\u2019s stacked perfectly so when you\u2019re on it and if you get in a gun fight, everything\u2019s gonna go so perfectly for you, but instead you\u2019re bitching", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right, right", "tim kennedy:\u00a0and i know he did that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, then he gives you the kinda verbal report card that you described, and you have this ifl coming up, and you feel like you need to show what", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i think i wanted to show myself that spirit of the fight", "so, i come back", "i not only graduated as honor grad, i also get the leadership award, which is the thing i wanted the most", "so, all of ranger school is like, okay, you\u2019re the best leader of this whole entire class", "but i get back to the team \u2013 i\u2019ve got a little bit more military bearing, i got my ranger tab on here sewn with white thread because i graduated during winter and we walked through snow, which only rarely happens", "so, i\u2019m feeling pretty awesome, but i haven\u2019t lost my fight", "i kinda wanted to show him that i\u2019m still that same bulldog", "i\u2019m still that same pit bull", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i still have the things you liked", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, like that", "i haven\u2019t changed as a person and i\u2019m gonna \u2013 who\u2019s this dante rivera", "a renzo gracie brown or black belt that is undefeated", "neat, i\u2019m gonna pound him into oblivion", "and i\u2019ll come back to the team on monday and start getting ready to go to afghanistan", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright", "so, you\u2019ve been starved, denied sleep for two months", "you take this fight", "you go into the fight", "what happens", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i pound him into oblivion", "he quit \u2013 he tapped from strikes", "i put him in every single position and for a round and a half, i just punched him in the face; from our feet, from the ground, picked him up, put him on the back of his head", "when guys graduate ranger school, a lot of guys don\u2019t walk for months", "their legs are so destroyed", "they\u2019re so malnourished", "they\u2019re so sleep deprived", "the inside of their legs are so chafed and rubbed raw", "they\u2019ll actually get \u2013 in the military, you get a medical release where you don\u2019t have to show up for pt test or any physical activity, physical training in the morning because they know you\u2019re so jacked up", "and they\u2019ll give you that for months after ranger school", "so, i wanted to go into a fight a week and a half after graduating ranger school and scare the living crap out of everyone", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you did", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0a couple of questions that i think are tangentially related, but i was actually very curious to talk about a few things", "briefly, walkout music; what have you used and why", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i used to walk out to the most fun, most disarming song i possibly could; like, \u201cdo you really want to hurt me, do you really want to make me cry?\u201d and i\u2019d sing it to them as i was walking out", "i was pointing at them", "and i\u2019d get in the ring, i\u2019m still pointing at them, maybe batting my eyes, maybe blowing them kisses, just to mess with them", "and i\u2019d do a bunch of different songs like that all the time", "and then my friend, nick palmisciano from ranger up, he\u2019s like, hey, man, do you know the origin of the song rooster", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alice in chains", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "and i was like, yeah, right", "it\u2019s a rooster \u2013 he\u2019s like, it\u2019s about a machine gunner in vietnam", "he\u2019s writing to his dad who was in vietnam and would carry the m16 machine gun for the 101st", "i was like, no", "are you serious", "the forgotten war with the forgotten soldiers; the time when the american people were so disenchanted with what the military was doing, fighting for freedom, trying to destroy communism", "and i was like, okay", "i\u2019m gonna walk out to this every day", "so, the last half of my career, i would always walk out to that song, rooster", "and as a homage or a tribute to not just vietnam, not just pows, not just machine gunners, not just infantrymen, but for everybody everywhere that\u2019s ever fought in a fight for something that\u2019s bigger and greater than them with no thanks, no appreciation", "because i wasn\u2019t there fighting for me, i was there fighting for everybody else besides me at that point", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and we were chatting a little bit before hitting record today and i asked you what would make this a successful interview looking back a few months from now", "and i might get the exact words wrong, but you said it would be nice if people would stop dying", "you talked about helping people become harder to kill", "so, how do people listening \u2013 how do you suggest to people listening who may be \u2013 let\u2019s assume they\u2019re in not couch-potato shape, 150 pounds overweight, but that they\u2019re non-athletes who are in reasonable shape, but have no military experience, haven\u2019t been exposed to any, maybe, real what they would consider physical hardship in a long time, how does someone like that, if they think to themselves i would like to become harder to kill, what would your program or recommendations look like for them", "tim kennedy:\u00a0one of the hardest things about me trying to inspire and encourage people to train is they look at me and they\u2019re like, that guy\u2019s freaking savage", "he\u2019s a special forces sniper, ranger-qualified green beret that\u2019s been to combat 12 times, fought in the ufc, ranked top ten in the world", "he\u2019s a black belt in a handful of martial arts", "but i\u2019m the exact same person as the other seven billion people on the planet, right", "i didn\u2019t grow up with any kryptonite in the fridge", "there\u2019s nothing that is different about me in any way, shape, or form", "i just work", "and i\u2019m just fighting \u2013 at this point i\u2019m fighting for not even 1 percent to get 1 percent better", "i\u2019m fighting for percentages of a percent; incrementally decimals, the tiniest little bits, just for that much of an improvement", "i long for the day where i would get dramatically faster in a month", "that if i was 20 percent body fat, i could be 18 percent body fat; do you know how freaking cool that would be", "right now, if i could just lose 2 percent fat", "tim ferriss:\u00a0meaning you\u2019re envious of the people who have more as a percentage to gain if they started doing things in terms of training and so on", "tim kennedy:\u00a0but you just said it; if they just started doing things", "that\u2019s it", "all you have to do is start", "so, to everybody, where do i start", "man, anything", "you could get up \u2013 if you don\u2019t walk around \u2013 if you haven\u2019t gotten up and walked around your block a couple of times, do that", "if you haven\u2019t googled where the closest martial art gym is, whether it\u2019s judo, whether it\u2019s jiu-jitso, whether it\u2019s muay thai, whether it\u2019s wrestling", "it doesn\u2019t matter", "if you haven\u2019t done it, try it", "if you\u2019ve never gone to a shooting range and shot, give it a whirl", "if you\u2019ve been eating fried food for three meals, three dinners, out of the week, try two", "just anything will make you just that much better", "and then those little, tiny decisions start building on top of each other and then, sooner or later, you look back and you don\u2019t even recognize the person that you are", "there\u2019s just this beautiful change where like, oh my god, i can see my dick, i can see my feet, or my wife for the first time in five years", "i saw her look at me when i got up and i walked out of the room", "and not looked at me like, thank god that guy\u2019s getting up and leaving", "but like, goddamn, that guy looked good", "when was the last time in some people\u2019s lives that they felt that way about the person they\u2019d been living with for ten years", "make that girl fall in love with you again", "impress the fuck out of her", "when was the last time that you picked up both your kids and ran to the play gym with them hoisted on your shoulders", "and put one up on the other one", "the other one, you\u2019re holding", "you hand them on the play gym", "that\u2019s some massive masculine shit", "you\u2019re just playing with your kids on a play gym", "but there are these opportunities and there are so many of them for us just to embrace our potential", "i mean, you know more about it better than almost anyone on the planet because you\u2019ve pushed that limit so many times in so many different ways, both intellectually and physically", "there\u2019s so much unrealized potential", "back to me at 21 years old; a little piece of shit, self-absorbed, at the centric prick", "unrealized potential; there\u2019s 120-140 million americans right now that just has total unrealized potential", "just go \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0whatever that is", "tim kennedy:\u00a0\u2013 get started, just start", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, if they wanted to, for instance, develop on top of some of the physical training, the abcs, the basic literacy of survival", "let\u2019s say they live in an urban environment", "what might those be", "i mean, taking a two or three-day cpr class, emt stuff", "you mentioned active shooter defense, which i think is particularly relevant in some respects, but what would some of those abcs be", "if someone\u2019s like, you know what", "i really wanna spend, let\u2019s say, a weekend \u2013 every weekend for the next eight weeks amassing some of these skills", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i mean, i\u2019ll just say a and b", "a is keep the blood in the good guys", "and b is let the blood out of the bad guys", "that\u2019s it", "alright", "if they\u2019re innocent people, they\u2019re cops, they\u2019re firefighters, they\u2019re school children, bunch of people dancing at a nightclub, and somebody comes in, starts trying to shoot people, we wanna keep the blood inside of those people", "alright", "the blood, we only have a finite amount of it", "blood stays in the body of the good people", "and then the bad guys, you want all of the blood in them, out of them in whatever way you can", "i don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a knife", "i don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a gun", "i don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a brick", "i don\u2019t care if that\u2019s a bottle", "that person needs to stop hurting people", "so, yeah, that might be cpr", "that might be learning how to put on a tourniquet", "that might be learning how to prevent it from happening entirely, which is situational awareness", "my good friend shane and i, when we go out to eat here in austin, we almost play games; biometrics and atmospherics, where we\u2019re sitting in a restaurant and we look at everybody in the room", "well, the first thing we do is identify potential threats in our threat assessments", "and then we figure out where the guns are in the room", "who\u2019s the guy that is wearing the come-and-take-it shirt, that has the fanny pack, or that has that bulge on his right hip, or that has that appendix carrier", "it\u2019s like, dude, that guy is not dirk diggler", "he is not that big", "there\u2019s something in the front of his pants", "and then we start making assumptions about who\u2019s in the room", "the two people that are sitting together that kind of are awkwardly interacting; is this their first date, is this a business meeting, is it the first time that they\u2019ve ever been alone, or are they married and they\u2019re not supposed to be \u2013 they\u2019re not married to each other, and meeting up for the first time", "but we start making these assumptions", "and then we develop another skill set, which is i go up and i start chatting these people up", "i\u2019m like, hey, what\u2019s going on", "is that your truck out there", "man, i love those rims", "and in a disarming way, start eliciting, very passively, information out of them to confirm or \u2013 to prove us right or wrong in the assumptions that we\u2019ve made thus far", "so, it\u2019s developing two things simultaneously", "but that is the first element of being safe, is being aware of your surroundings", "knowing where i\u2019m gonna run", "knowing where the out is, where the exit is, where my car is parked, where a threat is gonna come from", "what\u2019s the most likely course of action", "what\u2019s the most dangerous course of action", "if i\u2019m at a taco place, the most dangerous course of action is somebody coming and setting a bomb off", "the most likely course of action is just somebody coming up and being like, hey, give me the money in the register", "but i need to think about what the different degrees are of what the threats possibly could be", "my kids never know that all this \u2013 maybe they have a clue", "they\u2019re smart", "but they never think about this stuff", "they just know that they\u2019re safe; that i have a way to get out", "the backpack that\u2019s right here next to me that has a gun in it, that has two tourniquets, and it has an ifak in it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what\u2019s an ifak", "tim kennedy:\u00a0an individual first aid kit", "so, even all of us right here, i have enough stuff, if all of you guys got shot, to plug your wounds", "i\u2019ve got my backpack right here and a good gun with an extra magazine", "tim ferriss:\u00a0 what type of a gun, just out of curiosity", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it\u2019s a glock 43, but i\u2019ve got good frangible rounds and a couple extra magazines", "so, we\u2019d be alright", "tim ferriss:\u00a0alright", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it\u2019s tricked out though; good sites, good trigger, good barrel, because i don\u2019t wanna fight fair, because i wanna cheat in every way", "tim ferriss:\u00a0well, it makes me think of \u2013 i think i\u2019m getting this right", "i think it\u2019s hackworth", "that makes sense, right", "that\u2019s a real name", "tim kennedy:\u00a0it sounds like a real name", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, if you find yourself in a fair fight, you didn\u2019t plan your mission properly", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "i think my favorite fight in the world would be the dude\u2019s laying on his bed asleep and \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0there it is", "tim kennedy:\u00a0right behind me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0just in case i make any odd moves", "do you find it \u2013 what is your emotional state when you\u2019re doing these types of checks", "is it playful", "is it serious", "is it stressful", "tim kennedy:\u00a0no, it\u2019s living", "it\u2019s freedom", "it\u2019s freeing", "so, i had this huge level of awareness, where it\u2019s kind of like i\u2019m radar; ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding", "and when i see something that\u2019s off \u2013 in the military, everything is uniform", "everybody wears the same thing", "everybody dresses the same", "everybody makes their bed the same", "and that\u2019s so when you look at something that is off, your eye catches it right away", "that\u2019s why everything\u2019s uniform in the military", "did you know that", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah", "tim kennedy:\u00a0so, it\u2019s easier to see when something\u2019s wrong because everything looks the same", "tim ferriss:\u00a0makes perfect sense", "yeah, right, it makes perfect sense", "tim kennedy:\u00a0so, have you ever worked counterfeiting stuff", "tim ferriss:\u00a0i\u2019m sorry", "tim kennedy:\u00a0counterfeiting", "so, if i was trying to find \u2013 the easiest way to find a counterfeit bill is to put it with a whole bunch of bills that i know are good", "so, your eye is like, well, that one looks \u2013 tim ferriss:\u00a0it\u2019s the one thing that sticks out", "tim kennedy:\u00a0that one looks weird", "the color\u2019s off or the dimensions aren\u2019t right, or the paper doesn\u2019t feel right, or compared to these other 100 bills, this one \u2013 that one\u2019s wrong", "so, it\u2019s the exact same", "what you have to do is you have to train your mind what normal is", "so, in austin, where it\u2019s south by \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve got a little bit more traffic", "we were talking about it", "that is a very casual way of being situationally aware", "that\u2019s setting up the sample of what is normal", "so, then when something is off, when something\u2019s weird, when something\u2019s just a little bit awry, my eye goes from awareness to assessing", "i start looking specifically at that thing; that guy that\u2019s wearing the white muslin prayer robes that\u2019s swearing", "everybody else, they\u2019re holding beers", "they\u2019re like, hey, here, let\u2019s do a selfie", "okay, let\u2019s hashtag south by southwest", "you\u2019re like, that\u2019s normal", "even though, unfortunately, that\u2019s normal", "that one thing looks off", "we can see that very clearly because we know what normal is for what\u2019s happening around us", "so, the first thing is kinda be learning about cultures, learning about the areas that you\u2019re living, the demographics, the socio-economic classes, the races that should be there", "i do that to everywhere i go", "i just came from ocala, florida", "that was the last place that i was in", "and i know that percentages of races, who should be there with what kinds of cars people should drive", "that it\u2019s 73 percent white, and of the remaining 27 percent, half of them are mexican", "and then the other remaining 13, 12 percent are split between black and asian", "tim ferriss:\u00a0where do you get that information", "is that the state department stuff", "wikipedia", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, it\u2019s on the census", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, yeah", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i mean, that\u2019s all available online", "and it\u2019s one little search", "and that\u2019s just a couple of quick, little numbers so that you can kinda wrap your head around it", "but if i go to walmart, i\u2019m gonna have a different crowd than if i go to target; two different people shop there; different socio-economic classes", "different types of cars are supposed to be parked there", "but in the parking lot, where am i gonna find the drugs", "where am i gonna find the guy that has the guns", "the guy that\u2019s parked in the back trying to get a blowjob; the guy that\u2019s parked around the side of the building where there are no lights and maybe a camera that\u2019s busted because he\u2019s about to do a drug deal", "so, just knowing how people work; okay, i\u2019m not gonna park there", "then i\u2019m gonna park here", "it\u2019s really simple stuff", "so, then when i say it\u2019s freeing, all that stuff happens so effortless now that now it\u2019s just \u2013 i\u2019m just at lunch with my buddy shane and we\u2019re just talking shit about people tim ferriss:\u00a0right, right, right", "and it just happens", "tim kennedy:\u00a0and it just happens", "tim ferriss:\u00a0why did you re-enlist in the special forces", "the date i have is april 16th 2017", "why did you re-enlist", "tim kennedy:\u00a0man, i don\u2019t like losing fights", "tim ferriss:\u00a0yeah, i imagine", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah, i\u2019ve lost a few", "tim ferriss:\u00a0some close ones too", "tim kennedy:\u00a0they\u2019re like a thorn, like a burr in the back of my neck", "it\u2019s always just irritating", "i hope to the day i die that they irritate me", "and we\u2019re losing a war", "i fought in places like ramadi, and sadr city in baghdad, and fallujah, and those were cities that good friends of mine got hurt in", "and i was fighting next to iraqis that wanted freedom so badly", "they wanted to have a chance at just living", "muslims, christians, didn\u2019t matter; just give us a chance", "and all of us are fighting together for that chance", "and then all those cities that we fought and that we won, isis comes in because of policies, because of presidents, because of secretary of defenses, and bad decisions, bad war planning, and we lose ground", "and i can\u2019t explain to you how bad that hurts guys like me to see things that they fought for, and they bled for, and they got blown up in just given back to an enemy that\u2019s even more evil than the evil that we won it from", "i\u2019ll take ten saddams over an isis", "and i see mad dog mattis is coming back as secretary of defense", "and i see not just him, but other people being put into positions of authority within my chain of command that believe in a winning", "and i like winning", "as much as i don\u2019t like losing, i really like winning", "and this is gonna be chance for us to be winning again", "in a year, what was the ground that isis has had, they\u2019ve lost 99 percent of it in one year", "that\u2019s winning", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do you attribute that to", "tim kennedy:\u00a0to kicking ass", "i mean, it\u2019s plain and simple", "if you take a bunch of pit bulls, and you put them in cages, and then you let chihuahuas out, they\u2019re never gonna go \u2013 and you\u2019re supposed to be catching wild boars, that chihuahua is never gonna do anything, right", "it\u2019s gonna bark and then it\u2019s gonna run back", "but if you open those cages, there\u2019s only one thing those pit bulls know how to do, is just kick ass", "and that\u2019s all that happened", "we\u2019re just like, okay, we\u2019re gonna go i saw that you killed some of our green berets in southeast afghanistan", "cool", "we\u2019re gonna drop the biggest bomb that\u2019s not nuclear that we have in our arsenal on top of you, which is what we did", "it\u2019s like, oh, you killed some green berets in niger", "neat", "we\u2019re gonna fly in 800 shooters and wipe all of boko haram, al-qaeda, and isis off of the map entirely in your country", "it\u2019s like, oh, you had fallujah, sadr city, ramadi; not only are we gonna take them back, but we\u2019re gonna take them back and we\u2019re gonna put conservative muslim leaders in there that are so far from fanatic radicals that girls get to go back to school", "i mean, do things that would just irritate radicals so bad", "they have freedom again", "and so what i attribute it to is giving the guys that know what they\u2019re supposed to do the opportunity to do it", "that\u2019s it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how old are your \u2013 you have two kids", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i have three", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you have three", "and how old are your kids", "tim kennedy:\u00a016, 15, and 2", "tim ferriss:\u00a0what do you say to them if \u2013 i don\u2019t know if you\u2019re \u2013 i don\u2019t know the nature of the re-enlistment and your activities, but if you\u2019re going to be at risk, how do you explain the decision and so on to them", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i\u2019m at risk", "i\u2019m deploying two times in the next year; one time really, really, really soon", "and i\u2019m glad we got to sit down and chat because i\u2019m gonna be gone for the next year", "they know that this is what i was made to do and they love it when i get to do it", "they\u2019re proud of me in the sense that if they walk onto a military base with me, everybody is walking up to shake my hand", "it\u2019s different than being in austin where people wanna come up and take selfies", "they wanna come up and shake my hand because they know what i\u2019ve done and they know what i\u2019m gonna do", "and that makes them proud; a 15 and 16-year-old girl, that\u2019s awesome", "a 2-year-old is just like, i have poop in my pants", "tim ferriss:\u00a0right, a different conversation", "tim kennedy:\u00a0but is he gonna understand dad being gone for six months", "no, he\u2019s gonna be pissed", "and he\u2019s gonna take it out on my wife", "my girls are gonna \u2013 they\u2019re gonna be pissed, but they also know that i would rather be fighting that there than in front of their school", "i\u2019ve tracked down guys that were riding down the street on motorcycles throwing acid on little girls that were walking to school because they didn\u2019t think girls should go to school", "i want that to happen nowhere on the planet and in the places that it does, i wanna go there and stop it from happening", "i don\u2019t want that to be here", "that\u2019s on a rise in the uk right now", "it\u2019s increased by almost 1,000 percent as people are trying to prevent girls from going to school, specifically with acid", "okay, send me to the uk", "i can fix this", "you\u2019re not gonna like how i\u2019m gonna do it, but i can fix it", "tim ferriss:\u00a0how do you think about risk", "and maybe that\u2019s not the right word, but you get deployed, ostensibly something bad could happen to you", "how do you think about that yourself", "tim kennedy:\u00a0 when we\u2019re stripped down \u2013 you go all the way back to the most raw, exposed version of that special forces soldier and they start building those cornerstones in the foundation, we\u2019re risk adverse", "we\u2019re trying to set ourselves up for success in every imaginable way so that we can\u2019t fail", "if and when things start failing, there\u2019s so much training, and there\u2019s so much rehearsal, and there\u2019s so much practice, and there\u2019s so much strategy, and there\u2019s so much preparation that that quote of i\u2019m gonna be the hardest person somebody ever tries to kill \u2013 imagine fighting 12 of me, or 24 of me, or 36 of me", "tim ferriss:\u00a0no thanks", "tim kennedy:\u00a0with an ac-130 flying over us, and an f-16, and a couple apaches on standby, you\u2019re not gonna deal with one of me, you\u2019re gonna deal with me and all of my friends that have been born and bred to do this one thing, which is give people a chance to fight for their freedom", "you don\u2019t wanna fuck with us", "we really like that freedom thing", "tim ferriss:\u00a0do you have a contingency plan if something happens to you", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0you do", "tim kennedy:\u00a0yeah", "my family will be very well off, probably better financially", "all the guys that we\u2019re with, they know \u2013 these are horrible conversations to have and things that i don\u2019t want my family to know, but if i break my back or if i\u2019m so badly burned, to what degree are they gonna try to save me", "that\u2019s a conversation we have", "maybe don\u2019t put me on that bird; maybe just let me die right here", "but that\u2019s a conversation for me and my friends", "i\u2019ve had dudes be like, alright, listen", "all i want you to do is take my cell phone, smash it on the ground, go take my laptop, smash that on the ground, and then make sure my body goes to my wife", "which is funny, but these are conversations that we have", "and everybody\u2019s is different", "but as a team, sure as shit, i\u2019m gonna make sure that dude\u2019s \u2013 i\u2019m not only gonna smash his laptop, i\u2019m probably gonna microwave it and then i\u2019m gonna throw it in the ocean, or the river, or tigris", "yes, we have contingencies", "tim ferriss:\u00a0if you could put one word, question, short message, anything on a billboard just to get it out to millions or billions of people, metaphorically speaking, what might you put on such a billboard", "tim kennedy:\u00a0one word", "tim ferriss:\u00a0no, no", "it could be one word, it could be a sentence, it could be a question, could be anything, could be a long quote that you like", "it could be anything", "tim kennedy:\u00a0i just want people to work", "we\u2019re in a society of \u2013 a culture of entitlement where it\u2019s like everybody wants the fast, easy, quick fix for everything", "like, oh, i\u2019m sick", "give me a prescription", "i\u2019m fat", "give me that quick, easy diet", "i\u2019m not successful at work", "just give me that promotion even though i don\u2019t deserve", "everything is just on the far side of hard work", "so, that\u2019s what i\u2019d put", "everything you want is on the far side of work", "freedom; the only place freedom exists is on the far side of hard work", "the only place success exists, financially, sexually, in relationships emotionally; it\u2019s on the far side of work", "if you want a good marriage, fucking work for it", "you want to have amazing sex", "cool, work for it", "unless you\u2019re this fictional character in \u2013 i don\u2019t even know the movies", "like dirk diggler, right", "was that based on a real guy", "was he even good at sex", "i don\u2019t know, but i\u2019ll tell you what", "somebody that really wants and is committed to being good at it is gonna be good at it", "and that goes for everything; success, sleep, even sleep", "you want good sleep", "earn it", "go work for it", "put your ipad away", "go eat a good, healthy
