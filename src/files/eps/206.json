Enjoy!\n \u2014-\u201cWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Mark Twain Reality is largely negotiable. If you stress-test the boundaries and experiment with the \u201cimpossibles,\u201d you\u2019ll quickly discover that most limitations are a fragile collection of socially reinforced rules you can choose to break at any time. What follows are 17 questions that have dramatically changed my life. Each one is time-stamped, as they entered the picture at precise moments. In 2000, I was selling mass data storage to CEOs and CTOs in my first job out of college. When I wasn\u2019t driving my mom\u2019s hand-me-down minivan to and from the office in San Jose, California, I was cold calling and cold emailing. \u201cSmiling and dialing\u201d was brutal. For the first few months, I flailed and failed (it didn\u2019t help that my desk was wedged in a fire exit). Then, one day, I realized something: All of the sales guys made their sales calls between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Obvious, right? But that\u2019s part one. Part two: I realized that all of the gatekeepers who kept me from the decision makers\u2014CEOs and CTOs\u2014also worked from 9 to 5. What if I did the opposite of all the other sales guys, just for 48 hours?\u00a0I decided to take a Thursday and Friday and make sales calls only from 7 to 8:30 a.m. and 6 to 7:30 p.m. For the rest of the day, I focused on cold emails. It worked like gangbusters. The big boss often picked up the phone directly, and I began doing more experiments with \u201cWhat if I did the opposite?\u201d: What if I only asked questions instead of pitching? What if I studied technical material, so I sounded like an engineer instead of a sales guy? What if I ended my emails with \u201cI totally understand if you\u2019re too busy to reply, and thank you for reading this far,\u201d instead of the usual \u201cI look forward to your reply and speaking soon\u201d presumptive BS? The experiments paid off. My last quarter in that job, I outsold the entire L.A. office of our biggest competitor, EMC. In late 2000 and early 2001, I saw the writing on the wall: The startup I worked for was going to implode. Rounds of layoffs started and weren\u2019t going to end. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, but I\u2019d been bitten by the startup bug and intoxicated by Silicon Valley. To explore business opportunities, I didn\u2019t do in-depth market research. I started with my credit card statement and asked myself, \u201cWhat do I spend a silly amount of money on?\u201d Where did I spend a disproportionate amount of my income? Where was I price insensitive? The answer was sports supplements. At the time, I was making less than $40K a year and spending $500 or more per month on supplements. It was insane, but dozens of my male friends were equally overboard. I already knew which ads got me to buy, which stores and websites I used to purchase goods, which bulletin boards I frequented, and all the rest. Could I create a product that would scratch my own itch? What was I currently cobbling together (I had enough science background to be dangerous) that I couldn\u2019t conveniently find at retail? The result was a cognitive enhancer called BrainQUICKEN. Before everyone got fired, I begged my coworkers to each prepay for a bottle, which gave me enough money to hire chemists, a regulatory consultant, and do a tiny manufacturing run. I was off to the races. In 2004, I was doing better than ever financially, and BrainQUICKEN was distributed in perhaps a dozen countries. The problem? I was running on caffeine, working 15-hour days, and constantly on the verge of meltdown. My girlfriend, who I expected to marry, left me due to the workaholism. Over the next 6 months of treading water and feeling trapped, I realized I had to restructure the business or shut it down\u2014it was literally killing me. This is when I began journaling on a few questions, including \u201cWhat would I want to do, have, and be if I had $10 million in the bank?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s my real target monthly income (TMI)?\u201d For the latter, in other words: How much does my dream life\u2014the stuff I\u2019m deferring for \u201cretirement\u201d\u2014really cost if I pay on a monthly basis? (See fourhourworkweek.com/tmi) After running the numbers, most of my fantasies were far more affordable than I\u2019d expected. Perhaps I didn\u2019t need to keep grinding and building? Perhaps I needed more time and mobility, not more income? This made me think that maybe, just maybe, I could afford to be happy and not just \u201csuccessful.\u201d I decided to take a long overseas trip. These questions, also from 2004, are perhaps the most important of all, so they get their own chapter. (See \u201cfear-setting\u201d on page 463 in\u00a0Tools of Titans.) After removing anxieties about the trip with fear-setting, the next practical step was removing myself as the bottleneck in my business. Alas, \u201chow can I not be a bottleneck in my own business?\u201d isn\u2019t a good question. After reading The E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber and The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch, I decided that extreme questions were the forcing function I needed. The question I found most helpful was, \u201cIf I could only work 2 hours per week on my business, what would I do?\u201d Honestly speaking, it was more like, \u201cYes, I know it\u2019s impossible, but if you had a gun to your head or contracted some horrible disease, and you had to limit work to 2 hours per week, what would you do to keep things afloat?\u201d The 80/20 principle, also known as Pareto\u2019s law, is the primary tool in this case. It dictates that 80% (or more) of your desired outcomes are the result of 20% (or less) of your activities and inputs. Here are two related questions I personally used: \u201cWhat 20% of customers/products/regions are producing 80% of the profit? What factors or shared characteristics might account for this?\u201d Many such questions later, I began making changes: \u201cfiring\u201d my highest-maintenance customers; putting more than 90% of my retail customers on autopilot with simple terms and standardized order processes; and deepening relationships (and increasing order sizes) with my 3 to 5 highest-profit, lowest-headache customers. That all led to . . . This question allowed me to take my customer service workload from 40 to 60 hours per week to less than 2 hours per week. Until mid-2004, I was the sole decision maker. For instance, if a professional athlete overseas needed our product overnighted with special customs forms, I would get an email or phone call from one of my fulfillment centers: \u201cHow should we handle this? What would you like to charge?\u201d These unusual \u201cedge cases\u201d might seem like rare exceptions, but they were a daily occurrence. Dozens per week hit me, on top of everything else. The fix: I sent an email to all of my direct reports along the lines of \u201cFrom this point forward, please don\u2019t contact for me with questions about A, B, or C. I trust you. If it involves less than $100, please made the decision yourself and take a note (the situation, how you handled it, what it cost) in one document, so we can review and adjust each week. Just focus on making our customers happy.\u201d I expected the worst, and guess what? Everything worked, minus a few expected hiccups here and there. I later increased the threshold to $500, then $1,000, and the \u201creviews\u201d of decisions went from weekly, to monthly, to quarterly, to\u2014once people were polished\u2014effectively never. This experience underscored two things for me: 1) To get huge, good things done, you need to be okay with letting the small, bad things happen. 2) People\u2019s IQs seem to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them. Fast-forward to December 26, 2006. I\u2019ve finished writing The 4-Hour Workweek, and I sit down after a lovely Christmas to think about the upcoming April launch. What to do? I had no idea, so I tracked down roughly a dozen best-selling authors. I asked each questions like, \u201cWhat were the biggest wastes of time and money for your last book launch? What would you never do again? What would you do more of? If you had to choose one place to focus $10,000, where would you focus?\u201d I heard one word repeatedly: blogs. They were apparently both very powerful and under-appreciated. My first question was, \u201cWhat the hell is a blog?\u201d My next questions were \u201cHow are people currently trying to reach bloggers?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the least crowded channel?\u201d The people pitching bloggers were generally using email first and phone second. Even though those were my strengths, I decided to experiment with in-person meetings at conferences. Why? Because I felt my odds would be better as one out of five people in a lounge, rather than one email out of 500 emails in an overflowing inbox. I packed my bags and headed to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show in January, which had more than 150,000 attendees in 2005. It\u2019s like the Super Bowl of technology releases, where all the geeks get to play with new toys. I never even walked in the front door. I parked myself at the offsite Seagate-sponsored BlogHaus lounge, where bloggers were invited to relax, recharge their laptops, and drink free booze. I sipped alcohol, asked a lot of dumb questions, and never overtly pitched. I only mentioned the book if someone asked me why I was there (answer: \u201cI just finished my first book, and I\u2019m really nervous about the launch. I\u2019m here to learn more about blogs and technology\u201d). Famous tech blogger Robert Scoble later described my intricate marketing plan as \u201cget drunk with bloggers.\u201d It worked surprisingly well. During the 2007 book launch, I quickly found that most media rightly don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about book launches. They care about stories, not announcements, so I asked myself, \u201cWhat if I couldn\u2019t pitch my product directly? What if I had to sell around the product?\u201d Well, I could showcase people from the book who\u2019ve completely redesigned their lives (human interest); I could write about unrelated crazy experiments, but drive people to my book-focused website (Google \u201cGeek to Freak\u201d to see the result. It was my first-ever viral blog post); I could popularize a new term and aim for pop culture (see \u201clifestyle design\u201d on page 278 in Tools of Titans); I could go meta and make the launch itself a news item (I also did this with my video \u201cbook trailer\u201d for The 4-Hour Body, as well as the BitTorrent partnership for The 4-Hour Chef). People don\u2019t like being sold products, but we all like being told stories. Work on the latter. This kicked off in 2007 to 2008. See page 250 in Tools of Titans for full details. In 2008, I owned a home in San Jose, California, and its value cratered. More accurately, the bank owned the home and I had an ill-conceived adjustable-rate mortgage. On top of that, I was on the cusp of moving to San Francisco. To sell would have meant a $150,000 loss. Ultimately, I picked up and moved to San Francisco, regardless, leaving my San Jose home empty. For months, friends pressured me to rent it, emphasizing how I was flushing money down the toilet otherwise. I eventually buckled and followed their advice. Even with a property management company, regular headaches and paperwork ensued. Regret followed. One introspective night, I had some wine and asked myself: \u201cDo I really need to make money back the same way I\u2019m losing it?\u201d If you lose $1,000 at the blackjack table, should you try and recoup it there? Probably not. If I\u2019m \u201closing\u201d money via the mortgage payments on an empty house, do I really need to cover it by renting the house itself? No, I decided. I could much more easily create income elsewhere (e.g., speaking gigs, consulting, etc.) to put me in the black. Humans are very vulnerable to a cognitive bias called \u201canchoring,\u201d whether in real estate, stocks, or otherwise. I am no exception. I made a study of this (a lot of good investors like Think Twice by Michael Mauboussin), and shortly thereafter sold my San Jose house at a large loss. Once my attention and mind space was freed up, I quickly made it back elsewhere. From 2008 to 2009, I began to ask myself, \u201cWhat if I could only subtract to solve problems?\u201d when advising startups. Instead of answering, \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d I tried first to hone in on answering, \u201cWhat should we simplify?\u201d For instance, I always wanted to tighten the conversion fishing net (the percentage of visitors who sign up or buy) before driving a ton of traffic to one of my portfolio companies. One of the first dozen startups I worked with was named Gyminee. It was rebranded Daily Burn, and at the time, they didn\u2019t have enough manpower to do a complete redesign of the site. Adding new elements would\u2019ve been time-consuming, but removing them wasn\u2019t. As a test, we eliminated roughly 70% of the \u201cabove the fold\u201d clickable elements on their homepage, focusing on the single most valuable click. Conversions immediately improved 21.1%. That quick-and-dirty test informed later decisions for much more expensive development. The founders, Andy Smith and Stephen Blankenship, made a lot of great decisions, and the company was acquired by IAC in 2010. I\u2019ve since applied this \u201cWhat if I could only subtract . . . ?\u201d to my life in many areas, and I sometimes rephrase it as \u201cWhat should I put on my not-to-do list?\u201d Though wordy, I have asked variations of this question many times since 2004. It used to end with, \u201c. . . allow me to go on vacation for 4 to 8 weeks,\u201d but that\u2019s no longer enough. Given the spread of broadband, it\u2019s extremely easy to take a \u201cvacation\u201d to Brazil or Japan and still work nonstop on your business via laptop. This kind of subtle self-deception is a time bomb. For the last 5 years, I\u2019ve asked myself, in effect, \u201cWhat can I put in place so that I can go completely off the grid for 4 to 8 weeks?\u201d To entrepreneurs who are feeling burned out, this is also the question I pose most often. Two weeks isn\u2019t enough, as you can let fires erupt and then attempt to repair things when you return. Four to eight\u00a0weeks (or more) doesn\u2019t allow you to be a firefighter. It forces you to put systems and policies in place, ditch ad-hoc email-based triage, empower other people with rules and tools, separate the critical few from the trivial many, and otherwise create a machine that doesn\u2019t require you behind the driver\u2019s wheel 24/7. Here\u2019s the most important point: The systems far outlive the vacation, and when you come home, you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019ve taken your business (and life) to the next level. This is only possible if you work on your business instead of in your business, as Michael Gerber might say. I lifted this question around 2012 from former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich. I read about it in Buck Up, Suck Up . . . and Come Back When You Foul Up: 12 Winning Secrets from the War Room, written by James Carville and Paul Begala, the political strategists behind Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign \u201cwar room.\u201d Here\u2019s the excerpt that stuck with me: Newt Gingrich is one of the most successful political leaders of our time. Yes, we disagreed with virtually everything he did, but this is a book about strategy, not ideology. And we\u2019ve got to give Newt his due. His strategic ability\u2014his relentless focus on capturing the House of Representatives for the Republicans\u2014led to one of the biggest political landslides in American history. Now that he\u2019s in the private sector, Newt uses a brilliant illustration to explain the need to focus on the big things and let the little stuff slide: the analogy of the field mice and the antelope. A lion is fully capable of capturing, killing, and eating a field mouse. But it turns out that the energy required to do so exceeds the caloric content of the mouse itself. So a lion that spent its day hunting and eating field mice would slowly starve to death. A lion can\u2019t live on field mice. A lion needs antelope. Antelope are big animals. They take more speed and strength to capture and kill, and once killed, they provide a feast for the lion and her pride. A lion can live a long and happy life on a diet of antelope. The distinction is important. Are you spending all your time and exhausting all your energy catching field mice? In the short term it might give you a nice, rewarding feeling. But in the long run you\u2019re going to die. So ask yourself at the end of the day, \u201cDid I spend today chasing mice or hunting antelope?\u201d Another way I often approach this is to look at my to-do list and ask: \u201cWhich one of these, if done, would render all the rest either easier or completely irrelevant?\u201d Since starting deep work with \u201cplant medicines\u201d in 2013 (see James Fadiman, page 100), I\u2019ve doubled and tripled down on cultivating more daily appreciation and present-state awareness. The above is one of the questions I ask myself. It\u2019s accompanied by complementary tools and rituals like the 5-Minute Journal (page 146), the Jar of Awesome (page 570), and thinking of \u201cdaily wins\u201d before bed a\u0300 la Peter Diamandis (page 373). To reiterate what I\u2019ve said elsewhere in this book, type-A personalities have goal pursuit as default hardwiring. This is excellent for producing achievement, but also anxiety, as you\u2019re constantly future-focused. I\u2019ve personally decided that achievement is no more than a passing grade in life. It\u2019s a C+ that gets you limping along to the next grade. For anything more, and certainly for anything approaching happiness, you have to want what you already have. This question and the next both came about in 2015. These days, more than any other question, I\u2019m asking \u201cWhat would this look like if it were easy?\u201d If I feel stressed, stretched thin, or overwhelmed, it\u2019s usually because I\u2019m overcomplicating something or failing to take the simple/easy path because I feel I should be trying \u201charder\u201d (old habits die hard). This is somewhat self-explanatory. Dan Sullivan is the founder and president of a company called Strategic Coach that has saved the sanity of many serial entrepreneurs I know. One of Dan\u2019s sayings is: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got enough money to solve the problem, you don\u2019t have the problem.\u201d In the beginning of your career, you spend time to earn money. Once you hit your stride in any capacity, you should spend money to earn time, as the latter is nonrenewable. It can be hard to make and maintain this gear shift, so the above question is in my regular journaling rotation. This isn\u2019t a question\u2014it\u2019s a fundamental reset. \u201cNo hurry, no pause\u201d was introduced to me by Jenny Sauer-Klein (jennysauerklein.com), who, along with Jason Nemer (page 46), co-created AcroYoga. The expression is one of the \u201c9 Principles of Harmony\u201d from Breema, a form of bodywork she studied for many years. I routinely write \u201cNo hurry, no pause\u201d at the top of my notebooks as a daily reminder. In effect, it\u2019s shorthand for Derek Sivers\u2019s story of the 45-minute versus 43-minute bike ride (page 190)\u2014you don\u2019t need to go through life huffing and puffing, straining and red-faced. You can get 95% of the results you want by calmly putting one foot in front of the other. One former Navy SEAL friend recently texted me a principle used in their training: \u201cSlow is smooth. Smooth is fast.\u201d Perhaps I\u2019m just getting old, but my definition of luxury has changed over time. Now, it\u2019s not about owning a lot of stuff. Luxury, to me, is feeling unrushed. No hurry, no pause. *** So, kids, those are my questions. May you find and create many of your own. Be sure to look for simple solutions. If the answer isn\u2019t simple, it\u2019s probably not the right answer. ### Tools of Titans is available at Barnes & Noble, Amazon,\u00a0Books-A-Million,\u00a0iBooks,\u00a0Indiebound, Indigo, and more.
