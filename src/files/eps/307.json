This episode features entrepreneur and supermodel Karlie Kloss \u2013 that\u2019s two Ks. You can find her on Instagram and elsewhere @karliekloss \u2013 K-A-R-L-I-E-K-L-O-S-S. Karlie was discovered at a local charity fashion show at age 13, and by this point, I think she\u2019s been on 45, 50 covers \u2013 something like that. Karlie\u2019s fashion career quickly took off, and she has walked for top designers, including Oscar de la Renta, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen, and Versace, among others. She\u2019s also starred in many major campaigns, including Adidas \u2013 or Adidas, depending on where you\u2019re listening to this \u2013 Donna Karan, Dolce and Gabbana, Dior, Calvin Klein, Carolina Hererra \u2013 if I\u2019m getting that right \u2013 showing my stripes here \u2013 and Swarovski, among many, many others. But I wanted to have Karlie on this show not just because of her modeling career, of course, which I think gets discounted because thousands \u2013 tens of thousands of women or girls come into the world of modeling, and very few make it to the top and very few last a long time, and very, very few still are able to translate it to other things. Outside of modeling, Karlie\u2019s passion for technology led her to take coding classes, learning to program. Inspired by coding\u2019s endless possibilities, she then launched Kode With Klossy \u2013 K-O-D-E \u2013 Kode With Klossy, a nonprofit that empowers young women to learn to code and become leaders in tech, which in 2018 will expand to 50 camps in 25 cities and may go well beyond that. Time magazine has recognized Karlie for her entrepreneurship and philanthropic work on its Time 100 List, and she was also featured on the covers of Fast Company and Forbes for her work with Kode With Klossy. Karlie hosts Freeform six-part series, Movie Night With Karlie Kloss, as a correspondent for the Netflix original series, Bill Nye Saves the World. And \u2013 this will come up again at the very end, but if you are interested in learning more about Karlie\u2019s coding camps \u2013 and application deadlines are coming soon \u2013 check out KodeWithKlossy.com/apply. That\u2019s Kode With Klossy \u2013 all Ks \u2013 KodeWithKlossy.com/apply. And without further ado, please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation with Karlie Kloss. Karlie, welcome to the show. Karlie Kloss: Hi. Thank you for having me, Tim. Tim Ferriss: I am so thrilled to have you here, and I just want to make a few observations slash comments up front. So, the first is \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Uh-oh. This could go anywhere. Tim Ferriss: I have a researcher who helps me with some prep documents \u2013 I certainly do my own prep \u2013 and his documents are usually very straightforward. He is affectionately called \u201cThe Crazy Bulgarian.\u201d He\u2019s not crazy \u2013 I just thought that he should trademark that. He is from Bulgaria. And he put a note at the top of yours \u2013 he never adds notes \u2013 and the note is, so open parentheses, \u201cNOTE,\u201d in all caps \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Oh my gosh. Uh-oh. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 \u201cShe sounds like the nicest person on the planet,\u201d end parentheses. So, that \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Wow. That\u2019s quite the compliment. Thank you. Tim Ferriss: And so, that caught my attention. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Thank you. Thank you. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0And I should also say that I have a face made for audio, and this is a new \u2013 relatively new experiment with video, and this is the highest beauty differential that I\u2019ve ever had on my show. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0No, no, no, no, no. Come on. Tim Ferriss: And I\u2019m okay with it. So \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Maybe height, but not the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Height, also. So, if those of you who are listening through your earholes want to see a shiny, bulbous head gnome on video, then you can find me side-by-side with Karlie \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Next to a giraffe \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Next to a giraffe. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0\u2013 which is me. Yes. Tim Ferriss: So, I wanted to start with talking about modeling. And there are a lot of beautiful people on this planet \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: \u2014and there are many people who go into modeling, and there are very, very few who get to where you are. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0[Inaudible] Tim Ferriss: And it strikes me that there are some, it would seem success cases of, in this case, women who have gone off to build incredible businesses, like Kathy Ireland, and there are others. So, I wanted to start with asking you if you had, when you were getting started or even now, any role models among \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Oh my gosh. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 women or men \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Of course. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 who have gone from modeling to do other things. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I mean you certainly mentioned one \u2013 Kathy Ireland. There\u2019s a long list. Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Gisele \u2013 many women who are in the industry and have used their platform of voice or experiences to build businesses or to make meaningful impact in the world in whatever way they\u2019re passionate about, and like, for me, that is success, and, I don\u2019t know, yeah, I did not anticipate working in fashion or being a model, but I recognized somewhere along the line that there\u2019s so much more you can do with it, and the women who have come before me certainly have proved that. Tim Ferriss: It seems like, from the outside looking in, that much like, say, entertainment, the machinery of fashion, beauty, and so on probably has a lot of casualties. Meaning it just chews up \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and spits out a lot of people. There\u2019s really high \u2013 it would seem to be \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0There\u2019s a lot of turnover. Tim Ferriss: A lot of turnover. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What were some of the key decisions that you and/or your family or people like managers made that helped you to navigate \u2013 to avoid some of the most common pitfalls? Maybe you could just \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah, of course. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 start with like what are some of the most common mistakes and pitfalls? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Sure. I mean, honestly, Tim, I feel like I\u2019m living my own version of a Cinderella story or an American dream. I mean I have been able to travel the world and have been able to learn from the most extraordinary people. I\u2019m sititng here with you, talking. I mean this is \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m living a dream every day. And you know, I certainly did not anticipate going into fashion or being a model. I had a very different kind of career path in mind, and I had this opportunity and I took it, but \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What was the opportunity? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0So, I was \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Now, you grew up in the Midwest. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I grew up in the Midwest and my father\u2019s a doctor. He\u2019s an emergency room physician, one of the most hardworking people you\u2019ll ever meet and so selfless. And I have three sisters, and my mom\u2019s an artist. And so, I just like grew up in this amazing Midwestern, picturesque kind of childhood. And at 13, I was stopped in a mall and asked if I would be interested in walking in a fashion show. At the time, not only did I not care about \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t my life, fashion. I mean, I didn\u2019t even subscribe to magazines. I was focusing school, I was focusing on ballet, academics, and sports. And so, anyway, this idea of modeling was like totally not even in my mind. And so, I didn\u2019t enter this with the ambition of building a career in modeling. I was stopped in a mall at 13, walked in a local charity fashion show to raise money for a local family whose \u00ac\u2013 my friend\u2019s father, her dad had cancer, so it was this charity benefit, and there were scouts there from real agencies, and they took my name and said, \u201cLet\u2019s stay in touch.\u201d I grew a couple inches, fast forward to when I\u2019m 15, and I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: How tall are you at 15? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0At 15? Oh my god, Tim. I was 15 years old and 5\u201911\u201d. Tim Ferriss: Yeah? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0It\u2019s painful being \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m still working on \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a015 years old. Tim Ferriss: 5\u20199\u201d. I\u2019m 40. I\u2019m \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Look, it\u2019s \u2013 Tim Ferriss: \u2013 gonna get there. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I believe in you. I believe in you. And so, anyway, I was 15 years old and I got this opportunity to go to New York for the weekend and meet the designers of Calvin Klein, and they booked me. And I walked in their fashion show, and it completely kind of put me on the map as a new, up and coming model. And it\u2019s been a wild ride ever since that day in the mall when I was stopped. Tim Ferriss: What are the traps? Like what are the common pitfalls? I mean the things that, having grown up on Long Island, and for instance, I mean I grew up at the very end of Long Island, where there are actually a lot of drug problems. And not saying that it\u2019s drugs, although I suspect that could be a piece of it, but like where do people get off track or make mistakes? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Sure. I mean, I think there\u2019s a lot of misconceptions, and I think there\u2019s a lot of generalizations around the fashion industry, around the modeling industry, and you know, I can only speak to my experience, but I\u2019ve had just a really positive experience as a model. Like I said, it\u2019 been my key to the world. I\u2019ve been able to travel the world. I have more frequent flier miles than most CEOs, and I\u2019m \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve been able to see the world and learn so much, learn from so many brilliant people and so, you know, I\u2019ve used it to my advantage. I think that there are aspects of the industry that are really challenging. I think a lot of people tell you no. There\u2019s a lot of competition. Like you said, I mean there\u2019s so many beautiful people. There\u2019s a lot of luck. And I feel like for me, you know, in my Cinderella story, I feel like I was in the right place at the right time, and I had this window of opportunity, and I ran for it. And I have an amazing family who was by my side every step of the way. I mean, starting a career at 15, I think there\u2019s pitfalls to that, just the nature of being 15 and having a lot of pressure on you. so, for me, I had a lot of luck and the right people around me. And I think a lot of young women who want to go into modeling or work in fashion, that\u2019s not always the case. Tim Ferriss: How did your family help you in terms of rules and policies? And the reason I ask this is it seemed like they were quite strict when it came to high school, homework, and so on. So, I was doing some reading prior to this, and a day might look like a 7:00 a.m. flight to new york to do some type of shoot for \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Right. 5:00 a.m. flight. Tim Ferriss: 5:00 a.m. flight that would get international coverage, and then you fly back and you\u2019re doing homework at 7:00 p.m. and so on. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: What were some of the parameters, rules, policies \u2013 anything like that that your parents had to help keep you on track? Because this relates to something that has popped up a few times in this podcast that I think\u2019s really important. So, could you speak to that? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Sure. You know, I had this kind of double life. I was 15 years old and very much figuring out who I am, what \u2013 you know, in high school, I mean you\u2019re figuring out a lot of things. and like I said, I was a 5 foot 11\u201d 15-year-old, so that came with its own set of challenges. But I don\u2019t know, I guess I \u2013 I had this double life, and I would be in school, have a very normal day in class, sitting in the school lunch room with my friends, with my peers, and then I would get on a flight to Paris or New York a couple days a week. I really had this full-time job, even as a freshman in high school. So, I had this double life, and it was before social media, so none of my friends or teachers really knew to the extent of what I was doing. So, I would go to Paris and walk in a couture runway show or be the face of the Dior campaigns globally or on the cover of magazines, and it was before the kind of global connectivity we have now, so I kind of was able to have a very, very normal, real life at the same time I was building this international career. And I think the discipline that \u2013 to my parents, definitely helped me kind of stay really balanced with focusing on academics and focusing on what matters. I mean we still would have normal family dinners, and I would get in trouble if I didn\u2019t \u2013 you know, came home past curfew or \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I had such a normal home life that I think that really was \u2013 that balanced all of these amazing other things out. And I think my parents were always really \u2013 they trusted me. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest things too. They knew that I was \u2013 they trusted me to do the right thing. And that freedom \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of, I don\u2019t know, responsibility I felt with that, and gratitude to my parents because I didn\u2019t want to let them down. And so, I think I never wanted to \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 to ruin that. Tim Ferriss: Sort of betray that confidence. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Betray that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, one of the reasons I ask is I\u2019m fascinated by people who have reached a pinnacle of success in any field who can remain grounded in any capacity. Because it seems that, whether it\u2019s alcohol, power, money \u2013 those are the three that come to mind \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 when you add those, any of those, in quantity, people tend to become more of what they are. Right? So, if they have a small flaw, it gets magnified. And if they\u2019re a small asshole, they become a really big asshole, and there\u2019s real risk when pressure\u2019s added to the container. So, I\u2019m fascinated how people maintain perspective over time so that they don\u2019t become some abomination, like Frankenstein\u2019s version of themselves. And, for instance, a friend of mine I\u2019ve had on this podcast, Chris Sacca, who I\u2019ve had the privilege of \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah, of course. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 watching go from angel investor to fledgling VC to now, you know, Midas Lists, and arguably \u2013 I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s arguable, is his LOWERCASE I fund is, I think, going to be the most successful venture capital fund in the history of venture capital. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Wow. Tim Ferriss: So, he\u2019s really reached a peak, and when I\u2019ve dug in with him as to how he\u2019s maintained some perspective, because he still ultimately is a very middle-class kid who grew up in upstate New York, trying to make ends meet. His parents had him do sweet and sour summers. So, they would help him to find a job that would give him an opportunity to learn and interact with people who were maybe above his pay grade, above his parents pay grade, but then they would also make him take some shitty job, like hauling around heavy things \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Oh, I had plenty of those. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 on a construction site. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I had plenty of those shitty jobs. But you know, so I \u2013 to the extent of the normal life \u2013 this kind of double life that I had \u2013 my normal life, I really \u2013 I can\u2019t stress it enough. It was very normal. Like I mean I still had my chores \u2013 doing the dishes, taking out the trash, like every 15-year-old. Didn\u2019t matter if I was on the cover of international Vogues, like I was still coming home and doing my homework and taking out the trash. And also, beyond just my parents, my sisters. I have three sisters that I\u2019m really close with. And some of my best friends \u2013 my core group of girlfriends from growing up that I\u2019ve known since kindergarten are still some of my best friends. And so, I think there\u2019s this \u2013 I feel really grateful that I\u2019ve been able to, I don\u2019t know, keep my feet on the ground, very much so. And also, I have a lot of people around me who would bat me over the head and like beat me up if I didn\u2019t, you know? They wouldn\u2019t allow it. I don\u2019t know. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, the support structures also \u2013 people might be asking \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I lived in the Midwest. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 themselves, like, \u201cWell, okay, you grew up that way. Fantastic. I didn\u2019t grow up that way, so it\u2019s not actionable.\u201d And then what I would say is, \u201cNot true.\u201d Why would I explore this? It\u2019s because you can actually build in \u2013 it\u2019s like, all right, what is the version, if you are hoping to achieve a certain modicum of success, like what are the chores that you can engineer into your life so that you maintain some perspective? Are there ways to do it? Right? Maybe it\u2019s volunteering once a week. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: And that helps you to not only, hopefully, ultimately achieve some success, but to achieve also some contentment and life outside of focusing only on your personal success, right? Which is actually a segue of sorts to \u2013 I\u2019m going to get there. I\u2019m going to talk about coding very, very shortly, but I\u2019m going to get there vis-\u00e0-vie books. So, I want to ask about books. Because I had read \u2013 maybe true, maybe not \u2013 that you don\u2019t actually watch very much television. And so, I was like, all right, great, well, let\u2019s talk about books, then. Are there any particular books that you have gifted the most to other people or reread often yourself? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0So, I love podcasts, and I love audiobooks. I feel like I\u2019m somebody who learns by listening. I retain information better. So, I do like TV, but I just don\u2019t have a ton of time for it. I feel like I\u2019m constantly on the go and so I\u2019m listening to audiobooks, whether I\u2019m walking through airport security or in a cab to the airport. And I love \u2013 there\u2019s this book, The Four Agreements, that I recently gave my sisters, who are graduating from college. And I just think it\u2019s got a lot of great principles and ideas. Tim Ferriss: Are there any particular podcasts that are your go-to? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0So, I love learning about things. I love learning about entrepreneurs, I like learning about \u2013 I love listening to conversations. I mean I guess that\u2019s one thing too that I feel like in my real life, I get to ask people. I am sitting here with you, Tim. I mean, what a privilege that is, the access that I have. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re welcome to rescind that comment later. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. But I love listening to conversations. I love your work. I love Guy, How I Built This. I love listening to conversations. Tim Ferriss: So, The Four Agreements, just for people who aren\u2019t familiar, has come up quite a few times in this podcast, and I also recently found out that Tom Brady had been gifting this book a whole lot as well. It has to \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0That\u2019s good company to be in. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 catch you at the right time, I think, for it to be applicable, but the reason I brought up \u2013 you were going to say? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0No, I was just going to say, you know, I\u2019m 25, and I feel like it\u2019s to the point of the timing \u2013 because someone gave it to me for my birthday, and I just think that it really does come down to kind of this \u2013 I think we\u2019re always evolving, always growing, and should be always learning, at least I hope I am. And it really makes you focus inward, and I think there\u2019s \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter how old or young you are, I think that\u2019s something that I really value, is growing as a human being. And it certainly kind of helps you think about ways to grow and to focus as a human being. Tim Ferriss: So, other ways to grow. We\u2019re going to get to it in two seconds. I brought up books because books involve writing, sort of expressing thought, in some cases on paper, some cases in audio. And there\u2019s a craft, there\u2019s a certain elegance to good writing. And I have been fascinated by coding and coders for a very long time, and the fact that you can have, say, a very, very good coder get more done than the next ten if he or she is just very, very elegant and can find non-obvious solutions in what they\u2019re trying to execute. And I\u2019ve spent a very small amount of time with a guy named Chad Fowler, actually, who showed me many years ago the basics of Ruby. It was just in one afternoon, but he used natural language to help me get a grasp on it because he speaks Hindi and I\u2019m fascinated by different languages and was an East Asian studies major, so I\u2019m fascinated by writing systems in Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc. And so, I wanted to ask you, of all the many, many things, of the hundreds and thousands of things that you could do with your time, how did you get exposed to coding? And walk me through your first experience or experiences with that. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Well, I love the way that you explain it as a language, and that\u2019s really what it is. And I think that, like any language, it\u2019s a medium that you can express yourself, that you can express creative ideas, and that is why I think it\u2019s so powerful. I got exposed to it because I\u2019m just a super curious, like annoyingly curious person. I ask a lot of questions, and I love understanding how things work. I love understanding how the world around me works and how science and math can be ways to explain that. But I work in a really creative industry, and, I don\u2019t know, I guess, at a certain point, a couple of years ago, I wanted to understand what \u201ccode\u201d was. It was a term that I kept hearing \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What prompted it? Was it a person, a conversation? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah, I mean I was meeting a lot of entrepreneurs. I was watching the entire world, especially fashion and media be transformed by technology, and I was like, what is it that a handful of people who are engineers and building huge enterprise value \u2013 what is the secret language that they know that the rest of us don\u2019t, and code? And I was like, what is code, and how can I learn it? So, I took a boot camp. I took one week, and even in \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Where was it? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0In New York, at the Flatiron School. Tim Ferriss: Who introduced you to that? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0This guy, Avi Flombaum. And he is a great teacher, and he started this school, and he taught me Ruby, exactly as you. So, it\u2019s a very intuitive kind of language. And even in a short time, I was able to kind of understand high-level, big principles, and the fact that you can use code to, you know, write a line of code that performs a function, and you can build ideas using this language. And that to me was just so mind blowing to understand how the tech that we touch every day \u2013 how it works, and to take it one step further, but to actually be able to write it yourself and to express your ideas, and to be able to \u2013 I mean you\u2019re a man of \u2013 you\u2019re so efficient, Tim, it\u2019s really inspiring. You\u2019re so organized and so efficient. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m organized for maybe like two hours a day, so you\u2019re seeing my two hours. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0No. You are. It\u2019s impressive. And I just think that like even you can build tech to enable that and to scale that. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so powerful, is the ability to scale ideas or scale problem solving using code. And I think that there\u2019s so much opportunity that has yet to really even be built in this kind of intersection of \u2013 many intersections of kind of creative industries from the perspective of someone writing code who has different life experiences or passions, maybe, than most engineers sitting in Silicon Valley today. Tim Ferriss: And you take this class, you learn the basics of Ruby with Avi. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0With Avi. Tim Ferriss: Alright. And what is Kode With Klossy? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0So, Kode With Klossy is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a \u201cK,\u201d folks. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s with a \u201cK\u201d \u2013 Tim Ferriss: K-O-D-E. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0\u2013 is my organization where we teach girls to learn how to code and empower the next generation of tech leaders. So, we do that by running summer camps across the country, and we teach girls the ABCs \u2013 so Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, CSS \u2013 enough to be able to build something. So, our camps are across the country and they\u2019re two weeks long, and they\u2019re totally free. And we have these amazing girls who come into our camps and learn these skills, and it\u2019s amazing what they\u2019re able to build. And not only just the way that they\u2019re able to build their ideas, but what they\u2019re passionate about \u2013 so, if it\u2019s like making social impact, helping their community \u2013 they\u2019re able to build something and recognize the impact that they can have. And that\u2019s really empowering. And that, for a girl who\u2019s kind of, you know, at that point in life where you\u2019re figuring out what you think you can be or what you think you can\u2019t, that\u2019s really empowering. Tim Ferriss: Hmm. I need to learn to code. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0You need to \u2013 I feel like you \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I need to learn to code. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0\u2013 you need to come to our camp. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s embarrassing that I\u2019ve been in Silicon Valley, or \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m no longer there. We\u2019re in Austin, and I live here, but 17 years in Silicon Valley, and I think I was too \u2013 I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t be good at it. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I felt the same way. Tim Ferriss: I had a deep insecurity that when I scratched the surface, I would see the infinite complexity of something that I could at best only be mediocre at. And so, I stuck my head in the sand. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I disagree. I think that that\u2019s one of the barriers to entry. I think that\u2019s why a lot of people don\u2019t ever try. I mean, who am I? I don\u2019t have a \u2013 I don\u2019t work in Silicon Valley. I didn\u2019t go to college. But I\u2019m curious, and it\u2019s something that can be learned, like anything else. It is a language, and I think that a lot of people let that get in the way of taking that first step. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you know, it strikes me too that, I think perhaps in my mind, I\u2019ve given myself an out which is actually really flimsy, and that is that it\u2019ll be too hard to learn to code. In my mind, learning to code is building, you know, the next super app to go gain a hundred million users. Whereas in reality \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example from my own experience. Then I have some questions for you so I don\u2019t talk too much. This is what happens with too much caffeine, but \u2013 so, I\u2019ve always been very, very insecure about my voice. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Oh, come on. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and that\u2019s part of the reason why I wanted to do the podcast, is to beat that out of myself, or to get more comfortable with my voice. And if anyone listens to my earlier episodes \u2013 say the introductions to my early, early, early episodes, and then later you will see the confidence build over time. I was really unsure of myself in the beginning. And I\u2019m still unsure of myself in some ways, but I\u2019ve always been fearful of singing, any type of singing. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0[Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: I would never do it. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Look, I\u2019m right there with you. Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019ve always had, on my new year\u2019s resolutions almost every year for the last six years \u2013 along those lines \u2013 voice lessons. Never did it until a few months ago. Just started. And what I realized very quickly is that I don\u2019t have to become a good singer to get a credible value out of these voice lessons. Because I\u2019ve learned enough now \u2013 I\u2019ve certainly improved, but I\u2019m not ready for any opera \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I think this might be your debut. Tim Ferriss: We will see. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0After the podcast. Tim Ferriss: After the podcast. But yeah, I won\u2019t impose that on anyone right now. It will be very, very harsh. But when you learn the basics of any skill \u2013 and I already know this, so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve been so blind to it with both singing and I think now coding \u2013 even if you never do anything with it per se, suddenly you hear everything \u2013 in the case of voice, you listen to every song you hear differently. And so, your enjoyment of that and your appreciation of it are ten-xed. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: And I would imagine that when you learn the basics of coding \u2013 even if you don\u2019t use it to push you off into a different career, it gives you an entirely different lens through which you can look at everything that is being built and how things work. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0A thousand [inaudible] [00:32:46]. Tim Ferriss: And that alone, to have that gift, to look through a different lens through the rest of your life, putting in a week or two seems like a very potentially worthwhile use of time. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Absolutely. Tim, I mean, just on that point, it\u2019s like, you know, I think even if you understand high level how things are built, you can understand what is possible. And I think that that\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting, even just as an entrepreneur. You don\u2019t have to \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s probably so many people that you\u2019ve sat with and that you met in Silicon Valley that \u2013 even a friend of mine, Kevin Systrom, founded Instagram \u2013 or one of the cofounders of Instagram. And he wrote lines of code early on, and actually, I think that was one of the a-ha moments. I knew him as a friend, and I was like, \u201cWait, Kevin, you actually know how to code? You actually built lines of code to build this tool, this platform that reaches so many people?\u201d It put a human element to it. And I think the idea of even learning a little bit of what code is and how it builds things, it makes you realize what could be possible. And I think, for people who want to build businesses, you don\u2019t have to be the main engineer, but there is this kind of literacy that I think is important. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I mean it certainly seems to be the new literacy \u2013 or one of the new forms of literacy that, over time, as \u201csoftware eats the world,\u201d to borrow Marc Andreessen\u2019s expression, if you don\u2019t want to be displaced, if you want to be able to compete, you need to at least understand the ABCs. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And easy for me to say with my platform and microphone as someone who\u2019s being a bit hypocritical, since I only did one afternoon of Ruby with Chad. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Oh, until you come to my coding camp. Tim Ferriss: Until I come to your camp. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0But the other thing is too, Tim, is that part of the reason why I wanted to take a class beyond just wanting to understand how the world was being transformed by technology and what specifically that meant, but it\u2019s like, because I was so intimidated by it, because I work in fashion, because I am not someone who maybe looks like the most \u2013 you know, most people in Silicon Valley or engineers, I don\u2019t know, I wanted \u2013 there\u2019s something in me, I think, that wanted to do what I think would be the harvest possible thing to do, or like \u2013 I don\u2019t know, and this was not even about building an organization and helping other people do the same thing. This was just for me, selfishly. I wanted to learn something really hard. And I think that there\u2019s probably a part of me that\u2019s like, you know, insecure \u2013 speaking about the fact that I know that I\u2019m more than just what people see me on the outside. And I think that insecurity probably has driven me to want to keep doing more. And it just \u2013 I am just a really curious, passionate person, and I think this \u2013 I\u2019ve always been really interested in math and science, and I don\u2019t know, I think that that\u2019s partially why I tackled this challenge too, initially, was like, I want to learn what is going to be \u2013 what do people really think is hard to learn? I want to learn it. Tim Ferriss: Well, so, let\u2019s talk about challenge for a second \u2013 or more than a second. And I don\u2019t know the attribution to this quote I really like, which is \u201cEverything you want is just outside of your comfort zone.\u201d And I\u2019m sometimes better at practicing that than others. But I\u2019d love to talk about discomfort for a second. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss: Because I think people have \u2013 there are many misconceptions about anyone who has a lot of public exposure, like yourself. So, one might be, \u201cAh, she\u2019s just a pretty face.\u201d Right? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss: Which is not true. Another might be, \u201cOh, it\u2019s all come very easily. It\u2019s all been very easy. It\u2019s just been home runs from day one.\u201d So, what I\u2019d love to ask you is, could you tell us about \u2013 you can choose \u2013 we can talk about both \u2013 like a dark, slash, hard time, what prompted it, and how you came out of it, or a failure that, looking back, helped set the stage or teach you something that led to success later. And the more specific, the better, because I want to humanize this a little bit for people who might feel like this is \u2013 that you\u2019re perfect. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I\u2019m far from perfect. So far from perfect, it\u2019s like beyond, but for me, I think that there have been many failures along the way, but also I am a really \u2013 I am the toughest person on myself, and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let\u2019s talk about a specific one. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I mean there are so many moments I can just think about in my fashion career, you know, where I didn\u2019t quite \u2013 I mean it\u2019s funny how you define like a failure, or even like dark moments. I have built my career over the past ten years of my life, and I was 15 years old when I started that, and I think there\u2019s just natural human growth that happens over those ten years that\u2019s really important, and no matter what you\u2019re doing, you need to take those failures and challenge yourself to make yourself grow from them and be better.\nAnd for me, I think because I live in a more public life \u2013 or aspects of my life are more public, those failures or dark periods of growing up, of coming into your own, of growing into your own body, like that\u2019s even more criticized or, you know, more people can see it. And so, I think for me, I definitely \u2013 so many different periods of my life where like, you know, being in the profession that I\u2019m in, it\u2019s very focused on the outside and your body. And as a teenage girl, growing into your body, I mean there are so many times I\u2019ve gone into a fitting where the clothes don\u2019t fit, and that just has made me feel so shitty about myself, and it\u2019s not necessarily my fault, it\u2019s not necessarily the clothes\u2019 fault, it\u2019s just shitty. It makes you feel horrible \u2013 it\u2019s made me feel horrible about myself. And I think there was kind of this point progressively through my career that I was like, I am so much more than just like my measurements or my body. I have so many ideas. I\u2019ve got so much drive. I know that I have so much to give the world, and I really want to help other people, and I know that I\u2019m not necessarily doing that \u2013 or the extent of my self worth or value cannot be just on fitting the clothes or not. And I think that there was like a real shift in me and just understanding \u2013 I don\u2019t know, understanding how and what to do to keep growing. Tim Ferriss: So, are there any particular, for instance, routines, habits, on a daily or weekly basis that help you to continue functioning at a high level? Or that just help you, that you like? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Like what are some specifics \u2013 my listeners always the specifics. Are there any particular \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0[Inaudible]. I love meditating. You know, I think \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Okay. How do you \u2013 how, when, how long do you practice meditating? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Okay. So, I\u2019m not as probably good or disciplined as many of your listeners out there, but whenever I can, to the point of \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Do you use an app, do you use \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I use Headspace. I learned TM. But I just do it whenever, wherever I can. So, you know, this morning, getting ready, I wake up, stretch, breathe, put in, you know, ten minutes of Headspace, go to the gym, or vice versa, work out and then meditate, and then start my day. You know, I really have learned how important it is to take care of myself mentally as well as physically, because I think, you know, part of being in \u2013 just part of life is staying mentally healthy and balanced, and I think especially in an industry that there is so much volatility \u2013 I mean to the point of \u2013 models and turnover, there\u2019s a lot of failures, daily, of jobs you don\u2019t get or things that you\u2019re \u2013 I have been told that I\u2019m too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny, too this, too that, everything. I mean it\u2019s like \u2013 and that is such a \u2013 if that doesn\u2019t mess with your head as a teenage girl growing up anyway, then I mean, come on. So, again, for me, you know, having an amazing support group around me, having like really \u2013 my family, my friends \u2013 and then having outlets that fill my cup. So, for me, investing in my learning, sincerely, is something I love. I love learning new things. I love learning from people. I love experiencing new things. And I love helping people, not for the sake of, like, any reason other than just I love sharing opportunities for other people to better themselves, their lives too. Tim Ferriss: Well, let\u2019s talk about one outlet, slash, maybe stress release valve, which is the exercise. Right? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0So, what does a sample morning exercise routine look like? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Totally. Tim Ferriss: Very specifically, and how long does it take? What exercises are you doing? What are you using? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Okay, so, I grew up playing every sport, doing ballet every day. I grew up super, super active, and I live a really busy life today, and I\u2019m on a plane all the time. I mean you know it\u2019s not easy to fit it in, but for me, I make sure that I fit in like a combination of cardio and a combination of strength training. So, I feel best when I\u2019m strong, not skinny. And I like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: So, tell us about a recent workout. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0So, this morning \u2013 woke up, meditated, and worked out for 45 minutes \u2013 all I had time for \u2013 and I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: And did you have breakfast before you worked out? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0After. Tim Ferriss: After? Okay. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0After I worked out. And a combination of running, biking, and some light weights. And just, I kind of do whatever I can whenever I can. So, if I\u2019m in the south of France on a photo shoot, I\u2019ll go for a run and a swim. If I\u2019m here in Austin, I\u2019ll go for a run across that cool bridge and, like, go tour around. Tim Ferriss: Whatever\u2019s available. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Whatever\u2019s available. Tim Ferriss: For strength training, if you had to pick only a handful of exercises that seem to get you the most bang for the buck, what would they be? What comes to mind? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I hate burpees so much \u2013 I hate them so much, but \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You hate them, but it\u2019s a love-hate? Is that \u2013 ? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I hate them \u2013 it\u2019s a love-hate. Because I just \u2013 I hate them so much that I just know they\u2019re probably good for me. Burpees, things that you can do anywhere, so like planking or exercises like things that I do in my hotel room, like if I don\u2019t have time to go down to the gym. So, just simple things like sit-ups, push-ups, dips, all sorts of \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Portable. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0\u2013 really \u2013 yeah, boring things like that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I mean boring but effective. I wanted to get into specifics because I\u2019m always curious, when I meet someone who travels as much as you do, it makes it very clear that the, \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to work out because I\u2019m traveling\u201d excuse is utter bullshit. And I\u2019m always curious how people make do. Right? So, I\u2019ve talked to Triple H, otherwise known as Paul Levesque \u2013 fascinating guy, and he\u2019ll use a stationary bike for \u2013 or elliptical, for, say, even ten, 15 minutes when he first arrives anywhere after shifting time zones, and it seems to fix jet lag for him. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0[Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: Danzig, when they were traveling around touring, one of the very first things they would do is they would choose a hotel based on the gym that was available. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Oh, a hundred percent. Tim Ferriss: And it\u2019s like, Bruce Lee would always travel with his running shoes because he knew no matter what if other things weren\u2019t available, he could run. And it just goes on and on and on. I travel with a number of different bands, as well as \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: an inflatable ball, and it\u2019s incredible what you can do, particularly if you learn calisthenic exercises like burpees or pistols, which are one-legged squats, you can get a brutal workout in your own hotel room. Or Jocko Willink, who\u2019s a retired Navy SEAL commander, and he\u2019ll travel with \u2013 or he won\u2019t necessarily travel with, but if he wants to do pull-ups and he can\u2019t find a place to do pull-ups, he\u2019ll grab one of the towels from his room in the hotel and go find the parking structure, and throw it over a bar, and do pull-ups with the towels. So, it\u2019s like there\u2019s \u2013 two observations that I make. No. 1., there\u2019s always a way. But secondly, the most \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0There\u2019s always a way. [Inaudible] that\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s always a way, and in the highest functioning, seemingly busiest people I\u2019ve met almost all make a point to move on a daily basis in some fashion. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0It\u2019s so important \u2013 for me, in my life, it\u2019s crucial. Forget even about how it makes you look, but how it makes you feel and just, for me, brain \u2013 mental, emotional balance, I think, and focus and clarity. It\u2019s like, I can\u2019t start my day without doing something. And to the point of whatever it is, you know, I, in my suitcase, always have my running shoes, always have bands, always have ankle weights, which is really funny when I\u2019m going through airport security and I\u2019ve got like two ankle weights that look like bombs, and you know \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0\u2013 they\u2019re like lead ankle weights, and I get stopped every time and get, you know, questioned. Tim Ferriss: Ankle weights and podcast gear. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0[Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, a bunch of batteries and cables.\u201d Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: \u201cYeah, we need to talk to you.\u201d Karlie Kloss:\u00a0We\u2019re high-risk travelers. Tim Ferriss: Mr. American History X. For those of you who don\u2019t know, I\u2019m very, very bald and have sort of a wrestler-y look to me. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0[Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: So, let\u2019s chat about investing. And by investing, I mean investment of time, energy, maybe in a particular relationship \u2013 I\u2019m going to say you can\u2019t answer with your family. All right? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. Sure. Tim Ferriss: So, I\u2019m going to roll them out. But what would you consider one of the best investments you\u2019ve ever made? And that could be, for instance, Amelia Boone has been on the podcast \u2013 four-time world champion in obstacle course racing. For her, at the time, she was and still is a lawyer, but it was the first $450.00 entry fee for the first, I think it was World\u2019s Toughest Mudder, which she ended up winning, which opened up this entirely new career, right? Doesn\u2019t have to be something like that, but \u2013 you know, in my case could potentially be the idea to put in the time to do a six-episode test for the podcast. Like, holy shit, you know? Was just supposed to be a side gig because I was too burned out writing books, now it turned into a whole thing. What comes to mind for you when you think about some of the best investments of time, energy, money, or decisions? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0So, a number of things. One, the first pair of high heels that I ever owned were $20.00 high heels from Target that I learned how to quote, unquote \u201cwalk,\u201d and those came in very handy when I started my fashion career. And I, with my first paycheck ever, bought a red KitchenAid mixer that still sits on my counter to this day, and thousands of cookies have been made from that little mixer. And I got the idea of starting a vegan cookie charity project from my passion for baking. And that led on to a whole fun project. And \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Take a few sentences just to explain what that is. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0So, that\u2019s really just what it sounds like. It\u2019s a charity project focused on donating school lunches to kids through selling cookies, which, I love to eat cookies, I love to make cookies, and I wanted to kind of have a bake sale of sorts, and so \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Do you have any partners in \u2013 ? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0We partnered with Momofuku Milk Bar, and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for those who don\u2019t know that, look it up. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Look it up. Must visit when you\u2019re in New York. And we made cookies, and we donated over a million school lunches from the sales of these cookies. And that was just this kind of first project where it was really my idea and something that I built and used my voice to take an idea and actually bake a cookie and bake an impact into that product, and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: So, we got the heels, which \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0We got the heels. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 I mean, if you can\u2019t walk in those, you\u2019re going to have issues as a female in fashion. The KitchenAid mixer \u2013 so, KitchenAid, if you\u2019re listening, I\u2019m sure Karlie has very reasonable endorsement rates, so you can reach out. What else? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0And investing in time. You know, honestly, two things, one, I applied back to NYU because I love learning and I wanted to be back in an environment where I could keep growing and learning. And that was at 20 years old. That was after five years already of working full time. And so, I invested back in being a student. And that also led me to taking a coding class. And that led me to starting Kode With Klossy. And \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What did you go in to learn? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I wanted to learn anything, everything. I have so many things that I love \u2013 Tim Ferriss: So, question. I want to \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Because I know you\u2019re really a curious person, too, so I feel like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I am, but I want to dig into the motivation for one second. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, I have some friends, very, very smart, very accomplished, who either didn\u2019t ever go to college or dropped out of college. And for some of them, going back and getting the diploma was just a \u2013 and this is not a bad motivation at all, but they had carried some type of like defensiveness and insecurity about having not gone to college and finished. Was that any piece of it? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0A hundred percent. I was planning on becoming a physician, a doctor, emergency room doctor \u2013 something like my dad, or go to business school, or go to some \u2013 I always planned on having a very \u2013 at least getting a college degree. And so, I think there\u2019s an element of wanting to kind of keep learning more, keep doing more \u2013 not for the sake of getting the degree, but for the sake of being in an environment where I can keep expanding my horizons. And I think the thing is \u2013 and I have that through my job, as well. There are so many ways that I\u2019m able to learn just by traveling and meeting people. And I feel like everybody has that. It\u2019s not just \u2013 I mean, I am a unique situation. I get to travel to crazy places, but I think just, it\u2019s kind of a mindset, a mentality, a perspective of just keeping your eyes and ears open. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any favorite classes or professors besides the coding? Anything come to mind? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I took a feminism class at NYU, which was really fascinating for understanding the history of feminism, academic perspectives, the different waves of feminism \u2013 a lot of academic reading around the topic, beyond just kind of rah-rah, girl power. Tim Ferriss: Alright. So, you mentioned a number of things. Are there any purchases, say, in recent memory \u2013 this is one of my rapid-fire questions \u2013 I know it\u2019s a bit of an awkward transition from feminism, so I apologize to people for that \u2013 but are there any particular purchases that have had a very positive impact on your life? Ideally of the, say, less than a hundred or less than a thousand dollar variety? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I love journaling. On airplanes, I sit for, you know \u2013 especially that flight back to St. Louis is only two hours, so it\u2019s like two hours of uninterrupted time. And every airplane that I\u2019m sitting on, I always journal and brain dump ideas, grocery lists. It\u2019s really pretty remarkable looking back at those journals and thinking how much of the things that I listed out of dreams and goals that I\u2019ve been able to tick off and accomplish, and I think that an investment of a journal, a great Moleskine, certainly has been worthwhile, and really just something that I think is a great exercise. And I really love actually, like I said, taking care of myself \u2013 my mind and body. And so, I always have all these \u2013 in my suitcase, I\u2019ve got all these crazy supplements, like Moon Juice Dust \u2013 they have like Brain Dust and Beauty Dust, and it\u2019s like crazy potions of like Ashwagandha and things that \u2013 like I\u2019m a total sucker and believer that like \u2013 so, I travel with all these potions in my suitcase, along with my bands and ankle weights. Tim Ferriss: When you use the notebooks, what does a page look like, and how do you follow up? So, what I\u2019m curious to know is how things make it from the page into reality, right? Do you go back and figure out what next steps are? Do you write down next steps in a particular way? And people have so many different ways of approaching this. I mean in my case, in my journal \u2013 I wish I had it right here, but I always make a little box in the bottom right-hand corner, and that\u2019s for next steps, based on anything on that page. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Smart. Tim Ferriss: And so, every bottom right-hand corner has next steps. And then I\u2019ll go through, and I\u2019ll be like, eh, alright, that was a stupid idea. Or like, eh, that\u2019s not for now, and I\u2019ll do a second pass and then highlight the kind of like dominoes that I think will topple as many other dominoes as possible. But when you brain dump, or when you put these things on paper, walk us through what that looks like. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Next steps? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0There\u2019s also this app that\u2019s called Wunderlist that\u2019s great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0And for actually having a more digital version of those lists. And then also, things like Slack are great too. The notebook is more just like my real personal, kind of deepest, darkest thoughts, but and ideas and goals, and like, nobody\u2019s judging \u2013 hopefully \u2013 nobody\u2019s reading them. But I think the organization \u2013 you know, I mean I love \u2013 this is the way your brain works. I think my brain is not the most organized. I have a lot of ideas, and I think it\u2019s actually taken a lot of discipline to kind of keep everything moving forward and to \u2013 I definitely think it\u2019s like going through those lists and following up with the people that I need to continue the conversation with, or \u2013 I\u2019ve got an amazing team. I\u2019ve got a great partner who is helping me build Kode With Klossy, building all my businesses. Tim Ferriss: Who is that? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Her name\u2019s Penni Thow. She\u2019s amazing. And I feel like it\u2019s a really collaborative process \u2013 taking those lists and actually turning them into action is more working with my team to bring them to live. Tim Ferriss: One thing I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 and tell me if this is off-base or not, but in doing a lot of homework on you, putting together the dossier \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Uh-oh. I know, first of all, I need to send cookies to your friend, The Crazy \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Oh, The Crazy Bulgarian? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0[Inaudible]. Bulgarian. Tim Ferriss: Oh my god. Crazy Bulgarian, I know you\u2019re listening. You\u2019re in lucky. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0The Crazy Bulgarian. Tim Ferriss: You need some cookies. Don\u2019t forget me. I could use some cookies too. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Done. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll say it\u2019s for my cheat day, but I might actually break that rule. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0On it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I have to be careful around cookies. One of those \u2013 very little portion control when it comes to cookies \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I hear you. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 it turns out. But \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I\u2019ll send you healthy ones. Tim Ferriss: Also send me the unhealthy ones. You can address them to somebody else, and then I\u2019ll just eat them anyway. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Okay [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: The pattern that seemed to pop up was \u2013 and I think this actually makes you a lot smarter than I am in some really deep ways, is when I go through my notebook and I write down what needs to be done next, like what do I need to do next, and it seems like, as I\u2019ve looked through a lot of your history, you are much better at doing one thing that\u2019s really important that I need to improve upon, and that is, not asking, \u201cWhat do I need to do next?\u201d necessarily, but \u201cWho do I need to talk to next?\u201d And whether it\u2019s Kevin Systrom, or say, Casey Neistat, who\u2019s also been on the podcast, really [inaudible] [00:58:39], I\u2019ve had a lot of trouble \u2013 it doesn\u2019t even occur to me to ask for help \u2013 not because I think I have all the answers, but I don\u2019t want to burden people with that \u2013 or there\u2019s some weird baggage that I carry, which is why Amanda Palmer, at one point, the musician, really, and her book has really helped me to learn how to ask for help. But is that accurate? Am I \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0A hundred percent. Oh my gosh. I mean, again, I am somebody who didn\u2019t get a college degree, a business school degree, and I\u2019m trying to build businesses and a nonprofit and scale that impact and grow my team and be a boss. I mean there are so many things that I\u2019m learning as I go. And I think that what I really value is the people that I can lean on as mentors or advisors in figuring it out. And I think that that\u2019s a really important thing that I also kind of had this awakening where I was like, I am in the room with extraordinary people and I\u2019m being afforded that opportunity because of my job, my day job \u2013 being a model, working on big advertising jobs, working in an industry with a lot of creatives. How can I actually best use that to accomplish what I really dream of, what my biggest goals and ambitions are? And I think a lot of people sometimes are afraid to ask for help, and I definitely have \u2013 I ask questions \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You ask for help. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I ask for help. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what my problem is with that. I mean I\u2019ve gotten better, but it\u2019s one of these self-defeating habits of isolating myself that is kind of a \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I do that too. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a default that I need to continually work on. I get better for periods, and then I\u2019m like, oh, no, I need to figure this out. I should be able to figure this out. And like, sit down with my notebook, not always the ideal tool of choice. So, I need to revisit. Amanda, I need your help. I\u2019ll reread your book. If you look at the last handful of years, are there any particular habits, beliefs, tools that have had a tremendously positive impact on your life besides things we\u2019ve mentioned already? So, it can\u2019t be, say, meditation or Headspace or one of those. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah. You know, I think just learning by doing. You know, over the past years, I find it so interesting to just see how much the whole world has changed in so many ways. You know, you mentioned Casey Neistat. I had a conversation with him a number of years ago, where I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: If you want to talk about busy \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yeah, talk about busy. Talk about wake up at \u2013 Tim Ferriss: \u2013 look up Casey Neistat. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0He\u2019s amazing. And he really helped me realize that I could not just be a canvas for creators, but I could be a creator myself. And I think there was kind of this overall shift in, certainly in fashion, in social media, enabling a platform and a voice for everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter if you are the model, your voice can be heard in the same way the brand or designers can. And that extends for everyone, and that\u2019s beyond just fashion. But there was this kind of shift in my own perspective of realizing that my ideas had value, and that I could be a creator and share what I was experiencing and learning and doing beyond just what was translated by somebody else or \u2013 I could be heard. I could be \u2013 what am I saying? I didn\u2019t have to just be seen but I could also be heard. And I think that there was something really empowering in that, and that\u2019s been kind of a collective shift over the years. And I think this kind of democratization of ideas and of voices and this kind of, instead of just a handful of people in power at the top, like everybody has the opportunity to build something with their ideas, and that\u2019s to the point of code being this ability to actually actualize that, to realize that. To have ideas that, whether it\u2019s a problem you\u2019re facing or an idea for a company or an idea for making impact, I mean being able to actually build that, even if you\u2019re a 15-year-old girl. I just, I think that there\u2019s something so exciting about there being no rules. And I feel like a lot of the rules that maybe existed in the world or the industry that I work in ten years ago are no longer the case. And I think it\u2019s exciting to see what is ahead of us. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s exciting. Yeah, I mean, there\u2019s certainly still top-down power, and there are \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Sure. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 certain things that require political relationships and so on, but more and more so, the ability to develop bottoms-up power is available to anyone who is willing to learn and compete. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s the good news. The bad news, potentially, is you better fucking compete, because \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0 Yeah. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 guess what? When there are, say, three to four billion additional people coming online in the next handful of years, you have to compete against everybody. And I think that\u2019s a very good thing. But it also means you can learn from everybody \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and that information is available. So, just a few more questions. Billboard \u2013 you\u2019ve probably heard this question before because I like to ask it \u2013 but if you could put a few words, a word, a quote, anything on a billboard \u2013 can\u2019t be an advertisement \u2013 to get a message out to millions or billions of people, metaphorically speaking, what might you put on that billboard? Karlie: Hmm. I feel like that\u2019s \u2013 there are so many things that I probably should be putting on that billboard, but one thing that my dad always used to really hammer home to me and my sisters is \u2013 we would come home from school and if one of us got a bad grade or something, he would say, like, \u201cDid you give it your best?\u201d like only you actually really know. Did you give it your best? Did you study the best you could? Did you go in there as focused as possible? Did you give it your best? And I think that there\u2019s something really important to always just keep in mind, is give it your absolute best. And also be present. I think that\u2019s the other thing, too. Those are two things that I always kind of think about to myself, like am I doing my absolute best? Yes? Then cut myself a break. I can\u2019t compare myself to anyone else, because my best \u2013 only I know what that actually is. And I think being present is a really important exercise, always. Tim Ferriss: Did you give it your best? That\u2019s a really important question. Yeah. I feel like you are giving it your best, at least from the outside looking in. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Definitely trying the best I can. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I mean I certainly don\u2019t have all the answers. I think that\u2019s one thing too, is I\u2019m 25 years old and like all of my \u2013 I\u2019m far from perfect, but I\u2019ve sincerely just given it my best every step of the way and taken opportunities that I\u2019ve been able to have and make the most of them, learn from them, keep growing \u2013 never kind of being satisfied or staying complacent, and then also thinking about how I can help others along the way. Tim Ferriss: So, you have a very exciting year ahead of you, as I\u2019m sure will be many, many years of excitement ahead of you. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Thank you. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m always super eager to support anything related to enabling through education. I mean that\u2019s been a real focus of mine with a number of different organizations over the last ten years or so. What closing comments might you have and ask of the audience, a suggestion to the audience certainly, if they can learn more about how to code or share that with girls or people who may want to attend one of your camps. What would you like to share, ask of, or recommend to the audience? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Well, you have an incredible audience and anyone out there listening, I ask, just, if you know any young women between the ages of 13 and 18 who you think would benefit from learning to code or would be interested, send them to KodeWithKlossy.com to apply for our free camps. We\u2019re going to have a thousand spots. This is a really, really big summer of growth for us \u2013 Tim Ferriss: How long are the camps? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0The camps are two weeks long, 9:00 to 5:00, Monday through Friday, and they are action packed. There is so much that the girls do over the course of these two weeks. And we are growing to 50 camps in 25 cities across the country, so it\u2019s a big summer for us, and we want to get as many amazing young women in these classes and in these camps, so send them to KodeWithKlossy.com to apply. Tim Ferriss: KodeWithKlossy.com. K-O-D-E with \u2013 hopefully you guys can spell that \u2013 K-L-O-S-S-Y.com. What was the age range again? Karlie Kloss:\u00a013 to 18. Tim Ferriss: 13 to 18. So, think about this for a second, folks. You may say, \u201cI don\u2019t know any 13 to 18-year-old girls.\u201d Alright. Do you have any daughters? Do your friends have any daughters? Are you a teacher with female students who might benefit from this? Consider it. This is, in many, many respects the new literacy. And I\u2019m going to get off my lazy ass and stop procrastinating \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0And come to my coding camp. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 and actually give it a shot. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, talk about Where\u2019s Waldo. That\u2019d be easy to pick out. \u201cWho\u2019s the bald, shiny gnome among the 12 to 18-year old girls?\u201d Karlie Kloss:\u00a0No, no, no. Tim Ferriss: \u201cOh, why is Tim Ferris here?\u201d Karlie Kloss:\u00a0You\u2019re the only boy we\u2019ll let in. Tim Ferriss: So, KodeWithKlossy.com. People can find you everywhere of course. Karlie Kloss. @karliekloss, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube. Is there any one of those three that you would prioritize? Karlie Kloss:\u00a0For applying, or for \u2013 ? Tim Ferriss: No, just for people who want to \u2013 Karlie Kloss:\u00a0I love Instagram. That\u2019s my first go-to. Tim Ferriss: That sounds like a native environment for you. So, Instagram, @karliekloss. Kode With Klossy is @kodewithklossy on all the socials and KodeWithKlossy.com. Thank you so much for taking the time today. Karlie Kloss:\u00a0Thank you, Tim. Tim Ferriss: This was really fun. And for people listening, as always, we\u2019ll have links to everything we\u2019ve discussed including the websites, social, books, etc. in the show notes.

age 13, and by this point, i think she\u2019s been on 45, 50 covers \u2013 something like that", "karlie\u2019s fashion career quickly took off, and she has walked for top designers, including oscar de la renta, christian dior, alexander mcqueen, and versace, among others", "she\u2019s also starred in many major campaigns, including adidas \u2013 or adidas, depending on where you\u2019re listening to this \u2013 donna karan, dolce and gabbana, dior, calvin klein, carolina hererra \u2013 if i\u2019m getting that right \u2013 showing my stripes here \u2013 and swarovski, among many, many others", "but i wanted to have karlie on this show not just because of her modeling career, of course, which i think gets discounted because thousands \u2013 tens of thousands of women or girls come into the world of modeling, and very few make it to the top and very few last a long time, and very, very few still are able to translate it to other things", "outside of modeling, karlie\u2019s passion for technology led her to take coding classes, learning to program", "inspired by coding\u2019s endless possibilities, she then launched kode with klossy \u2013 k-o-d-e \u2013 kode with

tim", "i am so thrilled to have you here, and i just want to make a few observations slash comments up front", "so, the first is \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0uh-oh", "this could go anywhere", "i have a researcher who helps me with some prep documents \u2013 i certainly do my own prep \u2013 and his documents are usually very straightforward", "he is affectionately called \u201cthe crazy bulgarian.\u201d he\u2019s not crazy \u2013 i just thought that he should trademark that", "he is from bulgaria", "and he put a note at the top of yours \u2013 he never adds notes \u2013 and the note is, so open parentheses, \u201cnote,\u201d in all caps \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0oh my gosh", "uh-oh", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u2013 \u201cshe sounds like the nicest person on the planet,\u201d end parentheses", "so, that \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0wow", "that\u2019s quite the compliment", "thank you", "and so, that caught my attention", "karlie kloss:\u00a0thank you", "thank you", "tim ferriss:\u00a0and i should also say that i have a face made for audio, and this is a new \u2013 relatively new experiment with video, and this is the highest beauty differential that i\u2019ve ever had on my show", "karlie kloss:\u00a0no, no, no, no, no", "come on", "and i\u2019m okay with it", "so \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0maybe height, but not the \u2013 height, also", "so, if those of you who are listening through your earholes want to see a shiny, bulbous head gnome on video, then you can find me side-by-side with karlie \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0next to a giraffe \u2013 next to a giraffe", "karlie kloss:\u00a0\u2013 which is me", "yes", "so, i wanted to start with talking about modeling", "and there are a lot of beautiful people on this planet \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0absolutely", "\u2014and there are many people who go into modeling, and there are very, very few who get to where you are", "karlie kloss:\u00a0[inaudible] and it strikes me that there are some, it would seem success cases of, in this case, women who have gone off to build incredible businesses, like kathy ireland, and there are others", "so, i wanted to start with asking you if you had, when you were getting started or even now, any role models among \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0oh my gosh", "\u2013 women or men \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0of course", "\u2013 who have gone from modeling to do other things", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i mean you certainly mentioned one \u2013 kathy ireland", "there\u2019s a long list", "cindy crawford, christy turlington, gisele \u2013 many women who are in the industry and have used their platform of voice or experiences to build businesses or to make meaningful impact in the world in whatever way they\u2019re passionate about, and like, for me, that is success, and, i don\u2019t know, yeah, i did not anticipate working in fashion or being a model, but i recognized somewhere along the line that there\u2019s so much more you can do with it, and the women who have come before me certainly have proved that", "it seems like, from the outside looking in, that much like, say, entertainment, the machinery of fashion, beauty, and so on probably has a lot of casualties", "meaning it just chews up \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "\u2013 and spits out a lot of people", "there\u2019s really high \u2013 it would seem to be \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of turnover", "a lot of turnover", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "what were some of the key decisions that you and/or your family or people like managers made that helped you to navigate \u2013 to avoid some of the most common pitfalls", "maybe you could just \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah, of course", "\u2013 start with like what are some of the most common mistakes and pitfalls", "karlie kloss:\u00a0sure", "i mean, honestly, tim, i feel like i\u2019m living my own version of a cinderella story or an american dream", "i mean i have been able to travel the world and have been able to learn from the most extraordinary people", "i\u2019m sititng here with you, talking", "i mean this is \u2013 i feel like i\u2019m living a dream every day", "and you know, i certainly did not anticipate going into fashion or being a model", "i had a very different kind of career path in mind, and i had this opportunity and i took it, but \u2013 what was the opportunity", "karlie kloss:\u00a0so, i was \u2013 now, you grew up in the midwest", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i grew up in the midwest and my father\u2019s a doctor", "he\u2019s an emergency room physician, one of the most hardworking people you\u2019ll ever meet and so selfless", "and i have three sisters, and my mom\u2019s an artist", "and so, i just like grew up in this amazing midwestern, picturesque kind of childhood", "and at 13, i was stopped in a mall and asked if i would be interested in walking in a fashion show", "at the time, not only did i not care about \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t my life, fashion", "i mean, i didn\u2019t even subscribe to magazines", "i was focusing school, i was focusing on ballet, academics, and sports", "and so, anyway, this idea of modeling was like totally not even in my mind", "and so, i didn\u2019t enter this with the ambition of building a career in modeling", "i was stopped in a mall at 13, walked in a local charity fashion show to raise money for a local family whose \u00ac\u2013 my friend\u2019s father, her dad had cancer, so it was this charity benefit, and there were scouts there from real agencies, and they took my name and said, \u201clet\u2019s stay in touch.\u201d i grew a couple inches, fast forward to when i\u2019m 15, and i \u2013 how tall are you at 15", "karlie kloss:\u00a0at 15", "oh my god, tim", "i was 15 years old and 5\u201911\u201d", "yeah", "karlie kloss:\u00a0it\u2019s painful being \u2013 i\u2019m still working on \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a015 years old", "5\u20199\u201d", "i\u2019m 40", "i\u2019m \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0look, it\u2019s \u2013 \u2013 gonna get there", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i believe in you", "i believe in you", "and so, anyway, i was 15 years old and i got this opportunity to go to new york for the weekend and meet the designers of calvin klein, and they booked me", "and i walked in their fashion show, and it completely kind of put me on the map as a new, up and coming model", "and it\u2019s been a wild ride ever since that day in the mall when i was stopped", "what are the traps", "like what are the common pitfalls", "i mean the things that, having grown up on long island, and for instance, i mean i grew up at the very end of long island, where there are actually a lot of drug problems", "and not saying that it\u2019s drugs, although i suspect that could be a piece of it, but like where do people get off track or make mistakes", "karlie kloss:\u00a0sure", "i mean, i think there\u2019s a lot of misconceptions, and i think there\u2019s a lot of generalizations around the fashion industry, around the modeling industry, and you know, i can only speak to my experience, but i\u2019ve had just a really positive experience as a model", "like i said, it\u2019 been my key to the world", "i\u2019ve been able to travel the world", "i have more frequent flier miles than most ceos, and i\u2019m \u2013 you know, i\u2019ve been able to see the world and learn so much, learn from so many brilliant people and so, you know, i\u2019ve used it to my advantage", "i think that there are aspects of the industry that are really challenging", "i think a lot of people tell you no", "there\u2019s a lot of competition", "like you said, i mean there\u2019s so many beautiful people", "there\u2019s a lot of luck", "and i feel like for me, you know, in my cinderella story, i feel like i was in the right place at the right time, and i had this window of opportunity, and i ran for it", "and i have an amazing family who was by my side every step of the way", "i mean, starting a career at 15, i think there\u2019s pitfalls to that, just the nature of being 15 and having a lot of pressure on you", "so, for me, i had a lot of luck and the right people around me", "and i think a lot of young women who want to go into modeling or work in fashion, that\u2019s not always the case", "how did your family help you in terms of rules and policies", "and the reason i ask this is it seemed like they were quite strict when it came to high school, homework, and so on", "so, i was doing some reading prior to this, and a day might look like a 7:00 a.m", "flight to new york to do some type of shoot for \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0right", "5:00 a.m", "flight", "5:00 a.m", "flight that would get international coverage, and then you fly back and you\u2019re doing homework at 7:00 p.m", "and so on", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "what were some of the parameters, rules, policies \u2013 anything like that that your parents had to help keep you on track", "because this relates to something that has popped up a few times in this podcast that i think\u2019s really important", "so, could you speak to that", "karlie kloss:\u00a0sure", "you know, i had this kind of double life", "i was 15 years old and very much figuring out who i am, what \u2013 you know, in high school, i mean you\u2019re figuring out a lot of things", "and like i said, i was a 5 foot 11\u201d 15-year-old, so that came with its own set of challenges", "but i don\u2019t know, i guess i \u2013 i had this double life, and i would be in school, have a very normal day in class, sitting in the school lunch room with my friends, with my peers, and then i would get on a flight to paris or new york a couple days a week", "i really had this full-time job, even as a freshman in high school", "so, i had this double life, and it was before social media, so none of my friends or teachers really knew to the extent of what i was doing", "so, i would go to paris and walk in a couture runway show or be the face of the dior campaigns globally or on the cover of magazines, and it was before the kind of global connectivity we have now, so i kind of was able to have a very, very normal, real life at the same time i was building this international career", "and i think the discipline that \u2013 to my parents, definitely helped me kind of stay really balanced with focusing on academics and focusing on what matters", "i mean we still would have normal family dinners, and i would get in trouble if i didn\u2019t \u2013 you know, came home past curfew or \u2013 i don\u2019t know, i had such a normal home life that i think that really was \u2013 that balanced all of these amazing other things out", "and i think my parents were always really \u2013 they trusted me", "i think that\u2019s one of the biggest things too", "they knew that i was \u2013 they trusted me to do the right thing", "and that freedom \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of, i don\u2019t know, responsibility i felt with that, and gratitude to my parents because i didn\u2019t want to let them down", "and so, i think i never wanted to \u2013 i don\u2019t know \u2013 to ruin that", "sort of betray that confidence", "karlie kloss:\u00a0betray that", "yeah", "so, one of the reasons i ask is i\u2019m fascinated by people who have reached a pinnacle of success in any field who can remain grounded in any capacity", "because it seems that, whether it\u2019s alcohol, power, money \u2013 those are the three that come to mind \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0sure", "\u2013 when you add those, any of those, in quantity, people tend to become more of what they are", "right", "so, if they have a small flaw, it gets magnified", "and if they\u2019re a small asshole, they become a really big asshole, and there\u2019s real risk when pressure\u2019s added to the container", "so, i\u2019m fascinated how people maintain perspective over time so that they don\u2019t become some abomination, like frankenstein\u2019s version of themselves", "and, for instance, a friend of mine i\u2019ve had on this podcast, chris sacca, who i\u2019ve had the privilege of \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah, of course", "\u2013 watching go from angel investor to fledgling vc to now, you know, midas lists, and arguably \u2013 i don\u2019t even think it\u2019s arguable, is his lowercase i fund is, i think, going to be the most successful venture capital fund in the history of venture capital", "karlie kloss:\u00a0wow", "so, he\u2019s really reached a peak, and when i\u2019ve dug in with him as to how he\u2019s maintained some perspective, because he still ultimately is a very middle-class kid who grew up in upstate new york, trying to make ends meet", "his parents had him do sweet and sour summers", "so, they would help him to find a job that would give him an opportunity to learn and interact with people who were maybe above his pay grade, above his parents pay grade, but then they would also make him take some shitty job, like hauling around heavy things \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0oh, i had plenty of those", "\u2013 on a construction site", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i had plenty of those shitty jobs", "but you know, so i \u2013 to the extent of the normal life \u2013 this kind of double life that i had \u2013 my normal life, i really \u2013 i can\u2019t stress it enough", "it was very normal", "like i mean i still had my chores \u2013 doing the dishes, taking out the trash, like every 15-year-old", "didn\u2019t matter if i was on the cover of international vogues, like i was still coming home and doing my homework and taking out the trash", "and also, beyond just my parents, my sisters", "i have three sisters that i\u2019m really close with", "and some of my best friends \u2013 my core group of girlfriends from growing up that i\u2019ve known since kindergarten are still some of my best friends", "and so, i think there\u2019s this \u2013 i feel really grateful that i\u2019ve been able to, i don\u2019t know, keep my feet on the ground, very much so", "and also, i have a lot of people around me who would bat me over the head and like beat me up if i didn\u2019t, you know", "they wouldn\u2019t allow it", "i don\u2019t know", "yeah", "yeah, the support structures also \u2013 people might be asking \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0i lived in the midwest", "\u2013 themselves, like, \u201cwell, okay, you grew up that way", "fantastic", "i didn\u2019t grow up that way, so it\u2019s not actionable.\u201d and then what i would say is, \u201cnot true.\u201d why would i explore this", "it\u2019s because you can actually build in \u2013 it\u2019s like, all right, what is the version, if you are hoping to achieve a certain modicum of success, like what are the chores that you can engineer into your life so that you maintain some perspective", "are there ways to do it", "right", "maybe it\u2019s volunteering once a week", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "and that helps you to not only, hopefully, ultimately achieve some success, but to achieve also some contentment and life outside of focusing only on your personal success, right", "which is actually a segue of sorts to \u2013 i\u2019m going to get there", "i\u2019m going to talk about coding very, very shortly, but i\u2019m going to get there vis-\u00e0-vie books", "so, i want to ask about books", "because i had read \u2013 maybe true, maybe not \u2013 that you don\u2019t actually watch very much television", "and so, i was like, all right, great, well, let\u2019s talk about books, then", "are there any particular books that you have gifted the most to other people or reread often yourself", "karlie kloss:\u00a0so, i love podcasts, and i love audiobooks", "i feel like i\u2019m somebody who learns by listening", "i retain information better", "so, i do like tv, but i just don\u2019t have a ton of time for it", "i feel like i\u2019m constantly on the go and so i\u2019m listening to audiobooks, whether i\u2019m walking through airport security or in a cab to the airport", "and i love \u2013 there\u2019s this book, the four agreements, that i recently gave my sisters, who are graduating from college", "and i just think it\u2019s got a lot of great principles and ideas", "are there any particular podcasts that are your go-to", "karlie kloss:\u00a0so, i love learning about things", "i love learning about entrepreneurs, i like learning about \u2013 i love listening to conversations", "i mean i guess that\u2019s one thing too that i feel like in my real life, i get to ask people", "i am sitting here with you, tim", "i mean, what a privilege that is, the access that i have", "you\u2019re welcome to rescind that comment later", "karlie kloss:\u00a0no, it\u2019s true", "it\u2019s true", "but i love listening to conversations", "i love your work", "i love guy, how i built this", "i love listening to conversations", "so, the four agreements, just for people who aren\u2019t familiar, has come up quite a few times in this podcast, and i also recently found out that tom brady had been gifting this book a whole lot as well", "it has to \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0that\u2019s good company to be in", "\u2013 catch you at the right time, i think, for it to be applicable, but the reason i brought up \u2013 you were going to say", "karlie kloss:\u00a0no, i was just going to say, you know, i\u2019m 25, and i feel like it\u2019s to the point of the timing \u2013 because someone gave it to me for my birthday, and i just think that it really does come down to kind of this \u2013 i think we\u2019re always evolving, always growing, and should be always learning, at least i hope i am", "and it really makes you focus inward, and i think there\u2019s \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter how old or young you are, i think that\u2019s something that i really value, is growing as a human being", "and it certainly kind of helps you think about ways to grow and to focus as a human being", "so, other ways to grow", "we\u2019re going to get to it in two seconds", "i brought up books because books involve writing, sort of expressing thought, in some cases on paper, some cases in audio", "and there\u2019s a craft, there\u2019s a certain elegance to good writing", "and i have been fascinated by coding and coders for a very long time, and the fact that you can have, say, a very, very good coder get more done than the next ten if he or she is just very, very elegant and can find non-obvious solutions in what they\u2019re trying to execute", "and i\u2019ve spent a very small amount of time with a guy named chad fowler, actually, who showed me many years ago the basics of ruby", "it was just in one afternoon, but he used natural language to help me get a grasp on it because he speaks hindi and i\u2019m fascinated by different languages and was an east asian studies major, so i\u2019m fascinated by writing systems in japanese, chinese, korean, etc", "and so, i wanted to ask you, of all the many, many things, of the hundreds and thousands of things that you could do with your time, how did you get exposed to coding", "and walk me through your first experience or experiences with that", "karlie kloss:\u00a0well, i love the way that you explain it as a language, and that\u2019s really what it is", "and i think that, like any language, it\u2019s a medium that you can express yourself, that you can express creative ideas, and that is why i think it\u2019s so powerful", "i got exposed to it because i\u2019m just a super curious, like annoyingly curious person", "i ask a lot of questions, and i love understanding how things work", "i love understanding how the world around me works and how science and math can be ways to explain that", "but i work in a really creative industry, and, i don\u2019t know, i guess, at a certain point, a couple of years ago, i wanted to understand what \u201ccode\u201d was", "it was a term that i kept hearing \u2013 what prompted it", "was it a person, a conversation", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah, i mean i was meeting a lot of entrepreneurs", "i was watching the entire world, especially fashion and media be transformed by technology, and i was like, what is it that a handful of people who are engineers and building huge enterprise value \u2013 what is the secret language that they know that the rest of us don\u2019t, and code", "and i was like, what is code, and how can i learn it", "so, i took a boot camp", "i took one week, and even in \u2013 where was it", "karlie kloss:\u00a0in new york, at the flatiron school", "who introduced you to that", "karlie kloss:\u00a0this guy, avi flombaum", "and he is a great teacher, and he started this school, and he taught me ruby, exactly as you", "so, it\u2019s a very intuitive kind of language", "and even in a short time, i was able to kind of understand high-level, big principles, and the fact that you can use code to, you know, write a line of code that performs a function, and you can build ideas using this language", "and that to me was just so mind blowing to understand how the tech that we touch every day \u2013 how it works, and to take it one step further, but to actually be able to write it yourself and to express your ideas, and to be able to \u2013 i mean you\u2019re a man of \u2013 you\u2019re so efficient, tim, it\u2019s really inspiring", "you\u2019re so organized and so efficient", "i\u2019m organized for maybe like two hours a day, so you\u2019re seeing my two hours", "karlie kloss:\u00a0no", "you are", "it\u2019s impressive", "and i just think that like even you can build tech to enable that and to scale that", "and that\u2019s what\u2019s so powerful, is the ability to scale ideas or scale problem solving using code", "and i think that there\u2019s so much opportunity that has yet to really even be built in this kind of intersection of \u2013 many intersections of kind of creative industries from the perspective of someone writing code who has different life experiences or passions, maybe, than most engineers sitting in silicon valley today", "and you take this class, you learn the basics of ruby with avi", "karlie kloss:\u00a0with avi", "alright", "and what is kode with klossy", "karlie kloss:\u00a0so, kode with klossy is \u2013 it\u2019s a \u201ck,\u201d folks", "karlie kloss:\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s with a \u201ck\u201d \u2013 k-o-d-e", "karlie kloss:\u00a0\u2013 is my organization where we teach girls to learn how to code and empower the next generation of tech leaders", "so, we do that by running summer camps across the country, and we teach girls the abcs \u2013 so ruby, html, javascript, css \u2013 enough to be able to build something", "so, our camps are across the country and they\u2019re two weeks long, and they\u2019re totally free", "and we have these amazing girls who come into our camps and learn these skills, and it\u2019s amazing what they\u2019re able to build", "and not only just the way that they\u2019re able to build their ideas, but what they\u2019re passionate about \u2013 so, if it\u2019s like making social impact, helping their community \u2013 they\u2019re able to build something and recognize the impact that they can have", "and that\u2019s really empowering", "and that, for a girl who\u2019s kind of, you know, at that point in life where you\u2019re figuring out what you think you can be or what you think you can\u2019t, that\u2019s really empowering", "hmm", "i need to learn to code", "karlie kloss:\u00a0you need to \u2013 i feel like you \u2013 i need to learn to code", "karlie kloss:\u00a0\u2013 you need to come to our camp", "it\u2019s embarrassing that i\u2019ve been in silicon valley, or \u2013 i mean, i\u2019m no longer there", "we\u2019re in austin, and i live here, but 17 years in silicon valley, and i think i was too \u2013 i was worried that i wouldn\u2019t be good at it", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i felt the same way", "i had a deep insecurity that when i scratched the surface, i would see the infinite complexity of something that i could at best only be mediocre at", "and so, i stuck my head in the sand", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i disagree", "i think that that\u2019s one of the barriers to entry", "i think that\u2019s why a lot of people don\u2019t ever try", "i mean, who am i", "i don\u2019t have a \u2013 i don\u2019t work in silicon valley", "i didn\u2019t go to college", "but i\u2019m curious, and it\u2019s something that can be learned, like anything else", "it is a language, and i think that a lot of people let that get in the way of taking that first step", "yeah, you know, it strikes me too that, i think perhaps in my mind, i\u2019ve given myself an out which is actually really flimsy, and that is that it\u2019ll be too hard to learn to code", "in my mind, learning to code is building, you know, the next super app to go gain a hundred million users", "whereas in reality \u2013 i\u2019ll give you an example from my own experience", "then i have some questions for you so i don\u2019t talk too much", "this is what happens with too much caffeine, but \u2013 so, i\u2019ve always been very, very insecure about my voice", "karlie kloss:\u00a0oh, come on", "\u2013 and that\u2019s part of the reason why i wanted to do the podcast, is to beat that out of myself, or to get more comfortable with my voice", "and if anyone listens to my earlier episodes \u2013 say the introductions to my early, early, early episodes, and then later you will see the confidence build over time", "i was really unsure of myself in the beginning", "and i\u2019m still unsure of myself in some ways, but i\u2019ve always been fearful of singing, any type of singing", "karlie kloss:\u00a0[inaudible]", "i would never do it", "karlie kloss:\u00a0look, i\u2019m right there with you", "so, i\u2019ve always had, on my new year\u2019s resolutions almost every year for the last six years \u2013 along those lines \u2013 voice lessons", "never did it until a few months ago", "just started", "and what i realized very quickly is that i don\u2019t have to become a good singer to get a credible value out of these voice lessons", "because i\u2019ve learned enough now \u2013 i\u2019ve certainly improved, but i\u2019m not ready for any opera \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0i think this might be your debut", "we will see", "karlie kloss:\u00a0after the podcast", "after the podcast", "but yeah, i won\u2019t impose that on anyone right now", "it will be very, very harsh", "but when you learn the basics of any skill \u2013 and i already know this, so i don\u2019t know why i\u2019ve been so blind to it with both singing and i think now coding \u2013 even if you never do anything with it per se, suddenly you hear everything \u2013 in the case of voice, you listen to every song you hear differently", "and so, your enjoyment of that and your appreciation of it are ten-xed", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "and i would imagine that when you learn the basics of coding \u2013 even if you don\u2019t use it to push you off into a different career, it gives you an entirely different lens through which you can look at everything that is being built and how things work", "karlie kloss:\u00a0a thousand [inaudible] [00:32:46]", "and that alone, to have that gift, to look through a different lens through the rest of your life, putting in a week or two seems like a very potentially worthwhile use of time", "karlie kloss:\u00a0absolutely", "tim, i mean, just on that point, it\u2019s like, you know, i think even if you understand high level how things are built, you can understand what is possible", "and i think that that\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting, even just as an entrepreneur", "you don\u2019t have to \u2013 i mean, there\u2019s probably so many people that you\u2019ve sat with and that you met in silicon valley that \u2013 even a friend of mine, kevin systrom, founded instagram \u2013 or one of the cofounders of instagram", "and he wrote lines of code early on, and actually, i think that was one of the a-ha moments", "i knew him as a friend, and i was like, \u201cwait, kevin, you actually know how to code", "you actually built lines of code to build this tool, this platform that reaches so many people?\u201d it put a human element to it", "and i think the idea of even learning a little bit of what code is and how it builds things, it makes you realize what could be possible", "and i think, for people who want to build businesses, you don\u2019t have to be the main engineer, but there is this kind of literacy that i think is important", "yeah, i mean it certainly seems to be the new literacy \u2013 or one of the new forms of literacy that, over time, as \u201csoftware eats the world,\u201d to borrow marc andreessen\u2019s expression, if you don\u2019t want to be displaced, if you want to be able to compete, you need to at least understand the abcs", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "and easy for me to say with my platform and microphone as someone who\u2019s being a bit hypocritical, since i only did one afternoon of ruby with chad", "karlie kloss:\u00a0oh, until you come to my coding camp", "until i come to your camp", "karlie kloss:\u00a0but the other thing is too, tim, is that part of the reason why i wanted to take a class beyond just wanting to understand how the world was being transformed by technology and what specifically that meant, but it\u2019s like, because i was so intimidated by it, because i work in fashion, because i am not someone who maybe looks like the most \u2013 you know, most people in silicon valley or engineers, i don\u2019t know, i wanted \u2013 there\u2019s something in me, i think, that wanted to do what i think would be the harvest possible thing to do, or like \u2013 i don\u2019t know, and this was not even about building an organization and helping other people do the same thing", "this was just for me, selfishly", "i wanted to learn something really hard", "and i think that there\u2019s probably a part of me that\u2019s like, you know, insecure \u2013 speaking about the fact that i know that i\u2019m more than just what people see me on the outside", "and i think that insecurity probably has driven me to want to keep doing more", "and it just \u2013 i am just a really curious, passionate person, and i think this \u2013 i\u2019ve always been really interested in math and science, and i don\u2019t know, i think that that\u2019s partially why i tackled this challenge too, initially, was like, i want to learn what is going to be \u2013 what do people really think is hard to learn", "i want to learn it", "well, so, let\u2019s talk about challenge for a second \u2013 or more than a second", "and i don\u2019t know the attribution to this quote i really like, which is \u201ceverything you want is just outside of your comfort zone.\u201d and i\u2019m sometimes better at practicing that than others", "but i\u2019d love to talk about discomfort for a second", "karlie kloss:\u00a0sure", "because i think people have \u2013 there are many misconceptions about anyone who has a lot of public exposure, like yourself", "so, one might be, \u201cah, she\u2019s just a pretty face.\u201d right", "karlie kloss:\u00a0sure", "which is not true", "another might be, \u201coh, it\u2019s all come very easily", "it\u2019s all been very easy", "it\u2019s just been home runs from day one.\u201d so, what i\u2019d love to ask you is, could you tell us about \u2013 you can choose \u2013 we can talk about both \u2013 like a dark, slash, hard time, what prompted it, and how you came out of it, or a failure that, looking back, helped set the stage or teach you something that led to success later", "and the more specific, the better, because i want to humanize this a little bit for people who might feel like this is \u2013 that you\u2019re perfect", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i\u2019m far from perfect", "so far from perfect, it\u2019s like beyond, but for me, i think that there have been many failures along the way, but also i am a really \u2013 i am the toughest person on myself, and \u2013 yeah, let\u2019s talk about a specific one", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i mean there are so many moments i can just think about in my fashion career, you know, where i didn\u2019t quite \u2013 i mean it\u2019s funny how you define like a failure, or even like dark moments", "i have built my career over the past ten years of my life, and i was 15 years old when i started that, and i think there\u2019s just natural human growth that happens over those ten years that\u2019s really important, and no matter what you\u2019re doing, you need to take those failures and challenge yourself to make yourself grow from them and be better.\nand for me, i think because i live in a more public life \u2013 or aspects of my life are more public, those failures or dark periods of growing up, of coming into your own, of growing into your own body, like that\u2019s even more criticized or, you know, more people can see it", "and so, i think for me, i definitely \u2013 so many different periods of my life where like, you know, being in the profession that i\u2019m in, it\u2019s very focused on the outside and your body", "and as a teenage girl, growing into your body, i mean there are so many times i\u2019ve gone into a fitting where the clothes don\u2019t fit, and that just has made me feel so shitty about myself, and it\u2019s not necessarily my fault, it\u2019s not necessarily the clothes\u2019 fault, it\u2019s just shitty", "it makes you feel horrible \u2013 it\u2019s made me feel horrible about myself", "and i think there was kind of this point progressively through my career that i was like, i am so much more than just like my measurements or my body", "i have so many ideas", "i\u2019ve got so much drive", "i know that i have so much to give the world, and i really want to help other people, and i know that i\u2019m not necessarily doing that \u2013 or the extent of my self worth or value cannot be just on fitting the clothes or not", "and i think that there was like a real shift in me and just understanding \u2013 i don\u2019t know, understanding how and what to do to keep growing", "so, are there any particular, for instance, routines, habits, on a daily or weekly basis that help you to continue functioning at a high level", "or that just help you, that you like", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "like what are some specifics \u2013 my listeners always the specifics", "are there any particular \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0[inaudible]", "i love meditating", "you know, i think \u2013 okay", "how do you \u2013 how, when, how long do you practice meditating", "karlie kloss:\u00a0okay", "so, i\u2019m not as probably good or disciplined as many of your listeners out there, but whenever i can, to the point of \u2013 do you use an app, do you use \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0i use headspace", "i learned tm", "but i just do it whenever, wherever i can", "so, you know, this morning, getting ready, i wake up, stretch, breathe, put in, you know, ten minutes of headspace, go to the gym, or vice versa, work out and then meditate, and then start my day", "you know, i really have learned how important it is to take care of myself mentally as well as physically, because i think, you know, part of being in \u2013 just part of life is staying mentally healthy and balanced, and i think especially in an industry that there is so much volatility \u2013 i mean to the point of \u2013 models and turnover, there\u2019s a lot of failures, daily, of jobs you don\u2019t get or things that you\u2019re \u2013 i have been told that i\u2019m too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny, too this, too that, everything", "i mean it\u2019s like \u2013 and that is such a \u2013 if that doesn\u2019t mess with your head as a teenage girl growing up anyway, then i mean, come on", "so, again, for me, you know, having an amazing support group around me, having like really \u2013 my family, my friends \u2013 and then having outlets that fill my cup", "so, for me, investing in my learning, sincerely, is something i love", "i love learning new things", "i love learning from people", "i love experiencing new things", "and i love helping people, not for the sake of, like, any reason other than just i love sharing opportunities for other people to better themselves, their lives too", "well, let\u2019s talk about one outlet, slash, maybe stress release valve, which is the exercise", "right", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "tim ferriss:\u00a0so, what does a sample morning exercise routine look like", "karlie kloss:\u00a0totally", "very specifically, and how long does it take", "what exercises are you doing", "what are you using", "karlie kloss:\u00a0okay, so, i grew up playing every sport, doing ballet every day", "i grew up super, super active, and i live a really busy life today, and i\u2019m on a plane all the time", "i mean you know it\u2019s not easy to fit it in, but for me, i make sure that i fit in like a combination of cardio and a combination of strength training", "so, i feel best when i\u2019m strong, not skinny", "and i like \u2013 so, tell us about a recent workout", "karlie kloss:\u00a0so, this morning \u2013 woke up, meditated, and worked out for 45 minutes \u2013 all i had time for \u2013 and i \u2013 and did you have breakfast before you worked out", "karlie kloss:\u00a0after", "after", "okay", "karlie kloss:\u00a0after i worked out", "and a combination of running, biking, and some light weights", "and just, i kind of do whatever i can whenever i can", "so, if i\u2019m in the south of france on a photo shoot, i\u2019ll go for a run and a swim", "if i\u2019m here in austin, i\u2019ll go for a run across that cool bridge and, like, go tour around", "whatever\u2019s available", "karlie kloss:\u00a0whatever\u2019s available", "for strength training, if you had to pick only a handful of exercises that seem to get you the most bang for the buck, what would they be", "what comes to mind", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i hate burpees so much \u2013 i hate them so much, but \u2013 you hate them, but it\u2019s a love-hate", "is that \u2013 ", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i hate them \u2013 it\u2019s a love-hate", "because i just \u2013 i hate them so much that i just know they\u2019re probably good for me", "burpees, things that you can do anywhere, so like planking or exercises like things that i do in my hotel room, like if i don\u2019t have time to go down to the gym", "so, just simple things like sit-ups, push-ups, dips, all sorts of \u2013 portable", "karlie kloss:\u00a0\u2013 really \u2013 yeah, boring things like that", "yeah, i mean boring but effective", "i wanted to get into specifics because i\u2019m always curious, when i meet someone who travels as much as you do, it makes it very clear that the, \u201ci haven\u2019t been able to work out because i\u2019m traveling\u201d excuse is utter bullshit", "and i\u2019m always curious how people make do", "right", "so, i\u2019ve talked to triple h, otherwise known as paul levesque \u2013 fascinating guy, and he\u2019ll use a stationary bike for \u2013 or elliptical, for, say, even ten, 15 minutes when he first arrives anywhere after shifting time zones, and it seems to fix jet lag for him", "karlie kloss:\u00a0[inaudible]", "danzig, when they were traveling around touring, one of the very first things they would do is they would choose a hotel based on the gym that was available", "karlie kloss:\u00a0oh, a hundred percent", "and it\u2019s like, bruce lee would always travel with his running shoes because he knew no matter what if other things weren\u2019t available, he could run", "and it just goes on and on and on", "i travel with a number of different bands, as well as \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "an inflatable ball, and it\u2019s incredible what you can do, particularly if you learn calisthenic exercises like burpees or pistols, which are one-legged squats, you can get a brutal workout in your own hotel room", "or jocko willink, who\u2019s a retired navy seal commander, and he\u2019ll travel with \u2013 or he won\u2019t necessarily travel with, but if he wants to do pull-ups and he can\u2019t find a place to do pull-ups, he\u2019ll grab one of the towels from his room in the hotel and go find the parking structure, and throw it over a bar, and do pull-ups with the towels", "so, it\u2019s like there\u2019s \u2013 two observations that i make", "no", "1., there\u2019s always a way", "but secondly, the most \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0there\u2019s always a way", "[inaudible] that\u2019s right", "there\u2019s always a way, and in the highest functioning, seemingly busiest people i\u2019ve met almost all make a point to move on a daily basis in some fashion", "karlie kloss:\u00a0it\u2019s so important \u2013 for me, in my life, it\u2019s crucial", "forget even about how it makes you look, but how it makes you feel and just, for me, brain \u2013 mental, emotional balance, i think, and focus and clarity", "it\u2019s like, i can\u2019t start my day without doing something", "and to the point of whatever it is, you know, i, in my suitcase, always have my running shoes, always have bands, always have ankle weights, which is really funny when i\u2019m going through airport security and i\u2019ve got like two ankle weights that look like bombs, and you know \u2013 yeah", "yeah", "karlie kloss:\u00a0\u2013 they\u2019re like lead ankle weights, and i get stopped every time and get, you know, questioned", "ankle weights and podcast gear", "karlie kloss:\u00a0[inaudible]", "it\u2019s like, \u201coh, a bunch of batteries and cables.\u201d karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "\u201cyeah, we need to talk to you.\u201d karlie kloss:\u00a0we\u2019re high-risk travelers", "mr", "american history x", "for those of you who don\u2019t know, i\u2019m very, very bald and have sort of a wrestler-y look to me", "karlie kloss:\u00a0[inaudible]", "so, let\u2019s chat about investing", "and by investing, i mean investment of time, energy, maybe in a particular relationship \u2013 i\u2019m going to say you can\u2019t answer with your family", "all right", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "sure", "so, i\u2019m going to roll them out", "but what would you consider one of the best investments you\u2019ve ever made", "and that could be, for instance, amelia boone has been on the podcast \u2013 four-time world champion in obstacle course racing", "for her, at the time, she was and still is a lawyer, but it was the first $450.00 entry fee for the first, i think it was world\u2019s toughest mudder, which she ended up winning, which opened up this entirely new career, right", "doesn\u2019t have to be something like that, but \u2013 you know, in my case could potentially be the idea to put in the time to do a six-episode test for the podcast", "like, holy shit, you know", "was just supposed to be a side gig because i was too burned out writing books, now it turned into a whole thing", "what comes to mind for you when you think about some of the best investments of time, energy, money, or decisions", "karlie kloss:\u00a0so, a number of things", "one, the first pair of high heels that i ever owned were $20.00 high heels from target that i learned how to quote, unquote \u201cwalk,\u201d and those came in very handy when i started my fashion career", "and i, with my first paycheck ever, bought a red kitchenaid mixer that still sits on my counter to this day, and thousands of cookies have been made from that little mixer", "and i got the idea of starting a vegan cookie charity project from my passion for baking", "and that led on to a whole fun project", "and \u2013 take a few sentences just to explain what that is", "karlie kloss:\u00a0so, that\u2019s really just what it sounds like", "it\u2019s a charity project focused on donating school lunches to kids through selling cookies, which, i love to eat cookies, i love to make cookies, and i wanted to kind of have a bake sale of sorts, and so \u2013 do you have any partners in \u2013 ", "karlie kloss:\u00a0we partnered with momofuku milk bar, and \u2013 yeah, for those who don\u2019t know that, look it up", "karlie kloss:\u00a0look it up", "must visit when you\u2019re in new york", "and we made cookies, and we donated over a million school lunches from the sales of these cookies", "and that was just this kind of first project where it was really my idea and something that i built and used my voice to take an idea and actually bake a cookie and bake an impact into that product, and \u2013 so, we got the heels, which \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0we got the heels", "\u2013 i mean, if you can\u2019t walk in those, you\u2019re going to have issues as a female in fashion", "the kitchenaid mixer \u2013 so, kitchenaid, if you\u2019re listening, i\u2019m sure karlie has very reasonable endorsement rates, so you can reach out", "what else", "karlie kloss:\u00a0and investing in time", "you know, honestly, two things, one, i applied back to nyu because i love learning and i wanted to be back in an environment where i could keep growing and learning", "and that was at 20 years old", "that was after five years already of working full time", "and so, i invested back in being a student", "and that also led me to taking a coding class", "and that led me to starting kode with klossy", "and \u2013 what did you go in to learn", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i wanted to learn anything, everything", "i have so many things that i love \u2013 so, question", "i want to \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0because i know you\u2019re really a curious person, too, so i feel like \u2013 i am, but i want to dig into the motivation for one second", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "so, i have some friends, very, very smart, very accomplished, who either didn\u2019t ever go to college or dropped out of college", "and for some of them, going back and getting the diploma was just a \u2013 and this is not a bad motivation at all, but they had carried some type of like defensiveness and insecurity about having not gone to college and finished", "was that any piece of it", "karlie kloss:\u00a0a hundred percent", "i was planning on becoming a physician, a doctor, emergency room doctor \u2013 something like my dad, or go to business school, or go to some \u2013 i always planned on having a very \u2013 at least getting a college degree", "and so, i think there\u2019s an element of wanting to kind of keep learning more, keep doing more \u2013 not for the sake of getting the degree, but for the sake of being in an environment where i can keep expanding my horizons", "and i think the thing is \u2013 and i have that through my job, as well", "there are so many ways that i\u2019m able to learn just by traveling and meeting people", "and i feel like everybody has that", "it\u2019s not just \u2013 i mean, i am a unique situation", "i get to travel to crazy places, but i think just, it\u2019s kind of a mindset, a mentality, a perspective of just keeping your eyes and ears open", "do you have any favorite classes or professors besides the coding", "anything come to mind", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i took a feminism class at nyu, which was really fascinating for understanding the history of feminism, academic perspectives, the different waves of feminism \u2013 a lot of academic reading around the topic, beyond just kind of rah-rah, girl power", "alright", "so, you mentioned a number of things", "are there any purchases, say, in recent memory \u2013 this is one of my rapid-fire questions \u2013 i know it\u2019s a bit of an awkward transition from feminism, so i apologize to people for that \u2013 but are there any particular purchases that have had a very positive impact on your life", "ideally of the, say, less than a hundred or less than a thousand dollar variety", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i love journaling", "on airplanes, i sit for, you know \u2013 especially that flight back to st", "louis is only two hours, so it\u2019s like two hours of uninterrupted time", "and every airplane that i\u2019m sitting on, i always journal and brain dump ideas, grocery lists", "it\u2019s really pretty remarkable looking back at those journals and thinking how much of the things that i listed out of dreams and goals that i\u2019ve been able to tick off and accomplish, and i think that an investment of a journal, a great moleskine, certainly has been worthwhile, and really just something that i think is a great exercise", "and i really love actually, like i said, taking care of myself \u2013 my mind and body", "and so, i always have all these \u2013 in my suitcase, i\u2019ve got all these crazy supplements, like moon juice dust \u2013 they have like brain dust and beauty dust, and it\u2019s like crazy potions of like ashwagandha and things that \u2013 like i\u2019m a total sucker and believer that like \u2013 so, i travel with all these potions in my suitcase, along with my bands and ankle weights", "when you use the notebooks, what does a page look like, and how do you follow up", "so, what i\u2019m curious to know is how things make it from the page into reality, right", "do you go back and figure out what next steps are", "do you write down next steps in a particular way", "and people have so many different ways of approaching this", "i mean in my case, in my journal \u2013 i wish i had it right here, but i always make a little box in the bottom right-hand corner, and that\u2019s for next steps, based on anything on that page", "karlie kloss:\u00a0smart", "and so, every bottom right-hand corner has next steps", "and then i\u2019ll go through, and i\u2019ll be like, eh, alright, that was a stupid idea", "or like, eh, that\u2019s not for now, and i\u2019ll do a second pass and then highlight the kind of like dominoes that i think will topple as many other dominoes as possible", "but when you brain dump, or when you put these things on paper, walk us through what that looks like", "karlie kloss:\u00a0next steps", "yeah", "karlie kloss:\u00a0there\u2019s also this app that\u2019s called wunderlist that\u2019s great", "yeah", "karlie kloss:\u00a0and for actually having a more digital version of those lists", "and then also, things like slack are great too", "the notebook is more just like my real personal, kind of deepest, darkest thoughts, but and ideas and goals, and like, nobody\u2019s judging \u2013 hopefully \u2013 nobody\u2019s reading them", "but i think the organization \u2013 you know, i mean i love \u2013 this is the way your brain works", "i think my brain is not the most organized", "i have a lot of ideas, and i think it\u2019s actually taken a lot of discipline to kind of keep everything moving forward and to \u2013 i definitely think it\u2019s like going through those lists and following up with the people that i need to continue the conversation with, or \u2013 i\u2019ve got an amazing team", "i\u2019ve got a great partner who is helping me build kode with klossy, building all my businesses", "who is that", "karlie kloss:\u00a0her name\u2019s penni thow", "she\u2019s amazing", "and i feel like it\u2019s a really collaborative process \u2013 taking those lists and actually turning them into action is more working with my team to bring them to live", "one thing i\u2019ve noticed \u2013 and tell me if this is off-base or not, but in doing a lot of homework on you, putting together the dossier \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0uh-oh", "i know, first of all, i need to send cookies to your friend, the crazy \u2013 oh, the crazy bulgarian", "karlie kloss:\u00a0[inaudible]", "bulgarian", "oh my god", "crazy bulgarian, i know you\u2019re listening", "you\u2019re in lucky", "karlie kloss:\u00a0the crazy bulgarian", "you need some cookies", "don\u2019t forget me", "i could use some cookies too", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "done", "i\u2019ll say it\u2019s for my cheat day, but i might actually break that rule", "karlie kloss:\u00a0on it", "yeah, i have to be careful around cookies", "one of those \u2013 very little portion control when it comes to cookies \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0i hear you", "\u2013 it turns out", "but \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0i\u2019ll send you healthy ones", "also send me the unhealthy ones", "you can address them to somebody else, and then i\u2019ll just eat them anyway", "karlie kloss:\u00a0okay [inaudible]", "the pattern that seemed to pop up was \u2013 and i think this actually makes you a lot smarter than i am in some really deep ways, is when i go through my notebook and i write down what needs to be done next, like what do i need to do next, and it seems like, as i\u2019ve looked through a lot of your history, you are much better at doing one thing that\u2019s really important that i need to improve upon, and that is, not asking, \u201cwhat do i need to do next?\u201d necessarily, but \u201cwho do i need to talk to next?\u201d and whether it\u2019s kevin systrom, or say, casey neistat, who\u2019s also been on the podcast, really [inaudible] [00:58:39], i\u2019ve had a lot of trouble \u2013 it doesn\u2019t even occur to me to ask for help \u2013 not because i think i have all the answers, but i don\u2019t want to burden people with that \u2013 or there\u2019s some weird baggage that i carry, which is why amanda palmer, at one point, the musician, really, and her book has really helped me to learn how to ask for help", "but is that accurate", "am i \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0a hundred percent", "oh my gosh", "i mean, again, i am somebody who didn\u2019t get a college degree, a business school degree, and i\u2019m trying to build businesses and a nonprofit and scale that impact and grow my team and be a boss", "i mean there are so many things that i\u2019m learning as i go", "and i think that what i really value is the people that i can lean on as mentors or advisors in figuring it out", "and i think that that\u2019s a really important thing that i also kind of had this awakening where i was like, i am in the room with extraordinary people and i\u2019m being afforded that opportunity because of my job, my day job \u2013 being a model, working on big advertising jobs, working in an industry with a lot of creatives", "how can i actually best use that to accomplish what i really dream of, what my biggest goals and ambitions are", "and i think a lot of people sometimes are afraid to ask for help, and i definitely have \u2013 i ask questions \u2013 you ask for help", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i ask for help", "yeah", "yeah, i don\u2019t know what my problem is with that", "i mean i\u2019ve gotten better, but it\u2019s one of these self-defeating habits of isolating myself that is kind of a \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0i do that too", "it\u2019s a default that i need to continually work on", "i get better for periods, and then i\u2019m like, oh, no, i need to figure this out", "i should be able to figure this out", "and like, sit down with my notebook, not always the ideal tool of choice", "so, i need to revisit", "amanda, i need your help", "i\u2019ll reread your book", "if you look at the last handful of years, are there any particular habits, beliefs, tools that have had a tremendously positive impact on your life besides things we\u2019ve mentioned already", "so, it can\u2019t be, say, meditation or headspace or one of those", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah", "you know, i think just learning by doing", "you know, over the past years, i find it so interesting to just see how much the whole world has changed in so many ways", "you know, you mentioned casey neistat", "i had a conversation with him a number of years ago, where i \u2013 if you want to talk about busy \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0yeah, talk about busy", "talk about wake up at \u2013 \u2013 look up casey neistat", "karlie kloss:\u00a0he\u2019s amazing", "and he really helped me realize that i could not just be a canvas for creators, but i could be a creator myself", "and i think there was kind of this overall shift in, certainly in fashion, in social media, enabling a platform and a voice for everyone", "doesn\u2019t matter if you are the model, your voice can be heard in the same way the brand or designers can", "and that extends for everyone, and that\u2019s beyond just fashion", "but there was this kind of shift in my own perspective of realizing that my ideas had value, and that i could be a creator and share what i was experiencing and learning and doing beyond just what was translated by somebody else or \u2013 i could be heard", "i could be \u2013 what am i saying", "i didn\u2019t have to just be seen but i could also be heard", "and i think that there was something really empowering in that, and that\u2019s been kind of a collective shift over the years", "and i think this kind of democratization of ideas and of voices and this kind of, instead of just a handful of people in power at the top, like everybody has the opportunity to build something with their ideas, and that\u2019s to the point of code being this ability to actually actualize that, to realize that", "to have ideas that, whether it\u2019s a problem you\u2019re facing or an idea for a company or an idea for making impact, i mean being able to actually build that, even if you\u2019re a 15-year-old girl", "i just, i think that there\u2019s something so exciting about there being no rules", "and i feel like a lot of the rules that maybe existed in the world or the industry that i work in ten years ago are no longer the case", "and i think it\u2019s exciting to see what is ahead of us", "that\u2019s exciting", "yeah, i mean, there\u2019s certainly still top-down power, and there are \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0sure", "\u2013 certain things that require political relationships and so on, but more and more so, the ability to develop bottoms-up power is available to anyone who is willing to learn and compete", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "that\u2019s the good news", "the bad news, potentially, is you better fucking compete, because \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0 yeah", "\u2013 guess what", "when there are, say, three to four billion additional people coming online in the next handful of years, you have to compete against everybody", "and i think that\u2019s a very good thing", "but it also means you can learn from everybody \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "\u2013 and that information is available", "so, just a few more questions", "billboard \u2013 you\u2019ve probably heard this question before because i like to ask it \u2013 but if you could put a few words, a word, a quote, anything on a billboard \u2013 can\u2019t be an advertisement \u2013 to get a message out to millions or billions of people, metaphorically speaking, what might you put on that billboard", "karlie: hmm", "i feel like that\u2019s \u2013 there are so many things that i probably should be putting on that billboard, but one thing that my dad always used to really hammer home to me and my sisters is \u2013 we would come home from school and if one of us got a bad grade or something, he would say, like, \u201cdid you give it your best?\u201d like only you actually really know", "did you give it your best", "did you study the best you could", "did you go in there as focused as possible", "did you give it your best", "and i think that there\u2019s something really important to always just keep in mind, is give it your absolute best", "and also be present", "i think that\u2019s the other thing, too", "those are two things that i always kind of think about to myself, like am i doing my absolute best", "yes", "then cut myself a break", "i can\u2019t compare myself to anyone else, because my best \u2013 only i know what that actually is", "and i think being present is a really important exercise, always", "did you give it your best", "that\u2019s a really important question", "yeah", "i feel like you are giving it your best, at least from the outside looking in", "karlie kloss:\u00a0definitely trying the best i can", "yeah", "karlie kloss:\u00a0i mean i certainly don\u2019t have all the answers", "i think that\u2019s one thing too, is i\u2019m 25 years old and like all of my \u2013 i\u2019m far from perfect, but i\u2019ve sincerely just given it my best every step of the way and taken opportunities that i\u2019ve been able to have and make the most of them, learn from them, keep growing \u2013 never kind of being satisfied or staying complacent, and then also thinking about how i can help others along the way", "so, you have a very exciting year ahead of you, as i\u2019m sure will be many, many years of excitement ahead of you", "karlie kloss:\u00a0thank you", "i\u2019m always super eager to support anything related to enabling through education", "i mean that\u2019s been a real focus of mine with a number of different organizations over the last ten years or so", "what closing comments might you have and ask of the audience, a suggestion to the audience certainly, if they can learn more about how to code or share that with girls or people who may want to attend one of your camps", "what would you like to share, ask of, or recommend to the audience", "karlie kloss:\u00a0well, you have an incredible audience and anyone out there listening, i ask, just, if you know any young women between the ages of 13 and 18 who you think would benefit from learning to code or would be interested, send them to kodewithklossy.com to apply for our free camps", "we\u2019re going to have a thousand spots", "this is a really, really big summer of growth for us \u2013 how long are the camps", "karlie kloss:\u00a0the camps are two weeks long, 9:00 to 5:00, monday through friday, and they are action packed", "there is so much that the girls do over the course of these two weeks", "and we are growing to 50 camps in 25 cities across the country, so it\u2019s a big summer for us, and we want to get as many amazing young women in these classes and in these camps, so send them to kodewithklossy.com to apply", "kodewithklossy.com", "k-o-d-e with \u2013 hopefully you guys can spell that \u2013 k-l-o-s-s-y.com", "what was the age range again", "karlie kloss:\u00a013 to 18", "13 to 18", "so, think about this for a second, folks", "you may say, \u201ci don\u2019t know any 13 to 18-year-old girls.\u201d alright", "do you have any daughters", "do your friends have any daughters", "are you a teacher with female students who might benefit from this", "consider it", "this is, in many, many respects the new literacy", "and i\u2019m going to get off my lazy ass and stop procrastinating \u2013 karlie kloss:\u00a0and come to my coding camp", "\u2013 and actually give it a shot", "karlie kloss:\u00a0yes", "yeah, talk about where\u2019s waldo", "that\u2019d be easy to pick out", "\u201cwho\u2019s the bald, shiny gnome among the 12 to 18-year old girls?\u201d karlie kloss:\u00a0no, no, no", "\u201coh, why is tim ferris here?\u201d karlie kloss:\u00a0you\u2019re the only boy
