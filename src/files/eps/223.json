Ferriss: Hello, boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where I dig into the details of world-class performance and attempt in each interview to tease out the thought systems, beliefs, habits, lessons learned, from people of all walks of life, to give you small little things, or very big things that you can test yourself. In this episode, we have Krista Tippett, who\u2019s been requested many times. @KristaTippett, K-R-I-S-T-A, Tippett, two Ps, two Ts. Krista Tippett is a Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and New York Times bestselling author. She created and hosts the very well-known public radio program and podcast On Being and curates the Civil Conversations Project, an emergent approach to the differences of our age. She received the 2013 National Humanities medal from President Barack Obama at the White House for \u201cthoughtfully delving into the mysteries of human existence. On the air and in print, Ms. Tippett avoids easy answers, embracing complexity and inviting people of every background to join her conversation about faith, ethics, and moral wisdom.\u201d Krista was a journalist and diplomat in Cold War Berlin and holds a Master\u2019s in Divinity from Yale University. Her books include Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living, Einstein\u2019s God: Conversations About Science and the Human Spirit, and Speaking of Faith: Why Religion Matters and How to Talk About It. We cover a lot in this conversation, including Krista\u2019s morning routines, Zen versus striving \u2013 are they compatible, incompatible, something else \u2013 defining the words \u201cspiritual\u201d and \u201cwise,\u201d the role of prayer for her \u2013 in which she focuses on overcoming depression \u2013 and the skills of good interviewing. There\u2019s much more to it, but I will leave my intro at that. And without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Krista Tippett. Krista, welcome to the show. Krista Tippett: I\u2019m glad to be with you. Tim Ferriss: I have, I suppose like many people, heard your voice quite a lot. I\u2019ve read your words quite a lot and I thought we might start with one of my favorite sentences of yours. It is \u201cAnger is often what pain looks like when it shows itself in public.\u201d This has been a mantra of sorts that I\u2019ve adopted to help me sustain the battle-weary feeling I get on the internet at times. Could you explain the context of that quote? Krista Tippett: Well, I guess the context of that quote or how I walk around with that thought is it\u2019s such an important context and piece of perspective to dealing with the level of emotion in our public life right now. It\u2019s in politics, but it\u2019s really everywhere. We take things at face value that we would be wiser to not take at face value. We would be wiser to be taking more breaths and understanding that things are true of other people that are also true of us that when we\u2019re upset, often the thing we say and do is really a deflection of what we\u2019re actually upset about or how we\u2019re upset. In terms of our public life right now, this way we have of reacting to each other\u2019s surfaces is getting in the way, among other things, it\u2019s getting in the way of us grappling with all the very real things we need to grapple with that actually are of our shared interest and have to do with our common wellbeing. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. It\u2019s seemed to me also that anger is often what fear sometimes looks like when it shows itself in public. I\u2019ve heard you say before that your father was fearful. I was hoping you might elaborate on that and in doing so, just give us some context for your childhood. Krista Tippett: Yes, and maybe that\u2019s part of the reason I have a sensitivity to this, because I think my father had a terrible first three years of his life, which we didn\u2019t know then but we know now is so completely formative in terms of how people handle the rest of their lives. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened to him, I think he was possibly abused. It was possibly violent. At best, it was severely neglectful. My father was this kind of larger-than-life character. That\u2019s how he presented. And, of course, he was my father so he was this huge, powerful character, but I think even from a very young age, I sensed that underneath he was very frightened. Yeah, I hadn\u2019t actually thought recently about how that may be helping me imagine that inside the political dynamics in America right now. Tim Ferriss: Where did you grow up? Krista Tippett: I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a good wrestling state, that much I know. Krista Tippett: Really? The only sport I knew growing up was football. I was the only person I knew who was against football. Tim Ferriss: Against football? I can\u2019t say I\u2019m against wrestling because that was the only sport I could be half-competent at growing up, so I idolized John Smith, who is just this incredible savant/super-human athlete in the world of wrestling from Oklahoma, who then turned into an amazing coach. Why were you against football? Krista Tippett: I don\u2019t know that I was always against football. I just felt like it got too much attention and then when I got older, I had this enlightened moment in high school, were I was a debater. I did drama and debate. That\u2019s what actually kept my brain alive growing up. I found out that the high school football team had a $50,000.00 budget, which included steak dinners for all the players after every game. This was one of my first introductions to injustice in the world. I protested that and it absolutely colored by view of football. That was a lot of money. I mean, that\u2019s a lot of money now. It was a huge amount of money in 1960s, \u201870s. Tim Ferriss: It is a lot of money. It\u2019s a money machine, as a lot of people know. You mentioned drama and debate and I know that there have been a lot of formative moments, as for all people in your childhood and throughout high school and college, but looking back, do you think drama and debate were good training for what you do now? Or was it really just a manifestation of what you were already good at? Krista Tippett: No, it\u2019s so interesting to get to be in yours 50s. I have to say, when I turned 50, I found that \u2013 I\u2019d never cared about birthdays and basically have found every decade to be more interesting than the last \u2013 but this one I didn\u2019t like. I didn\u2019t like the number 50. I didn\u2019t like crossing it. But now that I\u2019m in it, you have certain perspective on your life and I do feel, not that I ever would have planned or foreseen what I do now. Until even a few years before I did it, but it does feel like it pulls on all these threads, all these many things that I did in my life. What\u2019s interesting to me is that it actually does pull on that drama piece. You know, I went away to college, I never did that again. Late in life, in what turns out to be, I guess, my big career. There\u2019s a presentational piece to it, so I\u2019m really grateful for that. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned college. I have a lot of friends, many of my closest friends went to Brown and I\u2019ve heard you describe it as moving to Mars? Krista Tippett: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Now, the question that I\u2019d like to pose is if I was to talk to your closest friends and ask them what your super powers are, how would they answer that? Krista Tippett: My closest friends in college? Tim Ferriss: No, your closest friends now, or in college. Because the follow-up question is, were those super powers present in college? Krista Tippett: Oh, gosh. It\u2019s such an interesting question. I did feel like I had moved from one planet, which was my small town in Oklahoma, Bible belt, to this very different world. I\u2019ll tell you something interesting. I ended up spending most of my 20s in divided Berlin. After the wall fell, I got my Stasi files. The German Secret Service, the Stasi, had kept files on me from the time that I went to East Germany on a Brown exchange program my junior year, which included reports on me from East German students who came to Brown through that same exchange program, and then later in the years I spent in Berlin. It\u2019s so fascinating. It\u2019s like this malevolent observer, malevolent however, kept folders of me in my 20s. So in my Stasi file are all the letters I wrote home to my parents from my semester abroad, all the letters my parents wrote to me, the letters back and forth between me and my boyfriend, and also the observations of these East German graduate students about me at college. It\u2019s so fascinating. One day when I\u2019m no longer doing this radio show, I will write this book. Tim Ferriss: What were some of their observations? Krista Tippett: Well, it\u2019s suffused with paranoia because they always assumed that I was working for the CIA, which is just so ridiculous because 19-year-old college sophomores don\u2019t work for the CIA. So it was like observing me through this lens of paranoia. They saw me as so competent in a way that I think I didn\u2019t see myself. One came to Brown after knowing me in East Germany, where I was just so much in learning mode and soaking-everything-up mode. I guess that would be one of my super powers, that if I get curious, if I give myself over to an experience, I really give myself over to it and I guess I\u2019m a good learner. So that was the way they had experienced me full-time that semester I spent there. Then this woman came to Brown and she said to her I was like a different person. She said, \u201cShe knows everyone,\u201d which I never thought of myself. I never thought of myself as someone who knew everyone. She saw me as very outgoing and gregarious and a strong personality. I don\u2019t know. I look back at my college self, I look back at myself in my 20s, like many of us, I think, and I only remember all the self-doubt and the confusion. Tim Ferriss: What do you think the principles of good learning are? By all accounts, and certainly my impression is that you are a fantastic learner. What do you think the principles of elements of being a good learner are? Krista Tippett: I guess two things come to mind. One is good questions. What I would also say about that is I think learning is a process, so even if it\u2019s something I\u2019m spending an hour learning about, I\u2019m going to expect that my questions are more refined at the end of that hour than they are at the beginning of that hour. So it\u2019s being able to formulate good questions going in, but then not just letting your answers or what your understanding be shaped, but letting your questions evolve. That your questions get better and better. I guess the other thing about learning, I think, is it kind of gets back to where you and I started about seeing what looks like anger. Seeing what is expressing itself as anger, but understanding that there\u2019s something very more \u2013 being interested and open to knowing that there\u2019s something more complicated and perhaps something quite other, deeper, than what is showing itself on the surface. That\u2019s a quality of learning that is pushing for that deeper thing, that what\u2019s beneath the surface. Tim Ferriss: I have always been \u2013 and this is not a good thing \u2013 quick to anger. I could point to family influences, I could point to all sorts of things to absolve myself of responsibility, but it\u2019s been, in some respects, an aid, a level of aggression, but it\u2019s also been very damaging. I remember being told a few years ago, and I don\u2019t recall who gave me this advice, but said \u201cDo not ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence.\u201d I\u2019ve since realized that incompetence can be replaced with a lot of things. Busy \u2013 they might just be busy. Just because they gave you a one-line email response to your mini-novella that you sent them doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re spiteful or angry. Maybe they just have ten times more stuff on their plate than you do. If anger is the emotion that I historically have been quick to, that I\u2019m trying to learn to work with in a more constructive way, what emotion are you quick to? Krista Tippett: Well, I have to say that I\u2019m a redhead and I also am \u2013 well, I\u2019m going to say this kind of proudly, I don\u2019t act out the way I used to. But people who\u2019ve known me in other parts of my life would certainly say that I had a huge temper. I do righteous indignation really well. I do it less often than I used to. Tim Ferriss: So Brown was just like jet fuel on the fire. My cousin went to Brown, I have so many friends who\u2019ve gone to Brown. I think I probably would\u2019ve been happier there than Princeton, quite frankly. Yeah, righteous indignation. That\u2019s a full-time \u2013 [Crosstalk] Krista Tippett: Yeah, I\u2019m good at that. I think one thing about having children that kind of gets to what you\u2019re talking about is you see how children, if you \u2013 and I think this is interesting because I\u2019ve read your books across the years. If they haven\u2019t eaten enough or they\u2019re not eating the right things, if they haven\u2019t gotten enough sleep, they get cranky. They\u2019re miserable. And it\u2019s all out on the surface. So much of our bad behavior or the behavior that we look back later and say, oh, I wish I hadn\u2019t done that, it\u2019s also about just these elemental things about being creatures in bodies and being tired and being hungry and not taking care of ourselves. Sometimes we are, a lot of us, we\u2019re tired, we\u2019re stressed out. But somehow, as we go through life, we get less good at wearing that on the surface and sometimes saying that and stepping back, rather than giving into the fit that might be another way to work out our stress or our tiredness. Tim Ferriss: This reminds me of an anecdote that was shared with me a few months back, which was that Bill Clinton, President Clinton at the time, when he was having a meeting that would lead to some type of negotiation, the first thing he would do when people came in is ask them if they\u2019d had anything to eat or drink and make sure that they were not thirsty and not hungry before the negotiation. For myself, at least, I\u2019ve realized, and I would like to talk about some of the depressive periods that you\u2019ve worked through because that is something that I\u2019ve \u2013 I hate to use the word \u201csuffered\u201d from because it makes it seem, I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m victimizing myself or playing the part of the victim \u2013 but something I\u2019ve learned I have to work with. I\u2019ve noticed that very often when I\u2019m trying to sit down and think my way out of some type of funk and I\u2019m coming up with all sorts of sophisticated or seemingly insightful reasons as to why I\u2019m unhappy at the time or just in a low-energy state, the truth is staring me right in the face. No, you haven\u2019t eaten for five hours. I\u2019ll sit there and I\u2019ll journal for ten pages and it\u2019s like, no, idiot, you just need to go have an orange and you\u2019ll be fine. For yourself, and I know you\u2019ve spoken about this before and written about it, but going through depressions \u2013 and let\u2019s say, I think it was a few years ago that you went through depression \u2013 can you identify or explain for people what triggered or catalyzed that and then what helped you to get over that episode of depression? Krista Tippett: I think I probably had my first episode of true depression when I was a sophomore in college. But nobody had that vocabulary back then. I used the language with myself that I\u2019d fallen into a black hole. The way it felt and the way it still looks to me like now, I almost visualize it, is that I clawed my way out of that black hole. In fact, it was a formative experience that I emerged with a lot of courage and a lot of determination and I set a plan for my life, which included how much sleep I needed every night. I look back and I think, wow, that was very intelligent because those are the kinds of things that matter. But also I think that I would say at this point that I know that I think I come by this honestly. I think my father was depressed, although that never showed on the surface. I also started at Brown, I had never really exercised. It\u2019s crazy because I\u2019m not that old, but the culture I grew up in, girls didn\u2019t do sports really. I mean, there were girls who did, but they were unusual. So I\u2019d never really used my body in that way. But I started this very faithful practice. I swam. Everywhere I was in the world for 25 years, and I was a few places in those years. I swam at least every other day. Looking back, I think that was a form of self-care. Actually, that summer before this major depression set in, I had stopped swimming. I was doing something else. I was rollerblading. But that was a little bit different. So I changed that. But I think the big answer is that I had \u2013 I was in my early 30s. I\u2019d literally led a few lives at that point. I\u2019d put myself through all this change. I was always very hard on myself, which got me a long way. But it was much too hard to be me and I had this career in Berlin, being a journalist and being a diplomat and then I\u2019d taken myself away to write a novel, and then I\u2019d gotten married, and I\u2019d lived in England, and then gone to divinity school, and then had a baby and moved to Minnesota. Honestly, I think this depression had been waiting a long time to happen. As is often true of us in life, I think at the moment at which I was kind of settled enough to allow it to happen, it just took over. I had just started to see a therapist. I\u2019d always thought of myself as somebody who\u2019d had a happy childhood and would never see a therapist and didn\u2019t need that. But somewhere in myself I think I got ready for this. That was really a depression where I stopped being able to sleep at all and all the classic things \u2013 lost 15 pounds for no reason. Eventually, I just went to bed and didn\u2019t get out. What helped me and I was very fortunate to take well to the medications and to have a great therapist who I saw just once a week. It was hard for me to afford that therapy at that time. In fact, a friend helped me afford the therapy. But for a few years, I saw this person. I always say I never want to romanticize something like depression. In the moment that someone is depressed, the last thing I would want to insist or say is that this is good for you, and you will learn from this, and it\u2019s valuable. I do think that 10 or 20 years later, if we can walk through these things and survive them, I would absolutely say that the course of my life was changed for the better because of what I had to face. The truths I faced about the ways I was wounded, the pain I was carrying around, the ways I had been so hard on myself, so much harder than I needed to be. I was able to start living differently, over years. That\u2019s kind of a long answer, sorry. Tim Ferriss: This is a long podcast, so long answers are a good fit. What were some of the changes, if you\u2019re able to talk about them, that you made? Krista Tippett: It\u2019s this classic stuff. Again, it\u2019s interesting because I definitely was one of these people who wasn\u2019t sure that I thought \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure what I thought of anybody who went to therapy. It was okay for Woody Allen to do it, right? Tim Ferriss: Guilty as charged over here as well. Krista Tippett: Yeah, I just thought, that\u2019s not me, I don\u2019t need that. Boy, did I need it. It\u2019s these classic things of learning how I survived my childhood with a father who didn\u2019t mean to be cruel, but was. I kept ahead of his sarcasm, I kept ahead of his teasing. I could get positive approval when I blew him away. Only if I did something that was so smart that he had so not thought of, I would have these moments of it being okay. So that\u2019s what I did. I pushed myself really hard and I got through my childhood. I went to amazing places on that same kind of energy, but it was not a way to live. It was not a sustainable way to be human. At that point, in my 30s, if I hadn\u2019t found a way to treat myself more gently, then I think I would\u2019ve just got smaller after that. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve not done a deep dive on this yet, or potentially for myself, and certainly just as an area to explore. I\u2019ve become very interested in CBT \u2013 cognitive behavioral therapy \u2013 and particularly its roots or at least some of the core tenets being similar to Stoicism, which I read constantly, for better or for worse. I think mostly for better. I guess for neutral, if we\u2019re talking about Stoics. The type of therapy \u2013 I\u2019ve never done any type of consistent therapy. I have hired people who would call themselves coaches which may, in fact, offer a very similar support role. But what type of therapy was it that you found most helpful or what were the characteristics that were helpful? Krista Tippett: I just want to say that one of my favorite interviews I did across the years, it was a long time ago now so you probably haven\u2019t seen it, it was with Jennifer Michael Hecht, who is a philosopher and a poet. She wrote a book on doubt, which is just masterful. She talks about the origins of Stoicism and cynicism. She talks about them as graceful life philosophies. We think of them almost as stances against, or neutral. But anyway, I just want to say I don\u2019t think Stoicism is just neutral. Tim Ferriss: Oh, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. I\u2019m really being facetious because I think that Stoicism for most people, brings up the image of a cow standing in the rain or something like that, but it\u2019s much more that. I\u2019ve done a lot of work with publishing and recommending Stoicism as something to explore. There are many different types of therapy. For some people, I\u2019ve spoken with friends, for instance, who really just need to talk, but they don\u2019t want to do it with their friends who are biased in one way or another or they feel guilty because their friends have many different things to do. You go down the list, there a million different variations. What did you find most helpful? Krista Tippett: I didn\u2019t do anything fancy or exciting sounding, like Jungian therapy. I was living in Minnesota at the time, as I still am, and I had this just really good therapist who probably, I would say, family systems was where he was coming from. But I\u2019m not even sure that I knew that language then. I would say, and I think this was kind of part of my survival stuff from my childhood, is I\u2019m not somebody who ever talked to anybody about any of this. One thing I\u2019ve invested so much in, and I think that going through my depression and my therapy has opened up this whole part of my life in the last 20 years is investing in my friendships. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t have friends, I did. But I didn\u2019t lean on people back then. I think I didn\u2019t think it was safe to. This was really the first time that I had just told the truth. I had somebody ask me questions about what it was really like to grow up in my body, in my house. Things that I had never said to myself being the answers. It\u2019s just unpeeling these layers. Then there\u2019s this terrible moment, which I\u2019m sure everybody gets to. I don\u2019t know how far in it was, six months or a year, where you peel away enough layers that you\u2019re actually making progress, and you have to do that to get into a new place, but that moment where you\u2019ve learned things about yourself that are hard and true. You get vulnerable for the first time and you have not yet started to create the foundation for this new way you will live. I remember that moment in therapy as just despairing, where I just felt like \u2013 and I think I said this to my therapist \u2013 I am damaged goods. That\u2019s never the way I had allowed myself to think about myself or certainly anybody else to think of me. But then I don\u2019t know, he kind of helped me walk out of that because that also wasn\u2019t the whole story and the damage part wasn\u2019t all of me. It kind of helps you live into other places in yourself that you haven\u2019t been able to live into because you were so catering to that fear. Does that make sense? Tim Ferriss: No, it does make sense and I think there\u2019s also, at least in my own depressive periods, the acute feeling \u2013 and this is not speaking for you, but speaking for myself \u2013 the acute feeling of being alone or uniquely damaged, whereas maybe we can take solace in the fact that we are all dinged up by the full-contact sport that is life. There are very few people who go through cradle to grave fully intact like a porcelain doll. It tends not to happen. You mentioned a few questions and I\u2019d like to talk about questions. What are the interviews or episodes or experiences that have helped you to grow most as an interviewer? Krista Tippett: I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve thought about that. Honestly, I feel like I\u2019ve grown as an interviewer by doing it. That sounds really simple and it\u2019s very straightforward and it\u2019s something we know more about through science now, right? But for me, it\u2019s been a departure. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve been doing the same thing now for over 12 years, it\u2019s more like 15 years, if you think about the early days when I was creating the show. I guess doing the same thing over and over again, but in this constant mode of learning. When I was younger, when I was in my 20s, I would\u2019ve been really resistant to the idea of doing the same thing for a long period of time. That would\u2019ve felt like stasis to me, kind of not growing anymore. But I do think that I never thought of myself as an interviewer until I created this job. I still consider myself to be a newcomer and an interloper in the world of media, which I know is ridiculous at this point. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty ridiculous. Krista Tippett: I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s ridiculous because that\u2019s not the way that other people see it. So I think that clearly, I do feel like I\u2019m doing something I\u2019m good at. I know how to do this. I have a good set of skills and instincts that lend themselves to this. I truly would say that how I\u2019ve gotten better is doing it over and over and over again. That is such a thrilling thing to get better at something over time. Tim Ferriss: What were some of the mistakes that you made early on as an interviewer? I\u2019m still making mistakes, but I can think of a lot of mistakes that I\u2019ve made. They fall into a handful of categories. What were mistakes you made early on or common novice mistakes? Krista Tippett: I suppose I learned at some point early on that I was better when I could stop. That I was better when I was really planted in the fact that it wasn\u2019t about me. That the point of the interview was drawing out this other person when I could get out of the way. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an essential person in the interview. You and I were having that conversation. I actually think your job right now is harder than my job. Because you are creating this narrative arc. You\u2019re hosting this experience. I\u2019m not belittling the role I had to play. I still had to ask those good questions. I still had to listen well. I had to be able to go with the conversation, but as clear as I could get about the fact that it was about them and not about me, I would be better. I used to have this experience that I would do all these rituals to have good energy. At some point early on I realized that sometimes when I went into the studio for an interview and I was tired for whatever reason, I hadn\u2019t been able to get to sleep or I hadn\u2019t been able to drink the right amount of caffeine, it was a better experience for me and for them. That was one of the signals for me. That when I even by force had to surrender, that actually was part of what made it good. Tim Ferriss: How did that manifest itself in the conversation? Was it longer pauses, more silence? Was it just a greater degree of focus because you were summoning every ounce of strength that you had after an all-nighter to look them in the face and actually hear their words? How did that surrendering manifest itself? Krista Tippett: I guess it did manifest as a calm. I was worried about it as tiredness, but it also took an edge of energy off, which, in fact, was helpful to letting the other person\u2019s energy be what drove the conversation. I think it made me more porous, right? Because I wasn\u2019t able to gear up the way I thought I should. That, in fact, I was letting more in. Tim Ferriss: What habits \u2013 I probably should have asked this at the beginning \u2013 what habits of other interviewers annoy you? I will have to laugh if it\u2019s like four or five things I\u2019ve been doing repeatedly in this conversation. Krista Tippett: No, no. Tim Ferriss: Is there anything that \u2013 [Crosstalk] Krista Tippett: I feel like my answers are impolitic. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s okay. Krista Tippett: There\u2019s a lot. Most of what I see, that\u2019s a big statement. Much of what I see that calls itself interviewing, at least let\u2019s say in news \u2013there\u2019s no many interesting things happening. There\u2019s so many new platforms and this is one of them. Although I\u2019ll say in podcasting what can happen, because it is so easy \u2013 I mean, I actually had to start a public radio show, which was much harder than it should be. It took years and it was like being hazed for years. I can\u2019t even believe it happened because it was so difficult, but that was the only way I could get this thing out there. That\u2019s not true anymore. You can start your podcast. But the danger of that is not to understand that there\u2019s a craft. Not to put any rigor into it. Because there is a craft to creating conversational space that is listenable and it goes somewhere, and that will be affecting for the person who\u2019s being interviewed, as well as the people listening. Anyway, that\u2019s new; that\u2019s a new phenomenon. Even in public radio, which I love, the nature of the experience and of the way things work is that people who we hear at interviewers have been handed a list of questions by producers, which they pose. Then they move on to the next question. That\u2019s just not a conversation to me. The interview proceeds without any reference to what\u2019s just been said, for the most part. It\u2019s something almost scripted. It\u2019s scripted on their end. That drives me crazy. There\u2019s just a lot of lost opportunities for revelation. I guess the other thing that drives me crazy is that when people are going for revelation, it\u2019s often in the form of making their questions sound tough. It\u2019s about how they sound, how they present. We actually reward and laud interviewers who push their subjects into corners and embarrass them. Who put people on the defensive and then they strike out and then that creates the conversation we talk about. I think that rarely accomplishes anything, aside from something entertaining. Something that demeans both of the people in the conversation and demeans us by enjoying it. Tim Ferriss: I agree. I think that it\u2019s adding division to a world that is already divisive enough in a lot of respects. Here\u2019s a bit of a gear shift. This is a question from one of my dear friends who is a huge fan of your show, as are many people, of course. He would love to know what you read to your kids or have read to your kids. Krista Tippett: Well, my kids are now 18 and 21. Tim Ferriss: Right, so before that, when you were reading to them. Krista Tippett: I don\u2019t know that I read \u2013 I remember just reading to my kids was just one of the \u2013 well, it was both beautiful and exhausting. I also remember the nights where they\u2019d say, read me another story and I was like, oh, please, let me go to bed. But it\u2019s also true that those were such special moments. But I read Margaret Wise Brown, like Goodnight Moon and that genre. I am a huge library user. I took my kids to the library all the time and we would walk away with stacks and stacks of books. More than buying books. I didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend when they were really little. I would just say we read everything. What I also did as my kids got older is that I would read \u2013 when they were a little bit too old for the children\u2019s books but liked being read to at night, even just to fall asleep, I would read New Yorker articles or pieces from The New York Times Book Review that were just educational and enjoyable. I really liked that period when they allowed me to do that. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to sprinkle in questions from fans of yours and fans of mine as we go through this. This is another fan question. I\u2019m paraphrasing, in part, but trimming them down in some cases. \u201cI appreciated her interviews with Mary Oliver and poets. What are the top three poems she\u2019d recommend?\u201d I\u2019ll just rephrase this a little bit. For someone who is allergic to poetry or has never viewed themselves as liking poetry for whatever reason, maybe they just had a bad teacher or a bad day in school, what are three poems or poets that you would suggest they start with? Krista Tippett: I have to say I think that\u2019s a daunting question because I probably won\u2019t give the best answer. I do interview so many poets these days. I meet people who tell me they discovered poetry through my show and that just thrills me. But honestly, I\u2019m just like everybody else and poetry has eluded my attention for a lot of my life. I love it and yet it kind of hurts going in. I have to force myself to read it. So I think I\u2019m fortunate to be in this position where I get paid to draw out \u2013 to go sit with Mary Oliver and soak up poetry. What comes to mind, these are just the three poems that come to mind right now. I mean, I do actually think Mary Oliver\u2019s poem, Wild Geese, is incredible. It\u2019s a poem that has saved lives. There\u2019s a line in there that actually comes to me at interesting times. It\u2019s not unrelated to some of the things you and I have been talking about, \u201cLet the soft animal of your body love what it loves,\u201d and sometimes that such an important thing to be able to tell ourselves. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s beautiful. Krista Tippett: It is beautiful. Another poem that I found really important this year. I interviewed a poet named Naomi Shihab Nye. Tim Ferriss: You know what? I literally just pulled up her name because I was going to mention her. Please continue. Krista Tippett: So she has this poem called Kindness, which she wrote after she was, she may have even been on her honeymoon. She was with her husband. I think they were in Colombia. Something happened. They were robbed. I mean, they had this really traumatizing experience. She\u2019s in a different country, sitting by the side of the road, her husband takes off to find help. She actually wrote this poem called Kindness about what happened after that experience. It\u2019s a reminder, it\u2019s just beautiful. It tells a story. But it\u2019s also lines that you can carry around with you that are a reminder that we each of us have so much power in any given day to make the day of a lot of people. There\u2019s so many things for us to feel powerless about, but that\u2019s huge. I like it and it\u2019s about kindness, but it\u2019s unromantic. There\u2019s nothing fluffy, touchy-feely about it. I guess the other thing I\u2019d just recommend is a book. Rilke is probably the name, if there\u2019s one name of somebody that\u2019s not alive that\u2019s come up more often in my show, most often, it\u2019s probably Rilke. There\u2019s a translation of his Book of Hours, which is called Book of Hours: Love Letters to God. It\u2019s translated by a Buddhist teacher named Joanna Macy, and a friend of hers who\u2019s also Buddhist, who\u2019s a psychotherapist named Anita Barrows. I\u2019ve interviewed both of them across the years. Rilke\u2019s German. I lived in Germany for seven years. For some bizarre reason, there\u2019s part of my brain that is in German. I\u2019m very fluent in German. Rilke\u2019s German is exquisitely beautiful. There\u2019s no relation to the kind of guttural German that is in all of our ears from movies. It\u2019s almost like he has his own language. Joanna and Anita have translated, have turned that into English. It\u2019s a book that I return to again and again, the poems in there. Tim Ferriss: Given that you speak both languages, you feel like it captures the essence of Rilke\u2019s German? Krista Tippett: I do, but it does it \u2013 I\u2019ve never been happy with any of the translations of Rilke, any of the others out there. There\u2019s one translator of his letters to a young poet that I like, which is an older translator \u2013 Herter Norton. But this poetry, it\u2019s a creative work. They have not tried to translate every word as it appears. They have done something creative and that veers away from the text in a way that captures what it really does in another language. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll have to check that out. We won\u2019t get into it, but I lived in Berlin for a while myself in 2005. Krista Tippett: You did? When was that? Tim Ferriss: This was 2005. I lived in Prenzlauer Berg for about three months and spent a bit of time in East Berlin for boxing. It was incredible, even at that time, how different when you crossed the line, architecturally and just culturally, everything was different. I had a fantastic time. German, unfortunately for me, maybe it\u2019s due to the noun cases and whatnot, but it is the one language that I lose like sand through the fingers faster than any other. It\u2019s really a shame because I love the language, but can\u2019t win them all. So a few things I want to mention. So Naomi Shihab Nye was the first poet and I was introduced to her through a friend who felt compelled, for whatever reason, this doesn\u2019t happen to me often, to read a poem to me. I thought when I read her work, oh, I can actually understand this. Because in previous encounters with poetry, my overwhelming thought was \u2013 and it was often presented in an academic environment where the more incomprehensible it was, the more valuable it would seem and I just didn\u2019t get it. There\u2019s another book that I picked up a year ago. I\u2019ve been trying to focus less on being obsessed with productivity all the time and part of that is trying to focus on beauty that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a point, for the sake of beauty. Krista Tippett: I love that. That was one of my learning curves [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, like that last 5 percent. Krista Tippett: I\u2019m still working on it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s like that last 5 percent that\u2019s going to make you a miserable wretch and may be not worth it. So I picked up this book because of the title, which I don\u2019t do that often, but a very thin book of poetry called Night Sky with Exit Wounds. I just loved the imagery that conjured. I will warn people, it is very sexually graphic, so if you\u2019re sensitive to that, be aware. Krista Tippett: Who\u2019s the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Ocean Vuong. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m pronouncing the Vietnamese last name properly, but V-U-O-N-G. Really thin and I committed to reading one poem per day in the morning. Krista Tippett: Yeah, that\u2019s good. Tim Ferriss: Which I\u2019m doing right now with the Tao Te Ching, which is the book that probably is in the top four that have come up most often in my own podcast. You mentioned Love Letters to God and I\u2019d like to talk about language for a second. The word \u201cGod\u201d is tricky for a lot of reasons, as you are well familiar. I\u2019m not going to focus on that right now. I will ask \u2013 this is actually a question from a fan \u2013 if you were to choose one word, common or uncommon, which is most important to humanity, what would it be? That\u2019s a huge question, but I\u2019ll let you take us \u2013 Krista Tippett: Obviously, it would not be God. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, or important for us in this modern epoch. Krista Tippett: The word \u201cGod\u201d is too small and it\u2019s too overused and misused. I don\u2019t know, honestly I\u2019d probably say something that might sound cheesy because it\u2019s another overused word, but I think the word \u201clove\u201d is \u2013 I\u2019ve been writing and talking a lot about this over the last couple of years. That the word \u201clove\u201d is so watered down and ruined and yet, it\u2019s just the only thing big enough if we can recapture it in all of its complexity for our life together. And again if we can recapture it as something practical and not merely romantic. Passionate. I think we need to get the passion to it. Love is kind of an amazing word because even though it is completely ruined \u2013 just yesterday, I interviewed Alain de Botton about love and sex and marriage, this philosopher. We talk all the time about the language of falling. That it\u2019s usually something you fall into and fall out of. And yet, there\u2019s only usually one way to say I love you. Those are some of the most incredible words and the most affecting words that any of us can ever hear at any moment. I think even though it\u2019s ruined, that might be my choice if I had to choose one. Tim Ferriss: I have had \u2013 and maybe this is from, I blame it on the language learning and having studied whatever it is, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, etc., that I get very anxious \u2013 maybe this is just also my OCD at work \u2013 amorphous or nebulous words. If something\u2019s not well-defined for me, I don\u2019t like to use it. I\u2019ve avoided using a lot of words whenever possible. \u201cSuccess\u201d I don\u2019t like to use very much, or \u201csuccessful.\u201d Krista Tippett: I do the same thing. There are lots of words that are just messed up. Tim Ferriss: What other words do you try not to use or do you think people should use less? Krista Tippett: I do this all the time, but of course now you\u2019re asking me and I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: We can come back to it too. Krista Tippett: I actually think \u2013 I work a lot with words like \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cprivilege.\u201d We\u2019re just doing a show on whiteness. Some of the things that we need to have big conversations about together and actually just have to start with baby steps. We\u2019re so far from knowing how to have certain conversations, especially around race. But I think the whiteness conversation, even among white people, is a big one. We\u2019ve loaded down \u2013 there are these words and these phrases that are attached to those conversations that just are conversation stoppers. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Krista Tippett: That are very meaningful for the people who are using them, that have a lineage and have substance, but elicit immediate, defensive reactions, are immediately polarizing to the extent that they are counterproductive. I feel like there\u2019s a whole lot of that around race. Even words like \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cjustice,\u201d I don\u2019t use words like that. I like to talk about social healing, rather than social activism. A lot of words we use that we act like have inherently positive connotations like \u201cinnovation\u201d or \u201cprogress,\u201d don\u2019t, right? I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things we do in the name of progress and innovation which are impulsive or which are so bounded by what we can see at the moment, that are going to have terrible effects 20 years from now. I think the best example of this is what we did with food in the latter half of the 20th century and how when I was growing up, my mother being able to make dinner by opening a box and a can was progress. In fact, we have just systematically messed up our bodies, our agriculture and our planet. I think we need to be really wary. \u201cSuccess\u201d is a good one, you\u2019re right. Especially about these words that we kind of reflexively think are good. We need to question a lot of that. We need to be more thoughtful. Tim Ferriss: Or even happiness can fall into that category. Krista Tippett: Terrible. Yeah, I don\u2019t think happiness is a word I use very much. Flourishing. I like that word. Tim Ferriss: I want to mention a few things. The first is that the same friends, or I should say one of the friends, Matt Mullenweg, who\u2019s just a brilliant entrepreneur, a very thoughtful, soulful guy who\u2019s thought of typically as the lead developer of WordPress [inaudible]. Krista Tippett: I know, he\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve been so honored that he \u2013 I think he quoted me in his speech. It\u2019s so amazing. Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s a big fan and his New Year\u2019s resolution assignment to me was to have you on the podcast. I\u2019ve given him his own New Year\u2019s resolution, which explains the Twitter back and forth with him to do a silent retreat. But he introduced me to a book years ago, and I believe it\u2019s called Words That Work, and it\u2019s by Frank Luntz. I believe he was a Republican political strategist. Putting any partisan feelings aside, it really underscores the importance of the words you use and how the words you use affect or perhaps just are your thinking and then that, of course, affects everything else. It\u2019s so critical \u2013 I mean, you mentioned the whiteness episode. You should have a thumbnail of my head. I look like American History X. I\u2019m the palest human you\u2019ve ever seen. But putting my hair loss issues aside, I\u2019ve found that \u2013 and I won\u2019t spend too much time on this, but it\u2019s a very worrisome or worrying trend that I\u2019m observing which is, in say a conversation about race, there is a tremendous and I think it\u2019s both self-induced and contributed to by outside factors. I mean, I can\u2019t do a Q&A anywhere without getting some scoffing comment about white privileged male and it shuts down the conversation. There\u2019s so much self-loathing among, for instance, people who are white and that is a really broad category. I mean, they could be recent immigrants from Albania. They could be fill-in-the-blank. But I do think it\u2019s important to realize that if you \u2013 and this comes back to the point you made about interviewing \u2013 if you immediately put someone on the defense and shut them down, even though you might get the cheap applause for that, it is not in the long term constructive and, in fact, I think it\u2019s very \u2013 it sows the seed of later destruction in many ways. Krista Tippett: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: All right. Shifting gears. Getting off of Hardball with Chris Matthews. Let\u2019s move to eastern practices and philosophies, just to temper it. This is a question from a fan. \u201cSometimes I find eastern practices to be demotivating. How can you reconcile Zen and striving for success?\u201d This is a sentiment that I\u2019ve heard a lot of Type-A folks, myself included, talk about amongst friends related to even meditation. Like I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to lose my edge, type of concerns. How do you think about that? Krista Tippett: Well, I do want to say one thing. I think also it\u2019s like Zen \u2013 you can be an incredible mediator and be very narcissistic, right? So first of all, it\u2019s not like any of these things magically change you or make you a better person. Putting that aside \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m meditating to become more narcissistic. Am I doing it wrong? Krista Tippett: That\u2019s another conversation. Honestly, I think I\u2019m like them. I think that I, as I say, I get a lot done. I personally, even after I started to vicariously benefit greatly from the conversations with Buddhists and contemplatives, just couldn\u2019t do it myself, which is crazy because \u2013 as I was saying to somebody recently, mediating is, in fact, one of life\u2019s few instantaneously rewarding activities. I have had across the years just these one-off experiences of putting myself in that place or being in a setting where I was put in that place. It is transformative. Even in some ways that stay with you. And yet, I could not force myself to keep doing it every day. I guess one thing I would say, I think this matter of spiritual practice and what spiritual practice works for us, it gets to be personal. We are different. What actually changed for me, I at some point decided \u2013 again, even though I\u2019d had these amazing experiences and utterly believe in that, it\u2019s just not for me. It\u2019s when I started doing yoga that I started to let this into my life. What I told myself and this, I think, true, but it\u2019s also kind of my narrative, is that it needed to be active. I needed my body to be moving to calm my mind down. I do a very athletic kind of yoga and I love that. I will say that very gradually, I have held these spiritual technologies in high regard. I have continued to speak with teachers. I\u2019ve continued to have these one-off experiences. I have very gradually developed a really modest practice. I spend 10 minutes every morning, and that\u2019s up from 6 last year. That\u2019s while my tea steeps. So I\u2019m even killing two birds with one stone. It has calmed me down. I think I was ready to be calmed down. It will change you. I think whether it takes your edge off depends on how much in charge you are of how you\u2019re moving through the world to begin with. Tim Ferriss: I think it also, at least where I\u2019ve landed, not everything needs to have an edge. So if you\u2019re looking for a scalpel to cut something effectively, yes, you want an edge. But if you\u2019re trying to sleep, you don\u2019t want to lay on a bed of razor blades. I\u2019ve also noticed oftentimes, for me at least, having only meditated consistently for the last two or three years, that it allows me to be more observant of my own thoughts and therefore more precisely determine what I need and want so that I\u2019m not using an edge to charge through brick walls in a direction that I don\u2019t need to be heading in the first place. Krista Tippett: Right. One of the things that I find really fascinating is how it changes one\u2019s experience of time. I\u2019ve thought a lot over the years \u2013 I know from my conversations with scientists and from the study I did of Einstein, that time is an illusion. The way we\u2019re experiencing it is the way our senses are experiencing it. For example, we walk around with some illusions. As you\u2019re saying, that certain things are a certain way and we have to manage them that way, that, in fact, aren\u2019t reality-based. I used to \u2013 and I think this is very much the question you\u2019re asking \u2013 I get a huge amount done in the first hour to hour and a half that I\u2019m awake in the morning. I\u2019m a little bit OCD about my email inbox and I can\u2019t stand for it to be more than one screen. I have to act on everything before I can get rid of it. But I\u2019m on top of a lot of things. But the way I used to work is that I\u2019d get up early and I would just be clearing through correspondence. My colleagues would get into the office and their inboxes would be full of all this stress from me. What I had told myself forever is this is how I got everything done. This is how I stayed on top of all these jobs I\u2019m doing because I was productive. Then when I committed myself to sitting quietly before I opened my inbox, before I did anything like that, I didn\u2019t get as much done before 7:00 in the morning, but it all got done, right? Tim Ferriss: Right. Krista Tippett: This was a strange feeling. That I felt I was, by some measure, less productive, but that did not mean that there wasn\u2019t time in the day and it was much less stressful and it was less stressful for the people on the other end of my emails. Tim Ferriss: Then there\u2019s also the question of, what are you being productive for? If it\u2019s to improve your quality of life on some level, then you are, in fact, being more productive by being less productive, if that makes any sense. Krista Tippett: Yeah, right. Tim Ferriss: Here\u2019s a question. I think it reinforces for me the importance of defining one particular word. This may be what you just described, so you don\u2019t have to repeat that if that\u2019s the case. But one of the fan questions is, what can one do daily to begin a small but marked increase in spiritual awareness? I\u2019d like to pose that question, but I\u2019d also like you to define \u201cspiritual\u201d for us because this is one of the words that I\u2019ve dodged myself for the most part. Living in San Francisco, you can only imagine how many different ways this word is used. You can barely walk down the street without tripping over a didgeridoo and someone doing AcroYoga and so on. How would you define spiritual and then if you\u2019d like to take a stab at this question, what someone could do daily to begin a small but marked increase in spiritual awareness? Krista Tippett: Well, I think practices are important and I do think that everybody gets to find what works for them, what works for their personality type, what works for their life. It\u2019s the same thing if you\u2019re talking about prayer. There are a lot of people who pray, but there are so many forms of doing that and they don\u2019t all work for everyone. What I think is important in human life that our spiritual traditions have always known is ritual. In a way, what we\u2019re talking about, you could say that your meditation practice is also a form of ritual. It\u2019s setting aside time when you are recollecting yourself. Now we know from science, you\u2019re also calming yourself. You\u2019re doing all these great things for your wellbeing on every level. What I would want to say, also, about beginning a spiritual practice, I think ritual is really critical because I just think as creatures we need it too. It\u2019s a human need and spiritual life benefits from that. But also I don\u2019t like to think of spiritual life as a compartment of life. I think that it\u2019s how you move through your days. I think those rituals actually can help you internalize that. It\u2019s as much about how you are present to whatever you are doing. That\u2019s also spiritual practice. Then something else I would say about that is it\u2019s not about being perfect. But it is about intentionality and it\u2019s about forgiving yourself and it\u2019s about being gentle with yourself and others. It\u2019s a gentle thing. It doesn\u2019t have to be something that you could wear on your sleeve. One of the conversations I\u2019ve had with Sylvia Borstein, who\u2019s a Jewish Buddhist teacher and talks about spirituality can be folding the towels sweetly, right? Some of the great mystics, Brother Lawrence wrote this book, The Practice of the Presence of God and he talked about washing the dishes as an act of prayer. Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh does that too. How you wash the dishes. So that\u2019s important. Then the final thing I would say that is actually included in those kinds of ways of being that I just mentioned, is that it\u2019s embodied, it\u2019s bodily \u2013 at this point in my life, I\u2019m really not very interested in anything that is merely spiritual. It\u2019s doing yoga, getting into my body, and also it\u2019s in our bodies that we encounter other human beings. This has deepened my spiritual life as much as any other technically spiritual activity. Part of this is about us giving ourselves permission to see what is ordinary as spiritual practice. That is a real relief. Tim Ferriss: If you couldn\u2019t use the word \u201cspiritual,\u201d would it be a combination then of empathy, presence? I\u2019m just wondering what the components are. Krista Tippett: Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. Tim Ferriss: For instance, I\u2019m thinking of a very good friend of mine, Sam Harris, certainly controversial but very well-spoken and very thoughtful in many respects. He has an extremely well-developed meditative practice. He\u2019s very present when you talk to him. I think he is able to enjoy the small things. From that perspective, he checks a lot of the boxes, but he\u2019s certainly a non-believer when it comes to religion and would consider himself an atheist more so than spiritual, but is he spiritual? I guess it depends on how we define it. I\u2019m just curious what words you might use that are the pre-conditions or the components of that. Again, it can be a very personal definition. I\u2019m just wondering how you [inaudible]. Krista Tippett: Spirituality is one of these words that I try not to overuse because it is amorphous. I also think you can\u2019t avoid it. I know that for people who are atheist or agnostic, you find different degrees of comfort with the spirituality language. Let me just say this, I don\u2019t think that anybody stops having a spiritual life because of the absence of a belief in God. I think an atheist can have a spiritual life and I think every atheist I know has a spiritual life. I also acknowledge that some of them wouldn\u2019t like that language, and I would honor that. It\u2019s not about faith. I would say inner life, interior life is one way to approach it. That doesn\u2019t quite get at spiritual, but it gets pretty close to me. And again, there are many ways of doing inner life and interior life as there are people. Tim Ferriss: For sure. Here\u2019s a different question, which is \u2013 this is from a fan \u2013 what do you think about the notion that wisdom comes with age? If so, how can we become wise beyond our years? Krista Tippett: I think wisdom does not necessarily come with age. Some people get old and wise and some people just get old. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d love to hear how you define it. I mentioned Sam. Sam has jokingly said before that wisdom in some capacity \u2013 I\u2019m paraphrasing \u2013 is learning to follow your own advice. Something along those lines, which I liked quite a bit. But, yeah. How do you think of this? Krista Tippett: About a definition of wisdom? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Krista Tippett: I want to say that to me, wisdom \u2013 to me, every stage of life, there\u2019s a capacity for wisdom at many different stages of any life, I think. So yes, there is something very special about a person who has lived a long time and accumulated wisdom by way of experience, the fullness of the human experience. By how they have moved through that and what they\u2019ve internalized and they\u2019ve moved through. What they\u2019ve integrated into their wholeness. How they\u2019ve integrated what has gone wrong into their wholeness. But that\u2019s just one kind of wisdom. There\u2019s a wisdom of young children that can be uncanny. Four-year-olds say things and ask things that drive to the heart of the matter. There\u2019s a wisdom of teenagers and of people in their 20s. There\u2019s this ability to see the world whole and to have a whole vision of change and this fierceness, this urgency about that. I think there are these flashes of wisdom at different stages of life and that it is something that\u2019s accessible that we can practice and aspire to. Like we practice and aspire to other skills. How I define it contradicts that a little bit. Because usually \u2013 and it\u2019s interesting because I wrote a whole book about wisdom without defining wisdom. As soon as I was out talking about the book, this is one of the first questions people would ask me, how do you define wisdom? And I realized I\u2019d never done that. You could say there was a few hundred pages about it, but what I think distinguishes wisdom from knowledge or accomplishment or intelligence \u2013 I think a wise person can have all those things, but it\u2019s not a position. It\u2019s not like you look at someone as they are smart, they are intelligent, they are accomplished. The measure of wisdom is the imprint a life makes on other lives, on the world around it. [With a wise person, it\u2019s almost something that\u2019s palpable. It\u2019s something you can see. That\u2019s kind of where I\u2019ve come with the definition. Tim Ferriss: I like that. I\u2019m jumping from one big concept to another, but I think these are worth exploring, so here\u2019s a question. \u201cKrista herself is very calming, very good at finding meaning. Can you ask her how she does it? How does she consistently see the best and most meaningful things in the world around her?\u201d This is something, just out of pure self-interest I\u2019d love to hear you answer, because I can sometimes get so trapped with blinders on that I find it difficult to see the best and most meaningful things in the world around me. So I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts. Krista Tippett: Well, I don\u2019t want to burst anyone\u2019s bubble. I mean, what people\u2019s experience of me are these very intense containers in which I\u2019m fully present to another human being and have immersed myself in who they are. I am there to absolutely draw out the best of them, to help them put words around something maybe they can\u2019t put words around, and that we\u2019re all present while that happens. Now, I\u2019m going to be kind to myself and I\u2019m going to say that at this point in my life, I am actually getting to the point where I live that way a lot of the time. That I couldn\u2019t have said that for the first 50 years. Really, the short answer to that question is practice. At some point, about 15 years ago, I started walking in this direction. I was fortunate to create this job that allows me to do this with an intensity and a primacy in my life. But I don\u2019t think you have to have this job to be doing this. I keep putting myself in this position and anytime you keep putting yourself in a certain place, in a certain position, practicing certain things year after year, it changes you and this has changed me. Tim Ferriss: What is the position that someone else could put themselves in if they wanted a homework assignment? Krista Tippett: I think you could do this. You can do this in terms of how you interact with your colleagues in the workplace. It\u2019s one of the things Adam Grant writes about, right? Givers in the workplace change everybody. I also know \u2013 and this is just as true across my career as anybody else\u2019s, that the workplace can be one of the most stressful places. I always wanted to do a show \u2013 we were a part of a big media organization until three years ago. I always wanted to do a radio show called \u201cThe Problem of Evil in the Workplace,\u201d which I thought evil is so much greater and workplace \u2013 that was much more devastating than whatever \u2013 of my fear of earthquakes or fires. Where you work, where you live, with your children, with your family, becoming a neighbor in a different way. I feel like the great challenge that is before us now as a country is to figure out what common life means, to reimagine it. I think we actually have to reinvent it. I think even if our political life weren\u2019t so fractured, we\u2019d have to reinvent it and maybe this is one reason our political life is so fractured. It\u2019s just not going to look like the same thing in the 21st century as it did in the latter half of the 20th century. That is about, in very practical ways, getting to know our neighbors who have become strangers. That is a calling for now. Any time any of us do that, in whatever small way in our communities, that is practicing presence and practicing real curiosity. Working on asking better questions. Caring to find out details and nuance and complexity. Those are ways to talk about what I do in this work I do. Tim Ferriss: And also not to respond too quickly to statements. Another quote of yours that I like and you can correct me if I\u2019m getting this wrong, but \u201cI can disagree with your opinion, it turns out, but I can\u2019t disagree with your experience.\u201d I think there\u2019s so many problems in this world, in this country certainly because people confuse the two. If someone is telling you a factual recounting of something that happened to them that is very different from saying \u201cI think you should,\u201d or providing an opinion. Those are two very different things. Keeping that in mind is very helpful to mitigate overreacting emotionally to other people. In, I suppose the Stoic sense that is very practical and applicable, less than the trying to remain Spock at all times. I\u2019ve really found that quote of yours, that concept at least, very helpful to think about. Experience and opinion, those are two different things. So you can provide your experience without, also and even preface it, and I\u2019ve done this before, and say \u201cI can only comment on my personal experience. I don\u2019t want to give you a bunch of opinions, but here\u2019s been my experience. This is what has happened to me,\u201d or something along those lines. It diffuses a lot of these potentially volatile situations. Krista Tippett: Yeah, it humanizes. We have all these ways we think we know each other. We think we know what each other are about and they have to do with positions and issues, right? Or how somebody voted. We don\u2019t know each other on a human level. I\u2019ve been thinking since the election about I learned, I started my vision for doing this and kind of a bit of my methodology started in this project. I did it for some Benedictine monks back in the late \u201890s. They were Ecumenicist, which when they started doing it was a completely revolutionary thing. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to plead ignorance here. Can you define that for me? Krista Tippett: What? Ecumenism? Tim Ferriss: Yes, please. Krista Tippett: Well, it was like inter-Christian, interdenominational conversation which we forget that in the 1960s, it was absolutely radical when Catholics and Protestants started talking to each other. Tim Ferriss: Right. Krista Tippett: Then when they added Jews, it was amazing. The difference between Armenian Orthodox Christians and Nazarene Holiness Christians is vast as the difference between different faiths. That\u2019s what this place was about. They would take up big theological questions and big theological divides and by posing a question and asking people to answer the question through the story of your life. Which actually you still got to really big, heady places in the discussion, but you humanized it as you got there. I\u2019ve been thinking since the election, I think this would work. I don\u2019t know how it would be structured, but what if we could create these experiences where people got together in trustworthy spaces where they could be safe, they were safe, and you had people start talking about why did you vote for Donald Trump? Or why did you vote for Hillary Clinton? Answer the question through the story of your life. Then we would actually start talking about eventually the things we need to start talking about. Including economics and our children\u2019s futures and the fact that we have a shared stake in all of our children\u2019s futures. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m glad you brought that up because it\u2019s a very \u2013 I didn\u2019t ever put this together because I hadn\u2019t heard you say that before, but it\u2019s also intensely practical to say \u201canswer the question through the story and experience of your life,\u201d because it has full context. It\u2019s not abstract. And, in fact, there\u2019s an organization called The Entrepreneurs Organization, and they have chapters all over the country and regional and city-wide groups of entrepreneurs who want to help one another. I\u2019m going to probably going to get this slightly off. I\u2019ve spoken at a number of EO events, but I\u2019m not a member myself. Since I live in the Silicon Valley, I can\u2019t escape entrepreneurs. But the rules, as I remember them, are that the group, the chapter is split into what I think are called forums, which are groups of say four to five people. I\u2019m sure my fans will correct me if I\u2019m getting this wrong. But when someone in the forum, that is your social accountability group and primary cohort, when someone asks a question, \u201cHey I\u2019m trying to figure out how to franchise in this following state, what should I do?\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m trying to solve this particular problem with hiring or annoying public\u201d or fill-in-the-blank. You cannot use conjecture in answering the question. You can only answer the question through a story or experience that is from your personal life. Krista Tippett: Yeah, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the same thing, yeah. The only thing \u2013 so it\u2019s very practical. It\u2019s something anybody could do. The only thing that we have to create that we don\u2019t have now is we don\u2019t \u2013 and this is a big order \u2013 is space and time. We would need to create to somehow spaces, as I say, that are trustworthy, where it would be reasonable to invite people in and expect them to show some vulnerability and tell some truth. It wouldn\u2019t actually be reasonable to ask people to do that in most of our political spaces, in a lot of our public spaces now. That\u2019s something we\u2019d have to make happen. Also, time. Because like with these monks, with these gatherings in Collegeville, they would have five days. Everybody would spend 45 minutes or an hour answering that question on the first day. Then that was an incredible foundation. It\u2019s hard for the next few days. It\u2019s hard to imagine us carving out that kind of time and space, but we could figure this out if we wanted to. Tim Ferriss: I think also going into thinking about these larger, polarizing issues with the expectation that the conversations are going to be very uncomfortable. That none of the biggest problems you\u2019ll face in your own life, in the lives of others as a community, a country, fill-in-the-blank, are going to be comfortable. When you have these stakes involved, if I could implore anyone listening to this to do one thing, certainly in the U.S. and elsewhere, is to regularly practice exposing yourself to uncomfortable conversations so that you can get better at navigating them without vilifying the other person or emotionally overreacting. It requires practice, just like negotiation, just like playing tennis, just like anything else. If you wait for the big topic, whether it\u2019s some aspect of race or otherwise, to debut your conversational skills with discomfort, you\u2019re going to make huge mistakes that are going to be counterproductive and probably destructive. Krista Tippett:Yeah, and the other thing that I think goes along with that is question the reflexes you have about how you walk into those encounters and what you\u2019re going to talk about. Because we have all these kind of dead-end, built-in instincts about the debate we will have or how we will present or defend our positive or be advocates or change someone\u2019s mind. Or we go in with all kinds of assumptions about them. I really don\u2019t think this is rocket science, but part of what we have to work through are all the instincts we\u2019re carrying that don\u2019t serve us well. This is connected to that, if you want to talk to people across difference, you probably don\u2019t start with that, right? We just think we have to do everything head-on. We\u2019re Americans, we have to accomplish something. We\u2019ve got an hour here. So I\u2019ll tell you one of the most helpful stories. I think a good model for this is I was in Iowa the week after the election and there was this woman who talked to me about how she and a group of parents who she knows, who are pretty much split down the middle in terms of who they voted for in the election, share a concern about the effect that the corrosive public speech and the corrosive public campaign had on their children, their children\u2019s imaginations. They were gathering across these divides of politics with this shared entry point of all of them caring about their children. Whoever they voted for, being able to have this really constructive conversation that was meaningful to all of them about what they\u2019re going to teach their children, how they\u2019re going to talk to them. The realities they want to create moving forward. I think you can get really far down the road with that without ever having to talk about why you voted for who you voted for, and yet it creates a possibility of relationship, which creates all kinds of other possibilities. Kind of coming at this from a sideways direction. Tim Ferriss: Absolutely. I think that sometimes the most directly impactful approach is the oblique approach. Krista Tippett: Yeah, the slant. Coming at a slant. Tim Ferriss: One of the things that helped me a lot to navigate my own emotions so that I could less trigger other people\u2019s emotions, so it\u2019s a win/win, was radical \u2013 still is, I re-read this book on a fairly regular basis \u2013 Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach. Krista Tippett: I read that. Tim Ferriss: I found it hugely helpful for me, personally. What books, other than your own, have you gifted the most to other people? Krista Tippett: I have gifted that Rilke book. Tim Ferriss: And who are the authors again? This was Love Letters to God? Krista Tippett: It\u2019s Joanna Macy, M-A-C-Y, and Anita Barrows. It\u2019s Rilke\u2019s Book of Hours and the subtitle is Love Poems to God. I have gifted Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n\u2019s When Things Fall Apart. That\u2019s kind of a sacred text that I carry around with me at all times because things are always falling apart. That\u2019s a book I feel like I can pick up anywhere at any moment and read a paragraph and it will be redemptive. I also love Rilke\u2019s Letters to a Young Poet. I give that to young people. It\u2019s not really about poetry. It\u2019s about life and there\u2019s some wonderful things in there about love and the facile understanding of love that we walk around with and the idea of giving yourself time to grow up and grow into what love can be. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good selection. Krista Tippett: At other times in my life, I gave away all the books I loved and as a result, I don\u2019t have many books. Tim Ferriss: If you were giving the opportunity or maybe the assignment to each a lecture, a seminar, it\u2019s an ongoing class with either college freshman or college seniors, which would you choose and what would you teach? Krista Tippett: I\u2019m sorry, college freshmen or college seniors? Tim Ferriss: Right. Krista Tippett: Gosh, I don\u2019t know how I would choose. I do spend a lot of time with people that age. I love it. I guess I would choose college seniors just because I think you\u2019re so much under formation in those years and still as a college senior. What would I teach? They\u2019re growing up into this world of disarray now. I don\u2019t know if this is a teaching subject, but I\u2019m thinking a lot about the narrative that we all walk around internalizing and working with, which is the narrative we receive from whatever was in The New York Times today, whatever was in the headlines of NPR or whatever our chosen media is, Buzzfeed or whatever it is we\u2019re reading. How that is not the whole story and how when we walk around too shaped by that narrative, it\u2019s overwhelming. It actually is very paralyzing. It does not tell or give people to work with other realities, like generative realities. That the things that are actually saving us, the things that are growing us up. Focusing on that and focusing on a long view of time, as opposed to this 24/7 instant view of time, which makes us small. Taking seriously, treating as a data point the beautiful and noble people and projects you see around you. It doesn\u2019t refute the hard things that are happening, but it\u2019s also true. Tim Ferriss: What exercises might you have those students do or readings that you would assign to help them with this? Krista Tippett: I would just want them to get a big view of time. To see this as a moment within a much larger canvas of time and to see what we internalize as the news, which we too often internalize as the whole of \u2013 kind of a snapshot of reality. To be able to create some skills to put all of that into perspective and to ask what might really be important that we\u2019re not talking about. I don\u2019t know. If I had to teach skills, I suppose, which is really your question, I think these days I would love to do \u2013 and I didn\u2019t do a creative course, but Udemy did something through Acumen which, of course, is listening in conversation. I would love to teach just about the art of conversation, the practice of listening, the practical tools, as well as the kind of presence, the intentionality that needs to go into that. These are practical skills. I think listening is a basic social art. It\u2019s not just that we have to relearn them and we have to kind of learn things, except that we have very actively learned work against them. We\u2019ve all really been trained in the tools of advocacy, representing our positive and we need those skills, but we actually need to retire them also. We need to dampen those as reflexively as the only things we know how to do. I think that could be fun. The art of asking better questions. Tim Ferriss: Absolutely. The quality of our questions determining the questions of our lives, as Tony Robbins would say, I think it\u2019s reflected not only in the questions that you ask others, but the questions you ask yourself, which is part of the beauty of what\u2019s been so fun about slowly trying to strengthen my Bambi legs and interviewing myself is becoming better at asking questions in my own head. Who are some of the best listeners you know or have known? Krista Tippett: Sometimes people say to me, \u201cYou\u2019re a professional listener. You must have grown up with great listeners.\u201d But I\u2019m the other story. I\u2019m the story of the person who grew up surrounded by people who didn\u2019t listen. In the absence of that, I felt I needed it. I didn\u2019t grow up with a lot of models. While there are certainly many good journalists and hosts, as I say, I don\u2019t really take my models from traditional media. The good listeners I know are not famous people. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s okay; they don\u2019t have to be famous. Krista Tippett: They\u2019re my friend, Mel, who\u2019s in her 80s, who is just one of the wisest people I know and one of the dearest people I know, and the person who encouraged me to work on this project that sounded pretty farfetched when I first had the idea. She really cares. She\u2019s really curious. She\u2019s also a joyful person. That joy is infectious. She\u2019s a great listener. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any favorite documentaries or movies? Krista Tippett: I\u2019m so bad at these questions about favorites. Everything goes out of my mind. In fact, a lot of people ask me what was my favorite interview. In fact, I just had this exchange about a week ago, where I was a little bit frosty with somebody because they said, \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite interview this ever?\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t choose. I love them all.\u201d Or \u201cWho was your favorite interview this year?\u201d I always say, \u201cMy favorite interview was the last one I did.\u201d They said, \u201cYou\u2019re being very diplomatic.\u201d No, I\u2019m not being diplomatic; it\u2019s true. I would say my favorite movie would probably be the last one I watched, except I watch a lot more TV than movies these days. I love how we\u2019re relearning storytelling and doing it well on TV. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s some incredible writing and otherwise on TV. What do are you watching currently or what\u2019s the last memorable TV show that you watched? Krista Tippett: I think I watched a lot of things I love this summer. I loved The Night Manager. I\u2019ve been reading John le Carr\u00e9, and all my years in Germany. I love that kind of thing. I love those thriller stories. I loved True Blood. I loved the vampires. There\u2019s so much TV that I like right now. I\u2019m watching The Affair. Tim Ferriss: Ah, The Affair. All right, so just as a quick side note for The Affair. A lot of it or a portion of it takes place in a restaurant called \u201cThe Lobster Roll\u201d out on Long Island in Montauk. Krista Tippett: Is that a real place? Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a real place. My second-ever job was a busboy at The Lobster Roll. Krista Tippett: Are you enjoying it? Are you enjoying the show? Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t seen the show, in fact. I haven\u2019t. I know a few people I grew up with, fellow townies on Long Island, who have said it\u2019s very surreal to watch. I remember getting yelled at by rich city people and having to clean up their messes. Krista Tippett: That\u2019s so funny. That\u2019s so funny that it\u2019s a real place. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Very much a real place. If you had one gigantic billboard you could put a short message on it to get it out to millions of people, what would you put on that? Krista Tippett: I think I\u2019m really bad at these questions. Tim Ferriss: I can zig instead of zag here and we can do different types of questions. But if anything comes to mind, let me know. Otherwise we can table it and come back. Krista Tippett: Okay, maybe that line that you started with right now. That anger is what fear and pain look like when they show themselves in public. I think that would be a good thing for people to reflect on, even briefly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, absolutely. You talked a little bit about your morning. You mentioned the meditation while your tea was steeping, if I remember correctly. What does the first 60 minutes of a good day for you \u2013 what does that look like? Krista Tippett: Yeah, a good day is like I\u2019ve had a pretty good sleep. I love my sleep. I get up and I do, I start to make my tea. Tim Ferriss: What time do you wake up and what kind of tea? Krista Tippett: I wake up about 6:30. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s your go-to tea? Krista Tippett: It\u2019s Yorkshire Gold. Tim Ferriss: Yorkshire Gold. Is that a black tea? Krista Tippett: Yeah, which is what makes good, strong, black tea in Minnesota. I think everywhere you are with the water it\u2019s different. Yeah, I sit for about ten minutes and sometimes I read a little bit. I read a little Thomas Orton, or a little Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n, or a little Rilke, and then I actually have started adding prayer back into my meditation. I realized that\u2019s my mother tongue and that\u2019s kind of been a revelation for me to start doing that again. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not particularly religious. I was just speaking to a very close friend of mine recently who is. What are your prayers like? Krista Tippett: It\u2019s an interesting question. For a long time, I used to have a Book of Common Prayer and I used to read the compline, these compline services, these ancient services. It\u2019s very poetic. Recently \u2013 I\u2019ve never talked to anybody about this \u2013 this summer, I got quiet and rested for the first time in about ten years. It was amazing. I was on Big Sur. It was incredible. One thing I did was I actually wrote a prayer. It was like the prayer of my life right now. It was such an incredible thing to do. I never thought of doing that. I think the thing is, and I\u2019ve been saying, I think spiritual life is very \u2013 we all have personality types, so you have to find what works for you. I grew up Southern Baptist, which is all very free-flowing. When the minister was praying, you were supposed to be praying your own prayer in your head. There\u2019s something about me that likes \u2013 I like liturgy, I like ritual. But I think previously I would have thought that even writing my own prayer would be not as good as a prayer that had been around for hundreds or thousands of years. But somehow I managed something that is a really good way for me to move into the day. I say that and I also have some time of silence and just breathing and sometimes kind of a mantra. All of this in ten minutes. Isn\u2019t that incredible? I\u2019m so productive. Of course, just like everybody else, I will be distracted for six of those ten minutes. I think that\u2019s why having a bit of liturgy that you have to stick to, like having something to hang on with. Then I make my tea and put my milk in it and I get to email. If I have writing to do, I do that in the mornings. Just when my mind is clear. I\u2019m happy if I\u2019ve prepared the day with important correspondence or with getting some important ideas out. Then eventually I go to work about 9:30 or 10:00. Usually I have something to record in the morning. Tim Ferriss: I have to ask, because my fans will certainly ask me why I didn\u2019t ask you. You don\u2019t have to share, but would you be open to sharing your prayer? Or is that something you\u2019d prefer not to discuss. Krista Tippett: You mean now? At this time? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Krista Tippett: I can tell you what it\u2019s \u2013 maybe I can tell you \u2013 gosh, can I even, it\u2019s just funny because I\u2019ve learned it by heart. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, or what it\u2019s about. However \u2013 I know people would love more details because it\u2019s so valuable to you. Krista Tippett: In a way, it reflects that I\u2019ve been learning about myself, like what I need to work on my inner life, my spiritual work. The thing that I\u2019ve been \u2013 I pray to keep learning to open my heart and keep learning to let go of the kind of resistance and protectiveness that saved me when I was growing up and it doesn\u2019t fit \u2013 it became an armor around my natural love and trust and softness. That\u2019s kind of my life work, right? I\u2019m so much better. I mean, just the fact that I can say it that way means I\u2019m getting somewhere. But it\u2019s still my life work. I pray that \u2013 it\u2019s like when I incline to ambition, to know to take the light. That what I fear that I might welcome and I pray about blessing the \u2013 constantly knowing the difference between intentions and consequences. Because I think there\u2019s something mysterious about what becomes of our actions that we don\u2019t control and that\u2019s actually largely a wonderful thing. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily converge with my American can-do accomplishment mentality. So lean into that. That you do the right thing for the right reason and to some extent you have to let go of what becomes of it. That\u2019s kind of some of the big ideas. Of course, again, I say it every morning and now I \u2013 I spent some time last December in Austria with Brother David Steindl-Rast. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard that interview. He\u2019s a Benedictine monk. He\u2019s Austrian. He\u2019s one of the great people in the world thinking about gratitude. That\u2019s probably one of those words I avoid a little bit too because it\u2019s just been on too many Hallmark cards. What I like about him is he lived through the fascist occupation of his country as a teenager. He knows how gritty the world is. One of the things he says is that it would be absurd for any of us to say that you should be grateful for everything that happens to you. We don\u2019t say that. But that you can be grateful in every moment. That\u2019s really stuck with me, so that\u2019s how my prayer ends. Teach me to be grateful in every moment. That\u2019s a practice that helps me. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s extremely powerful and thank you for sharing. I\u2019m glad you did. I think that\u2019s going to be \u2013 I think that many pieces of that will be extremely helpful for many people. Thank you. Krista Tippett: Well, I certainly did not expect to talk about that. Tim Ferriss: I didn\u2019t expect to ask you about it. It makes me also want to go find Wild Geese that you mentioned earlier on top of that. Well, just one or two more questions and then I\u2019ll let you get back to your day. This is basically the tail end. I\u2019d like to ask if you have any \u2013 and I\u2019ll ask where people can find you and so on \u2013 but first, do you have any requests of my audience? The people listening. Anything that you\u2019d like them to take away? Anything you\u2019d like them to try? Anything you\u2019d like them to consider or otherwise? Any parting words for the people listening? Krista Tippett: As I said a minute ago, I\u2019m just intensely aware of how many messages we internalize. I feel that gets in the way of people really knowing how much power they have in terms of how they move through the world, the world around them, the people they can see and touch. The small and large interactions we have. We live in this bizarre moment where the place we have wanted to look for modeling and leadership and the way forward are very dysfunctional and partly because of our technology. We\u2019re turn-of-century people. We\u2019re in this moment where all of us who are adults were born in one world of assumptions and institutions that made sense and we are growing up or growing old in a world in which most of our disciplines, the way things have been done, don\u2019t make sense. We have to create the changed realities and it\u2019s not going to happen from the top. That\u2019s not the way our digital world works anyway. But I think we have more power, more agency to do that than we are made to feel. It\u2019s a wonderful calling. I think we have to keep each other, accompany each other in keeping that sense. That would be my encouragement. Somebody was talking to me yesterday about a phrase, \u201csocial courage.\u201d I think that\u2019s a good way to talk. That\u2019s something I want to invite people and call people\u2019s attention to, just to make clear that is available to us. Tim Ferriss: I can\u2019t think of any time when that has been more important, certainly in my lifetime, that I am consciously aware of than right now. Being socially courageous, which I think also means probably presenting and potentially defending important views or perspectives or experiences that are very unpopular. Krista Tippett: I think in terms of the different callings of this moment. Some of us are going to have to defend and some of us may have to put our bodies in the way of danger that is coming to some people who are on the front lines of vulnerability. I also think there\u2019s a calling for many of us to be calmers of fear. Tim Ferriss: Yes. Krista Tippett: I think there\u2019s some very quiet callings right now that can also make a huge difference. Tim Ferriss: Krista, this has been so much fun. I really appreciate you taking the time. I\u2019d like to encourage people to check our your work. Where can people say hello? Where can people find out more about you and if you have any recommended starting points, and I\u2019m not going to ask you a favorite interview question because I don\u2019t like getting that any more than you do. But where can people find you and what would you suggest they start with, if you have a recommendation? Krista Tippett: The website is onbeing.org. We also have something called The Civil Conversations Project that we\u2019re going to be building out. There\u2019s also a civilcoversationsproject.org website. It actually has a little guide I wrote that we\u2019re calling \u201cBetter Conversations.\u201d We have the On Being app in the app store and, of course, you can find the On Being podcast in iTunes or wherever you get podcasts. I am not on Facebook. For some reason, it just makes me break out in hives. But I do actually love Twitter. I mostly go there to correspond and communicate with people who reach out to me there. That\u2019s a good place to check in. Tim Ferriss: @KristaTippett. Krista Tippett: Yeah, just @KristaTippett. Two Ps, two Ts. Tim Ferriss: You have to do that as much as I do \u2013 double-R, double-S. Krista Tippett: But Tim, I want to thank you so much. Also, I was really tired today. Here we are \u2013 isn\u2019t it Friday the 13th today? Tim Ferriss: It is Friday the 13th. Krista Tippett: Anyway, it\u2019s Friday afternoon and I\u2019m so tired today and it\u2019s just been really energizing. You have built something amazing and I\u2019m so amazed that you\u2019re listening to On Being and I\u2019m really grateful to meet your audience that are people like this. Tim Ferriss: Well, it\u2019s really fun and meaningful for me to have you on. I hope this is not the last conversation that we have. Krista Tippett: Yeah, well, we\u2019ll get together at some time and talk about Berlin. Tim Ferriss: Yes. I would love to do that and you can listen to my mangled German. But that\u2019s okay. Ein fu\u00df nach dem anderen, right? It\u2019s one little step after the other. As I butcher yet another language. Krista Tippett: That\u2019s good. Tim Ferriss: Thank you so much. To everybody listening, as always, you can find show notes, links to everything that we discussed, at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, all spelled out, as well as every other episode.

quote", "well, i guess the context of that quote or how i walk around with that thought is it\u2019s such an important context and piece of perspective to dealing with the level of emotion in our public life right now", "it\u2019s in politics, but it\u2019s really everywhere", "we take things at face value that we would be wiser to not take at face value", "we would be wiser to be taking more breaths and understanding that things are true of other people that are also true of us that when we\u2019re upset, often the thing we say and do is really a deflection of what we\u2019re actually upset about or how we\u2019re upset", "in terms of our public life right now, this way we have of reacting to each other\u2019s surfaces is getting in the way, among other things, it\u2019s getting in the way of us grappling with all the very real things we need to grapple with that actually are of our shared interest and have to do with our common wellbeing", "definitely", "it\u2019s seemed to me also that anger is often what fear sometimes looks like when it shows itself in public", "i\u2019ve heard you say before that your father was fearful", "i was hoping you might elaborate on that and in doing so, just give us some context for your childhood", "yes, and maybe that\u2019s part of the reason i have a sensitivity to this, because i think my father had a terrible first three years of his life, which we didn\u2019t know then but we know now is so completely formative in terms of how people handle the rest of their lives", "i\u2019m not sure exactly what happened to him, i think he was possibly abused", "it was possibly violent", "at best, it was severely neglectful", "my father was this kind of larger-than-life character", "that\u2019s how he presented", "and, of course, he was my father so he was this huge, powerful character, but i think even from a very young age, i sensed that underneath he was very frightened", "yeah, i hadn\u2019t actually thought recently about how that may be helping me imagine that inside the political dynamics in america right now", "where did you grow up", "i grew up in a small town in oklahoma", "it\u2019s a good wrestling state, that much i know", "really", "the only sport i knew growing up was football", "i was the only person i knew who was against football", "against football", "i can\u2019t say i\u2019m against wrestling because that was the only sport i could be half-competent at growing up, so i idolized john smith, who is just this incredible savant/super-human athlete in the world of wrestling from oklahoma, who then turned into an amazing coach", "why were you against football", "i don\u2019t know that i was always against football", "i just felt like it got too much attention and then when i got older, i had this enlightened moment in high school, were i was a debater", "i did drama and debate", "that\u2019s what actually kept my brain alive growing up", "i found out that the high school football team had a $50,000.00 budget, which included steak dinners for all the players after every game", "this was one of my first introductions to injustice in the world", "i protested that and it absolutely colored by view of football", "that was a lot of money", "i mean, that\u2019s a lot of money now", "it was a huge amount of money in 1960s, \u201870s", "it is a lot of money", "it\u2019s a money machine, as a lot of people know", "you mentioned drama and debate and i know that there have been a lot of formative moments, as for all people in your childhood and throughout high school and college, but looking back, do you think drama and debate were good training for what you do now", "or was it really just a manifestation of what you were already good at", "no, it\u2019s so interesting to get to be in yours 50s", "i have to say, when i turned 50, i found that \u2013 i\u2019d never cared about birthdays and basically have found every decade to be more interesting than the last \u2013 but this one i didn\u2019t like", "i didn\u2019t like the number 50", "i didn\u2019t like crossing it", "but now that i\u2019m in it, you have certain perspective on your life and i do feel, not that i ever would have planned or foreseen what i do now", "until even a few years before i did it, but it does feel like it pulls on all these threads, all these many things that i did in my life", "what\u2019s interesting to me is that it actually does pull on that drama piece", "you know, i went away to college, i never did that again", "late in life, in what turns out to be, i guess, my big career", "there\u2019s a presentational piece to it, so i\u2019m really grateful for that", "you mentioned college", "i have a lot of friends, many of my closest friends went to brown and i\u2019ve heard you describe it as moving to mars", "yeah", "now, the question that i\u2019d like to pose is if i was to talk to your closest friends and ask them what your super powers are, how would they answer that", "my closest friends in college", "no, your closest friends now, or in college", "because the follow-up question is, were those super powers present in college", "oh, gosh", "it\u2019s such an interesting question", "i did feel like i had moved from one planet, which was my small town in oklahoma, bible belt, to this very different world", "i\u2019ll tell you something interesting", "i ended up spending most of my 20s in divided berlin", "after the wall fell, i got my stasi files", "the german secret service, the stasi, had kept files on me from the time that i went to east germany on a brown exchange program my junior year, which included reports on me from east german students who came to brown through that same exchange program, and then later in the years i spent in berlin", "it\u2019s so fascinating", "it\u2019s like this malevolent observer, malevolent however, kept folders of me in my 20s", "so in my stasi file are all the letters i wrote home to my parents from my semester abroad, all the letters my parents wrote to me, the letters back and forth between me and my boyfriend, and also the observations of these east german graduate students about me at college", "it\u2019s so fascinating", "one day when i\u2019m no longer doing this radio show, i will write this book", "what were some of their observations", "well, it\u2019s suffused with paranoia because they always assumed that i was working for the cia, which is just so ridiculous because 19-year-old college sophomores don\u2019t work for the cia", "so it was like observing me through this lens of paranoia", "they saw me as so competent in a way that i think i didn\u2019t see myself", "one came to brown after knowing me in east germany, where i was just so much in learning mode and soaking-everything-up mode", "i guess that would be one of my super powers, that if i get curious, if i give myself over to an experience, i really give myself over to it and i guess i\u2019m a good learner", "so that was the way they had experienced me full-time that semester i spent there", "then this woman came to brown and she said to her i was like a different person", "she said, \u201cshe knows everyone,\u201d which i never thought of myself", "i never thought of myself as someone who knew everyone", "she saw me as very outgoing and gregarious and a strong personality", "i don\u2019t know", "i look back at my college self, i look back at myself in my 20s, like many of us, i think, and i only remember all the self-doubt and the confusion", "what do you think the principles of good learning are", "by all accounts, and certainly my impression is that you are a fantastic learner", "what do you think the principles of elements of being a good learner are", "i guess two things come to mind", "one is good questions", "what i would also say about that is i think learning is a process, so even if it\u2019s something i\u2019m spending an hour learning about, i\u2019m going to expect that my questions are more refined at the end of that hour than they are at the beginning of that hour", "so it\u2019s being able to formulate good questions going in, but then not just letting your answers or what your understanding be shaped, but letting your questions evolve", "that your questions get better and better", "i guess the other thing about learning, i think, is it kind of gets back to where you and i started about seeing what looks like anger", "seeing what is expressing itself as anger, but understanding that there\u2019s something very more \u2013 being interested and open to knowing that there\u2019s something more complicated and perhaps something quite other, deeper, than what is showing itself on the surface", "that\u2019s a quality of learning that is pushing for that deeper thing, that what\u2019s beneath the surface", "i have always been \u2013 and this is not a good thing \u2013 quick to anger", "i could point to family influences, i could point to all sorts of things to absolve myself of responsibility, but it\u2019s been, in some respects, an aid, a level of aggression, but it\u2019s also been very damaging", "i remember being told a few years ago, and i don\u2019t recall who gave me this advice, but said \u201cdo not ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence.\u201d i\u2019ve since realized that incompetence can be replaced with a lot of things", "busy \u2013 they might just be busy", "just because they gave you a one-line email response to your mini-novella that you sent them doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re spiteful or angry", "maybe they just have ten times more stuff on their plate than you do", "if anger is the emotion that i historically have been quick to, that i\u2019m trying to learn to work with in a more constructive way, what emotion are you quick to", "well, i have to say that i\u2019m a redhead and i also am \u2013 well, i\u2019m going to say this kind of proudly, i don\u2019t act out the way i used to", "but people who\u2019ve known me in other parts of my life would certainly say that i had a huge temper", "i do righteous indignation really well", "i do it less often than i used to", "so brown was just like jet fuel on the fire", "my cousin went to brown, i have so many friends who\u2019ve gone to brown", "i think i probably would\u2019ve been happier there than princeton, quite frankly", "yeah, righteous indignation", "that\u2019s a full-time \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah, i\u2019m good at that", "i think one thing about having children that kind of gets to what you\u2019re talking about is you see how children, if you \u2013 and i think this is interesting because i\u2019ve read your books across the years", "if they haven\u2019t eaten enough or they\u2019re not eating the right things, if they haven\u2019t gotten enough sleep, they get cranky", "they\u2019re miserable", "and it\u2019s all out on the surface", "so much of our bad behavior or the behavior that we look back later and say, oh, i wish i hadn\u2019t done that, it\u2019s also about just these elemental things about being creatures in bodies and being tired and being hungry and not taking care of ourselves", "sometimes we are, a lot of us, we\u2019re tired, we\u2019re stressed out", "but somehow, as we go through life, we get less good at wearing that on the surface and sometimes saying that and stepping back, rather than giving into the fit that might be another way to work out our stress or our tiredness", "this reminds me of an anecdote that was shared with me a few months back, which was that bill clinton, president clinton at the time, when he was having a meeting that would lead to some type of negotiation, the first thing he would do when people came in is ask them if they\u2019d had anything to eat or drink and make sure that they were not thirsty and not hungry before the negotiation", "for myself, at least, i\u2019ve realized, and i would like to talk about some of the depressive periods that you\u2019ve worked through because that is something that i\u2019ve \u2013 i hate to use the word \u201csuffered\u201d from because it makes it seem, i don\u2019t want to seem like i\u2019m victimizing myself or playing the part of the victim \u2013 but something i\u2019ve learned i have to work with", "i\u2019ve noticed that very often when i\u2019m trying to sit down and think my way out of some type of funk and i\u2019m coming up with all sorts of sophisticated or seemingly insightful reasons as to why i\u2019m unhappy at the time or just in a low-energy state, the truth is staring me right in the face", "no, you haven\u2019t eaten for five hours", "i\u2019ll sit there and i\u2019ll journal for ten pages and it\u2019s like, no, idiot, you just need to go have an orange and you\u2019ll be fine", "for yourself, and i know you\u2019ve spoken about this before and written about it, but going through depressions \u2013 and let\u2019s say, i think it was a few years ago that you went through depression \u2013 can you identify or explain for people what triggered or catalyzed that and then what helped you to get over that episode of depression", "i think i probably had my first episode of true depression when i was a sophomore in college", "but nobody had that vocabulary back then", "i used the language with myself that i\u2019d fallen into a black hole", "the way it felt and the way it still looks to me like now, i almost visualize it, is that i clawed my way out of that black hole", "in fact, it was a formative experience that i emerged with a lot of courage and a lot of determination and i set a plan for my life, which included how much sleep i needed every night", "i look back and i think, wow, that was very intelligent because those are the kinds of things that matter", "but also i think that i would say at this point that i know that i think i come by this honestly", "i think my father was depressed, although that never showed on the surface", "i also started at brown, i had never really exercised", "it\u2019s crazy because i\u2019m not that old, but the culture i grew up in, girls didn\u2019t do sports really", "i mean, there were girls who did, but they were unusual", "so i\u2019d never really used my body in that way", "but i started this very faithful practice", "i swam", "everywhere i was in the world for 25 years, and i was a few places in those years", "i swam at least every other day", "looking back, i think that was a form of self-care", "actually, that summer before this major depression set in, i had stopped swimming", "i was doing something else", "i was rollerblading", "but that was a little bit different", "so i changed that", "but i think the big answer is that i had \u2013 i was in my early 30s", "i\u2019d literally led a few lives at that point", "i\u2019d put myself through all this change", "i was always very hard on myself, which got me a long way", "but it was much too hard to be me and i had this career in berlin, being a journalist and being a diplomat and then i\u2019d taken myself away to write a novel, and then i\u2019d gotten married, and i\u2019d lived in england, and then gone to divinity school, and then had a baby and moved to minnesota", "honestly, i think this depression had been waiting a long time to happen", "as is often true of us in life, i think at the moment at which i was kind of settled enough to allow it to happen, it just took over", "i had just started to see a therapist", "i\u2019d always thought of myself as somebody who\u2019d had a happy childhood and would never see a therapist and didn\u2019t need that", "but somewhere in myself i think i got ready for this", "that was really a depression where i stopped being able to sleep at all and all the classic things \u2013 lost 15 pounds for no reason", "eventually, i just went to bed and didn\u2019t get out", "what helped me and i was very fortunate to take well to the medications and to have a great therapist who i saw just once a week", "it was hard for me to afford that therapy at that time", "in fact, a friend helped me afford the therapy", "but for a few years, i saw this person", "i always say i never want to romanticize something like depression", "in the moment that someone is depressed, the last thing i would want to insist or say is that this is good for you, and you will learn from this, and it\u2019s valuable", "i do think that 10 or 20 years later, if we can walk through these things and survive them, i would absolutely say that the course of my life was changed for the better because of what i had to face", "the truths i faced about the ways i was wounded, the pain i was carrying around, the ways i had been so hard on myself, so much harder than i needed to be", "i was able to start living differently, over years", "that\u2019s kind of a long answer, sorry", "this is a long podcast, so long answers are a good fit", "what were some of the changes, if you\u2019re able to talk about them, that you made", "it\u2019s this classic stuff", "again, it\u2019s interesting because i definitely was one of these people who wasn\u2019t sure that i thought \u2013 i wasn\u2019t sure what i thought of anybody who went to therapy", "it was okay for woody allen to do it, right", "guilty as charged over here as well", "yeah, i just thought, that\u2019s not me, i don\u2019t need that", "boy, did i need it", "it\u2019s these classic things of learning how i survived my childhood with a father who didn\u2019t mean to be cruel, but was", "i kept ahead of his sarcasm, i kept ahead of his teasing", "i could get positive approval when i blew him away", "only if i did something that was so smart that he had so not thought of, i would have these moments of it being okay", "so that\u2019s what i did", "i pushed myself really hard and i got through my childhood", "i went to amazing places on that same kind of energy, but it was not a way to live", "it was not a sustainable way to be human", "at that point, in my 30s, if i hadn\u2019t found a way to treat myself more gently, then i think i would\u2019ve just got smaller after that", "i\u2019ve not done a deep dive on this yet, or potentially for myself, and certainly just as an area to explore", "i\u2019ve become very interested in cbt \u2013 cognitive behavioral therapy \u2013 and particularly its roots or at least some of the core tenets being similar to stoicism, which i read constantly, for better or for worse", "i think mostly for better", "i guess for neutral, if we\u2019re talking about stoics", "the type of therapy \u2013 i\u2019ve never done any type of consistent therapy", "i have hired people who would call themselves coaches which may, in fact, offer a very similar support role", "but what type of therapy was it that you found most helpful or what were the characteristics that were helpful", "i just want to say that one of my favorite interviews i did across the years, it was a long time ago now so you probably haven\u2019t seen it, it was with jennifer michael hecht, who is a philosopher and a poet", "she wrote a book on doubt, which is just masterful", "she talks about the origins of stoicism and cynicism", "she talks about them as graceful life philosophies", "we think of them almost as stances against, or neutral", "but anyway, i just want to say i don\u2019t think stoicism is just neutral", "oh, it\u2019s not", "it\u2019s not", "i\u2019m really being facetious because i think that stoicism for most people, brings up the image of a cow standing in the rain or something like that, but it\u2019s much more that", "i\u2019ve done a lot of work with publishing and recommending stoicism as something to explore", "there are many different types of therapy", "for some people, i\u2019ve spoken with friends, for instance, who really just need to talk, but they don\u2019t want to do it with their friends who are biased in one way or another or they feel guilty because their friends have many different things to do", "you go down the list, there a million different variations", "what did you find most helpful", "i didn\u2019t do anything fancy or exciting sounding, like jungian therapy", "i was living in minnesota at the time, as i still am, and i had this just really good therapist who probably, i would say, family systems was where he was coming from", "but i\u2019m not even sure that i knew that language then", "i would say, and i think this was kind of part of my survival stuff from my childhood, is i\u2019m not somebody who ever talked to anybody about any of this", "one thing i\u2019ve invested so much in, and i think that going through my depression and my therapy has opened up this whole part of my life in the last 20 years is investing in my friendships", "it\u2019s not that i didn\u2019t have friends, i did", "but i didn\u2019t lean on people back then", "i think i didn\u2019t think it was safe to", "this was really the first time that i had just told the truth", "i had somebody ask me questions about what it was really like to grow up in my body, in my house", "things that i had never said to myself being the answers", "it\u2019s just unpeeling these layers", "then there\u2019s this terrible moment, which i\u2019m sure everybody gets to", "i don\u2019t know how far in it was, six months or a year, where you peel away enough layers that you\u2019re actually making progress, and you have to do that to get into a new place, but that moment where you\u2019ve learned things about yourself that are hard and true", "you get vulnerable for the first time and you have not yet started to create the foundation for this new way you will live", "i remember that moment in therapy as just despairing, where i just felt like \u2013 and i think i said this to my therapist \u2013 i am damaged goods", "that\u2019s never the way i had allowed myself to think about myself or certainly anybody else to think of me", "but then i don\u2019t know, he kind of helped me walk out of that because that also wasn\u2019t the whole story and the damage part wasn\u2019t all of me", "it kind of helps you live into other places in yourself that you haven\u2019t been able to live into because you were so catering to that fear", "does that make sense", "no, it does make sense and i think there\u2019s also, at least in my own depressive periods, the acute feeling \u2013 and this is not speaking for you, but speaking for myself \u2013 the acute feeling of being alone or uniquely damaged, whereas maybe we can take solace in the fact that we are all dinged up by the full-contact sport that is life", "there are very few people who go through cradle to grave fully intact like a porcelain doll", "it tends not to happen", "you mentioned a few questions and i\u2019d like to talk about questions", "what are the interviews or episodes or experiences that have helped you to grow most as an interviewer", "i don\u2019t know that i\u2019ve thought about that", "honestly, i feel like i\u2019ve grown as an interviewer by doing it", "that sounds really simple and it\u2019s very straightforward and it\u2019s something we know more about through science now, right", "but for me, it\u2019s been a departure", "i can\u2019t believe that i\u2019ve been doing the same thing now for over 12 years, it\u2019s more like 15 years, if you think about the early days when i was creating the show", "i guess doing the same thing over and over again, but in this constant mode of learning", "when i was younger, when i was in my 20s, i would\u2019ve been really resistant to the idea of doing the same thing for a long period of time", "that would\u2019ve felt like stasis to me, kind of not growing anymore", "but i do think that i never thought of myself as an interviewer until i created this job", "i still consider myself to be a newcomer and an interloper in the world of media, which i know is ridiculous at this point", "i\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty ridiculous", "i\u2019m realizing it\u2019s ridiculous because that\u2019s not the way that other people see it", "so i think that clearly, i do feel like i\u2019m doing something i\u2019m good at", "i know how to do this", "i have a good set of skills and instincts that lend themselves to this", "i truly would say that how i\u2019ve gotten better is doing it over and over and over again", "that is such a thrilling thing to get better at something over time", "what were some of the mistakes that you made early on as an interviewer", "i\u2019m still making mistakes, but i can think of a lot of mistakes that i\u2019ve made", "they fall into a handful of categories", "what were mistakes you made early on or common novice mistakes", "i suppose i learned at some point early on that i was better when i could stop", "that i was better when i was really planted in the fact that it wasn\u2019t about me", "that the point of the interview was drawing out this other person when i could get out of the way", "that doesn\u2019t mean i\u2019m an essential person in the interview", "you and i were having that conversation", "i actually think your job right now is harder than my job", "because you are creating this narrative arc", "you\u2019re hosting this experience", "i\u2019m not belittling the role i had to play", "i still had to ask those good questions", "i still had to listen well", "i had to be able to go with the conversation, but as clear as i could get about the fact that it was about them and not about me, i would be better", "i used to have this experience that i would do all these rituals to have good energy", "at some point early on i realized that sometimes when i went into the studio for an interview and i was tired for whatever reason, i hadn\u2019t been able to get to sleep or i hadn\u2019t been able to drink the right amount of caffeine, it was a better experience for me and for them", "that was one of the signals for me", "that when i even by force had to surrender, that actually was part of what made it good", "how did that manifest itself in the conversation", "was it longer pauses, more silence", "was it just a greater degree of focus because you were summoning every ounce of strength that you had after an all-nighter to look them in the face and actually hear their words", "how did that surrendering manifest itself", "i guess it did manifest as a calm", "i was worried about it as tiredness, but it also took an edge of energy off, which, in fact, was helpful to letting the other person\u2019s energy be what drove the conversation", "i think it made me more porous, right", "because i wasn\u2019t able to gear up the way i thought i should", "that, in fact, i was letting more in", "what habits \u2013 i probably should have asked this at the beginning \u2013 what habits of other interviewers annoy you", "i will have to laugh if it\u2019s like four or five things i\u2019ve been doing repeatedly in this conversation", "no, no", "is there anything that \u2013 [crosstalk] i feel like my answers are impolitic", "that\u2019s okay", "there\u2019s a lot", "most of what i see, that\u2019s a big statement", "much of what i see that calls itself interviewing, at least let\u2019s say in news \u2013there\u2019s no many interesting things happening", "there\u2019s so many new platforms and this is one of them", "although i\u2019ll say in podcasting what can happen, because it is so easy \u2013 i mean, i actually had to start a public radio show, which was much harder than it should be", "it took years and it was like being hazed for years", "i can\u2019t even believe it happened because it was so difficult, but that was the only way i could get this thing out there", "that\u2019s not true anymore", "you can start your podcast", "but the danger of that is not to understand that there\u2019s a craft", "not to put any rigor into it", "because there is a craft to creating conversational space that is listenable and it goes somewhere, and that will be affecting for the person who\u2019s being interviewed, as well as the people listening", "anyway, that\u2019s new; that\u2019s a new phenomenon", "even in public radio, which i love, the nature of the experience and of the way things work is that people who we hear at interviewers have been handed a list of questions by producers, which they pose", "then they move on to the next question", "that\u2019s just not a conversation to me", "the interview proceeds without any reference to what\u2019s just been said, for the most part", "it\u2019s something almost scripted", "it\u2019s scripted on their end", "that drives me crazy", "there\u2019s just a lot of lost opportunities for revelation", "i guess the other thing that drives me crazy is that when people are going for revelation, it\u2019s often in the form of making their questions sound tough", "it\u2019s about how they sound, how they present", "we actually reward and laud interviewers who push their subjects into corners and embarrass them", "who put people on the defensive and then they strike out and then that creates the conversation we talk about", "i think that rarely accomplishes anything, aside from something entertaining", "something that demeans both of the people in the conversation and demeans us by enjoying it", "i agree", "i think that it\u2019s adding division to a world that is already divisive enough in a lot of respects", "here\u2019s a bit of a gear shift", "this is a question from one of my dear friends who is a huge fan of your show, as are many people, of course", "he would love to know what you read to your kids or have read to your kids", "well, my kids are now 18 and 21", "right, so before that, when you were reading to them", "i don\u2019t know that i read \u2013 i remember just reading to my kids was just one of the \u2013 well, it was both beautiful and exhausting", "i also remember the nights where they\u2019d say, read me another story and i was like, oh, please, let me go to bed", "but it\u2019s also true that those were such special moments", "but i read margaret wise brown, like goodnight moon and that genre", "i am a huge library user", "i took my kids to the library all the time and we would walk away with stacks and stacks of books", "more than buying books", "i didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend when they were really little", "i would just say we read everything", "what i also did as my kids got older is that i would read \u2013 when they were a little bit too old for the children\u2019s books but liked being read to at night, even just to fall asleep, i would read new yorker articles or pieces from the new york times book review that were just educational and enjoyable", "i really liked that period when they allowed me to do that", "i\u2019m going to sprinkle in questions from fans of yours and fans of mine as we go through this", "this is another fan question", "i\u2019m paraphrasing, in part, but trimming them down in some cases", "\u201ci appreciated her interviews with mary oliver and poets", "what are the top three poems she\u2019d recommend?\u201d i\u2019ll just rephrase this a little bit", "for someone who is allergic to poetry or has never viewed themselves as liking poetry for whatever reason, maybe they just had a bad teacher or a bad day in school, what are three poems or poets that you would suggest they start with", "i have to say i think that\u2019s a daunting question because i probably won\u2019t give the best answer", "i do interview so many poets these days", "i meet people who tell me they discovered poetry through my show and that just thrills me", "but honestly, i\u2019m just like everybody else and poetry has eluded my attention for a lot of my life", "i love it and yet it kind of hurts going in", "i have to force myself to read it", "so i think i\u2019m fortunate to be in this position where i get paid to draw out \u2013 to go sit with mary oliver and soak up poetry", "what comes to mind, these are just the three poems that come to mind right now", "i mean, i do actually think mary oliver\u2019s poem, wild geese, is incredible", "it\u2019s a poem that has saved lives", "there\u2019s a line in there that actually comes to me at interesting times", "it\u2019s not unrelated to some of the things you and i have been talking about, \u201clet the soft animal of your body love what it loves,\u201d and sometimes that such an important thing to be able to tell ourselves", "that\u2019s beautiful", "it is beautiful", "another poem that i found really important this year", "i interviewed a poet named naomi shihab nye", "you know what", "i literally just pulled up her name because i was going to mention her", "please continue", "so she has this poem called kindness, which she wrote after she was, she may have even been on her honeymoon", "she was with her husband", "i think they were in colombia", "something happened", "they were robbed", "i mean, they had this really traumatizing experience", "she\u2019s in a different country, sitting by the side of the road, her husband takes off to find help", "she actually wrote this poem called kindness about what happened after that experience", "it\u2019s a reminder, it\u2019s just beautiful", "it tells a story", "but it\u2019s also lines that you can carry around with you that are a reminder that we each of us have so much power in any given day to make the day of a lot of people", "there\u2019s so many things for us to feel powerless about, but that\u2019s huge", "i like it and it\u2019s about kindness, but it\u2019s unromantic", "there\u2019s nothing fluffy, touchy-feely about it", "i guess the other thing i\u2019d just recommend is a book", "rilke is probably the name, if there\u2019s one name of somebody that\u2019s not alive that\u2019s come up more often in my show, most often, it\u2019s probably rilke", "there\u2019s a translation of his book of hours, which is called book of hours: love letters to god", "it\u2019s translated by a buddhist teacher named joanna macy, and a friend of hers who\u2019s also buddhist, who\u2019s a psychotherapist named anita barrows", "i\u2019ve interviewed both of them across the years", "rilke\u2019s german", "i lived in germany for seven years", "for some bizarre reason, there\u2019s part of my brain that is in german", "i\u2019m very fluent in german", "rilke\u2019s german is exquisitely beautiful", "there\u2019s no relation to the kind of guttural german that is in all of our ears from movies", "it\u2019s almost like he has his own language", "joanna and anita have translated, have turned that into english", "it\u2019s a book that i return to again and again, the poems in there", "given that you speak both languages, you feel like it captures the essence of rilke\u2019s german", "i do, but it does it \u2013 i\u2019ve never been happy with any of the translations of rilke, any of the others out there", "there\u2019s one translator of his letters to a young poet that i like, which is an older translator \u2013 herter norton", "but this poetry, it\u2019s a creative work", "they have not tried to translate every word as it appears", "they have done something creative and that veers away from the text in a way that captures what it really does in another language", "i\u2019ll have to check that out", "we won\u2019t get into it, but i lived in berlin for a while myself in 2005", "you did", "when was that", "this was 2005", "i lived in prenzlauer berg for about three months and spent a bit of time in east berlin for boxing", "it was incredible, even at that time, how different when you crossed the line, architecturally and just culturally, everything was different", "i had a fantastic time", "german, unfortunately for me, maybe it\u2019s due to the noun cases and whatnot, but it is the one language that i lose like sand through the fingers faster than any other", "it\u2019s really a shame because i love the language, but can\u2019t win them all", "so a few things i want to mention", "so naomi shihab nye was the first poet and i was introduced to her through a friend who felt compelled, for whatever reason, this doesn\u2019t happen to me often, to read a poem to me", "i thought when i read her work, oh, i can actually understand this", "because in previous encounters with poetry, my overwhelming thought was \u2013 and it was often presented in an academic environment where the more incomprehensible it was, the more valuable it would seem and i just didn\u2019t get it", "there\u2019s another book that i picked up a year ago", "i\u2019ve been trying to focus less on being obsessed with productivity all the time and part of that is trying to focus on beauty that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a point, for the sake of beauty", "i love that", "that was one of my learning curves [inaudible]", "yeah, like that last 5 percent", "i\u2019m still working on it", "yeah, it\u2019s like that last 5 percent that\u2019s going to make you a miserable wretch and may be not worth it", "so i picked up this book because of the title, which i don\u2019t do that often, but a very thin book of poetry called night sky with exit wounds", "i just loved the imagery that conjured", "i will warn people, it is very sexually graphic, so if you\u2019re sensitive to that, be aware", "who\u2019s the \u2013 ocean vuong", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m pronouncing the vietnamese last name properly, but v-u-o-n-g", "really thin and i committed to reading one poem per day in the morning", "yeah, that\u2019s good", "which i\u2019m doing right now with the tao te ching, which is the book that probably is in the top four that have come up most often in my own podcast", "you mentioned love letters to god and i\u2019d like to talk about language for a second", "the word \u201cgod\u201d is tricky for a lot of reasons, as you are well familiar", "i\u2019m not going to focus on that right now", "i will ask \u2013 this is actually a question from a fan \u2013 if you were to choose one word, common or uncommon, which is most important to humanity, what would it be", "that\u2019s a huge question, but i\u2019ll let you take us \u2013 obviously, it would not be god", "yeah, or important for us in this modern epoch", "the word \u201cgod\u201d is too small and it\u2019s too overused and misused", "i don\u2019t know, honestly i\u2019d probably say something that might sound cheesy because it\u2019s another overused word, but i think the word \u201clove\u201d is \u2013 i\u2019ve been writing and talking a lot about this over the last couple of years", "that the word \u201clove\u201d is so watered down and ruined and yet, it\u2019s just the only thing big enough if we can recapture it in all of its complexity for our life together", "and again if we can recapture it as something practical and not merely romantic", "passionate", "i think we need to get the passion to it", "love is kind of an amazing word because even though it is completely ruined \u2013 just yesterday, i interviewed alain de botton about love and sex and marriage, this philosopher", "we talk all the time about the language of falling", "that it\u2019s usually something you fall into and fall out of", "and yet, there\u2019s only usually one way to say i love you", "those are some of the most incredible words and the most affecting words that any of us can ever hear at any moment", "i think even though it\u2019s ruined, that might be my choice if i had to choose one", "i have had \u2013 and maybe this is from, i blame it on the language learning and having studied whatever it is, spanish, japanese, chinese, etc., that i get very anxious \u2013 maybe this is just also my ocd at work \u2013 amorphous or nebulous words", "if something\u2019s not well-defined for me, i don\u2019t like to use it", "i\u2019ve avoided using a lot of words whenever possible", "\u201csuccess\u201d i don\u2019t like to use very much, or \u201csuccessful.\u201d i do the same thing", "there are lots of words that are just messed up", "what other words do you try not to use or do you think people should use less", "i do this all the time, but of course now you\u2019re asking me and i \u2013 we can come back to it too", "i actually think \u2013 i work a lot with words like \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cprivilege.\u201d we\u2019re just doing a show on whiteness", "some of the things that we need to have big conversations about together and actually just have to start with baby steps", "we\u2019re so far from knowing how to have certain conversations, especially around race", "but i think the whiteness conversation, even among white people, is a big one", "we\u2019ve loaded down \u2013 there are these words and these phrases that are attached to those conversations that just are conversation stoppers", "definitely", "that are very meaningful for the people who are using them, that have a lineage and have substance, but elicit immediate, defensive reactions, are immediately polarizing to the extent that they are counterproductive", "i feel like there\u2019s a whole lot of that around race", "even words like \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cjustice,\u201d i don\u2019t use words like that", "i like to talk about social healing, rather than social activism", "a lot of words we use that we act like have inherently positive connotations like \u201cinnovation\u201d or \u201cprogress,\u201d don\u2019t, right", "i mean, there\u2019s a lot of things we do in the name of progress and innovation which are impulsive or which are so bounded by what we can see at the moment, that are going to have terrible effects 20 years from now", "i think the best example of this is what we did with food in the latter half of the 20th century and how when i was growing up, my mother being able to make dinner by opening a box and a can was progress", "in fact, we have just systematically messed up our bodies, our agriculture and our planet", "i think we need to be really wary", "\u201csuccess\u201d is a good one, you\u2019re right", "especially about these words that we kind of reflexively think are good", "we need to question a lot of that", "we need to be more thoughtful", "or even happiness can fall into that category", "terrible", "yeah, i don\u2019t think happiness is a word i use very much", "flourishing", "i like that word", "i want to mention a few things", "the first is that the same friends, or i should say one of the friends, matt mullenweg, who\u2019s just a brilliant entrepreneur, a very thoughtful, soulful guy who\u2019s thought of typically as the lead developer of wordpress [inaudible]", "i know, he\u2019s amazing", "i\u2019ve been so honored that he \u2013 i think he quoted me in his speech", "it\u2019s so amazing", "he\u2019s a big fan and his new year\u2019s resolution assignment to me was to have you on the podcast", "i\u2019ve given him his own new year\u2019s resolution, which explains the twitter back and forth with him to do a silent retreat", "but he introduced me to a book years ago, and i believe it\u2019s called words that work, and it\u2019s by frank luntz", "i believe he was a republican political strategist", "putting any partisan feelings aside, it really underscores the importance of the words you use and how the words you use affect or perhaps just are your thinking and then that, of course, affects everything else", "it\u2019s so critical \u2013 i mean, you mentioned the whiteness episode", "you should have a thumbnail of my head", "i look like american history x", "i\u2019m the palest human you\u2019ve ever seen", "but putting my hair loss issues aside, i\u2019ve found that \u2013 and i won\u2019t spend too much time on this, but it\u2019s a very worrisome or worrying trend that i\u2019m observing which is, in say a conversation about race, there is a tremendous and i think it\u2019s both self-induced and contributed to by outside factors", "i mean, i can\u2019t do a q&a anywhere without getting some scoffing comment about white privileged male and it shuts down the conversation", "there\u2019s so much self-loathing among, for instance, people who are white and that is a really broad category", "i mean, they could be recent immigrants from albania", "they could be fill-in-the-blank", "but i do think it\u2019s important to realize that if you \u2013 and this comes back to the point you made about interviewing \u2013 if you immediately put someone on the defense and shut them down, even though you might get the cheap applause for that, it is not in the long term constructive and, in fact, i think it\u2019s very \u2013 it sows the seed of later destruction in many ways", "that\u2019s right", "all right", "shifting gears", "getting off of hardball with chris matthews", "let\u2019s move to eastern practices and philosophies, just to temper it", "this is a question from a fan", "\u201csometimes i find eastern practices to be demotivating", "how can you reconcile zen and striving for success?\u201d this is a sentiment that i\u2019ve heard a lot of type-a folks, myself included, talk about amongst friends related to even meditation", "like i\u2019m afraid i\u2019m going to lose my edge, type of concerns", "how do you think about that", "well, i do want to say one thing", "i think also it\u2019s like zen \u2013 you can be an incredible mediator and be very narcissistic, right", "so first of all, it\u2019s not like any of these things magically change you or make you a better person", "putting that aside \u2013 i\u2019m meditating to become more narcissistic", "am i doing it wrong", "that\u2019s another conversation", "honestly, i think i\u2019m like them", "i think that i, as i say, i get a lot done", "i personally, even after i started to vicariously benefit greatly from the conversations with buddhists and contemplatives, just couldn\u2019t do it myself, which is crazy because \u2013 as i was saying to somebody recently, mediating is, in fact, one of life\u2019s few instantaneously rewarding activities", "i have had across the years just these one-off experiences of putting myself in that place or being in a setting where i was put in that place", "it is transformative", "even in some ways that stay with you", "and yet, i could not force myself to keep doing it every day", "i guess one thing i would say, i think this matter of spiritual practice and what spiritual practice works for us, it gets to be personal", "we are different", "what actually changed for me, i at some point decided \u2013 again, even though i\u2019d had these amazing experiences and utterly believe in that, it\u2019s just not for me", "it\u2019s when i started doing yoga that i started to let this into my life", "what i told myself and this, i think, true, but it\u2019s also kind of my narrative, is that it needed to be active", "i needed my body to be moving to calm my mind down", "i do a very athletic kind of yoga and i love that", "i will say that very gradually, i have held these spiritual technologies in high regard", "i have continued to speak with teachers", "i\u2019ve continued to have these one-off experiences", "i have very gradually developed a really modest practice", "i spend 10 minutes every morning, and that\u2019s up from 6 last year", "that\u2019s while my tea steeps", "so i\u2019m even killing two birds with one stone", "it has calmed me down", "i think i was ready to be calmed down", "it will change you", "i think whether it takes your edge off depends on how much in charge you are of how you\u2019re moving through the world to begin with", "i think it also, at least where i\u2019ve landed, not everything needs to have an edge", "so if you\u2019re looking for a scalpel to cut something effectively, yes, you want an edge", "but if you\u2019re trying to sleep, you don\u2019t want to lay on a bed of razor blades", "i\u2019ve also noticed oftentimes, for me at least, having only meditated consistently for the last two or three years, that it allows me to be more observant of my own thoughts and therefore more precisely determine what i need and want so that i\u2019m not using an edge to charge through brick walls in a direction that i don\u2019t need to be heading in the first place", "right", "one of the things that i find really fascinating is how it changes one\u2019s experience of time", "i\u2019ve thought a lot over the years \u2013 i know from my conversations with scientists and from the study i did of einstein, that time is an illusion", "the way we\u2019re experiencing it is the way our senses are experiencing it", "for example, we walk around with some illusions", "as you\u2019re saying, that certain things are a certain way and we have to manage them that way, that, in fact, aren\u2019t reality-based", "i used to \u2013 and i think this is very much the question you\u2019re asking \u2013 i get a huge amount done in the first hour to hour and a half that i\u2019m awake in the morning", "i\u2019m a little bit ocd about my email inbox and i can\u2019t stand for it to be more than one screen", "i have to act on everything before i can get rid of it", "but i\u2019m on top of a lot of things", "but the way i used to work is that i\u2019d get up early and i would just be clearing through correspondence", "my colleagues would get into the office and their inboxes would be full of all this stress from me", "what i had told myself forever is this is how i got everything done", "this is how i stayed on top of all these jobs i\u2019m doing because i was productive", "then when i committed myself to sitting quietly before i opened my inbox, before i did anything like that, i didn\u2019t get as much done before 7:00 in the morning, but it all got done, right", "right", "this was a strange feeling", "that i felt i was, by some measure, less productive, but that did not mean that there wasn\u2019t time in the day and it was much less stressful and it was less stressful for the people on the other end of my emails", "then there\u2019s also the question of, what are you being productive for", "if it\u2019s to improve your quality of life on some level, then you are, in fact, being more productive by being less productive, if that makes any sense", "yeah, right", "here\u2019s a question", "i think it reinforces for me the importance of defining one particular word", "this may be what you just described, so you don\u2019t have to repeat that if that\u2019s the case", "but one of the fan questions is, what can one do daily to begin a small but marked increase in spiritual awareness", "i\u2019d like to pose that question, but i\u2019d also like you to define \u201cspiritual\u201d for us because this is one of the words that i\u2019ve dodged myself for the most part", "living in san francisco, you can only imagine how many different ways this word is used", "you can barely walk down the street without tripping over a didgeridoo and someone doing acroyoga and so on", "how would you define spiritual and then if you\u2019d like to take a stab at this question, what someone could do daily to begin a small but marked increase in spiritual awareness", "well, i think practices are important and i do think that everybody gets to find what works for them, what works for their personality type, what works for their life", "it\u2019s the same thing if you\u2019re talking about prayer", "there are a lot of people who pray, but there are so many forms of doing that and they don\u2019t all work for everyone", "what i think is important in human life that our spiritual traditions have always known is ritual", "in a way, what we\u2019re talking about, you could say that your meditation practice is also a form of ritual", "it\u2019s setting aside time when you are recollecting yourself", "now we know from science, you\u2019re also calming yourself", "you\u2019re doing all these great things for your wellbeing on every level", "what i would want to say, also, about beginning a spiritual practice, i think ritual is really critical because i just think as creatures we need it too", "it\u2019s a human need and spiritual life benefits from that", "but also i don\u2019t like to think of spiritual life as a compartment of life", "i think that it\u2019s how you move through your days", "i think those rituals actually can help you internalize that", "it\u2019s as much about how you are present to whatever you are doing", "that\u2019s also spiritual practice", "then something else i would say about that is it\u2019s not about being perfect", "but it is about intentionality and it\u2019s about forgiving yourself and it\u2019s about being gentle with yourself and others", "it\u2019s a gentle thing", "it doesn\u2019t have to be something that you could wear on your sleeve", "one of the conversations i\u2019ve had with sylvia borstein, who\u2019s a jewish buddhist teacher and talks about spirituality can be folding the towels sweetly, right", "some of the great mystics, brother lawrence wrote this book, the practice of the presence of god and he talked about washing the dishes as an act of prayer", "th\u00edch nh\u1ea5t h\u1ea1nh does that too", "how you wash the dishes", "so that\u2019s important", "then the final thing i would say that is actually included in those kinds of ways of being that i just mentioned, is that it\u2019s embodied, it\u2019s bodily \u2013 at this point in my life, i\u2019m really not very interested in anything that is merely spiritual", "it\u2019s doing yoga, getting into my body, and also it\u2019s in our bodies that we encounter other human beings", "this has deepened my spiritual life as much as any other technically spiritual activity", "part of this is about us giving ourselves permission to see what is ordinary as spiritual practice", "that is a real relief", "if you couldn\u2019t use the word \u201cspiritual,\u201d would it be a combination then of empathy, presence", "i\u2019m just wondering what the components are", "yeah, it\u2019s a good question", "for instance, i\u2019m thinking of a very good friend of mine, sam harris, certainly controversial but very well-spoken and very thoughtful in many respects", "he has an extremely well-developed meditative practice", "he\u2019s very present when you talk to him", "i think he is able to enjoy the small things", "from that perspective, he checks a lot of the boxes, but he\u2019s certainly a non-believer when it comes to religion and would consider himself an atheist more so than spiritual, but is he spiritual", "i guess it depends on how we define it", "i\u2019m just curious what words you might use that are the pre-conditions or the components of that", "again, it can be a very personal definition", "i\u2019m just wondering how you [inaudible]", "spirituality is one of these words that i try not to overuse because it is amorphous", "i also think you can\u2019t avoid it", "i know that for people who are atheist or agnostic, you find different degrees of comfort with the spirituality language", "let me just say this, i don\u2019t think that anybody stops having a spiritual life because of the absence of a belief in god", "i think an atheist can have a spiritual life and i think every atheist i know has a spiritual life", "i also acknowledge that some of them wouldn\u2019t like that language, and i would honor that", "it\u2019s not about faith", "i would say inner life, interior life is one way to approach it", "that doesn\u2019t quite get at spiritual, but it gets pretty close to me", "and again, there are many ways of doing inner life and interior life as there are people", "for sure", "here\u2019s a different question, which is \u2013 this is from a fan \u2013 what do you think about the notion that wisdom comes with age", "if so, how can we become wise beyond our years", "i think wisdom does not necessarily come with age", "some people get old and wise and some people just get old", "i\u2019d love to hear how you define it", "i mentioned sam", "sam has jokingly said before that wisdom in some capacity \u2013 i\u2019m paraphrasing \u2013 is learning to follow your own advice", "something along those lines, which i liked quite a bit", "but, yeah", "how do you think of this", "about a definition of wisdom", "yeah", "i want to say that to me, wisdom \u2013 to me, every stage of life, there\u2019s a capacity for wisdom at many different stages of any life, i think", "so yes, there is something very special about a person who has lived a long time and accumulated wisdom by way of experience, the fullness of the human experience", "by how they have moved through that and what they\u2019ve internalized and they\u2019ve moved through", "what they\u2019ve integrated into their wholeness", "how they\u2019ve integrated what has gone wrong into their wholeness",

"i think there are these flashes of wisdom at different stages of life and that it is something that\u2019s accessible that we can practice and aspire to", "like we practice and aspire to other skills", "how i define it contradicts that a little bit", "because usually \u2013 and it\u2019s interesting because i wrote a whole book about wisdom without defining wisdom", "as soon as i was out talking about the book, this is one of the first questions people would ask me, how do you define wisdom", "and i realized i\u2019d never done that", "you could say there was a few hundred pages about it, but what i think distinguishes wisdom from knowledge or accomplishment or intelligence \u2013 i think a wise person can have all those things, but it\u2019s not a position", "it\u2019s not like you look at someone as they are smart, they are intelligent, they are accomplished", "the measure of wisdom is the imprint a life makes on other lives, on the world around it", "[with a wise person, it\u2019s almost something that\u2019s palpable", "it\u2019s something you can see", "that\u2019s kind of where i\u2019ve come with the definition", "i like that", "i\u2019m jumping from one big concept to another, but i think these are worth exploring, so here\u2019s a question", "\u201ckrista herself is very calming, very good at finding meaning", "can you ask her how she does it", "how does she consistently see the best and most meaningful things in the world around her?\u201d this is something, just out of pure self-interest i\u2019d love to hear you answer, because i can sometimes get so trapped with blinders on that i find it difficult to see the best and most meaningful things in the world around me", "so i\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts", "well, i don\u2019t want to burst anyone\u2019s bubble", "i mean, what people\u2019s experience of me are these very intense containers in which i\u2019m fully present to another human being and have immersed myself in who they are", "i am there to absolutely draw out the best of them, to help them put words around something maybe they can\u2019t put words around, and that we\u2019re all present while that happens", "now, i\u2019m going to be kind to myself and i\u2019m going to say that at this point in my life, i am actually getting to the point where i live that way a lot of the time", "that i couldn\u2019t have said that for the first 50 years", "really, the short answer to that question is practice", "at some point, about 15 years ago, i started walking in this direction", "i was fortunate to create this job that allows me to do this with an intensity and a primacy in my life", "but i don\u2019t think you have to have this job to be doing this", "i keep putting myself in this position and anytime you keep putting yourself in a certain place, in a certain position, practicing certain things year after year, it changes you and this has changed me", "what is the position that someone else could put themselves in if they wanted a homework assignment", "i think you could do this", "you can do this in terms of how you interact with your colleagues in the workplace", "it\u2019s one of the things adam grant writes about, right", "givers in the workplace change everybody", "i also know \u2013 and this is just as true across my career as anybody else\u2019s, that the workplace can be one of the most stressful places", "i always wanted to do a show \u2013 we were a part of a big media organization until three years ago", "i always wanted to do a radio show called \u201cthe problem of evil in the workplace,\u201d which i thought evil is so much greater and workplace \u2013 that was much more devastating than whatever \u2013 of my fear of earthquakes or fires", "where you work, where you live, with your children, with your family, becoming a neighbor in a different way", "i feel like the great challenge that is before us now as a country is to figure out what common life means, to reimagine it", "i think we actually have to reinvent it", "i think even if our political life weren\u2019t so fractured, we\u2019d have to reinvent it and maybe this is one reason our political life is so fractured", "it\u2019s just not going to look like the same thing in the 21st century as it did in the latter half of the 20th century", "that is about, in very practical ways, getting to know our neighbors who have become strangers", "that is a calling for now", "any time any of us do that, in whatever small way in our communities, that is practicing presence and practicing real curiosity", "working on asking better questions", "caring to find out details and nuance and complexity", "those are ways to talk about what i do in this work i do", "and also not to respond too quickly to statements", "another quote of yours that i like and you can correct me if i\u2019m getting this wrong, but \u201ci can disagree with your opinion, it turns out, but i can\u2019t disagree with your experience.\u201d i think there\u2019s so many problems in this world, in this country certainly because people confuse the two", "if someone is telling you a factual recounting of something that happened to them that is very different from saying \u201ci think you should,\u201d or providing an opinion", "those are two very different things", "keeping that in mind is very helpful to mitigate overreacting emotionally to other people", "in, i suppose the stoic sense that is very practical and applicable, less than the trying to remain spock at all times", "i\u2019ve really found that quote of yours, that concept at least, very helpful to think about", "experience and opinion, those are two different things", "so you can provide your experience without, also and even preface it, and i\u2019ve done this before, and say \u201ci can only comment on my personal experience", "i don\u2019t want to give you a bunch of opinions, but here\u2019s been my experience", "this is what has happened to me,\u201d or something along those lines", "it diffuses a lot of these potentially volatile situations", "yeah, it humanizes", "we have all these ways we think we know each other", "we think we know what each other are about and they have to do with positions and issues, right", "or how somebody voted", "we don\u2019t know each other on a human level", "i\u2019ve been thinking since the election about i learned, i started my vision for doing this and kind of a bit of my methodology started in this project", "i did it for some benedictine monks back in the late \u201890s", "they were ecumenicist, which when they started doing it was a completely revolutionary thing", "i\u2019m going to plead ignorance here", "can you define that for me", "what", "ecumenism", "yes, please", "well, it was like inter-christian, interdenominational conversation which we forget that in the 1960s, it was absolutely radical when catholics and protestants started talking to each other",

of your life", "which actually you still got to really big, heady places in the discussion, but you humanized it as you got there", "i\u2019ve been thinking since the election, i think this would work", "i don\u2019t know how it would be structured, but what if we could create these experiences where people got together in trustworthy spaces where they could be safe, they were safe, and you had people start talking about why did you vote for donald trump", "or why did you vote for hillary clinton", "answer the question through the story of your life", "then we would actually start talking about eventually the things we need to start talking about", "including economics and our children\u2019s futures and the fact that we have a shared stake in all of our children\u2019s futures", "i\u2019m glad you brought that up because it\u2019s a very \u2013 i didn\u2019t ever put this together because i hadn\u2019t heard you say that before, but it\u2019s also intensely practical to say \u201canswer the question through the story and experience of your life,\u201d because it has full context", "it\u2019s not abstract", "and, in fact, there\u2019s an organization called the entrepreneurs organization, and they have chapters all over the country and regional and city-wide groups of entrepreneurs who want to help one another", "i\u2019m going to probably going to get this slightly off", "i\u2019ve spoken at a number of eo events, but i\u2019m not a member myself", "since i live in the silicon valley, i can\u2019t escape entrepreneurs", "but the rules, as i remember them, are that the group, the chapter is split into what i think are called forums, which are groups of say four to five people", "i\u2019m sure my fans will correct me if i\u2019m getting this wrong", "but when someone in the forum, that is your social accountability group and primary cohort, when someone asks a question, \u201chey i\u2019m trying to figure out how to franchise in this following state, what should i do?\u201d or \u201ci\u2019m trying to solve this particular problem with hiring or annoying public\u201d or fill-in-the-blank", "you cannot use conjecture in answering the question", "you can only answer the question through a story or experience that is from your personal life", "yeah, that\u2019s it", "that\u2019s the same thing, yeah", "the only thing \u2013 so it\u2019s very practical", "it\u2019s something anybody could do", "the only thing that we have to create that we don\u2019t have now is we don\u2019t \u2013 and this is a big order \u2013 is space and time", "we would need to create to somehow spaces, as i say, that are trustworthy, where it would be reasonable to invite people in and expect them to show some vulnerability and tell some truth", "it wouldn\u2019t actually be reasonable to ask people to do that in most of our political spaces, in a lot of our public spaces now", "that\u2019s something we\u2019d have to make happen", "also, time", "because like with these monks, with these gatherings in collegeville, they would have five days", "everybody would spend 45 minutes or an hour answering that question on the first day", "then that was an incredible foundation", "it\u2019s hard for the next few days", "it\u2019s hard to imagine us carving out that kind of time and space, but we could figure this out if we wanted to", "i think also going into thinking about these larger, polarizing issues with the expectation that the conversations are going to be very uncomfortable", "that none of the biggest problems you\u2019ll face in your own life, in the lives of others as a community, a country, fill-in-the-blank, are going to be comfortable", "when you have these stakes involved, if i could implore anyone listening to this to do one thing, certainly in the u.s", "and elsewhere, is to regularly practice exposing yourself to uncomfortable conversations so that you can get better at navigating them without vilifying the other person or emotionally overreacting", "it requires practice, just like negotiation, just like playing tennis, just like anything else", "if you wait for the big topic, whether it\u2019s some aspect of race or otherwise, to debut your conversational skills with discomfort, you\u2019re going to make huge mistakes that are going to be counterproductive and probably destructive", "krista tippett:yeah, and the other thing that i think goes along with that is question the reflexes you have about how you walk into those encounters and what you\u2019re going to talk about", "because we have all these kind of dead-end, built-in instincts about the debate we will have or how we will present or defend our positive or be advocates or change someone\u2019s mind", "or we go in with all kinds of assumptions about them", "i really don\u2019t think this is rocket science, but part of what we have to work through are all the instincts we\u2019re carrying that don\u2019t serve us well", "this is connected to that, if you want to talk to people across difference, you probably don\u2019t start with that, right", "we just think we have to do everything head-on", "we\u2019re americans, we have to accomplish something", "we\u2019ve got an hour here", "so i\u2019ll tell you one of the most helpful stories", "i think a good model for this is i was in iowa the week after the election and there was this woman who talked to me about how she and a group of parents who she knows, who are pretty much split down the middle in terms of who they voted for in the election, share a concern about the effect that the corrosive public speech and the corrosive public campaign had on their children, their children\u2019s imaginations", "they were gathering across these divides of politics with this shared entry point of all of them caring about their children", "whoever they voted for, being able to have this really constructive conversation that was meaningful to all of them about what they\u2019re going to teach their children, how they\u2019re going to talk to them", "the realities they want to create moving forward", "i think you can get really far down the road with that without ever having to talk about why you voted for who you voted for, and yet it creates a possibility of relationship, which creates all kinds of other possibilities", "kind of coming at this from a sideways direction", "absolutely", "i think that sometimes the most directly impactful approach is the oblique approach", "yeah, the slant", "coming at a slant", "one of the things that helped me a lot to navigate my own emotions so that i could less trigger other people\u2019s emotions, so it\u2019s a win/win, was radical \u2013 still is, i re-read this book on a fairly regular basis \u2013 radical acceptance by tara brach", "i read that", "i found it hugely helpful for me, personally", "what books, other than your own, have you gifted the most to other people", "i have gifted that rilke book", "and who are the authors again", "this was love letters to god", "it\u2019s joanna macy, m-a-c-y, and anita barrows", "it\u2019s rilke\u2019s book of hours and the subtitle is love poems to god", "i have gifted pema ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n\u2019s when things fall apart", "that\u2019s kind of a sacred text that i carry around with me at all times because things are always falling apart", "that\u2019s a book i feel like i can pick up anywhere at any moment and read a paragraph and it will be redemptive", "i also love rilke\u2019s letters to a young poet", "i give that to young people", "it\u2019s not really about poetry", "it\u2019s about life and there\u2019s some wonderful things in there about love and the facile understanding of love that we walk around with and the idea of giving yourself time to grow up and grow into what love can be", "that\u2019s a good selection", "at other times in my life, i gave away all the books i loved and as a result, i don\u2019t have many books", "if you were giving the opportunity or maybe the assignment to each a lecture, a seminar, it\u2019s an ongoing class with either college freshman or college seniors, which would you choose and what would you teach", "i\u2019m sorry, college freshmen or college seniors", "right", "gosh, i don\u2019t know how i would choose", "i do spend a lot of time with people that age", "i love it", "i guess i would choose college seniors just because i think you\u2019re so much under formation in those years and still as a college senior", "what would i teach", "they\u2019re growing up into this world of disarray now", "i don\u2019t know if this is a teaching subject, but i\u2019m thinking a lot about the narrative that we all walk around internalizing and working with, which is the narrative we receive from whatever was in the new york times today, whatever was in the headlines of npr or whatever our chosen media is, buzzfeed or whatever it is we\u2019re reading", "how that is not the whole story and how when we walk around too shaped by that narrative, it\u2019s overwhelming", "it actually is very paralyzing", "it does not tell or give people to work with other realities, like generative realities", "that the things that are actually saving us, the things that are growing us up", "focusing on that and focusing on a long view of time, as opposed to this 24/7 instant view of time, which makes us small", "taking seriously, treating as a data point the beautiful and noble people and projects you see around you", "it doesn\u2019t refute the hard things that are happening, but it\u2019s also true", "what exercises might you have those students do or readings that you would assign to help them with this", "i would just want them to get a big view of time", "to see this as a moment within a much larger canvas of time and to see what we internalize as the news, which we too often internalize as the whole of \u2013 kind of a snapshot of reality", "to be able to create some skills to put all of that into perspective and to ask what might really be important that we\u2019re not talking about", "i don\u2019t know", "if i had to teach skills, i suppose, which is really your question, i think these days i would love to do \u2013 and i didn\u2019t do a creative course, but udemy did something through acumen which, of course, is listening in conversation", "i would love to teach just about the art of conversation, the practice of listening, the practical tools, as well as the kind of presence, the intentionality that needs to go into that", "these are practical skills", "i think listening is a basic social art", "it\u2019s not just that we have to relearn them and we have to kind of learn things, except that we have very actively learned work against them", "we\u2019ve all really been trained in the tools of advocacy, representing our positive and we need those skills, but we actually need to retire them also", "we need to dampen those as reflexively as the only things we know how to do", "i think that could be fun", "the art of asking better questions", "absolutely", "the quality of our questions determining the questions of our lives, as tony robbins would say, i think it\u2019s reflected not only in the questions that you ask others, but the questions you ask yourself, which is part of the beauty of what\u2019s been so fun about slowly trying to strengthen my bambi legs and interviewing myself is becoming better at asking questions in my own head", "who are some of the best listeners you know or have known", "sometimes people say to me, \u201cyou\u2019re a professional listener", "you must have grown up with great listeners.\u201d but i\u2019m the other story", "i\u2019m the story of the person who grew up surrounded by people who didn\u2019t listen", "in the absence of that, i felt i needed it", "i didn\u2019t grow up with a lot of models", "while there are certainly many good journalists and hosts, as i say, i don\u2019t really take my models from traditional media", "the good listeners i know are not famous people", "that\u2019s okay; they don\u2019t have to be famous", "they\u2019re my friend, mel, who\u2019s in her 80s, who is just one of the wisest people i know and one of the dearest people i know, and the person who encouraged me to work on this project that sounded pretty farfetched when i first had the idea", "she really cares", "she\u2019s really curious", "she\u2019s also a joyful person", "that joy is infectious", "she\u2019s a great listener", "do you have any favorite documentaries or movies", "i\u2019m so bad at these questions about favorites", "everything goes out of my mind", "in fact, a lot of people ask me what was my favorite interview", "in fact, i just had this exchange about a week ago, where i was a little bit frosty with somebody because they said, \u201cwho\u2019s your favorite interview this ever?\u201d i said, \u201ci can\u2019t choose", "i love them all.\u201d or \u201cwho was your favorite interview this year?\u201d i always say, \u201cmy favorite interview was the last one i did.\u201d they said, \u201cyou\u2019re being very diplomatic.\u201d no, i\u2019m not being diplomatic; it\u2019s true", "i would say my favorite movie would probably be the last one i watched, except i watch a lot more tv than movies these days", "i love how we\u2019re relearning storytelling and doing it well on tv", "there\u2019s some incredible writing and otherwise on tv", "what do are you watching currently or what\u2019s the last memorable tv show that you watched", "i think i watched a lot of things i love this summer", "i loved the night manager", "i\u2019ve been reading john le carr\u00e9, and all my years in germany", "i love that kind of thing", "i love those thriller stories", "i loved true blood", "i loved the vampires", "there\u2019s so much tv that i like right now", "i\u2019m watching the affair", "ah, the affair", "all right, so just as a quick side note for the affair", "a lot of it or a portion of it takes place in a restaurant called \u201cthe lobster roll\u201d out on long island in montauk", "is that a real place", "it\u2019s a real place",

with, fellow townies on long island, who have said it\u2019s very surreal to watch", "i remember getting yelled at by rich city people and having to clean up their messes", "that\u2019s so funny", "that\u2019s so funny that it\u2019s a real place", "oh, yeah", "very much a real place", "if you had one gigantic billboard you could put a short message on it to get it out to millions of people, what would you put on that", "i think i\u2019m really bad at these questions", "i can zig instead of zag here and we can do different types of questions", "but if anything comes to mind, let me know", "otherwise we can table it and come back", "okay, maybe that line that you started with right now", "that anger is what fear and pain look like when they show themselves in public", "i think that would be a good thing for people to reflect on, even briefly", "yeah, absolutely", "you talked a little bit about your morning", "you mentioned the meditation while your tea was steeping, if i remember correctly", "what does the first 60 minutes of a good day for you \u2013 what does that look like", "yeah, a good day is like i\u2019ve had a pretty good sleep", "i love my sleep", "i get up and i do, i start to make my tea", "what time do you wake up and what kind of tea", "i wake up about 6:30", "what\u2019s your go-to tea", "it\u2019s yorkshire gold", "yorkshire gold", "is that a black tea", "yeah, which is what makes good, strong, black tea in minnesota", "i think everywhere you are with the water it\u2019s different", "yeah, i sit for about ten minutes and sometimes i read a little bit", "i read a little thomas orton, or a little pema ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n, or a little rilke, and then i actually have started adding prayer back into my meditation", "i realized that\u2019s my mother tongue and that\u2019s kind of been a revelation for me to start doing that again", "i\u2019m not particularly religious", "i was just speaking to a very close friend of mine recently who is",

services", "it\u2019s very poetic", "recently \u2013 i\u2019ve never talked to anybody about this \u2013 this summer, i got quiet and rested for the first time in about ten years", "it was amazing", "i was on big sur", "it was incredible", "one thing i did was i actually wrote a prayer", "it was like the prayer of my life right now", "it was such an incredible thing to do", "i never thought of doing that", "i think the thing is, and i\u2019ve been saying, i think spiritual life is very \u2013 we all have personality types, so you have to find what works for you", "i grew up southern baptist, which is all very free-flowing", "when the minister was praying, you were supposed to be praying your own prayer in your head", "there\u2019s something about me that likes \u2013 i like liturgy, i like ritual", "but i think previously i would have thought that even writing my own prayer would be not as good as a prayer that had been around for hundreds or thousands of years", "but somehow i managed something that is a really good way for me to move into the day", "i say that and i also have some time of silence and just breathing and sometimes kind of a mantra", "all of this in ten minutes", "isn\u2019t that incredible", "i\u2019m so productive", "of course, just like everybody else, i will be distracted for six of those ten minutes", "i think that\u2019s why having a bit of liturgy that you have to stick to, like having something to hang on with", "then i make my tea and put my milk in it and i get to email", "if i have writing to do, i do that in the mornings", "just when my mind is clear", "i\u2019m happy if i\u2019ve prepared the day with important correspondence or with getting some important ideas out", "then eventually i go to work about 9:30 or 10:00",

your prayer", "or is that something you\u2019d prefer not to discuss", "you mean now", "at this time", "yeah", "i can tell you what it\u2019s \u2013 maybe i can tell you \u2013 gosh, can i even, it\u2019s just funny because i\u2019ve learned it by heart", "yeah, or what it\u2019s about", "however \u2013 i know people would love more details because it\u2019s so valuable to you", "in a way, it reflects that i\u2019ve been learning about myself, like what i need to work on my inner life, my spiritual work", "the thing that i\u2019ve been \u2013 i pray to keep learning to open my heart and keep learning to let go of the kind of resistance and protectiveness that saved me when i was growing up and it doesn\u2019t fit \u2013 it became an armor around my natural love and trust and softness", "that\u2019s kind of my life work, right", "i\u2019m so much better", "i mean, just the fact that i can say it that way means i\u2019m getting somewhere", "but it\u2019s still my life work", "i pray that \u2013 it\u2019s like when i incline to ambition, to know to take the light", "that what i fear that i might welcome and i pray about blessing the \u2013 constantly knowing the difference between intentions and consequences", "because i think there\u2019s something mysterious about what becomes of our actions that we don\u2019t control and that\u2019s actually largely a wonderful thing", "but it doesn\u2019t necessarily converge with my american can-do accomplishment mentality", "so lean into that", "that you do the right thing for the right reason and to some extent you have to let go of what becomes of it", "that\u2019s kind of some of the big ideas", "of course, again, i say it every morning and now i \u2013 i spent some time last december in austria with brother david steindl-rast", "i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard that interview", "he\u2019s a benedictine monk", "he\u2019s austrian", "he\u2019s one of the great people in the world thinking about gratitude", "that\u2019s probably one of those words i avoid a little bit too because it\u2019s just been on too many hallmark cards", "what i like about him is he lived through the fascist occupation of his country as a teenager", "he knows how gritty the world is", "one of the things he says is that it would be absurd for any of us to say that you should be grateful for everything that happens to you", "we don\u2019t say that", "but that you can be grateful in every moment", "that\u2019s really stuck with me, so that\u2019s how my prayer ends", "teach me to be grateful in every moment", "that\u2019s a practice that helps me", "that\u2019s extremely powerful and thank you for sharing", "i\u2019m glad you did", "i think that\u2019s going to be \u2013 i think that many pieces of that will be extremely helpful for many people", "thank you", "well, i certainly did not expect to talk about that", "i didn\u2019t expect to ask you about it", "it makes me also want to go find wild geese that you mentioned earlier on top of that", "well, just one or two more questions and then i\u2019ll let you get back to your day", "this is basically the tail end", "i\u2019d like to ask if you have any \u2013 and i\u2019ll ask where people can find you and so on \u2013 but first, do you have any requests of my audience", "the people listening", "anything that you\u2019d like them to take away", "anything you\u2019d like them to try", "anything you\u2019d like them to consider or otherwise", "any parting words for the people listening", "as i said a minute ago, i\u2019m just intensely aware of how many messages we internalize", "i feel that gets in the way of people really knowing how much power they have in terms of how they move through the world, the world around them, the people they can see and touch", "the small and large interactions we have", "we live in this bizarre moment where the place we have wanted to look for modeling and leadership and the way forward are very dysfunctional and partly because of our technology", "we\u2019re turn-of-century people", "we\u2019re in this moment where all of us who are adults were born in one world of assumptions and institutions that made sense and we are growing up or growing old in a world in which most of our disciplines, the way things have been done, don\u2019t make sense", "we have to create the changed realities and it\u2019s not going to happen from the top", "that\u2019s not the way our digital world works anyway", "but i think we have more power, more agency to do that than we are made to feel", "it\u2019s a wonderful calling", "i think we have to keep each other, accompany each other in keeping that sense", "that would be my encouragement", "somebody was talking to me yesterday about a phrase, \u201csocial courage.\u201d i think that\u2019s a good way to talk", "that\u2019s something i want to invite people and call people\u2019s attention to, just to make clear that is available to us", "i can\u2019t think of any time when that has been more important, certainly in my lifetime, that i am consciously aware of than right now", "being socially courageous, which i think also means probably presenting and potentially defending important views or perspectives or experiences that are very unpopular", "i think in terms of the different callings of this moment", "some of us are going to have to defend and some of us may have to put our bodies in the way of danger that is coming to some people who are on the front lines of vulnerability", "i also think there\u2019s a calling for many of us to be calmers of fear", "yes", "i think there\u2019s some very quiet callings right now that can also make a huge difference", "krista, this has been so much fun", "i really appreciate you taking the time", "i\u2019d like to encourage people to check our your work", "where can people say hello", "where can people find out more about you and if you have any recommended starting points, and i\u2019m not going to ask you a favorite interview question because i don\u2019t like getting that any more than you do", "but where can people find you and what would you suggest they start with, if you have a recommendation", "the website is onbeing.org", "we also have something called the civil conversations project that we\u2019re going to be building out", "there\u2019s also a civilcoversationsproject.org website", "it actually has a little guide i wrote that we\u2019re calling \u201cbetter conversations.\u201d we have the on being app in the app store and, of course, you can find the on being podcast in itunes or wherever you get podcasts", "i am not on facebook", "for some reason, it just makes me break out in hives", "but i do actually love twitter", "i mostly go there to correspond and communicate with people who reach out to me there", "that\u2019s a good place to check in", "@kristatippett", "yeah, just @kristatippett", "two ps, two ts", "you have to do that as much as i do \u2013 double-r, double-s", "but tim, i want to thank you so much", "also, i was really tired today", "here we are \u2013 isn\u2019t it friday the 13th today", "it is friday the 13th", "anyway, it\u2019s friday afternoon and i\u2019m so tired today and it\u2019s just been really energizing", "you have built something amazing and i\u2019m so amazed that you\u2019re listening to on being and i\u2019m really grateful to meet your audience that are people like this", "well, it\u2019s really fun and meaningful for me to have you on", "i hope this is not the last conversation that we have", "yeah, well, we\u2019ll get together at some time and talk about berlin", "yes", "i would love to do that and you can listen to my mangled german", "but that\u2019s okay", "ein fu\u00df nach dem anderen, right", "it\u2019s one little step after the other", "as i butcher yet another language", "that\u2019s good", "thank you so much", "to everybody listening, as always, you can find show notes, links to everything that we discussed, at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, all spelled out, as well as every other episode", "until next time, thank you for listening"]}
