This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show. Please excuse my irreverence. I\u2019ve had way too much coffee and that is my dog attempting to do breakdancing \u2013 sorry for the background noise. This episode, like all episodes of the Tim Ferriss Show, includes a dose of deconstructing someone who is a world-class performer and exceptionally good at what they do. In this case, we have a science writer but the other half of this show, quite frankly, is purely selfish. It is me exploring subjects that I want to know more about and, in this case, the guest is not a military strategist, not an entertainer \u2013 it is Erik Vance. Erik with a \u201ck\u201d \u2013 you can say hi to him on Twitter @erikvance. He is an award-winning science writer based in California and Mexico City. After working as a scientist on research projects dealing with dolphin intelligence and coastal ecology, he became an educator and then, later, an environmental consultant. In 2005, he switched gears and attended UC Santa Cruz\u2019s famed Science Communication Program \u2013 great program, I almost went to UC Santa Cruz for Fiction, in fact \u2013 and discovered a passion for journalism. Since then, he has built his career around science-based profiles of inspiring or controversial figures. And we dig into not only the science but also his approach to writing and conveying that. His work has appeared in Harper\u2019s Magazine, The New York Times, Scientific American, and National Geographic. He\u2019s also been a contributing editor at Discover magazine. And his latest book is Suggestible You: The Curious Science of Your Brain\u2019s Ability to Deceive, Transform, and Heal. In this episode, we cover many topics with equal amounts of the profound, actionable, and hilarious. We talk about the power of placebo \u2013 and how you can increase the odds of it working for you if you so choose \u2013 which conditions respond well to placebo \u2013 for instance, depression, Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 and which do not, how the mind, religion, bedside manner, and peer pressure can dramatically influence medical outcomes. And then we get to some stories \u2013 and not necessarily in that order \u2013 catching porcupines in South Africa. The story alone is worth the time it takes to listen to this episode. It will make you laugh out loud \u2013 it\u2019s awesome. Also, finding and studying a pig shit sommelier \u2013 yes, you heard me correctly \u2013 why he got electrocuted for a half an hour at the NIH Laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland, the story of why he chose to be cursed by a witch doctor in New York City, and much, much more. So please enjoy a conversation that I very much enjoyed with Erik Vance. And, as always, you can find all links to everything mentioned in this episode in the show notes for this episode and every other episode at fourhourworkweek.com \u2013 all spelled out \u2013 fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. Erik, welcome to the show. Erik Vance: Thanks for having me, Tim. I appreciate it. Tim Ferriss: Of course. And where does this find you at the moment? Erik Vance: I am currently in my office in Mexico City in the Norte Roma \u2013 if anyone\u2019s ever been to Mexico City \u2013 where I\u2019m based. Tim Ferriss: In the [speaking Spanish]. Erik Vance: [Speaking Spanish] exactly. Tim Ferriss: How did you end up in Mexico City? Erik Vance: Actually, I told my wife years ago that \u2013 I\u2019m a freelance journalist \u2013 that I can live anywhere in the world and I wanted to travel with her. And she works in development and she came back and told me Mexico City is where she\u2019d gotten a job. And I said, \u201cI kind of meant Paris or Venice \u2013 anywhere in the world \u2013 London?\u201d But we came down here and I fell in love with it and so I love it. It\u2019s an amazing city. Tim Ferriss: Great food, from what I hear \u2013 I\u2019ve never been but incredible food. [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: Definitely. Tim Ferriss: And you\u2019ve traveled a lot \u2013 you\u2019ve spent time all over the planet and what I\u2019d like to start with, perhaps is why biology? How did you get interested in biology? And we\u2019ll talk about some of the adventures that then relate to that but how the initial interest? Erik Vance: When I was a kid, I was never all that good in school. I had some attention issues and I \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Some tension issues? Erik Vance: Attention, sorry. Tim Ferriss: Oh, attention. Sorry. Got it. Erik Vance: I didn\u2019t pay attention real well but, when I was out of school, I spent a lot of time walking through the woods basically looking for dead things and then sort of poking them, and opening them up, and stuff. And I didn\u2019t realize this was a field \u2013 it\u2019s wasn\u2019t until later\u2026 Even when I went through Biology classes, I didn\u2019t really realize that that\u2019s what we were talking about until I really got to just before college when I realized that poking dead things and finding them is actually something people do for a living and I was hooked at that point. Tim Ferriss: And what did the trajectory look like? Did you go immediately, as soon as you got into undergrad, into the sciences? Erik Vance: I did. I got really hooked as an undergrad in those Field Biology. There\u2019s two kinds of Biology \u2013 there\u2019s \u201cMicroscope Biology\u201d and \u201cBinoculars Biology\u201d and I got into \u201cBinoculars Biology\u201d \u2013 chasing after animals and stuff like that, and looking at trees. I loved it and I really wanted to be a scientist. I wanted to be a Ph.D. and publish papers. I just wasn\u2019t that good at it. I loved wondering and learning new things but doing the actual work was not my forte and so I went through a bit of a crisis and backed away from Biology and discovered Journalism and, specifically, Science Journalism and that\u2019s where I really found my groove. Tim Ferriss: How old were you when that happened \u2013 when you took that fork in the road? Erik Vance: I was 27, I think. I\u2019d spent a solid five years after college being a biologist for hire and working in some laboratories around the world and doing some different things but never really logging it. I kept jumping from one thing to the next. I was about 27 when I finally discovered science writing and went back to grad school for Journalism. Tim Ferriss: How did you make that decision in the sense that \u2013 and I also realize that I accidentally used a Yogi Bear quote, \u201cWhen you took that fork in the road\u2026\u201d \u201cIf you reach a fork in the road, take it,\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s not proper English, folks. I need more caffeine. What was the moment in which you decided that you were going to bite the bullet, so to speak, and pursue that? Was it a particular conversation or a particular dinner? Erik Vance: I always had this scientific sense of superiority to writers and I always thought writers were kind of a bore. And, yet, I have written a novel that will never be published \u2013 and never should be published \u2013 as a scientist and I just love writing but I just didn\u2019t like\u2026 There\u2019s something about that process that I just couldn\u2019t admit that I actually liked. It was like this, \u201cI know I\u2019m a scientist. I\u2019m analytical,\u201d and yet I\u2019m doing all this stuff on the side. And, finally, it was really a matter of a single Google search after doing some soul searching where I typed \u201cscience and writing\u201d into a Google search and, lo and behold, I found out there\u2019s a whole career for science writers I had never really thought of. And, when I was a kid, I used to get these little things called \u201cZoobooks.\u201d They were these little magazines \u2013 it was like your first mail you ever got when you were a kid \u2013 and I always loved that you have the animals and you learn about the animals and I always wanted to be the guy who was in the magazine who was pulling apart sharks or picking up ants and stuff. And what I realized in that moment was that I don\u2019t want to be the guy in the magazine \u2013 I want to be the guy making the magazine. It was the magazine that I really loved \u2013 it wasn\u2019t\u2026 Every month, it was something new and that\u2019s what I liked. And that clicked and then I was off. Tim Ferriss: Now, although you went on the other side of the camera, so to speak, to document, and interview, and research, you\u2019ve also spent a fair amount of time in the field. Right? Erik Vance: Yup. Tim Ferriss: And I don\u2019t know the answer to this question but which came first \u2013 the pig shit or the porcupines? Erik Vance: Oh, the porcupines came before the pig shit. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So can you explain the porcupines, please? Erik Vance: Well, alright. So, in my process of trying to be a scientist, one of the places I went was in South Africa. And, basically, I needed a subject for my Ph.D. so I just figured I\u2019d go to South Africa, and catch sharks, and do cool stuff, and figure out what I was all about. Tim Ferriss: Why South Africa? Erik Vance: I had seen the movie The Power of One\u00a0and I really liked it \u2013 I thought it was good \u2013 and so I said, \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m going. Yes.\u201d And that was literally as much thought as I put into it. I was an idiot as a kid. And I actually tried to reenact\u2026 I\u2019d go through these slums of South Africa \u2013 I\u2019d go jogging and stuff \u2013 thinking that children would chase me and I just had people be like, \u201cDude, you shouldn\u2019t be here. Go away before you get hurt.\u201d So I\u2019m wondering around and I ended up hooking up with this laboratory in Cape Town \u2013 University of Cape Town \u2013 and, sometimes, they farmed out their scientists to documentaries and I was still a scientist at that point. But there was a documentary \u2013 the BBC was doing a program on aardvarks and the animals that live in their burrows so it was really exciting stuff. Tim Ferriss: Sounds like a thriller. Erik Vance: Oh, yeah, really. They had aardwolves and a bunch of other animals that live in these burrows and one of them was porcupines. So what they needed was a biologist to go and catch the porcupines and habituate them and that was the deal. And they\u2019ve got this lame kid wandering around their lab who they were just like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s just send him because he\u2019s not really doing anything.\u201d And so they sent me into the bush for 10 days with some really interesting characters. The people who end up signing up for this are a diverse group. And the guy who was leading the expedition was this guy who spent a lot of time in the bush and was really savvy but really quiet \u2013 didn\u2019t say anything \u2013 and he\u2019d occasionally catch birds with his bare hands and that was about all. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like a praying mantis, although a very large one, yeah. Erik Vance: He\u2019d walk in front of the car and there\u2019d be this bird crouched and he\u2019d just snap out and grab it. And then there was this other dude who was in the field to detox from his heroin addiction. And he was a former Satan worshiper who had become a born again Christian. And I learned that there\u2019s not actually that different, actually \u2013 he didn\u2019t actually change much, he just switched sides. Just before, he\u2019d say, \u201cI can feel the claws of Satan ripping into my chest and parting the skin of my chest and, now, it\u2019s a bad thing. Before, it was a good thing.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Before, it was like a massage. Erik Vance: That was Saturday night. It was a normal thing. And he was really intense and he was still totally focused on Satan as a born again Christian \u2013 which I never really thought about before but it is a big thing \u2013 and he was just this really interesting guy. And it was me, and him, and this guy who never spoke and so we spent our days smoking cigarettes and the recovering addict would try to catch fish with a stick and a hook that he had found. And then, at night, we\u2019d go out with this giant truck and this light \u2013 these rifle-looking flashlights \u2013 and look for porcupines and I learned a few things about porcupines. We were not prepared \u2013 it was Day 3 before someone suggested we get some gloves. We had blankets \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Somebody forgot the packing list. Erik Vance: Well, it didn\u2019t even occur to us. That\u2019s how bad it was. It wasn\u2019t that we forgot them \u2013 it just never occurred that we might want them to catch the porcupines. Tim Ferriss: Thank god they called the professionals. Erik Vance: Right? This is who they sent. And so a quick thing about porcupines \u2013 actually, we learned that there were two primary defense strategies that porcupines have, not surprising to anyone. One of them \u2013 the surprising one, I suppose \u2013 was that they\u2019re actually really fast, especially when you\u2019ve been smoking cigarettes all day. Actually, when they started to run, you\u2019re just like, \u201cOh, shit. This one\u2019s running,\u201d and they know where their burrow is \u2013 you don\u2019t \u2013 and so we spent a lot of time just tripping over rocks and stuff and then with our hands on our knees just catching our breath and having been dusted by some fat little porcupine. So that was the first technique. The second one was more usable which was they stick their head against a tree, put up their quills and go, \u201cGive it your best shot, asshole. Go ahead.\u201d And those were the ones we wanted because we had a little syringe of ketamine \u2013 which was endlessly fascinating to the recovering addict \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sure \u2013 endlessly fascinating to a lot of people in Silicon Valley, too. [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: Yeah. It\u2019s actually very useful for tranquilizing these animals but what\u2019s interesting \u2013 what I didn\u2019t realize \u2013 is that when you watch a nature film about animals like a porcupine, they didn\u2019t just stumble upon that animal and now they\u2019re filming it. That\u2019s not the way it works. Someone went out beforehand and prepped the whole scene. And one of the ways they had to prep it is you have to catch the animal, you drug it, and then you have to put a tracking device inside of it because people watching TV don\u2019t want to see a radio collar. Tim Ferriss: They don\u2019t want to see a Petco Harvey collar around the wild porcupine? Right? Erik Vance: Yeah, it kind of kills the mood. It\u2019s not great for the porcupine because he has to go through this surgery but\u2026 So we did that with this one porcupine that they named \u201cUncle Erik.\u201d And I never really was clear whether they were making fun of me or it was in honor of me \u2013 it really could have gone either way. So we did that and then we released Uncle Erik back into the wild to lick his wounds. And then the next step is to habituate and so, basically, habituation is one step down from taming. You basically hang out with the porcupine \u2013 or whatever animal \u2013 for hours, and hours, and hours until they realize that you\u2019re not going to hurt them and they understand that you\u2019re not going to feed them so they just ignore you \u2013 like you\u2019re just another tree or whatever in their environment and they just go about their business \u2013 and that\u2019s when you bring in the film crew. So it\u2019s not at all like a natural setting, but you might wonder how do you do that? And, basically, you just have to talk to him for hours and hours on end. You have to get him used to the human voice because, when people come in to film him, they\u2019ll be talking. So I sat out there in the middle of the classic empty savannah with the huge sky and scorpions crawling over my feet and just talked to this porcupine. And what do you talk about \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Uncle Erik? Erik Vance: Uncle Erik and me hanging out together. And it was me and this porcupine and what do you talk about? Well, you talk to him about your relationship problems. I was sitting there being like, \u201cAnd then she told me she didn\u2019t want me to come because her friend was coming but I didn\u2019t know her friend. Okay, let me go back a couple years,\u201d and the porcupine\u2019s sitting there listening to me bitch endlessly about this woman \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: And what is the porcupine doing? Not sitting on a rock, smoking a cigarette, listening, I\u2019m guessing? Erik Vance: No, he\u2019s sitting with his head against the tree \u2013 as you found him in the first place \u2013 with his spines up, going, \u201cPlease god, make it stop.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Like, \u201cDude, attack me or leave. I can\u2019t do this forever.\u201d Erik Vance: Yeah. \u201cAre you going to kill me or what? What is this?\u201d And I remember, one night, I heard the storm coming so I started to go up on a little ridge and look out and I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got an hour or so before it comes.\u201d I come back and then Uncle Erik\u2019s gone. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. Dangit.\u201d So I grab my tracking device and flip it on and he\u2019s not popping up on the scanner at all and this thing has 100-yard radius so he basically cleared 100 yards in less than a minute just to get away from me. As soon as I turned my back on him, he was like, \u201cI\u2019m gone,\u201d and he just bolted for the horizon. And I remember that was one of the moments where I really was wondering if I was in the right career or not. Tim Ferriss: So that was on the field biology side? I like the \u201cBinoculars\u201d versus \u201cMicroscopes.\u201d Actually, the last interviewee or the last few folks I had on interview were on the opposite end of the spectrum so they were actually focused on things like the mechanistic target of rapamycin and looking at M-12 and all this cool stuff. So the field biology, if we then flash forward, you are learning more about science writing. What was the program that you were in? Erik Vance: It was actually the University of California Santa Cruz Science Writing Program which really changed my life. It\u2019s an amazing program. Tim Ferriss: Who or what lessons had the biggest impact on you through that course \u2013 or program, I should say? Erik Vance: God, there\u2019s so many. The biggest thing is, as a scientist, you\u2019re trying to be exact. You need to be precise. And, as a storyteller, you need to convey a feeling, a sense, because people don\u2019t read journalism or storytelling the same way that they read a scientific paper. You walk away with an idea \u2013 a couple little facts and an idea. And you really have to shift your thinking to tell a story to someone \u2013 you have to have characters, you have to have an arc \u2013 and that\u2019s really hard. That\u2019s something, I think, I learned there but I constantly am trying to perfect because it\u2019s a totally different way. Aside from the little things like no longer using the passive tense and the technical jargon and all that stuff, it\u2019s really about telling a story and it\u2019s not about conveying information. Tim Ferriss: Or it\u2019s about wrapping the information in this sugar-coated delight called a story so that you actually absorb it. Erik Vance: Right. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Who are some\u2026? Well, I guess I have so many questions just because I just finished a book, myself, so writing is on the brain. What about your writing \u2013 besides, say, using the passive tense less \u2013 improved the most before and after \u2013 going into the program \u2013 coming out of the program? And the reason I ask is I can think of, for instance, in my own history going back to a class that I took with John McFee which was called \u201cThe Literature of Fact\u201d and what he really burned into my brain \u2013 and of course, I won\u2019t even approach 10 percent of the writer he is, ever \u2013 but was how visually he thinks of structure and would almost spec it out on a blackboard or whiteboard like a football player \u2013 it was really fascinating \u2013 or even like a Krebs cycle. It was very, very visual and I\u2019d never thought of architecting something out that way so that was a novel idea that I still rely on, sometimes, when I am stuck. When I can\u2019t figure out how to structure a story, that\u2019s something that I\u2019ll still do. Are there any tools or any particular changes that you experienced in your own writing? Erik Vance:\u00a0Yeah, that\u2019s a really good one. Have you ever heard of \u201cThe Open Notebook?\u201d Tim Ferriss: No, I haven\u2019t. Erik Vance: You should check it out. It\u2019s a website run by some really good science writers that\u2019s for science writers. And they have a section that\u2019s just that \u2013 it\u2019s just basically science writers doing schematics of stories they done \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, how cool. [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: \u2013 and their favorite stories. Tim Ferriss: Oh, that\u2019s awesome. Erik Vance: It\u2019s great. I did one where I actually tried to sketch out Burkhard Bilger\u2019s \u2013 a New Yorker story he did on youth rodeo programs. It\u2019s an amazing story and I just loved it and so I tried to sketch it out and I just sketched out one of my own. And I loved it \u2013 it\u2019s very visual, it\u2019s very cool. Tim Ferriss: Oh, so it\u2019s people taking a stab at other authors\u2019 or other writers\u2019 work in addition to their own? Erik Vance: In addition to their own, yeah. Exactly. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, that\u2019s cool. Erik Vance: So your experience as a reader and your experience as a writer. And, of course, I liked his story better than the one I did so it looks a lot better. You\u2019d like it \u2013 there\u2019s lots of other gems in there, too. But the thing that I think I really took away \u2013 and I wasn\u2019t expecting from that program \u2013 was a love of characters, of the people\u2026 I tell the story about the porcupines and it\u2019s just a weird thing but you tell a biologist this story and they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, whatever. Of course, that\u2019s our job.\u201d They\u2019re weird people doing a weird job and that\u2019s what I really fell in love with was the people who do it and how they approach it and so I love\u2026 For the first couple years of my career, I just wrote profiles about amazing scientists who I thought were doing cool stuff and that\u2019s really what I focused on was, \u201cWho are these people who are interesting but also can tell a broader story?\u201d I have something I want to say about gene therapy or chemicals in the atmosphere that geo- asphalt organic compounds that changed the atmosphere of the forest \u2013 I want to tell that story but I really want to tell it through a person. Who is that person who can tell that story? And what\u2019s their life like? And what do they think about? And why are they sitting on top of a tree trying to get these air samples? How did they end up there? And that\u2019s what I really fell in love with \u2013 that program \u2013 is the people. How do you tell a story through a person? Who is that person? And it\u2019s not always the easiest person to find \u2013 sometimes, they\u2019re the ones you\u2019re not looking for. Tim Ferriss: So that\u2019s the best tee-up I could imagine for my next question which is\u2026 I should point out these are all new things to me \u2013 I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. The first reporting assignment \u2013 you sent me a little note \u2013 is with a guy who studies the smell of pig shit for a living so probably not the Mickey Mantle you were looking for for ten years. How did that come to be? And walk me through\u2026 you graduate from your program, how do you go from there to this assignment? Erik Vance: Well, you\u2019re a young, freelance writer \u2013 no one cares what you want to write about. Of course, I want to write about sharks, and important stuff, and \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: And they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, get in line, buddy.\u201d Erik Vance: Yeah. Like, \u201cGo ahead. We\u2019ll look at your pitch. Yeah, definitely.\u201d And so you have to come up with stuff they don\u2019t have and one of those things is chemistry \u2013 not a lot of people covering chemistry. So I was like, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do some chemistry.\u201d And it actually started, I was working at the Chronicle of Higher Education and I got this little \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Where was that? Erik Vance: The Chronicle of Higher Education in Washington, D.C. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I got it. Erik Vance: It\u2019s a magazine that, unless you\u2019re\u2026 It\u2019s highly respected among universities and no one else has heard of it. But it\u2019s actually really great outlet \u2013 they do great science writing \u2013 so it was my opportunity to really dig in and do cool stories. But one of those stories that I did that wasn\u2019t that cool was this side 300-word blurb about the chemical in\u2026 have you ever heard of ladybug taint? Tim Ferriss: That pulls up an incredible image in my head \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not accurate \u2013 so I\u2019m going to say no. Erik Vance: I had the greatest title for this story that they wouldn\u2019t let me use but\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Wait, wait \u2013 okay, so now I have to ask what was the headline? Erik Vance: \u201cStinky Ladybug Taint.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That could be your punk rock band at this point. Erik Vance: Right? Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, no, I don\u2019t know what ladybug taint is. What is it? Erik Vance: So, if you\u2019re crushing a bunch of\u2026 You\u2019re from the Bay Area, right? Tim Ferriss: I am. Well, I live in the Bay Area, yeah. Erik Vance: You live in the Bay Area. Well, if you\u2019re crushing up a bunch of grapes in a classic sort of wine crush, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to get one or two ladybugs in there \u2013 it just happens. And what happens is, if you get one ladybug in a big vat, you get this nice little bell pepper taste. It\u2019s this nice hint in the background. If you get two or three, it gets overpowering and it just ruins the whole batch. And it\u2019s called ladybug taint \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: That must be hard as hell to deal with. Ladybugs\u2026 I don\u2019t know how many people listening have been inside a wine vat but those things are gigantic. Wow. Okay. Erik Vance: And you can\u2019t drop a ladybug in because you don\u2019t know if there\u2019s already one in there so, apparently, it\u2019s a big thing. Anyway, what\u2019s interesting is I was talking to a scientist who discovered the chemical that does this. It\u2019s an extremely potent, powerful chemical. I think I calculated that, if you took an Olympic-sized swimming pool and you put a teaspoon in there, you\u2019d still be able to taste it. This stuff is brutal. Tim Ferriss: So sharks are to blood what humans are the ladybug taint in a swimming pool. Something like that. Erik Vance: If a shark smelled this, he\u2019d be the same way. He\u2019d be like, \u201cDamn, No, no, no.\u201d Anyone\u2026 It\u2019s potent. And so I started talking to this guy the way I do and I was like, \u201cWow, this is a weird job. How did you find this?\u201d and he was like, \u201cOh, there were some ladybugs in my windowsill and I shook them up in a jar and smelled this thing\u2026\u201d If you ever eat a ladybug \u2013 which I don\u2019t know, Tim, have you eaten any ladybugs? Tim Ferriss: No, I\u2019ve eaten a lot of crickets but no ladybugs. I need to expand my repertoire, maybe. Erik Vance: There\u2019s a reason why you don\u2019t \u2013 and that\u2019s the reason why they\u2019re red and black, it\u2019s a warning sign \u2013 because they have this chemical and they will unleash it if you try to eat them. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s for. So he smelled this thing and he was like, \u201cOh my god, I\u2019ve got to figure out what this is.\u201d So I asked him, of course, \u201cWell, what\u2019s your job that you do this?\u201d and he was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t actually study ladybugs. I actually study pig shit.\u201d He didn\u2019t say it like that but that\u2019s what went through my head and I was like, \u201cWait\u2026 like\u2026?\u201d And he specifically focuses on smells and these strong smells and the chemicals that are involved in what we smell. And so I was like, \u201cOh my god, wait, so you study the smell of pig manure?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, the aerosol chemical nature of\u2026\u201d He had a great way to say, \u201cI study smelly pig shit.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh my god. I have to come out and meet you. I have to see your laboratory. This is amazing.\u201d And so I pitched Nature\u00a0\u2013 which is a very prestigious journal that also does a lot of science journalism and I\u2019ve done a little work for them before and I\u2019m like, \u201cPlease send me out to talk to this guy.\u201d He was in Iowa and they were like, \u201cAlright, you\u2019ve got a couple hundred dollars. Go out there, come back, get the story.\u201d It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been on assignment to do a story like that. I was very excited. And it was the most amazing lab I\u2019ve ever seen. Tim Ferriss: Now, hold on. What did this\u2026? So this was your first pitch for a remote assignment? Erik Vance: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Okay. What did the\u2026? Did you do it via letter, or email, or was it via sound \u2013 when you were like, \u201cHey boss,\u201d or, \u201cHey editor\u2026\u201d Erik Vance: I put together a nice email with all the pieces the pitch has to have and it was fascinating jobs. And I caged around people who have interesting jobs and tried to keep the poop humor to a minimum although I did get the word poop in the journal Nature and that I want \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a win. [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: That\u2019s a win. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so you fly out to Iowa\u2026? Erik Vance: So I fly out to Iowa. Well, actually, I flew out to Nebraska because I didn\u2019t actually know the difference between the two so ended up renting a car and driving to Iowa because that\u2019s how nervous I was when I was booking my tickets. So I get out of the car and you can smell it as soon as you get out \u2013 so you can actually smell it. It\u2019s phenol \u2013 the specific \u2013 it\u2019s often called by people who are into this world, it\u2019s called \u201cband aid\u201d or \u201cfarmyard.\u201d And it\u2019s the first thing you smell when you know there\u2019s a barnyard nearby \u2013 it has a very low vapor pressure so it sticks to anything it touches which means a little bit of dust in the air and it\u2019ll stick to it and it\u2019s the first thing you\u2019ll smell. It smells a little bit like a band aid and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, there must be a farm nearby,\u201d \u2013 that one. So that\u2019s what I smell as soon as I get out. It\u2019s a very agricultural area \u2013 it\u2019s up in Ames. And I go in this guy\u2019s lab and he just introduces me to this world of smells. Everybody\u2019s got these smelly pens everywhere and he has all the students smelling the pens with their eyes closed to try to really hone their ability to recognize smells that are hidden. And he\u2019s got this device called the \u2013 let\u2019s see if I can do this \u2013 \u201cmultidimensional gas chromatography mass speckle hectometer.\u201d You\u2019ve got one, right? Tim Ferriss: Oh my god. Yeah, I\u2019m looking at one right now next to my tea. Okay. Erik Vance: He\u2019s just amazing. So you put \u2013 let\u2019s go back to wine \u2013 you pour some wine in this thing and then what it does is gas chromatography. It cuts the wine up into different pieces, into different chemical components. And it breaks them up, pushes them aside from each other and it starts giving to you one at a time. It\u2019s a little cup that goes over your nose at the same time you have a mass spectomy \u2013 a layout of what these things are. So you\u2019re smelling it, the computer\u2019s analyzing it, and, together, you can find stuff that no one\u2019s found before because our noses are incredibly sensitive. And so he does this with wine \u2013 and that\u2019s for practice and for some other things \u2013 but, mostly, he focuses on pig shit. That\u2019s his bread and butter. And he studies these chemicals that make pig shit really, really bad. And he\u2019s looking for subtle differences of that one big dropping that\u2019s going to solve it \u2013 and he\u2019s trying to diminish that smell. Tim Ferriss: I was going to ask\u2026 I assume he\u2019s not making perfume. Now, why is it important to diminish the smell of pig shit? Erik Vance: Well, to your point, this guy has the kind of nose that he could be making perfumes \u2013 he\u2019s incredibly sensitive \u2013 but he\u2019s doing this because the idea is, if you can change the food that a pig eats in order to change what comes out from the other end, then you can diminish the smell of a pig farm and that\u2019s actually the biggest obstacle in building new pig farms. Tim Ferriss: Ah, for zoning, and neighbors, and so on or anything like that? Erik Vance: Yeah. Exactly. Not just for\u2026 For whole communities that don\u2019t want these things nearby and, if you can diminish that, maybe you can put more of the closer, you can put more pigs in them \u2013 there\u2019s just all kinds of opportunities that can come up once you can give the pig what it needs without having to get the worst chemicals. And some of these chemicals \u2013 like with the ladybug \u2013 are really, really subtle \u2013 they\u2019re really small. So that\u2019s what he does and he\u2019s got this device and he hooked me up to it. And he was worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get all of the nuance. So, rather than leaving the sample and leaving it in for a couple minutes \u2013 ten minutes \u2013 which is what he would do, he left it in overnight so it really was pungent. When he stuck this thing on my nose, I was\u2026 The first couple things you smell are actually the interesting things \u2013 because it\u2019s broken up into pieces \u2013 and there\u2019s some nice things in pig shit. There\u2019s wet cardboard, and taco shell, and mushroom \u2013 all these great smells\u2026. All these things you think are really obnoxious, like wine drinkers, those are real chemicals and you can smell those separately. I was like, \u201cThis is great,\u201d \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m just imagining saying to a date like, \u201cYou smell wonderful. It\u2019s like wet cardboard and mushrooms.\u201d Erik Vance: Yeah. \u201cWow.\u201d And you don\u2019t know it until you smell it. You\u2019re like, \u201cOh my god, that totally is wet cardboard.\u201d And the pigs haven\u2019t been eating cardboard \u2013 it\u2019s just the same chemical. And then we get to the sulfates and, man, that\u2019s the business end of pig shit. I felt like I was getting run over by a manure truck and had my face down one of those Port-a-Potties for\u2026 It was just horrible. And, as I mentioned, these things have a low vapor pressure so they stick to whatever they touch \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that\u2019s horrible. Erik Vance: \u2013 the inside of your nose. Meaning, for the next three days, everything I ate, everything I smelled\u2026 I was just like, \u201cOh god.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Had a hint of pig sphincter taint? Erik Vance: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So you turn in that piece \u2013 was there any turn of phrase or portion of that piece that you were proudest of when you turned it in? Erik Vance: Yeah. That\u2019s the great thing about this job is, if you read my stories \u2013 or any story, any science writer, or any journalist \u2013 you only get a fraction of the experience that they had when they were reporting that story. And it\u2019s so rich \u2013 I wish there were more ways to share these things \u2013 but the part that I really enjoyed the most was this gentleman had a \u2013 like I said \u2013 a very sensitive nose and he was able to, if you fart, he could tell you what you ate. Tim Ferriss: Wow. That is a great party trick. Erik Vance: It is. It\u2019s a great party trick and I talked to his wife and she was really wonderful. And she talked about she was born in Iowa, met him in Alaska when he was a mountain climber, and then ended up moving back to Iowa with him for this very interesting career \u2013 and she had a great sense of humor about the whole thing. And she was the one who told me \u2013 and also talked about how he used to smell when she first met him, he\u2019s this great mountain climber and he smells great and now it\u2019s this different reality. We all got to grow up someday, I guess. Tim Ferriss: Now, you mentioned the former Satan worshipper turned evangelical earlier. You are a scientist turned journalist but you were raised Christian Scientist? Is that right? Or was it more one of your parents? Or both? Erik Vance: Did you just compare Satan worshipping to Christian Sci? Tim Ferriss: No. That\u2019s probably what the internet\u2019s going to say. I was trying to do a clumsy transition with the theme of religion which didn\u2019t really work out \u2013 which is why I usually avoid talking about religion. Erik Vance: I didn\u2019t mean to bust your balls on that \u2013 it\u2019s just that that\u2019s funny. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s okay. Busting my balls is fine. Erik Vance: I did. I grew up in Christian Science and, actually, I didn\u2019t even really realize it was all that weird until you get older and you start thinking back on your childhood. But I didn\u2019t go to a doctor until I was 18 years old, I think, was the first time and I remember being bewildered by the whole thing. But Christian Science is this really weird interesting philosophy \u2013 it\u2019s also a religion \u2013 but it\u2019s this thing that people don\u2019t often think about because there are not as many as they used to be. But it\u2019s a fascinating religion that basically says\u2026 it\u2019s like the Matrix \u2013 it says that all you see isn\u2019t real and that\u2019s it\u2019s actually a construct of your mind and, if you change your mind, you change your body. So it\u2019s a lot about really deep belief that what you\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t true \u2013 whatever, this cold that you\u2019re experiencing or arthritis that you\u2019re feeling \u2013 it\u2019s not real. It\u2019s just a construct of your mind which is whacky when you think about it and imagine growing up in that. It\u2019s a little weird. Tim Ferriss: I had at least one of my grandparents \u2013 and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever talked about this \u2013 was very much into Christian Science and, at the time \u2013 I was whatever, let\u2019s call it 5 years old, 6, 7, 8, 9 \u2013 I was like, \u201cOh, something Science. Sure, why not?\u201d And I actually visited the Christian Science Reading Room \u2013 I guess they have these reading rooms in different cities at one point \u2013 [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: Yup. Tim Ferriss: But never really had a ton of direct exposure to it and did go to the doctor a lot because I was a very sick kid growing up. Did you get really sick at any point? Because I\u2019ve seen at least one Law & Order about\u2026 I think they must be Christian Scientists who have a kid with a life-threatening illness or potentially terminal illness, and they won\u2019t let their kid go to the doctor, and then they\u2019re in court, and it\u2019s very dramatic. Did you just dodge all of the bullets or did you have any serious issues? Erik Vance: Well, I should say, I did have a very healthy childhood. I think most Christian Scientists, if a kid breaks his arm, they\u2019re going to go to the doctor. Everyone has their own interpretation. Basic Christian Science says, \u201cThere\u2019s a better way to do this.\u201d It\u2019s not saying you can\u2019t \u2013 technically, it says, \u201cThere\u2019s a better way to heal something,\u201d \u2013 but, culturally, it does end up becoming, \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d That just ends up being the way people interpret it and that can be problematic. And, if you don\u2019t go to doctors, it becomes really scary to go to a doctor \u2013 it becomes really frightening to make that \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s built up into something of a monster. Erik Vance: Yeah. Exactly. You\u2019re told all these things about how doctors\u2026 It\u2019s not\u2026 Don\u2019t get me wrong, a lot of things can happen to you in a doctor\u2019s office \u2013 people do walk out of hospitals sicker than when they went in, it happens \u2013 but, for the most part, we all know that hospitals and doctors, they\u2019re trying to help you. So it is this very difficult thing and it actually came into play before I remember \u2013my most serious disease, I don\u2019t remember it because I was one and a half \u2013 and, at the time, my parents thought it was Legionnaire\u2019s Disease. I\u2019ve since talked to some pediatricians and some scientists and tried to figure out what it was and it\u2019s not clear what I had but it was definitely serious. I was definitely having seizures, and turning colors, and my eyes were rolling back into my head \u2013 it was serious \u2013 and my parents wanted to treat it with Christian Science and it was touch and go. And I ended up having what Christian Science would call a healing \u2013 a rather instantaneous healing \u2013 when my parents, my mom, got to this point where she just got panicked \u2013 I was really, really bad off \u2013 and she called up the practitioner \u2013 who are these people who help Christian Scientists over the phone, like instructors or guides \u2013 and she found a sense of calm. And then she walked back in the room and I was better. Now, you\u2019ve talked on this program about regression to the mean which is when people tend to get better after they\u2019re the worst and it\u2019s easily explainable that way. But, whatever it was, it was a very powerful story for me growing up. I would think about this a lot \u2013 what this had been like for me as this little baby and the fact that I had been saved by God. And it was a very potent narrative that I had about myself which actually leads to the book I wrote because it turns out that\u2019s a very powerful thing for \u2013 and you mentioned placebos in the at very same episode \u2013 it\u2019s a very important part of the placebo effect is your narrative. Tim Ferriss: Right. So the placebo effect has been endlessly fascinating to me and we might as well go there. What was your firsthand experience with the placebo effect? Erik Vance: Well, one could argue my childhood. Tim Ferriss: Right. That\u2019s safe. Erik Vance: Without insulting 100,000 people. I think where it really hit me \u2013 and, actually, I met one of the leading researchers in the country on placebos, who is a former Christian Scientist and we actually went to the same college, Christian Science College \u2013 and that\u2019s how I realized that there was this connection between belief and what\u2019s called expectation and this healing. And so I really got into this thing and one of the earlier reporting trips I did was to the NIH facilities in Bethesda, Maryland. Have you ever been there? Tim Ferriss: I have not. Erik Vance: It\u2019s like a scary place \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s amazing, basically a miracle factory with the amazing research they do there. Tim Ferriss: Why\u2019s it scary? Erik Vance: Well, it\u2019s these big, blocky, industrial-looking brick buildings with smoke coming out of the tops of them. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like East Berlin circa 1970? Erik Vance: Yeah, or some really bad movie in which you go to where Dr. Frankenstein has his college. But it\u2019s actually this amazing place and I went to this cortennial lab, a woman by the name of Malena Kolaka \u2013 she\u2019s an Italian researcher \u2013 and she basically said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to put you in a placebo research trial.\u201d And I didn\u2019t really know what I was getting into but she hooked up these electrodes to my hands and she said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to electrocute you.\u201d And so we figured out where on my pain scale it was at \u2013 I think it was a 7 or a 6, pretty powerful shock. It was so powerful that I twitched \u2013 really, really not comfortable. But then they had another one which was a 1 and it was barely a little pinch. And so every time I saw a green screen, I\u2019d get the 1. Every time I saw a red screen, I get the 7. And she purposely would show me the red and then wait a beat and \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Watch you flinch? Erik Vance: Yeah, because \u2013 and turns out this is really important for the placebo because it\u2019s creating expectation and I\u2019d be like, \u201cOh my god, oh my god,\u201d and you\u2019d twitch. Horrible, horrible. And she\u2019d go back and forth \u2013 zipping back and forth \u2013 and you\u2019d just come to dread that red screen. And then, on the last one, it felt a little like the 1 had been turned up one, like a 2 \u2013 the score I was keeping, I\u2019d call it 2 \u2013 and then the red is obviously like \u201cBuzz,\u201d and I\u2019m twitching. And then she walks in and she says, \u201cThat was a great job. On that last run, I gave you the high one every time.\u201d And it was just\u2026 It wasn\u2019t just that I was convincing myself that I had less pain or that I was\u2026 I had less pain. I was not twitching. I was not fooling myself. I\u2019m not an idiot \u2013 it was less \u2013 and that just blew my mind. Tim Ferriss: So, objectively, the stimulus was the same but your nervous system responded according to your expectations? Erik Vance: Exactly. Basically, my brain filled in the gap. Your brain has expectations and it doesn\u2019t want to be wrong so, when it\u2019s wrong, it just makes up the difference. And, in this case, it released, basically, a morphine drug that\u2019s already in my brain into the brain and it basically covered up the pain. So I basically got a shot of morphine so fast that you almost can\u2019t even measure it \u2013 it happens faster than my brain can realize it\u2019s in more pain than it expected. Because your brain does not want to be wrong \u2013 it does not want to be proven wrong. That just blew me away because I kind of\u2026 in the back of our head, we all think the placebo effect, at its heart, is just gullible people who don\u2019t want to admit what really happened. But these are real biochemical reactions that happen and they are measurable. And I was hooked at that point. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Of course, I\u2019m a human guinea pig, I do all sorts of ill-advised things to myself trying to ensure I don\u2019t mortally wound myself \u2013 but what are some of the other experiments that you\u2019ve done or experiences that you\u2019ve had involving this personally? Now, there\u2019s one that you mentioned that I don\u2019t have any context on that was related to a curse of some type so, immediately, this is of interest to me. I\u2019ve spent a good bit of time in places like Brazil and elsewhere where there\u2019s quite a bit of talk about this type of thing so I would love to just hear the story since I don\u2019t know the first thing about it. Erik Vance: Well, I\u2019ll answer the first question first, then we\u2019ll talk about curses. I spent a lot of time getting burned, poked, prodded. I threw up once because nausea is also a response of the placebos and I did a nausea experiment. I\u2019ve done a lot of these things but the thing that\u2019s really the most useful for placebo research is pain. And, when it comes to placebos, it really affects things like Parkinson\u2019s, like pain, depression, anxiety, Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Basically, all these things are connected by dopamine and a few other chemicals that seem to really respond well to placebos. And that\u2019s why placebos are so interesting because some things have this 60, 70 percent responses and other things, 10, 15 percent so there\u2019s something going on there. And so, because pain \u2013 you can\u2019t cause depression in a laboratory although I might argue, with the current presidential debate, you could cause depression on command, but it\u2019s not something you can really play with \u2013 but pain, you can so I\u2019ve spent a lot of time getting burned, and poked, and all kinds of things because that\u2019s what scientists studying placebo effect study is pain. And there\u2019s actually a lot of implications for that and, when you\u2026 So an example of one of these things \u2013 and I am getting to your question, just circling\u2026 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not rushed. This is not a three-minute morning TV show \u2013 we\u2019ve got time. Erik Vance: Where was I? Oh, yeah, getting\u2026 So there\u2019s a classic experiment where a lot of these things are\u2026 they\u2019re not conscious \u2013 these placebo effects \u2013 and you talked in your other episode about, \u201cOh, now that I know that homeopathy isn\u2019t real or isn\u2019t effective, it doesn\u2019t work on me anymore.\u201d Well, that\u2019s not true for everybody. Actually, for a lot of people, they can\u2019t help the fact that, say, homeopathy or a placebo works. In fact, you can tell someone, \u201cThis is a placebo pill. It is inert,\u201d give it to them, and they\u2019ll still have a placebo response. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the explanation for that? Erik Vance: Well, a lot of it\u2019s classical conditioning. Have you ever taken a Tylenol and been like, \u201cOh my god, my head hurts. Oh my god, I\u2019m in so much pain,\u201d take the Tylenol and be like, \u201cOh god, thank you. Oh, I can think,\u201d? Has that ever happened to you? It happens to me. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Erik Vance: Well, Tylenol doesn\u2019t kick in for 20 minutes so what are you experiencing? [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Right. Erik Vance: And, whether or not it\u2019s real or not, that\u2019s basic classical conditioning. You can condition yourself to have the experience and so you are getting drugs \u2013 they\u2019re just drugs that are already in your head. They\u2019re not from the outside. And so, for some people, it doesn\u2019t matter what you tell them, it\u2019s subconscious \u2013 their brain\u2019s going to do it to them whether you want them to or not. And one of the people who\u2019s studying this, she does this \u2013 she uses fake faces but they flash at you so quickly you can\u2019t recognize them but your brain does. And one of those faces is attached to more pain and the other is attached to less pain. And so you see these faces and your brain goes, \u201cMore pain,\u201d and it responds. Your conscious brain can\u2019t tell the difference between these two faces but your unconscious brain sees it, knows what\u2019s about to come. And this is, again \u2013 in this case, it was burning pain \u2013 but it was pain. And that\u2019s what underlies a lot of this stuff and some of the really exciting research going on right now is looking at the unconscious nature of placebo effects and they may follow a totally different path. It may be like Google Maps where they overlap on a couple roads but they diverge a lot but it\u2019s a whole different thing and it\u2019s really beyond our reach. And one of our big questions that comes up is, \u201cWell, are some people able to tap into this and other people are not?\u201d So I mentioned that you have high pain, you have low pain. Right? Well, the low pain is obviously a placebo effect. You\u2019re getting the same pain \u2013 the same stimulus \u2013 but your brain prepares you. Your brain changes it so your experience is different and so there\u2019s low pain which is like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t feel any pain on this one because I saw a certain face,\u201d and that\u2019s the placebo response. But there\u2019s also the high pain \u2013 the higher pain than, actually, you should be feeling and your brain\u2019s like, \u201cOh my god, this is going to be very, very painful.\u201d That\u2019s called the nocebo response. Tim Ferriss: No-cebo, right. Erik Vance: Exactly. And almost every study that looks at placebos, you also have a nocebo piece of that equation but nocebos are actually really hard to study and they\u2019re really unethical to study in the way that we want to. It\u2019s like you want to give someone a drug and be like, \u201cThis is going to make you really, really sick,\u201d or, \u201cThis is going to kill you,\u201d and you can\u2019t do that. Tim Ferriss: IRB doesn\u2019t like to approve that kind of stuff? Erik Vance: Exactly. That has been tried and it has not worked out. So you talk to these scientists and some of them are like, \u201cOh, man, I understand this is unethical but, man, I\u2019d really like to know.\u201d Tim Ferriss: I know back in the good old days, with K-Hill and those folks, could fast subjects for 40 days. You can\u2019t do that with mice for\u2026 I don\u2019t think you can even exceed 72 hours now. Ah, science. Erik Vance: Yeah, and that\u2019s the thing. There were these great stories I was never really able to verify about people with being told they were having cigarettes being put on their backs and all these terrible things they did to prison inmates to test the nocebo. Basically, whatever\u2026 this thing didn\u2019t really have a name back then but, yeah, you used to be able to do that kind of stuff. So nocebos are a little thin on researching. When I was writing this chapter, it was hard to fill it out. You got so much of this really interesting stuff in there and nocebos are definitely more powerful than placebos. If I want to train you on a placebo response, we\u2019ve got to do it a bunch of times so that you really get it down that this is less pain. If I want you to have a nocebo response, I just have to tell you, \u201cThis is going to hurt. This is really going to hurt. Get ready,\u201d and your brain\u2019s just wired for fear. So that\u2019s cool but I needed more so I really started getting into these ideas about superstition and how you can really cause bad things to happen in your life just through expectation \u2013 just through belief. And real belief \u2013 you can\u2019t half-ass these things. You really have to feel it. And, before long, I came to curses and I had these amazing things that have happened to people in Haiti \u2013 there\u2019s stories of people dying from being cursed. In Haiti, obviously, the zombie is a well-known phenomenon that\u2019s fully understood \u2013 there\u2019s only been three zombies that have really been documented and none of them are recent. Tim Ferriss: Okay, I have to pause for a second. Now, I saw, I think, \u201cThe Serpent and the Rainbow\u201d which I thought was a great movie when I saw it \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen it, probably in 13 years but what characterizes a zombie in the clinical sense, at this point? Erik Vance: Well, unfortunately, there haven\u2019t been any that have been recent and a couple of them actually got written up in the Journal of Science\u00a0\u2013 or, no, was it The Royal Academy of Sciences? There\u2019s been some papers and, mostly, they\u2019re debunked. But a zombie is someone who has clearly some kind of brain damage that causes them to shuffle and lose contact with reality and become a very different sort of person the way we think of the classic zombie. They obviously don\u2019t eat brains. But this is a very, very old myth that\u2019s really tied into the history of Haiti. And there have been a couple documented cases but it\u2019s the \u201930s and then we don\u2019t have a lot of details. So there\u2019s a couple theories and one of them is in \u201cThe Serpent and the Rainbow.\u201d It talks about these puffer fish venom that can cause a catatonic state. And the other idea is, basically, a zombie is created when you give someone a magic potion, you put them underground, you bury them and then you unearth them and they\u2019re a zombie and one of the theories is maybe that there\u2019s oxygen deprivation. But another theory is that maybe it\u2019s just the cumulative power of everyone\u2019s expectations on this right now \u2013 that you do it to yourself. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Or speaking in tongues \u2013 same thing, maybe? Erik Vance: Same idea. The power\u2026 And this is some of the latest research that\u2019s coming out \u2013 and keep an eye out for The National Geographic\u00a0in December, I\u2019ve got a story on this \u2013 shows that peer pressure can boost the placebo effect beyond anything that you can imagine. This is a hugely important part of the placebo effect. And so the nocebo effect, it could be in there, too \u2013 other people\u2019s expectations can affect your body in a very real way. So I get to this point and I\u2019m like, \u201cI really want to experience this. What is that\u2026? Can I\u2026?\u201d I don\u2019t believe in curses. That was my problem is I don\u2019t believe in these things. I believe in the power of the mind. So how can you create that kind of belief? I wanted to have that kind of belief. You know how it is. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably feeling the same thing right now. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve always been dying to feel like I\u2019m going to die from curses. Erik Vance: So I started getting into curses so I\u2019m able to talk to what they call brujas or witch doctors and one of the things I learned is the only way to curse someone is you have to tell them they\u2019re cursed. You have to do a curse and then you have to tell them they\u2019re cursed is the only way it works. I found one woman who was like, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to\u2026 I\u2019m so powerful I\u2019ll just kill them from a distance,\u201d but, mostly, they say you have to tell someone they\u2019re cursed. Tim Ferriss: You have to inform them. Right? Erik Vance: Right. Which is such an, in my mind, it\u2019s a nocebo response. It\u2019s a very complicated socially enforced nocebo response. Tim Ferriss: Right. Erik Vance: And just what you just said a couple minutes ago \u2013 \u201cOh, I\u2019ve always wanted to get cursed,\u201d \u2013 there is something, even if you don\u2019t believe in curses, there is something off-putting about being cursed. And so I just wanted to know, if I curse myself, if it would work \u2013 if I can psych myself out. And so I did \u2013 I hired a guy to curse me and\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Now, hold on just a second. So you have, in Mexico, I would imagine a fairly number of bruja options available. How did you choose this particular person to curse you? Erik Vance: Ah, well, there\u2019s actually a market here. Tim Ferriss: Did you look at his Yelp reviews or something? Erik Vance: I literally\u2026 It was even more than that. I actually talked to the witch doctor market PR people. So there\u2019s actually a market \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of local markets in Mexico and there\u2019s one that focuses on brujeria or witch doctor paraphernalia and they\u2019ve got these weird little burned dolls that have evil power. They\u2019ve got coyote skins. I was assuming these things would all be secret and hidden in some back room somewhere where the dark magic is \u2013 not at all. This is totally upfront. They\u2019re like, \u201cDo you want the \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: The farmer\u2019s market of voo doo dolls? Erik Vance: Exactly. It is literally like that. \u201cOh you want white magic? Go to this person.\u201d \u201cYou want black magic? Go to this person.\u201d And so it\u2019s all out in front and so, before I went in, I had to actually \u2013 we were talking to people \u2013 and they were like, \u201cOh, you have to talk to the PR department and there\u2019s this office in the back of the\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Oh, you weren\u2019t kidding? I thought you were kidding. Erik Vance: I\u2019m dead serious. There\u2019s this office in the back of the market and there\u2019s these two guys who hang out there and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m here with National Geographic. I\u2019m doing this.\u201d And they were like, \u201cOkay. Well, sign this paper and yeah, curses, they\u2019re right there,\u201d and, \u201cOkay, there you go. Talk to this guy and this guy, they\u2019re our favorites.\u201d And so we did a little investigating and found out who to talk to and they were the same people that were recommended by the PR people. And so we talked to a couple different people and I chose\u2026 one of them was genuinely scary, I think, and genuinely really believed that she could kill people with her curses and she was out there. And so I didn\u2019t actually go with her because I was afraid she\u2019d find it insulting to have a curse put on myself. And I went to the other guy who kind of got it \u2013 \u201cOh, like a guinea pig? Okay, I guess I can do this even though terrible things can happen but\u2026\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and he was also black magic and knew lots of evil powers but he was a little more willing to go with me on it and so I chose him. And I walked around for a week and a half with a curse over me. Tim Ferriss: And then what? So, A) did anything happen? And B) did you have to get it removed like stitches, later, by the same guy or what happens? Erik Vance: I did. Well, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to change anything \u2013 I was just going to live my life normally, just do what I normally would do. And so I went out and drank half a bottle of scotch with a good friend of mine and I walked home. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m cursed. I have to be careful with cars and stuff like that,\u201d but, at that point, I wasn\u2019t really worried about curses. But the rest of the week went by and I logged every bad thing that happened to me and not really much happened. I started to get cocky and I even went rock climbing \u2013 I\u2019m a big rock climber \u2013 and I even went rock climbing with some friends over the weekend and I was leading \u2013 I was going first \u2013 which is not super dangerous \u2013 I\u2019ve done it many times before \u2013 but it\u2019s not a safe thing to do. And they\u2019re all making fun of me because I was cursed and climbing. But, by the time I got to the end of this, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThis has really been a bust. Nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d I\u2019m kind of psyching myself out but not really and then I went back to get the curse removed and the guy wasn\u2019t there \u2013 he was\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Gone fishing? Erik Vance: Gone fishing, literally. He was like, \u201cOh, yeah, they cursed you. He\u2019s doing some family thing. Come back next week.\u201d So I had another weekend and I\u2019ll never forget \u2013 it was June not this last year but the year before \u2013 and I had another weekend and I was just basically going to be cursed for that weekend. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, whatever. Okay. Nothing happened last weekend. Nothing\u2019s going to happen this weekend.\u201d And, on Saturday night, my wife \u2013 who was pregnant at the time \u2013 starting to feel some painful pangs in her stomach and, by the next morning, it had gotten pretty bad. And we talk to the doctor and the doctor says, \u201cYou need to go to the hospital right now.\u201d And they were worried that it was contractions that were starting \u2013 she was like four months pregnant so these contractions would be lethal at that point. And so we get in the cab and we\u2019re going to the hospital and the only thing that\u2019s going through my head is the curse and it\u2019s never occurred to her but I was just panicked that I had killed my child with a curse. And what\u2019s interesting is how quickly your mind goes there \u2013 how quickly and it\u2019s a logical fallacy that the Romans called the \u201cpropter hoc, ergo hoc,\u201d which is, \u201cif this, then that.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah. \u201cAfter this therefore because of this.\u201d Erik Vance: Yes. Right. Exactly that\u2019s the \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: The correlation versus causation. Erik Vance: Exactly. And it usually comes up in the case of something happening and then you can go backwards in time and find a cause for it and this is the home of the curse. Think of the Kennedy Curse, right? A bunch of Kennedys die in very tragic and strange ways and you can go back and people have looked for causes going back to Ireland and one of his ancestors stepping on a ferry house. Because, once you have the result, then you can go back and find the cause and causes seem to be real at that point and that\u2019s exactly why, as a man of science, I believe in logic but my brain went there so fast when the shit hit the fan. I was suddenly convinced that, \u201cThis is going to happen and I would never forgive myself if\u2026\u201d And it would always been in the back of my mind that I had done this. And it turned out, we went to the hospital and there was an excruciating couple minutes where they couldn\u2019t find a heartbeat and\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Oomph. Erik Vance: Yeah. And then they did and it turned out the baby was fine. It was some bad tacos from the day before \u2013 a good friend of mine\u2019s going away party \u2013 and she was okay. And I learned that day that my baby \u2013 when they did the sonogram \u2013 that my baby was a boy and I was sitting in the room laughing at these medical texts and I just realized what a wonderful day it had become. It was actually Father\u2019s Day. That Sunday was my first Father\u2019s Day and I just realized that this thing that was a curse had suddenly become a blessing. And it\u2019s such a construct of what you see and that these things only have power when you give them power and it happens fast. Tim Ferriss: So I have a follow up to that: did you go back to the absent witch doctor and get it removed ever? Erik Vance: I did. I\u2019m a man of science but just\u2026 Tim Ferriss: How could it hurt? Erik Vance: How could it hurt? And I followed his instructions \u2013 he had me burn a candle and do some other \u2013 he blew some smoke on me \u2013 and the curse was lifted. And \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Did you tell him what happened? Was he like, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t want to kill your kid but I wanted to just shoot a warning shot to let you know this stuff\u2026\u201d Erik Vance: I didn\u2019t, actually. I didn\u2019t tell him. I thought it might weird him out if he thought that he may have\u2026 Because I see this as being \u2013 this is \u201cpropter hoc, ergo hoc\u201d \u2013 this is me looking for a cause for something that happened. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Erik Vance: But he wouldn\u2019t have seen it that way and I think he would have\u2026 I was afraid that he might feel weird about having caused something like that. So I didn\u2019t \u2013 I just said, \u201cSome bad things happened, some interesting things happened. It was very potent. The rate of my electric toothbrush stopped working that week because of these things.\u201d Tim Ferriss: It was a practice curse. Erik Vance: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So a few questions about placebo. Right? There are a couple things that come to mind that I\u2019ve always been curious about. No. 1 is \u2013 well, actually, I\u2019ll get to the evolutionary question. But the first is you look at the nocebo effect which I assume, in most cases, is an inert substance in the case of, say, ingestibles or some relatively plain vanilla inactive control of some type. But, \u201cIt\u2019s going to make you nauseous, it\u2019s going to hurt you, it\u2019s going to burn you,\u201d whatever it might be. In the case of placebo, we have the same thing. Right? We might have sugar pills, we might have some type of relatively inert substance in the case, again, of ingestibles. Are there examples or is there evidence to suggest that, if you have negative expectations, even if you consume a tried and true clinically tested drug, for instance, that does work, that you can negate the effects of that medicine \u2013 if you expect to die, if you expect to get worse? Is there any evidence to suggest that you can interfere with something that has already been statistically proven to work if you have negative expectations? Erik Vance: Absolutely. Yeah. And that\u2019s actually a misconception about placebos. Yes, the easiest way to measure them is with an inert substance but they exist with everything \u2013 like I mentioned the Tylenol. You can have placebos on top of active drugs and it\u2019s really a great question \u2013 how do you compare the placebo effect for an inert drug versus the placebo effect for an active drug? Because there is one on top of there and there are nocebo effects, too. And this is the thing that I keep trying to drive home is a lot of this is tied to bedside manner and how doctors interact with you. And it can be as high as 30 percent so, a doctor, if he\u2019s going to be a jerk to you, he\u2019s throwing away 30 percent of his cure on top of what he\u2019s giving you \u2013 and that\u2019s a really rough approximation \u2013 those numbers aren\u2019t really worked out yet \u2013 but it\u2019s a substantial boost that you can get. And you can also erode the effectiveness of a drug. It\u2019s been played with \u2013 actually, in some of the earliest placebo experiments were with dental patients and they would tell them they were either getting painkillers and they weren\u2019t\u2026 They also told them they were getting something that would make them worse and they did\u2026 Tim Ferriss: \u201cWe\u2019re injecting something to make this root canal worse. Enjoy.\u201d Erik Vance: Yeah, \u201cTo make this thing worse.\u201d And I think they were all recovering dental patients but dentistry actually played a big role in early placebos. So, yeah, there\u2019s no question that you can erode an active treatment with expectation. And there\u2019s even a bigger question that pain scientists are really struggling to understand right now which is does your brain get into certain habits? Do you create these pathways \u2013 think of them like ruts in the road where you can\u2019t get your car out of the rut \u2013 thinking about pain? And are there types of pain that are strictly neurological \u2013 that feel like you have a pain in your knee but it\u2019s actually in your head \u2013 and these may contribute to a huge portion of the chronic pain in our country. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this is something I\u2019ve explored also for myself. I had chronic back pain for a very long time and there were some structural correction with, specifically, gymnastic strength training with this guy named Coach Summer which helped a lot. But I also read a book in which \u2013 I\u2019m blanking on the first name of the author but I believe it\u2019s Sarno, S-A-R-N-O \u2013 and about a half dozen of my close friends who had suffered from chronic back pain credited this book with fixing their back pain. And it effectively focuses on exclusively on expectations and the mind and I had about a week of relief after reading that book. Erik Vance: Really? Tim Ferriss: So go figure. Of course, N of 1 and, if we\u2019re going along the lines of Richard Feynman, the first principal is that you must not fool yourself and you\u2019re the easiest person to fool so a lot of science is trying to prevent experimenters from fooling themselves. But the question that I wanted to ask \u2013 in a case like that where it appears to have, at least ultimately, it had a structural component \u2013 there was an orthopedic issue that I later fixed \u2013 but, as an intervention, the placebo or mental training component seemed to help. This is going somewhere. You mentioned Parkinson\u2019s earlier and that Parkinson\u2019s seems to respond well to placebo \u2013 and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not across all patients but at least a meaningful percentage \u2013 and I\u2019ve read that Alzheimer\u2019s, on the flip side, does not. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019 accurate \u2013 [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: That is. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, if that\u2019s accurate, what is the plausible explanation or mechanism by which one improves and the other does not? And, of course, the experimental designs, I\u2019m sure, are different but I have both Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s on both sides of my family so this is a very personal question for me. And I was speaking with someone who has also been on the podcast \u2013 Peter Attia \u2013 recently and we were talking about Alzheimer\u2019s disease and he was like, \u201cOnce something is really denatured, once the egg turns white, I\u2019m not sure you can reverse it,\u201d \u2013 so it may be a preventative game \u2013 but how does Parkinson\u2019s differ? Is it because it\u2019s mediated by neurotransmitters and you can somehow rig that game with an expectation? Long question, I know, but how do you think about the difference between efficacy of placebo effect in Parkinson\u2019s versus Alzheimer\u2019s? Erik Vance: That\u2019s a really great question. Yeah, there is one word answer and that\u2019s dopamine. Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 for those who don\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s a deficiency usually caused by\u2026 it\u2019s usually goes down to substantia nigra in your brain and it\u2019s the part that produces the dopamine and monitors these systems that\u2026 it\u2019s a deficiency in this chemical. Now, this chemical, not only does it affects your movement \u2013 which is why Parkinson\u2019s patients tend to shake \u2013 but it also affects reward systems. It\u2019s very much in tune with reward systems. You get a jolt of dopamine when someone says, \u201cHey, you just won a million dollars,\u201d \u2013 jolt of dopamine. It tends to feel good and then, downstream, the things that it triggers also make you feel good. It\u2019s all around a positive chemical that is related to reward. So what is placebo if not reward? An expectation is an expectation of reward. So, basically, it just so happens that Parkinson\u2019s is mediated by a chemical that happens to be really important in placebos. And that\u2019s the only answer that I can give you right now is that it just so happens to be the right chemical that it affects your movement but it also has this other role and, because of that\u2026 And that happens with a lot of these different chemicals like CCK which is a chemical that affects the nocebo response and it also affects your stomach and so it may be one of the reasons why Irritable Bowel Syndrome responds so well to placebos. And that simple fact plays a huge role. And dopamine\u2019s just one of these big, big chemicals in your brain \u2013 it has its fingers in everything. And there is not a mechanism like that in Alzheimer\u2019s that lends itself to a placebo effect. That\u2019s not to say that a placebo doesn\u2019t exist in Alzheimer\u2019s but it\u2019s much easier to explain with statistical explanations like your regression of the mean and it also may damage the fundamental parts of your brain that you need in order to have \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: To exert the results or to exert the placebo effect upon oneself? Erik Vance: That same argument has been made for autism \u2013 it\u2019s definitely not settled. I have lately seen some really interesting studies in autism and placebos and I know a couple of the top scientists are turning their attention to it right now. People have often said that for years \u2013 that autism is the same way \u2013 but there is a degenerative element to Parkinson\u2019s that is not like Alzheimer\u2019s but\u2026 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Sure. Erik Vance: There was a degenerative but what\u2019s amazing is the placebo effect, I\u2019ve seen it almost reverse that. It\u2019s amazing. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s wild. [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: You got to be aware of where that dopamine\u2019s coming from but I have seen people\u2026 In the book and also in the story coming out in December, I talk about a gentleman who was really struggling ten years and, today, I think he just climbed Half-Dome this year. Tim Ferriss: With Parkinson\u2019s? Erik Vance: With Parkinson\u2019s. Tim Ferriss: Now, so this, I guess begs the question \u2013 and there may not be, I don\u2019t expect a miracle answer to this \u2013 but placebo effect, most people would think of being tricked or tricking oneself. Right? So, if you wanted to proactively use the placebo effect and you have a parent or grandparent with Parkinson\u2019s and you wanted to help them or they wanted to help themselves, what do you do? Erik Vance: Well, first of all, I think it\u2019s very important Feynman and all these other folks who say you can\u2019t deceive yourself as a scientist \u2013 that\u2019s very important. As a patient, throw it out the window, man. Tim Ferriss: Right. Erik Vance: Deceive away. You obviously want to be careful. That\u2019s the $64,000 question. Right? That\u2019s what everyone wants to know is, \u201cHow can I use this?\u201d and the answer that I\u2019ve come up from a childhood in Christian Science and years of studying this is we already do. There\u2019s a lot of options out there for using placebos. And it\u2019s different for everyone \u2013 some people, it\u2019s some product you buy. It\u2019s interesting, if you look at placebos across different cultures, in France, suppositories placebos work better than better placebos. Don\u2019t ask me why \u2013 I\u2019ll let you draw your own conclusions. In Britain, foul tasting ones work better. And, in Parkinson\u2019s patients, actually, I\u2019ve seen studies that, if you take a pill, I think you get about an average of 15 percent more movement \u2013 more mobility. And, if you have a surgery, a fake surgery, it\u2019s 25. Tim Ferriss: The sham surgery research is so fascinating. Erik Vance: Yes. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Just for people listening, if you have never looked at this stuff, do some Googling around sham surgery, sham surgery experiments, and you find people who have legitimate structural fuckups in their knees who get fake surgeries where they get opened up \u2013 and they\u2019re under general anesthesia so they\u2019re knocked out \u2013 and they wake up, they\u2019re sutured together, and they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, Doc, my knee feels so much better,\u201d even months later. It\u2019s fascinating. Erik Vance: What\u2019s hilarious about those \u2013 and these are very common in placebo in Parkinson\u2019s research \u2013 a Parkinson\u2019s researcher told me that the greatest breakthrough in Parkinson\u2019s research has been the sham surgery. But, when you do these surgeries, the doctors, they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re doing the real one or the sham until the moment of. And they get the card and it says, \u201cThis is the real one,\u201d and then they have to actually sit and wait for the entire surgery to be over for a sham surgery because you can\u2019t walk out of the room early and have the patient\u2019s family out there watch you come out after five minutes to go play Candy Crush or something like that. You have to sit in there. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u201cEasiest surgery ever. Huge success, guys. Go get a sandwich \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a while before he wakes up.\u201d Erik Vance: Exactly. You can\u2019t do that. And they\u2019ve thought these things through because, in today\u2019s connected age, these patients find each other, and they compare stories, and they can unblind a study if you figure out that your doctor walked out of your surgery five minutes after it started. So it\u2019s really tricky and I\u2019ve sat in on some of these kinds of surgeries and, in Parkinson\u2019s, it is stunning what can happen with these. So, yeah, I was saying there\u2019s different things that resonate with different people \u2013 maybe it\u2019s space-age technology, maybe it\u2019s ancient aestheticism. There\u2019s lots of different ways that you can get in touch with your expectations but the thing is that this is not hope \u2013 this is belief. And this is the thing in Christian Science that I remember growing up. People don\u2019t say, \u201cGod will heal me.\u201d People say, \u201cGod already healed me. I just can\u2019t see it yet,\u201d which are two \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: And that\u2019s a very different thing. Right? Erik Vance: Very different things. Expectation is triggered by a certain level of certainty. Now, these are great questions as to whether it\u2019s the same for everybody \u2013 whether certain people are just talented with their own expectation \u2013 but you really have to believe. Tim Ferriss: How do you manufacture that, though? If, for instance, and I\u2019m not saying \u2013 because I think we all overestimate how logical we are in all aspects of our lives, or many of us do \u2013 but, if you\u2019ve tried to train yourself to be hyper rational, how do you do that? Do you just need to become so desperate that you want something to work so your condition has to reach a point of being particularly bad? Or is there another approach? Because I know a lot of scientist and, if I were to try to say, \u201cHey, you have this condition. You can\u2019t seem to figure it out. You should go try acupuncture,\u201d and they\u2019d be like, \u201cEh, looked at the data. Not compelling.\u201d Right? Erik Vance: Right. If you want to really make a doctor or scientist uncomfortable, ask him this question, especially someone who studies this. No, it doesn\u2019t. The problem with desperation is it \u2013 and, in my book, I lay out three rules of ways not to hurt yourself. And these can be dangerous \u2013 these are life-threatening issues \u2013 and we all know stories about people who have relied on placebo treatments that have then died from a cancer. So desperation is not a great word when I think about these things. It can be fun, though. It can be an exploration and looking into your own mind \u2013 things that might be plausible. And one of my rules I say, \u201cDon\u2019t die or don\u2019t hurt yourself,\u201d and the second one is, \u201cDon\u2019t go broke.\u201d You have to be careful that, in order to create expectation, you shouldn\u2019t need to spend $2,000 a month on something. And so it\u2019s a very tricky \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: And, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt the planet.\u201d Right? Or, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d Erik Vance: That\u2019s the third one. Tim Ferriss: And I read a little snippet about this which is like, \u201cDon\u2019t use endangered animals.\u201d And people might be like, \u201cWhat? Endangered animals?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, don\u2019t go to Chinatown and buy black bear gallbladder extract,\u201d because that\u2019s why there are these horrifying \u2013 I\u2019ve seen video of this \u2013 of farms in China that look like concentration camps where they have bears, and tigers. There are entire facilities with dozens of tigers hooked up to, basically, these extraction machines. It\u2019s really terrible. Erik Vance: It\u2019s not worth it. There are other ways to \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Or shark-fin soup. All that bullshit. Erik Vance: Yeah, the shark fin soup is actually more rotten for sharks but. all these things, there are other ways to engage your expectations. There are other ways to create a placebo response and some of these placebo responses, there is growing evidence \u2013 and I\u2019m having a hard time believing it\u2019s not true \u2013 that some of these thing scan become permanent and you\u2019ve talked a lot about rewiring your brain. Relief that comes from belief can be permanent. I\u2019ve certainly seen it as a Christian Scientist growing up and the trick is finding the thing that does it for you and doesn\u2019t cause damage to you or others. And there are lots of options \u2013 if you want to drink your own urine, go for it. There\u2019s lots of different ways \u2013 whatever resonates for you. These things, it\u2019s a delicate game and maybe you have to experiment with a lot of things. And there\u2019s some people out there who, simply, it won\u2019t work and there\u2019s some really great research going on \u2013 again, with dopamine \u2013 into genetics and the genetics of placebo. And there are some people who it seems just don\u2019t respond. Tim Ferriss: Well, that\u2019s like hypnosis, right? Very much related, probably. Erik Vance: Very much. It\u2019s not as stable \u2013 hypnosis tends to be stable over time \u2013 and placebo tends to change from day to day because your opinions change, all these things change. But it does look like there are some people that, if you exclude them \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t really work yet on an individual basis but, if you take 1,000 people and you look at their genetics, you can take out the 300 who are most likely to respond. And it looks like we might be onto something there. Tim Ferriss: Do you know, off-hand \u2013 what the markers are or what the snips are? Erik Vance: Yes. The most effective one so far \u2013 and there\u2019s about 30 that have been found \u2013 but the most effective \u2013 and I\u2019m writing a piece on this right now \u2013 is COMT. It\u2019s the poorly titled \u201cWarrior-Warrior gene\u201d but it\u2019s involved with an enzyme that eats dopamine. So, if you have a very active enzyme, you have a lot less dopamine. You\u2019ve got a lot more efficient system that takes away all your dopamine. And, if you have a lazy one, you\u2019ve got a lot of extra dopamine laying around and those people tend to respond to placebos at a higher rate. Tim Ferriss: People who have more dopamine laying around? Erik Vance: Extra dopamine laying around. There\u2019s also some personality \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with this \u2013 there\u2019s generalizable personality differences between people who are\u2026 they\u2019re called Met/Mets versus the Vals/Vals \u2013 this is a classic Mendalian breakdown of you\u2019ve got the Met/Mets, the Val/Vals, and the Val/Mets and there\u2019s 50 percent, 25 percent, 15 percent. You do a little box with the whole pea pod thing. Anyway, I\u2019m getting off topic. Tim Ferriss: No, I love it. Which one of those responds best to placebos? Erik Vance: The Met/Mets. Tim Ferriss: Cool. Erik Vance: It looks like there\u2019s been some research out of Harvard and it\u2019s been backed up in some ways that have been published and some that haven\u2019t been published that it\u2019s super new but it\u2019s really exciting. I, personally, am a Met/Val \u2013 I\u2019m a mix \u2013 so I\u2019m the least interesting of the three because I\u2019m somewhere in the middle. I\u2019ve got some lazy ones, I got \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Well, thank god. You could have died from your curse. Erik Vance: I know. Right? If I were Met/Met, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be here. I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done 23 and me. Right, Tim? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I\u2019ve had my full genome sequence but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a Met/Met, or Val/Val, or Met/Val. I do not know that piece. Erik Vance: It\u2019s a great \u2013 and a few others \u2013 and I basically am\u2026 I think the scientist that I talked to called me a \u2013 let\u2019s see, what I was \u2013 a mix all across the board. I didn\u2019t have anything that was\u2026 Except for one \u2013 the coding on the receptor for opioids in my brain is a little hungrier. It attaches to \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Oh, so no recreational heroin for you, then? Erik Vance: Yeah. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s related to addiction so you do have to be careful with that. And that involves people who are\u2026 See, what\u2019s interesting about this is these different chemicals in your brain related to placebos start working with or against each other. Right? Because now you\u2019ve got a big mix and they\u2019re all making noise. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why this is probably so hard to figure out because it\u2019s not one thing. Tim Ferriss: What other conditions that people might recognize \u2013 like IBS, you mentioned related to, I think, CCK, pain, Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 what other conditions seem to respond well to a placebo based on the data? Erik Vance: Depression, anxiety, nausea, and, obviously, addiction is one that seems to be in this camp. A lot of these things are related to dopamine or internal opioids \u2013 endorphins. And there\u2019s a couple \u2013 and I\u2019ve struggled to find really, really good examples of, especially low responders \u2013 but OCD and you also mentioned Alzheimer\u2019s seems to be pretty low responders to placebos. Tim Ferriss: If somebody wanted to make a placebo pill as effective as possible \u2013 so I\u2019ve read bigger pills versus smaller \u2013 anything else? Colors? Any other form factor? Anything that comes to mind? Erik Vance: Are you French? Tim Ferriss: As much as I love suppositories, I don\u2019t know. Maybe that reflects some French blood. I\u2019d have to look into it. Erik Vance: Yeah, there\u2019s no question that the best placebo would be an active placebo and I make the argument in my book that that\u2019s what acupuncture is. An active placebo is a placebo that is inert but causes something to happen in your body. The easiest one is tingling. Tim Ferriss: Like niacin which is why so many bunk supplements include niacin or something called beta alanine because it causes the skin flushing and people are like, \u201cSomething\u2019s happening.\u201d And that, of course \u2013 [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: Oh, I didn\u2019t know that. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, it\u2019s a very common practice. Erik Vance: Oh, that\u2019s great. No, I have to look that up. I\u2019ve turned off all my computers for this interview but I\u2019ll have to remember that. But, yeah, that\u2019s exactly what\u2026 And, if you really want to get into it, there\u2019s actually a lot of debate around it. There is no true placebo because it used to be sugar pills and, sometimes, they use a type of seed corn or it\u2019s not clear if white rice\u2026 If you\u2019re allergic to something like rice, that\u2019s not a placebo \u2013 it\u2019s going to affect you. So there is no real, true placebo so it\u2019s really hard to create a true active placebo or something that\u2019s completely inert except for one effect like your fingers tingling. But, inasmuch as we can do that, we have created some interesting placebos that make your fingers tingle and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh my god, something\u2019s happening,\u201d and then whatever expectation you have gets boosted and that\u2019s a very potent way to enhance a placebo effect. It\u2019s why pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t use active placebos because, if they did, they\u2019d never be able to clear any drugs to the FDA. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Yeah, or they may not get the results they want, either. Erik Vance: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that\u2019s for a separate episode but there\u2019s some really interesting approaches that companies take to ensure that they get the results they want. Erik Vance: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat if you run ten studies, and you fund them all, and then you only submit two? Well, that could be interesting.\u201d Erik Vance: Right. That\u2019s \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: I know we don\u2019t have a ton of time left but I wanted to mention a couple things. The first is I was spending some time with a friend of mine who\u2019s a former surgeon M.D. \u2013 brilliant guy \u2013 and he was talking about how he is an N of 1 to try to use placebo control which is very interesting. So he would \u2013 and, of course, he could have an experimenter blinded this with having, say, his wife do this for him, which he did in few cases \u2013 but he would put these pills or capsules, whatever they might be, and he would encapsulate placebos so he would actually put something relatively inert \u2013 like sugar, or fill in the blank, rice flour, or whatever \u2013 into these capsules, and wrap them in tinfoil, and then number them. And he would keep track \u2013 or his wife would keep track of which were placebo and which were active and then look at the results over time. It\u2019s a lot of work, especially if you\u2019re going to really try to make it defensible. But I guess what I\u2019m wondering is, all the things you\u2019ve learned and been exposed to, how do you currently use that in your life or how do you plan to? Erik Vance: Well, let me just say, if there\u2019s anyone listening that has access to placebo pills, especially different colors and different shapes, give me a call \u2013 because I would love\u2026 they\u2019re actually hard to get ahold of. Most research institutions have their own little recipe\u2013 and you can buy them online but I can\u2019t really tell what\u2019s in those \u2013 so I would love to\u2026 And one of my plans for this book was to be taking tons of placebo pills and I haven\u2019t been able to do that so your friend\u2019s amazing and I\u2019d love to hear what he came up with. So that\u2019s \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: One of them, I\u2019ll tell you, is that he actually got Pez and cut them into the shape \u2013 same color \u2013 of the tablets he was taking. Erik Vance: Oh, that\u2019s beautiful. Tim Ferriss: But that\u2019s also you have to be a necklace craftsman to make that work. Erik Vance: Right. And once you spend that much time looking at this thing, are you really not going to recognize it? And, also, Pez is not a true placebo because sugar, it\u2019s a stimulant a little bit, and so it could also be an active placebo of its own sort. So, yeah, that\u2019s\u2026 I would love to do that and I would love to have someone give me the hookup for, like you said, colors, and shapes have a big role to play in conducting a placebo. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Which colors have you seen in experiments function better than others? Do any come to mind? Erik Vance: Yellow works well for depression \u2013 that\u2019s been pretty well established. Larger tends to work better than smaller up to a certain size and then it just gets uncomfortable. Tim Ferriss: Then you have to just use it as a suppository? Erik Vance: At that point, you might as well. And there have been a few other ones that I\u2019ve seen usually based around marketing \u2013 so like something that looks like Advil \u2013 and that\u2019s hard to tell. I think \u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: Or diamond-shaped and blue? Something like that? That\u2019s Viagra. [Crosstalk] Erik Vance: Yeah. Exactly, that\u2019s right. I have a whole bit in my book about that. Don\u2019t get me started on Viagra. But the other one is gel caps versus just normal white pills and I\u2019ve seen some very small studies that are mixed on that one. But it\u2019s a very personal experience \u2013 it\u2019s hard to lump groups of people into what they like and that\u2019s part of the fun or whatever of the process. For me, I am much more comfortable with the idea that we are suggestible \u2013 this is real \u2013 this is who we are. And this is across\u2026 Part of this project, I went to China, my photographer went to the jungles of Peru and the highlands of Peru, and we went and followed pilgrims in Europe. This is who we are. You almost don\u2019t have to try \u2013 we do this. [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: And that was going to be my evolutionary point \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a vestigial dead-end of some type but, otherwise, there\u2019s a role that this plays. This is something across cultures that we have evolved to retain for some reason. Erik Vance: No question. And we\u2019re not alone \u2013 you can get placebo responses in animals. You can even have immune placebo responses you can program in rats. You can train them to have immune responses \u2013 basically, the same kind of immune response you\u2019d have if you\u2019re getting an organ donated to you and you needed to cut your immune response down. You can do that through expectation in rats. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done in humans. It\u2019s probably going to be, once again, some ethical issues there between that one. So this is fundamental to who we are and there\u2019s a great evolutionary reason why this might be. One can easily imagine that having a group of people fending for themselves, having some members of that group being able to be very clear-eyed, very matter-of-fact, not influenced by suggestion at all might have some benefits for the group. And then having other people who are more suggestible but able to go out after an injury \u2013 after healing themselves with their own expectation of blowing smoke in their face and feeling better \u2013 and being more responsive to healing could definitely have, also, benefit for that community being a genetic population. And there\u2019d be a good reason to have both of those elements in different degrees in a community. Evolution\u2019s all about genetic diversity and it makes a lot of sense to me why we would be programmed this way. And, if you\u2019re going to choose one, you want to be the second one. You want to be able to heal yourself if you can. That\u2019s the thing I take away from this is I think, going in, I would prefer to be the first one but, coming out of this research, man, the second one has a lot of options available to them. They\u2019ve got a lot of different ways that they can harness their own healing. Chronic pain sucks and, if you have extra tools to deal with chronic pain, use them, man. And I think it\u2019s a valuable thing to have. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah, it\u2019s such a fascinating topic and we could talk for hours about your adventures in Mexican fishing villages and with great white sharks and that\u2019ll have to be another time. Erik Vance: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But, Erik, where can people find more about, of course, the book, Suggestible You, more about you? Where can they say hello on the web, or social, or anywhere else? Erik Vance: Sure. So suggestibleyou.com is the book\u2019s website and you can read about upcoming events \u2013 I\u2019m going to be traveling in November and then, again, in January. I\u2019m going to be in the Bay Area, and New York, and Boston. And, if anyone has any events that they\u2019d like to hear more about this kind of stuff, I\u2019m happy to travel. I love sharing this stuff. This stuff is so much fun. You can also check out my other work at erikvance.com and there\u2019s, like you said, I spent some time in Ancient Mayan temples, I\u2019ve chased sharks, I\u2019ve had a weird couple years. And then, if you want to say hi to me, I\u2019m on Twitter at @erikvance \u2013 that\u2019s with a \u201ck.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Erik with a \u201ck.\u201d Erik Vance: Yeah, Erik with a \u201ck.\u201d Tim Ferriss: And, for everybody listening, of course, in the show notes, I will link to everything. As always, you will have links to everything that Erik just mentioned as well as any resources that might have come up in the conversation. Erik, thank you so much for taking the time. This has been a blast. Erik Vance: Okay. Thanks for having me, Tim. Tim Ferriss: And, to everybody listening, as always and until next time, thank you for taking the time to tune into The Tim Ferriss Show.

couldn\u2019t admit that i actually liked", "it was like this, \u201ci know i\u2019m a scientist", "i\u2019m analytical,\u201d and yet i\u2019m doing all this stuff on the side", "and, finally, it was really a matter of a single google search after doing some soul searching where i typed \u201cscience and writing\u201d into a google search and, lo and behold, i found out there\u2019s a whole career for science writers i had never really thought of", "and, when i was a kid, i used to get these little things called \u201czoobooks.\u201d they were these little magazines \u2013 it was like your first mail you ever got when you were a kid \u2013 and i always loved that you have the animals and you learn about the animals and i always wanted to be the guy who was in the magazine who was pulling apart sharks or picking up ants and stuff", "and what i realized in that moment was that i don\u2019t want to be the guy in the magazine \u2013 i want to be the guy making the magazine", "it was the magazine that i really loved \u2013 it wasn\u2019t\u2026 every month, it was something new and that\u2019s what i liked", "and that clicked and then i was off", "now, although you went on the other side of the camera, so to speak, to document, and interview, and research, you\u2019ve also spent a fair amount of time in the field", "right", "yup", "and i don\u2019t know the answer to this question but which came first \u2013 the pig shit or the porcupines", "oh, the porcupines came before the pig shit", "yeah", "okay", "so can you explain the porcupines, please", "well, alright", "so, in my process of trying to be a scientist, one of the places i went was in south africa", "and, basically, i needed a subject for my ph.d", "so i just figured i\u2019d go to south africa, and catch sharks, and do cool stuff, and figure out what i was all about", "why south africa", "i had seen the movie the power of one\u00a0and i really liked it \u2013 i thought it was good \u2013 and so i said, \u201cthat\u2019s where i\u2019m going", "yes.\u201d and that was literally as much thought as i put into it", "i was an idiot as a kid", "and i actually tried to reenact\u2026 i\u2019d go through these slums of south africa \u2013 i\u2019d go jogging and stuff \u2013 thinking that children would chase me and i just had people be like, \u201cdude, you shouldn\u2019t be here", "go away before you get hurt.\u201d so i\u2019m wondering around and i ended up hooking up with this laboratory in cape town \u2013 university of cape town \u2013 and, sometimes, they farmed out their scientists to documentaries and i was still a scientist at that point", "but there was a documentary \u2013 the bbc was doing a program on aardvarks and the animals that live in their burrows so it was really exciting stuff", "sounds like a thriller", "oh, yeah, really", "they had aardwolves and a bunch of other animals that live in these burrows and one of them was porcupines", "so what they needed was a biologist to go and catch the porcupines and habituate them and that was the deal", "and they\u2019ve got this lame kid wandering around their lab who they were just like, \u201chey, let\u2019s just send him because he\u2019s not really doing anything.\u201d and so they sent me into the bush for 10 days with some really interesting characters", "the people who end up signing up for this are a diverse group", "and the guy who was leading the expedition was this guy who spent a lot of time in the bush and was really savvy but really quiet \u2013 didn\u2019t say anything \u2013 and he\u2019d occasionally catch birds with his bare hands and that was about all", "it\u2019s like a praying mantis, although a very large one, yeah", "he\u2019d walk in front of the car and there\u2019d be this bird crouched and he\u2019d just snap out and grab it", "and then there was this other dude who was in the field to detox from his heroin addiction", "and he was a former satan worshiper who had become a born again christian", "and i learned that there\u2019s not actually that different, actually \u2013 he didn\u2019t actually change much, he just switched sides", "just before, he\u2019d say, \u201ci can feel the claws of satan ripping into my chest and parting the skin of my chest and, now, it\u2019s a bad thing", "before, it was a good thing.\u201d before, it was like a massage", "that was saturday night", "it was a normal thing", "and he was really intense and he was still totally focused on satan as a born again christian \u2013 which i never really thought about before but it is a big thing \u2013 and he was just this really interesting guy", "and it was me, and him, and this guy who never spoke and so we spent our days smoking cigarettes and the recovering addict would try to catch fish with a stick and a hook that he had found", "and then, at night, we\u2019d go out with this giant truck and this light \u2013 these rifle-looking flashlights \u2013 and look for porcupines and i learned a few things about porcupines", "we were not prepared \u2013 it was day 3 before someone suggested we get some gloves", "we had blankets \u2013 [crosstalk] somebody forgot the packing list", "well, it didn\u2019t even occur to us", "that\u2019s how bad it was", "it wasn\u2019t that we forgot them \u2013 it just never occurred that we might want them to catch the porcupines", "thank god they called the professionals", "right", "this is who they sent", "and so a quick thing about porcupines \u2013 actually, we learned that there were two primary defense strategies that porcupines have, not surprising to anyone", "one of them \u2013 the surprising one, i suppose \u2013 was that they\u2019re actually really fast, especially when you\u2019ve been smoking cigarettes all day", "actually, when they started to run, you\u2019re just like, \u201coh, shit", "this one\u2019s running,\u201d and they know where their burrow is \u2013 you don\u2019t \u2013 and so we spent a lot of time just tripping over rocks and stuff and then with our hands on our knees just catching our breath and having been dusted by some fat little porcupine", "so that was the first technique", "the second one was more usable which was they stick their head against a tree, put up their quills and go, \u201cgive it your best shot, asshole", "go ahead.\u201d and those were the ones we wanted because we had a little syringe of ketamine \u2013 which was endlessly fascinating to the recovering addict \u2013 [crosstalk] i\u2019m sure \u2013 endlessly fascinating to a lot of people in silicon valley, too", "[crosstalk] yeah", "it\u2019s actually very useful for tranquilizing these animals but what\u2019s interesting \u2013 what i didn\u2019t realize \u2013 is that when you watch a nature film about animals like a porcupine, they didn\u2019t just stumble upon that animal and now they\u2019re filming it", "that\u2019s not the way it works", "someone went out beforehand and prepped the whole scene", "and one of the ways they had to prep it is you have to catch the animal, you drug it, and then you have to put a tracking device inside of it because people watching tv don\u2019t want to see a radio collar", "they don\u2019t want to see a petco harvey collar around the wild porcupine", "right", "yeah, it kind of kills the mood", "it\u2019s not great for the porcupine because he has to go through this surgery but\u2026 so we did that with this one porcupine that they named \u201cuncle erik.\u201d and i never really was clear whether they were making fun of me or it was in honor of me \u2013 it really could have gone either way", "so we did that and then we released uncle erik back into the wild to lick his wounds", "and then the next step is to habituate and so, basically, habituation is one step down from taming", "you basically hang out with the porcupine \u2013 or whatever animal \u2013 for hours, and hours, and hours until they realize that you\u2019re not going to hurt them and they understand that you\u2019re not going to feed them so they just ignore you \u2013 like you\u2019re just another tree or whatever in their environment and they just go about their business \u2013 and that\u2019s when you bring in the film crew", "so it\u2019s not at all like a natural setting, but you might wonder how do you do that", "and, basically, you just have to talk to him for hours and hours on end", "you have to get him used to the human voice because, when people come in to film him, they\u2019ll be talking", "so i sat out there in the middle of the classic empty savannah with the huge sky and scorpions crawling over my feet and just talked to this porcupine", "and what do you talk about \u2013 [crosstalk] uncle erik", "uncle erik and me hanging out together", "and it was me and this porcupine and what do you talk about", "well, you talk to him about your relationship problems", "i was sitting there being like, \u201cand then she told me she didn\u2019t want me to come because her friend was coming but i didn\u2019t know her friend", "okay, let me go back a couple years,\u201d and the porcupine\u2019s sitting there listening to me bitch endlessly about this woman \u2013 [crosstalk] and what is the porcupine doing", "not sitting on a rock, smoking a cigarette, listening, i\u2019m guessing", "no, he\u2019s sitting with his head against the tree \u2013 as you found him in the first place \u2013 with his spines up, going, \u201cplease god, make it stop.\u201d like, \u201cdude, attack me or leave", "i can\u2019t do this forever.\u201d yeah", "\u201care you going to kill me or what", "what is this?\u201d and i remember, one night, i heard the storm coming so i started to go up on a little ridge and look out and i said, \u201cokay, i\u2019ve got an hour or so before it comes.\u201d i come back and then uncle erik\u2019s gone", "i\u2019m like, \u201cokay", "dangit.\u201d so i grab my tracking device and flip it on and he\u2019s not popping up on the scanner at all and this thing has 100-yard radius so he basically cleared 100 yards in less than a minute just to get away from me", "as soon as i turned my back on him, he was like, \u201ci\u2019m gone,\u201d and he just bolted for the horizon", "and i remember that was one of the moments where i really was wondering if i was in the right career or not", "so that was on the field biology side", "i like the \u201cbinoculars\u201d versus \u201cmicroscopes.\u201d actually, the last interviewee or the last few folks i had on interview were on the opposite end of the spectrum so they were actually focused on things like the mechanistic target of rapamycin and looking at m-12 and all this cool stuff", "so the field biology, if we then flash forward, you are learning more about science writing", "what was the program that you were in", "it was actually the university of california santa cruz science writing program which really changed my life", "it\u2019s an amazing program", "who or what lessons had the biggest impact on you through that course \u2013 or program, i should say", "god, there\u2019s so many", "the biggest thing is, as a scientist, you\u2019re trying to be exact", "you need to be precise", "and, as a storyteller, you need to convey a feeling, a sense, because people don\u2019t read journalism or storytelling the same way that they read a scientific paper", "you walk away with an idea \u2013 a couple little facts and an idea", "and you really have to shift your thinking to tell a story to someone \u2013 you have to have characters, you have to have an arc \u2013 and that\u2019s really hard", "that\u2019s something, i think, i learned there but i constantly am trying to perfect because it\u2019s a totally different way", "aside from the little things like no longer using the passive tense and the technical jargon and all that stuff, it\u2019s really about telling a story and it\u2019s not about conveying information", "or it\u2019s about wrapping the information in this sugar-coated delight called a story so that you actually absorb it", "right", "yeah", "who are some\u2026", "well, i guess i have so many questions just because i just finished a book, myself, so writing is on the brain", "what about your writing \u2013 besides, say, using the passive tense less \u2013 improved the most before and after \u2013 going into the program \u2013 coming out of the program", "and the reason i ask is i can think of, for instance, in my own history going back to a class that i took with john mcfee which was called \u201cthe literature of fact\u201d and what he really burned into my brain \u2013 and of course, i won\u2019t even approach 10 percent of the writer he is, ever \u2013 but was how visually he thinks of structure and would almost spec it out on a blackboard or whiteboard like a football player \u2013 it was really fascinating \u2013 or even like a krebs cycle", "it was very, very visual and i\u2019d never thought of architecting something out that way so that was a novel idea that i still rely on, sometimes, when i am stuck", "when i can\u2019t figure out how to structure a story, that\u2019s something that i\u2019ll still do", "are there any tools or any particular changes that you experienced in your own writing", "erik vance:\u00a0yeah, that\u2019s a really good one", "have you ever heard of \u201cthe open notebook?\u201d no, i haven\u2019t", "you should check it out", "it\u2019s a website run by some really good science writers that\u2019s for science writers", "and they have a section that\u2019s just that \u2013 it\u2019s just basically science writers doing schematics of stories they done \u2013 [crosstalk] oh, how cool", "[crosstalk] \u2013 and their favorite stories", "oh, that\u2019s awesome", "it\u2019s great", "i did one where i actually tried to sketch out burkhard bilger\u2019s \u2013 a new yorker story he did on youth rodeo programs", "it\u2019s an amazing story and i just loved it and so i tried to sketch it out and i just sketched out one of my own", "and i loved it \u2013 it\u2019s very visual, it\u2019s very cool", "oh, so it\u2019s people taking a stab at other authors\u2019 or other writers\u2019 work in addition to their own", "in addition to their own, yeah", "exactly", "[crosstalk] oh, that\u2019s cool", "so your experience as a reader and your experience as a writer", "and, of course, i liked his story better than the one i did so it looks a lot better", "you\u2019d like it \u2013 there\u2019s lots of other gems in there, too", "but the thing that i think i really took away \u2013 and i wasn\u2019t expecting from that program \u2013 was a love of characters, of the people\u2026 i tell the story about the porcupines and it\u2019s just a weird thing but you tell a biologist this story and they\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, whatever", "of course, that\u2019s our job.\u201d they\u2019re weird people doing a weird job and that\u2019s what i really fell in love with was the people who do it and how they approach it and so i love\u2026 for the first couple years of my career, i just wrote profiles about amazing scientists who i thought were doing cool stuff and that\u2019s really what i focused on was, \u201cwho are these people who are interesting but also can tell a broader story?\u201d i have something i want to say about gene therapy or chemicals in the atmosphere that geo- asphalt organic compounds that changed the atmosphere of the forest \u2013 i want to tell that story but i really want to tell it through a person", "who is that person who can tell that story", "and what\u2019s their life like", "and what do they think about", "and why are they sitting on top of a tree trying to get these air samples", "how did they end up there", "and that\u2019s what i really fell in love with \u2013 that program \u2013 is the people", "how do you tell a story through a person", "who is that person", "and it\u2019s not always the easiest person to find \u2013 sometimes, they\u2019re the ones you\u2019re not looking for", "so that\u2019s the best tee-up i could imagine for my next question which is\u2026 i should point out these are all new things to me \u2013 i don\u2019t know the answers to these questions", "the first reporting assignment \u2013 you sent me a little note \u2013 is with a guy who studies the smell of pig shit for a living so probably not the mickey mantle you were looking for for ten years", "how did that come to be", "and walk me through\u2026 you graduate from your program, how do you go from there to this assignment", "well, you\u2019re a young, freelance writer \u2013 no one cares what you want to write about", "of course, i want to write about sharks, and important stuff, and \u2013 [crosstalk] and they\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, get in line, buddy.\u201d yeah", "like, \u201cgo ahead", "we\u2019ll look at your pitch", "yeah, definitely.\u201d and so you have to come up with stuff they don\u2019t have and one of those things is chemistry \u2013 not a lot of people covering chemistry", "so i was like, \u201calright, i\u2019ll do some chemistry.\u201d and it actually started, i was working at the chronicle of higher education and i got this little \u2013 [crosstalk] where was that", "the chronicle of higher education in washington, d.c", "oh, i got it", "it\u2019s a magazine that, unless you\u2019re\u2026 it\u2019s highly respected among universities and no one else has heard of it", "but it\u2019s actually really great outlet \u2013 they do great science writing \u2013 so it was my opportunity to really dig in and do cool stories", "but one of those stories that i did that wasn\u2019t that cool was this side 300-word blurb about the chemical in\u2026 have you ever heard of ladybug taint", "that pulls up an incredible image in my head \u2013 i\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not accurate \u2013 so i\u2019m going to say no", "i had the greatest title for this story that they wouldn\u2019t let me use but\u2026 wait, wait \u2013 okay, so now i have to ask what was the headline", "\u201cstinky ladybug taint.\u201d that could be your punk rock band at this point", "right", "okay", "so, no, i don\u2019t know what ladybug taint is", "what is it", "so, if you\u2019re crushing a bunch of\u2026 you\u2019re from the bay area, right", "i am", "well, i live in the bay area, yeah", "you live in the bay area", "well, if you\u2019re crushing up a bunch of grapes in a classic sort of wine crush, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to get one or two ladybugs in there \u2013 it just happens", "and what happens is, if you get one ladybug in a big vat, you get this nice little bell pepper taste", "it\u2019s this nice hint in the background", "if you get two or three, it gets overpowering and it just ruins the whole batch", "and it\u2019s called ladybug taint \u2013 [crosstalk] that must be hard as hell to deal with", "ladybugs\u2026 i don\u2019t know how many people listening have been inside a wine vat but those things are gigantic", "wow", "okay", "and you can\u2019t drop a ladybug in because you don\u2019t know if there\u2019s already one in there so, apparently, it\u2019s a big thing", "anyway, what\u2019s interesting is i was talking to a scientist who discovered the chemical that does this", "it\u2019s an extremely potent, powerful chemical", "i think i calculated that, if you took an olympic-sized swimming pool and you put a teaspoon in there, you\u2019d still be able to taste it", "this stuff is brutal", "so sharks are to blood what humans are the ladybug taint in a swimming pool", "something like that", "if a shark smelled this, he\u2019d be the same way", "he\u2019d be like, \u201cdamn, no, no, no.\u201d anyone\u2026 it\u2019s potent", "and so i started talking to this guy the way i do and i was like, \u201cwow, this is a weird job", "how did you find this?\u201d and he was like, \u201coh, there were some ladybugs in my windowsill and i shook them up in a jar and smelled this thing\u2026\u201d if you ever eat a ladybug \u2013 which i don\u2019t know, tim, have you eaten any ladybugs", "no, i\u2019ve eaten a lot of crickets but no ladybugs", "i need to expand my repertoire, maybe", "there\u2019s a reason why you don\u2019t \u2013 and that\u2019s the reason why they\u2019re red and black, it\u2019s a warning sign \u2013 because they have this chemical and they will unleash it if you try to eat them", "and that\u2019s what it\u2019s for", "so he smelled this thing and he was like, \u201coh my god, i\u2019ve got to figure out what this is.\u201d so i asked him, of course, \u201cwell, what\u2019s your job that you do this?\u201d and he was like, \u201cwell, i don\u2019t actually study ladybugs", "i actually study pig shit.\u201d he didn\u2019t say it like that but that\u2019s what went through my head and i was like, \u201cwait\u2026 like\u2026?\u201d and he specifically focuses on smells and these strong smells and the chemicals that are involved in what we smell", "and so i was like, \u201coh my god, wait, so you study the smell of pig manure?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, the aerosol chemical nature of\u2026\u201d he had a great way to say, \u201ci study smelly pig shit.\u201d and i was like, \u201coh my god", "i have to come out and meet you", "i have to see your laboratory", "this is amazing.\u201d and so i pitched nature\u00a0\u2013 which is a very prestigious journal that also does a lot of science journalism and i\u2019ve done a little work for them before and i\u2019m like, \u201cplease send me out to talk to this guy.\u201d he was in iowa and they were like, \u201calright, you\u2019ve got a couple hundred dollars", "go out there, come back, get the story.\u201d it\u2019s the first time i\u2019ve ever been on assignment to do a story like that", "i was very excited", "and it was the most amazing lab i\u2019ve ever seen", "now, hold on", "what did this\u2026", "so this was your first pitch for a remote assignment", "yes", "okay", "what did the\u2026", "did you do it via letter, or email, or was it via sound \u2013 when you were like, \u201chey boss,\u201d or, \u201chey editor\u2026\u201d i put together a nice email with all the pieces the pitch has to have and it was fascinating jobs", "and i caged around people who have interesting jobs and tried to keep the poop humor to a minimum although i did get the word poop in the journal nature and that i want \u2013 [crosstalk] that\u2019s a win", "[crosstalk] that\u2019s a win", "okay, so you fly out to iowa\u2026", "so i fly out to iowa", "well, actually, i flew out to nebraska because i didn\u2019t actually know the difference between the two so ended up renting a car and driving to iowa because that\u2019s how nervous i was when i was booking my tickets", "so i get out of the car and you can smell it as soon as you get out \u2013 so you can actually smell it", "it\u2019s phenol \u2013 the specific \u2013 it\u2019s often called by people who are into this world, it\u2019s called \u201cband aid\u201d or \u201cfarmyard.\u201d and it\u2019s the first thing you smell when you know there\u2019s a barnyard nearby \u2013 it has a very low vapor pressure so it sticks to anything it touches which means a little bit of dust in the air and it\u2019ll stick to it and it\u2019s the first thing you\u2019ll smell", "it smells a little bit like a band aid and it\u2019s like, \u201coh, there must be a farm nearby,\u201d \u2013 that one", "so that\u2019s what i smell as soon as i get out", "it\u2019s a very agricultural area \u2013 it\u2019s up in ames", "and i go in this guy\u2019s lab and he just introduces me to this world of smells", "everybody\u2019s got these smelly pens everywhere and he has all the students smelling the pens with their eyes closed to try to really hone their ability to recognize smells that are hidden", "and he\u2019s got this device called the \u2013 let\u2019s see if i can do this \u2013 \u201cmultidimensional gas chromatography mass speckle hectometer.\u201d you\u2019ve got one, right", "oh my god", "yeah, i\u2019m looking at one right now next to my tea", "okay", "he\u2019s just amazing", "so you put \u2013 let\u2019s go back to wine \u2013 you pour some wine in this thing and then what it does is gas chromatography", "it cuts the wine up into different pieces, into different chemical components", "and it breaks them up, pushes them aside from each other and it starts giving to you one at a time", "it\u2019s a little cup that goes over your nose at the same time you have a mass spectomy \u2013 a layout of what these things are", "so you\u2019re smelling it, the computer\u2019s analyzing it, and, together, you can find stuff that no one\u2019s found before because our noses are incredibly sensitive", "and so he does this with wine \u2013 and that\u2019s for practice and for some other things \u2013 but, mostly, he focuses on pig shit", "that\u2019s his bread and butter", "and he studies these chemicals that make pig shit really, really bad", "and he\u2019s looking for subtle differences of that one big dropping that\u2019s going to solve it \u2013 and he\u2019s trying to diminish that smell", "i was going to ask\u2026 i assume he\u2019s not making perfume", "now, why is it important to diminish the smell of pig shit", "well, to your point, this guy has the kind of nose that he could be making perfumes \u2013 he\u2019s incredibly sensitive \u2013 but he\u2019s doing this because the idea is, if you can change the food that a pig eats in order to change what comes out from the other end, then you can diminish the smell of a pig farm and that\u2019s actually the biggest obstacle in building new pig farms", "ah, for zoning, and neighbors, and so on or anything like that", "yeah", "exactly", "not just for\u2026 for whole communities that don\u2019t want these things nearby and, if you can diminish that, maybe you can put more of the closer, you can put more pigs in them \u2013 there\u2019s just all kinds of opportunities that can come up once you can give the pig what it needs without having to get the worst chemicals", "and some of these chemicals \u2013 like with the ladybug \u2013 are really, really subtle \u2013 they\u2019re really small", "so that\u2019s what he does and he\u2019s got this device and he hooked me up to it", "and he was worried that i wouldn\u2019t be able to get all of the nuance", "so, rather than leaving the sample and leaving it in for a couple minutes \u2013 ten minutes \u2013 which is what he would do, he left it in overnight so it really was pungent", "when he stuck this thing on my nose, i was\u2026 the first couple things you smell are actually the interesting things \u2013 because it\u2019s broken up into pieces \u2013 and there\u2019s some nice things in pig shit", "there\u2019s wet cardboard, and taco shell, and mushroom \u2013 all these great smells\u2026", "all these things you think are really obnoxious, like wine drinkers, those are real chemicals and you can smell those separately", "i was like, \u201cthis is great,\u201d \u2013 [crosstalk] i\u2019m just imagining saying to a date like, \u201cyou smell wonderful", "it\u2019s like wet cardboard and mushrooms.\u201d yeah", "\u201cwow.\u201d and you don\u2019t know it until you smell it", "you\u2019re like, \u201coh my god, that totally is wet cardboard.\u201d and the pigs haven\u2019t been eating cardboard \u2013 it\u2019s just the same chemical", "and then we get to the sulfates and, man, that\u2019s the business end of pig shit", "i felt like i was getting run over by a manure truck and had my face down one of those port-a-potties for\u2026 it was just horrible", "and, as i mentioned, these things have a low vapor pressure so they stick to whatever they touch \u2013 [crosstalk] yeah, that\u2019s horrible", "\u2013 the inside of your nose", "meaning, for the next three days, everything i ate, everything i smelled\u2026 i was just like, \u201coh god.\u201d had a hint of pig sphincter taint", "exactly", "so you turn in that piece \u2013 was there any turn of phrase or portion of that piece that you were proudest of when you turned it in", "yeah", "that\u2019s the great thing about this job is, if you read my stories \u2013 or any story, any science writer, or any journalist \u2013 you only get a fraction of the experience that they had when they were reporting that story", "and it\u2019s so rich \u2013 i wish there were more ways to share these things \u2013 but the part that i really enjoyed the most was this gentleman had a \u2013 like i said \u2013 a very sensitive nose and he was able to, if you fart, he could tell you what you ate", "wow", "that is a great party trick", "it is", "it\u2019s a great party trick and i talked to his wife and she was really wonderful", "and she talked about she was born in iowa, met him in alaska when he was a mountain climber, and then ended up moving back to iowa with him for this very interesting career \u2013 and she had a great sense of humor about the whole thing", "and she was the one who told me \u2013 and also talked about how he used to smell when she first met him, he\u2019s this great mountain climber and he smells great and now it\u2019s this different reality", "we all got to grow up someday, i guess", "now, you mentioned the former satan worshipper turned evangelical earlier", "you are a scientist turned journalist but you were raised christian scientist", "is that right", "or was it more one of your parents", "or both", "did you just compare satan worshipping to christian sci", "no", "that\u2019s probably what the internet\u2019s going to say", "i was trying to do a clumsy transition with the theme of religion which didn\u2019t really work out \u2013 which is why i usually avoid talking about religion", "i didn\u2019t mean to bust your balls on that \u2013 it\u2019s just that that\u2019s funny", "that\u2019s okay", "busting my balls is fine", "i did", "i grew up in christian science and, actually, i didn\u2019t even really realize it was all that weird until you get older and you start thinking back on your childhood", "but i didn\u2019t go to a doctor until i was 18 years old, i think, was the first time and i remember being bewildered by the whole thing", "but christian science is this really weird interesting philosophy \u2013 it\u2019s also a religion \u2013 but it\u2019s this thing that people don\u2019t often think about because there are not as many as they used to be", "but it\u2019s a fascinating religion that basically says\u2026 it\u2019s like the matrix \u2013 it says that all you see isn\u2019t real and that\u2019s it\u2019s actually a construct of your mind and, if you change your mind, you change your body", "so it\u2019s a lot about really deep belief that what you\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t true \u2013 whatever, this cold that you\u2019re experiencing or arthritis that you\u2019re feeling \u2013 it\u2019s not real", "it\u2019s just a construct of your mind which is whacky when you think about it and imagine growing up in that", "it\u2019s a little weird", "i had at least one of my grandparents \u2013 and i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever talked about this \u2013 was very much into christian science and, at the time \u2013 i was whatever, let\u2019s call it 5 years old, 6, 7, 8, 9 \u2013 i was like, \u201coh, something science", "sure, why not?\u201d and i actually visited the christian science reading room \u2013 i guess they have these reading rooms in different cities at one point \u2013 [crosstalk] yup", "but never really had a ton of direct exposure to it and did go to the doctor a lot because i was a very sick kid growing up", "did you get really sick at any point", "because i\u2019ve seen at least one law & order about\u2026 i think they must be christian scientists who have a kid with a life-threatening illness or potentially terminal illness, and they won\u2019t let their kid go to the doctor, and then they\u2019re in court, and it\u2019s very dramatic", "did you just dodge all of the bullets or did you have any serious issues", "well, i should say, i did have a very healthy childhood", "i think most christian scientists, if a kid breaks his arm, they\u2019re going to go to the doctor", "everyone has their own interpretation", "basic christian science says, \u201cthere\u2019s a better way to do this.\u201d it\u2019s not saying you can\u2019t \u2013 technically, it says, \u201cthere\u2019s a better way to heal something,\u201d \u2013 but, culturally, it does end up becoming, \u201cyou can\u2019t.\u201d that just ends up being the way people interpret it and that can be problematic", "and, if you don\u2019t go to doctors, it becomes really scary to go to a doctor \u2013 it becomes really frightening to make that \u2013 [crosstalk] it\u2019s built up into something of a monster", "yeah", "exactly", "you\u2019re told all these things about how doctors\u2026 it\u2019s not\u2026 don\u2019t get me wrong, a lot of things can happen to you in a doctor\u2019s office \u2013 people do walk out of hospitals sicker than when they went in, it happens \u2013 but, for the most part, we all know that hospitals and doctors, they\u2019re trying to help you", "so it is this very difficult thing and it actually came into play before i remember \u2013my most serious disease, i don\u2019t remember it because i was one and a half \u2013 and, at the time, my parents thought it was legionnaire\u2019s disease", "i\u2019ve since talked to some pediatricians and some scientists and tried to figure out what it was and it\u2019s not clear what i had but it was definitely serious", "i was definitely having seizures, and turning colors, and my eyes were rolling back into my head \u2013 it was serious \u2013 and my parents wanted to treat it with christian science and it was touch and go", "and i ended up having what christian science would call a healing \u2013 a rather instantaneous healing \u2013 when my parents, my mom, got to this point where she just got panicked \u2013 i was really, really bad off \u2013 and she called up the practitioner \u2013 who are these people who help christian scientists over the phone, like instructors or guides \u2013 and she found a sense of calm", "and then she walked back in the room and i was better", "now, you\u2019ve talked on this program about regression to the mean which is when people tend to get better after they\u2019re the worst and it\u2019s easily explainable that way", "but, whatever it was, it was a very powerful story for me growing up", "i would think about this a lot \u2013 what this had been like for me as this little baby and the fact that i had been saved by god", "and it was a very potent narrative that i had about myself which actually leads to the book i wrote because it turns out that\u2019s a very powerful thing for \u2013 and you mentioned placebos in the at very same episode \u2013 it\u2019s a very important part of the placebo effect is your narrative", "right", "so the placebo effect has been endlessly fascinating to me and we might as well go there", "what was your firsthand experience with the placebo effect", "well, one could argue my childhood", "right", "that\u2019s safe", "without insulting 100,000 people", "i think where it really hit me \u2013 and, actually, i met one of the leading researchers in the country on placebos, who is a former christian scientist and we actually went to the same college, christian science college \u2013 and that\u2019s how i realized that there was this connection between belief and what\u2019s called expectation and this healing", "and so i really got into this thing and one of the earlier reporting trips i did was to the nih facilities in bethesda, maryland", "have you ever been there", "i have not", "it\u2019s like a scary place \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s amazing, basically a miracle factory with the amazing research they do there", "why\u2019s it scary", "well, it\u2019s these big, blocky, industrial-looking brick buildings with smoke coming out of the tops of them", "it\u2019s like east berlin circa 1970", "yeah, or some really bad movie in which you go to where dr", "frankenstein has his college", "but it\u2019s actually this amazing place and i went to this cortennial lab, a woman by the name of malena kolaka \u2013 she\u2019s an italian researcher \u2013 and she basically said, \u201cokay, i\u2019m going to put you in a placebo research trial.\u201d and i didn\u2019t really know what i was getting into but she hooked up these electrodes to my hands and she said, \u201cokay, we\u2019re going to electrocute you.\u201d and so we figured out where on my pain scale it was at \u2013 i think it was a 7 or a 6, pretty powerful shock", "it was so powerful that i twitched \u2013 really, really not comfortable", "but then they had another one which was a 1 and it was barely a little pinch", "and so every time i saw a green screen, i\u2019d get the 1", "every time i saw a red screen, i get the 7", "and she purposely would show me the red and then wait a beat and \u2013 [crosstalk] watch you flinch", "yeah, because \u2013 and turns out this is really important for the placebo because it\u2019s creating expectation and i\u2019d be like, \u201coh my god, oh my god,\u201d and you\u2019d twitch", "horrible, horrible", "and she\u2019d go back and forth \u2013 zipping back and forth \u2013 and you\u2019d just come to dread that red screen", "and then, on the last one, it felt a little like the 1 had been turned up one, like a 2 \u2013 the score i was keeping, i\u2019d call it 2 \u2013 and then the red is obviously like \u201cbuzz,\u201d and i\u2019m twitching", "and then she walks in and she says, \u201cthat was a great job", "on that last run, i gave you the high one every time.\u201d and it was just\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just that i was convincing myself that i had less pain or that i was\u2026 i had less pain", "i was not twitching", "i was not fooling myself", "i\u2019m not an idiot \u2013 it was less \u2013 and that just blew my mind", "so, objectively, the stimulus was the same but your nervous system responded according to your expectations", "exactly", "basically, my brain filled in the gap", "your brain has expectations and it doesn\u2019t want to be wrong so, when it\u2019s wrong, it just makes up the difference", "and, in this case, it released, basically, a morphine drug that\u2019s already in my brain into the brain and it basically covered up the pain", "so i basically got a shot of morphine so fast that you almost can\u2019t even measure it \u2013 it happens faster than my brain can realize it\u2019s in more pain than it expected", "because your brain does not want to be wrong \u2013 it does not want to be proven wrong", "that just blew me away because i kind of\u2026 in the back of our head, we all think the placebo effect, at its heart, is just gullible people who don\u2019t want to admit what really happened", "but these are real biochemical reactions that happen and they are measurable", "and i was hooked at that point", "[crosstalk] of course, i\u2019m a human guinea pig, i do all sorts of ill-advised things to myself trying to ensure i don\u2019t mortally wound myself \u2013 but what are some of the other experiments that you\u2019ve done or experiences that you\u2019ve had involving this personally", "now, there\u2019s one that you mentioned that i don\u2019t have any context on that was related to a curse of some type so, immediately, this is of interest to me", "i\u2019ve spent a good bit of time in places like brazil and elsewhere where there\u2019s quite a bit of talk about this type of thing so i would love to just hear the story since i don\u2019t know the first thing about it", "well, i\u2019ll answer the first question first, then we\u2019ll talk about curses", "i spent a lot of time getting burned, poked, prodded", "i threw up once because nausea is also a response of the placebos and i did a nausea experiment", "i\u2019ve done a lot of these things but the thing that\u2019s really the most useful for placebo research is pain", "and, when it comes to placebos, it really affects things like parkinson\u2019s, like pain, depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome", "basically, all these things are connected by dopamine and a few other chemicals that seem to really respond well to placebos", "and that\u2019s why placebos are so interesting because some things have this 60, 70 percent responses and other things, 10, 15 percent so there\u2019s something going on there", "and so, because pain \u2013 you can\u2019t cause depression in a laboratory although i might argue, with the current presidential debate, you could cause depression on command, but it\u2019s not something you can really play with \u2013 but pain, you can so i\u2019ve spent a lot of time getting burned, and poked, and all kinds of things because that\u2019s what scientists studying placebo effect study is pain", "and there\u2019s actually a lot of implications for that and, when you\u2026 so an example of one of these things \u2013 and i am getting to your question, just circling\u2026 i\u2019m not rushed", "this is not a three-minute morning tv show \u2013 we\u2019ve got time", "where was i", "oh, yeah, getting\u2026 so there\u2019s a classic experiment where a lot of these things are\u2026 they\u2019re not conscious \u2013 these placebo effects \u2013 and you talked in your other episode about, \u201coh, now that i know that homeopathy isn\u2019t real or isn\u2019t effective, it doesn\u2019t work on me anymore.\u201d well, that\u2019s not true for everybody", "actually, for a lot of people, they can\u2019t help the fact that, say, homeopathy or a placebo works", "in fact, you can tell someone, \u201cthis is a placebo pill", "it is inert,\u201d give it to them, and they\u2019ll still have a placebo response", "what\u2019s the explanation for that", "well, a lot of it\u2019s classical conditioning", "have you ever taken a tylenol and been like, \u201coh my god, my head hurts", "oh my god, i\u2019m in so much pain,\u201d take the tylenol and be like, \u201coh god, thank you", "oh, i can think,\u201d", "has that ever happened to you", "it happens to me", "sure", "well, tylenol doesn\u2019t kick in for 20 minutes so what are you experiencing", "[crosstalk] right", "and, whether or not it\u2019s real or not, that\u2019s basic classical conditioning", "you can condition yourself to have the experience and so you are getting drugs \u2013 they\u2019re just drugs that are already in your head", "they\u2019re not from the outside", "and so, for some people, it doesn\u2019t matter what you tell them, it\u2019s subconscious \u2013 their brain\u2019s going to do it to them whether you want them to or not", "and one of the people who\u2019s studying this, she does this \u2013 she uses fake faces but they flash at you so quickly you can\u2019t recognize them but your brain does", "and one of those faces is attached to more pain and the other is attached to less pain", "and so you see these faces and your brain goes, \u201cmore pain,\u201d and it responds", "your conscious brain can\u2019t tell the difference between these two faces but your unconscious brain sees it, knows what\u2019s about to come", "and this is, again \u2013 in this case, it was burning pain \u2013 but it was pain", "and that\u2019s what underlies a lot of this stuff and some of the really exciting research going on right now is looking at the unconscious nature of placebo effects and they may follow a totally different path", "it may be like google maps where they overlap on a couple roads but they diverge a lot but it\u2019s a whole different thing and it\u2019s really beyond our reach", "and one of our big questions that comes up is, \u201cwell, are some people able to tap into this and other people are not?\u201d so i mentioned that you have high pain, you have low pain", "right", "well, the low pain is obviously a placebo effect", "you\u2019re getting the same pain \u2013 the same stimulus \u2013 but your brain prepares you", "your brain changes it so your experience is different and so there\u2019s low pain which is like, \u201coh, i don\u2019t feel any pain on this one because i saw a certain face,\u201d and that\u2019s the placebo response", "but there\u2019s also the high pain \u2013 the higher pain than, actually, you should be feeling and your brain\u2019s like, \u201coh my god, this is going to be very, very painful.\u201d that\u2019s called the nocebo response", "no-cebo, right", "exactly", "and almost every study that looks at placebos, you also have a nocebo piece of that equation but nocebos are actually really hard to study and they\u2019re really unethical to study in the way that we want to", "it\u2019s like you want to give someone a drug and be like, \u201cthis is going to make you really, really sick,\u201d or, \u201cthis is going to kill you,\u201d and you can\u2019t do that", "irb doesn\u2019t like to approve that kind of stuff", "exactly", "that has been tried and it has not worked out", "so you talk to these scientists and some of them are like, \u201coh, man, i understand this is unethical but, man, i\u2019d really like to know.\u201d i know back in the good old days, with k-hill and those folks, could fast subjects for 40 days", "you can\u2019t do that with mice for\u2026 i don\u2019t think you can even exceed 72 hours now", "ah, science", "yeah, and that\u2019s the thing", "there were these great stories i was never really able to verify about people with being told they were having cigarettes being put on their backs and all these terrible things they did to prison inmates to test the nocebo", "basically, whatever\u2026 this thing didn\u2019t really have a name back then but, yeah, you used to be able to do that kind of stuff", "so nocebos are a little thin on researching", "when i was writing this chapter, it was hard to fill it out", "you got so much of this really interesting stuff in there and nocebos are definitely more powerful than placebos", "if i want to train you on a placebo response, we\u2019ve got to do it a bunch of times so that you really get it down that this is less pain", "if i want you to have a nocebo response, i just have to tell you, \u201cthis is going to hurt", "this is really going to hurt", "get ready,\u201d and your brain\u2019s just wired for fear", "so that\u2019s cool but i needed more so i really started getting into these ideas about superstition and how you can really cause bad things to happen in your life just through expectation \u2013 just through belief", "and real belief \u2013 you can\u2019t half-ass these things", "you really have to feel it", "and, before long, i came to curses and i had these amazing things that have happened to people in haiti \u2013 there\u2019s stories of people dying from being cursed", "in haiti, obviously, the zombie is a well-known phenomenon that\u2019s fully understood \u2013 there\u2019s only been three zombies that have really been documented and none of them are recent", "okay, i have to pause for a second", "now, i saw, i think, \u201cthe serpent and the rainbow\u201d which i thought was a great movie when i saw it \u2013 i haven\u2019t seen it, probably in 13 years but what characterizes a zombie in the clinical sense, at this point", "well, unfortunately, there haven\u2019t been any that have been recent and a couple of them actually got written up in the journal of science\u00a0\u2013 or, no, was it the royal academy of sciences", "there\u2019s been some papers and, mostly, they\u2019re debunked", "but a zombie is someone who has clearly some kind of brain damage that causes them to shuffle and lose contact with reality and become a very different sort of person the way we think of the classic zombie", "they obviously don\u2019t eat brains", "but this is a very, very old myth that\u2019s really tied into the history of haiti", "and there have been a couple documented cases but it\u2019s the \u201930s and then we don\u2019t have a lot of details", "so there\u2019s a couple theories and one of them is in \u201cthe serpent and the rainbow.\u201d it talks about these puffer fish venom that can cause a catatonic state", "and the other idea is, basically, a zombie is created when you give someone a magic potion, you put them underground, you bury them and then you unearth them and they\u2019re a zombie and one of the theories is maybe that there\u2019s oxygen deprivation", "but another theory is that maybe it\u2019s just the cumulative power of everyone\u2019s expectations on this right now \u2013 that you do it to yourself", "sure", "or speaking in tongues \u2013 same thing, maybe", "same idea", "the power\u2026 and this is some of the latest research that\u2019s coming out \u2013 and keep an eye out for the national geographic\u00a0in december, i\u2019ve got a story on this \u2013 shows that peer pressure can boost the placebo effect beyond anything that you can imagine", "this is a hugely important part of the placebo effect", "and so the nocebo effect, it could be in there, too \u2013 other people\u2019s expectations can affect your body in a very real way", "so i get to this point and i\u2019m like, \u201ci really want to experience this", "what is that\u2026", "can i\u2026?\u201d i don\u2019t believe in curses", "that was my problem is i don\u2019t believe in these things", "i believe in the power of the mind", "so how can you create that kind of belief", "i wanted to have that kind of belief", "you know how it is", "i\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably feeling the same thing right now", "i\u2019ve always been dying to feel like i\u2019m going to die from curses", "so i started getting into curses so i\u2019m able to talk to what they call brujas or witch doctors and one of the things i learned is the only way to curse someone is you have to tell them they\u2019re cursed", "you have to do a curse and then you have to tell them they\u2019re cursed is the only way it works", "i found one woman who was like, \u201cno, you don\u2019t have to\u2026 i\u2019m so powerful i\u2019ll just kill them from a distance,\u201d but, mostly, they say you have to tell someone they\u2019re cursed", "you have to inform them", "right", "right", "which is such an, in my mind, it\u2019s a nocebo response", "it\u2019s a very complicated socially enforced nocebo response", "right", "and just what you just said a couple minutes ago \u2013 \u201coh, i\u2019ve always wanted to get cursed,\u201d \u2013 there is something, even if you don\u2019t believe in curses, there is something off-putting about being cursed", "and so i just wanted to know, if i curse myself, if it would work \u2013 if i can psych myself out", "and so i did \u2013 i hired a guy to curse me and\u2026 now, hold on just a second", "so you have, in mexico, i would imagine a fairly number of bruja options available", "how did you choose this particular person to curse you", "ah, well, there\u2019s actually a market here", "did you look at his yelp reviews or something", "i literally\u2026 it was even more than that", "i actually talked to the witch doctor market pr people", "so there\u2019s actually a market \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of local markets in mexico and there\u2019s one that focuses on brujeria or witch doctor paraphernalia and they\u2019ve got these weird little burned dolls that have evil power", "they\u2019ve got coyote skins", "i was assuming these things would all be secret and hidden in some back room somewhere where the dark magic is \u2013 not at all", "this is totally upfront", "they\u2019re like, \u201cdo you want the \u2013 [crosstalk] the farmer\u2019s market of voo doo dolls", "exactly", "it is literally like that", "\u201coh you want white magic", "go to this person.\u201d \u201cyou want black magic", "go to this person.\u201d and so it\u2019s all out in front and so, before i went in, i had to actually \u2013 we were talking to people \u2013 and they were like, \u201coh, you have to talk to the pr department and there\u2019s this office in the back of the\u2026 oh, you weren\u2019t kidding", "i thought you were kidding", "i\u2019m dead serious", "there\u2019s this office in the back of the market and there\u2019s these two guys who hang out there and they\u2019re like, \u201coh,\u201d and i\u2019m like, \u201ci\u2019m here with national geographic", "i\u2019m doing this.\u201d and they were like, \u201cokay", "well, sign this paper and yeah, curses, they\u2019re right there,\u201d and, \u201cokay, there you go", "talk to this guy and this guy, they\u2019re our favorites.\u201d and so we did a little investigating and found out who to talk to and they were the same people that were recommended by the pr people", "and so we talked to a couple different people and i chose\u2026 one of them was genuinely scary, i think, and genuinely really believed that she could kill people with her curses and she was out there", "and so i didn\u2019t actually go with her because i was afraid she\u2019d find it insulting to have a curse put on myself", "and i went to the other guy who kind of got it \u2013 \u201coh, like a guinea pig", "okay, i guess i can do this even though terrible things can happen but\u2026\u201d and i said, \u201cokay,\u201d and he was also black magic and knew lots of evil powers but he was a little more willing to go with me on it and so i chose him", "and i walked around for a week and a half with a curse over me", "and then what", "so, a) did anything happen", "and b) did you have to get it removed like stitches, later, by the same guy or what happens", "i did", "well, i decided i wasn\u2019t going to change anything \u2013 i was just going to live my life normally, just do what i normally would do", "and so i went out and drank half a bottle of scotch with a good friend of mine and i walked home", "i was like, \u201ci\u2019m cursed", "i have to be careful with cars and stuff like that,\u201d but, at that point, i wasn\u2019t really worried about curses", "but the rest of the week went by and i logged every bad thing that happened to me and not really much happened", "i started to get cocky and i even went rock climbing \u2013 i\u2019m a big rock climber \u2013 and i even went rock climbing with some friends over the weekend and i was leading \u2013 i was going first \u2013 which is not super dangerous \u2013 i\u2019ve done it many times before \u2013 but it\u2019s not a safe thing to do", "and they\u2019re all making fun of me because i was cursed and climbing", "but, by the time i got to the end of this, i\u2019m thinking, \u201cthis has really been a bust", "nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d i\u2019m kind of psyching myself out but not really and then i went back to get the curse removed and the guy wasn\u2019t there \u2013 he was\u2026 gone fishing", "gone fishing, literally", "he was like, \u201coh, yeah, they cursed you", "he\u2019s doing some family thing", "come back next week.\u201d so i had another weekend and i\u2019ll never forget \u2013 it was june not this last year but the year before \u2013 and i had another weekend and i was just basically going to be cursed for that weekend", "i\u2019m like, \u201coh, whatever", "okay", "nothing happened last weekend", "nothing\u2019s going to happen this weekend.\u201d and, on saturday night, my wife \u2013 who was pregnant at the time \u2013 starting to feel some painful pangs in her stomach and, by the next morning, it had gotten pretty bad", "and we talk to the doctor and the doctor says, \u201cyou need to go to the hospital right now.\u201d and they were worried that it was contractions that were starting \u2013 she was like four months pregnant so these contractions would be lethal at that point", "and so we get in the cab and we\u2019re going to the hospital and the only thing that\u2019s going through my head is the curse and it\u2019s never occurred to her but i was just panicked that i had killed my child with a curse", "and what\u2019s interesting is how quickly your mind goes there \u2013 how quickly and it\u2019s a logical fallacy that the romans called the \u201cpropter hoc, ergo hoc,\u201d which is, \u201cif this, then that.\u201d yeah", "\u201cafter this therefore because of this.\u201d yes", "right", "exactly that\u2019s the \u2013 [crosstalk] the correlation versus causation", "exactly", "and it usually comes up in the case of something happening and then you can go backwards in time and find a cause for it and this is the home of the curse", "think of the kennedy curse, right", "a bunch of kennedys die in very tragic and strange ways and you can go back and people have looked for causes going back to ireland and one of his ancestors stepping on a ferry house", "because, once you have the result, then you can go back and find the cause and causes seem to be real at that point and that\u2019s exactly why, as a man of science, i believe in logic but my brain went there so fast when the shit hit the fan", "i was suddenly convinced that, \u201cthis is going to happen and i would never forgive myself if\u2026\u201d and it would always been in the back of my mind that i had done this", "and it turned out, we went to the hospital and there was an excruciating couple minutes where they couldn\u2019t find a heartbeat and\u2026 oomph", "yeah", "and then they did and it turned out the baby was fine", "it was some bad tacos from the day before \u2013 a good friend of mine\u2019s going away party \u2013 and she was okay", "and i learned that day that my baby \u2013 when they did the sonogram \u2013 that my baby was a boy and i was sitting in the room laughing at these medical texts and i just realized what a wonderful day it had become", "it was actually father\u2019s day", "that sunday was my first father\u2019s day and i just realized that this thing that was a curse had suddenly become a blessing", "and it\u2019s such a construct of what you see and that these things only have power when you give them power and it happens fast", "so i have a follow up to that: did you go back to the absent witch doctor and get it removed ever", "i did", "i\u2019m a man of science but just\u2026 how could it hurt", "how could it hurt", "and i followed his instructions \u2013 he had me burn a candle and do some other \u2013 he blew some smoke on me \u2013 and the curse was lifted", "and \u2013 [crosstalk] did you tell him what happened", "was he like, \u201cyeah, i don\u2019t want to kill your kid but i wanted to just shoot a warning shot to let you know this stuff\u2026\u201d i didn\u2019t, actually", "i didn\u2019t tell him", "i thought it might weird him out if he thought that he may have\u2026 because i see this as being \u2013 this is \u201cpropter hoc, ergo hoc\u201d \u2013 this is me looking for a cause for something that happened", "sure", "but he wouldn\u2019t have seen it that way and i think he would have\u2026 i was afraid that he might feel weird about having caused something like that", "so i didn\u2019t \u2013 i just said, \u201csome bad things happened, some interesting things happened", "it was very potent", "the rate of my electric toothbrush stopped working that week because of these things.\u201d it was a practice curse", "exactly", "so a few questions about placebo", "right", "there are a couple things that come to mind that i\u2019ve always been curious about", "no", "1 is \u2013 well, actually, i\u2019ll get to the evolutionary question", "but the first is you look at the nocebo effect which i assume, in most cases, is an inert substance in the case of, say, ingestibles or some relatively plain vanilla inactive control of some type", "but, \u201cit\u2019s going to make you nauseous, it\u2019s going to hurt you, it\u2019s going to burn you,\u201d whatever it might be", "in the case of placebo, we have the same thing", "right", "we might have sugar pills, we might have some type of relatively inert substance in the case, again, of ingestibles", "are there examples or is there evidence to suggest that, if you have negative expectations, even if you consume a tried and true clinically tested drug, for instance, that does work, that you can negate the effects of that medicine \u2013 if you expect to die, if you expect to get worse", "is there any evidence to suggest that you can interfere with something that has already been statistically proven to work if you have negative expectations", "absolutely", "yeah", "and that\u2019s actually a misconception about placebos", "yes, the easiest way to measure them is with an inert substance but they exist with everything \u2013 like i mentioned the tylenol", "you can have placebos on top of active drugs and it\u2019s really a great question \u2013 how do you compare the placebo effect for an inert drug versus the placebo effect for an active drug", "because there is one on top of there and there are nocebo effects, too", "and this is the thing that i keep trying to drive home is a lot of this is tied to bedside manner and how doctors interact with you", "and it can be as high as 30 percent so, a doctor, if he\u2019s going to be a jerk to you, he\u2019s throwing away 30 percent of his cure on top of what he\u2019s giving you \u2013 and that\u2019s a really rough approximation \u2013 those numbers aren\u2019t really worked out yet \u2013 but it\u2019s a substantial boost that you can get", "and you can also erode the effectiveness of a drug", "it\u2019s been played with \u2013 actually, in some of the earliest placebo experiments were with dental patients and they would tell them they were either getting painkillers and they weren\u2019t\u2026 they also told them they were getting something that would make them worse and they did\u2026 \u201cwe\u2019re injecting something to make this root canal worse", "enjoy.\u201d yeah, \u201cto make this thing worse.\u201d and i think they were all recovering dental patients but dentistry actually played a big role in early placebos", "so, yeah, there\u2019s no question that you can erode an active treatment with expectation", "and there\u2019s even a bigger question that pain scientists are really struggling to understand right now which is does your brain get into certain habits", "do you create these pathways \u2013 think of them like ruts in the road where you can\u2019t get your car out of the rut \u2013 thinking about pain", "and are there types of pain that are strictly neurological \u2013 that feel like you have a pain in your knee but it\u2019s actually in your head \u2013 and these may contribute to a huge portion of the chronic pain in our country", "yeah, this is something i\u2019ve explored also for myself", "i had chronic back pain for a very long time and there were some structural correction with, specifically, gymnastic strength training with this guy named coach summer which helped a lot", "but i also read a book in which \u2013 i\u2019m blanking on the first name of the author but i believe it\u2019s sarno, s-a-r-n-o \u2013 and about a half dozen of my close friends who had suffered from chronic back pain credited this book with fixing their back pain", "and it effectively focuses on exclusively on expectations and the mind and i had about a week of relief after reading that book", "really", "so go figure", "of course, n of 1 and, if we\u2019re going along the lines of richard feynman, the first principal is that you must not fool yourself and you\u2019re the easiest person to fool so a lot of science is trying to prevent experimenters from fooling themselves", "but the question that i wanted to ask \u2013 in a case like that where it appears to have, at least ultimately, it had a structural component \u2013 there was an orthopedic issue that i later fixed \u2013 but, as an intervention, the placebo or mental training component seemed to help", "this is going somewhere", "you mentioned parkinson\u2019s earlier and that parkinson\u2019s seems to respond well to placebo \u2013 and i\u2019m sure it\u2019s not across all patients but at least a meaningful percentage \u2013 and i\u2019ve read that alzheimer\u2019s, on the flip side, does not", "i don\u2019t know if that\u2019 accurate \u2013 [crosstalk] that is", "okay", "so, if that\u2019s accurate, what is the plausible explanation or mechanism by which one improves and the other does not", "and, of course, the experimental designs, i\u2019m sure, are different but i have both parkinson\u2019s and alzheimer\u2019s on both sides of my family so this is a very personal question for me", "and i was speaking with someone who has also been on the podcast \u2013 peter attia \u2013 recently and we were talking about alzheimer\u2019s disease and he was like, \u201conce something is really denatured, once the egg turns white, i\u2019m not sure you can reverse it,\u201d \u2013 so it may be a preventative game \u2013 but how does parkinson\u2019s differ", "is it because it\u2019s mediated by neurotransmitters and you can somehow rig that game with an expectation", "long question, i know, but how do you think about the difference between efficacy of placebo effect in parkinson\u2019s versus alzheimer\u2019s", "that\u2019s a really great question", "yeah, there is one word answer and that\u2019s dopamine", "parkinson\u2019s \u2013 for those who don\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s a deficiency usually caused by\u2026 it\u2019s usually goes down to substantia nigra in your brain and it\u2019s the part that produces the dopamine and monitors these systems that\u2026 it\u2019s a deficiency in this chemical", "now, this chemical, not only does it affects your movement \u2013 which is why parkinson\u2019s patients tend to shake \u2013 but it also affects reward systems", "it\u2019s very much in tune with reward systems", "you get a jolt of dopamine when someone says, \u201chey, you just won a million dollars,\u201d \u2013 jolt of dopamine", "it tends to feel good and then, downstream, the things that it triggers also make you feel good", "it\u2019s all around a positive chemical that is related to reward", "so what is placebo if not reward", "an expectation is an expectation of reward", "so, basically, it just so happens that parkinson\u2019s is mediated by a chemical that happens to be really important in placebos", "and that\u2019s the only answer that i can give you right now is that it just so happens to be the right chemical that it affects your movement but it also has this other role and, because of that\u2026 and that happens with a lot of these different chemicals like cck which is a chemical that affects the nocebo response and it also affects your stomach and so it may be one of the reasons why irritable bowel syndrome responds so well to placebos", "and that simple fact plays a huge role", "and dopamine\u2019s just one of these big, big chemicals in your brain \u2013 it has its fingers in everything", "and there is not a mechanism like that in alzheimer\u2019s that lends itself to a placebo effect", "that\u2019s not to say that a placebo doesn\u2019t exist in alzheimer\u2019s but it\u2019s much easier to explain with statistical explanations like your regression of the mean and it also may damage the fundamental parts of your brain that you need in order to have \u2013 [crosstalk] to exert the results or to exert the placebo effect upon oneself", "that same argument has been made for autism \u2013 it\u2019s definitely not settled", "i have lately seen some really interesting studies in autism and placebos and i know a couple of the top scientists are turning their attention to it right now", "people have often said that for years \u2013 that autism is the same way \u2013 but there is a degenerative element to parkinson\u2019s that is not like alzheimer\u2019s but\u2026 [crosstalk] sure", "there was a degenerative but what\u2019s amazing is the placebo effect, i\u2019ve seen it almost reverse that", "it\u2019s amazing", "[crosstalk] that\u2019s wild", "[crosstalk] you got to be aware of where that dopamine\u2019s coming from but i have seen people\u2026 in the book and also in the story coming out in december, i talk about a gentleman who was really struggling ten years and, today, i think he just climbed half-dome this year", "with parkinson\u2019s", "with parkinson\u2019s", "now, so this, i guess begs the question \u2013 and there may not be, i don\u2019t expect a miracle answer to this \u2013 but placebo effect, most people would think of being tricked or tricking oneself", "right", "so, if you wanted to proactively use the placebo effect and you have a parent or grandparent with parkinson\u2019s and you wanted to help them or they wanted to help themselves, what do you do", "well, first of all, i think it\u2019s very important feynman and all these other folks who say you can\u2019t deceive yourself as a scientist \u2013 that\u2019s very important", "as a patient, throw it out the window, man", "right", "deceive away", "you obviously want to be careful", "that\u2019s the $64,000 question", "right", "that\u2019s what everyone wants to know is, \u201chow can i use this?\u201d and the answer that i\u2019ve come up from a childhood in christian science and years of studying this is we already do", "there\u2019s a lot of options out there for using placebos", "and it\u2019s different for everyone \u2013 some people, it\u2019s some product you buy", "it\u2019s interesting, if you look at placebos across different cultures, in france, suppositories placebos work better than better placebos", "don\u2019t ask me why \u2013 i\u2019ll let you draw your own conclusions", "in britain, foul tasting ones work better", "and, in parkinson\u2019s patients, actually, i\u2019ve seen studies that, if you take a pill, i think you get about an average of 15 percent more movement \u2013 more mobility", "and, if you have a surgery, a fake surgery, it\u2019s 25", "the sham surgery research is so fascinating", "yes", "yeah", "just for people listening, if you have never looked at this stuff, do some googling around sham surgery, sham surgery experiments, and you find people who have legitimate structural fuckups in their knees who get fake surgeries where they get opened up \u2013 and they\u2019re under general anesthesia so they\u2019re knocked out \u2013 and they wake up, they\u2019re sutured together, and they\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, doc, my knee feels so much better,\u201d even months later", "it\u2019s fascinating", "what\u2019s hilarious about those \u2013 and these are very common in placebo in parkinson\u2019s research \u2013 a parkinson\u2019s researcher told me that the greatest breakthrough in parkinson\u2019s research has been the sham surgery", "but, when you do these surgeries, the doctors, they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re doing the real one or the sham until the moment of", "and they get the card and it says, \u201cthis is the real one,\u201d and then they have to actually sit and wait for the entire surgery to be over for a sham surgery because you can\u2019t walk out of the room early and have the patient\u2019s family out there watch you come out after five minutes to go play candy crush or something like that", "you have to sit in there", "[crosstalk] \u201ceasiest surgery ever", "huge success, guys", "go get a sandwich \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a while before he wakes up.\u201d exactly", "you can\u2019t do that", "and they\u2019ve thought these things through because, in today\u2019s connected age, these patients find each other, and they compare stories, and they can unblind a study if you figure out that your doctor walked out of your surgery five minutes after it started", "so it\u2019s really tricky and i\u2019ve sat in on some of these kinds of surgeries and, in parkinson\u2019s, it is stunning what can happen with these", "so, yeah, i was saying there\u2019s different things that resonate with different people \u2013 maybe it\u2019s space-age technology, maybe it\u2019s ancient aestheticism", "there\u2019s lots of different ways that you can get in touch with your expectations but the thing is that this is not hope \u2013 this is belief", "and this is the thing in christian science that i remember growing up", "people don\u2019t say, \u201cgod will heal me.\u201d people say, \u201cgod already healed me", "i just can\u2019t see it yet,\u201d which are two \u2013 [crosstalk] and that\u2019s a very different thing", "right", "very different things", "expectation is triggered by a certain level of certainty", "now, these are great questions as to whether it\u2019s the same for everybody \u2013 whether certain people are just talented with their own expectation \u2013 but you really have to believe", "how do you manufacture that, though", "if, for instance, and i\u2019m not saying \u2013 because i think we all overestimate how logical we are in all aspects of our lives, or many of us do \u2013 but, if you\u2019ve tried to train yourself to be hyper rational, how do you do that", "do you just need to become so desperate that you want something to work so your condition has to reach a point of being particularly bad", "or is there another approach", "because i know a lot of scientist and, if i were to try to say, \u201chey, you have this condition", "you can\u2019t seem to figure it out", "you should go try acupuncture,\u201d and they\u2019d be like, \u201ceh, looked at the data", "not compelling.\u201d right", "right", "if you want to really make a doctor or scientist uncomfortable, ask him this question, especially someone who studies this", "no, it doesn\u2019t", "the problem with desperation is it \u2013 and, in my book, i lay out three rules of ways not to hurt yourself", "and these can be dangerous \u2013 these are life-threatening issues \u2013 and we all know stories about people who have relied on placebo treatments that have then died from a cancer", "so desperation is not a great word when i think about these things", "it can be fun, though", "it can be an exploration and looking into your own mind \u2013 things that might be plausible", "and one of my rules i say, \u201cdon\u2019t die or don\u2019t hurt yourself,\u201d and the second one is, \u201cdon\u2019t go broke.\u201d you have to be careful that, in order to create expectation, you shouldn\u2019t need to spend $2,000 a month on something", "and so it\u2019s a very tricky \u2013 [crosstalk] and, \u201cdon\u2019t hurt the planet.\u201d right", "or, \u201cdon\u2019t\u2026\u201d that\u2019s the third one", "and i read a little snippet about this which is like, \u201cdon\u2019t use endangered animals.\u201d and people might be like, \u201cwhat", "endangered animals?\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, don\u2019t go to chinatown and buy black bear gallbladder extract,\u201d because that\u2019s why there are these horrifying \u2013 i\u2019ve seen video of this \u2013 of farms in china that look like concentration camps where they have bears, and tigers", "there are entire facilities with dozens of tigers hooked up to, basically, these extraction machines", "it\u2019s really terrible", "it\u2019s not worth it", "there are other ways to \u2013 [crosstalk] or shark-fin soup", "all that bullshit", "yeah, the shark fin soup is actually more rotten for sharks but", "all these things, there are other ways to engage your expectations", "there are other ways to create a placebo response and some of these placebo responses, there is growing evidence \u2013 and i\u2019m having a hard time believing it\u2019s not true \u2013 that some of these thing scan become permanent and you\u2019ve talked a lot about rewiring your brain", "relief that comes from belief can be permanent", "i\u2019ve certainly seen it as a christian scientist growing up and the trick is finding the thing that does it for you and doesn\u2019t cause damage to you or others", "and there are lots of options \u2013 if you want to drink your own urine, go for it", "there\u2019s lots of different ways \u2013 whatever resonates for you", "these things, it\u2019s a delicate game and maybe you have to experiment with a lot of things", "and there\u2019s some people out there who, simply, it won\u2019t work and there\u2019s some really great research going on \u2013 again, with dopamine \u2013 into genetics and the genetics of placebo", "and there are some people who it seems just don\u2019t respond", "well, that\u2019s like hypnosis, right", "very much related, probably", "very much", "it\u2019s not as stable \u2013 hypnosis tends to be stable over time \u2013 and placebo tends to change from day to day because your opinions change, all these things change", "but it does look like there are some people that, if you exclude them \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t really work yet on an individual basis but, if you take 1,000 people and you look at their genetics, you can take out the 300 who are most likely to respond", "and it looks like we might be onto something there", "do you know, off-hand \u2013 what the markers are or what the snips are", "yes", "the most effective one so far \u2013 and there\u2019s about 30 that have been found \u2013 but the most effective \u2013 and i\u2019m writing a piece on this right now \u2013 is comt", "it\u2019s the poorly titled \u201cwarrior-warrior gene\u201d but it\u2019s involved with an enzyme that eats dopamine", "so, if you have a very active enzyme, you have a lot less dopamine", "you\u2019ve got a lot more efficient system that takes away all your dopamine", "and, if you have a lazy one, you\u2019ve got a lot of extra dopamine laying around and those people tend to respond to placebos at a higher rate", "people who have more dopamine laying around", "extra dopamine laying around", "there\u2019s also some personality \u2013 i\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with this \u2013 there\u2019s generalizable personality differences between people who are\u2026 they\u2019re called met/mets versus the vals/vals \u2013 this is a classic mendalian breakdown of you\u2019ve got the met/mets, the val/vals, and the val/mets and there\u2019s 50 percent, 25 percent, 15 percent", "you do a little box with the whole pea pod thing", "anyway, i\u2019m getting off topic", "no, i love it", "which one of those responds best to placebos", "the met/mets", "cool", "it looks like there\u2019s been some research out of harvard and it\u2019s been backed up in some ways that have been published and some that haven\u2019t been published that it\u2019s super new but it\u2019s really exciting", "i, personally, am a met/val \u2013 i\u2019m a mix \u2013 so i\u2019m the least interesting of the three because i\u2019m somewhere in the middle", "i\u2019ve got some lazy ones, i got \u2013 [crosstalk] well, thank god", "you could have died from your curse", "i know", "right", "if i were met/met, maybe i wouldn\u2019t be here", "i don\u2019t\u2026 i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done 23 and me", "right, tim", "yeah, i\u2019ve had my full genome sequence but i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m a met/met, or val/val, or met/val", "i do not know that piece", "it\u2019s a great \u2013 and a few others \u2013 and i basically am\u2026 i think the scientist that i talked to called me a \u2013 let\u2019s see, what i was \u2013 a mix all across the board", "i didn\u2019t have anything that was\u2026 except for one \u2013 the coding on the receptor for opioids in my brain is a little hungrier", "it attaches to \u2013 [crosstalk] oh, so no recreational heroin for you, then", "yeah", "you\u2019re right, it\u2019s related to addiction so you do have to be careful with that", "and that involves people who are\u2026 see, what\u2019s interesting about this is these different chemicals in your brain related to placebos start working with or against each other", "right", "because now you\u2019ve got a big mix and they\u2019re all making noise", "and so that\u2019s one of the reasons why this is probably so hard to figure out because it\u2019s not one thing", "what other conditions that people might recognize \u2013 like ibs, you mentioned related to, i think, cck, pain, parkinson\u2019s \u2013 what other conditions seem to respond well to a placebo based on the data", "depression, anxiety, nausea, and, obviously, addiction is one that seems to be in this camp", "a lot of these things are related to dopamine or internal opioids \u2013 endorphins", "and there\u2019s a couple \u2013 and i\u2019ve struggled to find really, really good examples of, especially low responders \u2013 but ocd and you also mentioned alzheimer\u2019s seems to be pretty low responders to placebos", "if somebody wanted to make a placebo pill as effective as possible \u2013 so i\u2019ve read bigger pills versus smaller \u2013 anything else", "colors", "any other form factor", "anything that comes to mind", "are you french", "as much as i love suppositories, i don\u2019t know", "maybe that reflects some french blood", "i\u2019d have to look into it", "yeah, there\u2019s no question that the best placebo would be an active placebo and i make the argument in my book that that\u2019s what acupuncture is", "an active placebo is a placebo that is inert but causes something to happen in your body", "the easiest one is tingling", "like niacin which is why so many bunk supplements include niacin or something called beta alanine because it causes the skin flushing and people are like, \u201csomething\u2019s happening.\u201d and that, of course \u2013 [crosstalk] oh, i didn\u2019t know that", "oh, yeah, it\u2019s a very common practice", "oh, that\u2019s great", "no, i have to look that up", "i\u2019ve turned off all my computers for this interview but i\u2019ll have to remember that", "but, yeah, that\u2019s exactly what\u2026 and, if you really want to get into it, there\u2019s actually a lot of debate around it", "there is no true placebo because it used to be sugar pills and, sometimes, they use a type of seed corn or it\u2019s not clear if white rice\u2026 if you\u2019re allergic to something like rice, that\u2019s not a placebo \u2013 it\u2019s going to affect you", "so there is no real, true placebo so it\u2019s really hard to create a true active placebo or something that\u2019s completely inert except for one effect like your fingers tingling", "but, inasmuch as we can do that, we have created some interesting placebos that make your fingers tingle and you\u2019re like, \u201coh my god, something\u2019s happening,\u201d and then whatever expectation you have gets boosted and that\u2019s a very potent way to enhance a placebo effect", "it\u2019s why pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t use active placebos because, if they did, they\u2019d never be able to clear any drugs to the fda", "[crosstalk] yeah, or they may not get the results they want, either", "exactly", "yeah, that\u2019s for a separate episode but there\u2019s some really interesting approaches that companies take to ensure that they get the results they want", "right, exactly", "it\u2019s like, \u201cwhat if you run ten studies, and you fund them all, and then you only submit two", "well, that could be interesting.\u201d right", "that\u2019s \u2013 [crosstalk] i know we don\u2019t have a ton of time left but i wanted to mention a couple things", "the first is i was spending some time with a friend of mine who\u2019s a former surgeon m.d", "\u2013 brilliant guy \u2013 and he was talking about how he is an n of 1 to try to use placebo control which is very interesting", "so he would \u2013 and, of course, he could have an experimenter blinded this with having, say, his wife do this for him, which he did in few cases \u2013 but he would put these pills or capsules, whatever they might be, and he would encapsulate placebos so he would actually put something relatively inert \u2013 like sugar, or fill in the blank, rice flour, or whatever \u2013 into these capsules, and wrap them in tinfoil, and then number them", "and he would keep track \u2013 or his wife would keep track of which were placebo and which were active and then look at the results over time", "it\u2019s a lot of work, especially if you\u2019re going to really try to make it defensible", "but i guess what i\u2019m wondering is, all the things you\u2019ve learned and been exposed to, how do you currently use that in your life or how do you plan to", "well, let me just say, if there\u2019s anyone listening that has access to placebo pills, especially different colors and different shapes, give me a call \u2013 because i would love\u2026 they\u2019re actually hard to get ahold of", "most research institutions have their own little recipe\u2013 and you can buy them online but i can\u2019t really tell what\u2019s in those \u2013 so i would love to\u2026 and one of my plans for this book was to be taking tons of placebo pills and i haven\u2019t been able to do that so your friend\u2019s amazing and i\u2019d love to hear what he came up with", "so that\u2019s \u2013 [crosstalk] one of them, i\u2019ll tell you, is that he actually got pez and cut them into the shape \u2013 same color \u2013 of the tablets he was taking", "oh, that\u2019s beautiful", "but that\u2019s also you have to be a necklace craftsman to make that work", "right", "and once you spend that much time looking at this thing, are you really not going to recognize it", "and, also, pez is not a true placebo because sugar, it\u2019s a stimulant a little bit, and so it could also be an active placebo of its own sort", "so, yeah, that\u2019s\u2026 i would love to do that and i would love to have someone give me the hookup for, like you said, colors, and shapes have a big role to play in conducting a placebo", "[crosstalk] which colors have you seen in experiments function better than others", "do any come to mind", "yellow works well for depression \u2013 that\u2019s been pretty well established", "larger tends to work better than smaller up to a certain size and then it just gets uncomfortable", "then you have to just use it as a suppository", "at that point, you might as well", "and there have been a few other ones that i\u2019ve seen usually based around marketing \u2013 so like something that looks like advil \u2013 and that\u2019s hard to tell", "i think \u2013 [crosstalk] or diamond-shaped and blue", "something like that", "that\u2019s viagra", "[crosstalk] yeah", "exactly, that\u2019s right", "i have a whole bit in my book about that", "don\u2019t get me started on viagra", "but the other one is gel caps versus just normal white pills and i\u2019ve seen some very small studies that are mixed on that one", "but it\u2019s a very personal experience \u2013 it\u2019s hard to lump groups of people into what they like and that\u2019s part of the fun or whatever of the process", "for me, i am much more comfortable with the idea that we are suggestible \u2013 this is real \u2013 this is who we are", "and this is across\u2026 part of this project, i went to china, my photographer went to the jungles of peru and the highlands of peru, and we went and followed pilgrims in europe", "this is who we are", "you almost don\u2019t have to try \u2013 we do this", "[crosstalk] and that was going to be my evolutionary point \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a vestigial dead-end of some type but, otherwise, there\u2019s a role that this plays", "this is something across cultures that we have evolved to retain for some reason", "no question", "and we\u2019re not alone \u2013 you can get placebo responses in animals", "you can even have immune placebo responses you can program in rats", "you can train them to have immune responses \u2013 basically, the same kind of immune response you\u2019d have if you\u2019re getting an organ donated to you and you needed to cut your immune response down", "you can do that through expectation in rats", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done in humans", "it\u2019s probably going to be, once again, some ethical issues there between that one", "so this is fundamental to who we are and there\u2019s a great evolutionary reason why this might be", "one can easily imagine that having a group of people fending for themselves, having some members of that group being able to be very clear-eyed, very matter-of-fact, not influenced by suggestion at all might have some benefits for the group", "and then having other people who are more suggestible but able to go out after an injury \u2013 after healing themselves with their own expectation of blowing smoke in their face and feeling better \u2013 and being more responsive to healing could definitely have, also, benefit for that community being a genetic population", "and there\u2019d be a good reason to have both of those elements in different degrees in a community", "evolution\u2019s all about genetic diversity and it makes a lot of sense to me why we would be programmed this way", "and, if you\u2019re going to choose one, you want to be the second one", "you want to be able to heal yourself if you can", "that\u2019s the thing i take away from this is i think, going in, i would prefer to be the first one but, coming out of this research, man, the second one has a lot of options available to them", "they\u2019ve got a lot of different ways that they can harness their own healing", "chronic pain sucks and, if you have extra tools to deal with chronic pain, use them, man", "and i think it\u2019s a valuable thing to have", "mm-hmm", "yeah, it\u2019s such a fascinating topic and we could talk for hours about your adventures in mexican fishing villages and with great white sharks and that\u2019ll have to be another time", "yeah", "but, erik, where can people find more about, of course, the book, suggestible you, more about you", "where can they say hello on the web, or social, or anywhere else", "sure", "so suggestibleyou.com is the book\u2019s website and you can read about upcoming events \u2013 i\u2019m going to be traveling in november and then, again, in january", "i\u2019m going to be in the bay area, and new york, and boston", "and, if anyone has any events that they\u2019d like to hear more about this kind of stuff, i\u2019m happy to travel", "i love sharing this stuff", "this stuff is so much fun", "you can also check out my other work at erikvance.com and there\u2019s, like you said, i spent some time in ancient mayan temples, i\u2019ve chased sharks, i\u2019ve had a weird couple years", "and then, if you want to say hi to me, i\u2019m on twitter at @erikvance \u2013 that\u2019s with a \u201ck.\u201d erik with a \u201ck.\u201d yeah, erik with a \u201ck.\u201d and, for everybody listening, of course, in the show notes, i will link to everything", "as always, you will have links to everything that erik just mentioned as well as any resources that might have come up in the conversation", "erik, thank you so much for taking the time", "this has been a blast", "okay", "thanks for having me, tim", "and, to everybody listening, as always and until next time, thank you for taking the time to tune into the tim ferriss show"]}
