I\u2019m your host, Tim Ferriss, and on this stage, we\u2019ll be deconstructing world-class performers of all types to uncover and distill the specific tactics they\u2019ve used to overcome doubt, tackle their hardest decisions, and ultimately succeed on their own terms. So, let\u2019s do a show of hands: How many people here think they can tell when someone is lying? About 50 percent. Now, how many of you think you can lie and not get caught? About 30. How many of you \u2013 who raised your hands \u2013 would be willing to bet your entire life savings on being able to do that? All right, six or seven. Well, for the last 30 years, my guest tonight has made his living reading behavior, analyzing the odds, and gambling for his future. In 1989, he became the youngest main event champion at the World Series of Poker, and he holds the world record for most event wins at 14, and he\u2019s still going. Please welcome author, entrepreneur, and professional poker player Phil Hellmuth. I can always tell \u2013 I have a lot of friends who watch poker, and I\u2019m an avid fan, but not a competent player, so we\u2019re not going to be at the same table any time unless I\u2019m a spectator, but I can always tell when you\u2019re on because of the beeping. It draws me into the room. The good news is this isn\u2019t really family programming, so no bleeps in this conversation if it all comes out. I want to talk a little bit about the Scrabble \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: Are you trying to encourage me to swear? Tim Ferriss: This is my \u2013 I\u2019m from Long Island. It might come out on my part. I do drop F-bombs if I get wound up, so I guess that\u2019s a light nudge. Phil Hellmuth: Swearing is part of the lexicon now, and things have changed so much, and so, I do probably swear more than I should even when I\u2019m on the microphone doing events, and someone will always be \u2013 there are always one or two people of the couple-hundred at the event that will be offended. They usually don\u2019t say anything. Tim Ferriss: I mean, that\u2019s a pretty good percentage. That\u2019s a good win. Phil Hellmuth: I have a goal sheet on my mirror and I have a blessing sheet on my mirror. So, in the morning, when I\u2019m brushing my teeth and not paying attention, I see what my lifetime goals are, or my goals for that year, and I also see my blessings. So, I hopefully leave happy because I see the blessings, and focus because I know what my goals are. So, for me, that\u2019s \u2013 [Applause] Let me just wrap this up; this is kind of fun. So, the other day \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not in any rush. We have all the time in the world. Phil Hellmuth: Well, I was at Starbucks three or four months ago, and someone came up to me, and I was really tired, it was a Sunday morning, and I hadn\u2019t slept well, and someone came up to me that doesn\u2019t know me that well or whatever, but I\u2019m polite, and I smiled, and I shook his hand or whatever, and just wanted to get my coffee and get out of there, and then his wife pops up. She\u2019s just glowing. She\u2019s like, \u201cPhil, I\u2019ve got to tell you: I was at your speech. I put my goals up on my mirror, and I accomplish them within two months.\u201d And, she was glowing, and I thought, \u201cWow, I had a profound influence on her life!\u201d And, it just made me feel \u2013 I mean, as a professional poker player at the top of the game, I do things no one else does in the game, and I know that I\u2019m motivated. I\u2019ve known this since maybe 2002, where someone came up to me and they said, \u201cPhil, I was in a coma, and I woke up because I imagined playing you heads-up at poker.\u201d And, this guy sat down in the audience when I was playing heads-up for a world championship, and my wife said, \u201cHe sat down and you won 11 hands in a row. There\u2019s something weird here.\u201d And so, from that moment on, way back in 2002, I realized that I\u2019m motivating, that I\u2019m inspirational to people \u2013 not the stuff that you see on television, although it\u2019s kind of fun to watch me beeping and whatever \u2013 but, me, performing at the top of what I do. You watch some great athletes do things no other great athletes can do. I liked watching Tiger Woods at his prime. I liked watching Michael Jordan. I\u2019m not as big as those guys, but in my industry, it\u2019s kind of fun to see \u2013 \u201cWow! How did Phil know to fold this or move in with this?\u201d So, yeah, I think when I\u2019m achieving the most I can achieve and I\u2019m playing poker like no one else has ever seen, I think that can be inspirational for millions of people that watch it. Tim Ferriss: So, within that period when you were struggling, did you have any particular coping mechanisms or strategies that you used, things to occupy your time that helped you get through that? Phil Hellmuth: Absolutely. A big coping mechanism for me \u2013 and, this applied itself in poker, too \u2013 when you\u2019re young in poker, you\u2019re usually reckless. So, I told you I won the main event \u2013 $750,000.00 for first, right? This is 1989, man. I\u2019d been taking way too many chances, and so, at that point, from there \u2013 yes, I was smart. I bought a penthouse condominium and paid cash for it. Yes, I put aside money for taxes. But, the other $300,000.00, I lost. So, yeah, I ended up with \u2013 I may have bought a couple cars. Beautiful cars, penthouse condominium, but I\u2019m struggling to pay $800.00 a month condo fees. This was a year later. And so, the coping mechanism there is rather than \u2013 it\u2019s not that I\u2019m avoiding the present, it\u2019s that you\u2019re like, \u201cThis is a moment where there\u2019s a lot of rain, so No. 1, I\u2019m going to develop strategies for the next time I have money.\u201d My money management system has to be really solid, and I have to actually apply it and use it. That\u2019s No. 1. No. 2, I would look forward and say, \u201cWhat does it look like in two years?\u201d It looks amazing in two years. And so, in the depths of dealing with some of the worst times, I would take advantage of that down period of that being trodden down to be more focused. How did this happen? How can I play poker better? How can I manage money? Money management\u2019s more important than playing poker. Tim Ferriss: For a poker player, or just in general? Phil Hellmuth: You can ask me about that later, but that\u2019s a very interesting topic. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I will. Phil Hellmuth: But, to go with it \u2013 so, those are the things I would use. Vince Vaughn was talking about this last night. He taught me something that I hadn\u2019t thought about much. When someone\u2019s looking at a flop, they usually haven\u2019t hit it. They\u2019re trying to figure out if they have anything. Tim Ferriss: The flop meaning when the dealer puts the cards down? Phil Hellmuth: When the first three cards come out, yes. But, you have to pay attention to everything that tells a story, and when the next card comes \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Vince was saying if they look at it for a long time, they\u2019re trying to figure out what to make of their hand, whereas if they look at it quickly, then they either have nothing or \u2013 you were talking about it \u2013 potentially a strong position. Phil Hellmuth: That was a great observation on his part. It made me realize how smart he is and increased my respect factor for him because he got it and pointed out something that I hadn\u2019t been paying attention to recently. But, everything adds up. It\u2019s a picture. How much are they betting? When the next card comes off \u2013 now, there are four in the middle \u2013 how much are they betting? When the fifth card comes up, how much are they betting? Are they hesitating because they think, \u201cI have to bluff all in here and I have to man up to do it?\u201d And then, when they bluff, do they put it in right away or do they wait? And then, people try to use things to throw you off, so you have to decipher the whole picture. So, I trust my instincts, and when I\u2019m on, I look great, but I\u2019m just not every day. We film so much poker \u2013 there are days where I\u2019m off, and then a million of the kids watch it, and they say, \u201cPhil sucks at poker, Phil sucks at poker, Phil sucks at poker.\u201d I\u2019ve heard that so often in my life, that I\u2019m not good at poker. It\u2019s crazy to me. It\u2019s because they watch my worst moments. I wonder if I watched this guy who\u2019s criticizing me \u2013 if I watched all of his worst moments \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The blooper reel for somebody else. So, you were talking about when you were at your best. Phil Hellmuth: And, by the way, that can get to me. People were telling me that I wasn\u2019t good at poker, that the game had passed me by, coming into 2010. I \u201csucked\u201d at poker because I hadn\u2019t done anything in a couple of years. Internet forums filled with how bad I was at poker because I\u2019m a big target and because I hadn\u2019t done anything lately, and that\u2019s fair criticism. And then, all of a sudden, 2011 came, and I had three second-place finishes, and everybody was like, \u201cWow,\u201d and then 2012 came, and I won two bracelets, and everybody\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d But, I swear \u2013 I\u2019ll never forget this \u2013 in 2011, they were talking about how I had fallen out of the Top 500 in poker, how I sucked at the game. Exactly three weeks later, I had two second-place finishes, and they were talking about how I was the greatest, which was \u2013all right, what changed? Come on. Tim Ferriss: I was given some advice early on when I was writing because I was getting really thrown for a loop with some criticisms. I remember the first time I got a negative Amazon review \u2013 the very first time. Phil Hellmuth: Bummed you out? Tim Ferriss: I wrote this really logical, compassionate reply \u2013 this long \u2013 I spent hours on this thing, and the guy replied, \u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d and I was like, \u201cOh, the humanity! Why won\u2019t you listen, internet?\u201d Somebody said to me, \u201cYou\u2019re never as bad as they say you are and you\u2019re never as good as they say you are either,\u201d and I was like, \u201cAll right.\u201d Phil Hellmuth: Did you then stop reading reviews? Tim Ferriss: I stopped reading most of them on Amazon, YouTube, and a few places, where it all devolves to Hitler after two pages, you\u2019re like, \u201cHow did it get to Hitler? This is a kitten video.\u201d What I wanted to ask you before I get too far off the rails \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: Wait, so you just gave up? I stopped looking at poker forums in 2001. I just stopped looking. Tim Ferriss: I think you don\u2019t \u2013 There\u2019s how to deal with something and there\u2019s strategically choosing not to deal with it. Sometimes, it\u2019s easier to go where it\u2019s not slippery if you don\u2019t want to slip, right? So, with temptation, with \u2013 it\u2019s a quality problem, but beautiful, smart women swarming around you when you\u2019re in Vegas or something like that \u2013 similarly, I don\u2019t want to have to waste the energy to manage my response to something that isn\u2019t going to be productive anyway, because the good stuff is just going to make my head inflate and the bad stuff probably isn\u2019t even going to be accurate, or it\u2019s going to make me feel terrible. What\u2019s the outcome that I\u2019m looking for? But, what I wanted to ask you \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: Well, my whole life \u2013 to stay with that a second \u2013 my whole life has been \u2013 I would get too inflated with the good stuff; my ego gets all pumped up. I\u2019d get too devastated by the bad stuff. I look back, and I was very defensive in a lot of the videos that you may or may not show, but a lot of these videos are super defensive until 2011, 2012, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWait a minute: I\u2019m the all-time champion. I have all the records. Why am I so defensive?\u201d I think that defensiveness is part of \u2013 maybe it ties in \u2013 I want to be great, and I want everybody to think I\u2019m great at games \u2013 specifically, poker. I think that may drive me. I\u2019m trying to get away from being defensive, but \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s tough. I\u2019m pretty defensive, too. I remember \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: I wrote a tweet today, and I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d Oh, Twitter, Twitter. Tim Ferriss: When Stephen Fry \u2013 a well-known comedian and actor \u2013 opted out on Twitter, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s like too many people have peed in the pool. I\u2019m out of here. I\u2019m taking a break from Twitter.\u201d A gross but useful metaphor. Anyway, I want to talk about one of the times you maybe weren\u2019t at your best. You\u2019ve lost all this money \u2013 just to go back to where we were in your timeline. I\u2019d read about you setting a number of goals, maybe in a taxicab \u2013 am I making this up? There were a few goals. One was the World Series of Poker, I believe. If this is fiction, let me know. The second one \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: Oh, no. I\u2019ve got it from here. So, this was probably \u2013 I was 21, maybe 22, something like that, and I had one of these weird touchpoints where something amazing happens to me \u2013 weird, right? So, I\u2019m playing poker in Madison, Wisconsin. I wake up, and it\u2019s foggy, and there\u2019s snow on the ground, and I\u2019m looking at a $2.00 and $4.00 limit game, but I have $20,000.00. You go to that game, you might make $200.00. What am I doing? So, I go over there, and I\u2019m bored, and there\u2019s no golf courses open, and I can\u2019t find anything fun to do, so to two of the guys from the game, I say, \u201cLet\u2019s go have a drink.\u201d So, I\u2019ve never been a big drug guy, but I smoked pot, and then we go to the bar, and I\u2019m having a drink, and they\u2019re playing pool for $10.00 or $20.00 a game, and it\u2019s 1:00 in the afternoon. I\u2019m having a drink, I\u2019ve smoked pot, and I\u2019m suddenly \u2013 and, they\u2019re arguing about $20.00 at the pool table, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck am I doing with my life? I have to get out of here.\u201d So, I go \u2013 and, I\u2019ll never forget; I opened this door, and boom! The sun is out now, and it\u2019s bouncing off the snow, and it\u2019s a metaphor for what happened at that moment. It was the reality of what happened at that moment. I opened the door, and I saw all the light. It\u2019s coming at me, and it\u2019s bouncing off everything, and I\u2019ve been in some dingy bar. \u201cWow, what is this?\u201d I call for a taxi \u2013 I would never drive when I\u2019m doing something silly like that. I get back to my apartment, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you doing with your life?\u201d The first thing I do \u2013 I have all this positive momentum energy, and I\u2019m like, \u201cThese are my lifetime goals: I\u2019m going to win the main event at the World Series of Poker. If I\u2019m going to be a poker player, I\u2019m going to be the best in the world. I\u2019m going to meet and marry an amazing woman. I\u2019m going to buy a beautiful house. I\u2019m going to buy a beautiful car. I\u2019m going to write a New York Times bestselling book.\u201d So, I said, \u201cThese are my lifetime goals,\u201d and there were six of them. And then, I had all this positive momentum and energy, and I\u2019m like, \u201cIn order to get there, how am I going to do it?\u201d Well, I think of it as a pyramid. First, I have to be able to not smoke pot, not become an alcoholic, manage my money \u2013all these little things are on the bottom row of the pyramid. And then, there\u2019s the next row of the pyramid: Exercise, eating healthy, all this stuff. And, the next row: Make sure that you\u2019re studying the game. All the way to the top. So, I designed a pyramid in that moment in this creative breakthrough I was having, and then I\u2019m like, \u201cActually, I love the concept of a pyramid.\u201d In poker, the money flows up. So, I designed that pyramid in that moment. I was just writing for hours like a madman. At the bottom of the pyramid is all the small-stakes games that might happen at a bar, and then all the home games, then some of the games in Vegas, then some of the big games in L.A. All the money flows up. All the people that have success here come to this level, they dump off the money, or they go up. Most dump off the money. So, the money flows all the way up. If I want to win millions or decamillions playing poker, I have to be up here at the top as a player, and I have to use this pyramid and make sure that I check all the boxes on all these blocks to get there. I came up with the concept \u2013 I\u2019m overwhelming people; I have two pyramids and a lifetime goal list \u2013 and then, I decided it was important to have something on my bathroom mirror, which we talked about a little bit already. And so, that concept came that day. All this amazing, positive momentum \u2013 to me, that was one of the most \u2013 in my autobiography, Poker Brat, that chapter\u2019s called \u201cI Can See the Light.\u201d I just talk about that, and then, I\u2019m devising all of these money management strategies. That was a profound moment for me in my life. Tim Ferriss: What were some of your \u2013 I think this is a really critical component, as you alluded to earlier. What were some of those money management strategies? Phil Hellmuth: Oh, before we \u2013 I\u2019ll come to that, but before I say \u2013 the amazing thing was with all those goals \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The suspense is killing me! Phil Hellmuth: \u2013 with all those goals, I looked \u2013 a year later, my wife found the list. It may be two years later. I\u2019d knocked off five of those lifetime goals already. I\u2019d won the main event. I\u2019d met Kathy. I\u2019d bought this beautiful condominium. I\u2019d bought some beautiful cars. It was amazing how many boxes I\u2019d checked. Now, the bestselling book \u2013 I didn\u2019t know this in \u201904 when I put out Play Poker Like the Pros \u2013 I didn\u2019t know that this would be the one. I just saw the poker wave coming and I put a how-to book out there. I wrote it myself \u2013 we talked about this last night \u2013 it took two months, 1,500 words a day. I put it out there; some guy holds it up on ESPN. He\u2019d played a seven-card low tournament. He\u2019d never played before. Tim Ferriss: What does that mean? What\u2019s a seven-card low tournament? Phil Hellmuth: Basically, the World Series of Poker has a seven-card stud tournament, a hold\u2018em tournament, Omaha \u2013 all these different variations of poker. He\u2019s playing in a seven-card low. He says, \u201cI read Phil Hellmuth\u2019s book,\u201d and he holds it up on ESPN. \u201cI read Phil Hellmuth\u2019s book and I cashed for $17,000.00\u201d Not $1 million, not $2 million, but $17,000.00. Boom! My book hits the bestseller list. [Applause] That\u2019s a lifetime goal. I remember when Harper Collins called me. They somehow \u2013 I guess we had cell phones by then \u2013 they called me and said, \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d I was at the Loew\u2019s Hotel. They said, \u201cOkay, your book just hit the New York Times bestseller list. We just sent a bottle of Dom to your room.\u201d And, it was a how-to list! I just walked around high for weeks because that was one of the last goal that I had to accomplish. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s so many directions we could go, but I\u2019m going to come back to the wealth. Phil Hellmuth: Money management? Tim Ferriss: Yes, sir. So, at that time \u2013 because this is a critical survival skill, foundational for \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: I\u2019m glad you came back to this because I think the people out there should know this. What\u2019s more important: Great poker skills or great money management? Money management. I\u2019ll tell you why. If you have a guy that has poker skills \u2013 let\u2019s do a diagram here \u2013 poker skills of 80 \u2013let\u2019s say poker skills of 90, and you have a guy with poker skills of 80, but the guy with 80 manages money better, he\u2019s going to have a much more comfortable life. He\u2019s going to win his money, he\u2019s going to sit down in the smart games at the right time with the right amount of money, and he\u2019s just going to flow along and pay all of his bills. It\u2019s going to look boring. Some of the outsiders are going to say, \u201cYou\u2019re too conservative.\u201d But meanwhile, look at the guy who has 90 but no money management skills. He loses all his money in one night. Now, he has to borrow money from his friends and loses that, too. Then, he gets staked \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That means someone is bankrolling? Phil Hellmuth: Someone bankrolls him, but he has so much skill that he hits for $500,000.00 in a tournament. His backer gets $250,000.00, but still! Now, he has $250,000.00. Now, he\u2019s back in action, and he has a couple of successful months and runs it up to $400,000.00. But then, over a series of two weeks, he loses the whole $400,000.00, borrows, from all his friends again \u2013 because he paid them back last time \u2013 this time he borrows more, gets staked again \u2013 He can\u2019t pay his bills. That\u2019s a miserable, tough existence. And so, that\u2019s why money management is more important than poker skills. Now, how specifically? I remember a story where my wife thought I was a madman. It was 1997. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m wondering how many stories you have like that, but let\u2019s start with this one. Phil Hellmuth: So, I remember saying, \u201cAs soon as I\u2019m worth $1 million, I\u2019m going to get staked.\u201d That was based on what my house was worth, on stocks \u2013 all the stuff that I had in my life. So, I determined that I\u2019d hit the $1 million mark \u2013 Tim Ferriss: This is in assets? Phil Hellmuth: Yeah, in assets. Call it 1997. I was on the way down. I was like, \u201cAll right, I\u2019m getting staked. I\u2019m going to have Ted Forrest stake me.\u201d People were lining up to stake me; I had pretty good results. So, I was going to have Ted Forrest stake me, and I was celebrating. \u201cHoney, I\u2019m getting staked.\u201d But, I wasn\u2019t celebrating the fact that I was getting staked. I was celebrating the fact that I could hit $1 million in net worth and get staked. No one in history that I have ever heard of had done that, to that point. Everybody else would go, \u201cHey, let\u2019s get $200,000.00 from the house. Let\u2019s sell a car. Let\u2019s sell some stocks.\u201d Not me. So, I was celebrating, and my wife \u2013 I just remember it was in a hotel in San Francisco \u2013 I was like, \u201cYes!\u201d My wife was just staring at me with daggers. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re getting staked and you\u2019re celebrating.\u201d But, that wasn\u2019t the point. The point was I was going to draw this line in the sand, and I did it, and I got staked for the next three, four, or five years \u2013 until 2001. Ted Forrest was great. If I had money due \u2013 my bills were a lot less then; I had $5,000.00 or $7,000.00 a month in bills \u2013 he would just press a button and send me the money. I was getting staked, and I had no worries. I played less; I spent more time with my family at that point. And then, all of a sudden, in 2001, I won $500,000.00 in tournaments quickly, and Ted was entitled to $400,000.00 of it, or whatever, and I was more than happy. He had faith in me, and he made a bunch of money because of me and that was great. But, that\u2019s what discipline it takes to have great money management. And now, today, I have a system where I\u2019ll only risk $10,000.00 a day. [Laughter] Tim Ferriss: You have to look at the percentage, I know. Phil Hellmuth: Look at the percentage! $10,000.00 is not a lot. Tim Ferriss: Kids: Only risk $10,000.00 a day. No, I\u2019m just kidding. It\u2019s a percentage. Phil Hellmuth: I\u2019m proud of that because \u2013 if I could translate to people at home \u2013I don\u2019t know what that would be for someone at home. Take a guess. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not going to take a guess at your net worth; I don\u2019t know. Phil Hellmuth: Forget net worth. Tim Ferriss: I know a little more about liquid assets \u2013 yeah, I would say it \u2013it\u2019s something that you can comfortably lose and not have it materially affect you or your family. Phil Hellmuth: Correct. For me, that was a big step. I implemented this five years ago, and it\u2019s been super successful for me. $10,000.00 doesn\u2019t last too long in the games I play in, but I can\u2019t always tell, when I\u2019ve lost $10,000.00, whether I\u2019m \u2013 the reason I implemented it \u2013 I can\u2019t always tell if I\u2019m playing poorly or if I\u2019m just getting unlucky. There\u2019s always mystery there, mystery surrounding how good you\u2019re playing. And so, I just decided \u2013 for me, it\u2019s been a great system. If I lose it, I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right, I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d I can\u2019t play for 24 hours, or until I wake up. I might as well go to the movies; I might sleep a couple of shifts, watch some movies in the room, chill, and show up fresh the next day. And, there\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t want to lose $10,000.00 today. I just did it yesterday. So, you come up ready to play, and you\u2019ve thought about if you did everything right. That\u2019s been a good system for me for the last five or six years. Tim Ferriss: How would you have reacted had you not won? Phil Hellmuth: I think it would have been devastating, but I would have still had $350,000.00 or $400,000.00. You have to understand: At that point, I was already \u2013 there were four majors per year, and then there were nine World Series. So, that year, there were 11 World Series of Poker championships, and then there three that I really wanted to win which I considered majors. One of them was the Bicycle Club main event, and I won that one in August 1988. I\u2019d already won one of the majors and was all over the poker press, so to win that was the greatest moment \u2013 maybe the greatest moment in my poker career \u2013 just to win that. It\u2019s nice to back it up 13 more times. Tim Ferriss: So, speaking of backing it up, at what point before 1989 \u2013 I know we\u2019re doing a little Memento-style, chronologically fragmented approach here, but bear with me. I don\u2019t know why I keep looking at you; you\u2019re very pensive, which I appreciate \u2013 the thinking hard. The question is: When did Johnny show you his hand? This is what I\u2019ve read; maybe this is also just myth. You saw something, or at least you told him you saw something. Phil Hellmuth: The interesting thing about this \u2013 this is more for poker people. I\u2019ll try to make it so everybody can understand it. The blinds were $5,000.00 and $10,000.00 when we were heads-up. The first thing I had whispered to Johnny Chan \u2013 we\u2019d played 32 minutes \u2013 I\u2019d whispered at the beginning, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to play perfect and get lucky to beat me.\u201d Now, if the cameras had been working in those days, that\u2019s one that would have been played a lot, and people would have said, \u201cBoy, that kid\u2019s cocky.\u201d But, I whispered it just so Chan could hear, and exactly four hands before, I had had the ace and seven of diamonds \u2013 I still remember \u2013 and I opened for $35,000.00. So, you have to think in terms of how much money you\u2019re raising, okay? That\u2019s three and a half times the big blind. That\u2019s how they look at it these days. A 3.5 is pretty big. But then, Chan called the $35,000.00 and raised $130,000.00 more \u2013 almost twice the size of the pot. These are unheard-of big numbers. A mental note went off. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to play within this hand,\u201d but he\u2019s stepping on the aggression now. I can see he\u2019s putting a lot of money; he\u2019s become very aggressive. I\u2019m going to fold this. I don\u2019t like folding it because everybody else in the world back then would have put in a lot of money with any ace, especially ace-seven suited. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fold this,\u201d but I noticed he\u2019d changed his style. My mind was completely encompassed in how I was going to win this. Exactly four hands later, I looked at two black nines, and it was like the script was already written. I\u2019m going to open for $35,000.00, he\u2019s going to raise $130,000.00, and I\u2019m going to pile in $700,000.00, just that quick. Sometimes, scripts are written from hands. So, I did that, then he did it. I waited; I didn\u2019t want to give anything away. I didn\u2019t want to show any excitement. I didn\u2019t want to do anything that would change him from doing what he was going to do. He re-raised $130,000.00. The minute those chips hit the pot, I said, \u201cI\u2019m all in.\u201d He started the hand with $600,000.00. Boom! I\u2019m raising all your chips right back on you. It was two black nines \u2013 a pretty strong hand. He started studying and thinking, and I thought to myself if he had ace-king, ace-queen, ace-jack, or ace-ten, he would have put money in already. Those hands are very close \u2013 maybe a 12 to 10, 13 to 10 favorite. I don\u2019t want to play a pot where I\u2019m only 12 to 10 or 13 to 10. I don\u2019t want to leave it to chance. I also thought that he would call with any pair above tens instantly. So, at that point, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhat does he have? Do I want him to call or not?\u201d I had been around poker long enough where I didn\u2019t want to influence the action by acting strong or acting weak. I said, \u201cJust let things play out and see where it lands.\u201d But, if he had king-queen, I didn\u2019t want him to call. I\u2019m only a small favorite. When he had the ace-seven of spades, I was kind of surprised \u2013 also, he would have called right away with eights or sevens, which is a great position for me. When he had ace-seven of spades, I was kind of surprised. It was a little weaker, and I think he decided, \u201cThis kid is tough.\u201d He and I had faced off in the 1988 World Series. He\u2019d seen me. We\u2019d faced off in August at the tournament; I won when I won the major at the Bicycle Club that I just mentioned. And so, he knew that I was there. He\u2019d even come out in Esquire magazine in January and said, \u201cThis kid is going to win the main event as soon as he learns to tuck it in a little bit.\u201d That was more fuel for my fire, reading myself in Esquire magazine. That was a big thing, man. Back then, nobody talked about poker. So, when called with ace-seven of spades, I was kind of surprised, but again, I thought, \u201cAll right, he\u2019s going to find a way to outdraw me.\u201d It\u2019s not that I felt the negativity. It\u2019s more like you have to be prepared for him to hit it. He\u2019s been lucky, you\u2019ve watched him get lucky, so when that six of spades hit, I was \u2013heaven. I was going to tell you about the question that Antonio asked me that you asked me about last night. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s jump into it. Phil Hellmuth: Okay. Let\u2019s see. [Laughter] Another subject switch for Phil \u2013 get used to it. Tim Ferriss: Antonio is a mutual friend, very savvy investor and entrepreneur in his own right. Phil Hellmuth: We can say his last name, right? Tim Ferriss: Sure, Antonio Gracias. Phil Hellmuth: Antonio Gracias \u2013 amazing guy. He\u2019s on the board of Tesla, SpaceX \u2013really great friends with Elon Musk. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s how we met originally. Phil Hellmuth: Yeah, we met at an Elon Musk party. How lucky were we to be there? It was like, \u201cHow did they lose bracelets and we ended up with \u2013?\u201d Tim Ferriss: Well, especially me. This guy \u2013 come on. 14 bracelets. Phil Hellmuth: No, it\u2019s pretty amazing to be there. But anyway, Antonio Gracias \u2013 last year, my ego was flying out of control. I won a bracelet, and then for three months straight, I was losing \u2013 maybe ten sessions. I\u2019ve never lost more than three sessions for years that I can remember. I lost ten sessions in a row. My ego\u2019s flying out of control. I\u2019m more tempted than ever by these beautiful, smart women, so I\u2019m treading on this ego path, and I\u2019m having fun every day, just popping from \u2013 I\u2019m doing events in New York, Chicago \u2013 appearances. I just feel like \u2013I felt like I was attracting everybody, and I\u2019m just having a blast with it. I\u2019m in the Hamptons, and all this fun stuff is happening. It\u2019s leading to a little bit of a car wreck for me, and then Antonio Gracias asked \u2013 he said, \u201cPhil, how many bracelets would you have without your wife?\u201d And, I wanted to answer selfishly, \u201cWell, I might have more because I would have played more tournaments,\u201d but I knew that wasn\u2019t true. I was like, \u201cNine?\u201d He said, \u201cYou have 14. Nine? You really think you\u2019d have that many without her?\u201d I thought, \u201cWow. Maybe seven?\u201d The minute that that connected with me, this egotistical guy walking around \u2013 not mistreating anybody, nice to everybody; I\u2019ve learned that. Respect everybody; I\u2019ve learned that. But still, flying high in his own jet stream \u2013thump, boom. A week later, my iPhone picture was \u2013 I had two iPhone pictures; one on the outside, which was Clinton and me, and the other one on the inside, which was George Bush and me. So, don\u2019t come at me \u2013 I said Democrats and Republicans. But, I erased one and put my wife up, and I erased the other and I put my wife and sons up over the next two weeks. As I did it, I thought, \u201cWow, this is the Antonio effect.\u201d I think if Elon\u2019s ever struggled \u2013 which, of course, he never has \u2013 I think Antonio\u2019s helped him out. He\u2019s just been amazing. And so, just that one question \u2013 I felt like it rerouted my life a little bit, and then in four sessions in my home game, I won so much money. I won four times what I\u2019d lost over the last three months, and I became more solidly entrenched in the process. That was key: Family first. Then, you have your fun movie star life where all these great things happen, but family first. So, it was significant for me \u2013 just that question. [Applause] Tim Ferriss: So, on a related note \u2013 this is a question from Facebook, Melanie Nelson: \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret to his long-lasting marriage?\u201d I\u2019d just love to know \u2013 I\u2019m going to tweak it a little bit. What other things have you done? What other things have you worked on? How have you worked on making it this long? It\u2019s a rarity in this world, at least in the U.S. Phil Hellmuth: It\u2019s rare. It\u2019s not always easy. I think one thing is that I still have great desire for my wife. I still lust after her. Honey, I love you! [Laughter] And \u2013it\u2019s important to keep that. For me, my wife was probably ready to leave me in \u201999. \u201cWho the hell is this guy? I married a diamond in the rough. He\u2019s still in the rough!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re still a piece of coal! You were supposed to change and grow! You\u2019re a smart guy!\u201d Her threatening to leave me devastated me, but my wife is smart. She didn\u2019t do anything drastic. We went into therapy together, and I worked really hard at all my faults: To much ego, too self-centered, too narcissistic, blah blah blah \u2013 a lot of stuff. It was really important to work on, and I saw the truth in all of that, and I was thinking about it every week. We\u2019d spend an hour and a half, two hours, three hours a week figuring out how things I might have done wrong to her \u2013 mostly unintentionally \u2013 Sometimes, I\u2019d be trying to do her a favor, but of course, sometimes, women think differently from men. Men are from Mars, women are from Venus, right? So, I learned a lot about that stuff, and it changed my primary relationship. So, I grew for a year and a half \u2013 massive growth. What I found is that all the other relationships changed. One of my friends \u2013 John Bonetti \u2013 was crying in the car. \u201cPhil, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve listened to me in ten years.\u201d Crying! I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s my wife\u2019s effect.\u201d So, in changing the primary relationship, and focusing and becoming better, it made me smarter and wiser in all my other relationships, and it helped my poker, too. Poker is a people game. So, at the end of it, I was like, \u201cWell, she made me into a better man and we ended up coming out like this.\u201d And so, I remember six months later, I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, I miss this growth. I want to go back into therapy just so I can get better and grow more.\u201d That\u2019s one thing that\u2019s been really smart for us. And then, in the 30s, we all know that a lot of women are leaving men, and in the 40s, a lot of men are leaving women. The math and the science are undisputed. So, when I struggled a little bit with whether or not I wanted to be in this relationship, I asked her to change a few things. We went into therapy together, and she did. So, we just keep growing. We keep getting a better and better understanding of each other, and now, at my age, I\u2019m probably safe to be with her for another 25 years. I know how to avoid the temptations. I play with fire a little bit sometimes in that I\u2019m in those positions and having fun, but I just don\u2019t think, after 27 years of not cheating, I\u2019m going to go out and cheat. [Applause] Tim Ferriss: How do your poker skills help you away from the table? You mentioned negotiation. Are there any other areas you can think of in which poker has helped you? Phil Hellmuth: Oh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d have to think about that. Tim Ferriss: Maybe the answer is \u201ceverything.\u201d Phil Hellmuth: It could be everything. Tim Ferriss: A lot of my friends who love poker \u2013 we\u2019re not professional players by any stretch of the imagination, but I had one friend of mine who\u2019s a very well-educated guy \u2013 he has a tattoo of a semicolon on his forearm \u2013 very well-educated guy, John, who says that he learned all he needs to know about navigating the world from his learning of poker. Phil Hellmuth: I have won \u2013 so, my friend Allan Mishra, who cured tennis elbow \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I didn\u2019t know you knew Allan. Phil Hellmuth: Oh, you know Allan, too? Tim Ferriss: I know Allan. Allan is one of the foremost experts in something called platelet-rich plasma \u2013 PRP \u2013 injections. So, they take out your whole blood, they spin it in a centrifuge, and they isolate the growth factors and reinject it locally into injuries like tennis elbow. He\u2019s been in the New York Times. Fascinating guy. Phil Hellmuth: Amazing guy. He came to me in \u201902 and said, \u201cI have this PRP thing.\u201d So, I got involved with him, but I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, you\u2019re going to change the world.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s just what I needed to hear.\u201d And so, I\u2019ve invited him to my poker camps, and we hang out, and right now, we\u2019re in a suicide football league together. We have one team left. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s a suicide football league? Phil Hellmuth: It\u2019s just one where you have to pick a winner each week, but you can only pick a team once per year, so by the end, you\u2019re picking Cleveland and some other teams that haven\u2019t won many games. Anyway, Allan told me that playing poker has helped him read his patients. These high-profile patients come to him, and he says, \u201cDid you hurt your knee doing this?\u201d If they hesitate, he\u2019s like, \u201cNo true answers coming.\u201d He can \u2013 \u201cHave you been taking your medicine over the last three weeks?\u201d He can tell whether they\u2019re lying or telling the truth, and that\u2019s good for him, because then he can design a better program for them. Tim Ferriss: Fantastic doctor. Hard to get ahold of. Very popular, competent guy. Phil Hellmuth: He\u2019s the guy that invented the surgery that Kobe had on his knee, where he went to Germany. Allan invented PRP. Allan owns the U.S. patents on PRP, and yet, when Kobe goes over to Germany, no one mentions Allan Mishra\u2019s name as the inventor. It\u2019s some doctor in Germany. It\u2019s amazing what he can do. Imagine this, folks: You have your own blood. He spins out the PRP \u2013 the growth hormone. Let\u2019s just say that you have Alzheimer\u2019s. They pour the PRP in the area with Alzheimer\u2019s; he thinks that may be one area where he can help. Say you\u2019ve had a heart attack. They\u2019ve already proven the heart will come back 85 percent better with your own blood. So, imagine: We\u2019ve been searching the top of the Himalayas for amazing things when it\u2019s inside your blood \u2013 all this ability to cure. And, Allan\u2019s working on some cancer cure stuff, which is amazing \u2013 Maybe I\u2019m na\u00efve. I believe he has a decent shot \u2013 I believe he\u2019s going to cure cancer. [Applause] Tim Ferriss: Just this small-world story \u2013 it\u2019s worth pointing out \u2013 I\u2019m not originally from the Bay Area, you\u2019re not originally from the Bay Area. I got advice very early on \u2013 this is on my answering machine, actually, way back in the day \u2013 from a mentor. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re the average of the five people you associate with most.\u201d I was like, \u201cHuh.\u201d That\u2019s been one of the pieces of advice that has guided a lot of my decisions, one of which was where to move to live. In the Bay Area, you just happen to bump into people like Allan Mishra. It\u2019s amazing. When you hear the word \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: Yeah, he\u2019s a crazy guy. He just went to the Nobel prize winners and said, \u201cHey, I have a new concept. You know how we\u2019re trying to starve cancer cells? I\u2019m just going to feed them platelet-rich plasma and see how that works.\u201d So, there\u2019s been some progress. I probably sound stupid \u2013 you can keep this in, but I probably sound stupid saying I think he\u2019s going to cure cancer, but I\u2019m sticking by it. He\u2019s certainly cured a lot of other stuff. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s a brilliant guy. Phil Hellmuth: No one knows his name. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. When you hear the word \u201csuccessful,\u201d who\u2019s the first person who comes to mind and why? Phil Hellmuth: Wow. I think of some of my best friends. I think of Chamath Palihapitiya. I think of Bill Lee. People don\u2019t really \u2013 unless you\u2019re a business insider, you haven\u2019t really heard of these guys. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain? Why is that? Phil Hellmuth: If you\u2019re thinking that what Elon Musk has done is beyond success, what he\u2019s doing \u2013 he thinks we live in a matrix. He\u2019s sending people to Mars. He has Tesla; he has SpaceX. That\u2019s extraordinary. Sorry, I was thinking of Chamath Palihapitiya and Bill Lee. Tim Ferriss: Yes. Why are these two very famous investors \u2013 at this point \u2013? Phil Hellmuth: Again, nobody in the room knows their names. Tim Ferriss: What makes them successful to you? Phil Hellmuth: The thing I like about \u2013 I define success a little bit differently. So, Chamath \u2013I tease him that he got lucky. He didn\u2019t want to go to Facebook. They just kept giving him more and more stock. He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this thing is going to work.\u201d So, finally, he took the stock and went. Each point is worth, what, $2 billion now? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s done pretty well. Phil Hellmuth: But, it\u2019s what he\u2019s done \u2013he\u2019s great at poker, his family is great, he has an amazing wife \u2013 Brigette \u2013 and three young children. I see the effort that he puts into \u2013 They used to \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of people in Silicon Valley with the three nannies, the maids, all that kind of stuff. These guys have gone a little bit away from that. Chamath \u2013 he\u2019s been cooking meals for his wife and kids a little bit, which I\u2019ve never done. [Laughter] It\u2019s amazing to me \u2013 he\u2019s put family first, and yet, he still changed the world. He deployed billions \u2013 $1.2 billion now \u2013 out into the field. He\u2019s crushing it. And then, I look at my friend Bill Lee, who spends a fair amount of time in his backyard with his young kids. Deals come to him. As you know, he\u2019s really good friends with Elon Musk. I think when Elon flies over to Paris to do climate change, there\u2019s one other guy on the plane. It\u2019s Bill, because Bill\u2019s brilliant. You want Bill with you because Bill is going to help you write your climate speech. When the Gigafactory opens, you want Bill Lee next to you. And so, these guys \u2013 they\u2019re living. They\u2019re having really nice lives. Bill is one of the best angel investors in history, maybe the best angel investor in history \u2013 we don\u2019t know \u2013 but he\u2019s been involved with \u2013 but he sits in his backyard. What was it, two days ago? I went, we had lunch together, we had a drink, and just kind of chilled. I\u2019ll go to his house once a week and spend four hours in the afternoon sitting in the backyard. He has a 1-year-old, a 3-year-old, and a 6-year-old, and they\u2019re coming by, always spicing up the atmosphere. I enjoy that \u2013 I enjoy the friendship thing. I didn\u2019t get that until 2010. I was all about poker and family. And then, I just realized it\u2019s seeped into my life \u2013 the importance of strong friendships. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Phil Hellmuth: There\u2019s a concept of forgiveness that\u2019s hugely important. And so, for me personally, when I was studying Buddhism \u2013 we spent a week at Esalen, my wife Kathy and I \u2013 a week at Esalen. We weren\u2019t allowed to talk. Tim Ferriss: Esalen, for those who don\u2019t know, is an idyllic spot in Big Sur. Phil Hellmuth: Esalen is a spiritual place that was famous from the \u201860s. It has natural hot springs, and it\u2019s really fun. So, when I studied Buddhism, the concept of forgiveness was important. I had someone steal $28,000.00 from me. Now, understand: I was staking this guy. I was feeding his family. Of that $28,000.00 that he had online that he stole from me, $14,000.00 was his. All he had to do was call me and say, \u201cPhil, I need $7,000.00. You take $7,000.00, we\u2019ll leave $14,000.00 on.\u201d Instead, he chose to steal $28,000.00 from me. When I got the phone call that this had happened, I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I was in shock. This guy just stole $28,000.00 from me. I\u2019m sending money to his family. I\u2019m staking him. What\u2019s going on here? I called my friend John Bonetti. Bonetti\u2019s like, \u201cFry him!\u201d [Laughter] \u201cRelease the evidence! Crush him! Destroy him for life!\u201d We had the evidence \u2013 a neat pile of evidence. Release it on the internet and he\u2019s destroyed for life. But, what good does that do me? What good? And so, I was furious, and steaming, and whatever, and I called the guy, and he was crying on the phone. I finally just decided, \u201cHoney, you and I are going out to dinner; we\u2019re going to have the most expensive dinner and the most expensive bottle of wine I can have.\u201d \u201cMy life is amazing, and I\u2019ve spent one hour or two hours of my time steaming because someone stole from me.\u201d We went out; we had a really nice dinner. At the end of that dinner, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to completely forgive the guy.\u201d [Applause] Nothing was ever released. But, here\u2019s the beauty \u2013 here\u2019s what I didn\u2019t expect: I got paid back in full. This guy defends me to everybody on the planet. My wife said, \u201cHe\u2019s turned into a protector of yours.\u201d So now \u2013 this is a big-profile guy \u2013 he\u2019s defending me, telling everybody what a great guy I am, and I remember \u2013 The other amazing thing about this \u2013 this happened on a Monday night. I could have released it and all hell would have broken loose. The internet would have gone crazy in the poker world. Instead, I flew to Connecticut to play in a poker tournament \u2013 $10,000.00 buy-in \u2013 on Friday. You can\u2019t make this up. I saw the guy walk down the hallway to me. I shook his hand \u2013 it hurt a little bit. It hurt a little bit, but I shook his hand. I wouldn\u2019t give him a hug. I shook his hand, but I never had to worry about him again after shaking his hand. This is the freaky thing: I played in that tournament. Now, if I were at war with him \u2013 and, he couldn\u2019t have said anything negative about me, but he might have started throwing mud, trying to come up with stuff. I don\u2019t know, he could never attack me, but people would make shit up. So, rather than some mud-throwing contest, my mind is focused on the poker tournament. You can\u2019t make \u2013 I won $280,000.00. [Applause] Now, it was for third place, but $280,000.00 \u2013 exactly ten times what had been stolen from me. So, I got the $280,000.00. The guy paid me back in full, and he\u2019s been a protector of mine, all because I forgave this really bad act \u2013 bad actor act. So, I love the concept of forgiveness. This isn\u2019t the only time. I have another great forgiveness story. In fact, I\u2019m going to tell it because if anything makes this edit, I want the forgiveness stuff to make the edit. Another guy I used to play poker with in the \u201880s in Madison, Wisconsin made sure that I was banned from the big game. He didn\u2019t want me to play in the big game in Madison. He banned me. So, there was a lot of animosity towards him. Tim Ferriss: Was he afraid of losing? Why didn\u2019t he want you to play? Phil Hellmuth: Partly that. He probably thought I was acting up a little bit, but I think it was mostly that he didn\u2019t want me in the game because I was winning so much money in Madison. He banned me for three years. I moved in 1993. In 1994, I saw him with some other friends, and I invited him out to a movie. We went out to dinner and a movie, and I was as nice as I could be, and I completely forgave him. Tim Ferriss: In your head? Phil Hellmuth: In my head. And sometimes, that\u2019s an act where I\u2019ll lie down on a bed, I\u2019ll close my eyes, and I\u2019ll try to meditate, and I\u2019ll send love towards that person that I hate \u2013 waves of love, whatever that means to the individual. But, when I\u2019m doing that, I usually am on the bed a long time, because then, I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, I have to send love all the people I love, too.\u201d [Laughter] So, I\u2019m there 20 minutes, but \u2013 I don\u2019t know; I can\u2019t explain it. The very next time I see someone like that, who I\u2019ve sent love to, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve received it. Did they just notice that my demeanor towards them changed, that I\u2019m happy to see them? What happened? I don\u2019t know and I can\u2019t explain it. Tim Ferriss: So, what happened with this guy? Phil Hellmuth: So, this guy calls me three years later and said, \u201cListen: I recommended you for this deal.\u201d I made $14 million. [Applause] So, I\u2019ve got to tell you: I\u2019m into forgiveness. I forgive everybody. Now, I haven\u2019t had some of the really horrible stuff happen, like \u2013rape or stuff like that. I wouldn\u2019t know how to counsel someone if some really traumatic stuff happened. But, I know for me, forgiving people stealing from me and all this other stuff has led to amazing results, and I have no hatred in my heart. I get to walk around happy every day. Again, I think it\u2019s really huge \u2013 I\u2019ll say it again: When you\u2019re walking down any hallway and anybody on the planet walks toward you, you don\u2019t have to turn left or right. [Applause] Tim Ferriss: I think it\u2019s also \u2013 I remember thinking to myself at one point that if you\u2019re offended easily \u2013 because I am offended easily; I have some anger issues sometimes \u2013 you\u2019re a bad resource allocator. It\u2019s a bad use of this finite resource, which is your energy, calories, and hours on this planet when you\u2019re awake. So, for me, it\u2019s a 2 for 1 if you forgive people. You get the altruism, but you also get the practicality, and then you get these unforeseen ripple effects later. Phil Hellmuth: I wasn\u2019t expecting the ripple effects, but it happened, and it was wonderful. I\u2019m like, \u201cWow, this is something I\u2019m going to do the rest of my life.\u201d Yeah, I\u2019ve had guys write 80 negative blogs about me, about the way I play poker. It never crossed the line to personal \u2013 maybe a little bit in there \u2013 and I forgave those guys. I knew this guy who attacked me all the time that actually kind of loved me, so I forgave him, and we moved on, and we\u2019re friends. I have never written anything negative about him ever, but it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t feel the need to. Tim Ferriss: So, I want to take a hard left turn and talk about \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: We\u2019re turning away from forgiveness? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to rampage \u2013 from forgiveness to rampage. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not going to end on a sour \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: Somebody knew what that \u201crampage\u201d was about. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re not going to end on a sour note. So, you told a story last night \u2013 well, I was having some Malbec; let\u2019s be honest \u2013 and you told the \u201cI\u2019m going on the rampage\u201d story. Was this in Europe, or was it somewhere else? Phil Hellmuth: We had a $300,000.00 buy-in tournament in May, and I decided \u2013 There was a $300,000.00, a $100,000.00, and another $100,000.00. I thought, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve been bad at raising money to play poker. I\u2019ve had one guy stake me; I\u2019ve made him $1.5 million. It\u2019s been great. Let me try this other way.\u201d And so, I reached out to my friends, but I wasn\u2019t sure they would respond. So, I reached out, but I thought, \u201cI only want to reach out once. So, in this email, I\u2019m going to say the first thing: It\u2019s a high-risk investment. You\u2019re putting up $540,000.00 for me to play six tournaments. That\u2019s high-risk. So, be aware that you\u2019re probably going to lose your money.\u201d That\u2019s how I led the email. And then, I listed the events, when they would be on television \u2013 because it\u2019s kind of fun, when you\u2019re staking someone, to watch them live on television. They\u2019re playing your money. If they\u2019re live on television, you\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s my horse, man!\u201d That\u2019s better than having somebody in the Kentucky Derby. The Derby only last 60 seconds. They got to watch me play \u2013 Tim Ferriss: You get to be nervous for hours. Phil Hellmuth: They got to watch me \u2013 yes! They got to watch me play 20 hours of live television in this event, or more than that, so it\u2019s kind of cool. So, I sent it out, and I also put wiring instructions. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d $540,000.00. I\u2019ll take a 10 percent freeroll, and I\u2019ll put in the first $54,000.00. That way, I\u2019m playing for 20 percent. Let\u2019s see what happens. Well, within 20 hours, I sold up, and then, people were mad at me because I didn\u2019t get him in. So now, I\u2019m playing this $300,000.00 buy-in tournament, and it\u2019s live on Fox Sports Net. We\u2019re on Day 2 or whatever \u2013 I think it sold out at 48 players. We\u2019re on Day 2, it\u2019s late, and maybe even Day 3, and I\u2019m feeling boxed in. Tim Ferriss: What does that mean? Phil Hellmuth: I have a young, great player on my right \u2013 Dan Smith \u2013 another great player \u2013 Fedor Holz \u2013 on my left, who\u2019s been crushing it in 2016, just crushing it, and there was somebody else there. I just felt like they were on to me. They were playing me too well. I said, \u201cScrew this. I might bust myself, but I\u2019m going to try something else. This is it: They\u2019re too attuned to me.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Well, they also have years of tape on you. Phil Hellmuth: Correct. So, I said, \u201cI\u2019m on a rampage. Raise it.\u201d I\u2019m throwing the chips in, and I\u2019m saying \u201cI\u2019m on a rampage\u201d once every 15 seconds. \u201cI\u2019m on a rampage.\u201d I raised ten pots in a row, and they\u2019re like \u2013 from being this calm patient Phil to raising all of a sudden \u2013I just saw the looks on their faces. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d \u201cRaise it, raise it!\u201d Well, the hold cards are flashing to the world \u2013 nine-deuce, off-suit. Jack-four, off-suit. Seven-deuce, off-suit. Nothing \u2013 I\u2019m not even looking at my hands. I didn\u2019t even look at a hand during my rampage. \u201cRaise it, raise it! I\u2019m on a rampage! I\u2019m on a rampage!\u201d I\u2019m winning every pot, accumulating all these chips, and I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right, I messed up their flow.\u201d If they do call, I\u2019m betting the flop, betting the turn, firing \u2013 just throwing chips in there. I\u2019m saying, \u201cI\u2019m on a rampage, I\u2019m on a rampage.\u201d It was great television. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sure! Phil Hellmuth: Two things happened: 1). I\u2019m finally in the big blind \u2013 Tim Ferriss: All the backers are like, \u201cMy horse is on a rampage!\u201d Phil Hellmuth: Oh, yeah. I got those emails the next day, trust me. So now, I\u2019m in the big blind; I hadn\u2019t looked at my hold cards. There\u2019s a guy in the small blind. I said, \u201cI\u2019m on a rampage.\u201d Everybody else had folded \u2013 they don\u2019t dare raise my blind. He\u2019s like, \u201cAll in.\u201d He puts $2 million in. I looked down at queens. I called $700,000.00 \u2013 he has a nine and a ten. I win that point \u2013 I\u2019m at $1.4 million, and I\u2019m on a rampage. I\u2019m going on and on about it. Finally, I slowed down. Now, the next day \u2013 so, I did this; no one on the planet understands why I did this. This is one reason why they say I\u2019m a bad poker player. What I\u2019m trying to do is just lose my mind, be crazy, and let them know, \u201cYou\u2019re not bluffing me for this next 20 hands. You are not going to bluff me. You might beat me, but if you re-raise me, I\u2019m calling all your re-raises, too.\u201d I\u2019m telling them, \u201cIf you re-raise me, I\u2019m calling, so let\u2019s just get it on. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d It\u2019s all threat and bluster, and I probably would have called them if they re-raised me because that\u2019s just what I was going to do. But, it really changed the dynamics of the game. Now, of course, the next day, I had five different investors emailing me. \u201cPhil, don\u2019t lose it like that again. Phil, what were you thinking? Phil, what are you doing? Why are you playing nine-deuce off-suit? Why are you playing jack-three off-suit?\u201d All these commentaries, and I\u2019m just like, \u201cDoesn\u2019t anybody see the brilliance of what I did?\u201d [Laughter] No! They see the insanity of what I just did. Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re one and the same, right? \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the face\u201d \u2013 Cus D\u2019Amato, trainer of Mike Tyson. \u201cYou have a pretty theory. Now, let me go on a rampage.\u201d So, we\u2019re going to wrap it up with \u2013 Phil Hellmuth: By the way, some of the highest ratings ever in poker history. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I\u2019m sure. Phil Hellmuth: To watch me go crazy like that? Those clips have been watched a ton. Tim Ferriss: Ladies and gentlemen: Phil Hellmuth. [Applause] Phil Hellmuth: That was great. I really enjoyed that.

successful for me", "$10,000.00 doesn\u2019t last too long in the games i play in, but i can\u2019t always tell, when i\u2019ve lost $10,000.00, whether i\u2019m \u2013 the reason i implemented it

would you have reacted had you not won", "i think it would have been devastating, but i would have still had $350,000.00 or $400,000.00", "you have to understand: at that point, i was already \u2013 there were four majors per year, and then there were nine world series", "so, that year, there were 11 world series of poker championships, and then there three that i really wanted to win which i considered majors", "one of them was the bicycle club main event, and i won that one in august 1988", "i\u2019d already won one of the majors and was all over the poker press, so to win that was the greatest moment \u2013 maybe the greatest moment in my poker career \u2013 just to win that", "it\u2019s nice to back it up 13 more times", "so, speaking of backing it up, at what point before 1989

appreciate \u2013 the thinking hard", "the question is: when did johnny show you his hand", "this is what i\u2019ve read; maybe this is also just myth", "you saw something, or at least you told him you saw something", "the interesting thing about this \u2013 this is more for poker people", "i\u2019ll try to make it so everybody can understand it", "the blinds were $5,000.00 and $10,000.00 when we were heads-up", "the first thing i had whispered to johnny chan \u2013 we\u2019d played 32 minutes \u2013 i\u2019d whispered at the beginning, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to play perfect and get lucky to beat me.\u201d now, if the cameras had been working in those days, that\u2019s one that would have been played a lot, and people would have said, \u201cboy, that kid\u2019s cocky.\u201d

in terms of how much money you\u2019re raising, okay", "that\u2019s three and a half times the big blind", "that\u2019s how they look at it these days", "a 3.5 is pretty big", "but then, chan called

changed his style", "my mind was completely encompassed in how i was going to win this", "exactly four hands later, i looked at two black nines, and it was like the script was already written",

then he did it", "i waited; i didn\u2019t want to give anything away", "i didn\u2019t want to show any excitement", "i didn\u2019t want to do anything that would change him from doing what he was going to do", "he re-raised $130,000.00", "the minute those chips hit the pot, i said, \u201ci\u2019m all in.\u201d he started the hand with $600,000.00", "boom", "i\u2019m raising all your chips right back on you", "it was two black nines \u2013 a pretty strong hand", "he started studying and thinking, and i thought to myself if he had ace-king, ace-queen, ace-jack, or ace-ten, he would have put money in already", "those hands are very close \u2013 maybe a 12 to 10, 13 to 10 favorite", "i don\u2019t want to play a pot where i\u2019m only 12 to 10 or 13 to 10", "i don\u2019t want to leave it to chance", "i also thought that he would call with any pair above tens instantly", "so, at that point, i\u2019m thinking, \u201cwhat does he have", "do i want him to call or not?\u201d i had been around poker long enough where i didn\u2019t want to influence the action by acting strong or acting weak", "i said, \u201cjust let things play out and see where it lands.\u201d but, if he had king-queen, i didn\u2019t want him to call", "i\u2019m only a small favorite", "when he had the ace-seven of spades, i was kind of surprised \u2013 also, he would have called right away with eights or sevens, which is a great position for me", "when he had ace-seven of spades, i was kind of surprised", "it was a little weaker, and i think he decided, \u201cthis kid is tough.\u201d he and i had faced off in the 1988 world series", "he\u2019d seen me", "we\u2019d faced off in august at the tournament; i won when i won the major at the bicycle club that i just mentioned", "and so, he knew that i was there", "he\u2019d even come out in esquire magazine in january and said, \u201cthis kid is going to win the main event as soon as he learns to tuck it in a little bit.\u201d that was more fuel for my fire, reading myself in esquire magazine", "that was a big thing, man", "back then, nobody talked about poker", "so, when called with ace-seven of spades, i was kind of surprised, but again, i thought, \u201call right, he\u2019s going to find a way to outdraw me.\u201d it\u2019s not that i felt the negativity", "it\u2019s more like you have to be prepared for him to hit it", "he\u2019s been lucky, you\u2019ve watched him get lucky, so when that six of spades hit, i was \u2013heaven", "i was going to tell you about the question that antonio asked me that you asked me about last night", "let\u2019s jump into it", "okay", "let\u2019s see", "[laughter] another subject switch for phil \u2013 get used to it", "antonio is a mutual friend, very savvy investor and entrepreneur in his own

without your wife?\u201d and, i wanted to answer selfishly, \u201cwell, i might have more because i would have played more tournaments,\u201d but i knew that wasn\u2019t true", "i was like,

that dinner, i said, \u201ci\u2019m going to completely forgive the guy.\u201d [applause] nothing was ever released", "but, here\u2019s the beauty \u2013 here\u2019s what i didn\u2019t expect: i got paid back in full", "this guy defends me to everybody on the planet", "my wife said, \u201che\u2019s turned into a protector of yours.\u201d so now \u2013 this is a big-profile guy \u2013 he\u2019s defending me, telling everybody what a great guy i am, and i remember \u2013 the other amazing thing about this \u2013 this happened on a monday night", "i could have released it and all hell would have broken loose", "the internet would have gone crazy in the poker world", "instead, i flew to connecticut to play in a poker tournament \u2013 $10,000.00 buy-in \u2013 on friday", "you can\u2019t make this up", "i saw the guy walk down the hallway to me", "i shook his hand \u2013 it hurt a little bit", "it hurt a little bit, but i shook his hand", "i wouldn\u2019t give him a hug", "i shook his hand, but i never had to worry about him again after shaking his hand", "this is the freaky thing: i played in that tournament", "now, if i were at war with him \u2013 and, he couldn\u2019t have said anything negative about me, but he might have started throwing mud, trying to come up with stuff", "i don\u2019t know, he could never attack me, but people would make shit up", "so, rather than some mud-throwing contest, my mind is focused on the poker tournament", "you can\u2019t make \u2013 i won $280,000.00", "[applause] now, it was for third place, but $280,000.00 \u2013 exactly ten times what had been stolen from me", "so, i got the $280,000.00", "the guy paid me back in full, and he\u2019s been a protector of mine, all because i forgave this really bad act \u2013 bad actor act", "so, i love the concept of forgiveness", "this isn\u2019t the only time", "i have another great forgiveness story", "in fact, i\u2019m going to tell it because if anything makes this edit, i want the forgiveness stuff to make the edit", "another guy i used to play poker with in the \u201880s in madison, wisconsin made sure that i was banned from the big game", "he didn\u2019t want me to play in the big game in madison", "he banned me", "so, there was a lot of animosity towards him", "was he afraid of losing", "why didn\u2019t he want you to play", "partly that", "he probably thought i was acting up a little bit, but i think it was mostly that he didn\u2019t want me in the game because i was winning so much money in madison", "he banned me for three years", "i moved in 1993", "in 1994, i saw him with some other friends, and i invited him out to a movie", "we went out to dinner and a movie, and i was as nice as i could be, and i completely forgave him", "in your head", "in my head", "and sometimes, that\u2019s an act where i\u2019ll lie down on a bed, i\u2019ll close my eyes, and i\u2019ll try to meditate, and i\u2019ll send love towards that person that i hate \u2013 waves of love, whatever that means to the individual", "but, when i\u2019m doing that, i usually am on the bed a long time, because then, i\u2019m like, \u201cwell, i have to send love all the people i love, too.\u201d [laughter] so, i\u2019m there 20 minutes, but \u2013 i don\u2019t know; i can\u2019t explain it", "the very next time i see someone like that, who i\u2019ve sent love to, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve received it", "did they just notice that my demeanor towards them changed, that i\u2019m happy to see them", "what happened", "i don\u2019t know and i can\u2019t explain it", "so, what happened with this guy", "so, this guy calls me three years later and said, \u201clisten: i recommended you for this deal.\u201d i made $14 million", "[applause] so, i\u2019ve got to tell you: i\u2019m into forgiveness", "i forgive everybody", "now, i haven\u2019t had some of the really horrible stuff happen, like \u2013rape or stuff like that", "i wouldn\u2019t know how to counsel someone if some really traumatic stuff happened", "but, i know for me, forgiving people stealing from me and all this other stuff has led to amazing results, and i have no hatred in my heart", "i get to walk around happy every day", "again, i think it\u2019s really huge \u2013 i\u2019ll say it again: when you\u2019re walking down any hallway and anybody on the planet walks toward you, you don\u2019t have to turn left or right", "[applause] i think it\u2019s also \u2013 i remember thinking to myself at one point that if you\u2019re offended easily \u2013 because i am offended easily; i have some anger issues sometimes \u2013 you\u2019re a bad resource allocator", "it\u2019s a bad use of this finite resource, which is your energy, calories, and hours on this planet when you\u2019re awake", "so, for me, it\u2019s a 2 for 1 if you forgive people", "you get the altruism, but you also get the practicality, and then you get these unforeseen ripple effects later", "i wasn\u2019t expecting the ripple effects, but it happened, and it was wonderful", "i\u2019m like, \u201cwow, this is something i\u2019m going to do the rest of my life.\u201d yeah, i\u2019ve had guys write 80 negative blogs about me, about the way i play poker", "it never crossed the line to personal \u2013 maybe a little bit in there \u2013 and i forgave those guys", "i knew this guy who attacked me all the time that actually kind of loved me, so i forgave him, and we moved on, and we\u2019re friends", "i have never written anything negative about him ever, but it\u2019s okay", "i don\u2019t feel the need to", "so, i want to take a hard left turn and talk about \u2013 we\u2019re turning away from forgiveness", "i\u2019m going to rampage \u2013 from forgiveness to rampage", "don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not going to end on a sour \u2013 somebody knew what that \u201crampage\u201d was about", "we\u2019re not going to end on a sour note", "so, you told a story last night \u2013 well, i was having some malbec; let\u2019s be honest \u2013 and you told the \u201ci\u2019m going on the rampage\u201d story", "was this in europe, or was it somewhere else", "we had a $300,000.00 buy-in tournament in may, and i decided \u2013 there was a $300,000.00, a $100,000.00, and another $100,000.00", "i thought, \u201cyou know what", "i\u2019ve been bad at raising money to play poker", "i\u2019ve had one guy stake me; i\u2019ve made him $1.5 million", "it\u2019s been great", "let me try this other way.\u201d and so, i reached out to my friends, but i wasn\u2019t sure they would respond", "so, i reached out, but i thought, \u201ci only want to reach out once", "so, in this email, i\u2019m going to say the first thing: it\u2019s a high-risk investment", "you\u2019re putting up $540,000.00 for me to play six tournaments", "that\u2019s high-risk", "so, be aware that you\u2019re probably going to lose your money.\u201d that\u2019s how i led the email", "and then, i listed the events, when they would be on television \u2013 because it\u2019s kind of fun, when you\u2019re staking someone, to watch them live on television", "they\u2019re playing your money", "if they\u2019re live on television, you\u2019re like, \u201cthat\u2019s my horse, man!\u201d that\u2019s better than having somebody in the kentucky derby", "the derby only last 60 seconds", "they got to watch me play \u2013 you get to be nervous for hours", "they got to watch me \u2013 yes", "they got to watch me play 20 hours of live television in this event, or more than that, so it\u2019s kind of cool", "so, i sent it out, and i also put wiring instructions", "i said, \u201clet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d $540,000.00", "i\u2019ll take a 10 percent freeroll, and i\u2019ll put in the first $54,000.00", "that way, i\u2019m playing for 20 percent", "let\u2019s see what happens", "well, within 20 hours, i sold up, and then, people were mad at me because i didn\u2019t get him in", "so now, i\u2019m playing this $300,000.00 buy-in tournament, and it\u2019s live on fox sports net", "we\u2019re on day 2 or whatever \u2013 i think it sold out at 48 players", "we\u2019re on day 2, it\u2019s late, and maybe even day 3, and i\u2019m feeling boxed in", "what does that mean", "i have a young, great player on my right \u2013 dan smith \u2013 another great player \u2013 fedor holz \u2013 on my left, who\u2019s been crushing it in 2016, just crushing it, and there was somebody else there", "i just felt like they were on to me", "they were playing me too well", "i said, \u201cscrew this", "i might bust myself, but i\u2019m going to try something else", "this is it: they\u2019re too attuned to me.\u201d well, they also have years of tape on you", "correct", "so, i said, \u201ci\u2019m on a rampage", "raise it.\u201d i\u2019m throwing the chips in, and i\u2019m saying \u201ci\u2019m on a rampage\u201d once every 15 seconds", "\u201ci\u2019m on a rampage.\u201d i raised ten pots in a row, and they\u2019re like

on a rampage.\u201d it was great television", "i\u2019m sure", "two things happened: 1)", "i\u2019m finally in the big blind \u2013 all the backers are like, \u201cmy horse is on a rampage!\u201d oh, yeah", "i got those emails the next day, trust me", "so now, i\u2019m in the big blind; i hadn\u2019t looked at my hold cards", "there\u2019s a guy in the small blind", "i said, \u201ci\u2019m on a

so, i did this; no one on the planet understands why i did this", "this is one reason why they say i\u2019m a bad poker player", "what i\u2019m trying to do is just lose my mind, be crazy, and let them know, \u201cyou\u2019re not bluffing me for this next 20 hands", "you are not going to bluff me", "you might beat me, but if you re-raise me, i\u2019m calling all your re-raises, too.\u201d
