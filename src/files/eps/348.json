This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job each and every episode, this one included, to interview and dissect world-class performers of all different types \u2013 business, sports, chess, entertainment, music, sometimes folks who span many multiple disciplines and this is one of those cases, in my mind at least. We have Dave Elitch sitting across from me. Dave, how are you? Dave Elitch: I\u2019m great, man. Happy to be here. Tim Ferriss: On Instagram and Twitter and elsewhere, @daveelitch, E-L-I-T-C-H. Daveelitch.com. Instagram would probably be the first choice for checking him out. I\u2019ll read the bio, and then I have all sorts of questions about the bio. But I think before I get into that, I think it\u2019s helpful to, perhaps as context for some folks, mention what I said to my girlfriend last night, who asked me, fairly, \u201cWho is Dave? Why is he in the house?\u201d Not in an accusatory way. More out of curiosity.  You were helping to set up my first-ever drum kit after many, many misfires, which we won\u2019t get into right now. There are a lot of people very, very high on drugs who will volunteer to help you assemble kits. It turns out they don\u2019t follow the directions very well. I wanted her to hear you play. Just to tool around after we had consumed many pounds of pork and biscuits and all sorts of other Texan health food. She had asked me at some point the day before, mostly as a hypothetical question, but also she was very curious, \u201cI wonder who Annie goes to for relationship advice?\u201d Annie, in this case, is a very well-known relationship coach/therapist. Who does the relationship coach go to for relationship advice?  I use that as a bridge to say well, many of the musicians you think of, many of the best drummers you might see on stage go to Dave as sort of the drumming whisperer/mechanic fixer, among many other things. So let\u2019s jump into the bio. But for those people who are listening and who are thinking to themselves, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know anything about drumming and I really don\u2019t know anything about music; this is an audio-only format; I\u2019m not going to be able to watch Dave smashing on his kit,\u201d we are going to jump across all sorts of different topics. So fear not.  Let\u2019s get into the basic bio. Dave Elitch first garnered attention with his band, Daughters of Mara\u2019s debut album I Am Destroyer in 2007. Very appropriate debut album name for a lot of reasons. But his time touring with the progressive rock band The Mars Volta in 2009-2010 is what really put him on the map and certainly put you on my map, which we can get into. He has since worked with Miley Cyrus, Justin Timberlake, M83, The 1975, Juliette Lewis, Big Black Delta, and many, many others. He conducts master class lectures worldwide, and, in fact, you are going to be conducting a master class tomorrow here in Austin, Texas, which is exciting.  He\u2019s a regular in the L.A. session scene. I want to come back to a bunch of vocab here that we can dissect, including performing on film scores for many major motion pictures \u2013 and I have questions about that. As an educator for the last 20 years, which for people who have listened to this podcast for a while is part of what makes you so interesting to me. It\u2019s not just the ability to perform, but the ability to transmit and to break down and to convey and to demystify.  Back to the sentence. As an educator for the last 20 years, Dave has developed a reputation as the technique body mechanic specialist who has helped many of the world\u2019s top players and educators overcome physical and mental plateaus at his private studio in Los Angeles. Your brand-new online course, Getting Out of Your Own Way, which is perhaps the best title of any course I\u2019ve ever encountered is available at daveelitch.com. I have checked it out. It is fucking awesome. Dave Elitch: Thank you. Tim Ferriss: I have spent a lot of time thinking about teaching. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about learning, and I\u2019m by no means a musician but have also digested a fair amount of material related to drumming and cannot recommend it highly enough. Dave Elitch: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: I thought we could start with the t-shirt that you\u2019re wearing right now. It\u2019s a t-shirt that I liked so much at one point when we hung out in L.A. and smashed on some drums and then ate a bunch of Himalayan yak if I remember correctly, I asked you where I could get one of these shirts. So could you describe for people what you\u2019re wearing at the moment and why?  Dave Elitch: Absolutely. I\u2019m wearing one of the t-shirts that I make and are available on my website that say \u201cslow down\u201d on the front and \u201cdo it again\u201d on the back. It came from me having to say that over and over and over again to people as I was teaching them. So I just got tired of yelling at people and saying the same shit over and over again. So I point at my shirt now, and go, come on, slow it down. Because so many people, it\u2019s not about what you\u2019re trying to learn as much as it is about how you approach learning it, which obviously is a universal concept.  So many people try to rush through things so quickly, especially when you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s so physically and mentally demanding as drumming. If you don\u2019t approach it slowly, your brain has no idea what your body is doing. So all these people try to rush through something, and they physiologically have no idea what\u2019s going on. \u201cDo it again\u201d because of the sheer amount of repetition you have to do to plug in that muscle memory. It\u2019s fun. I made it just as a joke kind of, you know?  And then people would come up to me on the street and be like, \u201cOh, I love that shirt,\u201d because people get whatever sort of meaning they want. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s the Rorschach inkblot test.  Dave Elitch: Absolutely. People love it, and they get whatever they want out of it. It could mean all sorts of different things.  Tim Ferriss: This also I think highlights for me a difference between, a critical difference in learning anything, or several critical differences. One is developing a skill versus demonstrating the skill. You could apply that to say, strength. It\u2019s development versus display; competing in powerlifting versus training for powerlifting. In this case, I think maybe a good contrast that comes to mind would be last night, sitting down at this electronic drum kit, my first kit of that type that I\u2019ve ever used, and playing with the basic posture and body mechanics. So you would ask me to relinquish control of my arm and provide deadweight and to do the same with my leg, to try to ensure that, for instance, when using the \u2013 I never know if I should call it a kick or bass or something else.  Dave Elitch: Same thing. Tim Ferriss: Kick or bass drum or pedal, rather, that I would be using my hip as opposed to getting wicket-whack with my ankle or other articulation. In aiming to do that, ensuring that I\u2019m not leaning back like I\u2019m in an easy rider because that creates all sorts of instability. It was incredible to me, but not surprising given my time with you, that within about 120 seconds, you took one of my greatest sources of discomfort sitting at any kit, which was feeling like I had to be balanced on my left ass cheek to make the bass pedal work properly, and you removed that, so now I could have a little bit of anterior pelvic tilt. And for people wondering what that means, imagine your hips are a glass of wine. If you pour wine out the front, that\u2019s anterior pelvic tilt. Posterior pelvic tilt would be pouring wine out the back. And so having a little bit of tilt forward so that I can fit my sit bones on the stool, which you also helped me to do by taking a weight plate \u2013 this was in the garage, and the gym is also there \u2013 and putting it on top of it. So you diagnosed that very quickly. And then we practiced a very slow, basic, sort of AC/DC rock beat. Dave Elitch: Money beat.  Tim Ferriss: In doing that, we were able to focus on some fundamental grips and so on in a very slow fashion. But the video that introduced you to me has a number, it turns out, of stories associated with it that I hadn\u2019t heard. It seems like a lot of people have come to find you through this video. So I\u2019d love to tell people about it. I think it came about because I was on Twitter at God knows what unholy hour and was thinking about drumming. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by drumming. So I asked something along the lines of \u201cWho is a beast drummer who is also a good drummer?\u201d and somebody threw a link up to this video. What is the video?  Dave Elitch: The video is me playing with The Mars Volta at a Big Day Out Festival in Sydney, Australia in 2010, early 2010. I would videotape all of the shows that we played. I\u2019d set up a little camera behind me. Because when you\u2019re in the heat of battle, as you could say, you have no idea how it\u2019s actually coming across. If I backtrack a little bit, with this situation and a lot of situations that I get called for, I\u2019ve sort of developed this reputation as a bit of a mercenary in that like when someone breaks their arm or someone gets fired, or someone needs someone to do a tour like last minute, with no rehearsal, little rehearsal, whatever, they call me and I have to learn everything last minute. It\u2019s funny. I\u2019ve been \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The Cleaner.  Dave Elitch: Yeah, exactly. So with The Mars Volta, with Miley Cyrus, with 1975, with M83, you walk into a room. You go, \u201cNice to meet you guys.\u201d You might run through the set once, and then you\u2019re playing in front of 15,000-30,000 people. It\u2019s a unique situation to be in. The amount of pressure is unbelievable. Because as a drummer, if you drop the ball, the whole show collapses in on top of you. It\u2019s not like the guitar, where you can go, whoops, flubbed that, and then you can just kind of keep playing.  Tim Ferriss: Do it twice, and you\u2019re playing jazz.  Dave Elitch: Yes, exactly. Drumming, if you drop the ball, the whole show caves in on you. So The Mars Volta was the first big situation that I was in like that. I got that gig when I was 25. They called hundreds of people to do it. People were sending in video auditions and all kinds of stuff. When they asked me to do it, I said, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d In your head, it\u2019s one of those \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had this experience before \u2013 they\u2019re like, \u201cGreat, this sounds great.\u201d In my head, I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no,\u201d and then I was just like, \u201cYes.\u201d Yes just comes out of your mouth. I feel like every important life decision I\u2019ve ever made, that happens, and it\u2019s super important just to do it.  Tim Ferriss: Grow wings on the way down. Dave Elitch: Yes, exactly. So I flew to Europe, met the band, we ran through the two and a half hour set twice, and then went on tour. This is for people who aren\u2019t familiar with the band, it\u2019s extremely complex music. Lots of \u2013 Omar the guitar player, lots of hand signals and eyebrows, cues.  Tim Ferriss: I didn\u2019t realize that. So he\u2019s like a major league baseball catcher.  Dave Elitch: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There\u2019s a long drum solo every night. You have to be on point, really. So I would set up a camera behind me every night to be like, \u201cI need to know what this actually sounds like.\u201d Because in the heat of the moment, you could think you\u2019re killing it, and then you watch a video, and you\u2019re like, \u201cUgh, whoops.\u201d Or the opposite is also true always. I could be like, \u201cI feel like that didn\u2019t sound good at all,\u201d and then I watch the video, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, that was actually okay.\u201d That level of cognitive disconnect in that scenario is huge.  I would go back to my hotel room after the show, and watch the video and take mental notes about things that worked and things that didn\u2019t work. For me, it\u2019s always been very important to put on a visual show. There\u2019s nothing worse than going to see a show and just watching someone that looks like they\u2019re doing their taxes.  Tim Ferriss: Why do you think this particular video \u2013 and we\u2019ll put it in the show notes for people who want to see it, you can go to tim.blog/podcast, and it\u2019ll be right in the show notes so you can find the link. But if people wanted to Google this, is there anything, in particular, they should search for? Dave Elitch: You could type in \u201cDave Elitch drum cam\u201d or just \u201cDave Elitch,\u201d and it\u2019s going to pop up at the top somewhere.  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s one of the very first results. Why do you think this video \u2013 and this is related to where you were going, I think \u2013 why do you think this video caught on in the way that it did? Dave Elitch: Because I\u2019m going apeshit. Tim Ferriss: Fucking berserk.  Dave Elitch: I was standing up, kicking stuff over. Like, just going nuts. I think it\u2019s really important to put on a show, so people are like, \u201cHoly shit. What is going on? This is insane.\u201d So yeah, I\u2019m standing up and hitting super hard. It\u2019s visually entertaining. But the most important part of that is the playing has to be happening. If you go nuts, and then you screw something up, there\u2019s a point. So the playing has to be on point, and then I\u2019m going to stand up and kick something over, you know?  Tim Ferriss: Before you had your first, whether it\u2019s your first performance with The Mars Volta, so you\u2019ve gone through the set twice. You\u2019re in Europe. Or wherever you are in the world. What is your self-talk or your prep before going out on stage to play with this band? Dave Elitch: You\u2019ll be into this because there\u2019s a lot of note-taking.  Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m already into it. Dave Elitch: This is something that I do with a lot of people that I work with. Just showing them how to chart out a song properly because so many people write out way too much nonsense and then it\u2019s way too much to navigate. Learning music at the last minute and having to play it, that does happen quite a bit, whether it\u2019s like a coffee house or a huge show or whatever. So most people will write out everything, and then they go to look at it, and they have no idea. They can\u2019t read their handwriting. Meaning what I do with people is it\u2019s just the roadmap. You\u2019re not writing out notation. It\u2019s just like intro \u2013 eight bars; verse \u2013 16 bars; chorus \u2013 16. It\u2019s just that.  That\u2019s it. I might say where my right hand is. Right cymbal, crash, high hat. But it\u2019s very minimalistic. So I made those charts for all the songs. I would go through \u2013 it\u2019s all about how you approach this stuff, right? A lot of people would go, \u201cI\u2019m going to play through this setlist,\u201d just bang, bang, bang, down the line. But you\u2019re constantly distracted. You\u2019re constantly switching. The target\u2019s moving. So you can\u2019t get deep. Tim Ferriss: Why is the target moving? Dave Elitch: Because you\u2019re switching songs all the time. What I would do is I would take the first song in the setlist, and I would have my notes and the music, and I would play through it as many times as it took for me to be like, \u201cI know this really well.\u201d But the same thing on repeat. Most people would be like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to go through the set and then it\u2019s like \u2013\u201d Tim Ferriss: By the songs changing, you mean that show to show? Dave Elitch: No, I mean within the setlist itself. So like someone would play the first song and then the second song and then the third song all in a row. Then they can\u2019t remember anything because they\u2019re working on all the songs at the same time.  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s linear. Dave Elitch: Yes, exactly. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s also \u2013 just because we\u2019ve both had a fair amount of caffeine, so I feel like we can make use of that caffeine now \u2013 this is also a reason why certain mnemonic devices work better than others. For instance, if you use what sometimes is referred to as a memory palace, this has been used for thousands of years. Cicero used it for memorizing speeches, among other things, where you could take \u2013 this is also how a lot of memory competitors memorize shuffled decks of cards, is they will memorize pairs of cards as interacting images and place them along a familiar route. So walking from their front door to the grocery store or something like that.  But one of the challenges with that is if you want to get to the 12th item and recall that 12th item, you have to run through the list. Similarly, if you\u2019re only memorizing or getting familiar with a playlist or a set from one to 12 or whatever the number is, and then all of a sudden I\u2019m just like imagining the lead singer\u2019s like, \u201cFuck it. I feel we should just go to five.\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m not ready for five.\u201d  Dave Elitch: Totally. That\u2019s a very real thing. And that\u2019s a real thing also when people are doing method book work like out of a drum book, let\u2019s say. I might have them learn the entire page; this happens all the time. I\u2019m like, \u201cCool. Let me hear you start from the end.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cUh\u2026\u201d So that is a very important point, and that comes later in the process, at the end of the process. So I will go through one song over and over and over again until I know it really well; this is huge; practicing not in regards to time, but in regards to goals.  So the number of people who go to music school and they go, \u201cYeah, I practice eight hours a day.\u201d It\u2019s not about how much time. It\u2019s about what you\u2019re getting done. And having specific goals. And writing that down and go, \u201cI need to get this from here to here. Once I get that done, I\u2019m done. Check. Moving on.\u201d A lot of people go, \u201cI need to work on this thing for an hour.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s not a tangible goal. An hour for you and an hour for me are completely different. One person could get it in 20 minutes. Another person could take two hours. It\u2019s unbelievable how everyone structures things in terms of time.  Tim Ferriss: How do you know when you have a song?  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know if I can put that into words. Tim Ferriss: What does it feel like? Dave Elitch: It feels like \u2013 you\u2019ve given a lot of talks. You rehearse it enough, and you\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t need these notes.\u201d You know it in your core. It\u2019s like when you memorize your times tables or whatever. It\u2019s that same type of thing. You don\u2019t have to gear up to get it going.  Tim Ferriss: Someone could slap you in the face to wake you up and be like, \u201cDo this,\u201d and it would come out. Dave Elitch: It\u2019s in your bones. I prepare in that regard like an insane amount. It\u2019s like a ridiculous amount. So I\u2019ll play the song; I don\u2019t know, like five or 10 times with my notes. And then I start, \u201cOkay, I think I got it now.\u201d Then I\u2019ll put my notes away and just play. No, sorry. Then I\u2019ll play with just the notes, no music. Then I\u2019ll play \u2013 Tim Ferriss: As you were saying. So you\u2019re accompanying the music first with your notes.  Dave Elitch: Yes. And then when I get comfortable the next step \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Turn off the music. Dave Elitch: \u2013 and just play with the notes. And then the next step is music, no notes. And then the final step is just a click track, nothing else. So just a click track.  Tim Ferriss: Click track metronome. Dave Elitch: Yeah. So I hear nothing, and I have to know it so well that I can get through the whole song in my head, hearing everything. That\u2019s an insane amount of work. But the deal is when you get on stage, and there are 30,000 people screaming, and like with Miley, people throwing bras and underwear at me.  Tim Ferriss: Better than batteries and tomatoes, I guess. Or beer bottles.  Dave Elitch: Like at that moment, you have to know everything so well that that\u2019s not going to faze you. It takes a long time. I\u2019m in there for 10 or 12 hours at the beginning. But that type of preparation is huge. What\u2019s funny is when I went to Amsterdam to rehearse the set with them, I set up an extra floor tom on my left side, which you normally wouldn\u2019t do that; they\u2019re on your right side. Were you going to say something? Tim Ferriss: No, no, no. I was going to say maybe you could explain what a floor tom is for people who don\u2019t know. Dave Elitch: Yeah. So Tom\u2019s, yeah, interesting explaining this. Man, how would you explain this to a layman? Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s tough. I\u2019m going to do a poor job. Dave Elitch: Yeah, great. Tim Ferriss: I will do a terrible job, but it\u2019s easy for me to come at this with beginner\u2019s ideas because I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m talking about. If people can hear the snap, like the, generally \u2013 please feel free to call bullshit on any of this.  Dave Elitch: No, no, you\u2019re good. Tim Ferriss: Like that, you\u2019re going to be hearing say a snare drum, right? Dave Elitch: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: When you look at drummers, and they have their hands seemingly crossed, they\u2019re hitting the high hat, and then they\u2019re hitting the snare with the other hand. That\u2019s part of the lifeblood of any kind of rock beat, right? Dave Elitch: And the kick drum with their foot. Tim Ferriss: So it\u2019s like [sound effects], that is the high hat and the snare. Then if you were to hear a drummer say travel left to right, assuming they\u2019re right-handed, like [sound effects], when you hear [sound effects] that part is very often going to be a floor tom.  Dave Elitch: Perfect. Perfect. I couldn\u2019t have done that better myself. Tim Ferriss: So you are right-handed? Dave Elitch: Yes. So you have a rack tom up top, straight in front of you, which is going to be the higher pitch, like [sound effects] and then you go down further, and you get bigger drums, which are sitting on the floor, floor toms, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So having those on the left is not normal. Dave Elitch: Not normal, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So why would you do that? Dave Elitch: So I put it on my left so I could put my notes on the left and didn\u2019t think anyone would see them. I go to the bathroom after the first set, and I come back, and it\u2019s all gone.  Tim Ferriss: Oh, fuck. Dave Elitch: Yeah. And I was like, \u201cUh\u2026\u201d and the bass player is like, \u201cIt\u2019s cool, man. You got it. It\u2019s all good. You don\u2019t need those.\u201d And I didn\u2019t.  Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re like, \u201cThanks, bass player who\u2019s done this set 400 times.\u201d Dave Elitch: Exactly, yeah, yeah. \u201cOkay, great.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: I want to note something for folks, and I\u2019m so glad we got into this because that particular way that you laid out your progression for practicing a song is nearly identical to how a lot of the best public speakers also prepare their keynotes. They will take a keynote \u2013 and I learned to do this as well, but I was borrowing from other people \u2013 and instead of \u2013 let\u2019s just say for the sake of simplicity, a 60-minute keynote \u2013 rather than trying to give the 60-minute keynote from start to finish, they\u2019ll break it into four pieces.  Or what they\u2019ll do \u2013 and this is something I started to model \u2013 is because the beginning and the ending is so important, actually breaking out the first five minutes and the last five minutes. Let\u2019s make it simple. If it\u2019s a 40-minute talk \u2013 this will make the math a little easier \u2013 first five minutes, then you have three 10-minute sections and then the last five minutes. And to practice each one of those individually, as opposed to in sequence. Initially, not paying attention to time, although having some rough idea of the total length. And then recording, listening to it, making these post-game analysis edits necessary.  And then also at a later point \u2013 and I picked this up from someone as well when I was practicing, you\u2019re talking about the bras and the panties and everything \u2013 when I was preparing for my TED talk about a year and a half ago, which was going to be the opening session, main stage, nervous as fuck. Just as a side note \u2013 I\u2019m sure you have a million of these, so I\u2019d love to hear some of these war stories \u2013 there\u2019s this area behind the stage at TED, which is called something hilarious like the Zen room or the chill-out room where the people who are on deck, like the three or four speakers who are on deck, are meant to hang out there with their little misters and cold water and so on.  You walk in there, at least when I walked in there, it was some of the most polished speakers in the world basically freaking the fuck out. I was like, \u201cI need to leave here now!\u201d Dave Elitch: This isn\u2019t helping.  Tim Ferriss: \u201cI need to leave right now.\u201d This is like being in the water with Bear Grylls and all his survival experts, and they\u2019re losing their shit because there are like great white sharks in the water. You\u2019re like, \u201cThis is not helpful. I need not to be here.\u201d But one of the things that I\u2019d done in the last week or so of preparation was to load myself up on way too much caffeine, like three or four coffees, before giving dress rehearsals before strangers at my friends\u2019 companies. I would have them call in people during lunch hour, and I would give a rehearsal in front of people who probably didn\u2019t particularly want to be there. Not a super-warm crowd, who don\u2019t care about my feelings, particularly.  Dave Elitch: And you\u2019re all jacked. Tim Ferriss: And I\u2019m jacked to try to simulate the adrenaline I would feel when I actually got out there.  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s smart, yeah. Tim Ferriss: In any case, I don\u2019t want to brain vomit on you too much.  Dave Elitch: No, it\u2019s all good. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll reserve some of my brain vomit for later. But the point being that progression you use applies to so many things. We\u2019re going to comment. You can see my fondling these \u2013 fondling is a strange word \u2013 but these gifts. Gifts, people! Get your mind out of the gutter \u2013 that you gave me, which I do want to talk about. You\u2019ve followed this progression song-by-song. You\u2019ve gone through the set twice. Hour before you get on stage, what does that hour look like? For that particular mercenary gig.  Dave Elitch: It\u2019s extremely stressful. You\u2019re waking up in the middle of the night going, \u201cHuh, huh, how does that bridge go?\u201d Like freaking out. Because you have the weight of the world on your shoulders. It\u2019s extremely stressful and in a lot of these situations \u2013 it was funny. I was thinking about how to sort of present this to the laymen. It\u2019s like your first day on the job. It\u2019s some really, you got like a giant promotion, or you\u2019re at a new company, different title, different role. And you roll in, and you meet everyone. You pick five random people out of the office, and you say, \u201cGreat. You guys are going to go on stage in front of 30,000 people together.\u201d You just met.  Or you\u2019re going to spend the next month in a bus together, waking up next to each other. It\u2019s a very weird situation. Who knows how that\u2019s going to work out as far as personalities and everything? But the hour before the show, I\u2019ve done the Sam Harris guided meditation. I just go to an area by myself and sit down and breathe and just try to stay as relaxed as possible.  Tim Ferriss: This is the 10-minute? Dave Elitch: Yeah.  Tim Ferriss: For people who don\u2019t know, this is Sam Harris, a neuroscience Ph.D. and also a very well-known author. I think he\u2019s at samharris.org, two R\u2019s, one S. He has a number of really good guided meditations. So you will have done that? Dave Elitch: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is that the morning of? Is that right before? Dave Elitch: Both. If I\u2019m feeling really anxious, I\u2019ll do it right before. One of the things that took years me years of touring to figure out is a lot of people will \u2013 drumming is an incredibly physical instrument, especially with how hard I can hit at times, and you really have to treat yourself like an athlete \u2013 a lot of people will sit there and \u201cwarm up\u201d on a rubber pad and gingerly hit it around for 10 or 15 minutes and then they go out onstage and their feet are cold. I started bringing a jump rope on tour with me. I was just like, \u201cOh, my God, how did I not figure this out earlier?\u201d  I skip rope for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and that gets the blood flowing so when I walk out onstage, I feel like I\u2019m three songs in already, which is a game changer, physiologically. I\u2019ll do that. It gets your head in the zone. Because skipping rope is the same exact thing as playing a musical instrument in terms of focus. It\u2019s like a detached focus. If you think about what you\u2019re doing, you use a different part of your brain neurologically, and you\u2019ll screw up whatever you\u2019re doing if it\u2019s a highly learned, embedded task.  So if you\u2019re skipping rope and you think about what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll hit your feet, and you\u2019ll screw it all up. If I\u2019m playing a show, I have to be either totally Zenned out and not thinking about anything at all or I have to think about what I\u2019m eating after the show or doing laundry or whatever. I can\u2019t think, \u201cHere comes this part\u201d or \u201cRight, right, left, left,\u201d or I\u2019ll immediately bungle whatever I\u2019m doing. But skipping rope gets my head in that mindset. It also gets me warmed up. So yeah, it\u2019s just a lot of pacing. I don\u2019t drink coffee or Red Bulls or anything because I know my heart rate\u2019s already going to be insane, so I try not to do that.  Tim Ferriss: Do you have anything that you, any particular rituals or things that you say to yourself before you go out or if you are, alternatively, do you take either or both of these \u2013 when you\u2019re talking to a professional who perhaps is really nervous about a tour they\u2019re about to do or gigs that they\u2019re doing, what\u2019s your advice to them right before they go out?  Dave Elitch: My advice is what I try to live by in that if you put the time in and you know the material, there\u2019s nothing to be nervous about because you know what you\u2019re doing. As soon as you get on stage, after about five minutes and the adrenaline wears off, you should be comfortable. Because you\u2019re like, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have put in more time. I put in the time. I know what I\u2019m doing. This is fine.\u201d What\u2019s really scary is when you don\u2019t have the time to put the work in; then that\u2019s freaky. I try to never put myself in those situations. But yeah, as long as you put in the time.  When I\u2019m working with someone, I make sure they put in the time. Usually, it\u2019s a lot of guys who\u2019ve been in bands for a long time. They have an ample amount; they might have a month of rehearsals. So it\u2019s not about whether I know this material. It\u2019s maybe some other issue. But I tell everyone to do the Sam Harris guided meditation, especially people who aren\u2019t familiar with that. Because when I first started doing it, I literally had to relearn how to breathe. Tim Ferriss: The guided meditation? Dave Elitch: Yeah. My breathing was \u2013 because I was driving to the studio and I was recording this record with this band called Antemasque that I did with Omar and Cedric from The Mars Volta after The Mars Volta. Flea was playing bass on it from the Chili Peppers. I had just finished doing the Killer Be Killed record, which is a metal band I was in, and I had to learn the Miley set after being in the studio all day with Antemasque. So I was driving to the studio, and I was white-knuckling the steering wheel, and I was holding my breath. I realized, \u201cOh, my God, am I doing this all the time?\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Is this my normal? Dave Elitch: Yeah. This is crazy. Then I started paying attention to it, and I realized I was holding my breath all the time. When I started doing the short guided meditation, I realized, \u201cOh, my God, I don\u2019t know how to breathe anymore.\u201d I had to literally learn how to take a full breath because I didn\u2019t, just from getting kicked in the balls over and over again and daily life, your breathing gets shallow. So that was massive for me.  As far as the rituals, that\u2019s huge. Even if I don\u2019t have time to sit down and fully do the meditation, I\u2019ll try and get into that headspace, because if you start your day with that, you can very easily go back and access that mindset later on. It\u2019s much easier for me to go, \u201cOkay, feeling stressed, okay, there\u2019s a full breath.\u201d Whereas if I didn\u2019t start my day off doing that, I might not physically be able to access that full breath. Tim Ferriss: Right. You haven\u2019t limbered up. Dave Elitch: Yes.  Tim Ferriss: Psychologically and physically.  Dave Elitch: Yeah, it\u2019s huge. Tim Ferriss: The breathing, facial tension. Yesterday you were asking me when I was sitting at the kit about the jaw and the mouth. We were chatting about that last night. Well, is it just from the standpoint of teaching, there are so many different skills that can be enhanced, oddly enough, by paying attention to mouth, jaw, tongue relaxation. We were chatting last night about \u201cIs it best to tell someone to relax the jaw, or is that too hard?\u201d And, in fact, if you ask someone to relax the tongue, do you get that entire structure to relax more easily?  All of which transcends music specifically. This is a conversation I\u2019ve had a lot with someone who\u2019s been on the podcast, Kelly Starrett, who always talks about breathing and positions. If you can\u2019t breathe in the position, you do not earn the position.  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s why I was so excited about doing this with you. Because I knew there was going to be tons of carryover from different disciplines. That\u2019s what I really love. So you telling me, \u201cIf you relax your tongue, you\u2019ll relax your whole face and your jaw.\u201d I was like, \u201cOf course.\u201d That\u2019s huge, and that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to present it to people from now on because that\u2019s a better way to teach it.  Tim Ferriss: You and I were having a conversation last night, romantic, candle-lit, hot tub conversation.  Dave Elitch: Amongst ice, ice baths. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. We did ice baths, which is also a great opportunity to work on breathing, big time.  Dave Elitch: Breathing. Holy shit.  Tim Ferriss: We can have a Round 2. We were chatting about, in part \u2013 we were talking about a lot of things \u2013 about what keeps me excited. My answer was seeing the interconnectedness and the transferability of these types of concepts because even if you bleed the stone and work in one area on one discipline, and you get to a point where perhaps you just feel fatigued and want to try something else, but you\u2019re not sure if you could ever recapture the excitement you felt in the nascent stages of that first dominant skill.  For me, I\u2019ve realized that there are thousands of different disciplines you could be exposed to and take to like a fish to water because you have knowingly or unknowingly developed all of these meta-skills that apply. You gave me a few gifts that I alluded to fondling earlier. One of them I\u2019m holding here, and I\u2019d love for you to tell people what it is and why you gave it to me. Dave Elitch: Sure. This is a book called The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey. It came out in 1974. It\u2019s one of those books where people are like, \u201cOh, yeah, that book.\u201d It had a huge effect, and there are all sorts of spinoffs. The Inner Game of Music is actually a book. The amazing thing with this book is \u2013 both of us have read a lot about Zen Buddhism \u2013 the thing about Zen Buddhism is by the very nature of what it is, it\u2019s very difficult to pin down and point at directly and define because it\u2019s so amorphous. This is the first thing I ever read where he nails it down in the context of tennis. It\u2019s easier to do that way. Tim Ferriss: Are you a tennis player?  Dave Elitch: I\u2019m not.  Tim Ferriss: This is important.  Dave Elitch: Yeah. So the book talks about essentially these two selves that we have. Self 1 and Self 2. Self 1 is the analytical, cruel self-talk, harsh critic who you hit the ball into the net \u2013 if we\u2019re going to stick with the tennis analogy \u2013 and Self 1 is like, \u201cOh, you fucking piece of shit. Come on, get it together.\u201d And Self 2 is your subconscious automatic self that\u2019s just, \u201cHey, I\u2019m just trying to make this happen here.\u201d The whole idea is calming down the critical, analytical Self 1, your self-talk, and letting Self 2, the automatic subconscious, take over. If you let that happen, everything will happen automatically.  So what\u2019s interesting is what I do with so many people is very technique oriented. This book can be described as an anti-technique because it\u2019s sort of the opposite way of coming about it. But what\u2019s interesting about this is with the Zen stuff, they will lead you down a path and then just leave you there, a lot of times. The brilliant thing with this book is it\u2019s very easy to understand. Anyone can pick it up and learn. You can replace tennis with any other thing, any other discipline.  The brilliant thing about this book is it takes you somewhere and he\u2019s like, this is a plateau you have to overcome and this is how you do it. That happens multiple times in the book. Tim Ferriss: This is the problem. Here are a few approaches to resolving the problem. Dave Elitch: As a for-instance, if you\u2019re really getting in your head \u2013 I\u2019ll stick with the tennis analogy \u2013 in a match, and you need a device to overcome that Self 1, because like I was saying earlier, if you think physiologically about what you\u2019re doing in terms of movement, you use a different structure in your brain and you\u2019ll botch it. So if you\u2019re serving a tennis ball, you throw the ball up, you go, \u201cI throw the ball up, then I move my racquet,\u201d you\u2019re fucked. You\u2019re going to hit the net every time. So in order to not do that, he\u2019ll say, \u201cFocus on the laces of the ball as it\u2019s coming at you\u201d or \u201cFocus on the whop of the sound when you get a good hit\u201d and just focus on those things in and of themselves that will take you into that space. We were talking about this last night. Everyone that talks about being in the zone or being on that fire, that kind of thing, as a state you can willingly inhabit, it\u2019s not really a thing. It\u2019s not really true. You can set the stage for it by this type of thing, but you can\u2019t willingly enter into that or else everybody would do that all the time. When I\u2019m having these out-of-body experiences when I\u2019m playing music, which is what gets you to do it in the first place, sort of time slows down and unfolds in front of you and you see what you\u2019re going to play.  Tim Ferriss: Neo back-bending with the bullets flying by? Dave Elitch: It\u2019s exactly the same thing. That\u2019s what got me hooked. That Matrix thing. You can use that in any discipline.  Tim Ferriss: And you can\u2019t, as you said, guarantee that you can follow the boot-up sequence and automatically enter flow at any point in time, but you can increase the odds. Dave Elitch: Sure, absolutely.  Tim Ferriss: You can increase the odds. Dave Elitch: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: You were mentioning it in the context of tennis or a tennis serve, but last night when we were tooling around on the drum kit, it\u2019s very similar, right?  Dave Elitch: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: You were asking me to note the difference in sound from switching from a French grip, thumb on top, to a German grip, which is all more internally rotated. Dave Elitch: Yeah, a flat hand. Tim Ferriss: Flatter hand. But using the wrist. Dave Elitch: As a whip. Tim Ferriss: As a whip for rim shot or on the snare drum. You were asking me to notice the feel and the sound of it. Dave Elitch: What\u2019s amazing about this is we\u2019re playing an electronic kit. We\u2019re not playing an acoustic kit. So even though you\u2019re hearing sounds, theoretically, it shouldn\u2019t really sound any different because it\u2019s not real. You know what I mean?  Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dave Elitch: But that\u2019s what\u2019s even cooler about this. Being on an electronic kit is once we got you relaxing and getting those techniques happening, and trimming the fat, your vibe and your feel were totally different, even in that situation.  Tim Ferriss: The sound or the queuing into that sound or feeling, much like anyone who has played tennis, and I\u2019ve played very little tennis, knows the gratification of that proper thwack when you really hit it in the sweet spot or anyone who\u2019s boxed and found that sweet spot on a heavy bag. It acts as an anchor for the 27 biomechanical ingredients that make it up, but if you try to recall the 27 separate ingredients discretely when you\u2019re pulling your arm back to hit the ball, you\u2019re fucked.  Dave Elitch: You hit the nail on the head, man. That is exactly the kind of stuff that I find so exciting are those carryovers. When you hit a home run, when you smash a baseball, it doesn\u2019t feel like you did anything. Whereas if you hit it wonky, you\u2019re like [sound effects]. You know what I mean? It\u2019s terrible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dave Elitch: It\u2019s the same thing with drums. When you hit them right, the energy should be going out, not back in. It\u2019s the same with anything else, any athletic movement.  Tim Ferriss: You gave this book, The Inner Game of Tennis, to \u2013 and we\u2019re definitely going to come back to this topic \u2013 to your therapist, who is 81? Dave Elitch: Something like that, yeah. Tim Ferriss: 80-something and a very wise woman. It now has a prominent place on her shelf. Dave Elitch: Yeah, it has a spot on her mantle. One of the five or six books she gives out to people regularly. Tim Ferriss: I didn\u2019t ask you this because I don\u2019t think you mentioned the five or six other books, but do you know offhand any of the other books? Dave Elitch: The Pia Mellody, Facing Love Addiction, is one of them. Tim Ferriss: Pia Mellody, P-I-A Mellody. Dave Elitch: Yeah. I don\u2019t know the other ones.  Tim Ferriss: We can make that a bonus feature for the show notes.  Dave Elitch: I\u2019ll look closer next time.  Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ll put those in the show notes. Let\u2019s take a look at these other two because I think they are also a fun way to dissect you a bit. Let\u2019s go with this one next. This is a very small book, and I always get excited about small books.  Dave Elitch: One would not think that.  Tim Ferriss: One would not think that. Every time I set out to write a 20-page children\u2019s book, it ends up being a 700-page bludgeoning tool. This is titled The Medium is the Massage. Subtitled, An Inventory of Effects. Marshall McLuhan? Is that how you say it?  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s it.  Tim Ferriss: M, little C, uppercase L-U-H-A-N. And Quentin Fiore? Is he the graphic designer? Dave Elitch: Yes.  Tim Ferriss: And then produced, I didn\u2019t even notice that, by Jerome Agel, I suppose, something like that. Dave Elitch: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Who knows. That\u2019s not something I typically see associated with books, so I\u2019m not sure what that means. Tell me about this book. Dave Elitch: Marshall McLuhan was a really interesting and very popular social and media theorist in the \u201850s and \u201860s, so I find it really fascinating that he\u2019s not a household name now, being that media is such a massive part of everyone\u2019s life now, especially people who do their own thing. We have to have Instagram and Twitter and all that stuff. You don\u2019t have a choice, right? So I find societal issues and media and how we process and consume media very interesting. This dude was so ahead of everyone by decades. It\u2019s almost creepy. Tim Ferriss: Just in terms of his predictive ability? Dave Elitch: Yeah. The interesting thing about him is he would spout off all sorts of inflammatory, crazy things. People would get furious about certain things, or pick things apart. He would contradict himself all the time, and make these grand statements. That maybe would\u2019ve bothered me years ago, but now, as long as there are gems throughout and he hits the nail on the head in certain areas, and I can take away things that shift my perspective as a whole, that\u2019s all that matters to me. So The Medium is the Message. This is actually The Medium is the Massage because they screwed up when they \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s so funny. I didn\u2019t even notice that.  Dave Elitch: I know. They screwed up when they were printing it originally, and he thought it was hilarious and he\u2019s like, just leave it, it\u2019s fine. So it was supposed to be The Medium is the Message, but it\u2019s actually The Medium is the Massage. He\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s great. Let\u2019s keep it. Dave Elitch: He loved puns. He was kind of a quirky, weird dude. The whole idea of that phrase is that the medium with which information is submitted to you is more important than the actual information itself. An example I like to use is something like Auto-Tune. For people who don\u2019t know what Auto-Tune is, if you think of that Cher song Do you Believe in Love, whatever, that was 20 years ago. Auto-Tune is a software that people use to correct someone\u2019s vocal take. So if someone\u2019s vocal take is wonky, they just sort of massage it a little bit. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s been used quite a bit in hip-hop. Dave Elitch: Yes. What the new thing with that Cher song is they used a different key signature to Auto-Tune it, so it way over-corrected itself, and that\u2019s what got that weird, now T-Pain sort of sound. Drake. As something that was an experiment, now has currently changed the way music is. The software itself has now changed the art form to the point where I\u2019ll have producer friends of mine tracking someone doing vocals in their 20s, and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, why does my voice sound weird?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s what your voice sounds like.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Oh, uncorrected? Dave Elitch: They expect it to sound Auto-Tuned. So the technology has now affected the art form. Tim Ferriss: It not only changed the content, but it also changed the perception of the raw materials. Dave Elitch: Yeah. And you could say the same thing about, there\u2019s something called Beat Detective, which is something drummers the world over hate. It\u2019s the same sort of a thing for drummers. So you can track something, record something in a studio, and then they will artificially adjust everything to a grid. If someone\u2019s lazy about it, they snap it to the grid, and it\u2019s just like [sound effects], it\u2019s very stiff and computer-like because that\u2019s what it\u2019s been turned into. Tim Ferriss: Spock on drums. Dave Elitch: Exactly. But people got used to hearing that.  Tim Ferriss: Can you remove the soul from my music? Dave Elitch: Yeah. So I\u2019ve done sessions where I\u2019ll go in, and I think I\u2019ve done a pretty good job. Then I\u2019ll hear it back, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy did you even have me play on this?\u201d Because they\u2019re just lazy. It\u2019s more about them being lazy and not going through and, you know. But people got used to hearing how quote, unquote \u201cperfect\u201d that is. And if someone hears something that rushes or drags or is a little bit not perfect, they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is weird.\u201d And so a lot of things are Beat-Detected to the point where it\u2019s just totally artificial now. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve drained the blood. Dave Elitch: Yes. And then the pendulum will swing back. That\u2019s why Adele was so successful, because it was real music. Tim Ferriss: And Jack Johnson. Dave Elitch: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: You do have the pendulum sometimes swing in the opposite direction. Is your interest in this \u2013 because I know it\u2019s not limited just to this book \u2013 and, one, I wanted to bring up you have mentioned this to me many times. In fact, this is a documentary series that has come up repeatedly on this podcast. I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I still have not seen it. Adam Curtis\u2019 BBC documentary series, The Century of the Self and HyperNormalisation. So you\u2019ve said it changed the way that you saw the world forever. I\u2019ll just continue here.  Even if you just check out \u2013 these are your words \u2013 the first 20 minutes of Century of the Self, it\u2019ll blow your mind. Maybe you could segue into The Century of the Self and HyperNormalisation. Tell me why this is so interesting to you. Because this seems to be fanatically something that is of great interest to you. We were just talking about Beat Detective and other things. People might assume it\u2019s because he\u2019s a musician and it\u2019s how these things affect music. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. So could you talk about how you found Century of the Self? Because it has come up surprisingly frequently on this podcast. And why does it grab your attention?  Dave Elitch: My buddy, Chris, is a musician friend of mine. He told me about it years ago. I think it came out in 2000. I\u2019d have to double-check that. The premise of Century of the Self is it starts with focusing on Edward Bernays. Edward Bernays was Sigmund Freud\u2019s nephew. He took all of Sigmund Freud\u2019s theories on the subconscious and came to the conclusion that human beings are either savage animals that are going to rip each other apart, or they can be controlled and made docile via consumerism.  Tim Ferriss: The opiate for the masses. Dave Elitch: Yeah, it\u2019s literally that. Edward Bernays used some of these tactics that he pioneered in propaganda for World War I. Then after World War I, he was like, \u201cWell, we can use these in peacetime for capitalists.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Selling more detergent. Dave Elitch: Yes. So the whole notion of you buying a pair of shoes to express your inner self was single-handedly formulated by him. So we think that\u2019s just always been around. But really, before him, if people were thirsty, they drank water. They would wear shirts for years. As that dude who I\u2019m a big fan of, Slavoj\u00a0\u017di\u017eek \u2013 Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re going to come back to this. He\u2019s a Slovenian philosopher. S-L-A-V-O-J. Second name, Z-I-Z-E-K. Amazing name. Please continue. Dave Elitch: Amazing person. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ll come back to that.  Dave Elitch: What he talks about, he says once you drink Coke instead of water, the excess is with us forever. You can\u2019t go backward. He did interesting things like having a bunch of women smoke cigarettes. There was some sort of subconscious phallic connotation with that. But at the time, women didn\u2019t smoke. He hired a bunch of attractive women to smoke in a parade or in public or something, to get it sort of \u201ctrending.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like having the celebrity wear the sneakers.  Dave Elitch: Exactly. So he created focus groups. He created the idea of PR. This is all him. So this guy single-handedly shaped America as we know it. Of course, America affects everything else in the world. Up until recently, anyway. Especially the world we live in now with Instagram and social media. He\u2019s maybe the most influential person in terms of society. Tim Ferriss: Whose name most people don\u2019t recognize. Dave Elitch: Yeah. It blows my mind. He would be a household name.  Tim Ferriss: This is Edward Bernays. Dave Elitch: Yes. The documentary \u2013 Tim Ferriss: B-E-R-N-A-Y-S, for people wondering.  Dave Elitch: What\u2019s interesting is you would think he made himself famous via Sigmund Freud, but it was actually the other way around. He took all of his tactics and made Sigmund Freud into Sigmund Freud. It\u2019s crazy.  Tim Ferriss: That I didn\u2019t, I had no idea. That\u2019s really wild. Dave Elitch: It\u2019s four one-hour episodes and the first episode \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The Century of the Self. Dave Elitch: Yeah. It\u2019s called Happiness Machines. That\u2019s the first episode. Adam Curtis has a really interesting style of making these documentaries. I saw him do a talk in Los Angeles when HyperNormalisation came out in 2016. He said, \u201cThese aren\u2019t really documentaries. They\u2019re kind of just things that I make.\u201d They\u2019re almost like video essays or collages. McLuhan talks a lot about that, presenting things as sort of a star pattern of images because language is sometimes insufficient to convey the ideas. It can be like a weird collage. I show this documentary to people, and they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It\u2019s really strange. The music is really weird and bizarre. Tim Ferriss: Which one are you talking about? Dave Elitch: Sorry. I\u2019m talking about \u2013 Tim Ferriss: HyperNormalisation? Dave Elitch: Either one. Anything Adam Curtis has made is the same style. It\u2019s four one-hour episodes, and it goes all the way up until the Clinton administration because this idea, this Edward Bernays stuff weaves its way into politics. It goes into other things too. That completely changed the way I think about everything. I think about it every day. Tim Ferriss: What would be an example? Is it just that you\u2019re aware of the way your subconscious is being manipulated? Is it that you view other individual and collective behavior differently because you question the free will ingredient? How does it on a day-to-day basis impact how you think about things or view reality? Dave Elitch: It\u2019s all of that. If we\u2019re talking about consumerism, if I want to buy something, whatever it is, a drink or a snare drum, which I buy a lot of, or some art, which I also buy a lot of, I think, \u201cWhy do I want this? What\u2019s driving this?\u201d A lot of times, the answer is different than what you think what it may be. Tim Ferriss: Or what you want it to be. Dave Elitch: Yeah. A lot of times you\u2019re filling the void. That\u2019s a whole other topic \u2013 existential angst. Tim Ferriss: That is a big topic. Dave Elitch: But that\u2019s why a lot of people are buying things. To make themselves feel better. Tim Ferriss: I heard this quote not too long ago. It\u2019s actually in a collection of quotes. I\u2019m such a promiscuous quote reader. But there\u2019s one, and I don\u2019t know the attribution. Someone out there on the internet can certainly indicate who the proper attribution is. I\u2019ll put it in the show notes as well. I\u2019ll write down this note: mankind existential animal quote question mark. The quote is along the lines of, \u201cMan is the only animal for which his own existence is a problem to be solved.\u201d Dave Elitch: I love that. Yeah, I love that. That\u2019s it right there. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like, my dog, Molly, does not seem preoccupied. At all.  Dave Elitch: No, she\u2019s just having a good time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You mentioned artwork. We\u2019re going to come back to some music, and we\u2019re also going to jump into some of the rapid-fire questions that I love to ask. We\u2019ve known each other for quite a while, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked, certainly 90% of those that we\u2019re going to be coming up on. The artwork. I follow you on Instagram, and I love your drumming. Dave Elitch: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: So don\u2019t take this the wrong way. I find the artwork that you discover to be fascinating. Dave Elitch: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: And strange. Dave Elitch: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re welcome. So I use your account also as a way of discovering different types of design and art. Have you always been interested in visual art, and if not, how did that become what seems like an important part of your life? I don\u2019t know if it is. Dave Elitch: Yeah, it\u2019s a very important part of my life. Tim Ferriss: How did it become important? Why is it important? Dave Elitch: I used to make art. I used to draw a lot and do watercolors when I was a kid. Then when I started playing drums, really young, like five, six, seven. Then when I started playing drums, I didn\u2019t do anything else. It took my full mental capacity. So that sort of fell by the wayside. I hit a certain point in my career if you just have those blinders on and you\u2019re myopic about something because you\u2019re very focused and driven, you end up burning out eventually. Touring is incredibly stressful. I hit a wall a few years ago. Tim Ferriss: How old are you know? Dave Elitch: 34. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So like 31, 32? Dave Elitch: Something like that, yeah. I turned to art as a sort of oblique form of inspiration. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t want to hijack the flow here. When you say hit a wall, is that physical fatigue? What do you mean by that? Dave Elitch: Mental fatigue, mostly. We were sort of talking about this last night. You get to a certain point where you check all the boxes of things that you\u2019ve wanted to do. I got to a certain point where I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve done everything that I wanted to do career-wise. Now, what do I do?\u201d Also, I was talking to Jimmy Chamberlin about this. He\u2019s a good friend of mine, and I\u2019ve been helping him out a little bit. Tim Ferriss: Who is that? Dave Elitch: He plays drums for The Smashing Pumpkins. We were having breakfast a few months ago, and we were talking about the same type of thing. He was saying people are like, \u201cMan, this is great. Your band is doing so well.\u201d Or, \u201cYou\u2019re doing all these tours and isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d I was saying, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not amazing. I always knew I was going to do this. This isn\u2019t a surprise to me. I always knew this was going to happen.\u201d In a way, it\u2019s hard to get to the top of Mt. Everest and be like, \u201cI did it.\u201d Because you\u2019re like, \u201cDuh, of course I did it.\u201d Tim Ferriss: When you say, \u201cI knew it was going to happen,\u201d how much of that \u2013 and there certainly could be an Option C, D, and E \u2013 but how much of that is \u201cI knew it was going to happen because I knew I was really good,\u201d versus \u201cI\u2019m just doing my fucking job. As a professional drummer, I am putting in the work, and therefore it is my job ultimately to do X, Y, and Z, and I did X, Y, and Z, so why would I pat myself on the back for doing my job?\u201d Or something else? Dave Elitch: Sort of both. It\u2019s just like I\u2019m \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Because I have a lot of the latter. I\u2019ve struggled with that quite a bit. \u00a0 Dave Elitch: I\u2019m going to work harder than you are and I\u2019m going to be the first in and the last out. If this guy can make it work, I can certainly make it work. It\u2019s really that sort of thing. I always say this to people I\u2019m working with. I\u2019m saying, look, you can have a good amount of innate ability at whatever you\u2019re doing, but the person who puts the work in is always going to surpass you. If you have a little bit of innate ability, like I think I do, and you work harder than anyone else, obviously there\u2019s a certain amount of luck involved in anything which you can\u2019t do anything about. But there was no other option.  With the thing I was talking about with Jimmy, is he was like, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy down to the molecular, atomic level. If you\u2019re operating from that state, things will unfold in that manner because you\u2019re working in that. Not the secret kind of bullshit. Not that crap. He recommended this book to me, and I have so many books I have to read. Is it like On Becoming Yourself? [Ed. Note: Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself by Dr. Joe Dispenza] It\u2019s super popular right now. I\u2019ll have to look it up.  Tim Ferriss: I wonder who wrote it. Dave Elitch: I have it.  Tim Ferriss: Is it Krista Tippett? Dave Elitch: No. She\u2019s great though.  Tim Ferriss: She is, yeah. Dave Elitch: I\u2019m reading this Ellen Langer book called Mindfulness, which you\u2019re going to super dig.  Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve watched you carrying it around. Dave Elitch: Yeah, it\u2019s so good. Ellen Langer was on her podcast. That\u2019s how I found out about her. Tim Ferriss: All right. We will follow up. So Jimmy recommended a book that maybe On Becoming something or other.  Dave Elitch: God, I have to look it up. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the gist of the book or why did he recommend it? Dave Elitch: It basically goes way into that in terms of a scientific vantage point. How all of that stuff works. It\u2019s very scientific. Tim Ferriss: When you say bad stuff, you mean when you place yourself on a certain direction and make thousands of micro-decisions that are subconsciously aligned with that direction? How things unfold? Dave Elitch: Yes. How does that work scientifically instead of some voodoo, weird, I want a new car, so I\u2019m going to put that into the universe and then it\u2019ll just happen.  Tim Ferriss: It makes me think \u2013 again, I\u2019m going to blame it on the caffeine, but I just like jumping around and interjecting because I\u2019m too hyperactive \u2013 we were talking about Maria Bamford, who is a fucking amazing comedian. At one point, she was doing this bit on having read The Secret. She said, \u201cI went home, and I created a vision board. And on my vision board, I had all the things I wanted, and my sister came over.\u201d  Her sister apparently is some very successful lawyer or something. Her sister comes over, very Type A and her sister is like, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s my vision board.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYou have a microwave on your vision board?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cA fucking microwave? That\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ll buy you a fucking microwave.\u201d And then Maria\u2019s like, \u201cBam! Manifest!\u201d  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s awesome. Tim Ferriss: So we\u2019re not talking about trying to make that happen? Dave Elitch: No. But I haven\u2019t read it yet, so I\u2019m kind of talking out of my ass here. But he was saying it\u2019s incredible.  Tim Ferriss: How did he think it would help you? Why did he prescribe that?  Dave Elitch: Because we were talking about it anyway and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, have you read this book?\u201d That\u2019s sort of what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s in the queue. I haven\u2019t gotten to it yet.  Tim Ferriss: What did he share with you or what were his thoughts on this position that you find yourself in? Where it\u2019s like, \u201cAll right, I seem to have some degree of innate ability for this particular field. I was drawn to it. I\u2019ve applied myself very diligently\u201d over, at this point, decades, right? Dave Elitch: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: \u201cI\u2019ve done what I want to do. Now what?\u201d And you said something; I don\u2019t know if you want to debut it here or not. I said, \u201cOh my God, you should put that on social media just to further outsource your self-esteem,\u201d which I think is social media in a nutshell. Do you want to take a stab at it? Dave Elitch: I said, \u201cAnyone who says do what you love for a living and you\u2019ll never work a day in your life hasn\u2019t done what they want to do for a living.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you do anything day in, day out for decades, there\u2019s a point where you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay.\u201d Dave Elitch: Even to the point where I\u2019m doing these tours where I\u2019m super stressed out. You\u2019re walking onstage in an arena for 15,000 people at Staples Center or whatever and you\u2019re like, \u201cUgh.\u201d After a week, once I have the show down, I\u2019m like, \u201cUgh, whatever. Making the doughnuts.\u201d Especially if it\u2019s a pop thing because it\u2019s literally the same thing. If it\u2019s something more improvised, that\u2019s a little bit more exciting. There\u2019s something that happens that I have to help people out who are on tour for a year and a half or two years and it\u2019s pop context. Tim Ferriss: Holy shit. I didn\u2019t realize tours were that long. Fuck. Dave Elitch: Oh, yeah, dude. Album cycle? Totally. So you\u2019re playing the exact same thing, note-for-note, day in, day out. Tim Ferriss: So it\u2019s like being on a book tour until your next book comes out, basically? Dave Elitch: Yup. Well, and then you\u2019ll take a break. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ll do some recording. Dave Elitch: You\u2019ll take a break, do a new record. But yeah, it\u2019s intense. You\u2019re out with the same people, the same techs. You\u2019re away from your family. It\u2019s pretty rough. Something that happens to people is they\u2019re playing the same thing over and over and over again. I mean literally note-for-note. If you\u2019re playing pop, like when I was doing Miley, that\u2019s a massive production. It\u2019s like eight busses, 12 semis. The stage production is insane. I\u2019m going up, up, above, and down, above and below the stage. There\u2019s a huge video wall. She\u2019s riding a giant hot dog 20 feet above the air in the arena. There\u2019s a lot of things that go on there.  So you can\u2019t do anything differently because the dancers will be like, what just happened? So you have people playing the exact same thing note-for-note for a year and a half, two years, and they start to lose their mind because it\u2019s so monotonous and representative.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s like the polar bear doing the lap in the one 10-foot pool in the enclosure. Dave Elitch: Exactly. It\u2019s exactly the same thing. What starts happening is your brain starts creating weird quagmires for you to fall into because it\u2019s bored.  Tim Ferriss: What would be an example of that? Dave Elitch: So for instance, you\u2019ll get to a certain part, and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I play that? It\u2019s not hard to play.\u201d There was a guy I was working with who has played with Janet Jackson for a year, a lot of people. He\u2019s a fantastic drummer. He had some issues with his foot. He went to see someone in Atlanta, like a neurologist. She had some helmet that he put on. We were looking at the technique, the physical issues. I guess there were some parts of his brain that were turned off to control the foot. It\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t know how that technology works, but your brain will fuck with you.  There were times with The Mars Volta or with Miley or whatever where I would be like, \u201cOh, here comes this part.\u201d You\u2019re already dead in the water. Or when I was doing M83, there was one section where I would hear the beat in the wrong place.  Tim Ferriss: Weird. You had like an auditory hallucination. Dave Elitch: Yes. It was a very simple section. I remember at sound check, me going like, \u201cWhoa, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d This is like, and your brain is like, \u201cI need something to do.\u201d It\u2019s crazy. I forgot why I got on that tangent. Tim Ferriss: We were talking about Jimmy and climbing Everest and what his thoughts were on what to do. Dave Elitch: We were talking about this sort of last night. In certain situations, there aren\u2019t a lot of people you can talk to about certain things, right? So we were just going back and forth with that type of thing. The thing with him is he is in a band that\u2019s still huge. This is the thing that\u2019s uncontrollable in the music industry. There are tons of parables here. I can work really hard, and it doesn\u2019t matter if my band makes it or not in a way that if you really hit the lottery, that\u2019s totally outside of your control.  They put in all the hard work, but that band hit the lottery. That is out of your control. But again, you can sort of set the stage for it. Where he\u2019s coming from, because he\u2019s in a band that is huge, is totally different from someone like me, who is a mercenary.  Tim Ferriss: A Blackwater sniper of drumming technicians.  Dave Elitch: Totally. It\u2019s a totally different thing. He\u2019s very intelligent and a great player, and a really great guy, too. He\u2019s amazing. You guys would get along really well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I\u2019d love to meet him. Dave Elitch: Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: How long has he been the drummer? Dave Elitch: He took a break for a while and then he recently got back together with them, and they\u2019re on tour right now doing their new record. Tim Ferriss: Cool. There are so many tracks that just fueled me through so many parts of college and other points \u2013 Zero, Bullet with Butterfly Wings.  Dave Elitch: Yeah, dude. I love that song. Tim Ferriss: So amazing. I think we should maybe jump into some rapid fire. And we will incorporate this. Thank you for the index finger point. We\u2019re not going to miss this, because you mentioned a word earlier, which is a very useful word, \u201coblique.\u201d We\u2019re not talking about the sides of your abs. Although I suppose we are. It\u2019s used in that context here. We\u2019re going to come back and talk about Oblique Strategies. But first, since we\u2019ve consumed several black teas, several green teas, several Topo Chicos, and are working our way through a couple of cappuccinos and more green tea, we\u2019ll talk a short bio break and return for your listening pleasure. We\u2019ll be right back. And we\u2019re back, as promised. Oblique Strategies. This is a black case that is holding what looks like a deck of cards. This deck of cards has all sorts of things written on them. The first two which I pulled out yesterday, which were highly relevant to a number of corners I\u2019ve painted myself into recently, where Card No. 1 \u2013 simple subtraction. Card No. 2 \u2013 what mistakes did you make last time? What are these Oblique Strategies? Dave Elitch: They\u2019re cards that Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt made together in 1975.  Tim Ferriss: Who are those two people? Dave Elitch: Brian Eno is a super-famous musician. He\u2019s done a lot of different things over the years, but he was first famous with the band, Roxy Music. He went on later to pioneer ambient music with Music for Airports.  Tim Ferriss: Literally music for airports?  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s what the record is called. It\u2019s called Music for Airports. Sorry, I should have clarified that. Tim Ferriss: I feel like they would get along with McLuhan and The Medium is the Massage.  Dave Elitch: He wanted to make something that neither had a beginning or an end, and you could tune in and out of, and it didn\u2019t really matter. He\u2019s a very interesting, brilliant person. These are strategies when you\u2019re making anything. This is in the context of making music, but you can obviously apply them to anything. The device is to knock you out of your present state of mind. Like you said when you paint yourself into a corner. You\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of this.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Or you just feel like you\u2019ve painted yourself into a corner. Dave Elitch: Sure. Well, that\u2019s a whole other thing, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dave Elitch: There\u2019s a whole deck of cards that are very simple, minimalist suggestions. The ones that you picked out, you already said. But if we pick out a few random ones.  Tim Ferriss: Tidy up. Do something boring. The most important thing is the thing most easily forgotten. Ain\u2019t that the truth? Overtly resist change. Discipline self-indulgence. So these are prompts, in a way? Dave Elitch: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: For getting unstuck or un-fucked.  Dave Elitch: I\u2019ve had a set of these for years, and I thought you would be super into these.  Tim Ferriss: How do you use these cards? I\u2019ll just buy a little bit of time because I notice there\u2019s a description card, which I hadn\u2019t noticed earlier. \u201cThese cards evolved from separate observations of the principles underlying what we were doing.\u201d What we were doing, I\u2019m imagining, is very much musically related. \u201cBut sometimes they were recognized in retrospect, i.e., intellect catching up with intuition. Sometimes they were identified as they were happening. Sometimes they were formulated. They can be used as a pack.  A set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind, or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. In this case, the card is trusted, even if its appropriateness is quite unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present themselves and others will become self-evident.\u201d Dave Elitch: There you go.  Tim Ferriss: How do you use or how have you used these cards? Dave Elitch: I always think about them in terms of how I\u2019m supporting music for the greater good. A lot of times in an improvised context, these are very applicable. Because with an instrument such as drums, guitar, piano, or bass, where you don\u2019t have to breathe to play it, you run the risk of vomit chops.  Tim Ferriss: What does that mean? Dave Elitch: It means you can just play as much as you want. If you\u2019re playing a wind instrument, you literally have to breathe, so that affects your phrasing. So you can pause. With drumming, you don\u2019t have to do that. You can play a million miles an hour forever. After two minutes, the listener wants to kill themselves. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s true. There isn\u2019t as much of a \u2013 there is a biological limiter, but it\u2019s not as obvious to the listener. Dave Elitch: No. Yeah, with saxophone or something, you have to breathe every 15 or 20 seconds, so you have to have a space. That clich\u00e9 thing of it\u2019s not about what you play; it\u2019s about what you don\u2019t play, that\u2019s clich\u00e9 for a reason. It\u2019s really true. That\u2019s something that I try to focus on a lot because if you have a lot of facility, it\u2019s very easy to just barf all over the place and overwhelm everyone.  Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m not a musician, as I\u2019ve stated repeatedly. I remember someone said to me, music is the space between the notes. I was like, \u201cOoh, interesting.\u201d  Dave Elitch: With drumming, especially because you\u2019re keeping time for everyone, it\u2019s a very meditative state. A lot of people will count in between the notes, and they\u2019ll be very precise about it. I\u2019ve always tried to be very Zen about it and just feel the void in between the notes that you\u2019re playing. It\u2019s two totally different ways of doing it. Depending on what you\u2019re doing at the moment, one could be better than the other. But yeah, man.  Tim Ferriss: Give me an example, if you could. It could be hypothetical. When would you pull out this deck and be like, \u201cAll right, I really feel like I need one of these cards.\u201d  Dave Elitch: I do a lot of the body mechanic stuff with people. I also have people who are just like, \u201cHey dude, give me a bunch of cool, crazy licks to play. Song enders. [Sound effects]. That kind of a thing.\u201d I did that with my buddy, Stacy Jones, who is Miley\u2019s MD and drummer.  Tim Ferriss: MD? Dave Elitch: Musical director, sorry. Tim Ferriss: I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a combo. Let me finish this song and then here\u2019s an EpiPen.\u201d Dave Elitch: He was like, \u201cHey dude, I just want to get some rad song enders.\u201d It was like, \u201cGreat. We can totally do that.\u201d So I showed him a bunch of licks, and we had fun. This is the kind of situation that\u2019s great for these because people, after you\u2019re working on phrasing, after about 20 minutes, they\u2019ve played everything they know. Then they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, what do I do now?\u201d So you could just pick something out of the deck. Like you just picked out \u201cGive the game away.\u201d How you interpret that, you could go a number of ways.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It\u2019s like \u201cSlow down\u201d on your shirt. Anyone who picks that up, they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cWhat does it mean to you?\u201d You could therapize them.  Dave Elitch: Yeah, exactly. For me, the first way I would process that is a lot of times when you\u2019re building up solos, you don\u2019t do that. You want to lead someone in and sort of set the stage. Because if you start off on \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Don\u2019t give them the filet mignon as the appetizer.  Dave Elitch: Exactly. This, to me, the way I would interpret this is, I\u2019m going to come in guns blazing and then try to work my way out of that because that\u2019s the biggest no-no. I\u2019m going to do that on purpose and then see what happens. Someone could also say, if you\u2019re thinking about a sports analogy, \u201cI\u2019m just going to play the game and see what happens.\u201d Let it happen on its own. It\u2019s not about winning or losing.  Tim Ferriss: Cool. I dig it. This is good timing for me.  Dave Elitch: Great. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ve talked a lot about playing in front of huge crowds and the musicians you work with. Certainly, this show tends to feature people who are very good at something or another. I would like to talk about failures or disappointments. This is a question I really enjoy asking. How has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success? It could be a disappointment or anything. Do you have any particular favorite failures or failures that come to mind that were in retrospect very valuable? Dave Elitch: I\u2019ve gone out for auditions for plenty of bands, and I haven\u2019t gotten gigs. That\u2019s just how it goes. If you go in there and, again, you\u2019re really prepared, and you fully present yourself accurately, and they don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s not the right fit, what else can you do? You might think, \u201cI didn\u2019t get the gig; it\u2019s a failure.\u201d But what about if you \u2013 it\u2019s the same thing as dating, right? What if you present a fake version of yourself, and then they like that, and then you have to keep doing that, and then you\u2019re like, \u201cWho am I?\u201d There\u2019s plenty of situations where I go in doing the Dave smash thing like in that Mars Volta video, and they\u2019re like, \u201cHoly shit, Jesus Christ.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Get a restraining order. Dave Elitch: And it\u2019s too much, and they get freaked out. And it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I might not be that guy all the time, but that\u2019s definitely possible.\u201d A real-life situation, which is what I always try to talk about because that\u2019s the most important thing. So many people run into problems when they \u2013 it\u2019s hyperbole. When I was out with The 1975 maybe a couple of years ago, George, the drummer, I\u2019ve been teaching him for a while, and he broke his collarbone on tour. This was the same type of situation.  Tim Ferriss: How did he break his collarbone? Maybe it\u2019s not for family programming.  Dave Elitch: I don\u2019t know. But he was just like, \u201cDude, I broke my collarbone.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Good recovery. Continue.  Dave Elitch: I was like, \u201cWho knows?\u201d He was like, \u201cCan you come out here and fill in?\u201d It\u2019s the same type of situation. I have to learn all the music last minute. It\u2019s really large venues, arenas. I show up in Toronto, meet everyone. We have a line check on stage, which is you make sure all the connections are working. We run through a couple of songs, maybe. Tim Ferriss: The people attempting to assemble my drum kit did not do this.  Dave Elitch: That was another thing. I\u2019m like 5\u20196\u201d on a good day. George is at least a foot taller than me, if not more. He\u2019s very tall. He\u2019s probably like 6\u20199\u201d. Tim Ferriss: Holy cow. Dave Elitch: Yeah, he\u2019s very tall.  Tim Ferriss: Daddy long legs on that drum kit. Dave Elitch: Yeah, long legs, long arms, long everything. So I had to rearrange his kit. A lot of times, you have to sit down and just play it, which can present some problems. But I had to rearrange things because it was impossible. An outdoor stage in Toronto. 10,000 people. You just have to go for it.  Tim Ferriss: You said you were going through a line check and then took it off the reservation. Dave Elitch: Line check is like a kick drum, snare drum, guitar. Checking that everything\u2019s working. Matty, the singer, is like, \u201cCan we do this song? Let\u2019s do this song.\u201d We did a couple of songs. Then he\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, great.\u201d Then it\u2019s showtime. Because that\u2019s the type of situation where it\u2019s a band, and you have to come in. The very difficult thing is you have to assume someone else\u2019s character and try to make everyone feel comfortable enough to where it\u2019s comfortable. They were like, \u201cPlay the parts, but you can have fun.\u201d I threw in some things here and there, and they were laughing and into it.  It was super fun. We did that run for about a month. Then I sat down with Matty, the singer and he was like, \u201cYou know, man, we have to do Glastonbury and some BB1 stuff. It\u2019s really important that this band sounds like The 1975. Right now, it sounds like The 1975 with Dave Elitch, because your personality is just huge.\u201d At the time, I was like, \u201cFuck.\u201d I was so bummed. Because I really like Matty, I really like George. All those guys. And I really like the music a lot. I was just like, \u201cFuck, man.\u201d Then I was like, \u201cWait, this is the best compliment anyone could ever give me.\u201d Because having an identity is the most important thing when you\u2019re making art.  I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s fucking awesome.\u201d They got my buddy, Freddy, who was doing it for a week until I got there, Freddy Sheed, a really great drummer in the U.K. They got him to do it again until George could come back. Freddy\u2019s great, and he\u2019s a really great buddy of mine. He did a great job. At the time, I was just so bummed.  Tim Ferriss: What helped you reframe it? When were you able to reframe it, and view it that way? Dave Elitch: It took a while. It took a few months.  Tim Ferriss: Did you do it on your own? Did it come to clarity through therapy? What helped? Because a lot of people don\u2019t recover. They\u2019re not able to reframe something that might\u2019ve been a very difficult time. It continues to be something. That was very difficult. Dave Elitch: It takes them out forever.  Tim Ferriss: Or yeah, it just becomes this pain, this dull ache that they revisit every time they have the memory. But you\u2019ve been able to reframe it. Dave Elitch: Yeah. I think through enough experience and having enough success outside of that situation. I can definitely see that happening if it\u2019s like that\u2019s your one shot, and that\u2019s the only amount of success you ever had. But I\u2019ve done a lot of other things, and I did things after that and before it. That was just that one thing. It wasn\u2019t like \u201cYou\u2019ve fucked it up,\u201d it was like, \u201cYou\u2019re too distracting.\u201d Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the shittiest music gig you\u2019ve ever had? It could be anything. It could be fucking halftime; it could be a rogue Olive Garden, I don\u2019t know.  Dave Elitch: Man, I don\u2019t know if I can answer that without getting in trouble. Tim Ferriss: Have there ever been moments when you\u2019ve doubted yourself or doubted the music path? Where you\u2019ve just been like, \u201cFuck.\u201d Dave Elitch: All the time. Tim Ferriss: Any examples come to mind? They could be super early. They could be at any point.  Dave Elitch: The industry has changed so much in the past 10 or 15 years. Just the way it\u2019s structured as a business model alone makes you question things. \u201cIs this even a working model anymore?\u201d That changes on a daily basis. Just thinking about things monetarily, sometimes, \u201cDoes this even make sense?\u201d For me, \u201cAm I going to go out on tour, and be away from home, and make X amount of money when I can just stay home and sleep in my own bed, and make X amount of money teaching?\u201d That kind of a thing. Then it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, do I want to teach, or do I want to play music?\u201d Then it\u2019s like, \u201cThe grass is always greener.\u201d  That stuff is constantly swirling around in my head. When you\u2019re auditioning for gigs, and you\u2019re like, \u201cThat guy got the gig? Are you kidding me?\u201d Then you\u2019re like, \u201cIf that\u2019s what people want, that\u2019s garbage.\u201d And everyone else is like, \u201cOh, gross. That dude\u2019s such a cheeseball. Why would they?\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cIs that what people want? If that\u2019s what people want, why am I doing this?\u201d Because no one has good taste. You can get into that whole thing. Totally. I think what\u2019s very important is doing a multitude of things. I teach a lot.  That\u2019s really my bread-and-butter. But because of that, I can be selective and learn how to say no to things because of that. So if someone calls me \u2013 Tim Ferriss: To playing gigs? Dave Elitch: Yes. If someone calls me for a tour and I heard a lot of bad things about the artist, like they\u2019re a pain in the ass, I\u2019ll be like, \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d I don\u2019t have to do it. I have a lot of friends who tour, and that\u2019s all they do.  Tim Ferriss: They have to go. Dave Elitch: They\u2019re like, \u201cGod, you\u2019re so lucky you teach. I have to go out with this piece of shit right now.\u201d Then it comes around to doing what you love for a living. What\u2019s the point if you go out on the road and you\u2019re bumming? So there\u2019s something to be said for the weekend warrior who goes to their suit-and-tie cubicle job, and then they get out of work, and they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to go play drums right now,\u201d and they\u2019re stoked. There\u2019s something to be said for that. Because it\u2019s still like a wholly special thing.  That\u2019s something that I struggle with in art because I love art so much and it\u2019s so important to me. Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cWhen are you going to start making stuff?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cBut if I start making it, then I\u2019m part of it,\u201d and then it\u2019s tainted in a way.  Tim Ferriss: It makes me think of some of my friends who are very successful travel writers. It\u2019s really hard for them to travel for fun because they\u2019re constantly thinking about, \u201cWhat would the lede be? How would I describe this? Maybe I should take some notes, just in case.\u201d They have a very tough time experiencing travel without thinking about how they would craft the narrative. Dave Elitch: Same thing for me. If you go on tour a lot, you don\u2019t want to go traveling for fun. You\u2019re like, \u201cI was just out for six weeks. I just want to be.\u201d Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cMan, you should take a vacation.\u201d I don\u2019t want to go anywhere. Tim Ferriss: I want a staycation. Dave Elitch: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: You were talking about the teaching, which I think is really a point I want to revisit because you do multiple things. You have many different interests. It strikes me that in a sense you\u2019ve, number one, diversified your identity in such a way that you don\u2019t feel psychologically compelled always to tour. Secondly, with the teaching and with the online course, Getting Out of Your Own Way, which I think could be, maybe it will be the title of this podcast, so interrelated as it relates to \u2013 this is a terrible sentence, but you get the idea \u2013 Oblique Strategies, Inner Game of Tennis. So many of these creative pursuits, professional pursuits, personal pursuits, are not about doing something brand-new that is this gigantic skill that you have to acquire over 15 years.  A lot of it is just removing the blocks. But the point I was going to make is you are not in a position, because you have developed these different branches of your life, where you have to feel or act out of desperation. It makes me think, for instance, this might seem like it\u2019s totally out of left field, but Arnold Schwarzenegger never really auditioned. This is something not a whole lot of people know about him. It\u2019s not a secret. But he made millions of dollars in real estate before he ever had his break in film. So he focused on real estate in Santa Monica and other areas and also had other types of business.  He had a mail-order business. He had a bricklaying business with Franco Columbu so that he could be selective about the roles he took.  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s incredible.  Tim Ferriss: So he was able to craft a trajectory, even when \u2013 you were talking about the cheeseball taking the gig \u2013 when he got started, people are like, \u201cThis is never going to work. You\u2019re a freak show. Nobody wants that. People want Al Pacino in Taxi.\u201d Was it Taxi or Taxi Driver? Dave Elitch: Robert De Niro? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. Wow. How many ways can I get that story wrong? Dave Elitch: We can edit that out.patience Tim Ferriss: Close enough. This is audio verit\u00e9, so I\u2019ll leave it in. Wow. You get the idea. He was able to bide his time also so that at some point he could put himself in a position where he could be exactly what people wanted. I\u2019ll give you a public thanks also for \u2013 you can see how my brain is connecting these two \u2013 for your introduction to Bill Burr, a comedian who was also on this show, who you teach. Who, for people who haven\u2019t seen it, does one of the most hilarious Arnold Schwarzenegger bits of all time, which I won\u2019t spoil. It is definitely not suitable for work, so don\u2019t play it at full volume on YouTube at your job and then get pissed off at me on the internet. But the diversification of identity psychologically is very important. Then the income diversification for you, allowing you to then as an artist craft a more deliberate path, I think is really important. Dave Elitch: Absolutely. And if you\u2019re not being deliberate about what you\u2019re creating, then what the hell are you doing? You\u2019re just making garbage, right? Tim Ferriss: Absolutely. You mentioned George. This is George Daniel, right?  Dave Elitch: Yup. Tim Ferriss: The 1975. He has said, and I quote, \u201cAmong other things,\u201d I\u2019ll read the whole thing, \u201cDave saved my arms and hands. He made me see I could, in fact, contrary to my belief, develop a technique that would save me from blisters and helped solve tendinitis from many years of horribly inefficient technique.\u201d We don\u2019t have to talk about that. We can, but the next line is what\u2019s interesting to me. \u201cHe taught patience! An incredible player, a really great teacher, and all-around lovely human.\u201d What does that mean by \u201cHe taught patience?\u201d Dave Elitch: I think probably, as long as someone is putting the work in, I\u2019m very patient with people, because seeing the light flash in their eyes when something clicks is one of the greatest feelings imaginable. Also, probably for him, I think to be patient with himself. Taking the time to really hone in on certain things and not having to rush through things. Just feeling like, \u201cI\u2019m going to put the work in and I\u2019m going to take the time so all this stuff happens the way it should happen.\u201d You have to be patient with that or else it\u2019s never going to manifest itself.  Tim Ferriss: Or with something that\u2019s as physical as drumming, if you rush it and your technique is not biomechanically suitable for a human body, then \u2013 Dave Elitch: That\u2019s what I was saying earlier. It\u2019s inherently an issue of the drum set as an instrument in that the way the drum set was formed initially around the turn of the century, it was called a trap kit, short for \u201ccontraption.\u201d So you think of these dudes around the late 1800s, 1900s, taking disparate concert percussion instruments like a bass drum by itself and a snare drum. Then they had to make a pedal to use the bass drum. And the high hats were originally called low boys because they were on the floor and you only played them with your foot.  It\u2019s evolved in this really bizarre, strange way, so it\u2019s physically strange. But also the bar is incredibly low in terms of entry. It\u2019s very easy to play drums in the beginning. You sit down and go [sound effects], and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I can play drums. I can play along to AC/DC and Michael Jackson. This is great.\u201d No one thinks about how anything functions because they can already do it. Then they go out tour and 10 years later, they\u2019re like, \u201cMy arms are destroyed,\u201d or \u201cMy hip,\u201d or \u201cMy back.\u201d Because they\u2019re doing everything inefficiently or incorrectly.  Then also they get stuck as far as the vocabulary goes because they can\u2019t express themselves properly because they\u2019re in their own way. A lot of it is inherently part of the instrument itself. I always use violin as an example. You have to sit there for six months just getting your intonation happening. Or with saxophone, you have to get your embouchure together.  Tim Ferriss: Your what? Dave Elitch: Embouchure.  Tim Ferriss: Embouchure. What is that? Dave Elitch: It\u2019s basically throat control. How you produce air pressure. That takes a while. You start learning the clarinet. You\u2019re squawking all over the place. You have to develop that control. You can\u2019t just sit down and make a sound. There\u2019s a certain amount of gestation. Tim Ferriss: With the drums, you can get the reward without having to develop that body control.  Dave Elitch: Immediately. Exactly. That\u2019s the problem. But that\u2019s part of the instrument. What I was going to say earlier when we were talking about being able to wear many different hats, do many different things, but be deliberate about what you\u2019re doing, I was talking to a friend about this. He was like, \u201cYeah, if your identity is largely based on what you do for a living, whatever it is, what if you wake up one day and you don\u2019t want to do that thing? Then you\u2019re like, \u2018Who am I?\u2019 That\u2019s a mind-fuck.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Very common. Super, super common. For people who try to retire and then they\u2019re like, \u201cWait, I\u2019ve spent 12 hours a day for the last 30 years doing X.\u201d  Dave Elitch: Then you have a whole other black hole where if you\u2019re a very important person and you get a lot of respect, and then you retire, you\u2019re just some guy. That\u2019s a whole other thing to deal with. Then what are you going to do with your life when you just wake up? Are you going to play golf? All that? Then that\u2019s a whole other thing. Tim Ferriss: What would you put on a billboard, if you could put \u2013 metaphorically, right? A message, a few words, a word. Anything. A billboard to get out to million of people. He\u2019s holding his t-shirt. Slow down? Dave Elitch: Yeah. Slow down. Because generally speaking, so many people need to do that. Slow down, take a deep breath, just relax. Tim Ferriss: You can also cover up or hide a lot of your own mistakes and sloppiness from yourself by doing things too quickly. Dave Elitch: Absolutely. That\u2019s very common in music. Tim Ferriss: Yes, very common in music. It\u2019s very common in a lot of things. When I watch really good boxing instructors, they\u2019re always like, \u201cSlow down.\u201d In the beginning, certainly. Anybody can flail their arms around so nobody can see what you\u2019re doing exactly. I want to see exactly what you\u2019re doing, really slowly in the beginning. It also brings to mind one of my favorite expressions I\u2019ve learned in the last few years, which is from a friend of mine who is a former Navy SEAL. It\u2019s not specific to him. It\u2019s something that you hear quite a lot. It is \u201cSlow is smooth and smooth is fast.\u201d  Dave Elitch: Yes, I like that. Tim Ferriss: Do not rush. Because if you try to rush a reload or rush whatever it might be and you botch it, now you\u2019re really slow. Dave Elitch: You\u2019re slower than you would even be before.  Tim Ferriss: Yes.  Dave Elitch: It\u2019s the same with the weights and shit in the smaller circles. You have to learn things in large movements or whatever you want to think about this is, whatever paradigm you want to think about this in, and then as you get more comfortable with it, it gets smaller and smaller and smaller. Then you\u2019re just throwing someone across the room.  Tim Ferriss: For those people wondering, that\u2019s Josh Waitzkin who is a fantastic guy, a good friend of mine, who is the basis for the book and the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. He\u2019s really a master in many disciplines. That\u2019s one of his concepts, for sure.  Dave Elitch: I tell everyone I teach to get that book.  Tim Ferriss: The Art of Learning is a fantastic book. He was the second ever guest on this podcast. A lot of great concepts. Also for people interested, I did a television episode with him where we looked at Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which he\u2019s a black belt in, among other things. That was the first time for that TV show that he got in front of a chess board in, I want to say 15 years, something like that. His wife said: \u201cI cannot believe that he\u2019s getting in front of a chess board. I\u2019ve maybe never seen him do it.\u201d  Dave Elitch: That thing in the episode where he talks about playing like 50 chess games at the same time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, the simultaneous games. Dave Elitch: Yeah, and talking about feeling the flow of energy in the room and then he felt like a shift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. He felt like he had been juggling 30 balls and one of them got dropped. He was playing, it was something like 30 kids, and one of them cheated. And he came back around, and he didn\u2019t know exactly what had happened, but he was like, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d  Dave Elitch: That sounds spooky. That\u2019s a real thing. That episode was so affirming and exciting for me because he said a lot of things where I was like, \u201cI am doing this right. I am on the right path.\u201d Because there were so many things that we did similarly. Tim Ferriss: The transfer is so clear. Dave Elitch: Huge. Tim Ferriss: Which is part of the fun. It\u2019s a big part of the fun of having this podcast for me is interviewing people across disciplines that at first glance you would expect to have nothing to do with one another, and you just realize that people who are playing their A game in any field have more in common with one another than they do with the B players in their own field.  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s one of my favorite things to do with Burr. We sit down and talk about comedy and drumming and the massive amounts of overlap between the two. When we first started working together, he had basically like a John Bonham, Led Zeppelin, almost like a replica kit. He\u2019s a huge Bonham fan. Everyone who plays drums is a John Bonham fan. He\u2019s incredible. He has a very specific sound. So he got this early \u201870s, green sparkle Ludwig kit. Giant 26\u201d bass drum. It\u2019s a thing. It\u2019s a very specific thing. We\u2019re working together, and we\u2019re talking about identity and what he wants to say and who he wants to be and getting his posture together.  I was like, \u201cDude, you wouldn\u2019t walk out on stage and start yelling like Sam Kinison. That\u2019s his thing. You do your own thing. You walk out on stage in front of whatever, 12,000 people at Madison Square Garden. You\u2019re doing your own thing. Bring that to this.\u201d He sold the kit immediately. Got his own thing. He\u2019s figuring out what his own thing is. That\u2019s so much fun for me to do. He\u2019s one of the smartest dudes I know. He\u2019s brilliant. Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s a very smart guy. Within any field, you have certain philosophical underpinnings or paradigms that people choose as the foundation for a lot of their decisions and career paths and so on. Then you have the strategies, and you have the tactics. The lower level you go in some respects, the more the fields diverge, but certainly at the higher levels, whether it\u2019s tennis, comedy, drumming, or otherwise, there are so many commonalities. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? Dave Elitch: That I love? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll give you an example. Or a compulsion. So for instance, Cheryl Strayed, who wrote the book, Wild. She\u2019s an excellent author and a fantastic podcast host. The example she gave is she likes to reassemble sandwiches. So when she gets a sandwich, it bothers her if all the tomatoes are on one side of the sandwich and the avocado is on the other. She wants every bite to be as uniform as possible. So she reassembles her sandwich. I like the number 555 because I finished editing the final line on the final pass of The 4-Hour Body in a samovar tea shop in San Francisco ages ago and looked up and it was 5:55 p.m. So that became this good luck charm. So I take screenshots of that whenever it pops up. It could be anything.  Dave Elitch: \u00a0 It\u2019s funny. I think to be good at anything, you need to have a touch of OCD, absolutely. You have to be detail oriented. I do have those things, but I can\u2019t think of anything off the top of my head, other than checking the stove 10 times when I\u2019m leaving the house. Checking my studio door four times to make sure it\u2019s locked. I can\u2019t think of anything weirdly specific like that at the moment.  Tim Ferriss: No problem. I\u2019m sure there are depths to plumb there that we can return to. How often do you eat Indian or Himalayan food with some type of curry-type consistency? Dave Elitch: Every day, pretty much. That\u2019s why I go to the gym six days a week, because I have to work off all the clarified butter.  Tim Ferriss: All right. I\u2019ll leave that. That may qualify. When you feel \u2013 actually, I\u2019m not going to ask that one. Let me go somewhere else. One thing that\u2019s come up in our conversations recently because I\u2019ve never worked with a therapist, and I\u2019ve listened to interviews you\u2019ve done where you\u2019ve mentioned therapy and your therapist. I\u2019ve always had a certain degree of resistance, particularly to talk therapy, for a lot of reasons I won\u2019t bore everybody with. I\u2019d like to talk about that because it seems like you\u2019ve benefited tremendously from it. If you\u2019re comfortable talking about it, why did you end up engaging a therapist? How did you choose your therapist? What have been some of the benefits that you\u2019ve derived from it so far? Dave Elitch: I initially \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Sorry. I\u2019ll continue to step all over your answers. You, as well as a few other people, when I have mentioned that I have not worked with a therapist, they\u2019re just like, \u201cWhat in the fuck? Are you serious?\u201d  Dave Elitch: Especially you. Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re like, \u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, maybe this is something I should explore.\u201d Dave Elitch: Yeah, absolutely.  Tim Ferriss: This has come up multiple times from multiple people. Your story. Dave Elitch: I started seeing a therapist around when I was 30-ish. Something like that. It was mainly to figure out relationship issues that kept happening over and over and over again. I was like, \u201cThere\u2019s clearly something here that\u2019s a blind spot to me, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing; I need to figure this out.\u201d That was the specific reason why I started going. I found my therapist through a really close friend of mine who is a therapist. We obviously can\u2019t work together because she\u2019s a close friend of mine. She was like, \u201cYou should see this person; she\u2019s incredible.\u201d  Working with a therapist, having a good relationship with someone where you can really trust them, and you care about each other, it clicks. That is unbelievably important. There are so many bad drum teachers out there, and there are so many bad therapists out there. It can be extremely damaging to someone. Having a good therapist who you get along with and connect with and who\u2019s very competent, that\u2019s why I picked someone \u2013 I mean, we hit it off, and it was obvious. But she\u2019s 80. All these life coaches running around who are like 25. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat the fuck do you know? You don\u2019t know anything.\u201d  Having a therapist where I can bring up anything and she\u2019s like, \u201cYup, been there.\u201d That\u2019s huge. It started off with the relationship stuff, and then it obviously shoots off into all these other different directions. Even having someone to go in and dump on and brain vomit, who\u2019s only there to help you out, help you sort things out, the world would be a completely different place if everyone had that. Had a safe \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Like an outlet. Dave Elitch: Yeah, to just unload. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the ingredients for success in the beginning? Would you say that it was important for you to meet every week for a certain period of time? Given how much you potentially travel, right? What were some of the things that made it work? Dave Elitch: It\u2019s the same thing with drumming. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey look, if you\u2019re serious about this, we\u2019ve got to do this once a week,\u201d because it\u2019s like going to the gym. You don\u2019t go two days a week for four hours. You go every day for an hour or something. You have consistency. That\u2019s crucial. You\u2019re able to make progress because it\u2019s a recurring dialogue you\u2019re having with someone. I went once a week for years. When things got particularly messy, I would sometimes go twice a week. There were times when she really saved my life. Dealing with PTSD, you literally feel like you\u2019re going to die.  Now I go once a month to sort of check in. What\u2019s funny, we were talking about this last night, the times when I\u2019m like, \u201cEverything\u2019s kind of cool; I don\u2019t even need to go today.\u201d Those are the times when you stumble into some massive paradigm shift. It literally is a paradigm shift. You see the world in a completely different way. A lot of the times when that happens, it\u2019s funny. I\u2019ll be talking out loud, thinking, but verbalizing it and you sort of get on a path and then you\u2019re like, \u201cBoom,\u201d and something happens. You\u2019re just like, \u201cHoly shit, where did that come from?\u201d It\u2019s almost like an out-of-body experience.  A lot of it is trying to get outside of yourself, which is extremely difficult. Thinking about \u201cIs this aspect of my personality \u2013 is this learned from my parents or someone else, or is this part of me?\u201d A lot of things that I didn\u2019t know I was even doing are learned things that can be unlearned. It might take a lot of work. It takes a lot of work. It\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But I am a completely different person. A very specific example that\u2019s something small, if I\u2019m at the gym and someone reracks their weights improperly, it drives me fucking bananas. It drives me crazy. If they take the 25s \u2013 Tim Ferriss: And put it on the 35s? Dave Elitch: Oh, my God. It drives me crazy. It\u2019s like this could not be more black and white. How is that acceptable? And then that fucks up the flow for everyone else. One day, she was like, \u201cWell, you know, they didn\u2019t see that you were wearing your invisible police uniform. They just didn\u2019t see it.\u201d I start laughing, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God, you\u2019re totally right.\u201d The feeling, this need to police everyone. It\u2019s obviously a need for control, which is a learned thing. That\u2019s something that I constantly have to check myself about. That\u2019ll take you out because there are so many things like that on the daily.  Tim Ferriss: Hundreds, thousands, right? Dave Elitch: Yeah, and they\u2019re everywhere.  Tim Ferriss: Why does this guy not know how to use this chip reader? Dave Elitch: Yeah, or like, \u201cWhy did you park like an asshole?\u201d It\u2019s mostly people being inconsiderate that drives me crazy. Tim Ferriss: I have one friend, and I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d want to be named explicitly, so I won\u2019t mention his name. He\u2019s a very brilliant guy in his field. When he goes through TSA and airport security, it drives him completely fucking bananas when people don\u2019t know how to go through security. They\u2019ll leave their belt on, or they\u2019ll have a huge container of water after the person has asked them four times if they have any liquids. What he started to do \u2013 he\u2019s also been very recently seeing a therapist and has figured out certain coping mechanisms.  One of his coping mechanisms, which I think is really hilarious, is he will become the voice that he imagines they have. They\u2019re 30 feet away. He\u2019ll go, \u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t take water on the airplane? Last time I was here, I could bring my computer through the metal detector.\u201d And he\u2019ll do this. I remember asking him at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s really funny. That\u2019s what you say to yourself?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s what I say out loud. I say it loud enough so that everybody around me can hear it and people start laughing and chill the fuck out.\u201d  Dave Elitch: Oh, it\u2019s a way to defuse it?  Tim Ferriss: I think he did it initially because he thought it was hilarious and uncomfortable to say it out loud, but now he\u2019s become the standup comedian at the back of the line. I now know at least a half dozen people who have spent time with him who now do the same thing in line.  Dave Elitch: That\u2019s hilarious. Tim Ferriss: But it\u2019s the little things that are the big things, right? Dave Elitch: It\u2019s also why would \u2013 it\u2019s also for, like, TSA employees driving you bananas. I travel a lot and a lot of them are totally incompetent. It\u2019s like going to anything where you have to deal with someone in that type of a job. You go, \u201cWait, why would this person be competent? A competent person wouldn\u2019t have this job in the first place, so why am I expecting that to begin with?\u201d I\u2019m setting myself up to get angry.  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s the small things. We think about these big, existential dilemmas and questions, but in so many cases \u2013 that stuff is important or can be important \u2013 but it\u2019s also are you giving yourself 100 pats on the back in your day or are you giving yourself 100 papercuts? Because you have ample opportunity for both.  Dave Elitch: What we\u2019re talking about might sound trivial, but you stack all of those things up, and they\u2019ll take you out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, for sure. Oh, my God. We will, at some point, maybe tonight over some wine, come back to more unusual and absurd things that you love because I am sure there is a treasure trove. One or two last questions. You\u2019ve mentioned a few books here that you gifted to me, which are very timely. Are there any other particular gifts that you\u2019ve given the most as gifts to other people? Dave Elitch: The Andre Agassi book, Open, is phenomenal.  Tim Ferriss: An incredible book. Even if you don\u2019t care about tennis at all, it is an incredible book. Dave Elitch: I tweeted years ago, I was like, \u201cHey, does anyone know any sports psychology books directly related to tennis or golf?\u201d Because I was really fascinated by those. I don\u2019t really give a shit about sports, really. But I was really fascinated because the psychological warfare you have to navigate by yourself is the same as when the red light\u2019s on in the studio. I have to do these film scores where you have to sight-read everything. You\u2019ve never seen it before. They throw up a book.  Tim Ferriss: Sight reading is you\u2019ve never played it? Dave Elitch: You\u2019ve never seen the music before. They throw up the sheet music, and you have to play it perfectly the first time because you have to do the whole movie in a day.  Tim Ferriss: Jesus. Dave Elitch: So it\u2019s very stressful. Tim Ferriss: Including films like Trolls, The Book of Love. Others? Dave Elitch: Logan, that Wolverine movie.  Tim Ferriss: Oh, so good.  Dave Elitch: That St. Vincent movie with Bill Murray a few years ago. All the Divergent, Insurgent. Tim Ferriss: But like same, same, but different. In terms of the sports, the tennis, the golf.  Dave Elitch: Like when you hit the ball in the sand, and you\u2019re like, \u201cFuck.\u201d Then you have to leave it be. You can\u2019t let that ruin the whole game. The same sort of thing. When the red light\u2019s on in the studio, or you\u2019re playing in front of 30,000 people, it\u2019s the same thing. If you screw something up, you can\u2019t be \u201cLight, ugh,\u201d and let it screw up the whole show. It\u2019s the same exact thing. I thought that was fascinating. Tim Ferriss: So was the Agassi book recommended as a result of that post that you put up? Dave Elitch: Yeah. I was like, \u201cOh, my God, this is incredible.\u201d Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a tremendous book. Dave Elitch: I give that to people all the time. The Art of Learning I give to people all the time. Tim Ferriss: Josh Waitzkin. Dave Elitch: Yup. I give The Inner Game of Tennis. I give Zen in the Art of Archery to people all the time. I feel like that was the very first book that spawned all of these Zen and the art of \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Fill-in-the-blank. Yeah, definitely.  Dave Elitch: Yes. So popular now. God, I need to look at my bookcase. There\u2019s so many. Tim Ferriss: Horton Hears a Who! Last but not least.  Dave Elitch: So many. Tim Ferriss: You are one of the best-read people I\u2019ve met in the last I would say five years, which is saying a lot because I meet a lot of people who read very widely.  Dave Elitch: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: This has been so much fun. We could go on for many, many more hours, so maybe we\u2019ll do that at some point. Where are some of the best places for people to find you? We talked about daveelitch.com, Instagram, Twitter @daveelitch. There are other social profiles, I\u2019m sure, but it seems like maybe those are the best. The online course, which is really stunningly shot and very well done, Getting Out of Your Own Way, that\u2019s available at daveelitch.com? Dave Elitch: \u00a0 Daveelitch.com, yeah.  Tim Ferriss: Any other places where people can find you that you\u2019d like them to pay attention to or any other recommendations or asks of the audience, people who are listening?  Dave Elitch: Well, the easiest place to find me is Instagram. Just Dave Elitch. Or my website. You can contact me through my website. I\u2019m not super active on Twitter or Facebook anymore. Someone else who wrote a lot of books I recommend are Douglas Coupland. He wrote Generation X.  Tim Ferriss: Coupland, that\u2019s C-O-U-P-L-A-N-D. Dave Elitch: He\u2019s also an equally amazing visual artist, which is incredibly rare. I find a ton of inspiration from him. He\u2019s great. I recommend a lot of his books. Generation X is great social commentary from the early \u201890s. Tim Ferriss: He coined that term \u201cGeneration X.\u201d Dave Elitch: Yeah. He\u2019s an interesting sort of social tech theorist. I think he has a job at Google now. Tim Ferriss: He very well could. They tend to gather interesting, eclectic folks. Dave Elitch: Yeah, he\u2019s an interesting dude. So yeah. Those are the two best places to contact me, my website or Instagram. If anyone hears this and they\u2019re sort of kindred spirits in terms of what motivates us or in terms of any sort of creative endeavor, reach out and say \u201cHey.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Lob out a note or a hand wave through the ether that is the interwebs. Dave, it\u2019s so awesome to finally get you on.  Dave Elitch: Same, dude. Tim Ferriss: Many, many adventures ahead. I\u2019m excited for you. I\u2019m hoping to pop into the master class tomorrow, which I will be completely unqualified for. Nonetheless, as a fly on the wall.  Dave Elitch: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: I really look forward to that. Before I forget, Daughters of Mara. Is Mara, I\u2019ve never thought to ask this, but is that a reference to the, what is it, Hindu god? Dave Elitch: I think it\u2019s Buddhist. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s Buddhist. Mara, who\u2019s sort of the equivalent of \u2013 Dave Elitch: The Devil. Tim Ferriss: The Devil. Dave Elitch: Yeah, he had three daughters that would tempt people. Sort of like the snake in the Garden of Eden equivalent. Tim Ferriss: Daughters of Mara. Dave Elitch: That was a band I was in in 2005-2007 that was on Virgin, Capitol Records, did a record, and then EMI got bought out by Terra Firma, and that was that. Tim Ferriss: I am Destroyer, appropriate.  Dave Elitch: Yeah, very relevant. Little did we know. Tim Ferriss: Dave smash! All right. Everybody listening, as always, you can find links to all the things we talked about, including the crazy Mars Volta video. We will also look up a few other things, like the books that, in addition to the Pia Mellody book, the other books, perhaps some of the books your therapist has on her mantle, and the mankind existential animal quote question mark, etc. will all be in the show notes.  You can also find links certainly to Getting Out of Your Own Way and everything linked to Dave at tim.blog/podcast. Until next time, thank you for listening.

that you\u2019re wearing right now", "it\u2019s a t-shirt that i liked so much at one point when we hung out in l.a", "and smashed on some drums and then ate a bunch of himalayan yak if i remember correctly, i asked you where i could get one of these shirts", "so could you describe for people what you\u2019re wearing at the moment and why", " dave elitch: absolutely", "i\u2019m wearing one of

your body is doing", "so all these people try to rush through something, and they physiologically have no idea what\u2019s going on", "\u201cdo it again\u201d because of the sheer amount of repetition you have to do to plug in that muscle memory", "it\u2019s fun", "i made it just as a joke kind of, you know", " and then people would come up to me on the street and be like, \u201coh, i love that shirt,\u201d because people get whatever sort of meaning they want", "tim ferriss: it\u2019s the rorschach inkblot test", " dave elitch: absolutely", "people love it, and they get whatever they want out of it", "it could mean all sorts of different things", " tim ferriss: this also i think highlights for me a difference between, a critical difference in learning anything, or several critical differences", "one is developing a skill versus demonstrating the skill", "you could apply that to say, strength", "it\u2019s development versus display; competing in powerlifting versus training for powerlifting", "in this case, i think maybe a good contrast that comes to mind would be last night, sitting down at this electronic drum kit, my first kit of that type that i\u2019ve ever used, and playing with the basic posture and body mechanics", "so you would ask me to relinquish control of my arm and provide deadweight and to do the same with my leg, to try to ensure that, for instance, when using the \u2013 i never know if i should call it a kick or bass or something else", " dave elitch: same thing", "tim ferriss: kick or bass drum or pedal, rather, that i would be using my hip as opposed to getting wicket-whack with my ankle or other articulation", "in aiming to do that, ensuring that i\u2019m not leaning back like i\u2019m in an easy rider because that creates all sorts of instability", "it was incredible to me, but not surprising given my time with you, that within about 120 seconds, you took one of my greatest sources of discomfort sitting at any kit, which was feeling like i had to be balanced on my left ass cheek to make the bass pedal work properly, and you removed that, so now i could have a little bit of anterior pelvic tilt", "and for people wondering what that means, imagine your hips are a glass of wine", "if you pour wine out the front, that\u2019s anterior pelvic tilt", "posterior pelvic tilt would be pouring wine out the back", "and so having a little bit of tilt forward so that i can fit my sit bones on the stool, which you also helped me to do by taking a weight plate \u2013 this was in the garage, and the gym is also there \u2013 and putting it on top of it", "so you diagnosed that very quickly", "and then we practiced a very slow, basic, sort of ac/dc rock beat", "dave elitch: money beat", " tim ferriss: in doing that, we were able to focus on some fundamental grips and so on in a very slow fashion", "but the video that introduced you to me has a number, it turns out, of stories associated with it that i hadn\u2019t heard", "it seems like a lot of people have come to find you through this video", "so i\u2019d love to tell people about it", "i think it came about because i was on twitter at god knows what unholy hour and was thinking about drumming", "i\u2019ve always been fascinated by drumming", "so i asked something along the lines of \u201cwho is a beast drummer who is also a good drummer?\u201d and somebody threw a link up to this video", "what is the video", " dave elitch: the video is me playing with the mars volta at a big day out festival in sydney, australia in 2010, early 2010", "i would videotape all of the shows that we played", "i\u2019d set up a little camera behind me", "because when you\u2019re in the heat of battle, as you could say, you have no idea how it\u2019s actually coming across", "if i backtrack a little bit, with this situation and a lot of situations that i get called for, i\u2019ve sort of developed this reputation as a bit of a mercenary in that like when someone breaks their arm or someone gets fired, or someone needs someone to do a tour like last minute, with no rehearsal, little rehearsal, whatever, they call me and i have to learn everything last minute", "it\u2019s funny", "i\u2019ve been \u2013 tim ferriss: the cleaner", " dave elitch: yeah, exactly", "so with the mars volta, with miley cyrus, with 1975, with m83, you walk into a room", "you go, \u201cnice to meet you guys.\u201d you might run through the set once, and then you\u2019re playing in front of 15,000-30,000 people", "it\u2019s a unique situation to be in", "the amount of pressure is unbelievable", "because as a drummer, if you drop the ball, the whole show collapses in on top of you", "it\u2019s not like the guitar, where you can go, whoops, flubbed that, and then you can just kind of keep playing", " tim ferriss: do it twice, and you\u2019re playing jazz", " dave elitch: yes, exactly", "drumming, if you drop the ball, the whole show caves in on you", "so the mars volta was the first big situation that i was in like that", "i got that gig when i was 25", "they called hundreds of people to do it", "people were sending in video auditions and all kinds of stuff", "when they asked me to do it, i said, \u201cyeah, sure.\u201d in your head, it\u2019s one of those \u2013 i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had this experience before \u2013 they\u2019re like, \u201cgreat, this sounds great.\u201d in my head, i\u2019m like, \u201cno, no, no, no, no,\u201d and then i was just like, \u201cyes.\u201d yes just comes out of your mouth", "i feel like every important life decision i\u2019ve ever made, that happens, and it\u2019s super important just to do it", " tim ferriss: grow wings on the way down", "dave elitch: yes, exactly", "so i flew to europe, met the band, we ran through the two and a half hour set twice, and then went on tour", "this is for people who aren\u2019t familiar with the band, it\u2019s extremely complex music", "lots of \u2013 omar the guitar player, lots of hand signals and eyebrows, cues", " tim ferriss: i didn\u2019t realize that", "so he\u2019s like a major league baseball catcher", " dave elitch: yeah, yeah, yeah", "there\u2019s a long drum solo every night", "you have to be on point, really", "so i would set up a camera behind me every night to be like, \u201ci need to know what this actually sounds like.\u201d because in the heat of the moment, you could think you\u2019re killing it, and then you watch a video, and you\u2019re like, \u201cugh, whoops.\u201d or the opposite is also true always", "i could be like, \u201ci feel like that didn\u2019t sound good at all,\u201d and then i watch the video, and i\u2019m like, \u201coh, that was actually okay.\u201d that level of cognitive disconnect in that scenario is huge", " i would go back to my hotel room after the show, and watch the video and take mental notes about things that worked and things that didn\u2019t work", "for me, it\u2019s always been very important to put on a visual show", "there\u2019s nothing worse than going to see a show and just watching someone that looks like they\u2019re doing their taxes", " tim ferriss: why do you think this particular video \u2013 and we\u2019ll put it in the show notes for people who want to see it, you can go to tim.blog/podcast, and it\u2019ll be right in the show notes so you can find the link", "but if people wanted to google this, is there anything, in particular, they should search for", "dave elitch: you could type in \u201cdave elitch drum cam\u201d or just \u201cdave elitch,\u201d and it\u2019s going to pop up at the top somewhere", " tim ferriss: it\u2019s one of the very first results", "why do you think this video \u2013 and this is related to where you were going, i think \u2013 why do you think this video caught on in the way that it did", "dave elitch: because i\u2019m going apeshit", "tim ferriss: fucking berserk", " dave elitch: i was standing up, kicking stuff over", "like, just going nuts", "i think it\u2019s really important to put on a show, so people are like, \u201choly shit", "what is going on", "this is insane.\u201d so yeah, i\u2019m standing up and hitting super hard", "it\u2019s visually entertaining", "but the most important part of that is the playing has to be happening", "if you go nuts, and then you screw something up, there\u2019s a point", "so the playing has to be on point, and then i\u2019m going to stand up and kick something over, you know", " tim ferriss: before you had your first, whether it\u2019s your first performance with the mars volta, so you\u2019ve gone through the set twice", "you\u2019re in europe", "or wherever you are in the world", "what is your self-talk or your prep before going out on stage to play with this band", "dave elitch: you\u2019ll be into this because there\u2019s a lot of note-taking", " tim ferriss: i\u2019m already into it", "dave elitch: this is something that i do with a lot of people that i work with", "just showing them how to chart out a song properly because so many people write out way too much nonsense and then it\u2019s way too much to navigate", "learning music at the last minute and having to play it, that does happen quite a bit, whether it\u2019s like a coffee house or a huge show or whatever", "so most people will write out everything, and then they go to look at it, and they have no idea", "they can\u2019t read their handwriting", "meaning what i do with people is it\u2019s just the roadmap", "you\u2019re not writing out notation", "it\u2019s just like intro \u2013 eight bars; verse \u2013 16 bars; chorus \u2013 16", "it\u2019s just that", " that\u2019s it", "i might say where my right hand is", "right cymbal, crash, high hat", "but it\u2019s very minimalistic", "so i made those charts for all the songs", "i would go through \u2013 it\u2019s all about how you approach this stuff, right", "a lot of people would go, \u201ci\u2019m going to play through this setlist,\u201d just bang, bang, bang, down the line", "but you\u2019re constantly distracted", "you\u2019re constantly switching", "the target\u2019s moving", "so you can\u2019t get deep", "tim ferriss: why is the target moving", "dave elitch: because you\u2019re switching songs all the time", "what i would do is i would take the first song in the setlist, and i would have my notes and the music, and i would play through it as many times as it took for me to be like, \u201ci know this really well.\u201d but the same thing on repeat", "most people would be like, \u201ci\u2019m just going to go through the set and then it\u2019s like \u2013\u201d tim ferriss: by the songs changing, you mean that show to show", "dave elitch: no, i mean within the setlist itself", "so like someone would play the first song and then the second song and then the third song all in a row", "then they can\u2019t remember anything because they\u2019re working on all the songs at the same time", " tim ferriss: it\u2019s linear", "dave elitch: yes, exactly", "tim ferriss: it\u2019s also \u2013 just because we\u2019ve both had a fair amount of caffeine, so i feel like we can make use of that caffeine now \u2013 this is also a reason why certain mnemonic devices work better than others", "for instance, if you use what sometimes is referred to as a memory palace, this has been used for thousands of years", "cicero used it for memorizing speeches, among other things, where you could take \u2013 this is also how a lot of memory competitors memorize shuffled decks of cards, is they will memorize pairs of cards as interacting images and place them along a familiar route", "so walking from their front door to the grocery store or something like that", " but one of the challenges with that is if you want to get to the 12th item and recall that 12th item, you have to run through the list", "similarly, if you\u2019re only memorizing or getting familiar with a playlist or a set from one to 12 or whatever the number is, and then all of a sudden i\u2019m just like imagining the lead singer\u2019s like, \u201cfuck it", "i feel we should just go to five.\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201ci\u2019m not ready for five.\u201d  dave elitch: totally", "that\u2019s a very real thing", "and that\u2019s a real thing also when people are doing method book work like out of a drum book, let\u2019s say", "i might have them learn the entire page; this happens all the time", "i\u2019m like, \u201ccool", "let me hear you start from the end.\u201d they\u2019re like, \u201cuh\u2026\u201d so that is a very important point, and that comes later in the process, at the end of the process", "so i will go through one song over and over and over again until i know it really well; this is huge; practicing not in regards to time, but in regards to goals", " so the number of people who go to music school and they go, \u201cyeah, i practice eight hours a day.\u201d it\u2019s not about how much time", "it\u2019s about what you\u2019re getting done", "and having specific goals", "and writing that down and go, \u201ci need to get this from here to here", "once i get that done, i\u2019m done", "check", "moving on.\u201d a lot of people go, \u201ci need to work on this thing for an hour.\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean anything", "it\u2019s not a tangible goal", "an hour for you and an hour for me are completely different", "one person could get it in 20 minutes", "another person could take two hours", "it\u2019s unbelievable how everyone structures things in terms of time", " tim ferriss: how do you know when you have a song", " dave elitch: that\u2019s a good question", "i don\u2019t know if i can put that into words", "tim ferriss: what does it feel like", "dave elitch: it feels like \u2013 you\u2019ve given a lot of talks", "you rehearse it enough, and you\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, i don\u2019t need these notes.\u201d you know it in your core", "it\u2019s like when you memorize your times tables or whatever", "it\u2019s that same type of thing", "you don\u2019t have to gear up to get it going", " tim ferriss: someone could slap you in the face to wake you up and be like, \u201cdo this,\u201d and it would come out", "dave elitch: it\u2019s in your bones", "i prepare in that regard like an insane amount", "it\u2019s like a ridiculous amount", "so i\u2019ll play the song; i don\u2019t know, like five or 10 times with my notes", "and then i start, \u201cokay, i think i got it now.\u201d then i\u2019ll put my notes away and just play", "no, sorry", "then i\u2019ll play with just the notes, no music", "then i\u2019ll play \u2013 tim ferriss: as you were saying", "so you\u2019re accompanying the music first with your notes", " dave elitch: yes", "and then when i get comfortable the next step \u2013 tim ferriss: turn off the music", "dave elitch: \u2013 and just play with the notes", "and then the next step is music, no notes", "and then the final step is just a click track, nothing else", "so just a click track", " tim ferriss: click track metronome", "dave elitch: yeah", "so i hear nothing, and i have to know it so well that i can get through the whole song in my head, hearing everything", "that\u2019s an insane amount of work", "but the deal is when you get on stage, and there are 30,000 people screaming, and like with miley, people throwing bras and underwear at me", " tim ferriss: better than batteries and tomatoes, i guess", "or beer bottles", " dave elitch: like at that moment, you have to know everything so well that that\u2019s not going to faze you", "it takes a long time", "i\u2019m in there for 10 or 12 hours at the beginning", "but that type of preparation is huge", "what\u2019s funny is when i went to amsterdam to rehearse the set with them, i set up an extra floor tom on my left side, which you normally wouldn\u2019t do that; they\u2019re on your right side", "were you going to say something", "tim ferriss: no, no, no", "i was going to say maybe you could explain what a floor tom is for people who don\u2019t know", "dave elitch: yeah", "so tom\u2019s, yeah, interesting explaining this", "man, how would you explain this to a layman", "tim ferriss: it\u2019s tough", "i\u2019m going to do a poor job", "dave elitch: yeah, great", "tim ferriss: i will do a terrible job, but it\u2019s easy for me to come at this with beginner\u2019s ideas because i don\u2019t know what the fuck i\u2019m talking about", "if people can hear the snap, like the, generally \u2013 please feel free to call bullshit on any of this", " dave elitch: no, no, you\u2019re good", "tim ferriss: like that, you\u2019re going to be hearing say a snare drum, right", "dave elitch: mm-hmm", "tim ferriss: when you look at drummers, and they have their hands seemingly crossed, they\u2019re hitting the high hat, and then they\u2019re hitting the snare with the other hand", "that\u2019s part of the lifeblood of any kind of rock beat, right", "dave elitch: and the kick drum with their foot", "tim ferriss: so it\u2019s like [sound effects], that is the high hat and the snare", "then if you were to hear a drummer say travel left to right, assuming they\u2019re right-handed, like [sound effects], when you hear [sound effects] that part is very often going to be a floor tom", " dave elitch: perfect", "perfect", "i couldn\u2019t have done that better myself", "tim ferriss: so you are right-handed", "dave elitch: yes", "so you have a rack tom up top, straight in front of you, which is going to be the higher pitch, like [sound effects] and then you go down further, and you get bigger drums, which are sitting on the floor, floor toms, right", "tim ferriss: yeah", "so having those on the left is not normal", "dave elitch: not normal, yeah", "tim ferriss: so why would you do that", "dave elitch: so i put it on my left so i could put my notes on the left and didn\u2019t think anyone would see them", "i go to the bathroom after the first set, and i come back, and it\u2019s all gone", " tim ferriss: oh, fuck", "dave elitch: yeah", "and i was like, \u201cuh\u2026\u201d and the bass player is like, \u201cit\u2019s cool, man", "you got it", "it\u2019s all good", "you don\u2019t need those.\u201d and i didn\u2019t", " tim ferriss: you\u2019re like, \u201cthanks, bass player who\u2019s done this set 400 times.\u201d dave elitch: exactly, yeah, yeah", "\u201cokay, great.\u201d  tim ferriss: i want to note something for folks, and i\u2019m so glad we got into this because that particular way that you laid out your progression for practicing a song is nearly identical to how a lot of the best public speakers also prepare their keynotes", "they will take a keynote \u2013 and i learned to do this as well, but i was borrowing from other people \u2013 and instead of \u2013 let\u2019s just say for the sake of simplicity, a 60-minute keynote \u2013 rather than trying to give the 60-minute keynote from start to finish, they\u2019ll break it into four pieces", " or what they\u2019ll do \u2013 and this is something i started to model \u2013 is because the beginning and the ending is so important, actually breaking out the first five minutes and the last five minutes", "let\u2019s make it simple", "if it\u2019s a 40-minute talk \u2013 this will make the math a little easier \u2013 first five minutes, then you have three 10-minute sections and then the last five minutes", "and to practice each one of those individually, as opposed to in sequence", "initially, not paying attention to time, although having some rough idea of the total length", "and then recording, listening to it, making these post-game analysis edits necessary", " and then also at a later point \u2013 and i picked this up from someone as well when i was practicing, you\u2019re talking about the bras and the panties and everything \u2013 when i was preparing for my ted talk about a year and a half ago, which was going to be the opening session, main stage, nervous as fuck", "just as a side note \u2013 i\u2019m sure you have a million of these, so i\u2019d love to hear some of these war stories \u2013 there\u2019s this area behind the stage at ted, which is called something hilarious like the zen room or the chill-out room where the people who are on deck, like the three or four speakers who are on deck, are meant to hang out there with their little misters and cold water and so on", " you walk in there, at least when i walked in there, it was some of the most polished speakers in the world basically freaking the fuck out", "i was like, \u201ci need to leave here now!\u201d dave elitch: this isn\u2019t helping", " tim ferriss: \u201ci need to leave right now.\u201d this is like being in the water with bear grylls and all his survival experts, and they\u2019re losing their shit because there are like great white sharks in the water", "you\u2019re like, \u201cthis is not helpful", "i need not to be here.\u201d but one of the things that i\u2019d done in the last week or so of preparation was to load myself up on way too much caffeine, like three or four coffees, before giving dress rehearsals before strangers at my friends\u2019 companies", "i would have them call in people during lunch hour, and i would give a rehearsal in front of people who probably didn\u2019t particularly want to be there", "not a super-warm crowd, who don\u2019t care about my feelings, particularly", " dave elitch: and you\u2019re all jacked", "tim ferriss: and i\u2019m jacked to try to simulate the adrenaline i would feel when i actually got out there", " dave elitch: that\u2019s smart, yeah", "tim ferriss: in any case, i don\u2019t want to brain vomit on you too much", " dave elitch: no, it\u2019s all good", "that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for", "tim ferriss: i\u2019ll reserve some of my brain vomit for later", "but the point being that progression you use applies to so many things", "we\u2019re going to comment", "you can see my fondling these \u2013 fondling is a strange word \u2013 but these gifts", "gifts, people", "get your mind out of the gutter \u2013 that you gave me, which i do want to talk about", "you\u2019ve followed this progression song-by-song", "you\u2019ve gone through the set twice", "hour before you get on stage, what does that hour look like", "for that particular mercenary gig", " dave elitch: it\u2019s extremely stressful", "you\u2019re waking up in the middle of the night going, \u201chuh, huh, how does that bridge go?\u201d like freaking out", "because you have the weight of the world on your shoulders", "it\u2019s extremely stressful and in a lot of these situations \u2013 it was funny", "i was thinking about how to sort of present this to the laymen", "it\u2019s like your first day on the job", "it\u2019s some really, you got like a giant promotion, or you\u2019re at a new company, different title, different role", "and you roll in, and you meet everyone", "you pick five random people out of the office, and you say, \u201cgreat", "you guys are going to go on stage in front of 30,000 people together.\u201d you just met", " or you\u2019re going to spend the next month in a bus together, waking up next to each other", "it\u2019s a very weird situation", "who knows how that\u2019s going to work out as far as personalities and everything", "but the hour before the show, i\u2019ve done the sam harris guided meditation", "i just go to an area by myself and sit down and breathe and just try to stay as relaxed as possible", " tim ferriss: this is the 10-minute", "dave elitch: yeah", " tim ferriss: for people who don\u2019t know, this is sam harris, a neuroscience ph.d", "and also a very well-known author", "i think he\u2019s at samharris.org, two r\u2019s, one s", "he has a number of really good guided meditations", "so you will have done that", "dave elitch: yeah", "tim ferriss: is that the morning of", "is that right before", "dave elitch: both", "if i\u2019m feeling really anxious, i\u2019ll do it right before", "one of the things that took years me years of touring to figure out is a lot of people will \u2013 drumming is an incredibly physical instrument, especially with how hard i can hit at times, and you really have to treat yourself like an athlete \u2013 a lot of people will sit there and \u201cwarm up\u201d on a rubber pad and gingerly hit it around for 10 or 15 minutes and then they go out onstage and their feet are cold", "i started bringing a jump rope on tour with me", "i was just like, \u201coh, my god, how did i not figure this out earlier?\u201d  i skip rope for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and that gets the blood flowing so when i walk out onstage, i feel like i\u2019m three songs in already, which is a game changer, physiologically", "i\u2019ll do that", "it gets your head in the zone", "because skipping rope is the same exact thing as playing a musical instrument in terms of focus", "it\u2019s like a detached focus", "if you think about what you\u2019re doing, you use a different part of your brain neurologically, and you\u2019ll screw up whatever you\u2019re doing if it\u2019s a highly learned, embedded task", " so if you\u2019re skipping rope and you think about what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll hit your feet, and you\u2019ll screw it all up", "if i\u2019m playing a show, i have to be either totally zenned out and not thinking about anything at all or i have to think about what i\u2019m eating after the show or doing laundry or whatever", "i can\u2019t think, \u201chere comes this part\u201d or \u201cright, right, left, left,\u201d or i\u2019ll immediately bungle whatever i\u2019m doing", "but skipping rope gets my head in that mindset", "it also gets me warmed up", "so yeah, it\u2019s just a lot of pacing", "i don\u2019t drink coffee or red bulls or anything because i know my heart rate\u2019s already going to be insane, so i try not to do that", " tim ferriss: do you have anything that you, any particular rituals or things that you say to yourself before you go out or if you are, alternatively, do you take either or both of these \u2013 when you\u2019re talking to a professional who perhaps is really nervous about a tour they\u2019re about to do or gigs that they\u2019re doing, what\u2019s your advice to them right before they go out", " dave elitch: my advice is what i try to live by in that if you put the time in and you know the material, there\u2019s nothing to be nervous about because you know what you\u2019re doing", "as soon as you get on stage, after about five minutes and the adrenaline wears off, you should be comfortable", "because you\u2019re like, \u201ci couldn\u2019t have put in more time", "i put in the time", "i know what i\u2019m doing", "this is fine.\u201d what\u2019s really scary is when you don\u2019t have the time to put the work in; then that\u2019s freaky", "i try to never put myself in those situations", "but yeah, as long as you put in the time", " when i\u2019m working with someone, i make sure they put in the time", "usually, it\u2019s a lot of guys who\u2019ve been in bands for a long time", "they have an ample amount; they might have a month of rehearsals", "so it\u2019s not about whether i know this material", "it\u2019s maybe some other issue", "but i tell everyone to do the sam harris guided meditation, especially people who aren\u2019t familiar with that", "because when i first started doing it, i literally had to relearn how to breathe", "tim ferriss: the guided meditation", "dave elitch: yeah", "my breathing was \u2013 because i was driving to the studio and i was recording this record with this band called antemasque that i did with omar and cedric from the mars volta after the mars volta", "flea was playing bass on it from the chili peppers", "i had just finished doing the killer be killed record, which is a metal band i was in, and i had to learn the miley set after being in the studio all day with antemasque", "so i was driving to the studio, and i was white-knuckling the steering wheel, and i was holding my breath", "i realized, \u201coh, my god, am i doing this all the time?\u201d  tim ferriss: is this my normal", "dave elitch: yeah", "this is crazy", "then i started paying attention to it, and i realized i was holding my breath all the time", "when i started doing the short guided meditation, i realized, \u201coh, my god, i don\u2019t know how to breathe anymore.\u201d i had to literally learn how to take a full breath because i didn\u2019t, just from getting kicked in the balls over and over again and daily life, your breathing gets shallow", "so that was massive for me", " as far as the rituals, that\u2019s huge", "even if i don\u2019t have time to sit down and fully do the meditation, i\u2019ll try and get into that headspace, because if you start your day with that, you can very easily go back and access that mindset later on", "it\u2019s much easier for me to go, \u201cokay, feeling stressed, okay, there\u2019s a full breath.\u201d whereas if i didn\u2019t start my day off doing that, i might not physically be able to access that full breath", "tim ferriss: right", "you haven\u2019t limbered up", "dave elitch: yes", " tim ferriss: psychologically and physically", " dave elitch: yeah, it\u2019s huge", "tim ferriss: the breathing, facial tension", "yesterday you were asking me when i was sitting at the kit about the jaw and the mouth", "we were chatting about that last night", "well, is it just from the standpoint of teaching, there are so many different skills that can be enhanced, oddly enough, by paying attention to mouth, jaw, tongue relaxation", "we were chatting last night about \u201cis it best to tell someone to relax the jaw, or is that too hard?\u201d and, in fact, if you ask someone to relax the tongue, do you get that entire structure to relax more easily", " all of which transcends music specifically", "this is a conversation i\u2019ve had a lot with someone who\u2019s been on the podcast, kelly starrett, who always talks about breathing and positions", "if you can\u2019t breathe in the position, you do not earn the position", " dave elitch: that\u2019s why i was so excited about doing this with you", "because i knew there was going to be tons of carryover from different disciplines", "that\u2019s what i really love", "so you telling me, \u201cif you relax your tongue, you\u2019ll relax your whole face and your jaw.\u201d i was like, \u201cof course.\u201d that\u2019s huge, and that\u2019s the way i\u2019m going to present it to people from now on because that\u2019s a better way to teach it", " tim ferriss: you and i were having a conversation last night, romantic, candle-lit, hot tub conversation", " dave elitch: amongst ice, ice baths", "tim ferriss: that\u2019s true", "we did ice baths, which is also a great opportunity to work on breathing, big time", " dave elitch: breathing", "holy shit", " tim ferriss: we can have a round 2", "we were chatting about, in part \u2013 we were talking about a lot of things \u2013 about what keeps me excited", "my answer was seeing the interconnectedness and the transferability of these types of concepts because even if you bleed the stone and work in one area on one discipline, and you get to a point where perhaps you just feel fatigued and want to try something else, but you\u2019re not sure if you could ever recapture the excitement you felt in the nascent stages of that first dominant skill", " for me, i\u2019ve realized that there are thousands of different disciplines you could be exposed to and take to like a fish to water because you have knowingly or unknowingly developed all of these meta-skills that apply", "you gave me a few gifts that i alluded to fondling earlier", "one of them i\u2019m holding here, and i\u2019d love for you to tell people what it is and why you gave it to me", "dave elitch: sure", "this is a book called the inner game of tennis by timothy gallwey", "it came out in 1974", "it\u2019s one of those books where people are like, \u201coh, yeah, that book.\u201d it had a huge effect, and there are all sorts of spinoffs", "the inner game of music is actually a book", "the amazing thing with this book is \u2013 both of us have read a lot about zen buddhism \u2013 the thing about zen buddhism is by the very nature of what it is, it\u2019s very difficult to pin down and point at directly and define because it\u2019s so amorphous", "this is the first thing i ever read where he nails it down in the context of tennis", "it\u2019s easier to do that way", "tim ferriss: are you a tennis player", " dave elitch: i\u2019m not", " tim ferriss: this is important", " dave elitch: yeah", "so the book talks about essentially these two selves that we have", "self 1 and self 2", "self 1 is the analytical, cruel self-talk, harsh critic who you hit the ball into the net \u2013 if we\u2019re going to stick with the tennis analogy \u2013 and self 1 is like, \u201coh, you fucking piece of shit", "come on, get it together.\u201d and self 2 is your subconscious automatic self that\u2019s just, \u201chey, i\u2019m just trying to make this happen here.\u201d the whole idea is calming down the critical, analytical self 1, your self-talk, and letting self 2, the automatic subconscious, take over", "if you let that happen, everything will happen automatically", " so what\u2019s interesting is what i do with so many people is very technique oriented", "this book can be described as an anti-technique because it\u2019s sort of the opposite way of coming about it", "but what\u2019s interesting about this is with the zen stuff, they will lead you down a path and then just leave you there, a lot of times", "the brilliant thing with this book is it\u2019s very easy to understand", "anyone can pick it up and learn", "you can replace tennis with any other thing, any other discipline", " the brilliant thing about this book is it takes you somewhere and he\u2019s like, this is a plateau you have to overcome and this is how you do it", "that happens multiple times in the book", "tim ferriss: this is the problem", "here are a few approaches to resolving the problem", "dave elitch: as a for-instance, if you\u2019re really getting in your head \u2013 i\u2019ll stick with the tennis analogy \u2013 in a match, and you need a device to overcome that self 1, because like i was saying earlier, if you think physiologically about what you\u2019re doing in terms of movement, you use a different structure in your brain and you\u2019ll botch it", "so if you\u2019re serving a tennis ball, you throw the ball up, you go, \u201ci throw the ball up, then i move my racquet,\u201d you\u2019re fucked", "you\u2019re going to hit the net every time", "so in order to not do that, he\u2019ll say, \u201cfocus on the laces of the ball as it\u2019s coming at you\u201d or \u201cfocus on the whop of the sound when you get a good hit\u201d and just focus on those things in and of themselves that will take you into that space", "we were talking about this last night", "everyone that talks about being in the zone or being on that fire, that kind of thing, as a state you can willingly inhabit, it\u2019s not really a thing", "it\u2019s not really true", "you can set the stage for it by this type of thing, but you can\u2019t willingly enter into that or else everybody would do that all the time", "when i\u2019m having these out-of-body experiences when i\u2019m playing music, which is what gets you to do it in the first place, sort of time slows down and unfolds in front of you and you see what you\u2019re going to play", " tim ferriss: neo back-bending with the bullets flying by", "dave elitch: it\u2019s exactly the same thing", "that\u2019s what got me hooked", "that matrix thing", "you can use that in any discipline", " tim ferriss: and you can\u2019t, as you said, guarantee that you can follow the boot-up sequence and automatically enter flow at any point in time, but you can increase the odds", "dave elitch: sure, absolutely", " tim ferriss: you can increase the odds", "dave elitch: absolutely", "tim ferriss: you were mentioning it in the context of tennis or a tennis serve, but last night when we were tooling around on the drum kit, it\u2019s very similar, right", " dave elitch: mm-hmm", "tim ferriss: you were asking me to note the difference in sound from switching from a french grip, thumb on top, to a german grip, which is all more internally rotated", "dave elitch: yeah, a flat hand", "tim ferriss: flatter hand", "but using the wrist", "dave elitch: as a whip", "tim ferriss: as a whip for rim shot or on the snare drum", "you were asking me to notice the feel and the sound of it", "dave elitch: what\u2019s amazing about this is we\u2019re playing an electronic kit", "we\u2019re not playing an acoustic kit", "so even though you\u2019re hearing sounds, theoretically, it shouldn\u2019t really sound any different because it\u2019s not real", "you know what i mean", " tim ferriss: yeah", "dave elitch: but that\u2019s what\u2019s even cooler about this", "being on an electronic kit is once we got you relaxing and getting those techniques happening, and trimming the fat, your vibe and your feel were totally different, even in that situation", " tim ferriss: the sound or the queuing into that sound or feeling, much like anyone who has played tennis, and i\u2019ve played very little tennis, knows the gratification of that proper thwack when you really hit it in the sweet spot or anyone who\u2019s boxed and found that sweet spot on a heavy bag", "it acts as an anchor for the 27 biomechanical ingredients that make it up, but if you try to recall the 27 separate ingredients discretely when you\u2019re pulling your arm back to hit the ball, you\u2019re fucked", " dave elitch: you hit the nail on the head, man", "that is exactly the kind of stuff that i find so exciting are those carryovers", "when you hit a home run, when you smash a baseball, it doesn\u2019t feel like you did anything", "whereas if you hit it wonky, you\u2019re like [sound effects]", "you know what i mean", "it\u2019s terrible", "tim ferriss: yeah", "dave elitch: it\u2019s the same thing with drums", "when you hit them right, the energy should be going out, not back in", "it\u2019s the same with anything else, any athletic movement", " tim ferriss: you gave this book, the inner game of tennis, to \u2013 and we\u2019re definitely going to come back to this topic \u2013 to your therapist, who is 81", "dave elitch: something like that, yeah", "tim ferriss: 80-something and a very wise woman", "it now has a prominent place on her shelf", "dave elitch: yeah, it has a spot on her mantle", "one of the five or six books she gives out to people regularly", "tim ferriss: i didn\u2019t ask you this because i don\u2019t think you mentioned the five or six other books, but do you know offhand any of the other books", "dave elitch: the pia mellody, facing love addiction, is one of them", "tim ferriss: pia mellody, p-i-a mellody", "dave elitch: yeah", "i don\u2019t know the other ones", " tim ferriss: we can make that a bonus feature for the show notes", " dave elitch: i\u2019ll look closer next time", " tim ferriss: we\u2019ll put those in the show notes", "let\u2019s take a look at these other two because i think they are also a fun way to dissect you a bit", "let\u2019s go with this one next", "this is a very small book, and i always get excited about small books", " dave elitch: one would not think that", " tim ferriss: one would not think that", "every time i set out to write a 20-page children\u2019s book, it ends up being a 700-page bludgeoning tool", "this is titled the medium is the massage", "subtitled, an inventory of effects", "marshall mcluhan", "is that how you say it", " dave elitch: that\u2019s it", " tim ferriss: m, little c, uppercase l-u-h-a-n", "and quentin fiore", "is he the graphic designer", "dave elitch: yes", " tim ferriss: and then produced, i didn\u2019t even notice that, by jerome agel, i suppose, something like that", "dave elitch: yeah", "tim ferriss: who knows", "that\u2019s not something i typically see associated with books, so i\u2019m not sure what that means", "tell me about this book", "dave elitch: marshall mcluhan was a really interesting and very popular social and media theorist in the \u201850s and \u201860s, so i find it really fascinating that he\u2019s not a household name now, being that media is such a massive part of everyone\u2019s life now, especially people who do their own thing", "we have to have instagram and twitter and all that stuff", "you don\u2019t have a choice, right", "so i find societal issues and media and how we process and consume media very interesting", "this dude was so ahead of everyone by decades", "it\u2019s almost creepy", "tim ferriss: just in terms of his predictive ability", "dave elitch: yeah", "the interesting thing about him is he would spout off all sorts of inflammatory, crazy things", "people would get furious about certain things, or pick things apart", "he would contradict himself all the time, and make these grand statements", "that maybe would\u2019ve bothered me years ago, but now, as long as there are gems throughout and he hits the nail on the head in certain areas, and i can take away things that shift my perspective as a whole, that\u2019s all that matters to me", "so the medium is the message", "this is actually the medium is the massage because they screwed up when they \u2013 tim ferriss: that\u2019s so funny", "i didn\u2019t even notice that", " dave elitch: i know", "they screwed up when they were printing it originally, and he thought it was hilarious and he\u2019s like, just leave it, it\u2019s fine", "so it was supposed to be the medium is the message, but it\u2019s actually the medium is the massage", "he\u2019s like, \u201cthat\u2019s great.\u201d  tim ferriss: that\u2019s great", "let\u2019s keep it", "dave elitch: he loved puns", "he was kind of a quirky, weird dude", "the whole idea of that phrase is that the medium with which information is submitted to you is more important than the actual information itself", "an example i like to use is something like auto-tune", "for people who don\u2019t know what auto-tune is, if you think of that cher song do you believe in love, whatever, that was 20 years ago", "auto-tune is a software that people use to correct someone\u2019s vocal take", "so if someone\u2019s vocal take is wonky, they just sort of massage it a little bit", "tim ferriss: it\u2019s been used quite a bit in hip-hop", "dave elitch: yes", "what the new thing with that cher song is they used a different key signature to auto-tune it, so it way over-corrected itself, and that\u2019s what got that weird, now t-pain sort of sound", "drake", "as something that was an experiment, now has currently changed the way music is", "the software itself has now changed the art form to the point where i\u2019ll have producer friends of mine tracking someone doing vocals in their 20s, and they\u2019re like, \u201chey, why does my voice sound weird?\u201d they\u2019re like, \u201cthat\u2019s what your voice sounds like.\u201d  tim ferriss: oh, uncorrected", "dave elitch: they expect it to sound auto-tuned", "so the technology has now affected the art form", "tim ferriss: it not only changed the content, but it also changed the perception of the raw materials", "dave elitch: yeah", "and you could say the same thing about, there\u2019s something called beat detective, which is something drummers the world over hate", "it\u2019s the same sort of a thing for drummers", "so you can track something, record something in a studio, and then they will artificially adjust everything to a grid", "if someone\u2019s lazy about it, they snap it to the grid, and it\u2019s just like [sound effects], it\u2019s very stiff and computer-like because that\u2019s what it\u2019s been turned into", "tim ferriss: spock on drums", "dave elitch: exactly", "but people got used to hearing that", " tim ferriss: can you remove the soul from my music", "dave elitch: yeah", "so i\u2019ve done sessions where i\u2019ll go in, and i think i\u2019ve done a pretty good job", "then i\u2019ll hear it back, and i\u2019m like, \u201cwhy did you even have me play on this?\u201d because they\u2019re just lazy", "it\u2019s more about them being lazy and not going through and, you know", "but people got used to hearing how quote, unquote \u201cperfect\u201d that is", "and if someone hears something that rushes or drags or is a little bit not perfect, they\u2019re like, \u201cthis is weird.\u201d and so a lot of things are beat-detected to the point where it\u2019s just totally artificial now", "tim ferriss: you\u2019ve drained the blood", "dave elitch: yes", "and then the pendulum will swing back", "that\u2019s why adele was so successful, because it was real music", "tim ferriss: and jack johnson", "dave elitch: yeah, exactly", "tim ferriss: you do have the pendulum sometimes swing in the opposite direction", "is your interest in this \u2013 because i know it\u2019s not limited just to this book \u2013 and, one, i wanted to bring up you have mentioned this to me many times", "in fact, this is a documentary series that has come up repeatedly on this podcast", "i\u2019m embarrassed to say that i still have not seen it", "adam curtis\u2019 bbc documentary series, the century of the self and hypernormalisation", "so you\u2019ve said it changed the way that you saw the world forever", "i\u2019ll just continue here", " even if you just check out \u2013 these are your words \u2013 the first 20 minutes of century of the self, it\u2019ll blow your mind", "maybe you could segue into the century of the self and hypernormalisation", "tell me why this is so interesting to you", "because this seems to be fanatically something that is of great interest to you", "we were just talking about beat detective and other things", "people might assume it\u2019s because he\u2019s a musician and it\u2019s how these things affect music", "but i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true", "so could you talk about how you found century of the self", "because it has come up surprisingly frequently on this podcast", "and why does it grab your attention", " dave elitch: my buddy, chris, is a musician friend of mine", "he told me about it years ago", "i think it came out in 2000", "i\u2019d have to double-check that", "the premise of century of the self is it starts with focusing on edward bernays", "edward bernays was sigmund freud\u2019s nephew", "he took all of sigmund freud\u2019s theories on the subconscious and came to the conclusion that human beings are either savage animals that are going to rip each other apart, or they can be controlled and made docile via consumerism", " tim ferriss: the opiate for the masses", "dave elitch: yeah, it\u2019s literally that", "edward bernays used some of these tactics that he pioneered in propaganda for world war i", "then after world war i, he was like, \u201cwell, we can use these in peacetime for capitalists.\u201d  tim ferriss: selling more detergent", "dave elitch: yes", "so the whole notion of you buying a pair of shoes to express your inner self was single-handedly formulated by him", "so we think that\u2019s just always been around", "but really, before him, if people were thirsty, they drank water", "they would wear shirts for years", "as that dude who i\u2019m a big fan of, slavoj\u00a0\u017ei\u017eek \u2013 tim ferriss: we\u2019re going to come back to this", "he\u2019s a slovenian philosopher", "s-l-a-v-o-j", "second name, z-i-z-e-k", "amazing name", "please continue", "dave elitch: amazing person", "tim ferriss: we\u2019ll come back to that", " dave elitch: what he talks about, he says once you drink coke instead of water, the excess is with us forever", "you can\u2019t go backward", "he did interesting things like having a bunch of women smoke cigarettes", "there was some sort of subconscious phallic connotation with that", "but at the time, women didn\u2019t smoke", "he hired a bunch of attractive women to smoke in a parade or in public or something, to get it sort of \u201ctrending.\u201d  tim ferriss: it\u2019s like having the celebrity wear the sneakers", " dave elitch: exactly", "so he created focus groups", "he created the idea of pr", "this is all him", "so this guy single-handedly shaped america as we know it", "of course, america affects everything else in the world", "up until recently, anyway", "especially the world we live in now with instagram and social media", "he\u2019s maybe the most influential person in terms of society", "tim ferriss: whose name most people don\u2019t recognize", "dave elitch: yeah", "it blows my mind", "he would be a household name", " tim ferriss: this is edward bernays", "dave elitch: yes", "the documentary \u2013 tim ferriss: b-e-r-n-a-y-s, for people wondering", " dave elitch: what\u2019s interesting is you would think he made himself famous via sigmund freud, but it was actually the other way around", "he took all of his tactics and made sigmund freud into sigmund freud", "it\u2019s crazy", " tim ferriss: that i didn\u2019t, i had no idea", "that\u2019s really wild", "dave elitch: it\u2019s four one-hour episodes and the first episode \u2013 tim ferriss: the century of the self", "dave elitch: yeah", "it\u2019s called happiness machines", "that\u2019s the first episode", "adam curtis has a really interesting style of making these documentaries", "i saw him do a talk in los angeles when hypernormalisation came out in 2016", "he said, \u201cthese aren\u2019t really documentaries", "they\u2019re kind of just things that i make.\u201d they\u2019re almost like video essays or collages", "mcluhan talks a lot about that, presenting things as sort of a star pattern of images because language is sometimes insufficient to convey the ideas", "it can be like a weird collage", "i show this documentary to people, and they\u2019re like, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d it\u2019s really strange", "the music is really weird and bizarre", "tim ferriss: which one are you talking about", "dave elitch: sorry", "i\u2019m talking about \u2013 tim ferriss: hypernormalisation", "dave elitch: either one", "anything adam curtis has made is the same style", "it\u2019s four one-hour episodes, and it goes all the way up until the clinton administration because this idea, this edward bernays stuff weaves its way into politics", "it goes into other things too", "that completely changed the way i think about everything", "i think about it every day", "tim ferriss: what would be an example", "is it just that you\u2019re aware of the way your subconscious is being manipulated", "is it that you view other individual and collective behavior differently because you question the free will ingredient", "how does it on a day-to-day basis impact how you think about things or view reality", "dave elitch: it\u2019s all of that", "if we\u2019re talking about consumerism, if i want to buy something, whatever it is, a drink or a snare drum, which i buy a lot of, or some art, which i also buy a lot of, i think, \u201cwhy do i want this", "what\u2019s driving this?\u201d a lot of times, the answer is different than what you think what it may be", "tim ferriss: or what you want it to be", "dave elitch: yeah", "a lot of times you\u2019re filling the void", "that\u2019s a whole other topic \u2013 existential angst", "tim ferriss: that is a big topic", "dave elitch: but that\u2019s why a lot of people are buying things", "to make themselves feel better", "tim ferriss: i heard this quote not too long ago", "it\u2019s actually in a collection of quotes", "i\u2019m such a promiscuous quote reader", "but there\u2019s one, and i don\u2019t know the attribution", "someone out there on the internet can certainly indicate who the proper attribution is", "i\u2019ll put it in the show notes as well", "i\u2019ll write down this note: mankind existential animal quote question mark", "the quote is along the lines of, \u201cman is the only animal for which his own existence is a problem to be solved.\u201d dave elitch: i love that", "yeah, i love that", "that\u2019s it right there", "tim ferriss: it\u2019s like, my dog, molly, does not seem preoccupied", "at all", " dave elitch: no, she\u2019s just having a good time", "tim ferriss: yeah", "you mentioned artwork", "we\u2019re going to come back to some music, and we\u2019re also going to jump into some of the rapid-fire questions that i love to ask", "we\u2019ve known each other for quite a while, but i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever asked, certainly 90% of those that we\u2019re going to be coming up on", "the artwork", "i follow you on instagram, and i love your drumming", "dave elitch: thanks", "tim ferriss: so don\u2019t take this the wrong way", "i find the artwork that you discover to be fascinating", "dave elitch: thanks", "tim ferriss: and strange", "dave elitch: thanks", "tim ferriss: you\u2019re welcome", "so i use your account also as a way of discovering different types of design and art", "have you always been interested in visual art, and if not, how did that become what seems like an important part of your life", "i don\u2019t know if it is", "dave elitch: yeah, it\u2019s a very important part of my life", "tim ferriss: how did it become important", "why is it important", "dave elitch: i used to make art", "i used to draw a lot and do watercolors when i was a kid", "then when i started playing drums, really young, like five, six, seven", "then when i started playing drums, i didn\u2019t do anything else", "it took my full mental capacity", "so that sort of fell by the wayside", "i hit a certain point in my career if you just have those blinders on and you\u2019re myopic about something because you\u2019re very focused and driven, you end up burning out eventually", "touring is incredibly stressful", "i hit a wall a few years ago", "tim ferriss: how old are you know", "dave elitch: 34", "tim ferriss: okay", "so like 31, 32", "dave elitch: something like that, yeah", "i turned to art as a sort of oblique form of inspiration", "tim ferriss: i don\u2019t want to hijack the flow here", "when you say hit a wall, is that physical fatigue", "what do you mean by that", "dave elitch: mental fatigue, mostly", "we were sort of talking about this last night", "you get to a certain point where you check all the boxes of things that you\u2019ve wanted to do", "i got to a certain point where i was like, \u201ci\u2019ve done everything that i wanted to do career-wise", "now, what do i do?\u201d also, i was talking to jimmy chamberlin about this", "he\u2019s a good friend of mine, and i\u2019ve been helping him out a little bit", "tim ferriss: who is that", "dave elitch: he plays drums for the smashing pumpkins", "we were having breakfast a few

and isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d i was saying, \u201cyeah, it\u2019s not amazing", "i always knew i was going to do this", "this isn\u2019t a surprise to me", "i always knew this was going to happen.\u201d in a way, it\u2019s hard to get to the top of mt", "everest and be like, \u201ci did it.\u201d because you\u2019re like, \u201cduh, of course i did it.\u201d tim ferriss: when you say, \u201ci knew it was going to happen,\u201d how much of that \u2013 and there certainly could be an option c, d, and e \u2013 but how much of that is \u201ci knew it was going to happen because i knew i was really good,\u201d versus \u201ci\u2019m just doing my fucking job", "as a professional drummer, i am putting in the work, and therefore it is my job ultimately to do x, y, and z, and i did x, y, and z, so why would i pat myself on the back for doing my job?\u201d or something else", "dave elitch: sort of both", "it\u2019s just like i\u2019m \u2013 tim ferriss: because i have a lot of the latter", "i\u2019ve struggled with that quite a bit", "\u00a0 dave elitch: i\u2019m going to work harder than you are and i\u2019m going to be the first in and the last out", "if this guy can make it work, i can certainly make it work", "it\u2019s really that sort of thing", "i always say this to people i\u2019m working with", "i\u2019m saying, look, you can have a good amount of innate ability at whatever you\u2019re doing, but the person who puts the work in is always going to surpass you", "if you have a little bit of innate ability, like i think i do, and you work harder than anyone else, obviously there\u2019s a certain amount of luck involved in anything which you can\u2019t do anything about", "but there was no other option", " with the thing i was talking about with jimmy, is he was like, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy down to the molecular, atomic level", "if you\u2019re operating from that state, things will unfold in that manner because you\u2019re working in that", "not the secret kind of bullshit", "not that crap", "he recommended this book to me, and i have so many books i have to read", "is it like on becoming yourself", "[ed", "note: breaking the

dig", " tim ferriss: i\u2019ve watched you carrying it around", "dave elitch: yeah, it\u2019s so good", "ellen langer was on her podcast", "that\u2019s how i found out about her", "tim ferriss: all right", "we will follow up", "so jimmy recommended a book that maybe on becoming something or other", " dave elitch: god, i have to look it up", "tim ferriss: what\u2019s the gist of the book or why did he recommend it", "dave elitch: it basically goes way into that in terms of a scientific vantage point", "how all of that stuff works", "it\u2019s very scientific", "tim ferriss: when you say bad stuff, you mean when you place yourself on a certain direction and make thousands of micro-decisions that are subconsciously aligned with that direction", "how things unfold", "dave elitch: yes", "how does that work scientifically instead of some voodoo, weird, i want a new car, so i\u2019m going to put that into the universe and then it\u2019ll just happen", " tim ferriss: it makes me think \u2013 again, i\u2019m going to blame it on the caffeine, but i just like jumping around and interjecting because i\u2019m too hyperactive \u2013 we were talking about maria bamford, who is a fucking amazing comedian", "at one point, she was doing this bit on having read the secret", "she said, \u201ci went home, and i created a vision board", "and on my vision board, i had all the things i wanted, and my sister came over.\u201d  her sister apparently is some very successful lawyer or something", "her sister comes over, very type a and her sister is like, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d she\u2019s like,

happen", "dave elitch: no", "but i haven\u2019t read it yet, so i\u2019m kind of talking out of my ass here", "but he was saying it\u2019s incredible", " tim ferriss: how did he think it would help you", "why did he prescribe that", " dave elitch: because we were talking about it anyway and he\u2019s like, \u201coh, have you read this book?\u201d that\u2019s sort of what it\u2019s all about",

\u201canyone who says do what you love for a living and you\u2019ll never work a day in your life hasn\u2019t done what they want to do for a living.\u201d tim ferriss: yeah, you do anything day in,

walking onstage in an arena for 15,000 people at staples center or whatever and you\u2019re like, \u201cugh.\u201d after a week, once i have the show down, i\u2019m like, \u201cugh, whatever", "making the doughnuts.\u201d especially if it\u2019s a pop thing because it\u2019s literally the same thing", "if it\u2019s something more improvised, that\u2019s a little bit more exciting", "there\u2019s something that happens that i have to help people out who are on tour for a year and a half or two years and it\u2019s pop context", "tim ferriss: holy shit", "i didn\u2019t realize tours were that long", "fuck", "dave elitch: oh, yeah, dude", "album cycle", "totally", "so you\u2019re playing the exact same thing, note-for-note, day in, day out", "tim ferriss: so it\u2019s like being on a book tour until your next book comes out, basically", "dave elitch: yup", "well, and then you\u2019ll take a break", "tim ferriss: you\u2019ll do some recording", "dave elitch: you\u2019ll take a break, do a new record", "but yeah, it\u2019s intense", "you\u2019re out with the same people, the same techs", "you\u2019re away from your family", "it\u2019s pretty rough", "something that happens to people is they\u2019re playing the same thing over and over and over again", "i mean literally note-for-note", "if you\u2019re playing pop, like when i was doing miley, that\u2019s a massive production",

giant hot dog 20 feet above the air in the arena", "there\u2019s a lot of things that go on there", " so you can\u2019t do anything differently because the dancers will be like, what just happened", "so you have people playing the exact same thing note-for-note for a year and a half, two years, and they start to lose their mind because it\u2019s so monotonous and representative", " tim ferriss: yeah, it\u2019s like the polar bear doing the lap in the one 10-foot pool in the enclosure", "dave elitch: exactly", "it\u2019s exactly the same thing", "what starts happening is your brain starts creating weird quagmires for you to fall into because it\u2019s bored", " tim ferriss: what would be an example of that", "dave elitch: so for instance, you\u2019ll get to a certain part, and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cwhy can\u2019t i play that", "it\u2019s not hard to play.\u201d there was a guy i was working with who has played with janet jackson for a year, a lot of people", "he\u2019s a fantastic drummer", "he had some issues with his foot", "he went to see someone in atlanta, like a neurologist", "she had some helmet that he put on", "we were looking at the technique, the physical issues", "i guess there were some parts of his brain that were turned off to control the foot", "it\u2019s crazy", "i don\u2019t know how that technology works, but your brain will fuck with you", " there were times with the mars volta or with miley or whatever where i would be like, \u201coh, here comes this part.\u201d you\u2019re already dead in the water", "or when i was doing m83, there was one section where i would hear the beat in the wrong place", " tim ferriss: weird", "you had like an auditory hallucination", "dave elitch: yes", "it was a very simple section", "i remember at sound check, me going like, \u201cwhoa, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d this is like, and your brain is like, \u201ci need something to do.\u201d it\u2019s crazy", "i forgot why i got on that tangent",

aren\u2019t a lot of people you can talk to about certain things, right", "so we were just going back and forth with that type of thing", "the thing with him is he is in a band that\u2019s still huge", "this is the thing that\u2019s uncontrollable in the music industry", "there are tons of parables here", "i can work really hard, and it doesn\u2019t matter if my band makes it or not in a way that if you really hit the lottery, that\u2019s totally outside of your control", " they put in all the hard work, but that band hit the lottery", "that is out of your control", "but again, you can sort of set the stage for it", "where he\u2019s coming from, because he\u2019s in a band that is huge, is totally different from someone like me, who is a mercenary", " tim ferriss: a blackwater sniper of drumming technicians", " dave elitch: totally", "it\u2019s a totally different thing", "he\u2019s very intelligent and a great player, and a really great guy, too", "he\u2019s amazing", "you guys would get along really well", "tim ferriss: yeah, i\u2019d love to meet him", "dave elitch: yeah, for sure", "tim ferriss: how long has he been the drummer", "dave elitch: he took a break for a while and then he recently got back together with them, and they\u2019re on tour right now doing their new record", "tim ferriss: cool", "there are so many tracks that just fueled me through so many parts of college and other points \u2013 zero, bullet with butterfly wings", " dave elitch: yeah, dude", "i love that song", "tim ferriss: so amazing", "i think we should maybe jump into some rapid fire", "and we will incorporate this", "thank you for the index finger point", "we\u2019re not going to miss this, because you mentioned a word earlier, which is a very useful word,

strategies", "but first, since we\u2019ve consumed several black teas, several green teas, several topo chicos, and are working our way through a couple of cappuccinos and more green tea, we\u2019ll talk a short bio break and return for your listening pleasure", "we\u2019ll be right back", "and we\u2019re back, as promised", "oblique strategies", "this is a black case that is holding what looks like a deck of cards", "this deck of cards has all sorts of things written on them", "the first two which i pulled out yesterday, which were highly relevant to a number of corners i\u2019ve painted myself into recently, where card no", "1 \u2013 simple subtraction", "card no", "2 \u2013 what mistakes did you make last time", "what are these oblique strategies", "dave elitch: they\u2019re cards that brian eno and peter schmidt made together in 1975", " tim ferriss: who are those two people", "dave elitch: brian eno is a super-famous musician", "he\u2019s done a lot of different things over the years, but he was first famous with the band, roxy music", "he went on later to pioneer ambient music with music for airports", " tim ferriss: literally music for airports", " dave elitch: that\u2019s what the record is called", "it\u2019s called music for airports", "sorry, i should have clarified that", "tim ferriss: i feel like they would get along with mcluhan and the medium is the massage", " dave elitch: he wanted to make something that neither had a beginning or an end, and you could tune in and out of, and it didn\u2019t really matter", "he\u2019s a very interesting, brilliant person", "these are strategies when you\u2019re making anything", "this is in the context of making music, but you can obviously apply them to anything", "the device is to knock you out of your present state of mind", "like you said when you paint yourself into a corner", "you\u2019re like, \u201ci\u2019ve got to get out of this.\u201d  tim ferriss: or you just feel like you\u2019ve painted yourself into a corner", "dave elitch: sure", "well, that\u2019s a whole other thing, right", "tim ferriss: yeah", "dave elitch: there\u2019s a whole deck of cards that are very simple, minimalist suggestions", "the ones that you picked out, you already said", "but if we pick out a few random ones", " tim ferriss: tidy up", "do something boring", "the most important thing is the thing most easily forgotten", "ain\u2019t that the truth", "overtly resist change", "discipline self-indulgence", "so these are prompts, in a way", "dave elitch: yeah", "tim ferriss: for getting unstuck or un-fucked", " dave elitch: i\u2019ve had a set of these for years, and i thought you would be super into these", " tim ferriss: how do you use these cards", "i\u2019ll just buy a little bit of time because i notice there\u2019s a description card, which i hadn\u2019t noticed earlier", "\u201cthese cards evolved from separate observations of the principles underlying what we were doing.\u201d what we were doing, i\u2019m imagining, is very much musically related", "\u201cbut sometimes they were recognized in retrospect, i.e., intellect catching up with intuition", "sometimes they were identified as they were happening", "sometimes they were formulated", "they can be used as a pack", " a set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind, or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation", "in this case, the card is trusted, even if its appropriateness is quite unclear", "they are not final, as new ideas will present themselves and others will become self-evident.\u201d dave elitch: there you go", " tim ferriss: how do you use or how have you used these cards", "dave elitch: i always think about them in terms of how i\u2019m supporting music for the greater good", "a lot of times in an improvised context, these are very applicable", "because with an instrument such as drums, guitar, piano, or bass, where you don\u2019t have to breathe to play it, you run the risk of vomit chops", " tim ferriss: what does that mean", "dave elitch: it means you can just play as much as you want", "if you\u2019re playing a wind instrument, you literally have to breathe, so that affects your phrasing", "so you can pause", "with drumming, you don\u2019t have to do that", "you can play a million miles an hour forever", "after two minutes, the listener wants to kill themselves", "tim ferriss: that\u2019s true", "there isn\u2019t as much of a \u2013 there is a biological limiter, but it\u2019s not as obvious to the listener", "dave elitch: no", "yeah, with saxophone or something, you have to breathe every 15 or 20 seconds, so you have to have a space", "that clich\u00e9 thing of it\u2019s not about what you play; it\u2019s about what you don\u2019t play, that\u2019s clich\u00e9 for a reason", "it\u2019s really true", "that\u2019s something that i try to focus on a lot because if you have a lot of facility, it\u2019s very easy to just barf all over the place and overwhelm everyone", " tim ferriss: i\u2019m not a musician, as i\u2019ve stated repeatedly", "i remember someone said to me, music is the space between the notes", "i was like, \u201cooh, interesting.\u201d  dave elitch: with drumming, especially because you\u2019re keeping time for everyone, it\u2019s a very meditative state", "a lot of people will count in between the notes, and they\u2019ll be very precise about it", "i\u2019ve always tried to be very zen about it and just feel the void in between the notes that you\u2019re playing", "it\u2019s two totally different ways of doing it", "depending on what you\u2019re doing at the moment, one could be better than the other", "but yeah, man", " tim ferriss: give me an example, if you could", "it could be hypothetical", "when would you pull out this deck and be like, \u201call right, i really feel like i need one of these cards.\u201d  dave elitch: i do a lot of the body mechanic stuff with people", "i also have people who are just like, \u201chey dude, give me a bunch of cool, crazy licks to play", "song enders", "[sound effects]", "that kind of a thing.\u201d i did that with my buddy, stacy jones, who is miley\u2019s md and drummer", " tim ferriss: md", "dave elitch: musical director, sorry", "tim ferriss: i was like, \u201cthat\u2019s a hell of a combo", "let me finish this song and then here\u2019s an epipen.\u201d dave elitch: he was like, \u201chey dude, i just want to get some rad song enders.\u201d it was like, \u201cgreat", "we can totally do that.\u201d so i showed him a bunch of licks, and we had fun", "this is the kind of situation that\u2019s great for these because people, after you\u2019re working on phrasing, after about 20 minutes, they\u2019ve played everything they know", "then they\u2019re like, \u201cwell, what do i do now?\u201d so you could just pick something out of the deck", "like you just picked out \u201cgive the game away.\u201d how you interpret that, you could go a number of ways", " tim ferriss: yeah", "it\u2019s like \u201cslow down\u201d on your shirt", "anyone who picks that up, they\u2019re like, \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cwhat does it mean to you?\u201d you could therapize them", " dave elitch: yeah, exactly", "for me, the first way i would process that is a lot of times when you\u2019re building up solos, you don\u2019t do that", "you want to lead someone in and sort of set the stage", "because if you start off on \u2013 tim ferriss: don\u2019t give them the filet mignon as the appetizer", " dave elitch: exactly", "this, to me, the way i would interpret this is, i\u2019m going to come in guns blazing and then try to work my way out of that because that\u2019s the biggest no-no", "i\u2019m going to do that on purpose and then see what happens", "someone could also say, if you\u2019re thinking about a sports analogy, \u201ci\u2019m just going to play the game and see what happens.\u201d let it happen on its own", "it\u2019s not about winning or losing", " tim ferriss: cool", "i dig it", "this is good timing for me", " dave elitch: great", "tim ferriss: we\u2019ve talked a lot about playing in front of huge crowds and the musicians you work with", "certainly, this show tends to feature people who are very good at something or another", "i would like to talk about failures or disappointments", "this is a question i really enjoy asking", "how has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success", "it could be a disappointment or anything", "do you have any particular favorite failures or failures that come to mind that were in retrospect very valuable", "dave elitch: i\u2019ve gone out for auditions for plenty of bands, and i haven\u2019t gotten gigs", "that\u2019s just how it goes", "if you go in there and, again, you\u2019re really prepared, and you fully present yourself accurately, and they don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s not the right fit, what else can you do", "you might think, \u201ci didn\u2019t get the gig; it\u2019s a failure.\u201d but what about if you \u2013 it\u2019s the same thing as dating, right", "what if you present a fake version of yourself, and then they like that, and then you have to keep doing that, and then you\u2019re like, \u201cwho am i?\u201d there\u2019s plenty of situations where i go in doing the dave smash thing like in that mars volta video, and they\u2019re like, \u201choly shit, jesus christ.\u201d  tim ferriss: get a restraining order", "dave elitch: and it\u2019s too much, and they get freaked out", "and it\u2019s like, \u201cwell, i might not be that guy all the time, but that\u2019s definitely possible.\u201d a real-life situation, which is what i always try to talk about because that\u2019s the most important thing", "so many people run into problems when they \u2013 it\u2019s hyperbole", "when i was out with the 1975 maybe a couple of years ago, george, the drummer, i\u2019ve been teaching him for a while, and he broke his collarbone on tour", "this was the same type of situation", " tim ferriss: how did he break his collarbone", "maybe it\u2019s not for family programming", " dave elitch: i don\u2019t know", "but he was just like, \u201cdude, i broke my collarbone.\u201d  tim ferriss: good recovery", "continue", " dave elitch: i was like, \u201cwho knows?\u201d he was like, \u201ccan you come out here and fill in?\u201d it\u2019s the same type of situation", "i have to learn all the music last minute", "it\u2019s really large venues, arenas", "i show up in toronto, meet everyone", "we have a line check on stage, which is you make sure all the connections are working", "we run through a couple of songs, maybe", "tim ferriss: the people attempting to assemble my drum kit did not do this", " dave elitch: that was another thing", "i\u2019m like 5\u20196\u201d on a good day", "george is at least a foot taller than me, if not more", "he\u2019s very tall", "he\u2019s probably like 6\u20199\u201d", "tim ferriss: holy cow", "dave elitch: yeah, he\u2019s very tall", " tim ferriss: daddy long legs on that drum kit", "dave elitch: yeah, long legs, long arms, long everything", "so i had to rearrange his kit", "a lot of times, you have to sit down and just play it, which can present some problems", "but i had to rearrange things because it was impossible", "an outdoor stage in toronto", "10,000 people", "you just have to go for it", " tim ferriss: you said you were going through a line check and then took it off the reservation", "dave elitch: line check is like a kick drum, snare drum, guitar", "checking that everything\u2019s working", "matty, the singer, is like, \u201ccan we do this song", "let\u2019s do this song.\u201d we did a couple of songs", "then he\u2019s like, \u201cokay, great.\u201d then it\u2019s showtime", "because that\u2019s the type of situation where it\u2019s a band, and you have to come in", "the very difficult thing is you have to assume someone else\u2019s character and try to make everyone feel comfortable enough to where it\u2019s comfortable", "they were like, \u201cplay the parts, but you can have fun.\u201d i threw in some things here and there, and they were laughing and into it", " it was super fun", "we did that run for about a month", "then i sat down with matty, the singer and he was like, \u201cyou know, man, we have to do glastonbury and some bb1 stuff", "it\u2019s really important that this band sounds like the 1975", "right now, it sounds like the 1975 with dave elitch, because your personality is just huge.\u201d at the time, i was like, \u201cfuck.\u201d i was so bummed", "because i really like matty, i really like george", "all those guys", "and i really like the music a lot", "i was just like, \u201cfuck, man.\u201d then i was like, \u201cwait, this is the best compliment anyone could ever give me.\u201d because having an identity is

there, freddy sheed, a really great drummer in the u.k", "they got him to do it again until george could come back", "freddy\u2019s great, and he\u2019s a really great buddy of mine", "he did a great job", "at the time, i was just so bummed", " tim ferriss: what helped you reframe it", "when were you able to reframe it, and view it that way", "dave elitch: it took a while", "it took a few months", " tim ferriss: did you do it on your own", "did it come to clarity through therapy", "what helped", "because a lot of people don\u2019t recover", "they\u2019re not able to reframe something that might\u2019ve been a very difficult time", "it continues to be something", "that was very difficult", "dave elitch: it takes them out forever", " tim ferriss: or yeah, it just becomes this pain, this dull ache that they revisit every time they have the memory", "but you\u2019ve been able to reframe it", "dave elitch: yeah", "i think through enough experience and having enough success outside of that situation", "i can definitely see that happening if it\u2019s like that\u2019s your one shot, and that\u2019s the only amount of success you ever had", "but i\u2019ve done a lot of other things, and i did things after that and before it", "that was just that one thing", "it wasn\u2019t like \u201cyou\u2019ve fucked it up,\u201d it was like, \u201cyou\u2019re too distracting.\u201d tim ferriss: what\u2019s the shittiest music gig you\u2019ve ever had", "it could be anything", "it could be fucking halftime; it could be a rogue olive garden, i don\u2019t know", " dave elitch: man, i don\u2019t know if i can answer that without getting in trouble", "tim ferriss: have there ever been moments when you\u2019ve doubted yourself or doubted the music path", "where you\u2019ve just been like, \u201cfuck.\u201d dave elitch: all the time", "tim ferriss: any examples come to mind", "they could be super early", "they could be at any point", " dave elitch: the industry has changed so much in the past 10 or 15 years", "just the way it\u2019s structured as a business model alone makes you question things", "\u201cis this even a working model anymore?\u201d that changes on a daily basis", "just thinking about things monetarily, sometimes, \u201cdoes this even make sense?\u201d for me, \u201cam i going to go out on tour, and be away from home, and make x amount of money when i can just stay home and sleep in my own bed, and make x amount of money teaching?\u201d that kind of a thing", "then it\u2019s like, \u201cwell, do i want to teach, or do i want to play music?\u201d then it\u2019s like, \u201cthe grass is always greener.\u201d  that stuff is constantly swirling around in my head", "when you\u2019re auditioning for gigs, and you\u2019re like, \u201cthat guy got the gig", "are you kidding me?\u201d then you\u2019re like, \u201cif that\u2019s what people want, that\u2019s garbage.\u201d and everyone else is like, \u201coh, gross", "that dude\u2019s such a cheeseball", "why would they?\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201cis that what people want", "if that\u2019s what people want, why am i doing this?\u201d because no one has good taste", "you can get into that whole thing", "totally", "i think what\u2019s very important is doing a multitude of things", "i teach a lot", " that\u2019s really my bread-and-butter", "but because of that, i can be selective and learn how to say no to things because of that", "so if someone calls me \u2013 tim ferriss: to playing gigs", "dave elitch: yes", "if someone calls me for a tour and i heard a lot of bad things about the artist, like they\u2019re a pain in the ass, i\u2019ll be like, \u201cnah, i\u2019m good.\u201d i don\u2019t have to do it", "i have a lot of friends who tour, and that\u2019s all they do", " tim ferriss: they have to go", "dave elitch: they\u2019re like, \u201cgod, you\u2019re so lucky you teach", "i have to go out with this piece of shit right now.\u201d then it comes around to doing what you love for a living", "what\u2019s the point if you go out on the road and you\u2019re bumming", "so there\u2019s something to be said for the weekend warrior who goes to their suit-and-tie cubicle job, and then they get out of work, and they\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, i\u2019m going to go play drums right now,\u201d and they\u2019re stoked", "there\u2019s something to be said for that", "because it\u2019s still like a wholly special thing", " that\u2019s something that i struggle with in art because i love art so much and it\u2019s so important to me", "everyone\u2019s like, \u201cwhen are you going to start making stuff?\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cbut if i start making it, then i\u2019m part of it,\u201d and then it\u2019s tainted in a way", " tim ferriss: it makes me think of some of my friends who are very successful travel writers", "it\u2019s really hard for them to travel for fun because they\u2019re constantly thinking about, \u201cwhat would the lede be", "how would i describe this", "maybe i should take some notes, just in case.\u201d they have a very tough time experiencing travel without thinking about how they would craft the narrative", "dave elitch: same thing for me", "if you go on tour a lot, you don\u2019t want to go traveling for fun", "you\u2019re like, \u201ci was just out for six weeks", "i just want to be.\u201d everyone\u2019s like, \u201cman, you should take a vacation.\u201d i don\u2019t want to go anywhere", "tim ferriss: i want a staycation", "dave elitch: yeah, exactly", "tim ferriss: you were talking about the teaching, which i think is really a point i want to revisit because you do multiple things", "you have many different interests", "it strikes me that in a sense you\u2019ve, number one, diversified your identity in such a way that you don\u2019t feel psychologically compelled always to tour", "secondly, with the teaching and with the online course, getting out of your own way, which i think could be, maybe it will be the title of this podcast, so interrelated as it relates to \u2013 this is a terrible sentence, but you get the idea \u2013 oblique strategies, inner game of tennis", "so many of these creative pursuits, professional pursuits, personal pursuits, are not about doing something brand-new that is this gigantic skill that you have to acquire over 15 years", " a lot of it is just removing the blocks", "but the point i was going to make is you are not in a position, because you have developed these different branches of your life, where you have to feel or act out of desperation", "it makes me think, for instance, this might seem like it\u2019s totally out of left field, but arnold schwarzenegger never really auditioned", "this is something not a whole lot of people know about him", "it\u2019s not a secret", "but he made millions of dollars in real estate before he ever had his break in film", "so he focused on real estate in santa monica and other areas and also had other types of business", " he had a mail-order business", "he had a bricklaying business with franco columbu so that he could be selective about the roles he took", " dave elitch: that\u2019s incredible", " tim ferriss: so he was able to craft a trajectory, even when \u2013 you were talking about the cheeseball taking the gig \u2013 when he got started, people are like, \u201cthis is never going to work", "you\u2019re a freak show", "nobody wants that", "people want al pacino in taxi.\u201d was it taxi or taxi driver", "dave elitch: robert de niro", "tim ferriss: yeah, there we go", "wow", "how many ways can i get that story wrong", "dave elitch: we can edit that out.patience tim ferriss: close enough", "this is audio verit\u00e9, so i\u2019ll leave it in", "wow", "you get the idea", "he was able to bide his time also so that at some point he could put himself in a position where he could be exactly what people wanted", "i\u2019ll give you a public thanks also for \u2013 you can see how my brain is connecting these two \u2013 for your introduction to bill burr, a comedian who was also on this show, who you teach", "who, for people who haven\u2019t seen it, does one of the most hilarious arnold schwarzenegger bits of all time, which i won\u2019t spoil", "it is definitely not suitable for work, so don\u2019t play it at full volume on youtube at your job and then get pissed off at me on the internet", "but the diversification of identity psychologically is very important", "then the income diversification for you, allowing you to then as an artist craft a more deliberate path, i think is really important", "dave elitch: absolutely", "and if you\u2019re not being deliberate about what you\u2019re creating, then what the hell are you doing", "you\u2019re just making garbage, right", "tim ferriss: absolutely", "you mentioned george", "this is george daniel, right", " dave elitch: yup", "tim ferriss: the 1975", "he has said, and i quote, \u201camong other things,\u201d i\u2019ll read the whole thing, \u201cdave saved my arms and hands", "he made me see i could, in fact, contrary to my belief, develop a technique that would save me from blisters and helped solve tendinitis from many years of horribly inefficient technique.\u201d we don\u2019t have to talk about that", "we can, but the next line is what\u2019s interesting to me", "\u201che taught patience", "an incredible player, a really great teacher, and all-around lovely human.\u201d what does that mean by \u201che taught patience?\u201d dave elitch: i think probably, as long as someone is putting the work in, i\u2019m very patient with people, because seeing the light flash in their eyes when something clicks is one of the greatest feelings imaginable", "also, probably for him, i think to be patient with himself", "taking the time to really hone in on certain things and not having to rush through things", "just feeling like, \u201ci\u2019m going to put the work in and i\u2019m going to take the time so all this stuff happens the way it should happen.\u201d you have to be patient with that or else it\u2019s never going to manifest itself", " tim ferriss: or with something that\u2019s as physical as drumming, if you rush it and your technique is not biomechanically suitable for a human body, then \u2013 dave elitch: that\u2019s what i was saying earlier", "it\u2019s inherently an issue of the drum set as an instrument in that the way the drum set was formed initially around the turn of the century, it was called a trap kit, short for \u201ccontraption.\u201d so you think of these dudes around the late 1800s, 1900s, taking disparate concert percussion instruments like a bass drum by itself and a snare drum", "then they had to make a pedal to use the bass drum", "and the high hats were originally called low boys because they were on the floor and you only played them with your foot", " it\u2019s evolved in this really bizarre, strange way, so it\u2019s physically strange", "but also the bar is incredibly low in terms of entry", "it\u2019s very easy to play drums in the beginning", "you sit down and go [sound effects], and you\u2019re like, \u201coh, i can play drums", "i can play along to ac/dc and michael jackson", "this is great.\u201d no one thinks about how anything functions because they can already do it", "then they go out tour and 10 years later, they\u2019re like, \u201cmy arms are destroyed,\u201d or \u201cmy hip,\u201d or \u201cmy back.\u201d because they\u2019re doing everything inefficiently or incorrectly", " then also they get stuck as far as the vocabulary goes because they can\u2019t express themselves properly because they\u2019re in their own way", "a lot of it is inherently part of the instrument itself", "i always use violin as an example", "you have to sit there for six months just getting your intonation happening", "or with saxophone, you have to get your embouchure together", " tim ferriss: your what", "dave elitch: embouchure", " tim ferriss: embouchure", "what is that", "dave elitch: it\u2019s basically throat control", "how you produce air pressure", "that takes a while", "you start learning the clarinet", "you\u2019re squawking all over the place", "you have to develop that control", "you can\u2019t just sit down and make a sound", "there\u2019s a certain amount of gestation", "tim ferriss: with the drums, you can get the reward without having to develop that body control", " dave elitch: immediately", "exactly", "that\u2019s the problem", "but that\u2019s part of the instrument", "what i was going to say earlier when we were talking about being able to wear many different hats, do many different things, but be deliberate about what you\u2019re doing, i was talking to a friend about this", "he was like, \u201cyeah, if your identity is largely based on what you do for a living, whatever it is, what if you wake up one day and you don\u2019t want to do that thing", "then you\u2019re like, \u2018who am i?\u2019 that\u2019s a mind-fuck.\u201d  tim ferriss: very common", "super, super common", "for people who try to retire and then they\u2019re like, \u201cwait, i\u2019ve spent 12 hours a day for the last 30 years doing x.\u201d  dave elitch: then you have a whole other black hole where if you\u2019re a very important person and you get a lot of respect, and then you retire, you\u2019re just some guy", "that\u2019s a whole other thing to deal with", "then what are you going to do with your life when you just wake up", "are you going to play golf", "all that", "then that\u2019s a whole other thing", "tim ferriss: what would you put on a billboard, if you could put \u2013 metaphorically, right", "a message, a few words, a word", "anything", "a billboard to get out to million of people", "he\u2019s holding his t-shirt", "slow down", "dave elitch: yeah", "slow down", "because generally speaking, so many people need to do that", "slow down, take a deep breath, just relax", "tim ferriss: you can also cover up or hide a lot of your own mistakes and sloppiness from yourself by doing things too quickly", "dave elitch: absolutely", "that\u2019s very common in music", "tim ferriss: yes, very common in music", "it\u2019s very common in a lot of things", "when i watch really good boxing instructors, they\u2019re always like, \u201cslow down.\u201d in the beginning, certainly", "anybody can flail their arms around so nobody can see what you\u2019re doing exactly", "i want to see exactly what you\u2019re doing, really slowly in the beginning", "it also brings to mind one of my favorite expressions i\u2019ve learned in the last few years, which is from a friend of mine who is a former navy seal", "it\u2019s not specific to him", "it\u2019s something that you hear quite a lot", "it is \u201cslow is smooth and smooth is fast.\u201d  dave elitch: yes, i like that", "tim ferriss: do not rush", "because if you try to rush a reload or rush whatever it might be and you botch it, now you\u2019re really slow", "dave elitch: you\u2019re slower than you would even be before", " tim ferriss: yes", " dave elitch: it\u2019s the same with the weights and shit in the smaller circles", "you have to learn things in large movements or whatever you want to think about this is, whatever paradigm you want to think about this in, and then as you get more comfortable with it, it gets smaller and smaller and smaller", "then you\u2019re just throwing someone across the room", " tim ferriss: for those people wondering, that\u2019s josh waitzkin who is a fantastic guy, a good friend of mine, who is the basis for the book and the movie searching for bobby fischer", "he\u2019s really a master in many disciplines", "that\u2019s one of his concepts, for sure", " dave elitch: i tell everyone i teach to get that book", " tim ferriss: the art of learning is a fantastic book", "he was the second ever guest on this podcast", "a lot of great concepts", "also for people interested, i did a television episode with him where we looked at brazilian jiu-jitsu, which he\u2019s a black belt in, among other things", "that was the first time for that tv show that he got in front of a chess board in, i want to say 15 years, something like that", "his wife said: \u201ci cannot believe that he\u2019s getting in front of a chess board", "i\u2019ve maybe never seen him do it.\u201d  dave elitch: that thing in the episode where he talks about playing like 50 chess games at the same time", "tim ferriss: yeah, the simultaneous games", "dave elitch: yeah, and talking about feeling the flow of energy in the room and then he felt like a shift", "tim ferriss: yeah", "he felt like he had been juggling 30 balls and one of them got dropped", "he was playing, it was something like 30 kids, and one of them cheated", "and he came back around, and he didn\u2019t know exactly what had happened, but he was like, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d  dave elitch: that sounds spooky", "that\u2019s a real thing", "that episode was so affirming and exciting for me because he said a lot of things where i was like, \u201ci am doing this right", "i am on the right path.\u201d because there were so many things that we did similarly", "tim ferriss: the transfer is so clear", "dave elitch: huge", "tim ferriss: which is part of the fun", "it\u2019s a big part of the fun of having this podcast for me is interviewing people across disciplines that at first glance you would expect to have nothing to do with one another, and you just realize that people who are playing their a game in any field have more in common with one another than they do with the b players in their own field", " dave elitch: that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do with burr", "we sit down and talk about comedy and drumming and the massive amounts of overlap between the two", "when we first started working together, he had basically like a john bonham, led zeppelin, almost like a replica kit", "he\u2019s a huge bonham fan", "everyone who plays drums is a john bonham fan", "he\u2019s incredible", "he has a very specific sound", "so he got this early \u201870s, green sparkle ludwig kit", "giant 26\u201d bass drum", "it\u2019s a thing", "it\u2019s a very specific thing", "we\u2019re working together, and we\u2019re talking about identity and what he wants to say and who he wants to be and getting his posture together", " i was like, \u201cdude, you wouldn\u2019t walk out on stage and start yelling like sam kinison", "that\u2019s his thing", "you do your own thing", "you walk out on stage in front of whatever, 12,000 people at madison square garden", "you\u2019re doing your own thing", "bring that to this.\u201d he sold the kit immediately", "got his own thing", "he\u2019s figuring out what his own thing is", "that\u2019s so much fun for me to do", "he\u2019s one of the smartest dudes i know", "he\u2019s brilliant", "tim ferriss: he\u2019s a very smart guy", "within any field, you have certain philosophical underpinnings or paradigms that people choose as the foundation for a lot of their decisions and career paths and so on", "then you have the strategies, and you have the tactics", "the lower level you go in some respects, the more the fields diverge, but certainly at the higher levels, whether it\u2019s tennis, comedy, drumming, or otherwise, there are so many commonalities", "what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love", "dave elitch: that i love", "tim ferriss: i\u2019ll give you an example", "or a compulsion", "so for instance, cheryl strayed, who wrote the book, wild", "she\u2019s an excellent author and a fantastic podcast host", "the example she gave is she likes to reassemble sandwiches", "so when she gets a sandwich, it bothers her if all the tomatoes are on one side of the sandwich and the avocado is on the other", "she wants every bite to be as uniform as possible", "so she reassembles her sandwich", "i like the number 555 because i finished editing the final line on the final pass of the 4-hour body in a samovar tea shop in san francisco ages ago and looked up and it was 5:55 p.m", "so that became this good luck charm", "so i take screenshots of that whenever it pops up", "it could be anything", " dave elitch: \u00a0 it\u2019s funny", "i think to be good at anything, you need to have a touch of ocd, absolutely", "you have to be detail oriented", "i do have those things, but i can\u2019t think of anything off the top of my head, other than checking the stove 10 times when i\u2019m leaving the house", "checking my studio door four times to make sure it\u2019s locked", "i can\u2019t think of anything weirdly specific like that at the moment", " tim ferriss: no problem", "i\u2019m sure there are depths to plumb there that we can return to", "how often do you eat indian or himalayan food with some type of curry-type consistency", "dave elitch: every day, pretty much", "that\u2019s why i go to the gym six days a week, because i have to work off all the clarified butter", " tim ferriss: all right", "i\u2019ll leave that", "that may qualify", "when you feel \u2013 actually, i\u2019m not going to ask that one", "let me go somewhere else", "one thing that\u2019s come up in our conversations recently because i\u2019ve never worked with a therapist, and i\u2019ve listened to interviews you\u2019ve done where you\u2019ve mentioned therapy and your therapist", "i\u2019ve always had a certain degree of resistance, particularly to talk therapy, for a lot of reasons i won\u2019t bore everybody with", "i\u2019d like to talk about that because it seems like you\u2019ve benefited tremendously from it", "if you\u2019re comfortable talking about it, why did you end up engaging a therapist", "how did you choose your therapist", "what have been some of the benefits that you\u2019ve derived from it so far", "dave elitch: i initially \u2013 tim ferriss: sorry", "i\u2019ll continue to step all over your answers", "you, as well as a few other people, when i have mentioned that i have not worked with a therapist, they\u2019re just like, \u201cwhat in the fuck", "are you serious?\u201d  dave elitch: especially you", "tim ferriss: they\u2019re like, \u201creally?\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cokay, maybe this is something i should explore.\u201d dave elitch: yeah, absolutely", " tim ferriss: this has come up multiple times from multiple people", "your story", "dave elitch: i started seeing a therapist around when i was 30-ish", "something like that", "it was mainly to figure out relationship issues that kept happening over and over and over again", "i was like, \u201cthere\u2019s clearly something here that\u2019s a blind spot to me, and i don\u2019t know what i\u2019m doing; i need to figure this out.\u201d that was the specific reason why i started going", "i found my therapist through a really close friend of mine who is a therapist", "we obviously can\u2019t work together because she\u2019s a close friend of mine", "she was like, \u201cyou should see this person; she\u2019s incredible.\u201d  working with a therapist, having a good relationship with someone where you can really trust them, and you care about each other, it clicks", "that is unbelievably important", "there are so many bad drum teachers out there, and there are so many bad therapists out there", "it can be extremely damaging to someone", "having a good therapist who you get along with and connect with and who\u2019s very competent, that\u2019s why i picked someone \u2013 i mean, we hit it off, and it was obvious", "but she\u2019s 80", "all these life coaches running around who are like 25", "it\u2019s like, \u201cwhat the fuck do you know", "you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d  having a therapist where i can bring up anything and she\u2019s like, \u201cyup, been there.\u201d that\u2019s huge", "it started off with the relationship stuff, and then it obviously shoots off into all these other different directions", "even having someone to go in and dump on and brain vomit, who\u2019s only there to help you out, help you sort things out, the world would be a completely different place if everyone had that", "had a safe \u2013 tim ferriss: like an outlet", "dave elitch: yeah, to just unload", "tim ferriss: what are some of the ingredients for success in the beginning", "would you say that it was important for you to meet every week for a certain period of time", "given how much you potentially travel, right", "what were some of the things that made it work", "dave elitch: it\u2019s the same thing with drumming", "i\u2019m like, \u201chey look, if you\u2019re serious about this, we\u2019ve got to do this once a week,\u201d because it\u2019s like going to the gym", "you don\u2019t go two days a week for four hours", "you go every day for an hour or something", "you have consistency", "that\u2019s crucial", "you\u2019re able to make progress because it\u2019s a recurring dialogue you\u2019re having with someone", "i

different person", "a very specific example that\u2019s something small, if i\u2019m at the gym and someone reracks their weights improperly, it drives me fucking bananas", "it drives me crazy", "if
