Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers, to tease out their routines, habits, favorite books, et cetera, that you can apply to your own life. This time around we have an in-between-isode. It\u2019s not really an in-between-isode. It is an experimental Q&A episode with Naval Ravikant. The first episode we did with Naval was a massive, massive success. It was nominated for podcast of the year. Naval \u2014 @Naval \u2014 on Twitter is the co-founder of AngelList. He previously co-founded Epinions, which went public as part of Shopping.com and Vast.com. He is an active angel investor, a good buddy of mine, and has invested more than 100 companies including quite a few unicorn mega-successes. His deals include Twitter, Uber, Yammer, Postmates, Wish, Thumbtack, and OpenDNS. OpenDNS was recently bought by Cisco for around $635 million in cash. He\u2019s doing all right. He\u2019s developed an incredibly diverse set of skills and, even if you have zero interest in startups or investing, this episode, just like the one before it, is well worth the listen. Naval answers your questions, the top ten questions that were uploaded and submitted on Reddit. That ranges from artificial intelligence, and his thoughts on the pros and cons, the bull side or the bear side, if that makes any sense, to moneymaking success. What he would teach in school, favorite books, what is on his Kindle as we speak. His most popular tweet of all time, and the story behind it. Five chimps theory, and how it applies to your life. Happiness Hacks, conflict resolution. The list goes on and on. Say hello to Naval on Twitter, let him know what you thought, ask additional questions @Naval. Please enjoy this incredibly fascinating monolog with Naval Ravikant. Naval Ravikant: Hello everybody and welcome to the Tim Ferriss Show. This is Naval Ravikant. I will be now going through a large set of questions. AndrewPls asks, \u201cWhat are your thoughts about the AI industry, which seems to be dominated by an unusual amount of analytics startups, most of which do the same thing in an anti-zero to one fashion?\u201d Artificial intelligence is all the rage. People are writing books about it, talking about it, and thinking about it. I think anybody who is really talking about true general-purpose AI, the Skynet kind that will take over the world and kill us all, doesn\u2019t really write code much any more because no one has yet made any of the fundamental breakthroughs required to get to where the general-purpose AI. It\u2019s just basically writing similar code to what we\u2019ve written in the past, but it\u2019s being executed faster, or it\u2019s working with more data. The way in which the human brain works is actually very different than the way computers work. I don\u2019t think the fundamental theoretical breakthroughs are in place for general-purpose AI. I think it\u2019s mostly technophiles, or end-of-the-world types, or wishful thinking in a weird way, for people who think we\u2019re about to get a general-purpose AI. That said, the field of AI has now broadened into specific AI. Computer vision, for example. Self-driving cars. Drones that pilot themselves. These things are real. They\u2019re using huge amounts of data as well as lots of processing power, plus pretty good code to solve problems that before we would have thought are in the human domain. The real test for AI is passing the Turing test, which is, \u201cCan an AI trick someone into actually thinking they are actually a human being.\u201d I think we are barely any closer to that than we were 20 or 30 years ago. Now, there\u2019s another kind of AI which might emerge, which might be an emergent AI. For example, if you take all the computers in the world, you stitch them together, say through the internet, it could just happen that that much compute power, that much data, that much interaction could create something almost socially out of that computer network. A social AI if you will, but an AI like that is likely to be slowly, softly emergent. Probably not self-modifying in the way we think of a general AI. One that is probably more designed to serve humans, because it emerges from a network that is built by humans. It may just co-exist or be completely woven into the human fabric in such a way that it might be inseparable from humanity itself. I\u2019m not too worried about the general-purpose AI, and I also don\u2019t think that the general-purpose AI companies have much of a future. The specific AI companies, the ones that are solving a very specific problem, like the computer vision example. Those I think could be very real. Taylor Pearson asks, \u201cYou mentioned Coase\u2019s 1937 paper in your first interview, and how tech is bringing down the transaction cost that led to corporatism. What do you think the job and labor market will look like in 20 years, and how can people prepare?\u201d I mentioned in the first interview that the industrial revolution brought people together because it made them of efficient scale to do something, especially with a factory, that\u2019s very large. You need to have a hierarchy. You need to have people working for each other and working together. Now, I think information technology is lowering the communication cost, lowering the transaction cost, and people can be intermediated, or even dis-intermediated by computers and work through computers. A not-so-great example is an Uber driver, who would be getting orders through a phone. A better example, a more hopeful example might be independent contractors who are using Twitter and online sources to find jobs. AngelList, we have tons of startup jobs. There are places like pick crew or gigster where you can go get part-time jobs, Elance, Craigslist, Odesk, etc. I think the gig economy is going to be much more the future. It can very much be a very positive development. For example, if you are a world-class journalist today. If you\u2019re a world class journalist, you take great photographs; you report great news, you don\u2019t really need to go work for the New York Times. If you are willing to start in your spare time with a blog, with Twitter, you can build an independent brand. Although you start off making no money early on, kind of near the end of the curve, when you\u2019re a youtube star or a very popular blogger, you can literally be charging people for access to your blog. You can be making a very good and very independent living, where you\u2019re getting paid for books, and newsletters and working from wherever you want. I think the best way to prepare for the future 20 years is find something you love to do, to have a shot at being one of the best people in the world at it. Build an independent brand around it, with your name, not a company\u2019s name or other people\u2019s names around it. Try to make a creative work, so you\u2019ll stay interesting, stay ahead of the game. Anything that\u2019s not a creative, society can replicate and then not pay you full value over time, so it\u2019s always better to solve new problems and do new things, and get comfortable with working in a boom-bust fashion, where a couple of weeks at a time you may have a lot of work, then a couple of weeks at a time you\u2019re on vacation. I think that\u2019s kind of where the future is headed. It will be gradual, and then it will be sudden. The best way to prepare is to not give up your independence in the first place. Cher Zadian says, \u201cConfucius says that you have two lives, and the second one begins when you realize you only have one. When and how did your second life begin?\u201d That\u2019s a very deep question. Most people who are past a certain age have had this feeling or phenomenon where they\u2019ve gone through life a certain way and then gotten to a certain stage and then had to have made some pretty big changes. I\u2019m definitely also in that boat. I think for me, I struggled for a lot of my life to have certain material and social successes, and when I achieved those material and social successes, or at least beyond a point where they didn\u2019t matter as much to me any more, I realized that my peer group, and the people around me, the people who had achieved similar successes, and were on their way to achieving more and more successes, just didn\u2019t seem all that happy. In my case, there was definitely hedonic adaptation. I\u2019d very quickly get used to anything. What led me to the conclusion, which seems trite, is that happiness is internal. That set me on a path of starting to work more on my internal self and realizing that all real success is internal and has very little to do with external circumstances. One has to do the external thing anyway. That\u2019s how you\u2019re biologically hard-wired. It\u2019s glib to say, \u201cYou can just turn it off.\u201d You have to do it, and you have to have your own life experience that then brings you back onto the internal path. For me, it was just getting what I wanted was the problem. Related to that, DanielD161 asks, \u201cDo you feel an urge to know your inner self fully, and has your worldly success satisfied this urge?\u201d I would say, \u201cYeah, I absolutely do have an urge to know my inner self fully.\u201d If anything, my worldly success has taken me farther away from that urge. The more worldly success you have, the more your ego gets built up. The more fearful you might be of losing it all. The more fearful my might be about what other people think. The more you have to lose. The more you get caught up in this dream of who you think you are. I think worldly success actually hurts. If from a young age, you know that you want to know yourself and discover yourself much better, if have that foresight or insight at an early age, material success will actually take you away from it. I\u2019m not Christian, but there is that famous line in the Bible that Jesus says, \u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven.\u201d I think I understand what he means. Resputin89 says, \u201cIn the first episode Naval talked about a few topics that should be taught in school rather than learning the capital of Montana. He brought up topics like teaching what he knows worked for him, happiness, nutrition, et cetera. Can you elaborate on some of these, particularly happiness?\u201d Yeah, if I\u2019m running a grade school curriculum for children, I would probably optimize happiness, nutrition, diet, exercise, \u201cHow do you build good habits?\u201d \u201cHow do you break bad habits?\u201d \u201cHow do you have good relationships?\u201d \u201cHow do you find your spouse?\u201d Meditation, \u201cHow do you build basic skills, not memorize lots of facts?\u201d What kinds of books should you read? Older ones, not newer, ones that have withstand the test of time. I would probably have them run a lemonade stand or a small business and earn money so they can understand how that works. Have them work on something charitable-related, or take them to the third world and show them suffering, true suffering, so they can get some context. I\u2019d probably teach them public speaking, business writing, basic persuasion. Maybe a little bit of programming on top of the reading, writing, and arithmetic. I\u2019d probably eliminate chunks of geography, history, and honestly even second or third languages. Music, unless they had musical inclinations. I know this is going to horrify some people, but the question is, \u201cWhat do you emphasize?\u201d It\u2019s not initially good to educate every child in every thing. You have to find out, \u201cWhat is their aptitude?\u201d And what\u2019s more practical. We\u2019re now living in the Wikipedia era, the internet era. A lot of the factual memorization that used to go on is now completely irrelevant. You can just look it up. Those kinds of things need to go away. Think about the fact that if you have young children right now, or you\u2019re planning on having children that your children will probably not need to know how to drive a car. There\u2019re all kinds of time savings to be had. It can be used for these other things. The happiness one is a very complex topic. I actually don\u2019t think happiness is its own thing. I think a lot of what we think of happiness is is just pleasure. It\u2019s physical pleasure, either from, \u201cOh, that tasted good.\u201d Or it might be momentary pleasure from, \u201cHe loves me, she loves me.\u201d I think true happiness comes out of peace. Peace comes out of many things, but it comes from fundamentally understanding yourself. It comes from looking inside yourself and how much what you\u2019re reacting to are emotional reactions or attachment. Self-inflicted suffering. It\u2019s desire that you have for things that you probably shouldn\u2019t care that much about. There\u2019s a great line that my brother Kamal quoted in his book, he has a great book called, Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It and another one called Live Your Truth. He\u2019s the philosopher in the family; I\u2019m just the amateur. He had a great line in there where it said, \u201cI once asked a monk, \u2018What is your secret to peace and happiness?\u2019 And the monk said, \u2018I say \u2018Yes.\u2019 To everything that happens, I say \u2018Yes.\u201d\u201d That\u2019s very hard for us to imagine because in life we\u2019re used to fighting for everything. We\u2019re used to getting whatever we want. We\u2019re used to reacting. We\u2019re used to immediately saying, \u201cThat stinks. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s bad.\u201d We\u2019re used to constantly judging things. The act of judging something separates you from that thing. Over time, as you judge, judge, judge, you invariably judge people. You judge yourself. You separate yourself from everything, and then you end up lonely. That feeling of disconnection, loneliness, is eventually what leads to suffering. Then, you struggle. You resist against the way the world is. That\u2019s what your ego does. It helps you operate in the real world by resisting against things you don\u2019t like. That is a source of a lot of unhappiness. I actually think happiness is the absence of suffering. It comes from peace, and that comes from being very careful about that desire, judgment, reaction. Realizing that you don\u2019t actually need something anymore. That something is not important to you. To get very practical about it, I have a whole series of tricks that I use to try and be happier in the moment. At first, they were silly and difficult and required a lot of attention, but now some of them have become second nature. I think doing them religiously; I\u2019ve managed to increase my happiness level quite a bit. The obvious one is meditation, insight meditation. Working toward a specific purpose on it, which is to try and understand how my mind works. Then, just being very aware in every moment. If I catch myself judging somebody, then I can stop myself and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the positive interpretation of this?\u201d I used to get annoyed about things. Now I always look for the positive side of it. It used to take a rational effort. It used to take a few seconds for me to come up with a positive. Now I can do it sub-second. There are other hacks. Try to get more sunlight on my skin. Tell your friends that you\u2019re a happy person. Then you\u2019ll be forced to conform to it. You\u2019ll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person. These are little hacks. They add up over time. They\u2019re not going to pull you out of a severe depression. That\u2019s a much deeper more difficult thing, but if you\u2019re just trying to upgrade your happiness ever so slightly, you can do it. Another hack would be, just every time you catch yourself desiring something say, \u201cIs it so important to me that I be unhappy unless this goes my way?\u201d You\u2019re going to find with the vast majority of things it\u2019s just not true. I think dropping caffeine made me happier. Makes me more of a stable person. I think working out every day made me happier. If you have peace of body, it\u2019s easier to have peace of mind. There\u2019s lots and lots of things. This could be a full podcast, but I\u2019m still discovering and learning these things myself. It would be interesting to catalog these things, but I suspect that a lot of them are deeply, deeply personal. If I step back for a second and answer the question properly, the most important trick to be happy is to realize that happiness is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. It\u2019s just like building muscles. It\u2019s just like losing weight. It\u2019s just like succeeding at your job. It\u2019s just like learning calculus. You decide it\u2019s important to you. You prioritize it above everything else. You read everything on the topic. Again, I think the Buddhists have done a lot of good work on this. I don\u2019t think modern science has good answers here. I think that modern world is actually really bad. The modern world is full of distractions. Things like Twitter and Facebook are not making you happy. They are making you unhappy. You are essentially playing a game that\u2019s created by the creators of those systems, and yes, it can be a useful game once in a blue moon. You are engaging in the dispute, and resentment, comparison, jealousy, anger about things that frankly just don\u2019t matter. ARefinedMan asks, \u201cHow do you tend to handle conflict when it arises?\u201d I handle conflict very poorly. I get angry. I\u2019m an angry person, so I have to catch myself in the moment, and I have to talk myself down. I have to recognize the anger for what it is. I have to sense the bodily reactions, and then I have to see if I can stay calm. Usually, it\u2019s very hard for me. It\u2019s my nature to try to solve a problem the very moment it arises. I don\u2019t do well with long-term stress where there\u2019s an unsolved problem hanging out there. Probably the best single piece of advice I can give, other than just being mindful and aware, when you\u2019re engaging in conflict is not to associate with high-conflict people. We all know people in our lives who just tend to get a little more angry, a little more judgmental, or they\u2019re always in a fight with someone else. If you see someone who\u2019s always fighting with somebody else, they\u2019re eventually going to fight with you. I have slowly cut those people out of my life. Not in an overt, explicit way, but by hanging out with them less and less. There are plenty of smart, successful, kind, and happy people in the world. You just have to make space for them in your life, by letting the people who still have lessons to learn drift off and go learn their lessons. It\u2019s not your job to educate them. Sometimes very unhappy people have this air about them, kind of like a drowning person, where they\u2019re thrashing and making a big ruckus. Unless you\u2019re an extremely happy person yourself, you\u2019re going to drown too. I would say the first rule of handling conflict is, \u201cDon\u2019t hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict.\u201d \u201cWhat insight about life have you acquired that seems obvious to you, but might not be obvious to anyone else?\u201d This is a tough one. It\u2019s a deep question. I do have one fundamental recent belief that I\u2019ve acquired in the last few years that I don\u2019t think most people would agree with. It\u2019s such a personal thing, and it came about in such a personal circumstances that I\u2019m not sure anyone will get there in the same line of reasoning. That said, I\u2019ll lay it out anyway, which is, I\u2019m not afraid of death anymore. I think a lot of the struggle we have in life comes from a deep, deep fear of death. It can take form in many ways. One can be that we want to write the great American novel. We want to achieve something in this world. We want to build something. We want to build a great piece of technology, or we want to start an amazing business, or we want to run for office and make a difference. A lot of this comes from this fear that we\u2019re going to die, so we have to build something that lasts beyond us. Obviously, the obsession that parents have with their children. A lot of that is warranted biological love, but some of that is also the quest for immortality. Even some of the beliefs of some of the more outlandish parts of religion I think fall into that. I don\u2019t have the quest for immortality anymore. I think I came to this fundamental conclusion. I thought about it a lot. The universe has been around for a long time, and the universe is a very, very large place. If you\u2019ll study even the smallest bit of science, for all practical purposes we are nothing. We are ameba. We are bacteria to the universe. We\u2019re basically monkeys on a small rock orbiting a small backwards star in a huge galaxy, which is in an absolutely staggeringly gigantic universe, which itself may be part of a gigantic multiverse. This universe has been around probably for 10 billion years or more, and will be around for tens of billions of years afterwards. Your existence, my existence is just infinitesimal. It\u2019s like a firefly blinking once in the night. We\u2019re not really here that long, and we don\u2019t really matter that much. Nothing that we do lasts. Eventually, you will fade. Your works will fade. Your children will fade. Your thoughts will fade. These planets will fade. This sun will fade. It will all be gone. There are entire civilizations which we remember now with one or two words. Sumerian. Mayan. Do you know any Sumerians or Mayans? Do you hold any of them in high regard or esteem? Have they outlived their natural lifespan somehow? No. I think we\u2019re just here for an extremely short period of time. From here, you can choose to believe in an afterlife or not. If you really do believe in an afterlife, then that should give you comfort and make you realize that maybe everything that goes on in this life is not that consequential. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t believe in an afterlife, you should also come to a similar conclusion. You should realize that this is such a short and precious life that it\u2019s really important that you don\u2019t spend it being unhappy. There\u2019s no excuse for spending most of your life in misery. You\u2019ve only got 70 years out of the 50 billion or so that the universe is going to be around. Whatever your natural state is, it\u2019s probably not this. This is your living state. Your dead state is true over a much longer time frame. When I think about the world that way, I realize it\u2019s just kind of a game. Which is not to say that you go to a dark place, and you start acting unethically and immorally. Quite the contrary, you realize just how precious life is and how it\u2019s important to make sure that you enjoy yourself, you sleep well at night, you\u2019re a good moral person, you\u2019re generally happy, you take care of other people, you help out, but you can\u2019t take it too seriously. You can\u2019t get hung up over it. You can\u2019t make yourself miserable and unhappy over it. You just have a very short period of time here on this earth. Nothing you do is going to matter that much in the long run. Don\u2019t take yourself so seriously. That just kind of helps make everything else work. That\u2019s an insight about life that I\u2019ve acquired that now seems obvious to me, but it\u2019s really not obvious to most people. Related to that, [PretikStefen 00:28:17] asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s your philosophy of life or grand goal in living? In other words, of the things in life, you might pursue, which is the one you believe to be most valuable?\u201d Another great question. I think before, when I had the usual quest for immortality fear, that almost all of us do, that\u2019s coded into our genes, and that was driving me, I was trying to build lasting things, create things, make money, build businesses, write books, that sort of thing. Now, I realize a lot of that\u2019s meaningless. That\u2019s just stuff that keeps us busy. It\u2019s entertaining. It might have some social good. It might help build the moral character of human beings, but it\u2019s not really the purpose of life. Is there a purpose of life? That\u2019s tough. Is there a philosophy of life? That\u2019s tough. I think the closest I can articulate, and I\u2019ll probably change my mind on this next year is to keep growing and learning in the short period of time that you have. To seek truth and to accept things the way they are. To see the world the way it really is. Then, just to live your life. I think that\u2019s it. Any deeper meanings or goals just lead to ideologies, which lead to desires, and belief systems, and disappointments and conflict. It\u2019s better just to live the life that you have on this earth, enjoy it while you go. Try to see things the way they are, not the way you wish they were and to be in harmony with things the way that they are. Easier said than done. A number of people asked me what books I\u2019m reading now. This is a difficult question, because, at any given time, I\u2019m at probably about 50 books on my Kindle, and probably about six or seven hard-cover or soft-cover books that I\u2019m cycling through. I opened up my kindle. I look through. Based on my mood, I\u2019ll flip through to whatever book matches my mood. I\u2019ll flip to whatever part of it looks the most interesting, and I\u2019ll just read that part. I don\u2019t read in the sequential order. The most important thing that does for me is it lets me read on a regular basis. I can actually just pull up my kindle here, and I can read off the names of some of these books that I\u2019m reading. I can give you mini-reviews, but I haven\u2019t actually finished any of them. They\u2019re all in progress. At any given time, I\u2019m always reading some science fiction, because sci-fi is very imaginative, in terms of hypothesizing how the world\u2019s going to work out. Usually, it has an interesting point of view. You learn a little science. Just based on friends\u2019 recommendations, I\u2019ve been flipping through Greg Egan, brilliant writer. Physicist I believe, who has written some very hardcore sci-fi stories. I\u2019ve been reading a book from him called Distress. I\u2019ve always got collections of science fiction. I finished The Martian, which was decent, but I felt like it went on a little too long. I know it\u2019s a very popular book with some people. I love graphic novels. I\u2019ve been rereading The Boys, recently. Getting into the more evolution, science kind of books, Matt Ridley\u2019s The Evolution of Everything. I recommend everything by Matt Ridley. I think he\u2019s great. I really highly, highly recommend picking up Genome, The Red Queen, Origins of Virtue, The Rational Optimist, and The Evolution of Everything. I\u2019m reading The Essential Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi. Been reading, I\u2019ve got here The Tao Philosophy, by Alan Watts. I\u2019ve got Illusions, Richard Bach, which I read before, but I\u2019m flipping through again. I just like the way it flows. The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms, by Nassim Taleb, who is famous for The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness. I sort of like his collection of ancient wisdom, In the Bed of Procrustes. The Lessons of History by William Ariel Durant, which was actually recommended by one of the listeners in the first podcast. Great book. I really like how it summarizes some of the larger themes of history. Very incisive and, unlike most history books, is actually kind of small and it covers a lot of ground. I\u2019ve actually been reading my brother\u2019s book, How to Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It. I thought it was very succinctly written. Obviously a plug for my bro. I was reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, although I think I\u2019ll put that down. I get it. About half-way through it\u2019s just a giant drug-fueled orgy by Hunter S. Thompson and his friend. It was entertaining, but I sort of gave up after a bit. Richard Feynman, I\u2019ve been reading Perfectly Reasonable Deviations, and I\u2019ve also been rereading Genius. I\u2019m rereading The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell. Sometimes I think it\u2019s better to just to reread the greats than it is to read something that\u2019s not as great. In the philosophy side, I\u2019ve been rereading the Tao Te Ching, and I just finished Falling Into Grace by Adyashanti, which I thought was very good. Also, read some Jed McKenna recently. He\u2019s a weird one. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend him for everybody. God\u2019s Debris by Scott Adams, very interesting. The Origin of Consciousness: The Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. There\u2019s a mouthful for you, by Julian Jaynes. Mastering in the Core Teachings: The Buddha by Daniel Ingram. That\u2019s a great book. Recommended to me by a friend. It\u2019s available online. I would get that one. If you\u2019re interested in Buddhism, meditation, insight, I thought that one brought everything together, while leaving the mysticism out of it. That should give you the indication. I\u2019m always reading something by Krishnamurti. Usually, it\u2019s Total Freedom, which is the book that I just reread over and over again. Doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense, but when you\u2019re ready for it, there\u2019s nothing else like it. I also recently finished The Power of Habit, or close to finish as I get. That one was interesting, not because of its content necessarily, but because it\u2019s good for me to always keep on top of mind how powerful my habits are. Humans are basically habit machines. We form habits. We run on those habits all day long. Habits can be great because they help us get things done very efficiently without having to reprocess them all the time. They can also be terrible because we can have addictions. Those are the obvious bad habits. Also, they allow us to go through our life unconsciously and mindlessly. It\u2019s very important to be aware of your habits and know how to break habits and know how to make habits. I have this daily workout that I do that I think I mentioned in the last podcast. I think that specific one is interesting, but I think the specific technique matters less. The more important thing is just doing some kind of physical activity every single day. If you can, make it the same activity at the same time, because that will teach you the power of habits. If you do something seven days a week with no exceptions, and you work out early in the morning, or when you first get up, then it will automatically fix all kinds of other bad habits that you have. You can\u2019t be out drinking late at night. You can\u2019t be out partying. You can\u2019t consume too much caffeine. There are all kinds of other habits in your life that may be bad that get fixed if you stick to your daily workout habit. It teaches you what the power of a habit is. As you shed other bad habits, then you realize that habits can be broken, and you start breaking them. I think learning how to break habits is a very important meta-skill that can serve you better in life than almost anything else. Although you can read tons of books on it, the reality is you\u2019re never going to learn how to break bad habits until you just break them. One thing I try to do is I try to break a bad habit every six months, and I try and pick up a good habit every six months to year. You can\u2019t beat yourself up too much about on it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much on yourself to ask, \u201cIt\u2019s 2016, I\u2019m going to break one bad habit.\u201d I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to break that habit. Everything else will be static. I\u2019m not going to get any worse. That will help move the ball forward. Then you get gradual improvements in your life that you stick with. I used to be pretty overweight. I\u2019ve lost weight over the last decade, where now I feel I\u2019m pretty fit and healthy. It hasn\u2019t come through any single big epiphany or realization, but definitely going paleo helped. Understanding low-carb helped. Getting rid of processed food helped, and all those kinds of things. It mainly came from habit changes and changing habits slowly but steadily over the course of a decade. The good news is I\u2019ve almost never slid backward. I\u2019ve never felt in danger of regaining the weight I\u2019ve lost. Now, at the age of 42, I\u2019m probably within the lightest weight since I was an adult. I think that just comes from having stacked on a bunch of good habits and having gotten rid of a bunch of bad habits. I would say the power to make and break habits, learning how to do that, is really important. If you\u2019re going to leave this podcast, and you\u2019re going to pick up two skills in life- It depends on the person. Many of you. Tim\u2019s entire audience is a bunch of over-achievers. Many of you are way ahead of me on both of these, but for those of you who may be behind on one of them, I would say, first realize that happiness is a choice, and it is a skill, and you can dedicate to learning that skill and making that choice and telling people about it and working on it. You can slowly but steadily over the course of the years make yourself happier. Similarly, I would say that breaking habits is a skill, and it is something you can learn. Start with a small habit and try different techniques to break it. Try substituting. Try going cold turkey. Try weaning yourself off. Try social proof, by telling other people that you\u2019re going to break the habit. Try putting other habits around it that leave no time for that habit. Try removing the triggers. Try toning down the rewards. Do whatever it takes but break one bad habit this year. Once you pick up that skill, it\u2019s a beautiful thing, because slowly you can shed all your bad habits and make room for good habits in your life. BreakoutList says, \u201cWhat personal efficiency or life-management things do you do on a semi-regular basis? E.g., some kind of life review exercise where you rate certain categories, et cetera.\u201d The answer is none. I am lazy that way. I choose to live a spontaneous and free life. I don\u2019t want to live a very structured life. I know people who are married, and they actually have quarterly meetings with their wife. They have reports and \u201cHow are we performing as a marriage and what are our key results? What\u2019s our one-year plan? What\u2019s our five-year plan?\u201d I just don\u2019t plan. I\u2019m not a planner. I prefer to be free in the moment and flow and be happy. I think projecting too much in the future, judging yourself, setting yourself up in very difficult ways, other than as I talked about one habit or one desire. If you start trying to control yourself on a micro-basis, all you\u2019re going to do is make yourself miserable, and you\u2019re going to get nothing done. Just focus on the one or two really really important things, and everything else, just surrender to it. Just take it as it comes. Just accept it. Be glad with it. Be happy that you\u2019re in this world. Be glad that you\u2019re clothed and fed and that you\u2019re not getting bombs dropped on your head, like some people in the world are. I like to stay free because then I can see the little miracles in life. There are little miracles everywhere; it\u2019s just we have taken them for granted. The fact that you\u2019re wearing clothes. The fact that you have enough food to eat. The fact that you\u2019re in a place of shelter. Yes, you can roll your eyes about it. You can say, \u201cThat\u2019s obvious. Everybody has it.\u201d But actually, not everybody has it. It would be great to take a trip to a third-world country or to a refugee camp and see how little some other people have. I think it\u2019s a bad habit that we develop that we forget how to appreciate what we do have. Not obsessing about the future and not beating yourself up over what you don\u2019t have is very important, because then you can pay attention and be grateful for what you do have. Hephaestus2 asked for more book recommendations, especially any book recommended by the listeners in the last podcast that stood out and had an impact on your life. Yeah, the last podcast was a treasure trove in the comments section of good books. I recommended, and I got back even more great books. I must have bought at least 10 or 15 books just from the comments section. A couple that I read really stood out to me. I mentioned The Lessons of History. Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart, that was a fun, light read. The Prophet by Gibran, which I had never read, but it actually read like a modern-day poetic religious tome. Up there with the Bhagavad-gita, the Tao Te Ching, The Bible, The Qur\u2019an. It was written in that style where it had that feel of religiosity and truth, but it was very approachable and beautiful and non-denominational and non-secretarian. I really liked that. I loved that book. He has a gift for poetically describing what children are like, what lovers are like, what marriage should be like, how you should treat your enemies and your friends, how you should work with money, what can you think of every time you have to kill something to eat it. I felt, like the great religious books, it gave a very deep, very philosophical, but very true answer to how to approach the major problems in life. I recommend the prophet to anybody, whether you\u2019re religious or not. Whether you are Christian or Hindu or Jewish or Atheist. I think it\u2019s a beautiful book, and it\u2019s worth reading. Thank you to whoever recommended that one. Now I\u2019m going to switch gears for a second. The final section is podcasts. I\u2019m going to just focus on the questions that are very vocational focused. It\u2019s funny, I got a whole bunch of questions that say probably about two-thirds were about philosophy and life, and reading, and learning, and growth. Those are fun for me to answer because a new field for me myself. I learn from it too by talking about it and by hearing responses about it. There\u2019s a set of questions that are very particular about, \u201cHow do I make money?\u201d, \u201cHow do I become a good venture capitalist?\u201d, \u201cHow do I run my company?\u201d, etcetera. I\u2019ve been putting those off because those are sort of old hat, but I\u2019m going to answer those now in this section. Let me go through those. I know I covered a few of those before, but all the remaining ones from this point are very practical. If you are interested in the philosophical issues or the books, then we are done with that section. You can probably just stop the podcast. If you want to ever discus those topics, the best way to find me is on Twitter. You can find me as @Naval. I\u2019m usually reasonably responsive, as long as it\u2019s not too open-ended, it\u2019s kind of an interesting conversation. Let\u2019s dive right into it, the money-making questions. Vic Rush said, \u201cLet\u2019s assume that you\u2019re in your late 20s with no real money, college education. You decide to begin your journey with business new startups. What would you begin with? What would you do? Oh yeah, and you don\u2019t live in SF.\u201d Unfortunately, I\u2019d say, move to SF. If you can\u2019t move to SF, move to a startup hub. That could include, depending on where you are in the country, that could be Austin. That could be LA. That could be in New York. That could be in Boston. That could be Berlin. That could be London. It could be Bangalore. It could be Shanghai. It could be even parts of Deli or Beijing. Unfortunately, all the other people who are in startups are in these places, so you have to get in the flow. The good news is once you get in the flow, you\u2019re going to figure out, if you\u2019re motivated, what to do. You\u2019ll be able to go to a school where you can learn how to code. There are tons of them around. Tons of great academies like App Academy and Hack Reactor and General Assembly does classes where you can learn how to code. You can volunteer for startups. You can startup in maybe customer service, or you can start off in operations, just keeping the office running. Do whatever it takes, but get into the startup scene. Startups are a moved forward by people who are just willing to do the work. You don\u2019t necessarily be a genius or have a technical background if you\u2019re willing to do the work, and you\u2019re willing to learn, and you\u2019re in the right hub, you\u2019ll figure your way out within a couple of years. Duet14 says, \u201cYou studied computers and economics, how have these fields impacted your thinking? If you could go back, would you still pursue the same education, and why or why not?\u201d I would pursue similar. I would say that microeconomics was incredibly useful. Macroeconomics was mostly useless. The part of computer science that was very theoretical, like mathematics and algorithms, was actually the most useful because that stuff doesn\u2019t change over time. The part that was learning to program in Java or Fortran was useless or less useful because it fades over time. I would probably do more math, more physics, stick to micro-everything. I would probably have studied some psychology and some evolution because I think those are really important to understanding how humans work. At the end of the day, you\u2019re interacting with humans everywhere you go. I would have focused on theory and principles over facts. Facts fade or facts can be looked up. Your most important skill isn\u2019t even what you majored in or even what you studied, it\u2019s just knowing how to learn. If you have a good grasp of mathematics and if you like to read, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t learn on your own. BeTenthMan says, \u201cHey Naval, question from an 18-year-old in the Philippines. What advice would you give to ambitious 18-year-olds who want to be successful in founding startups and investing like you Naval?\u201d Basically, the question is, \u201cHow do I get as rich as you, but faster?\u201d Because nobody wants to put in the time. First of all, move to a startup hub, if you\u2019re going to be in that industry, or just go to the hub for whatever that industry is. If you want to be an actor, go to Hollywood. If you want to be on Broadway, go to New York. If you want to be finance, go to New York or London or Hong Kong. Second, I think Charlie Munger had a great answer to this. Charlie Munger is Warren Buffet\u2019s right-hand man, and he gets asked these kinds of things all the time. He\u2019s a self-made multi-billionaire and very wise in his ways. I think I\u2019m going to paraphrase and maybe mangle his answer, but you should look it up. He said, \u201cYou just get up early in the morning, you work really hard, you learn something every day, you put one foot in front of the other, and if you live long enough, eventually you will get what you deserve.\u201d That\u2019s it. There\u2019s no certainty in life. You can put in the hours, you can put in the time, but you can\u2019t really expect the outcome. Unfortunately, one of the things that investing has really taught me is just how much randomness there is in the world. How many times you think you can do something right, but it still doesn\u2019t work out. I often see that individual entrepreneurial efforts often fail, but individual entrepreneurs over their careers rarely fail. As long as you can keep taking shots on goal, and you keep getting back up, eventually you\u2019ll get through. Just stick at it. Although you might win early, that\u2019s rare. Those stories are very, very rare. People who tend to win early don\u2019t learn the right lessons. In fact, I made a small fortune when I was young, just by being in the right dot-come bubble company in 1999. Of course, I held on too long, and I lost the whole thing. That was a really good lesson because it meant that as I made a little bit of money later in life, now I knew how rare and precious it was, and I knew how to hang onto it. I didn\u2019t have the contempt for money that comes from making it too easily. I had a deep respect for how hard it is to make. Put in the hours. Pretik [Stefen 00:48:57] asks, \u201cWhat advice would you give a talented software engineer who is at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon? Should they continue to work there and get promoted, should they move to a startup like Airbnb, should they move to an early-stage startup, or should they bootstrap a software product, or should they found a startup and play the VC-funded game? And, is there a slight conflict of interest to would-be founders to investors?\u201d Yes, investors giving advice is always self-serving advice. Don\u2019t take your advice from investors if you can help it, because they have their particular view of the world and just realize that. Incentives are everything. Charlie Munger said incentives are everything. Incentives are superpowers. If you could be working on incentives, then you shouldn\u2019t be working on anything else. He means like in the context of your employees or within the context of your product. Incentives are everything. That said, what path should you take? I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re all good paths. It depends on what you want out of life. You could try them all. If you know you want to start a company, you know what the company is, you know who you want to do it with, and you feel like you have a good understanding of the space, then go do it. You\u2019re ready. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t yet know how to do it, or you don\u2019t know what it is, then you should probably get as close to it as possible. That would mean enjoying a startup. If you want to be a founder, you probably want to join a startup that\u2019s very early. If you\u2019re more interested in having a good lifestyle or making good money for your family, then you may want to go to a later-stage startup, the one that is more clearly on the path to success. Questions like this, unfortunately, don\u2019t have glib answers. It\u2019s highly, highly contextual. The fact that you\u2019re thinking about it means that you\u2019re going about it the right way. Startups are a young person\u2019s game. It\u2019s better to do them early in life before you settle down before you have too many obligations before you\u2019ve gotten set in your ways. If you\u2019re going to do a startup, you should at least take one shot at it before you\u2019re 30 or 35. After that, it gets a lot harder. That\u2019s just me personally. There are plenty of entrepreneurs who are executing in their 40s, and 50s, and 60s. I think T. Boone Pickens was still an entrepreneur and operator in his 80s or something like that. Here\u2019s a very practical question. \u201cWhat is your advice to those on US Visas? How can they go about launching a startup in the Valley while keeping their primary job in the short-term? What communities and incubators can they reach out to for help and advice?\u201d There\u2019s a great accelerator and incubator that I\u2019m a small investor in called Unshackled. I think they\u2019re at Unshackled.co. They solve exactly this problem. They help great engineers, designers, entrepreneurs start companies while retaining their visa status. They have a way to work that out that\u2019s perfectly legal and ethical and good. It helps immigrants create jobs, and create wealth, and create products for the rest of us. I highly recommend checking out Unshackled. There may be others like it; that\u2019s just the one that I happen to be aware of. Trail of Vinny, asks a good question. \u201cIn a world in which the majority of people will regard money much more than time, how do you protect your own time and still not offend people in both professional relationships and personally? Any strategies or good reads on this you would suggest?\u201d This is the bane of my existence. I get hit up for coffees, meetings, luncheons, obligations, to-dos, phone calls. For a little while, I was a little ornery about it. I used to own the domain, \u201cidontdocoffee.com\u201d and I would reply from Naval@idontdocoffee.com, but that was rude, and petulant, and stupid. That was the younger and more brash version of me. These days I\u2019ve become a master at evading meetings that suck up time. The reality is time is all you have in this world. When you\u2019re young, you\u2019re seeking out opportunities, so you look forward to serendipity. You\u2019re taking new meetings; dynamic is energizing you meeting new people. As you get older, you\u2019re too much opportunity, you\u2019re too many people, you have too much family obligations, you have too many things to do, too many places you could be. You just end up busy, busy, busy, busy, busy. Busy is a death of productivity and happiness. Derek Sivers, who I think Tim had a great podcast with said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say yes or no, I\u2019m going to say \u2018Hell yes\u2019 or \u2018No.'\u201d If I\u2019m not excited about something, I\u2019m not going to do it. I think that\u2019s a good heuristic to try out. So what if it offends people? You have a very short life on this earth. You have to spend it being happy, doing what is productive, and what matters with the people closest to you. I think all the greatness in life comes from compound interest, whether it\u2019s in investments or it\u2019s in relationships. My most popular tweet of all time is this one that\u2019s kind of glib, but it\u2019s, \u201cIf you can\u2019t see yourself working with somebody for life, don\u2019t work with them for a day.\u201d Now, of course, you\u2019re not going to say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to work with you, because I\u2019m not working with you for the rest of my life.\u201d But, it\u2019s a good reminder that any relationship is short-term or temporary, it\u2019s really not going to pay out the dividends that you want later in life. It\u2019s better to treat a lot of your time as a search function, where you\u2019re searching through the set of jobs, you\u2019re searching through the set of dates and spouses. You\u2019re searching through the set of hobbies until you find something things you love. When you find things and people that you love, you go all-in on them. When you find the person that you love being around 24/7, and if they\u2019re attractive and of the opposite sex, you\u2019d marry them. If there\u2019re friends that you never get tired of hanging around with, those are going to be the three, four, five friends that you spend most of your rest of your life with. Hopefully, they\u2019re happy people because it\u2019ll rub off on you. There\u2019s a theory called the five chimps theory. Where you can, in zoology, predict the mood, behavior patterns of any chimp by which five chimps they hang out the most with. Choose your five chimps carefully. I would say, yes people can get offended. It can damage relationships if you blow them off, or if you\u2019re non-responsive. You have very little room in your life long-term for real relationships. Guard that time. It\u2019s actually really important to have empty space. If you don\u2019t have a day or two days a week in your calendar where you\u2019re not always in meetings, and you\u2019re not always busy, then you\u2019re not going to be able to think. You\u2019re not going to be able to have good ideas for your business. You\u2019re not going to be able to make good judgments. I also encourage taking at least one day a week preferably two, because if you budget two, you\u2019ll end up with one. A day our two on your calendar where you just have time to think. It\u2019s only after you\u2019re bored that you have the great ideas. It\u2019s never going to be when you\u2019re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. Same way with people, you need to have time space in your life where you\u2019re not booked with the people that you already know. This way, once in a blue moon, an invitation will come along, and a person will come into your life that\u2019s suddenly really interesting. I think you have to be pretty ruthless about saying no to things, about turning people down, and about leaving room in your life for serendipity. My experience, normally, if you don\u2019t make time for people when they\u2019re requesting time for you, yes it\u2019s a little painful, it\u2019s a little socially awkward, but the people aren\u2019t going to disrespect you. If anything they want to hang out with you even more, because they realize you\u2019re very discriminating with your time. Guard your time. Forget the money. Money is actually the least important thing. The discount rate to money, I like asking my friend, \u201cIf you could keep your friends and family, and you keep everything you know, but you lost all your money and your job, and you had to start over. In exchange, you get to be younger, physically younger. How many years of your life would you have to get back in exchange for giving up everything you\u2019ve earned and put away.\u201d I\u2019ve had friends say five years or ten years. For me personally, it\u2019s about two to three years. If you gave me back two or three years of youth, frankly. The older you get, the smaller that number gets. When you\u2019re on your death bed, when you\u2019re on your last day, you\u2019d give up every dollar in the bank for a few days, another hour, another minute. Money has a very steep discount rate as you get older. You just realize as you get older that it matters less and less and less. Outside of the bare necessities, which unfortunately most of the world is still struggling with.
