"num_sentences": 1592, "num_words": 20022, "raw_text": "Tim Ferriss: Why hello, boys and girls, you frisky little squirrels. This is Tim Ferriss, welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, and yes, I\u2019ve a little bit of caffeine this morning, and I\u2019m feeling great, thank you for asking. This show is about deconstructing world-class performers of all different types. That can range of entertainment to chess to military to entrepreneurship, billionaires \u2013 the Big B Club, those guys, pretty interesting cats \u2013 and all over the show. As they say, across the pond, athletes, you name it. The guest today is, I would say, a combination of almost all of that \u2013 John Crowley. You will have to listen to his story to believe it. We\u2019re going to get really deep into a lot of the details. It is moving, it is incredible, it is hard to believe, it is miraculous, it is all of the above. I call John, who\u2019s been a friend for a long time now, the real-life Captain America. That\u2019s not just a label that I use. So, the real-life Captain America, but he\u2019s also, the real-life Bruce Banner, so, allow me to explain. John Crowley \u2013 what does his bio sound like? He\u2019s the Chairman and CEO of Amicus Therapeutics, a publicly traded biotechnology company, which he helped to found in 2005, and which is now a 300+ person company in 22 countries. Okay, that is the current day. But his involvement with biotech stems from the 1998 diagnosis of two of his children with Pompe disease. He was surprised with this unexpected diagnosis of a severe and often fatal neuromuscular disorder. In his drive to find a cure for them, he left his job at the time, became an entrepreneur, then became the co-founder and president and CEO of Novazyme Pharmaceuticals in 2000, a startup conducting research on a new, experimental treatment for Pompe disease, which he credits as ultimately saving his children\u2019s lives. In 2001, Novazyme was acquired by Genzyme Corporation for nearly $200 million. John and his family have been profiled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and are the subjects of a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Geeta Anand. The title is The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million \u2013 and Bucked the Medical Establishment \u2013 in a Quest to Save His Children, which he did. A major motion picture was made out of that or based on that, the story called Extraordinary Measures starring Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford. John is the author also, of a memoir called Chasing Miracles: The Crowley Family Journey of Strength, Hope and Joy. But that\u2019s not all. That is just the tip of the iceberg, folks. John also, served as a commissioned intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve from 2005 to 2016. He was assigned to the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC. For those of you who have listened to my episode with retired Four-Star General, Stanley McChrystal, you\u2019ll be familiar with JSOC. He is a veteran of the global war on terrorism with service in Afghanistan. He graduated with a B.S. in Foreign Service from Georgetown and earned a J.D. from the University of Notre Dame Law School and an MBA from Harvard. He previously served for two years, 2014-2016, as the National Chairman of the Make-a-Wish Foundation of America and is a founding Board member of the Global Genes Project. John is a Henry Crown Fellow at the Aspen Institute, which is where I met him. I was also, a Henry Crown Fellow and ended up in his class. This guy is amazing. I am constantly impressed. He is jacked, ripped, intelligent, effective, has perfect hair \u2013 which I\u2019m of course very jealous of; we\u2019ll get into that \u2013 so, please enjoy my very moving, very powerful and very wide-ranging conversation with the one and only, John Crowley. John, welcome to the show. John Crowley: Tim, great to be here. Tim Ferriss: It is so, great to see you. John Crowley: Yes, my friend. Tim Ferriss: Every time I see you, I think your shoulders have grown larger. Bursting out of \u2013 John Crowley: At 49 years old, I assure you it\u2019s an illusion now. Tim Ferriss: You just have to start shopping at Gap Kids. That\u2019s what I do whenever I want to look huge. I thought we could start \u2013 we were chatting a little bit before we started recording. You were educating me about fast-roping drills and making my hands sweat. Could you please explain? I said, you know what? Actually pause. Let\u2019s talk about this. Let me record. Can you re-tell what you were describing to me, please? John Crowley: Yeah, and if you remember, this came up in the context of describing fears of heights. I said despite having served in the military and worked with some amazing people and done some things that I probably shouldn\u2019t have ever been doing, at least at that age, we talked about fast-roping. So, with a fear of heights, I was being trained with a Navy intelligence officer working with a SEAL team, so, I had the Navy SEALs teaching me how to fast-rope. Okay, great. They give you the basics and then you go up in this tower. So, we end up going up. You climb up these ladders 40 feet. Then there\u2019s a plank and there\u2019s a real salty-looking seal, Chief Petty Officer, handing the rope. It\u2019s a really uneasy feeling to step out on a plank and grab a rope, even though you think you\u2019re strong enough to hold it and you know the basics and can kind of slide your way down. Just that thought of \u201cmy life is now literally in my hands, literally.\u201d Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re untethered? John Crowley: You are untethered. You step out on a rope off away from the platform, you grab the rope and you slide down fast. And it better be fast because the next guy is above you and if you go too slow, he\u2019s going to come crashing down on you. So, you\u2019re terrified. You do it, so, I do it. Tim Ferriss: And 40 feet, I mean, if you fall, and I\u2019m sure people do fall. John Crowley: Well, it\u2019s a long way up. Tim Ferriss: I was talking to a friend of mine I won\u2019t mention by name, but he was practicing with the West Coast SEALs and he was telling me about accidents on ropes courses. [Inaudible] fall. John Crowley: Oh sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So, you do the 40 feet. John Crowley: You do it once, then you do it three times. It\u2019s quick evolution. You finish, they check the box. Training certified at 40 feet. Okay. So, you think you\u2019ve accomplished something. And then Chief Petty Officer, Chief says, \u201cAll right. We\u2019re going up.\u201d So, then you climb up to 90 feet. That\u2019s a long way up. Now you\u2019re looking at a plank and they\u2019re just handing you a rope. I\u2019m hesitating and I\u2019m thinking, I can\u2019t hesitate or it\u2019s \u2013 this isn\u2019t what you do in the special operations world, of course, and I don\u2019t want this Chief Petty Officer SEAL getting all angry with me. So, he hands it to me, so, I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019ve got to come up with something to say to try to defer this, at least a few moments. So, I said, \u201cChief? Quick question.\u201d I said, \u201cAny difference between up here versus down there?\u201d 90 feet versus 40 feet. Of course, I meant difference in technique. I was just trying to make conversation at that point. He says, \u201cOh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.\u201d I said, \u201cChief, what is it?\u201d With all of his wisdom he said, \u201cIf you fall down there, you get an open casket.\u201d He hands it to me and he goes, \u201cGo!\u201d Tim Ferriss: Thanks, coach. John Crowley: Yeah, thanks. And thankfully, of course, I survived. I had great teachers. Tim Ferriss: Good God. I mean, we were discussing a number of things. Everything is fine. It\u2019s safe as long as you remain calm. John Crowley: Like most things in life. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s how a lot of dangerous things can be presented when we start talking about Man on a Wire, which is how this came up. You can look at my hands. I don\u2019t know what it says about me. Maybe I\u2019m bad at thermal regulations, but I\u2019m just pouring sweat. I\u2019m very sensitive to heights. That\u2019s part of the reason I took up bouldering and belay rock climbing some time ago, to try to therapeutically fix that. I haven\u2019t yet succeeded. John Crowley: I was going to say, how did that work? Tim Ferriss: It actually helped quite a bit. I just had to use copious amounts of chalk. It addressed my perception of danger, but it did not affect the hand sweating. So, I just used disgusting amounts of chalk, which is true when I deadlift too. Maybe I just sweat a lot in general. Let\u2019s start way back, in the beginning. I love speaking with my friends in this somewhat unnatural interview format because I get to do the 20 questions that would seem so, odd if I did it at dinner or something like that. John Crowley: Sure, sure. Or that I wouldn\u2019t answer if you did. Tim Ferriss: Or that you wouldn\u2019t answer, right. So, now compelled by the recorder in front of us, what was your childhood like? Could you describe your family and upbringing? John Crowley: Sure. I grew up in northern New Jersey. My Mom\u2019s family was from Italy. My Dad\u2019s family was from Ireland. They were both first generation. They met when they were young and I was born in 1967. My Dad had served in the Marines and was a cop in northern New Jersey. We lived in Englewood, New Jersey. Just right by the George Washington Bridge. From what I remember of the early years, it was pretty nice, fun. We lived in small, little garden apartments. In these garden apartments, my Dad\u2019s brother lived, who was also, a cop. My Grandfather, the Italian from Naples, was the Superintendent of the apartments. All my cousins lived there. It was kind of like a commune, if you were, for the family. Things were good, but there are those things in life that change you or have an impact. For me, it was in January 1975, when I woke up one morning and learned that my Dad who was a copy, my hero, had died on duty the night before. He was killed in a tragic car accident. It was Super Bowl Sunday. Life changes a lot. By that point, we very quickly moved in with my grandparents, who lived the next town over. We had a 900-square foot home that my Grandfather built after World War II, two bedroom, one bath. Grandma, Grandpa, and my then-20-or-so-year-old Aunt in one bedroom. And me, Mom and my then-4-year-old brother, I was 7, in the other bedroom, right after Dad died. Things change you. I think it was surrounded by lots of love. I think what my Mom did to keep us together, what my grandparents did, everybody, what the police community did for us, was really remarkable. Those are things you never forget. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m so, ashamed that I somehow didn\u2019t know that. I feel like I should\u2019ve known that and I didn\u2019t. How is that, if it has, I can\u2019t imagine that it hasn\u2019t, affect the person you are today? How did that change you? John Crowley: Obviously, you miss your Dad a lot. But I think it forces you to grow up really fast, Tim. For me, it really, I think, was two lessons. One, that a lot of people may rely on you in life. For me, it was my then-4-year-old brother. Even my Mom, in a way. She had to go to work. She went to work. She\u2019d been a professional administrative assistant earlier in life, then was raising us. Then she had to become a waitress in northern New Jersey. A lot of people I realized at an early age, may rely on me for whatever that may be. That was one really important lesson. No. 2 is it\u2019s okay to rely on others. It\u2019s okay to ask for help. We did, I did a lot. Those things change and you move on. [Inaudible] you realize you\u2019ve got to be independent. The world is full of setbacks. I had a friend years ago, whose dad once told me, \u201cLife is a series of challenges and your happiness in life is directly related to how well you deal with those challenges.\u201d That was one really big challenge really early on. Tim Ferriss: So, we \u2013 I think this is going to be a recurring theme that we\u2019ll come back to quite a bit in this conversation. But before we go down that route, what were your strengths and weaknesses as a kid or quirks? I have this picture of like a mini-Captain America. Does that sound correct? John Crowley: Really mini. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s how I think of you. John Crowley: I never got past 5\u20196\u201d. Tim Ferriss: But what were you like at say 10 years of age? What were your strengths, weaknesses, or any defining behaviors, characteristics? Good student, bad student? John Crowley: Yeah, I was a good student. I worked hard. I learned early on in life to study is a road to success. My grandfather didn\u2019t finish the seventh grade. Even before my dad died, I would spend a lot of time with him. Have you ever been to Fort Lee, New Jersey, and you see those big apartment buildings that rise across the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey? Tim Ferriss: Sure. John Crowley: When I was a little kid, they weren\u2019t there; that was an amusement park, Palisades Amusement Park. Once of the first buildings that went up, my grandfather was a superintendent. He was a handyman, he could fix anything. But my Mom was working and somebody had to watch me. I was, I don\u2019t know, 4 or 5 years old. I used to go to those apartment buildings with my Grandpa. He\u2019d show up with his toolbox and I\u2019d say, \u201cGrandpa, I want a toolbox, too.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, absolutely.\u201d He gave me a toolbox with a couple of real tools in it and I\u2019d go around with him all day long and he\u2019d be fixing dishwashers or door jambs or whatever. I\u2019d bang a hammer and try to help because boy, I said, \u201cGrandpa, I want either do this or I want to be a cop like Dad.\u201d What Grandpa did and I didn\u2019t realize it until many years after, was over the course of that year, he would slowly take the tools out of the toolbox and put books in. After I got bored with swinging a hammer and when I realized, even at 4 or 5 five years old, I wasn\u2019t very good at swinging a hammer, I\u2019d just start reading the books. I tried to be a good student. I think I was a pretty decent student. Again, a lot of good teachers along the way. I tried to be an athlete and I was a perfectly mediocre athlete. Good enough usually to make the team, and never nearly good enough to stand out on it. Tim Ferriss: What were your sports? John Crowley: I played baseball and by high school, I wrestled as well. Sports that a guy who\u2019s 5\u20196\u201d and 155 pounds as an adult could play as a kid. Football I played. I think in fourth grade I went out and made the football team. I started out as a lineman. I was about average size maybe in fourth grade. Then everybody kept growing and I wasn\u2019t growing quite as fast as everybody. So, by fifth, sixth grade I was a linebacker. Then I was a running back. Then I was a free safety. And by ninth grade, I went to Bergen Catholic High School in New Jersey, football powerhouse. My sophomore year in high school, they were ranked No. 2 in the nation. Freshman year, I\u2019m going out for the football team. That lasted about five days. I realized I love football, but this is not a sport in which I should participate safely. No matter how calm I tried to be, I should not participate. You\u2019re looking at a decent student and mediocre athlete. I always tried to \u2013 friends always made fun of me. I always seemed to have the hair kind of parted and combed right. Tim Ferriss: You still do. John Crowley: Well, it\u2019s funny. My daughter, Megan, pointed that out over Christmas. I don\u2019t know \u2013 we were talking about something or other and it was really windy. I came in and she goes, \u201cOhmygod, it can move.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d She goes, \u201cYour hair.\u201d She said, \u201cI was told it hadn\u2019t moved since 1968.\u201d So, thanks, Meg, that was very thoughtful. Tim Ferriss: I only wish I could have perfectly parted hair. Alas, my options are limited these days. Jason Statham or bust is sort of my motto for styling. What did you think you were going to be in high school, when you grew up? What did you think you were going to be? Or hoped to be? John Crowley: I always had been focused on the military. I think with my Dad being in the Marines and my uncle in the Navy and their being police officers, there was always that sense of patriotism and responsibility and wanting to serve the country. I spent a fair amount of time thinking about going in the military in high school. I also, thought about being a lawyer, even in high school. Tim Ferriss: How did you decide on college? Actually, before I get to college, did you have any particular \u2013 I\u2019ll ask the same question for college, so, if you want to just skip ahead you can do that \u2013 did you have any particularly impactful mentors or people who left a mark on you in those high school years? John Crowley: Yeah, you know what? So, I went to Bergen Catholic High School. It\u2019s taught by the Christian Brothers. They were founded in Ireland. The Irish Christian Brothers. They\u2019re a good order. I think they taught us well. I really can\u2019t point to any one particular person in high school. I think in terms of a mentor, somebody who taught me about life, for a male role model, it would certainly be my grandfather. Tim Ferriss: How did you choose where to attend college or how did you end up attending the school you did? John Crowley: I actually spent the first couple of years of college at the Naval Academy. I got an appointment from our Senators and that kind of took me on the course in the military. Then again, we make our plans and God laughs. So, I got to my second year of the Naval Academy. After the first year, you go through the physical and they actually check the box. I couldn\u2019t \u2013 my eyes weren\u2019t 20/20 \u2013 check the box not qualified to fly. Because by then, at 18, 19 years old, I was going to be the world\u2019s greatest F14 pilot. Then boy, that was a real setback. I was thinking I was going to do this, now I can\u2019t do it. Well, maybe I\u2019ll be a Marine out of the Naval Academy or something else. Then I just started to think about was that the right fit for me in the 19-year-old struggling. I finally made the decision that I was going to voluntarily resign from the Naval Academy. It took me months to come to that decision. By that point, I\u2019d been accepted to the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown and loved the academics, the curriculum. Aileen was also, then in college. She was my high school girlfriend and now wife. The thought of living in Washington was attractive. And I did, with a good degree of hesitation, signed that letter of resignation. I did put in that letter that someday I would like to wear a uniform again and someday I would like the honor to serve our country. I left it at that in whenever that was, 1987 or so. I went to Georgetown and finished Georgetown. Tim Ferriss: What did you study at Georgetown? John Crowley: I was in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to plead ignorance here. I should know what that entails and I just don\u2019t. What\u2019s the curriculum? What is done at such a place? It\u2019s one of the four or so, college at Georgetown. Bill Clinton graduated from the School of Foreign Service many years before me. SFS stands for School of Foreign Service. We used to say it stood for Safe From Science. It had no math and no science requirements. Years back, it was a school set up to train diplomats. It\u2019s since become a liberal arts college with a strong emphasis on international relations. I majored in international economics. An excellent program. I had phenomenal teachers; people like Madeleine Albright, Jeane Kirkpatrick, William Colby, who had been Director of the CIA. Remarkable people, great school. Then from there, I thought maybe I will be a lawyer after all and applied to law schools. I was accepted to a couple. One of which was the University of Notre Dame. I\u2019d thought about Notre Dame as a college, but Naval Academy trumped it and then Georgetown for a whole bunch of reasons made sense. I\u2019ll share this with you. I\u2019d talked about my Dad passing away. The first time I ever watched \u2013 so, people think Notre Dame and they think college football or sports. And yeah, we have great sports and athletics programs at Notre Dame and certainly great academics. I didn\u2019t know anything about Notre Dame beyond that. As a little kid, the first time I ever watched a football game, I was 7 years old. My Dad said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to watch a football game.\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I don\u2019t want to watch a football game.\u201d He goes, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s Notre Dame.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWatch.\u201d My Dad was one of the subway alums, meaning he never went to Notre Dame, never went to college, never even went to South Bend, Indiana, but he just loved the school, loved the spirit of tradition and all that. So, I kind of whined and complained and I watched it. It was the Sugar Bowl. 1975, Notre Dame versus Alabama. So, we\u2019re watching this game and all of a sudden, I\u2019m cheering. By the end of it, I\u2019m totally taken in with the mystique of Notre Dame and the gold helmets. I just loved these gold helmets. Notre Dame wins the game, 13-11 over \u2018Bama. I said to my Dad, I said, \u201cDad, this is great.\u201d He smiled and said, \u201cYeah, never forget this.\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I want one of those gold helmets.\u201d He said, \u201cTomorrow we\u2019re going to Sears in Hackensack, New Jersey, and we\u2019re going to get the gold helmets.\u201d Great. So, we go the next day, go to the football section in the athletic department there and I\u2019m looking, \u201cDad, there\u2019s no gold helmet.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no. This is how you do it.\u201d So, he takes a generic helmet off the shelf, goes to the hardware section, gets a can of gold spray paint and he says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to spray paint it. That\u2019s how you make a Notre Dame helmet.\u201d So, we go home, we spray paint it together and I had my Notre Dame helmet. That was January 2nd, 1975. My Dad died 10 days later. Tim Ferriss: Ohmygod. John Crowley: I still have that helmet, Tim. That memory and the affection, affinity, respect for a place like Notre Dame carried with me. I came down I had a couple of schools to choose from; Notre Dame was one of them. I\u2019d never been to South Bend. I didn\u2019t have the money to go visit by the end of college, literally. So, I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s now or never.\u201d So, I checked the box, sent in $100.00 deposit, and said, \u201cwell, I\u2019m going to Notre Dame Law School,\u201d and I did. Tim Ferriss: I should point out also, that your fondness for Notre Dame extends to our selection of cable colors for today\u2019s interview. John Crowley: I have a blue shirt on. You asked do I want green, orange or yellow. I said, \u201cWell, yellow looks like gold. I\u2019ll take blue and gold.\u201d Now I\u2019ve really got to love Notre Dame. My daughter, Megan, is a sophomore there. We\u2019ll talk more about Megan in a little bit. So, it was great. I practiced law for a few years after that at a great firm in Indianapolis. I get bored sometimes real easily with things. Tim Ferriss: What type of law were you practicing? John Crowley: I was a litigator; I was a trial attorney. I did that for a couple of years. Great people, great firm. I was just kind of itching for something else. On a lark, I applied to business school and the people up at Harvard \u2013 I still think it was a clerical error \u2013 but they accepted us. We were married, Aileen and I. We had a 1-year old, a nice house, nice life in Indianapolis. We picked it all up to move to Boston. It was one of the best decisions we ever made. Tim Ferriss: Why was it such a good decision? John Crowley: We made some of the greatest friends that we still have today. What was neat about the business school up there \u2013 what\u2019s, I think, very different about business versus law \u2013 in terms of the education, we spent a lot of time on understanding through the case study method, of course, in business school, how do businesses really work. At least as best as you can in a case study. Tim Ferriss: Can you describe that? Because I had a professor at Princeton, Ed Zschau, who had a huge impact. John Crowley: Ed\u2019s great, wonderful. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Ed, for those people who don\u2019t know the name, he is just a phenomenal human being and a very eclectic character, which I love. Former competitive figure skater, former Congressman, took at least one company, I think a few companies, public. He was the first computer science professor at Stanford, I believe, because somebody didn\u2019t show up to teach it. He said, sure, I\u2019ll figure out how to teach that course. He taught a class at Princeton in high-tech entrepreneurship after leaving Harvard Business School. He used the case study method. Am I saying that correctly? Could you section what that looks like in practice? John Crowley: Right, so, you show up at most colleges, most schools, what do you do? You go get all your textbooks, right? At HBS, our first year at the business school, we didn\u2019t have any textbooks. You instead go to the case distribution office. I don\u2019t know how they do it now, but 20 years ago, every class was one case. In your course of two-year study, you will do 800 case studies. I\u2019ll give an example. First day, first class, it was technology and operations management. Kind of a tech-ops, manufacturing-type course. Having been a lawyer and spent most of my life avoiding math and science, I get this case. I\u2019m like, all right, I\u2019ve got to do this. I\u2019ve got to get it together. It was a case called Donner Drilling. I\u2019ll never forget about it. A company manufacturing widgets or whatever they\u2019re making. We had to calculate the optimum through-put for manufacturing for the most cost-effective and efficient manufacturing process. I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m like, this is real business. This is what I came here for. I\u2019m looking at it and the first thing I look, ohmygod, I\u2019m looking at the math that I\u2019ve got to do on this. You study this and it\u2019s real life. It\u2019s an actual case study that a professor, usually with a research assistant, has gone out and interviewed the businessperson, entrepreneur, and taken the issue that they had and distilled it down to a case study for students. Now you prepare. You go into the class. 80 of us, first-year section. Steve Wheelwright \u2013 never forget the name \u2013 great guy, professor out there, the Dean of the MBA program is teaching it. Just a legend at HBS. Brilliant man. What they do is they begin with a cold call. You don\u2019t know \u2013 somebody\u2019s going to get called on. But unlike in law school, it\u2019s not a quick give and take and multiple cold calls. Every class, one person is selected randomly to begin the case and for a good 20 minutes, lay it out before the class then participates. One of the great things about business school, especially how they taught it up at HBS is the students are, in many ways, teaching each other. It\u2019s a discussion. I get, of course, first class, first case, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have start us off, John Crowley. John, are you here?\u201d I\u2019m in the top deck and like, oh god. \u201cProfessor, yes, I\u2019m here.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cJohn, what do you think Donner Drilling should do?\u201d So, I start laying out a strategy, a plan and he\u2019s up there. Now I\u2019ve got to get to the math. So, the equation \u2013 he\u2019s putting it all up there on the board. He\u2019s laying it out. It just makes no sense, whatever. He\u2019s a nice guy, very patient. He starts looking back at me in the class, \u201cUh, okay.\u201d And whenever a professor says, \u201cUh, okay,\u201d you\u2019re probably not going down the right path. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not okay. John Crowley: So, then finally he starts writing the equations I\u2019m giving him down. Then he just puts the chalk down and turns around and just looks at me. Then I just looked at him and it was this kind of awkward moment. He just smiles in kind of a fatherly way and I just said, \u201cWell, Professor, when I applied, I was told there would be no math.\u201d There\u2019s this awkward moment. I\u2019m like, nobody\u2019s laughing. Then everybody burst out. It really diffused the tension, but it\u2019s a great way to learn. Oftentimes we\u2019d have the real executives or entrepreneurs in the class to teach us. A couple of years after I graduated, they actually wrote an HBS case story about our journey in life. It\u2019s called \u201cA Father\u2019s Love.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s jump into that. We can fill in gaps if and as needed. What does that case study cover? Why did they do a case study? John Crowley: I graduated business school then in 1997. But that point, our son, John, was about three years old. Our daughter, Megan \u2013 well, John was actually two and a half. Megan was six months old. So, we had Megan while we were in business school. About six months after we graduated, we realized by a year of age, Megan \u2013 we had moved out here to the Bay area in California. Life was great. I had a lot of student loans, but we had a great job, we had a life and this is starting the American dream, if you will. Tim Ferriss: What were you doing for work at the time? John Crowley: I worked with a consulting firm out here in the Bay area. Doing business strategy, consulting, a lot of hours. But great people and it was what I signed up for. What we didn\u2019t sign up for was, by a year of age, we realized our daughter, Megan, who was born seemingly perfectly healthy, born at Boston at the Brigham, wasn\u2019t doing the things that a kid typically does by 9 or 12 months of age. She wasn\u2019t pulling up in the crib. She wasn\u2019t taking her first steps. So, from pediatrician to neurologist to next neurologist, to blood work, to biopsies. By this point, early 1998, Aileen is pregnant with our third child, Patrick. Patrick is born March 6, 1998. Seven days later, we were asked to come to the neurologist\u2019s office at Oakland Children\u2019s Hospital across the Bay here. We\u2019re told all the tests came back on Megan, who was then 15 months old, and that she had a rare neuromuscular disease called Pompe disease. I\u2019d never heard of it. There\u2019s no history of it in the family. Aileen and I were silent carriers. Anything person is a carrier, generally, for maybe a dozen or so, serious genetic diseases but it doesn\u2019t manifest until you happen to make a baby with somebody else who has that. Even then, oftentimes, just a one in four chance. So, no health history in our families. Then I asked the doctor, \u201cIs it serious?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s very serious.\u201d His hands are shaking and he\u2019s basically reading a textbook to us describing the disease. He tells us Megan has a genetic defect where she can\u2019t make a certain enzyme and without that enzyme, she can\u2019t break down glycogen stored in the muscle. Which, as you know, is stored until it\u2019s converted to glucose and used as muscle energy. Because of that, it\u2019s ravaging her muscles and now we\u2019re just in shock. Then I said, \u201cDoc, how serious?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll live another year.\u201d Then he said \u2013 we had Patrick with us. He was seven days old. He was in a car carrier. He said, \u201cAnd your son, Patrick, should be tested too. There\u2019s a 25 percent chance he may have the disease as well.\u201d I\u2019ve got to tell you, Tim, we went through that car ride home \u2013 we were living in Walnut Creek near Oakland at the time \u2013 just in stunned silence. We then, even just that night, we went through \u2013 walking through the door at the house, seeing Megan sitting there in her high chair, I couldn\u2019t even look at her. We went through that night, the shock, the grief, the denial, a lot of tears. Then Aileen went to bed and I stayed up late. Google wasn\u2019t even around, but I did some internet searching. I found that there was a doctor at Duke University. There was a little bit of research being done. In fact, he had just published a month earlier a paper showing that he could correct the disease in some animal models of the disease. I was so, excited and I woke Aileen up. I\u2019m explaining, I\u2019m rattling off this science. I didn\u2019t know anything about science. She looked at me like \u201cWhat are you even talking about? What does it mean?\u201d I said, \u201cI think, Aileen, it means there may be some hope.\u201d That was a long day. It was a Friday the 13th. I\u2019ll never forget. Tim Ferriss: I cannot even imagine. That is \u2013 it sounds like the longest of days. John Crowley: It was the start of many long days, yes. But it was a long day. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t want to interrupt. Why don\u2019t you tell us the story in a way that makes sense to you to tell it? Of course, this is something that what follows as well has been turned into a book. It has been turned into a movie. But for those people who don\u2019t know the context, what happened after that? John Crowley: So, you know, Tim, right at that day, after that Friday the 13th after Megan was diagnosed, I took the next couple of weeks and really dug deep into what was this disease, this Pompe disease that we had never heard of? It is one of 50 or so, muscular dystrophies. I started to figure out who are the leading scientists working in it. There were very few. A couple here in the States. Principally one at Duke University and a team over in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. I began to reach out to them. I began to take Megan to see them. That was hard too because we had a newborn at home, we had a 3-year old at home and I had a job a year out of business school that was expecting me to work 100 hours a week on an easy week. But this had to take priority. This was the most urgent, as you can think about, that you could imagine. I\u2019ll give you the somewhat brief version of it. We go through all of this. We find some of the doctors. We help raise money for some not-for-profit foundations to bring some more research money in. We raise about $1 million in not-for-profit money in about a year. I the course of that year though, from Megan and then Patrick\u2019s diagnosis, which came about a month later confirmed that he had the disease, even though there was only a one in four chance that he would, we were just determined. I had mentioned that we went through the shock, the grief, the denial, all of that very quickly. We very quickly settled on determination. We didn\u2019t know that we could ever change the course of their disease, but I didn\u2019t want to have to live the rest of our lives wishing that we had tried. We said we would try. We tried through the not-for-profit world. We raised money. We eventually found a researcher with some very exciting science at the University of Oklahoma, a medical research center out there. He couldn\u2019t get any traction raising money. He wanted to start a small company. I tried to introduce him to entrepreneurs, funders \u2013 nothing. By that point, we had already moved back to New Jersey. I was working for a big pharmaceutical company, Bristol-Myers Squibb, a positive in marketing, good health insurance. I had some great mentors there. I did not go to Bristol-Myers to learn kind of a boot camp of how do you run a biotech or biopharma company. I did it because it was in New Jersey, it was a good job, good health insurance, good people. But at nights and on the weekends, I kept raising money for the not-for-profit, raising awareness of the disease. In the midst of that, struggling to keep Megan and Patrick alive. Megan first and then Patrick \u2013 her ability to eat went away within a few months. She had to be tube fed. Her ability to breathe went away by the fall of \u201998. She had small pneumonia. She almost died in the hospital. Had to be ventilated and six months later we went through all the same things with Patrick. He had to be ventilated. Within a year, we went from kids that were perfectly healthy, normal, to two little kids who were ventilator-dependent and wheelchair-bound. Science was beginning to show some promise. But we realized early on that it was going to be a race against time, as much as it was going to be against nature. After two years of doing that, by 2000 and working at Bristol-Myers, I had a choice. Either we could do this full-time or we could let nature run its course. Again, we were so, determined. I quit my job at Bristol-Myers, joined forces with that scientist at Oklahoma. We started a tiny little biotech company. I still had all the student loans, but we had a house, had a little bit of equity, the real estate market in New Jersey was doing well at the time. So, of course, what do you do? We took a home equity loan. So, the first money into the company, we took $100,000.00 home equity loan. All the equity in our house. We thought that would last a long time. It didn\u2019t. Then met payroll with a Visa and a MasterCard. Very prestigious venture firms have used their MasterCard. Tim Ferriss: Tier 1. John Crowley: Yeah, Tier 1. Oh, yeah, top tier. NEA came in right after them. So, what ended up happening, we started this little company and we started that in March of 2000. Within a year, we had some early success. Yes, I put the early money in. We then raised angel money. We raised $1.2 million from 37 individuals. I mean, literally knocking on doors of people who I thought might be qualified investors. In Oklahoma and New Jersey, it was family, it was friends. We did that \u2013 probably the toughest money I\u2019ve ever raised, but it gave us breathing room, gave us room to do some research. We began discovering a treatment. What we had to do was to make an enzyme therapy to basically replace the enzyme that Megan and Patrick and people living with Pompe couldn\u2019t make. That company ended up become very successful, attracting within a year the attention of a lot of people. I think it was successful, Tim, because we literally did not know what we were doing. I was 32 years old. I had some good degrees and an education, but I had no idea how to be an entrepreneur. I certainly had no idea what you do as a biotech CEO. So, I made it up. Because of that, we broke so, many of the conventional rules, I think that\u2019s why were able to beat time as well as nature. By the fall of \u201901, we said, I need more money and I need more manufacturing capabilities to actually make this drug. It was starting to show some promise in some early science results in the labs. So, we made the decision that we would sell the company. We sold it to Genzyme, at the time the largest rare disease biotech company in the world. It was founded by Henri Termeer, a magnificent entrepreneur with a real passion for people living with these diseases. But still it was a big company and it was our competitor. That is what the case study was about. So, the HBS case study of Novazyme, \u201cA Father\u2019s Love,\u201d was the choice that I had presented to our venture investors one year into that business. Do we sell the company to Genzyme? Or do I do a large partnership with a deal that we had negotiated with Genentech? Which would have brought them into the rare diseases. I decided to sell the company to Genzyme because I knew at Genzyme, as much as I respect Genentech, at Genzyme this program had to succeed. So, what we ended up doing is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Why is that? John Crowley: Because for them, rare diseases were there business. They knew this would become, and it did become, their most development program ever. Hundreds of millions of dollars, a very difficult program, a very difficult drug to make, medicine to make. Lots of challenges. I stayed at Genzyme. I was Senior Vice President of Therapeutics at Genzyme. Tim Ferriss: Can I interject for a second? John Crowley: By all means. Tim Ferriss: At this point, were your children already being treated? John Crowley: No. Tim Ferriss: Got it. John Crowley: By the time we came to Genzyme, Genzyme had other Pompe drugs in development. We brought our technologies in. We had a choice of drugs and technologies. We ran a series of experiments and we backed one. There\u2019s one that came from the Genzyme science labs. Children began to be treated. We saw some remarkable results early on. In Pompe disease, not only are the skeletal muscles weak, the cardiac muscle is very weak. By that point, Megan and Patrick, who were 4 and 2 or so, years old, not only were their muscles weakening, not only did they need ventilators to breathe, their hearts were so, enlarged that was the most life-threatening aspect of the disease. Tim Ferriss: Just a quick question. So, glycogen is also, stored in the liver, if I\u2019m remembering correctly. John Crowley: It is. Glycogen is stored in many places in the body. Tim Ferriss: So, does it also, cause problems in organs like the liver? John Crowley: Yes. What you see in the liver is their livers became enormously enlarged. That wasn\u2019t actually an immediate life-threatening aspect. Tim Ferriss: The cardiac. John Crowley: It was the cardiac and then the pulmonary, the breathing. Then, obviously, quality of life with the loss of skeletal muscle strength. When we were at Genzyme, we were moving at full steam. We had lots of resources, great people. We had manufacturing facilities. All the ingredients for success. Beginning to treat kids. Seeing that their cardiac disease was reversed. In some cases, even seeing strengthening of muscles. But I couldn\u2019t get my own kids treated. The protocols that the teams had developed were for younger children. I\u2019ve got to tell you \u2013 one of my toughest days, Tim, was August of 2002. We were doing a family vacation down at the Jersey shore. Still working away, like many people do on vacation. The day before, we took the kids to the doctor. They did echocardiograms. The doctors told us that at that point, Megan had about a year to live, Patrick maybe six months. We had a drug. It was in kids. It was reversing their heart damage, but my kids weren\u2019t yet on that drug. The next day, I got a call from a colleague at Genzyme, who said that a decision was made. The next study with the next material would be in Pompe infants and he knew my kids wouldn\u2019t qualify. That was a really tough day. Thankfully, a lot of good doctors, good people at Genzyme and eventually a small Catholic hospital in New Jersey agreed, St. Peter\u2019s University Hospital in New Brunswick agreed that they would treat our kids. But that was months and months of back and forth discussion, negotiation. It makes for some very dramatic scenes in the movie. Geeta Anand captures it in her book very well. Then by January of 2003, January 9th, what would\u2019ve been my Dad\u2019s birthday, my kids were treated. They became the 27th and 28th patients in the clinical study. That was a great day. Tim Ferriss: So, many things I\u2019d like to ask. Let\u2019s start with what comes to mind, which is, during that period that you just reflected on, just described, that makes for some very dramatic scenes in the movie and certainly compelling reading, and you can answer this however you\u2019d like. Were there any particular negotiations or conversations that were critically important in that period and how did you handle them? John Crowley: There were many and I handled them poorly. That was the most desperate I have ever been in my life, Tim. Literally our kids\u2019 lives were on the line. At that point, I could care less about our career. We were blessed to have actually made some money so, that we had a financial future that was secure for the kids and that was wonderful. But obviously, the focus was on how do we get the kids treated. I was so, frustrated that at one point, by September or so, I reached out to doctors who I knew who were going to be a clinical site for the study, asked them to treat my kids to set up a protocol for them. I went down, I did it, it was at the University of Florida. It made great sense, scientific sense, but it didn\u2019t follow the protocols within the company. I thought at that point, you know what? Better to ask forgiveness than permission. Let\u2019s just get it set up, take the heat, heck, they could fire me. I don\u2019t care. When people found out, it was a very difficult day and made for a lot of tension. Any trust that was there was then broken. For me, I felt it was worth the risk. I took the risk and I lost. We weren\u2019t allowed to do it. There were a lot of conversations in the company and usually I fought it for a week or so, and then realized at that point, I\u2019ve taken this as far as I can, now it\u2019s out of my hands. And so, I stepped back. They went to a hospital. That hospital then actually \u2013 I said okay, I\u2019m not going to run this. We\u2019ll let others run it. Then the FDA was comfortable, Genzyme the company was comfortable, this large, academic teaching institution, their institutional review board that approves clinical studies would not approve it because the study included children of an executive of the company whose drug was being studied. So, now I\u2019m like, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. That then became not only a hard day for me and Aileen and the family, that was a hard day for my colleagues at Genzyme because they were fighting very hard to get our kids treated at that point. By that point, I had really just \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say given up \u2013 but prayed a lot, fought a lot, spent a lot of time with the kids. Then right around Thanksgiving, we learned that they were able to meet with an expert who knew the disease who was at St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and they were going to present it to their institutional review board for approval. I learned about it, was thankful, hopeful, prayerful, but just to make sure, I resigned. I quit. I did that the day before the hospital review board met. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue. It wasn\u2019t an issue. But I didn\u2019t want anybody to make an issue out of it. So, I quit and I waited to hear. We got a card, a letter \u2013 first a phone call then a letter came Christmas Eve. It was a Christmas card, a beautiful picture of the blessed mother on the cover, with a copy of the hospital letter approving the study for Pompe disease at their center that would include our kids. That was the best Christmas present we\u2019ve ever gotten. Tim Ferriss: How did you respond to that? How does one \u2013 I can\u2019t even fathom. John Crowley: I got the mail that day. It was Christmas Eve. I looked at it and I read it, I cried. I wanted to run in and share it with Aileen. I wanted to share it with Megan, with Patrick. I said, I\u2019m going to wait a little bit. We had family, we had Aileen\u2019s family, her Mom and Dad, my Mom coming over for Christmas Eve dinner. So, they came over and we had a glass of wine and were celebrating and nice Christmas and Poppy, the kids\u2019 grandfather, read \u2018Twas the Night Before Christmas. I was just dying to share this. I was in a really good mood. Aileen didn\u2019t know why I was in such a good mood. She figured it was the Cabernet maybe. Then we sat down at dinner. We said grace and I said, \u201cI have something else to share.\u201d I read the card and the letter. That was a good Christmas Eve. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a good night. John Crowley: That was a good night. Tim Ferriss: That is a good night. I\u2019m going to backtrack for a second. You mentioned something I\u2019d love to get just a few examples of. You said, \u201cWe broke a lot of conventional rules,\u201d because in a sense you didn\u2019t know any better. John Crowley: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: What were some of the conventions that you broke or the things you did differently? John Crowley: When you\u2019re developing a drug, one of the things you need to do is, you kind of go through these rigorous series of experiments to show in animal models of the disease that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s actually working. Is it getting to the muscles in this disease? Is it breaking down the glycogen so, the animals get stronger? Typically, you\u2019ll do that at outsourced companies. These are the experts. It takes quite a bit of time. Done, again, in a very rigorous fashion. Once we had made a little bit of that enzyme in the lab, I was just dying to see, is this going to work? The NIH had genetically engineered mice to not express the protein to give them the Pompe disease, which my daughter Megan still thinks is the meanest thing imaginable. It\u2019s done very ethically. We had these animals. I had the enzyme. I was with one of my colleagues, who is a senior vice president in my then 11-person company, because you\u2019re either a VP or you weren\u2019t in the company. He said, \u201cI used to be a hospital tech. I could do this.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, yeah, let\u2019s try it.\u201d So, when you do this, you\u2019ve actually got to hit a really narrow vein in the tail of these animals to give it the injection. That\u2019s a really tough stick. So, my buddy, who hasn\u2019t drawn blood in about ten years, he\u2019s there. We do put gloves on in the lab. He puts a little bit of the enzyme into the mouse. I look at him and he looks at me and he goes, \u201cI think I got it in.\u201d Okay. So, we do that once a week for four weeks and then our scientists sacrifice, grind up the tissues. That\u2019s not how you do animal experiments. I can assure you that study failed. I can give you a whole bunch of reasons why it failed. So, those are the hard lessons of things you shouldn\u2019t do. There were things though that we did that were successful. One of the things we did, I knew we had to make this drug in a way that we can deliver it to humans. So, what\u2019s known as a GMP facility \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Good manufacturing practice. John Crowley: Good manufacturing practice, exactly. You\u2019re familiar. We actually invested and made a plant. I couldn\u2019t build a green field plant. It costs too much, takes forever. I met some entrepreneurs who had just begun to develop a system of basically building a building within a building; a clean room. We could do it for a couple of million dollars and we had raised about $27 million at that point. We did that. We did it at risk. We didn\u2019t have the definitive proof of concept in animals. But we did it very smart, very fast, and very effectively. Although we never made the enzyme in that plant because by that point I realized I probably need a bigger plant, given the scale of what we needed to manufacture. Had we done it, it could\u2019ve gotten us in the clinic. Where that was successful was it gave me a fallback, if any of these partnerships or the acquisition didn\u2019t work, and when I negotiated the deal, instead of the big company on the other side saying, \u201cYou need us because you can\u2019t make it,\u201d I could take it and say, \u201cYes, I can make this. Look at this.\u201d That was pretty unusual. People usually don\u2019t make those levels of investments and do it in a very unconventional way. That was a good decision. Lots of bad decisions, but that was a good one. Tim Ferriss: Now your children are healthy? John Crowley: So, Megan and Patrick began receiving that enzyme therapy. It\u2019s an every other week, IV-administered therapy designed to replace the enzyme that they\u2019re missing. They started that in January of \u201903 and then we waited. We got the first results back in early April. The doctor came in with a smile and Megan was sitting up in bed. Before she even got to the echocardiogram reports, she turned on the x-ray, the light box, had two x-rays. One of Megan of her upper body, and you saw this \u2013 you didn\u2019t need to be a cardiologist \u2013 you s aw this enormously enlarged heart. That was before her treatment 12 weeks ago. Then she put up the one that was taken earlier that day. It was night and day. Her heart had shrunken back to normal. I took it to Megan\u2019s bedside, showed her, explained, and she was all of 5 or 6 years old at the time. I explained to her. She was a kindergartener. I said, \u201cMegan, this means you\u2019re going to live to be an old lady.\u201d She looked at me and put her arm around me and gave me a big hug and a kiss and just said, \u201cThank you.\u201d Biotech is a really tough business, Tim. Almost everything we try, it doesn\u2019t work. But when it does work, it really is the best job you can have. So, the medicine fixed the kids\u2019 hearts. For a while it made them stronger, particularly Megan. But after about a year or so, the strength improvements plateaued. Then slowly began to regress. A year into treatment, they were much better. Their lives were saved. We realized it was an effective first-generation treatment, but it wasn\u2019t a cure. What I realized then at that point, was I think we just bought a lot of time and some quality of life for the kids. They\u2019re still on ventilators, still in wheelchairs, but it helped them enormously. I realized then, I think we have to go do this again. We need to find next-generation therapies, newer, potentially better medicines. That\u2019s what led me to found this company, Amicus, in 2005. Do it again. Tim Ferriss: How are your kids today? John Crowley: The kids today \u2013 Megan just turned 20. Patrick is 19 in March. They\u2019re 15 months apart. Patrick is a senior in high school and Megan is a sophomore at Notre Dame. Tim Ferriss: Have many people like her gone through Notre Dame before? John Crowley: With Notre Dame\u2019s mission, it\u2019s certainly welcoming of people who are intellectually capable of the rigorous academics, but who have disabilities. At Notre Dame, we\u2019ve had kids go through, we\u2019ve had blind students, deaf students. There was a young man, Matt Swinton, who graduated with spinal muscular atrophy a number of years ago, Duchenne boys. People with severe difficulties. Megan is the most physically challenged student ever to go through Notre Dame. She is the only student to have to live in a wheelchair, on a ventilator, with 24/7 nursing. So, after she was admitted, she was hesitant to go so, far away to school. I said, \u201cMegan, if that\u2019s where you think you want to go, we will make this happen.\u201d Then I called folks I know at Notre Dame who I know and I said, \u201cOkay, Megan\u2019s coming. What are we going to do?\u201d They said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll do whatever we need to do.\u201d I\u2019ve got to tell you, Tim, they stepped up. The ladies\u2019 dorm that she lives in, Ryan Hall, was designed to be handicapped accessible. It had handicapped-accessible suites. They combined suites for Megan. They made every door of every building that she needs access to across campus accessible on her key fob. They\u2019ve adjusted her class schedule. They\u2019ve provided aides and tutors. It was still a big show getting her out to South Bend. Where I was most proud, I told Megan, \u201cIf you get in, we\u2019ll get you there and we\u2019ll make sure with the University\u2019s help that we get you through.\u201d When we showed up, lots of getting used to. The nurses who came out to help, they were all going to college again. They were excited, but apprehensive. We had planned for almost everything we could. I had the nurse schedule, the hospital supply, they had the hospital bed moved in. Megan wants to live a full college life. She wants to be in the dorms, so, she was in the dorms. One thing we hadn\u2019t thought about is Megan\u2019s a 20-year-old young lady now. Weighs about 100 pounds. While you only need one nurse there to care for her, it takes two people to transfer her in and out of her wheelchair. I hadn\u2019t thought about who that second person\u2019s going to be. When I was in her dorm that second weekend, I was looking. I didn\u2019t even think about it. I saw the nursing schedule on the board and then I saw a schedule next to it. It was students who had signed up in her dorm to be there seven times a day at specific times to get Megan in and out of her wheelchair. Tim Ferriss: Wow, that gives me some hope for humanity. John Crowley: There are some great kids, indeed. Tim Ferriss: How have you raised your kids? Specifically, you can make it more generic if you\u2019d like, but what do you think the principles of good parenting are? John Crowley: I would say that we raised our kids, and my daughter Megan would say that she raised us. Somewhere in between lies the truth. Some of the basic rules in life you want to teach them. You try to teach them about hard work, about independence. One thing that\u2019s remarkable though, I\u2019ve learned with kids with special needs, and I\u2019ve seen it not just with our kids, but lots of kids we\u2019ve met over the years, and different from adults I\u2019ve known who suffer with some awful diseases. These kids who live with these rare diseases, kids who live with cancers, they never feel sorry for themselves. That\u2019s something Aileen and I as parents could never teach them. It just has to be part of who the are. I\u2019ve seen that measure of resilience in these kids. I\u2019ve seen it in our kids in spades. I\u2019ve certainly seen it in many other children with a lot of rare and devastating diseases. Because of that, I kid around that Megan says she raised us, but I have to tell you, for the things that we\u2019ve tried to teach our kids about working hard and independence and one of the lessons I try to teach our kids is that it\u2019s bigger than you. Whatever \u201cit\u201d may be. Whatever you\u2019re working on, it\u2019s bigger than you. Tim Ferriss: Could you give me an example where that might apply? Or just describe what you mean by that? John Crowley: Yeah, so, we often get enveloped in our own little universes. Even when we think we\u2019re helping others, sometimes we think a little bit too much about ourselves in the process. I try to teach our kids that there\u2019s a bigger purpose to life. I\u2019ll give you an example. We took our son, John \u2013 now John does not have Pompe disease. But John has Asperger\u2019s. John has his own challenges. We tried to raise him with a spirit of that sense of faith and community and a bit of giving back to others. Most parents do that. I took him down when he was little, every year to Washington, D.C. We do a father-son trip. I\u2019d take him to the memorials and the monuments and every year I\u2019d always take him to Arlington National Cemetery. We were there one year and they were doing a special service and it was to recognize wounded warriors. It was right at the start of the Iraq War. It was 2003. There was a young man there who\u2019d lost both his legs, a 19-year-old corporal in the Marine Corps. They were giving a speech and people going on. I looked at John and his eyes were wandering. He\u2019s got ADHD and I was wondering, is he getting it? I looked at him and I said, \u201cJohn, do you know what they\u2019re talking about?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d \u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d He said, \u201cThat young man fought for our country. He lost his legs and all these people in this cemetery lost their lives. He is a hero and they are heroes.\u201d I just thought okay, he got it. In his own way, with his own special needs, he was able to articulate that it\u2019s bigger than him. Tim Ferriss: What would your advice be to parents, and there are almost certainly parents listening who either have kids with special needs or who will have kids with special needs, what would you say to them? What would your advice or otherwise be that you\u2019d want to convey to them? John Crowley: We tried really early to be a so-called normal family. I could tell you there\u2019s a lot of times early in life where I wanted, we wanted to have \u201cnormal kids.\u201d Sometimes I was mad and angry and frustrated. Sometimes I behaved very irresponsibly because I wanted a normal family. I wanted to do normal things. I wanted to just be able to take the kids and go to Burger King at night. Go to the movies. Things that all of our friends and many of our friends were doing. Then I realized that \u2013 and I tried teaching this to the kids \u2013 we\u2019re all different. We\u2019re all special. Megan and Patrick, people may look at the two of them and I tell them, \u201cYes, people can look at you and realize you\u2019re different, but it\u2019s these differences in life that make us so, special.\u201d We talk about, obviously racial diversity and sexual orientation, whatever it may be. That\u2019s part of the richness, the fabric of life. But it took me a while, even as a parent of actually three special needs kids, to realize that\u2019s a gift in itself and it adds to the diversity in life. We talked about 2002, how that was a really tough year. Right after that beach trip, after the kids were diagnosed, I thought, \u201cMy, God. Megan\u2019s only going to live a few months, what do we do?\u201d Aileen said, \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to send her to kindergarten because that\u2019s what kids do when they\u2019re 5 years old.\u201d I pushed back and then finally said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s see.\u201d So, we called the local school. We had just to Princeton. We said \u201cHi, we\u2019re the Crowleys. We\u2019re here. We\u2019ve got to register our daughter, Megan, for kindergarten. By the way, she\u2019s got this little issue you should probably know about.\u201d They were like, okay. So, they came and they visited. The principal, the child study team. They met Megan and they came back, the principal called me a day later and said \u201cJohn, great young lady. I just don\u2019t think our public school is equipped for Megan. We\u2019ve never had a kid on a ventilator with a nurse and in a wheelchair.\u201d Especially a kid, and I didn\u2019t even tell him, who may only live 6 or 12 months. Bob Ginsburg, wonderful principal, I said, \u201cBob, I really think that she thrives around being with kids, with people. I don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s going to live. I hope a long time but I don\u2019t know. Would you please give it a shot?\u201d He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Thought about it, called me back and said, \u201cOkay, Megan can come to kindergarten. But John, would you do me a favor? Would you come in and talk to all the parents of the incoming kindergartners to dispel any myths, rumors, whatever? I did that. I came in, told them what Pompe disease is, told them your kids can\u2019t catch it. Everybody kind of looked at me and shrugged and kind of half-smiled. I figured okay, I bored them, but I did my job. Megan started kindergarten. Kindergarten year was great for Megan. She loved it. The gym teacher made up special routines for her in the wheelchair. She was going to birthday parties. In the middle of that kindergarten year, she started getting that medicine, such that by the second half of kindergarten, she was so, much stronger. Then you go to kindergarten graduation. We get there and these kids, they get the little hats and diplomas and it\u2019s really cute. It\u2019s fun for any parent and special for any little kid. Then Megan was called to get hers. She got a lot of extra applause. I was really proud. Then the principal came over to me and said, \u201cJohn, can I talk to you?\u201d I said, \u201cSure.\u201d He goes, \u201cMegan had a great year. You were right.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, thank you so, much. What you did was remarkable,\u201d and it really was. He said, \u201cBut I want to share something with you.\u201d He said, \u201cRight after you gave that talk eight months ago, I got a lot of phone calls and letters and emails from those parents. The message was all the same. It was basically, \u2018Look, beautiful young lady. We feel so, sorry for her. But kindergarten is such an important year and my son or my daughter just won\u2019t be able to learn in that environment. Could you please not put my child in that girl\u2019s class?\u2019\u201d I\u2019m looking at him and I\u2019m thinking, first of all, your feelings are hurt. Then you feel sorry for your kid that somebody would think that of them. Then he looks at me and he says, \u201cJohn, I tell you this for a reason.\u201d He said, \u201cIn the last few weeks, I\u2019ve gotten an awful lot of letters and calls and emails.\u201d Now I\u2019m thinking, how is he going to tell me that she can\u2019t go to first grade here? He said, \u201cThe message is all consistent, it\u2019s all the same. It\u2019s \u2018Dr. Ginsburg, we know it\u2019s difficult and this is hard to ask, but our son or our daughter learned so, much and had such a great time with Megan in kindergarten, if there\u2019s any way that they can be in her first-grade class, we\u2019d owe you the world.\u2019\u201d Then you get emotional thinking about it. Then I thought, you know, Megan was just trying to be a normal kindergartener. She didn\u2019t have to teach those kids. What I\u2019ve found is first day, kids ask, came up and kind of looked at her funny and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d She said, \u201cOh, I have a disease. My legs and arms don\u2019t work, but my mind does.\u201d They\u2019d look. They\u2019d shrug their shoulders and say \u201cOkay. You want to go play a game?\u201d Kids got over it in like 30 seconds. The parents were the ones who had the problem. Think about it. What ended up happening was Megan, without ever knowing it, by her example and by just being a kid, taught those big people a really important lesson. I think it was a real lesson about the importance of diversity and what people with special needs and physical disabilities, whatever the challenge in life physically or medically may be, can bring such a richness to the lives of others. For me as a parent, that was a real lesson that little people can teach us big people an awful lot if we just listen. Maybe it is true that everything you needed to learn in life you needed to learn in kindergarten. Tim Ferriss: I was at the bad table a lot in kindergarten. Well, actually, no. I got in a fight and I had to write a letter which was apologizing for punching some other kid in the privates. My Mom kept this letter. I was put at the bad table and then I didn\u2019t do anything bad, but the teacher forgot it was the bad table. So, I just sat there all year. So, you can say, psychoanalyze that. Who knows where that has led? John Crowley: Yeah, this explains a lot, Tim, you realize. It clears up a lot for a lot of listeners. Tim Ferriss: It was Dennis and myself were the two kids isolated at the bad table. The teacher forgot it was the bad table. I wanted to ask you about the challenge, perhaps, of trying to help kids with rare diseases. I ask because here we are sitting in Silicon Valley in San Francisco right now and the first thing many entrepreneurs do is, or one of the first things, is they think about their total addressable market for a given product or service. How does one create a company that is economically viable when trying to develop drugs or treatments for rare diseases? Is it a matter of having a larger portfolio of different diseases? How does that work? John Crowley: Sure. So, there are 7,000 known rare diseases that together just in the United States, affect about 30 million people. Individually, by definition, rare. Taken together, they\u2019re actually more prevalent than all HIV and all cancers combined. The challenge, of course, is they\u2019re all unique and they all need their own unique medicines. What we typically do is we\u2019ll begin with is it a rare disease? If it is, how rare is it? When we first got into this, it used to be if a disease was below 5,000 or 10,000 prevalence, it was just too small. There was no economic model to sustain it. It\u2019s now come down though, I think with the advancements in technology, with regulatory science just beginning to understand faster paths to approve these medicines. That now is coming down to probably around 500 or 1,000. You have a disease with, call it 500 or 1,000 or more patients. You can build an economic model to support that. For us, when we look at will we work in a rare disease? It\u2019s is it devastating? Do we have a technology that can apply? Can that technology make a meaningful difference for these patients? The last thing we look at is, how many patients have the disease? With that model, you can get to many of these diseases. Not all. We can\u2019t figure out yet what do you do with these rare diseases that affect 5, 10, 100 patients. There, NIH, other areas could fill in the gap perhaps. But we can make a big dent in it. Tim Ferriss: What keeps you going at this point? What are your main drivers? John Crowley: It\u2019s not a lot different than it was 10 or 20 years ago. In business, now that we\u2019ve got Amicus, and the whole notion there is we were going to make medicines for rare diseases, devastating disorders. Tim Ferriss: How did you choose the name? John Crowley: Amicus in Latin, of course, means \u201cfriend.\u201d We wanted the company to be the most patient-centered biotech company in the universe. We thought well, if you\u2019re going to be \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of great names in biotech companies. They\u2019re all usually named after Greek gods of healing or complex science names. We thought friend biotechnologies just sounded a little too cute, but if you Latin-ed it up a little bit, all of a sudden, Amicus, it\u2019s got some weight, some gravitas. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s very high-brow. John Crowley: Yeah, it\u2019s very sophisticated. But if you look at it, it just means friend. Tim Ferriss: Got it. I took you off your train of thought though. John Crowley: Not at all. Tim Ferriss: You were just describing \u2013 let me try to rewind my brain here. John Crowley: You asked what keeps me going. Tim Ferriss: Right, and you said it hasn\u2019t changed much. John Crowley: It hasn\u2019t changed much. For me, it was a focus on how can you, as an entrepreneur \u2013 because I\u2019m not a scientist. I\u2019ve learned a lot of science over the years. Years ago, I hired tutors at night to teach me science. So, being immersed in the field, you have to learn it. For me, it\u2019s how can you use the vehicle of entrepreneurship to drive medicine? I\u2019ve always believed if you make great medicines, push science as far and as fast as you can, you\u2019ll figure the business model out. You\u2019ll make great value. You look at the great biotech companies today, the Genentech\u2019s out here, the Amgen\u2019s, Genzyme\u2019s, they all started the same way. They started with a couple of scientists, a couple of venture capitalists and some entrepreneurs. Every great biotech company. You can\u2019t point to one that was a spin-out or a bunch of mergers. They started that way. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do at Amicus now. One difference is early in my career, with the first company at Novazyme, I thought it was a sprint. In some respects, it was. Now that the kids have a medicine, even though it\u2019s not a cure, and not, I don\u2019t think, the best, most effective treatment, it\u2019s now enabled me to change my view, Tim, that it\u2019s a marathon. With that, we guess we can move incredibly fast, but we can look for the best science and push it for Pompe disease or for any disease that we\u2019re looking at. If we do that, we can do some, and have done, some really great things. Tim Ferriss: How and when did the military re-enter the picture? John Crowley: September 11th. After 9/11, I though maybe I have some skills and certainly have a lot of passion and two hands that I can contribute. I went through the whole process and was commissioned an officer in the Navy Reserve a couple years after September 11th. I actually was sworn into the Navy by my Naval Academy roommate, Ed Devinney, who was a Navy Commander at the time. It just so, happened \u2013 I didn\u2019t realize it, but they told me the office after I went through the two-year application process and because I was becoming an intelligence officer a year-long background check. So, I miraculously passed the background check and they gave me all the top secret and other clearances. Then I got this letter saying report on such-and-such date for your swearing in. I called the officer in charge. I said, \u201cHey, would it be okay if Commander Devinney,\u201d now he\u2019s pretty high-ranking in the Navy at this point, \u201cwas there to swear me in?\u201d This young officer said, \u201cWell, yeah, of course.\u201d He gave me the address. Some street, lower Manhattan. I didn\u2019t realize it was a Navy reserve recruiting office overlooking the World Trade Center site. Tim Ferriss: Wow. John Crowley: Yeah, that was pretty emotional. Tim Ferriss: Now, I\u2019ll try to tread carefully here. I don\u2019t want to get into territory that you can\u2019t talk about. You\u2019ve had experiences with elite units? Would that be a fair phrase to put it? A fair way to put it? I\u2019m wondering what you think the characteristics are. Because if we look back to baseball and so, on, you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, I was 5\u20196\u201d, 150 pounds, I wasn\u2019t the super athlete.\u201d What are the characteristics you think that have made you successful in that world as well and capable? John Crowley: I was fortunate in the military in the 11 years I spent in the Navy Reserve, Tim, as an intelligence officer. I was assigned for most of that time to the Joint Special Operations Commander, JSOC. I got to work with some of the most elite units in our military. You talk about serving in the company of heroes. These men and women are just remarkable. I was fortunate enough to have co-workers at Amicus as we started that, and then even as a public company, there was a time I was told I was the only public company CEO was an active-duty Reservist in the country. I served three periods of active duty, in addition to the Reserve duty, including a deployment to Afghanistan. There I served as a Deputy Chief of Intelligence for a counter-terror task force. I got to put a very small dent in the universe in terms of things that were important to me to contribute to. One thing that carries over from life, from business, to the military, for me certainly in biotech, you\u2019ve got to be persistent. It\u2019s that resiliency that in biotech, again, almost everything we try doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019ve got to have the stomach for that. You\u2019ve got to have that sense of this has to work. Biotech, for me, it certainly had to work because our kids\u2019 lives depended on it. That\u2019s something that anybody who\u2019s been in the military knows. Especially when you\u2019re deployed. It has to work. You cannot fail. Not just because the mission is so, important but because you\u2019ve pledged your lives to the people around you. That is a very sacred commitment and oath and something I was in awe of every day. I believe that serving in the military was the greatest honor of my life. It\u2019s something I\u2019m proud of, but that taught me as much about life and certainly sacrifice and having done it during the course of wartime, and the people who I served with, what they sacrificed, many of whom lost their lives, is something I will certainly never forget and it was an honor for me. Tim Ferriss: In the \u2013 it could be in the civilian sphere, in business or elsewhere \u2013 but when you are feeling uncertain of what to do next or perhaps are overwhelmed in some way, a lot of inputs or otherwise, what\u2019s your process for figuring out what to do? John Crowley: I try to think about what\u2019s the situation and what are my options? So, take it to business. When we started Novazyme, when I started Amicus, I didn\u2019t build the business plan from the bottom up. What I\u2019ve always started with is what\u2019s the vision? What do we want to look like in 5 years? In 10 years? Then work backwards for there. If you set the vision, then think about, okay, big vision, what are the barriers to get there? For me early on in Novazyme, for instance, there were a lot. It was money. It was recruiting talent. It was facilities. All of that. Just slowly think about and process, how do I break down these barriers? Now you can take that from a big venture, like building a company from scratch, all the way into a situation in a combat zone and what you\u2019re trained for. Okay, this is the objective. Things will invariably go wrong in the fog of war. If and when they go wrong, what are my options and what\u2019s the optimal path through that? Tim Ferriss: What books have you, besides your own, gifted to other people? Book or books. John Crowley: I\u2019m a big fan of history, Tim. American history, revolutionary history. Living now for almost 20 years in Princeton, surrounded by revolutionary history. Even as a kid I was. There\u2019s a great book by an author named Benson Bobrick called Angel in the Whirlwind. It\u2019s a history of the American Revolution. Obviously, countless histories of the American Revolution have been written. This one\u2019s pretty special in that he\u2019s a great storyteller. There is a great hero in the book. Do you want to guess who the hero of the American Revolution is? It\u2019s not a trick question. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t even want to \u2013 I\u2019m afraid to embarrass myself. John Crowley: George Washington. Tim Ferriss: There we go, okay. John Crowley: So, easy answer, George Washington. Tim Ferriss: I was going to go for the layup, but I was like, I might flub it. John Crowley: He picks a villain and it\u2019s Benedict Arnold. Now, he tells the whole story in very rich detail about the American Revolution, very character-centric. You\u2019ve got to realize what they did, and it\u2019s told in that book, is just so, extraordinary. It\u2019s never happened before or since in the history of the world of people coming together for that cause. Within the American Revolution, realizing they fought for this great ideal, lots of sacrifice. They mutually pledged their lives, their fortune, their sacred honor. Every single person who signed the Declaration of Independence died peacefully in their own bed. Where else has that happened in the history of the world? Great lessons in life. I think it\u2019s a great book. It\u2019s a great way to learn history. Tim Ferriss: Who are some underrated or lesser-known leaders you think are worth \u2013 who inspire you or are worth studying? John Crowley: We talked about the importance of persistence and resilience. You can go back \u2013 the founding of the biotech industry only goes back 41 years, 1976. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s wild. John Crowley: Isn\u2019t that crazy? And it was founded here in San Francisco, in the Bay area. It was a young venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins, Bob Swanson, he was looking at ideas and came across some papers written by a University of California at San Francisco, UCSF professor, named Herb Boyer. The papers talked about protein engineering and DNA sequencing and expression of proteins in animal-based cells and maybe someday making medicines out of this. Swanson took a drive up, knocked on his door, started asking questions, starting putting stuff on a board. He literally went across the street to a bar and started putting it together on a cocktail napkin. Think about it \u2013 so, you talk about in building business the importance of vision and risk taking, all of that. But think of what those guys did. Not only did they have to take a chance on a technology with all of those challenges, they had to start a company, they had to start an industry that didn\u2019t even yet exist, and sell it to the partners at Kleiner Perkins. Boyer had to leave the academic world. But they did that. Think what the world look like \u2013 what would our industry at least look like, biotech, without Genentech? It would be very different. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve never visited Genentech, but is it true \u2013 John Crowley: You\u2019ve got to go, man. Tim Ferriss: I heard a story \u2013 and maybe you can confirm or reject this \u2013 that when they were expanding or building the headquarters and expanding the facilities, there was a donut shop and the donut shop would not sell its real estate, so, they built their campus or their buildings around the doughnut shop. Maybe urban legend, but I hear that \u2013 John Crowley: I\u2019ve been to Genentech. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve never seen the doughnut shop? John Crowley: Never been to the doughnut store. Tim Ferriss: I guess that would be a good one to tell Tim Ferriss so, he\u2019d embarrass himself on a podcast because if I haven\u2019t been there, clearly, I can\u2019t know that it is an outright lie. John Crowley: But you look at people outside of our industry and probably most in biotech have never heard of Bob Swanson and Herb Boyer. Swanson ended up dying in the \u201890s of a brain tumor. The vision that they had, the risk taking, those are real heroes. Another one is, you go back to probably the earliest biotech entrepreneur, who never even knew he was an entrepreneur, is Jonas Salk. Polio was the scourge of the society from a healthcare standpoint in \u201840s, \u201850s, obviously. FDR affected by it. A young researcher at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center named Jonas Salk, had an idea that he could develop a vaccine for it. He got some funding from the Infantile Paralysis Foundation, what we now call the March of Dimes, developing a vaccine. He worked on it tirelessly. His whole lab well funded. He put it together, tested it on himself, on his co-workers, his family. He did a large series of experiments and it didn\u2019t work. There was a great interview years later that I read. It was a magazine ironically called Wisdom. They talked to Dr. Salk about that. Because, of course, he then went on to invent the vaccine that saved countless lives and effectively eradicated polio from the world. They asked him though, after years of effort and a big experiment that failed, what did you do? He said, \u201cI thought about it. I thought about how I\u2019m going to tell my family, my co-workers, the people who put the money into this, that it didn\u2019t work. So, I walked, I went to a park,\u201d he said, \u201cand I thought about what I what\u2019s going to say.\u201d I read it in this article, Tim. He said, \u201cAnd I looked out in the park and I saw dozens of children at play and I realized without a vaccine, many of them would develop polio, would suffer, and may die.\u201d He said, \u201cAt that moment, I realized the enormity of my work and I went back to it with a renewed vigor.\u201d I\u2019ve always tried to think about that. What if Salk didn\u2019t go back to try it again? I\u2019ve had plenty of failures in biotech. Plenty of drugs that haven\u2019t worked. Studies that were delayed. Every setback you could imagine. I try to think about that. Tim Ferriss: If you were to develop a training curriculum for civilians. It could certainly have elements borrowed from any sphere. But if you wanted to develop a course or training of some type to make people more resilient, how would you go about doing that? I\u2019ve thought a lot about this because I\u2019ve wanted to, over time, make myself more resilient and thought of all sorts of different voluntary suffering, whether it\u2019s excruciating physical training, cold exposure, fasting, exercises of those types. What might you add to that or how would you go about it? Because I think that people listening would \u2013 everyone who\u2019s listening to this episode probably wants to become more resilient and to be the one who perseveres. How can you develop that? John Crowley: The old adage is \u201ctrial adversity builds character.\u201d I think that is true for most people. The trouble is, it\u2019s very hard to create artificial adversity. Now, we can do it and certainly in your books and your lectures you talk about different ways that you\u2019ve tried to do it that you\u2019ve taught others to do. You could do it through rigorous physical training, you could do it through a discipline. You can do it through focusing more on certain activities in life that require sacrifice. That\u2019s all true and I think that\u2019s all an element of it. What I\u2019ve come to realize is there is no way to substitute pure experience. We will all go through adversity in life. So, you don\u2019t have to worry about ohmygod, I\u2019m never going to get the experience of adversity. Believe me, you will. Sometimes more than you ever thought you would. The thing that makes it better is to realize, take that step back and think about what matters in life. To me, it comes down to time. In Geeta\u2019s book, The Cure, about our family, in the epilogue to that book after having spent two years writing it and spending a lot of time with our family and researchers, a lot of time with our kids, she wrote something, Tim. She wrote that at the end of the day, we\u2019re all just searching for time. Time with the people we love. We treasure it, we hold onto it and we hope and pray for another, even as we continue into the unknown and the unknowable that we all call life. That\u2019s it. To me, it\u2019s all about time. What did we do with our medicine? Why did we do it? We did it to buy time. Time in life. So, far, Megan and Patrick now have lived 13 years longer than they otherwise would have. Now it\u2019s given them time, given us time together. It\u2019s given them better quality of life and quality of life, of course, is so, important. But again, it\u2019s given me as an entrepreneur and our scientists time to come up with maybe the next best medicine and new technologies so, that cycle of innovation, that virtuous circle of healing that can happen with great medicines gives us time. Somebody, I want to say it was Anna Quindlen, once wrote in one of her books that \u201cLife is a fatal illness.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Life is a fatal illness? John Crowley: Life is a fatal illness. I think about that. What if you went to the doctor tomorrow, God forbid, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got your test results back and you\u2019re only going to live six more months.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Which could happen, right? John Crowley: It could happen. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s happened to friends of mine. John Crowley: It happens every day to people. So, that could happen. So, what do you do? You forget about work, you focus on family, love. All of a sudden, life becomes very sharply in focus. What if you went to that doctor and he said, \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got some illness. You\u2019ve only got five years to live.\u201d Still very serious. Life comes pretty sharply in focus. You may not walk away from your job that day, but take some time, maybe start to think about therapies. What if you went to the doc and you\u2019re 30 years old and had your physical and the doc goes through everything, blood work, everything looks great. You\u2019re following the Tim Ferriss regimen, you\u2019re in great physical shape, but I have to share this with you, you\u2019re going to die. Now somebody, they turn white, ohmygod. Yes, I\u2019m virtually certain. I can\u2019t predict exactly when, but on average, if you want time, you want to know, I think you\u2019ve got 49 years old. That\u2019s it. You\u2019re going to live to be 80. Right? 79.9 I think now is the average life expectancy. We\u2019re all going to pass away from this earth. So, what do you leave and what did you do in the meantime? But also, what are you fighting for? You\u2019re fighting for time. What do you do with that time? Tim Ferriss: You are probably the perfect person to ask the following. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve grappled with and continue to grapple with. That is the notion that you should live every day like it\u2019s your last. But in practice, that\u2019s very difficult to do, it would seem. Because if it\u2019s your last day or your last month, which it could be, you never know. You take a wrong turn or not the wrong turn, you just take a left turn instead of a right turn, you get hit by a bus. Anything could happen. If you do have years ahead of you, then there will be periods of postponing certain gratifications, certain things you enjoy. There will be long-term planning. How do you balance or think about those two for yourself? Because I\u2019ll read, for instance, I\u2019ll read a bunch of Stoicism, then I\u2019ll go in one direction. Then I\u2019ll read a bunch of \u2013 who knows \u2013 whether it\u2019s Rumi or Zen Buddhist thinking. Or maybe it\u2019s a non-philosopher, but nonetheless someone who has a strong position and perspective on how to treat time. I haven\u2019t resolved it for myself. How do you think about it, if you do think about it? John Crowley: It is the one thing that I struggle with most. It is finding that balance in life. Many times, in life, I\u2019ve gotten it wrong. I probably still don\u2019t do it very well. Look, you\u2019ve got to work hard. Hard work is the price of success. But you\u2019ve got to find those times to step back. Even if it can\u2019t be the quantity of time that you want with friends, with family, treasure the moments that you have. For me, the toughest decision years ago, in starting that first biotech at Novazyme was realizing that I was going to be, every Monday morning, flying to Oklahoma City and flying around the world, and that my kids may live a very short time and I was going to miss most all of it. But Aileen and I \u2013 she said, \u201cLook, you go out and search for the cure. I\u2019ll take care of the kids.\u201d We had a great division of labor. But I still felt badly for the kids; I felt badly for myself that I was going to miss that time. That was a conscious decision we made and it was a bet that paid off for us. But I still struggle with that, Tim, finding the right balance. I\u2019ll share a brief story with you. When we went public, Amicus went public in May of 2007. We\u2019d only been around for a couple of years. It was an IPO with a lot of fanfare that people were throwing money at us. You go out \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The roadshow? John Crowley: \u2013 investment banks, you do this roadshow. It sounds pretty sexy. It\u2019s grueling. It\u2019s like Groundhog Day. 80 of the same meetings around the world. The cool thing is the banks will get you a Gulfstream V or whatever to fly around in. I\u2019d never been in a private plane. I thought that was pretty cool. So, you go through. We had a great IPO. Eight times over subscribed. Wall Street, now on this second company, Amicus, gave us a $300 million pre-money valuation. We raised $75 million. We go to New York, we closed the deal. Lots of backslapping at the Board level. The next morning, we\u2019re there. We closed the Stock Exchange. I\u2019m on CNBC. We\u2019re being interviewed. For an entrepreneur, that\u2019s about the height of success. You feel pretty darn good about yourself. Six years, seven years before that, I was knocking on doors trying to raise money, just a little bit to pay the rent for our company. Now people were begging me to take tens of millions of dollars. So, you feel pretty good. I had the company in, we did a big celebration, a party. But I was pretty tired of this. Two weeks on the road, pretty grueling. So, I went home that night. I went in like most moms and dads who travel. You go in, check on the kids. The boys sleep pretty soundly, so, John and Patrick were sleeping. I gave them a kiss and they didn\u2019t stir. I went into my daughter, Megan\u2019s, room. She was 10 years old at the time. Still hooked up to a ventilator, laying in bed, sleeping quietly. She\u2019s a pretty light sleeper. So, I gave her a kiss and her eyes opened up. She said, \u201cDaddy!\u201d I said, \u201cMegan!\u201d She threw her arms open, \u201cGive me a hug.\u201d I gave her a hug. She said, \u201cI missed you.\u201d I said, \u201cMegan, I missed you too.\u201d She said, \u201cDaddy, how was your big business trip?\u201d I had my suit on and all of that standing above her. I said, \u201cWell, Megan, the trip was good. You\u2019d be pretty proud of the old man.\u201d She said, \u201cI know, Daddy. I saw you on TV today.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, really? So, how\u2019d I look?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, Daddy, you looked really, really,\u201d and I\u2019m thinking powerful or whatever. She said, \u201cDaddy, you looked really, really kind of short.\u201d So, I\u2019m standing there. Now there\u2019s this awkward silence. Now, Megan is also, the master of how to damn with faint praise. So, she looks at me and goes, \u201cBut, Daddy,\u201d and I have this yellow power tie on. She goes, \u201cBut, Daddy, that tie looks really good on TV on camera.\u201d So, I went, \u201cOkay, thanks, Megs.\u201d Tim Ferriss: She\u2019s giving you a criticism sandwich. John Crowley: Oh, yes, always. All day long. She said to me, \u201cAre you going to be here in the morning?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d She said, \u201cWould you take me to school?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, honey, I\u2019ll take you to school.\u201d She said, \u201cGoodnight, I love you.\u201d I said, \u201cGoodnight, I love you.\u201d I walked out and I realized in that moment, Tim, the humility that has to come with any degree of success. Success is pretty fleeting, of course. I realized Megan absolutely, truly did not care that we\u2019d raised a bunch of money, that I was on TV, or that we flew around on a private plane. What she cared about was that her Dad was gone for two weeks on a really long business trip, and that she missed him, and that he was home, and was going to take her to school. I think it that moment I realized, you know what? That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this. For those moments. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned earlier your criteria for selecting a disease to potentially develop a treatment for. I may get the exact word wrong, but it was something along the lines of \u201cmagnitude of impact,\u201d or \u201csignificance\u201d? John Crowley: Sure, or can we have a meaningful impact on a disease. Tim Ferriss: What I\u2019d love to ask is because I think about this from even a philanthropic standpoint or for anyone who\u2019s trying to give back, how do you think about doing the greatest good for the great number of people? If you have say an impact of 0 to 10. I know this may come out a little unformed because \u2013 John Crowley: No, I hear where you\u2019re going. But go ahead, tell me. Tim Ferriss: Is it better to go an inch wide and a mile deep? Or the opposite, in a sense, right? And hit a large number of people. I struggle with this because there are times when I want to, for instance, and I\u2019ve done, I have taught classes in a number of place like Oakland, for instance. Where you\u2019re hitting 10 or 20 students and you might be able to impact them very deeply. Then there are other people who say, well, if you look at effective altruism, what you really should do is just take this amount of money and invest it in malaria nets that are going to go to Africa because dollar for dollar, you\u2019re going to save the greatest number of lives doing that. I struggle with \u2013 and it certainly doesn\u2019t have to be a false dichotomy, right? It doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be either/or, but we only have so, much time and energy to allocate. How do you think about that? John Crowley: Again, so, you take these 7,000 rare diseases \u2013 I mean, the essence of your question is, why rare diseases and why not put the money into much more broadly prevalent? Tim Ferriss: No, it\u2019s even that because this is a purely selfish question. John Crowley: Sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Where I\u2019m trying to understand how you think about \u2013 I like to get advice, quite frankly, as to how I should use my own time. I\u2019m not going to be necessarily \u2013 well, I\u2019m almost certainly not going to be developing any biotech companies, but I think that many people listening to this want to do good in the world and there are many compelling arguments for seemingly incompatible approaches, whether it\u2019s going the effective altruism route or people who say let\u2019s focus on helping the, let\u2019s say, the lowest decile of performers in a school versus the top decile of performers in say an economically disadvantaged location. Because you\u2019ve done a lot of work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which is a massive understatement, obviously. But for those people listening and for me, how would you encourage them to think about giving back or altruism or creating a for-profit company that does good, for that matter? I know that\u2019s a gigantic, multi-faceted question. John Crowley: I\u2019m a big believer in going deep. Don\u2019t go wide. Have the impact, even if it\u2019s on a single individual. Because think about the ripple effects of meaningfully changing somebody\u2019s life? Even one individual, Tim. So, you mentioned the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It\u2019s actually a great example. Make-A-Wish, back in 1980, there was a little boy named Chris Greicius, a 7-year old. Chris had advanced leukemia. He was in Phoenix, Arizona receiving some treatments. Chris was going to die. Some nurses, family members and then police officers heard about it, that Chris always wanted to be a cop when he grew up. So, these cops heard about it and they said let\u2019s help this kid be a cop. They actually made him a little uniform and got the doctor\u2019s permission to take him out of the hospital for the day. They made him a cop. They deputized him with a judge, put the uniform on him. They took him up in the police helicopter. Just a true police officer experience. He went back to the hospital after that day. It was on the local news in Phoenix. It was great. Two days later, Chris Greicius died. He was actually flown back to Illinois where his family was from. He was given a police officer funeral. That made the news as well. About a month or two later, his mom, Linda, got together to thank those police officers who made it happen. They started to think about how he didn\u2019t live long and how tragic it was, but boy, he sure loved that day and that experience. They were so, happy and they realized it made their lives better, the people who gave him that gift, that wish. Then they said, well, why stop? Maybe we can do this for other kids. That\u2019s how the Make-A-Wish Foundation came to be. Because a couple of people just wanted to help one sick little boy. Fast forward 36, 37 years. Make-A-Wish Foundation has granted over a quarter of a million wishes to children that have fundamentally changed their lives and brought joy to people with life-threatening illnesses and the communities that\u2019s affected. So, you can do a lot of good by touching one life. In the rare diseases, what\u2019s so, rewarding about working here is that not only are you working on devastating diseases where yes, you can save people\u2019s lives, you can potentially even one day cure them. That in itself is meaningful. Beyond that, I really believe that by understanding human genetic medicine, understanding what\u2019s causing these diseases and how they may be treated, we\u2019re going to unlock the secrets to treat much more prevalent disorders. You look at a disease like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s, many of the cancers. They\u2019re really just human genetic diseases that we don\u2019t yet completely understand. Think about it. When we started out, we wanted to help our two children. With a lot of people\u2019s help, we were able to affect everybody living with Pompe disease. Now at Amicus, we\u2019re working on multiple rare diseases. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to develop treatments that\u2019ll help people with all of those rare diseases. In the meantime, my big vision for the company is I want to be at the forefront of human genetic medicine, which I believe in the years ahead means that we\u2019re going to be at the forefront of human health. That\u2019s pretty exciting. Tim Ferriss: It is exciting. We were chatting before we hit record and you mentioned that it\u2019s entirely not \u2013 these are my words, not yours \u2013 but that it\u2019s entirely feasible that we might find ourselves living to, say 200 or something like that. There are certainly a lot of people here in Silicon Valley who are pursuing that \u00ad\u2013 [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: \u2013 with all of their energy and resources. What are some of the breakthroughs or potential breakthroughs? Things you think have 50 percent or higher likelihood of happening, that most excite you in the next 10 to 20 years? John Crowley: Yeah, I really think, Tim, that we are on the cusp of a golden age of medicine. We\u2019ve come a long way in the last century. We\u2019ve almost doubled the life expectancy here in the United States. We did that with better hygiene, better nutrition. But the greatest single contributor to expanded life expectancy is medicines. Medicines that are extending and enhancing life. We\u2019ve come a long way. The average life expectancy is almost 80 years now. Why are we programmed to die now at 80, when we were programmed to die at 47 a century ago? We\u2019re not. We intervened. What we\u2019ve effectively done is begun to change the slope of human evolution. So, we now have tools that not only can we provide drugs that can cure an infection or drugs that might prevent or treat heart disease or rare diseases or cancers. We\u2019re now to the point where you look at the gene therapies that are being developed. You look at a new technology of gene editing. Actually, being able to go in and manipulate the human genome in an individual and fundamentally change their health course. Tim Ferriss: And do so, very inexpensively in some cases. John Crowley: In fact, and do so, in a way that you\u2019ve now permanently changed the human germ line so, that genetic change is inheritable to their children. Obviously, profound ethical consequences, but I really believe that if we keep pursuing these technologies, many of which are already in clinical development, that 10, 20 years from now, we can alleviate an enormous amount of human suffering. Now, can we unlock the secrets of aging? Is the aging process itself a disease? In many ways, what happens in aging is more and more of these little mistakes in our DNA happen and over time, they accumulate and over time they lead to cellular inefficiencies. The lead to a lot of misfolded proteins in our body. What if we were able to change that course and do so, where you have good quality of life? Are we getting to this concept of a singularity of man and machine becoming as one? Obviously, many books and some movies written about this. It can be scary, but to me it\u2019s actually unbelievably exciting. If we can do it for the right reasons in the right way to extend and enhance human life, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It kind of gets us back to time. Time and quality of life and that\u2019s pretty darned exciting. Tim Ferriss: On the quality of life front \u2013 just a few more questions \u2013 but on the quality of life front, what does a \u2013 I could pick a single day of the week, but \u2013 what does \u2013 and I\u2019m not in any rush at all, I just want to be cognizant of your time \u2013 that an ideal day. This is a weekday. Ostensibly, there\u2019s some business to be done, but what does your schedule look like for that day? What I\u2019m very curious about is routines. Things that you do habitually. John Crowley: So, I try to get up early. Usually not early enough. I\u2019ll try to get up by 6:00 in the morning. With that, I\u2019ve always got to plan things I\u2019m going to do. Maybe I\u2019ll try to exercise or do that. I don\u2019t always have a set plan every morning. What I find inevitably is that I\u2019m rushing out the door, whether I get up at 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00. So, it\u2019s a little bit different now too, with the kids, John and Megan in college and Patrick a senior in high school. I\u2019ve got a little bit more time in the morning. It used to be just a flurry of activity getting kids ready, nurses coming and going. In between it all, we decided it would be great to get two Jack Russell puppies, because we didn\u2019t have enough activity in the house. I\u2019d say a typical day though for me, Tim, is wake up at 6:00, shower, get ready, catch up maybe 30 minutes on the elliptical, read the headlines of the news, what happened the night before. I\u2019ve got now seven offices in Europe, so, catch up on the emails coming in from Europe. Tim Ferriss: You do this on the elliptical? John Crowley: I\u2019ll do it on the elliptical. Tim Ferriss: Do you use a phone, iPad? What do you use? John Crowley: I\u2019ll use my iPad. Prop it up and just flip through. I\u2019ll download the Wall Street Journal. Look at the Journal, look at The New York Times, flip through emails, get through that, and then get ready and head off to work. Tim Ferriss: What time is that, roughly? John Crowley: I\u2019ll try to leave the house around 7:15 or so. So, try to beat the school traffic in, with all the schools in Princeton. I\u2019ll do that and get in the office. I try to have about an hour of downtime. I try to not run the company by email. I think it\u2019s too easy to get in and say okay, what emails hit since I got off my elliptical? Let me respond to those. I try really hard to limit the email time. I set a block in the morning on the elliptical, a little bit more when I get in the office, and then spend the time with the team, the people. We try really hard in our company with that patient-centric view to bring patients in living with the disease. If you come to our company, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve got portraits and pictures and paintings around of all people living with rare diseases and their stories. We try to bring them and be absorbed in that. Now, we\u2019re also, a public company with a billion-dollar market cap and 300 employees, so, invariably there\u2019s the details and what I\u2019ll call the grind of the business that you\u2019ve got to get through. There\u2019s the invariable demands on your time. I do try, and I don\u2019t succeed more than 50 percent of the time, but I try, and it\u2019s on my calendar every day \u2013 one hour of thinking time. Tim Ferriss: When is that usually scheduled? John Crowley: Usually early afternoon. Tim Ferriss: So, post-lunch? John Crowley: Post-lunch, 1:00, 2:00. It\u2019ll have to vary by certain other commitments, but it\u2019s always on there. I do try to take it as a time to step back and to think, where are we? What have I learned halfway through my day? What do I need to complete by the end of the day? What happened unexpectedly that I have to pivot around? What I also, find though is about 50 percent of the time, there\u2019s such demands on my time that I\u2019ve got to use it for something else. There\u2019s, John, you\u2019ve got to get on a call with this clinical site. Or John, these investors need to talk to you. Do you have time? That\u2019s okay, because rather than every day pivoting things around, at least I know I\u2019ve always got a little bit of flexibility built in. If the kids are home, I try to get home at a decent hour and spend time with them. I get a more intense workout in when I go home. I either go to CrossFit or do something in our basement. Try to do more of a weightlifting workout. Get out the frustration of the day. Tim Ferriss: What might that look like specifically in your basement? What would a Crowley evening workout look like? John Crowley: If I\u2019ve got limited time, 30 minutes, push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and dips. Lots of push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and dips because you can fly through them, great workout and it\u2019s hard to get hurt. If I\u2019ve got more time, I\u2019ll build in some of the bench press, some of the shoulder press. I\u2019ll do kettle bell swings, those types of activities. Try to mimic a CrossFit workout. If I can find the time, at least three days a week I try to get out to CrossFit, when I\u2019m not hurting myself. Tim Ferriss: I was going to say, just to increase your injury potential. John Crowley: Which seems increasingly common. I find as I get older, my strength is about the same as when I was young. My endurance is about the same. I\u2019m much slower and I get hurt way more easily. Then a little bit of dinner, time with the family, wrap up a little email. The last thing I do before I go to bed every night, I pray. Tim Ferriss: What are your typical meals? Do you have default breakfasts and lunches that you have? John Crowley: Almond butter and bananas in the morning. If I can, I\u2019ll take a frozen egg white and throw it in. Tim Ferriss: And you blend that? John Crowley: No. Either/or. No, that actually sounds like it would be kind of gross. Tim Ferriss: What do you do with the frozen \u2013 how do you eat the frozen egg white? John Crowley: You put it in a microwave. What do you think you do? Tim Ferriss: All right. Good God. I thought you were just gnawing on some ice cube of egg. It sounded terrible. John Crowley: I only eat things that are frozen, Tim. Tim Ferriss: Then what does lunch look like? John Crowley: Lunch I try to eat light. We try salad, soup, something like that. My big meal is dinner. Tim Ferriss: What is dinner? John Crowley: So, we try to eat healthy when we stay home. Chicken, fish, steaks. Aileen\u2019s been trying some of these prepared meals, the plated Blue Apron. Those are quite good. But I love pasta. My Grandma was from Sicily. I love pasta. I try to limit it, but probably one or two nights a week, we\u2019ll have a big pasta dinner. Always on Sunday if we can, with family. Kind of an effect of growing up in a big half-Italian family and the Irish side that loved the pasta too. Tim Ferriss: Have you ever struggled with \u2013 well, I\u2019m sure everyone has at some point \u2013 but do you have trouble sleeping? Do you have any insomnia? Does your mind keep going? John Crowley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What have you found to help with that, if anything? John Crowley: I try to stop the email by 9:00 p.m. Sometimes you can\u2019t, but try to stop it by 9:00 p.m. We\u2019ve got operations in Asia as well, so, Asia, United States, Europe. There really is no downtime anymore. But I try to stop it. Then I try not to use electronics after 10:00. No TV, no iPad, no iPhone. I try to read. For me, reading helps. Then as I said, I don\u2019t meditate, but I pray. Tim Ferriss: Is there a set prayer or a go-to prayer that you have or is it different every night? John Crowley: I always start with the Hail Mary. So, for me it\u2019s the Hail Mary and the Our Father. Having grown up in a Catholic family and many Catholic schools, that\u2019s my prayer, my peace time. As I\u2019ve gotten older though, I\u2019ve stopped praying for things. I don\u2019t mean material things, never that. But help with this, help me with that, intervene. Sometimes, yes. I pray for others, yes. What I really try to pray for is, I guess I\u2019d call it peace, grace, strength, and thanks. To me, that\u2019s always a nice way to try to fall asleep. Tim Ferriss: What is grace to you? John Crowley: I think it\u2019s the \u2013 I always ask my kids. I asked them, \u201cAre you happy? Are you safe? Are you fulfilled?\u201d So, to me maybe it\u2019s a combination of all of that \u2013 happy, safe, and fulfilled. Tim Ferriss: If you had a gigantic billboard and you could put a short message on it or image, nothing commercial, to impart to millions of people, what would you put on that? John Crowley: It\u2019s bigger than you. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s bigger than you. John, it\u2019s always so, fun to hang out. John Crowley: Same here also. This was great. Tim Ferriss: We could go for hours and hours. John Crowley: This is our longest conversation without beer. Tim Ferriss: I know. John Crowley: Ever. Tim Ferriss: I know. It is absolutely the longest. I think many more ahead. Is there any request you would like to make of my audience? A suggestion, a recommendation, parting thoughts or comments? John Crowley: I think in the scope of healthcare, because it\u2019s one thing we all deal with, always realize that you have got to be your greatest advocate. No matter how awesome your doctor is, how wonderful your healthcare system is, nobody\u2019s going to wake up thinking, how can I make this person better, healthier, safer, happier, or whatever it may be. So, that importance of being your own patient advocate is just so, critically important. One thing I would ask \u2013 my daughter, Megan, asked for this. She\u2019s just such a remarkable kid, as my boys are too. But Megan is just a really special person. I\u2019ve learned an awful lot from her. Many people have been touched. Just a special human being. I\u2019ve asked if she\u2019d share more of her life perspectives with people because she lives \u2013 most people would look at Megan and think, \u201cGod, this poor little kid. Pity on this young lady.\u201d She doesn\u2019t feel that way. She feels so, blessed and she\u2019s so, happy and so, inspiring and funny as could be. Tim Ferriss: She seems very good at busting your balls. John Crowley: She certainly does, certainly does. Every day. She started a blog just last week. It\u2019s called High Heeled Wheels. Tim Ferriss: High Heeled Wheels. John Crowley: Take a look at it. She\u2019s a remarkable young lady and to gain some of the insights from Megan I find valuable and am just blessed to be able to share with others. Tim Ferriss: High Heeled Wheels the way we would think it to be spelled? John Crowley: That\u2019s exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Okay, great. John Crowley: Megan loves high-heeled shoes, even though she\u2019s never walked a day in her life. That says something about her. Thank you, Tim. This is awesome. Tim Ferriss: Absolutely. Thank you, John, first and foremost. To everybody listening, you can find links to everything we\u2019ve talked about, including High Heeled Wheels, in the show notes for this episode and every other episode at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. John, we have to have more conversations and spend more time together. John Crowley: Yeah, for sure, Tim. Once we cure a few more diseases, let\u2019s come back and talk. Tim Ferriss: Absolutely. As always, to everyone listening, thank you for tuning in and keep experimenting, work smart and play often.

which is now a 300+ person company in 22 countries", "okay, that is the current day", "but his involvement with biotech stems from the 1998 diagnosis of two of his children with pompe disease", "he was surprised with this unexpected diagnosis of a severe and often fatal neuromuscular disorder", "in his drive to find a cure for them, he left his job at the time, became an entrepreneur, then became the co-founder and president and ceo of novazyme pharmaceuticals in 2000, a startup conducting research on a new, experimental treatment for pompe disease, which he credits as ultimately saving

recording", "you were educating me about fast-roping drills and making my hands sweat", "could you please explain", "i said, you know what", "actually pause", "let\u2019s talk about this", "let me record", "can you re-tell what you were describing to me, please", "yeah, and if you remember, this came up in the context of describing fears of heights", "i said despite having served in the military and worked with some amazing people and done some things that i probably shouldn\u2019t have ever been doing, at least at that age, we talked about fast-roping", "so, with a fear of heights, i was being trained with a navy intelligence officer working with a seal team, so, i had the navy seals teaching me how to fast-rope", "okay, great", "they give you the basics and then you go up in this tower", "so, we end up going up", "you climb up these ladders 40 feet", "then there\u2019s a plank and there\u2019s a real salty-looking seal, chief petty officer, handing the rope", "it\u2019s a really uneasy feeling to step out on a plank and grab a rope, even though you think you\u2019re strong enough to hold it and you know the basics and can kind of slide your way down", "just that thought of \u201cmy life is now literally in my hands, literally.\u201d you\u2019re untethered", "you are untethered", "you step out on a rope off away from the platform, you grab the rope and you slide down fast", "and it better be fast because the next guy is above you and if you go too slow, he\u2019s going to come crashing down on you", "so, you\u2019re terrified", "you do it, so, i do it",

evolution", "you finish, they check the box", "training certified at 40 feet", "okay", "so, you think you\u2019ve accomplished something", "and then chief petty officer, chief says, \u201call right",

i\u2019m thinking, i can\u2019t hesitate or it\u2019s \u2013 this isn\u2019t what you do in the special operations world, of course, and i don\u2019t want this chief petty officer seal getting all angry with me", "so, he hands it to me, so, i\u2019m thinking, i\u2019ve got to come up with something to say to try to defer this, at least a few moments", "so, i said, \u201cchief", "quick question.\u201d i said, \u201cany difference between up here versus down there?\u201d 90 feet versus 40 feet", "of course, i meant difference in technique", "i was just trying to make conversation at that point", "he says, \u201coh, yes, sir", "yes, sir.\u201d i said, \u201cchief, what is it?\u201d with all of his wisdom he said, \u201cif you fall down there, you get an open casket.\u201d he hands it to me and he goes, \u201cgo!\u201d thanks, coach", "yeah, thanks", "and thankfully, of course, i survived", "i had great teachers", "good god", "i mean, we were discussing a number of things", "everything is fine", "it\u2019s safe as long as you remain calm", "like most things in life", "that\u2019s how a lot of dangerous things can be presented when we start talking about man on a wire,

sensitive to heights", "that\u2019s part of the reason i took up bouldering and belay rock climbing some time ago, to try to therapeutically fix that", "i haven\u2019t yet succeeded", "i was going to say, how did that work", "it actually helped quite a bit", "i just had to use copious amounts of chalk", "it addressed my perception of danger, but it did not affect the hand sweating", "so, i just used disgusting amounts of chalk, which is true when i deadlift too", "maybe i just sweat a lot in general", "let\u2019s start way back, in the beginning", "i love speaking with my friends in this somewhat unnatural interview format because i get to do the 20 questions that would seem so, odd if i did it at dinner or something like that", "sure, sure", "or that i wouldn\u2019t answer if you did", "or that you wouldn\u2019t answer, right", "so, now compelled by the recorder in front of us, what was your childhood like", "could you describe your family and upbringing", "sure", "i grew up in northern new jersey", "my mom\u2019s family was from italy", "my dad\u2019s family was from ireland", "they were both first generation", "they met when they were young and i was born in 1967", "my dad had served in the marines and was a cop in northern new jersey", "we lived in englewood, new jersey", "just right by the george washington bridge", "from what i remember of the early years, it was pretty nice, fun", "we lived in small, little garden apartments", "in these garden apartments, my dad\u2019s brother lived, who was also, a cop", "my grandfather, the italian from naples, was the superintendent of the apartments", "all my cousins lived there", "it was kind of like a commune, if you were, for the family", "things were good, but there are those things in life that change you or have an impact", "for me, it was in january 1975, when i woke up one morning and learned that my dad who was a copy, my hero, had died on duty the night before", "he was killed in a tragic car accident", "it was super bowl sunday", "life changes a lot", "by that point, we very quickly moved in with my grandparents, who lived the next town over", "we had a 900-square foot home that my grandfather built after world war ii, two bedroom, one bath", "grandma, grandpa, and my then-20-or-so-year-old aunt in one bedroom", "and me, mom and my then-4-year-old brother, i was 7, in the other bedroom, right after dad died", "things change you", "i think it was surrounded by lots of love", "i think what my mom did to keep us together, what my grandparents did, everybody, what the police community did for us, was really remarkable", "those are things you never forget", "i\u2019m so, ashamed that i somehow didn\u2019t know that", "i feel like i should\u2019ve known that and i didn\u2019t", "how is that, if it has, i can\u2019t imagine that it hasn\u2019t, affect the person you are today", "how did that change you", "obviously, you miss your dad a lot", "but i think it forces you to grow up really fast, tim", "for me, it really, i think, was two lessons", "one, that a lot of people may rely on you in life", "for me, it was my then-4-year-old brother", "even my mom, in a way", "she had to go to work", "she went to work", "she\u2019d been a professional administrative assistant earlier in life, then was raising us", "then she had to become a waitress in northern new jersey", "a lot of people i realized at an early age, may rely on me for whatever that may be", "that was one really important lesson", "no", "2 is it\u2019s okay to rely on others", "it\u2019s okay to ask for help", "we did, i did a lot", "those things change and you move on", "[inaudible] you realize you\u2019ve got to be independent", "the world is full of setbacks", "i had a friend years ago, whose dad once told me, \u201clife is a series of challenges and your happiness in life is directly related to how well you deal with those challenges.\u201d that was one really big challenge really early on", "so, we \u2013 i think this is going to be a recurring theme that we\u2019ll come back to quite a bit in this conversation", "but before we go down that route, what were your strengths and weaknesses as a kid or quirks", "i have this picture of like a mini-captain america", "does that sound correct", "really mini", "that\u2019s how i think of you", "i never got past 5\u20196\u201d", "but what were you like at say 10 years of age", "what were your strengths, weaknesses, or any defining behaviors, characteristics", "good student, bad student", "yeah, i was a good student", "i worked hard", "i learned early on in life to study is a road to success", "my grandfather didn\u2019t finish the seventh grade", "even before my dad died, i would spend a lot of time with him", "have you ever been to fort lee, new jersey, and you see those big apartment buildings that rise across the george washington bridge in new jersey", "sure", "when i was a little kid, they weren\u2019t there; that was an amusement park, palisades amusement park", "once of the first buildings that went up, my grandfather was a superintendent", "he was a handyman, he could fix anything", "but my mom was working and somebody had to watch me", "i was, i don\u2019t know, 4 or 5 years old", "i used to go to those apartment buildings with my grandpa", "he\u2019d show up with his toolbox and i\u2019d say, \u201cgrandpa, i want a toolbox, too.\u201d he said, \u201coh, absolutely.\u201d he gave me a toolbox with a couple of real tools in it and i\u2019d go around with him all day long and he\u2019d be fixing dishwashers or door jambs or whatever", "i\u2019d bang a hammer and try to help because boy, i said, \u201cgrandpa, i want either do this or i want to be a cop like dad.\u201d what grandpa did and i didn\u2019t realize it until many years after, was over the course of that year, he would slowly take the tools out of the toolbox and put books in", "after i got bored with swinging a hammer and when i realized, even at 4 or 5 five years old, i wasn\u2019t very good at swinging a hammer, i\u2019d just start reading the books", "i tried to be a good student", "i think i was a pretty decent student", "again, a lot of good teachers along the way", "i tried to be an athlete and i was a perfectly mediocre athlete", "good enough usually to make the team, and never nearly good enough to stand out on it", "what were your sports", "i played baseball and by high school, i wrestled as well", "sports that a guy who\u2019s 5\u20196\u201d and 155 pounds as an adult could play as a kid", "football i played", "i think in fourth grade i went out and made the football team", "i started out as a lineman", "i was about average size maybe in fourth grade", "then everybody kept growing and i wasn\u2019t growing quite as fast as everybody", "so, by fifth, sixth grade i was a linebacker", "then i was a running back", "then i was a free safety", "and by ninth grade, i went to bergen catholic high school in new jersey, football powerhouse", "my sophomore year in high school, they were ranked no", "2 in the nation", "freshman year, i\u2019m going out for the football team", "that lasted about five days", "i realized i love football, but this is not a sport in which i should participate safely", "no matter how calm i tried to be, i should not participate", "you\u2019re looking at a decent student and mediocre athlete", "i always tried to \u2013 friends always made fun of me", "i always seemed to have the hair kind of parted and combed right", "you still do", "well, it\u2019s funny", "my daughter, megan, pointed that out over christmas", "i don\u2019t know \u2013 we were talking about something or other and it was really windy", "i came in and she goes, \u201cohmygod, it can move.\u201d i said, \u201cwhat?\u201d she goes, \u201cyour hair.\u201d she said, \u201ci was told it hadn\u2019t moved since 1968.\u201d so, thanks, meg, that was very thoughtful", "i only wish i could have perfectly parted hair", "alas, my options are limited these days", "jason statham or bust is sort of my motto for styling", "what did you think you were going to be in high school, when you grew up", "what did you think you were going to be", "or hoped to be", "i always had been focused on the military", "i think with my dad being in the marines and my uncle in the navy and their being police officers, there was always that sense of patriotism and responsibility and wanting to serve the country", "i spent a fair amount of time thinking about going in the military in high school", "i also, thought about being a lawyer, even in high school", "how did you decide on college", "actually, before i get to college, did you have any particular \u2013 i\u2019ll ask the same question for college, so, if you want to just skip ahead you can do that \u2013 did you have any particularly impactful mentors or people who left a mark on you in those high school years", "yeah, you know what", "so, i went to bergen catholic high school", "it\u2019s taught by the christian brothers", "they were founded in ireland", "the irish christian brothers", "they\u2019re a good order", "i think they taught us well", "i really can\u2019t point to any one particular person in high school", "i think in terms of a mentor, somebody who taught me about life, for a male role model, it would certainly be my grandfather", "how did you choose where to attend college or how did you end up attending the school you did", "i actually spent the first couple of years of college at the naval academy", "i got an appointment from our senators and that kind of took me on the course in the military", "then again, we make our plans and god laughs", "so, i got to my second year of the naval academy", "after the first year, you go through the physical and they actually check the box", "i couldn\u2019t \u2013 my eyes weren\u2019t 20/20 \u2013 check the box not qualified to fly", "because by then, at 18, 19 years old, i was going to be the world\u2019s greatest f14 pilot", "then boy, that was a real setback", "i was thinking i was going to do this, now i can\u2019t do it", "well, maybe i\u2019ll be a marine out of the naval academy or something else", "then i just started to think about was that the right fit for me in the 19-year-old struggling", "i finally made the decision that i was going to voluntarily resign from the naval academy", "it took me months to come to that decision", "by that point, i\u2019d been accepted to the school of foreign service at georgetown and loved the academics, the curriculum", "aileen was also, then in college", "she was my high school girlfriend and now wife", "the thought of living in washington was attractive", "and i did, with a good degree of hesitation, signed that letter of resignation", "i did put in that letter that someday i would like to wear a uniform again and someday i would like the honor to serve our country", "i left it at that in whenever that was, 1987 or so", "i went to georgetown and finished georgetown", "what did you study at georgetown", "i was in the school of foreign service at georgetown", "i\u2019m going to plead ignorance here", "i should know what that entails and i just don\u2019t", "what\u2019s the curriculum", "what is done at such a place", "it\u2019s one of the four or so, college at georgetown", "bill clinton graduated from the school of foreign service many years before me", "sfs stands for school of foreign service", "we used to say it stood for safe from science", "it had no math and no science requirements", "years back, it was a school set up to train diplomats", "it\u2019s since become a liberal arts college with a strong emphasis on international relations", "i majored in international economics", "an excellent program", "i had phenomenal teachers; people like madeleine albright, jeane kirkpatrick, william colby, who had been director of the cia", "remarkable people, great school", "then from there, i thought maybe i will be a lawyer after all and applied to law schools", "i was accepted to a couple", "one of which was the university of notre dame", "i\u2019d thought about notre dame as a college, but naval academy trumped it and then georgetown for a whole bunch of reasons made sense", "i\u2019ll share this with you", "i\u2019d talked about my dad passing away", "the first time i ever watched \u2013 so, people think notre dame and they think college football or sports", "and yeah, we have great sports and athletics programs at notre dame and certainly great academics", "i didn\u2019t know anything about notre dame beyond that", "as a little kid, the first time i ever watched a football game, i was 7 years old", "my dad said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to watch a football game.\u201d i said, \u201cdad, i don\u2019t want to watch a football game.\u201d he goes, \u201cno, no, it\u2019s notre dame.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cwhat is that?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cwatch.\u201d my dad was one of the subway alums, meaning he never went to notre dame, never went to college, never even went to south bend, indiana, but he just loved the school, loved the spirit of tradition and all that", "so, i kind of whined and complained and i watched it", "it was the sugar bowl", "1975, notre dame versus alabama", "so, we\u2019re watching this game and all of a sudden, i\u2019m cheering", "by the end of it, i\u2019m totally taken in with the mystique of notre dame and the gold helmets", "i just loved these gold helmets", "notre dame wins the game, 13-11 over \u2018bama", "i said to my dad, i said, \u201cdad, this is great.\u201d he smiled and said, \u201cyeah, never forget this.\u201d i said, \u201cdad, i want one of those gold helmets.\u201d he said, \u201ctomorrow we\u2019re going to sears in hackensack, new jersey, and we\u2019re going to get the gold helmets.\u201d great", "so, we go the next day, go to the football section in the athletic department there and i\u2019m looking, \u201cdad, there\u2019s no gold helmet.\u201d he said, \u201cno, no", "this is how you do it.\u201d so, he takes a generic helmet off the shelf, goes to the hardware section, gets a can of gold spray paint and he says, \u201cwe\u2019re going to spray paint it", "that\u2019s how you make a notre dame helmet.\u201d so, we go home, we spray paint it together and i had my notre dame helmet", "that was january 2nd, 1975", "my dad died 10 days later", "ohmygod", "i still have that helmet, tim", "that memory and the affection, affinity, respect for a place like notre dame carried with me", "i came down i had a couple of schools to choose from; notre dame was one of them", "i\u2019d never been to south bend", "i didn\u2019t have the money to go visit by the end of college, literally", "so, i said, \u201cwell, it\u2019s now or never.\u201d so, i checked the box, sent in $100.00 deposit, and said, \u201cwell, i\u2019m going to notre dame law school,\u201d and i did", "i should point out also, that your fondness for notre dame extends to our selection of cable colors for today\u2019s interview", "i have a blue shirt on", "you asked do i want green, orange or yellow", "i said, \u201cwell, yellow looks like gold", "i\u2019ll take blue and gold.\u201d now i\u2019ve really got to love notre dame", "my daughter, megan, is a sophomore there", "we\u2019ll talk more about megan in a little bit", "so, it was great", "i practiced law for a few years after that at a great firm in indianapolis", "i get bored sometimes real easily with things", "what type of law were you practicing", "i was a litigator; i was a trial attorney", "i did that for a couple of years", "great people, great firm", "i was just kind of itching for something else", "on a lark, i applied to business school and the people up at harvard \u2013 i still think it was a clerical error \u2013 but they accepted us", "we were married, aileen and i", "we had a 1-year old, a nice house, nice life in indianapolis", "we picked it all up to move to boston", "it was one of the best decisions we ever made", "why was it such a good decision", "we made some of the greatest friends that we still have today", "what was neat about the business school up there \u2013 what\u2019s, i think, very different about business versus law \u2013 in terms of the education, we spent a lot of time on understanding through the case study method, of course, in business school, how do businesses really work", "at least as best as you can in a case study", "can you describe that", "because i had a professor at princeton, ed zschau, who had a huge impact", "ed\u2019s great, wonderful", "yeah, ed, for those people who don\u2019t know the name, he is just a phenomenal human being and a very eclectic character, which i love", "former competitive figure skater, former congressman, took at least one company, i think a few companies, public", "he was the first computer science professor at stanford, i believe, because somebody didn\u2019t show up to teach it", "he said, sure, i\u2019ll figure out how to teach that course", "he taught a class at princeton in high-tech entrepreneurship after leaving harvard business school", "he used the case study method", "am i saying that correctly", "could you section what that looks like in practice", "right, so, you show up at most colleges, most schools, what do you do", "you go get all your textbooks, right", "at hbs, our first year at the business school, we didn\u2019t have any textbooks", "you instead go to the case distribution office", "i don\u2019t know how they do it now, but 20 years ago, every class was one case", "in your course of two-year study, you will do 800 case studies", "i\u2019ll give an example", "first day, first class, it was technology and operations management", "kind of a tech-ops, manufacturing-type course", "having been a lawyer and spent most of my life avoiding math and science, i get this case", "i\u2019m like, all right, i\u2019ve got to do this", "i\u2019ve got to get it together", "it was a case called donner drilling", "i\u2019ll never forget about it", "a company manufacturing widgets or whatever they\u2019re making", "we had to calculate the optimum through-put for manufacturing for the most cost-effective and efficient manufacturing process", "i\u2019m excited", "i\u2019m like, this is real business", "this is what i came here for", "i\u2019m looking at it and the first thing i look, ohmygod, i\u2019m looking at the math that i\u2019ve got to do on this", "you study this and it\u2019s real life", "it\u2019s an actual case study that a professor, usually with a research assistant, has gone out and interviewed the businessperson, entrepreneur, and taken the issue that they had and distilled it down to a case study for students", "now you prepare", "you go into the class", "80 of us, first-year section", "steve wheelwright \u2013 never forget the name \u2013 great guy, professor out there, the dean of the mba program is teaching it", "just a legend at hbs", "brilliant man", "what they do is they begin with a cold call", "you don\u2019t know \u2013 somebody\u2019s going to get called on", "but unlike in law school, it\u2019s not a quick give and take and multiple cold calls", "every class, one person is selected randomly to begin the case and for a good 20 minutes, lay it out before the class then participates", "one of the great things about business school, especially how they taught it up at hbs is the students are, in many ways, teaching each other", "it\u2019s a discussion", "i get, of course, first class, first case, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we have start us off, john crowley", "john, are you here?\u201d i\u2019m in the top deck and like, oh god", "\u201cprofessor, yes, i\u2019m here.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cjohn, what do you think donner drilling should do?\u201d so, i start laying out a strategy, a plan and he\u2019s up there", "now i\u2019ve got to get to the math", "so, the equation \u2013 he\u2019s putting it all up there on the board", "he\u2019s laying it out", "it just makes no sense, whatever", "he\u2019s a nice guy, very patient", "he starts looking back at me in the class, \u201cuh, okay.\u201d and whenever a professor says, \u201cuh, okay,\u201d you\u2019re probably not going down the right path", "it\u2019s not okay", "so, then finally he starts writing the equations i\u2019m giving him down", "then he just puts the chalk down and turns around and just looks at me", "then i just looked at him and it was this kind of awkward moment", "he just smiles in kind of a fatherly way and i just said, \u201cwell, professor, when i applied, i was told there would be no math.\u201d there\u2019s this awkward moment", "i\u2019m like, nobody\u2019s laughing", "then everybody burst out", "it really diffused the tension, but it\u2019s a great way to learn", "oftentimes we\u2019d have the real executives or entrepreneurs in the class to teach us", "a couple of years after i graduated, they actually wrote an hbs case story about our journey in life", "it\u2019s called \u201ca father\u2019s love.\u201d let\u2019s jump into that", "we can fill in gaps if and as needed", "what does that case study cover", "why did they do a case study", "i graduated business school then in 1997", "but that point, our son, john, was about three years old", "our daughter, megan \u2013 well, john was actually two and a half", "megan was six months old", "so, we had megan while we were in business school", "about six months after we graduated, we realized by a year of age, megan \u2013 we had moved out here to the bay area in california", "life was great", "i had a lot of student loans, but we had a great job, we had a life and this is starting the american dream, if you will", "what were you doing for work at the time", "i worked with a consulting firm out here in the bay area", "doing business strategy, consulting, a lot of hours", "but great people and it was what i signed up for", "what we didn\u2019t sign up for was, by a year of age, we realized our daughter, megan, who was born seemingly perfectly healthy, born at boston at the brigham, wasn\u2019t doing the things that a kid typically does by 9 or 12 months of age", "she wasn\u2019t pulling up in the crib", "she wasn\u2019t taking her first steps", "so, from pediatrician to neurologist to next neurologist, to blood work, to biopsies", "by this point, early 1998, aileen is pregnant with our third child, patrick", "patrick is born march 6, 1998", "seven days later, we were asked to come to the neurologist\u2019s office at oakland children\u2019s hospital across the bay here", "we\u2019re told all the tests came back on megan, who was then 15 months old, and that she had a rare neuromuscular disease called pompe disease", "i\u2019d never heard of it", "there\u2019s no history of it in the family", "aileen and i were silent carriers", "anything person is a carrier, generally, for maybe a dozen or so, serious genetic diseases but it doesn\u2019t manifest until you happen to make a baby with somebody else who has that", "even then, oftentimes, just a one in four chance", "so, no health history in our families", "then i asked the doctor, \u201cis it serious?\u201d he said, \u201cyes, it\u2019s very serious.\u201d his hands are shaking and he\u2019s basically reading a textbook to us describing the disease", "he tells us megan has a genetic defect where she can\u2019t make a certain enzyme and without that enzyme, she can\u2019t break down glycogen stored in the muscle", "which, as you know, is stored until it\u2019s converted to glucose and used as muscle energy", "because of that, it\u2019s ravaging her muscles and now we\u2019re just in shock", "then i said, \u201cdoc, how serious?\u201d he said, \u201ci don\u2019t think she\u2019ll live another year.\u201d then he said \u2013 we had patrick with us", "he was seven days old", "he was in a car carrier", "he said, \u201cand your son, patrick, should be tested too", "there\u2019s a 25 percent chance he may have the disease as well.\u201d i\u2019ve got to tell you, tim, we went through that car ride home \u2013 we were living in walnut creek near oakland at the time \u2013 just in stunned silence", "we then, even just that night, we went through \u2013 walking through the door at the house, seeing megan sitting there in her high chair, i couldn\u2019t even look at her", "we went through that night, the shock, the grief, the denial, a lot of tears", "then aileen went to bed and i stayed up late", "google wasn\u2019t even around, but i did some internet searching", "i found that there was a doctor at duke university", "there was a little bit of research being done", "in fact, he had just published a month earlier a paper showing that he could correct the disease in some animal models of the disease", "i was so, excited and i woke aileen up", "i\u2019m explaining, i\u2019m rattling off this science", "i didn\u2019t know anything about science", "she looked at me like \u201cwhat are you even talking about", "what does it mean?\u201d i said, \u201ci think, aileen, it means there may be some hope.\u201d that was a long day", "it was a friday the 13th", "i\u2019ll never forget", "i cannot even imagine", "that is \u2013 it sounds like the longest of days", "it was the start of many long days, yes", "but it was a long day", "i don\u2019t want to interrupt", "why don\u2019t you tell us the story in a way that makes sense to you to tell it", "of course, this is something that what follows as well has been turned into a book", "it has been turned into a movie", "but for those people who don\u2019t know the context, what happened after that", "so, you know, tim, right at that day, after that friday the 13th after megan was diagnosed, i took the next couple of weeks and really dug deep into what was this disease, this pompe disease that we had never heard of", "it is one of 50 or so, muscular dystrophies", "i started to figure out who are the leading scientists working in it", "there were very few", "a couple here in the states", "principally one at duke university and a team over in rotterdam in the netherlands", "i began to reach out to them", "i began to take megan to see them", "that was hard too because we had a newborn at home, we had a 3-year old at home and i had a job a year out of business school that was expecting me to work 100 hours a week on an easy week", "but this had to take priority", "this was the most urgent, as you can think about, that you could imagine", "i\u2019ll give you the somewhat brief version of it", "we go through all of this", "we find some of the doctors", "we help raise money for some not-for-profit foundations to bring some more research money in", "we raise about $1 million in not-for-profit money in about a year", "i the course of that year though, from megan and then patrick\u2019s diagnosis, which came about a month later confirmed that he had the disease, even though there was only a one in four chance that he would, we were just determined", "i had mentioned that we went through the shock, the grief, the denial, all of that very quickly", "we very quickly settled on determination", "we didn\u2019t know that we could ever change the course of their disease, but i didn\u2019t want to have to live the rest of our lives wishing that we had tried", "we said we would try", "we tried through the not-for-profit world", "we raised money", "we eventually found a researcher with some very exciting science at the university of oklahoma, a medical research center out there", "he couldn\u2019t get any traction raising money", "he wanted to start a small company", "i tried to introduce him to entrepreneurs, funders \u2013 nothing", "by that point, we had already moved back to new jersey", "i was working for a big pharmaceutical company, bristol-myers squibb, a positive in marketing, good health insurance", "i had some great mentors there", "i did not go to bristol-myers to learn kind of a boot camp of how do you run a biotech or biopharma company", "i did it because it was in new jersey, it was a good job, good health insurance, good people", "but at nights and on the weekends, i kept raising money for the not-for-profit, raising awareness of the disease", "in the midst of that, struggling to keep megan and patrick alive", "megan first and then patrick \u2013 her ability to eat went away within a few months", "she had to be tube fed", "her ability to breathe went away by the fall of \u201998", "she had small pneumonia", "she almost died in the hospital", "had to be ventilated and six months later we went through all the same things with patrick", "he had to be ventilated", "within a year, we went from kids that were perfectly healthy, normal, to two little kids who were ventilator-dependent and wheelchair-bound", "science was beginning to show some promise", "but we realized early on that it was going to be a race against time, as much as it was going to be against nature", "after two years of doing that, by 2000 and working at bristol-myers, i had a choice", "either we could do this full-time or we could let nature run its course", "again, we were so, determined", "i quit my job at bristol-myers, joined forces with that scientist at oklahoma", "we started a tiny little biotech company", "i still had all the student loans, but we had a house, had a little bit of equity, the real estate market in new jersey was doing well at the time", "so, of course, what do you do", "we took a home equity loan", "so, the first money into the company, we took $100,000.00 home equity loan", "all the equity in our house", "we thought that would last a long time", "it didn\u2019t", "then met payroll with a visa and a mastercard", "very prestigious venture firms have used their mastercard", "tier 1", "yeah, tier 1", "oh, yeah, top tier", "nea came in right after them", "so, what ended up happening, we started this little company and we started that in march of 2000", "within a year, we had some early success", "yes, i put the early money in", "we then raised angel money", "we raised $1.2 million from 37 individuals", "i mean, literally knocking on doors of people who i thought might be qualified investors", "in oklahoma and new jersey, it was family, it was friends", "we did that \u2013 probably the toughest money i\u2019ve ever raised, but it gave us breathing room, gave us room to do some research", "we began discovering a treatment", "what we had to do was to make an enzyme therapy to basically replace the enzyme that megan and patrick and people living with pompe couldn\u2019t make", "that company ended up become very successful, attracting within a year the attention of a lot of people", "i think it was successful, tim, because we literally did not know what we were doing", "i was 32 years old", "i had some good degrees and an education, but i had no idea how to be an entrepreneur", "i certainly had no idea what you do as a biotech ceo", "so, i made it up", "because of that, we broke so, many of the conventional rules, i think that\u2019s why were able to beat time as well as nature", "by the fall of \u201901, we said, i need more money and i need more manufacturing capabilities to actually make this drug", "it was starting to show some promise in some early science results in the labs", "so, we made the decision that we would sell the company", "we sold it to genzyme, at the time the largest rare disease biotech company in the world", "it was founded by henri termeer, a magnificent entrepreneur with a real passion for people living with these diseases", "but still it was a big company and it was our competitor", "that is what the case study was about", "so, the hbs case study of novazyme, \u201ca father\u2019s love,\u201d was the choice that i had presented to our venture investors one year into that business", "do we sell the company to genzyme", "or do i do a large partnership with a deal that we had negotiated with genentech", "which would have brought them into the rare diseases", "i decided to sell the company to genzyme because i knew at genzyme, as much as i respect genentech, at genzyme this program had to succeed", "so, what we ended up doing is \u2013 why is that", "because for them, rare diseases were there business", "they knew this would become, and it did become, their most development program ever", "hundreds of millions of dollars, a very difficult program, a very difficult drug to make, medicine to make", "lots of challenges", "i stayed at genzyme", "i was senior vice president of therapeutics at genzyme", "can i interject for a second", "by all means", "at this point, were your children already being treated", "no", "got it", "by the time we came to genzyme, genzyme had other pompe drugs in development", "we brought our technologies in", "we had a choice of drugs and technologies", "we ran a series of experiments and we backed one", "there\u2019s one that came from the genzyme science labs", "children began to be treated", "we saw some remarkable results early on", "in pompe disease, not only are the skeletal muscles weak, the cardiac muscle is very weak", "by that point, megan and patrick, who were 4 and 2 or so, years old, not only were their muscles weakening, not only did they need ventilators to breathe, their hearts were so, enlarged that was the most life-threatening aspect of the disease", "just a quick question", "so, glycogen is also, stored in the liver, if i\u2019m remembering correctly", "it is", "glycogen is stored in many places in the body", "so, does it also, cause problems in organs like the liver", "yes", "what you see in the liver is their livers became enormously enlarged", "that wasn\u2019t actually an immediate life-threatening aspect", "the cardiac", "it was the cardiac and then the pulmonary, the breathing", "then, obviously, quality of life with the loss of skeletal muscle strength", "when we were at genzyme, we were moving at full steam", "we had lots of resources, great people", "we had manufacturing facilities", "all the ingredients for success", "beginning to treat kids", "seeing that their cardiac disease was reversed", "in some cases, even seeing strengthening of muscles", "but i couldn\u2019t get my own kids treated", "the protocols that the teams had developed were for younger children", "i\u2019ve got to tell you \u2013 one of my toughest days, tim, was august of 2002", "we were doing a family vacation down at the jersey shore", "still working away, like many people do on vacation", "the day before, we took the kids to the doctor", "they did echocardiograms", "the doctors told us that at that point, megan had about a year to live, patrick maybe six months", "we had a drug", "it was in kids", "it was reversing their heart damage, but my kids weren\u2019t yet on that drug", "the next day, i got a call from a colleague at genzyme, who said that a decision was made", "the next study with the next material would be in pompe infants and he knew my kids wouldn\u2019t qualify", "that was a really tough day", "thankfully, a lot of good doctors, good people at genzyme and eventually a small catholic hospital in new jersey agreed, st", "peter\u2019s university hospital in new brunswick agreed that they would treat our kids", "but that was months and months of back and forth discussion, negotiation", "it makes for some very dramatic scenes in the movie", "geeta anand captures it in her book very well", "then by january of 2003, january 9th, what would\u2019ve been my dad\u2019s birthday, my kids were treated", "they became the 27th and 28th patients in the clinical study", "that was a great day", "so, many things i\u2019d like to ask", "let\u2019s start with what comes to mind, which is, during that period that you just reflected on, just described, that makes for some very dramatic scenes in the movie and certainly compelling reading, and you can answer this however you\u2019d like", "were there any particular negotiations or conversations that were critically important in that period and how did you handle them", "there were many and i handled them poorly", "that was the most desperate i have ever been in my life, tim", "literally our kids\u2019 lives were on the line", "at that point, i could care less about our career", "we were blessed to have actually made some money so, that we had a financial future that was secure for the kids and that was wonderful", "but obviously, the focus was on how do we get the kids treated", "i was so, frustrated that at one point, by september or so, i reached out to doctors who i knew who were going to be a clinical site for the study, asked them to treat my kids to set up a protocol for them", "i went down, i did it, it was at the university of florida", "it made great sense, scientific sense, but it didn\u2019t follow the protocols within the company", "i thought at that point, you know what", "better to ask forgiveness than permission", "let\u2019s just get it set up, take the heat, heck, they could fire me", "i don\u2019t care", "when people found out, it was a very difficult day and made for a lot of tension", "any trust that was there was then broken", "for me, i felt it was worth the risk", "i took the risk and i lost", "we weren\u2019t allowed to do it", "there were a lot of conversations in the company and usually i fought it for a week or so, and then realized at that point, i\u2019ve taken this as far as i can, now it\u2019s out of my hands", "and so, i stepped back", "they went to a hospital", "that hospital then actually \u2013 i said okay, i\u2019m not going to run this", "we\u2019ll let others run it", "then the fda was comfortable, genzyme the company was comfortable, this large, academic teaching institution, their institutional review board that approves clinical studies would not approve it because the study included children of an executive of the company whose drug was being studied", "so, now i\u2019m like, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me", "that then became not only a hard day for me and aileen and the family, that was a hard day for my colleagues at genzyme because they were fighting very hard to get our kids treated at that point", "by that point, i had really just \u2013 i don\u2019t want to say given up \u2013 but prayed a lot, fought a lot, spent a lot of time with the kids", "then right around thanksgiving, we learned that they were able to meet with an expert who knew the disease who was at st", "peter\u2019s hospital in new brunswick, new jersey, and they were going to present it to their institutional review board for approval", "i learned about it, was thankful, hopeful, prayerful, but just to make sure, i resigned", "i quit", "i did that the day before the hospital review board met", "i didn\u2019t think it would be an issue", "it wasn\u2019t an issue", "but i didn\u2019t want anybody to make an issue out of it", "so, i quit and i waited to hear", "we got a card, a letter \u2013 first a phone call then a letter came christmas eve", "it was a christmas card, a beautiful picture of the blessed mother on the cover, with a copy of the hospital letter approving the study for pompe disease at their center that would include our kids", "that was the best christmas present we\u2019ve ever gotten", "how did you respond to that", "how does one \u2013 i can\u2019t even fathom", "i got the mail that day", "it was christmas eve", "i looked at it and i read it, i cried", "i wanted to run in and share it with aileen", "i wanted to share it with megan, with patrick", "i said, i\u2019m going to wait a little bit", "we had family, we had aileen\u2019s family, her mom and dad, my mom coming over for christmas eve dinner", "so, they came over and we had a glass of wine and were celebrating and nice christmas and poppy, the kids\u2019 grandfather, read \u2018twas the night before christmas", "i was just dying to share this", "i was in a really good mood", "aileen didn\u2019t know why i was in such a good mood", "she figured it was the cabernet maybe", "then we sat down at dinner", "we said grace and i said, \u201ci have something else to share.\u201d i read the card and the letter", "that was a good christmas eve", "that\u2019s a good night", "that was a good night", "that is a good night", "i\u2019m going to backtrack for a second", "you mentioned something i\u2019d love to get just a few examples of", "you said, \u201cwe broke a lot of conventional rules,\u201d because in a sense you didn\u2019t know any better", "that\u2019s right", "what were some of the conventions that you broke or the things you did differently", "when you\u2019re developing a drug, one of the things you need to do is, you kind of go through these rigorous series of experiments to show in animal models of the disease that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s actually working", "is it getting to the muscles in this disease", "is it breaking down the glycogen so, the animals get stronger", "typically, you\u2019ll do that at outsourced companies", "these are the experts", "it takes quite a bit of time", "done, again, in a very rigorous fashion", "once we had made a little bit of that enzyme in the lab, i was just dying to see, is this going to work", "the nih had genetically engineered mice to not express the protein to give them the pompe disease, which my daughter megan still thinks is the meanest thing imaginable", "it\u2019s done very ethically", "we had these animals", "i had the enzyme", "i was with one of my colleagues, who is a senior vice president in my then 11-person company, because you\u2019re either a vp or you weren\u2019t in the company", "he said, \u201ci used to be a hospital tech", "i could do this.\u201d i said, \u201cwell, yeah, let\u2019s try it.\u201d so, when you do this, you\u2019ve actually got to hit a really narrow vein in the tail of these animals to give it the injection", "that\u2019s a really tough stick", "so, my buddy, who hasn\u2019t drawn blood in about ten years, he\u2019s there", "we do put gloves on in the lab", "he puts a little bit of the enzyme into the mouse", "i look at him and he looks at me and he goes, \u201ci think i got it in.\u201d okay", "so, we do that once a week for four weeks and then our scientists sacrifice, grind up the tissues", "that\u2019s not how you do animal experiments", "i can assure you that study failed", "i can give you a whole bunch of reasons why it failed", "so, those are the hard lessons of things you shouldn\u2019t do", "there were things though that we did that were successful", "one of the things we did, i knew we had to make this drug in a way that we can deliver it to humans", "so, what\u2019s known as a gmp facility \u2013 good manufacturing practice", "good manufacturing practice, exactly", "you\u2019re familiar", "we actually invested and made a plant", "i couldn\u2019t build a green field plant", "it costs too much, takes forever", "i met some entrepreneurs who had just begun to develop a system of basically building a building within a building; a clean room", "we could do it for a couple of million dollars and we had raised about $27 million at that point", "we did that", "we did it at risk", "we didn\u2019t have the definitive proof of concept in animals", "but we did it very smart, very fast, and very effectively", "although we never made the enzyme in that plant because by that point i realized i probably need a bigger plant, given the scale of what we needed to manufacture", "had we done it, it could\u2019ve gotten us in the clinic", "where that was successful was it gave me a fallback, if any of these partnerships or the acquisition didn\u2019t work, and when i negotiated the deal, instead of the big company on the other side saying, \u201cyou need us because you can\u2019t make it,\u201d i could take it and say, \u201cyes, i can make this", "look at this.\u201d that was pretty unusual", "people usually don\u2019t make those levels of investments and do it in a very unconventional way", "that was a good decision", "lots of bad decisions, but that was a good one", "now your children are healthy", "so, megan and patrick began receiving that enzyme therapy", "it\u2019s an every other week, iv-administered therapy designed to replace the enzyme that they\u2019re missing", "they started that in january of \u201903 and then we waited", "we got the first results back in early april", "the doctor came in with a smile and megan was sitting up in bed", "before she even got to the echocardiogram reports, she turned on the x-ray, the light box, had two x-rays", "one of megan of her upper body, and you saw this \u2013 you didn\u2019t need to be a cardiologist \u2013 you s aw this enormously enlarged heart", "that was before her treatment 12 weeks ago", "then she put up the one that was taken earlier that day", "it was night and day", "her heart had shrunken back to normal", "i took it to megan\u2019s bedside, showed her, explained, and she was all of 5 or 6 years old at the time", "i explained to her", "she was a kindergartener", "i said, \u201cmegan, this means you\u2019re going to live to be an old lady.\u201d she looked at me and put her arm around me and gave me a big hug and a kiss and just said, \u201cthank you.\u201d biotech is a really tough business, tim", "almost everything we try, it doesn\u2019t work", "but when it does work, it really is the best job you can have", "so, the medicine fixed the kids\u2019 hearts", "for a while it made them stronger, particularly megan", "but after about a year or so, the strength improvements plateaued", "then slowly began to regress", "a year into treatment, they were much better", "their lives were saved", "we realized it was an effective first-generation treatment, but it wasn\u2019t a cure", "what i realized then at that point, was i think we just bought a lot of time and some quality of life for the kids", "they\u2019re still on ventilators, still in wheelchairs, but it helped them enormously", "i realized then, i think we have to go do this again", "we need to find next-generation therapies, newer, potentially better medicines", "that\u2019s what led me to found this company, amicus, in 2005", "do it again", "how are your kids today", "the kids today \u2013 megan just turned 20", "patrick is 19 in march", "they\u2019re 15 months apart", "patrick is a senior in high school and megan is a sophomore at notre dame", "have many people like her gone through notre dame before", "with notre dame\u2019s mission, it\u2019s certainly welcoming of people who are intellectually capable of the rigorous academics, but who have disabilities", "at notre dame, we\u2019ve had kids go through, we\u2019ve had blind students, deaf students", "there was a young man, matt swinton, who graduated with spinal muscular atrophy a number of years ago, duchenne boys", "people with severe difficulties", "megan is the most physically challenged student ever to go through notre dame", "she is the only student to have to live in a wheelchair, on a ventilator, with 24/7 nursing", "so, after she was admitted, she was hesitant to go so, far away to school", "i said, \u201cmegan, if that\u2019s where you think you want to go, we will make this happen.\u201d then i called folks i know at notre dame who i know and i said, \u201cokay, megan\u2019s coming", "what are we going to do?\u201d they said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry", "we\u2019ll do whatever we need to do.\u201d i\u2019ve got to tell you, tim, they stepped up", "the ladies\u2019 dorm that she lives in, ryan hall, was designed to be handicapped accessible", "it had handicapped-accessible suites", "they combined suites for megan", "they made every door of every building that she needs access to across campus accessible on her key fob", "they\u2019ve adjusted her class schedule", "they\u2019ve provided aides and tutors", "it was still a big show getting her out to south bend", "where i was most proud, i told megan, \u201cif you get in, we\u2019ll get you there and we\u2019ll make sure with the university\u2019s help that we get you through.\u201d when we showed up, lots of getting used to", "the nurses who came out to help, they were all going to college again", "they were excited, but apprehensive", "we had planned for almost everything we could", "i had the nurse schedule, the hospital supply, they had the hospital bed moved in", "megan wants to live a full college life", "she wants to be in the dorms, so, she was in the dorms", "one thing we hadn\u2019t thought about is megan\u2019s a 20-year-old young lady now", "weighs about 100 pounds", "while you only need one nurse there to care for her, it takes two people to transfer her in and out of her wheelchair", "i hadn\u2019t thought about who that second person\u2019s going to be", "when i was in her dorm that second weekend, i was looking", "i didn\u2019t even think about it", "i saw the nursing schedule on the board and then i saw a schedule next to it", "it was students who had signed up in her dorm to be there seven times a day at specific times to get megan in and out of her wheelchair", "wow, that gives me some hope for humanity", "there are some great kids, indeed", "how have you raised your kids", "specifically, you can make it more generic if you\u2019d like, but what do you think the principles of good parenting are", "i would say that we raised our kids, and my daughter megan would say that she raised us", "somewhere in between lies the truth", "some of the basic rules in life you want to teach them", "you try to teach them about hard work, about independence", "one thing that\u2019s remarkable though, i\u2019ve learned with kids with special needs, and i\u2019ve seen it not just with our kids, but lots of kids we\u2019ve met over the years, and different from adults i\u2019ve known who suffer with some awful diseases", "these kids who live with these rare diseases, kids who live with cancers, they never feel sorry for themselves", "that\u2019s something aileen and i as parents could never teach them", "it just has to be part of who the are", "i\u2019ve seen that measure of resilience in these kids", "i\u2019ve seen it in our kids in spades", "i\u2019ve certainly seen it in many other children with a lot of rare and devastating diseases", "because of that, i kid around that megan says she raised us, but i have to tell you, for the things that we\u2019ve tried to teach our kids about working hard and independence and one of the lessons i try to teach our kids is that it\u2019s bigger than you", "whatever \u201cit\u201d may be", "whatever you\u2019re working on, it\u2019s bigger than you", "could you give me an example where that might apply", "or just describe what you mean by that", "yeah, so, we often get enveloped in our own little universes", "even when we think we\u2019re helping others, sometimes we think a little bit too much about ourselves in the process", "i try to teach our kids that there\u2019s a bigger purpose to life", "i\u2019ll give you an example", "we took our son, john \u2013 now john does not have pompe disease", "but john has asperger\u2019s", "john has his own challenges", "we tried to raise him with a spirit of that sense of faith and community and a bit of giving back to others", "most parents do that", "i took him down when he was little, every year to washington, d.c", "we do a father-son trip", "i\u2019d take him to the memorials and the monuments and every year i\u2019d always take him to arlington national cemetery", "we were there one year and they were doing a special service and it was to recognize wounded warriors", "it was right at the start of the iraq war", "it was 2003", "there was a young man there who\u2019d lost both his legs, a 19-year-old corporal in the marine corps", "they were giving a speech and people going on", "i looked at john and his eyes were wandering", "he\u2019s got adhd and i was wondering, is he getting it", "i looked at him and i said, \u201cjohn, do you know what they\u2019re talking about?\u201d he said, \u201cyes, daddy.\u201d \u201cwhat are they talking about?\u201d he said, \u201cthat young man fought for our country", "he lost his legs and all these people in this cemetery lost their lives", "he is a hero and they are heroes.\u201d i just thought okay, he got it", "in his own way, with his own special needs, he was able to articulate that it\u2019s bigger than him", "what would your advice be to parents, and there are almost certainly parents listening who either have kids with special needs or who will have kids with special needs, what would you say to them", "what would your advice or otherwise be that you\u2019d want to convey to them", "we tried really early to be a so-called normal family", "i could tell you there\u2019s a lot of times early in life where i wanted, we wanted to have \u201cnormal kids.\u201d sometimes i was mad and angry and frustrated", "sometimes i behaved very irresponsibly because i wanted a normal family", "i wanted to do normal things", "i wanted to just be able to take the kids and go to burger king at night", "go to the movies", "things that all of our friends and many of our friends were doing", "then i realized that \u2013 and i tried teaching this to the kids \u2013 we\u2019re all different", "we\u2019re all special", "megan and patrick, people may look at the two of them and i tell them, \u201cyes, people can look at you and realize you\u2019re different, but it\u2019s these differences in life that make us so, special.\u201d we talk about, obviously racial diversity and sexual orientation, whatever it may be", "that\u2019s part of the richness, the fabric of life", "but it took me a while, even as a parent of actually three special needs kids, to realize that\u2019s a gift in itself and it adds to the diversity in life", "we talked about 2002, how that was a really tough year", "right after that beach trip, after the kids were diagnosed, i thought, \u201cmy, god", "megan\u2019s only going to live a few months, what do we do?\u201d aileen said, \u201chere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do", "we\u2019re going to send her to kindergarten because that\u2019s what kids do when they\u2019re 5 years old.\u201d i pushed back and then finally said, \u201cokay, let\u2019s see.\u201d so, we called the local school", "we had just to princeton", "we said \u201chi, we\u2019re the crowleys", "we\u2019re here", "we\u2019ve got to register our daughter, megan, for kindergarten", "by the way, she\u2019s got this little issue you should probably know about.\u201d they were like, okay", "so, they came and they visited", "the principal, the child study team", "they met megan and they came back, the principal called me a day later and said \u201cjohn, great young lady", "i just don\u2019t think our public school is equipped for megan", "we\u2019ve never had a kid on a ventilator with a nurse and in a wheelchair.\u201d especially a kid, and i didn\u2019t even tell him, who may only live 6 or 12 months", "bob ginsburg, wonderful principal, i said, \u201cbob, i really think that she thrives around being with kids, with people", "i don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s going to live", "i hope a long time but i don\u2019t know", "would you please give it a shot?\u201d he said, \u201cokay.\u201d thought about it, called me back and said, \u201cokay, megan can come to kindergarten", "but john, would you do me a favor", "would you come in and talk to all the parents of the incoming kindergartners to dispel any myths, rumors, whatever", "i did that", "i came in, told them what pompe disease is, told them your kids can\u2019t catch it", "everybody kind of looked at me and shrugged and kind of half-smiled", "i figured okay, i bored them, but i did my job", "megan started kindergarten", "kindergarten year was great for megan", "she loved it", "the gym teacher made up special routines for her in the wheelchair", "she was going to birthday parties", "in the middle of that kindergarten year, she started getting that medicine, such that by the second half of kindergarten, she was so, much stronger", "then you go to kindergarten graduation", "we get there and these kids, they get the little hats and diplomas and it\u2019s really cute", "it\u2019s fun for any parent and special for any little kid", "then megan was called to get hers", "she got a lot of extra applause", "i was really proud", "then the principal came over to me and said, \u201cjohn, can i talk to you?\u201d i said, \u201csure.\u201d he goes, \u201cmegan had a great year", "you were right.\u201d i said, \u201cyes, thank you so, much", "what you did was remarkable,\u201d and it really was", "he said, \u201cbut i want to share something with you.\u201d he said, \u201cright after you gave that talk eight months ago, i got a lot of phone calls and letters and emails from those parents", "the message was all the same", "it was basically, \u2018look, beautiful young lady", "we feel so, sorry for her", "but kindergarten is such an important year and my son or my daughter just won\u2019t be able to learn in that environment", "could you please not put my child in that girl\u2019s class?\u2019\u201d i\u2019m looking at him and i\u2019m thinking, first of all, your feelings are hurt", "then you feel sorry for your kid that somebody would think that of them", "then he looks at me and he says, \u201cjohn, i tell you this for a reason.\u201d he said, \u201cin the last few weeks, i\u2019ve gotten an awful lot of letters and calls and emails.\u201d now i\u2019m thinking, how is he going to tell me that she can\u2019t go to first grade here", "he said, \u201cthe message is all consistent, it\u2019s all the same", "it\u2019s \u2018dr", "ginsburg, we know it\u2019s difficult and this is hard to ask, but our son or our daughter learned so, much and had such a great time with megan in kindergarten, if there\u2019s any way that they can be in her first-grade class, we\u2019d owe you the world.\u2019\u201d then you get emotional thinking about it", "then i thought, you know, megan was just trying to be a normal kindergartener", "she didn\u2019t have to teach those kids", "what i\u2019ve found is first day, kids ask, came up and kind of looked at her funny and said, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she said, \u201coh, i have a disease", "my legs and arms don\u2019t work, but my mind does.\u201d they\u2019d look", "they\u2019d shrug their shoulders and say \u201cokay", "you want to go play a game?\u201d kids got over it in like 30 seconds", "the parents were the ones who had the problem", "think about it", "what ended up happening was megan, without ever knowing it, by her example and by just being a kid, taught those big people a really important lesson", "i think it was a real lesson about the importance of diversity and what people with special needs and physical disabilities, whatever the challenge in life physically or medically may be, can bring such a richness to the lives of others", "for me as a parent, that was a real lesson that little people can teach us big people an awful lot if we just listen", "maybe it is true that everything you needed to learn in life you needed to learn in kindergarten", "i was at the bad table a lot in kindergarten", "well, actually, no", "i got in a fight and i had to write a letter which was apologizing for punching some other kid in the privates", "my mom kept this letter", "i was put at the bad table and then i didn\u2019t do anything bad, but the teacher forgot it was the bad table", "so, i just sat there all year", "so, you can say, psychoanalyze that", "who knows where that has led", "yeah, this explains a lot, tim, you realize", "it clears up a lot for a lot of listeners", "it was dennis and myself were the two kids isolated at the bad table", "the teacher forgot it was the bad table", "i wanted to ask you about the challenge, perhaps, of trying to help kids with rare diseases", "i ask because here we are sitting in silicon valley in san francisco right now and the first thing many entrepreneurs do is, or one of the first things, is they think about their total addressable market for a given product or service", "how does one create a company that is economically viable when trying to develop drugs or treatments for rare diseases", "is it a matter of having a larger portfolio of different diseases", "how does that work", "sure", "so, there are 7,000 known rare diseases that together just in the united states, affect about 30 million people", "individually, by definition, rare", "taken together, they\u2019re actually more prevalent than all hiv and all cancers combined", "the challenge, of course, is they\u2019re all unique and they all need their own unique medicines", "what we typically do is we\u2019ll begin with is it a rare disease", "if it is, how rare is it", "when we first got into this, it used to be if a disease was below 5,000 or 10,000 prevalence, it was just too small", "there was no economic model to sustain it", "it\u2019s now come down though, i think with the advancements in technology, with regulatory science just beginning to understand faster paths to approve these medicines", "that now is coming down to probably around 500 or 1,000", "you have a disease with, call it 500 or 1,000 or more patients", "you can build an economic model to support that", "for us, when we look at will we work in a rare disease", "it\u2019s is it devastating", "do we have a technology that can apply", "can that technology make a meaningful difference for these patients", "the last thing we look at is, how many patients have the disease", "with that model, you can get to many of these diseases", "not all", "we can\u2019t figure out yet what do you do with these rare diseases that affect 5, 10, 100 patients", "there, nih, other areas could fill in the gap perhaps", "but we can make a big dent in it", "what keeps you going at this point", "what are your main drivers", "it\u2019s not a lot different than it was 10 or 20 years ago", "in business, now that we\u2019ve got amicus, and the whole notion there is we were going to make medicines for rare diseases, devastating disorders", "how did you choose the name", "amicus in latin, of course, means \u201cfriend.\u201d we wanted the company to be the most patient-centered biotech company in the universe", "we thought well, if you\u2019re going to be \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of great names in biotech companies", "they\u2019re all usually named after greek gods of healing or complex science names", "we thought friend biotechnologies just sounded a little too cute, but if you latin-ed it up a little bit, all of a sudden, amicus, it\u2019s got some weight, some gravitas", "it\u2019s very high-brow", "yeah, it\u2019s very sophisticated", "but if you look at it, it just means friend", "got it", "i took you off your train of thought though", "not at all", "you were just describing \u2013 let me try to rewind my brain here", "you asked what keeps me going", "right, and you said it hasn\u2019t changed much", "it hasn\u2019t changed much", "for me, it was a focus on how can you, as an entrepreneur \u2013 because i\u2019m not a scientist", "i\u2019ve learned a lot of science over the years", "years ago, i hired tutors at night to teach me science", "so, being immersed in the field, you have to learn it", "for me, it\u2019s how can you use the vehicle of entrepreneurship to drive medicine", "i\u2019ve always believed if you make great medicines, push science as far and as fast as you can, you\u2019ll figure the business model out", "you\u2019ll make great value", "you look at the great biotech companies today, the genentech\u2019s out here, the amgen\u2019s, genzyme\u2019s, they all started the same way", "they started with a couple of scientists, a couple of venture capitalists and some entrepreneurs", "every great biotech company", "you can\u2019t point to one that was a spin-out or a bunch of mergers", "they started that way", "that\u2019s what i\u2019ve tried to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do at amicus now", "one difference is early in my career, with the first company at novazyme, i thought it was a sprint", "in some respects, it was", "now that the kids have a medicine, even though it\u2019s not a cure, and not, i don\u2019t think, the best, most effective treatment, it\u2019s now enabled me to change my view, tim, that it\u2019s a marathon", "with that, we guess we can move incredibly fast, but we can look for the best science and push it for pompe disease or for any disease that we\u2019re looking at", "if we do that, we can do some, and have done, some really great things", "how and when did the military re-enter the picture", "september 11th", "after 9/11, i though maybe i have some skills and certainly have a lot of passion and two hands that i can contribute", "i went through the whole process and was commissioned an officer in the navy reserve a couple years after september 11th", "i actually was sworn into the navy by my naval academy roommate, ed devinney, who was a navy commander at the time", "it just so, happened \u2013 i didn\u2019t realize it, but they told me the office after i went through the two-year application process and because i was becoming an intelligence officer a year-long background check", "so, i miraculously passed the background check and they gave me all the top secret and other clearances", "then i got this letter saying report on such-and-such date for your swearing in", "i called the officer in charge", "i said, \u201chey, would it be okay if commander devinney,\u201d now he\u2019s pretty high-ranking in the navy at this point, \u201cwas there to swear me in?\u201d this young officer said, \u201cwell, yeah, of course.\u201d he gave me the address", "some street, lower manhattan", "i didn\u2019t realize it was a navy reserve recruiting office overlooking the world trade center site", "wow", "yeah, that was pretty emotional", "now, i\u2019ll try to tread carefully here", "i don\u2019t want to get into territory that you can\u2019t talk about", "you\u2019ve had experiences with elite units", "would that be a fair phrase to put it", "a fair way to put it", "i\u2019m wondering what you think the characteristics are", "because if we look back to baseball and so, on, you\u2019re like, \u201cwell, i was 5\u20196\u201d, 150 pounds, i wasn\u2019t the super athlete.\u201d what are the characteristics you think that have made you successful in that world as well and capable", "i was fortunate in the military in the 11 years i spent in the navy reserve, tim, as an intelligence officer", "i was assigned for most of that time to the joint special operations commander, jsoc", "i got to work with some of the most elite units in our military", "you talk about serving in the company of heroes", "these men and women are just remarkable", "i was fortunate enough to have co-workers at amicus as we started that, and then even as a public company, there was a time i was told i was the only public company ceo was an active-duty reservist in the country",

years of effort and a big experiment that failed, what did you do", "he said, \u201ci thought about it", "i thought about how i\u2019m going to tell my family, my co-workers, the people who put the money into this, that it didn\u2019t work", "so, i walked, i went to a park,\u201d he said, \u201cand i thought about what i what\u2019s going to say.\u201d i read it in this article, tim", "he said,

discipline", "you can do it through focusing more on certain activities in life that require sacrifice", "that\u2019s all true and i think that\u2019s all an element of it", "what i\u2019ve come to

she missed him, and that he was home, and was going to take her to school", "i think it that moment i realized, you know what", "that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this", "for those moments", "you mentioned earlier your criteria for selecting a disease to potentially develop a treatment for", "i may get the exact word wrong, but it was something along the lines of \u201cmagnitude of impact,\u201d or \u201csignificance\u201d", "sure, or can we have a meaningful impact on a disease", "what i\u2019d love to ask is because i think about this from even a philanthropic standpoint or for anyone who\u2019s trying to give back, how do you think about doing the greatest good for the great number of people", "if you have say an impact of 0 to 10", "i know this may come out a little unformed because \u2013 no, i hear where you\u2019re going", "but go ahead, tell me", "is it better to go an inch wide and a mile deep", "or the opposite, in a sense, right", "and hit a large number of people", "i struggle with this because there are times when i want to, for instance, and i\u2019ve done, i have taught classes in a number of place like oakland, for instance", "where you\u2019re hitting 10 or 20 students and you might be able to impact them very deeply", "then there are other people who say, well, if you look at effective altruism, what you really should do is just take this amount of money and invest it in malaria nets that are going to go to africa because dollar for dollar, you\u2019re going to save the greatest number of lives doing that", "i struggle with \u2013 and it certainly doesn\u2019t have to be a false dichotomy, right", "it doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be either/or, but we only have so, much time and energy to allocate", "how do you think about that", "again, so, you take these 7,000 rare diseases \u2013 i mean, the essence of your question is, why rare diseases and why not put the money into much more broadly prevalent", "no, it\u2019s even that because this is a purely selfish question", "sure, yeah", "where i\u2019m trying to understand how you think about \u2013 i like to get advice, quite frankly, as to how i should use my own time", "i\u2019m not going to be necessarily \u2013 well, i\u2019m almost certainly not going to be developing any biotech companies, but i think that many people listening to this want to do good in the world and there are many compelling arguments for seemingly incompatible approaches, whether it\u2019s going the effective altruism route or people who say let\u2019s focus on helping the, let\u2019s say, the lowest decile of performers in a school versus the top decile of performers in say an economically disadvantaged location", "because you\u2019ve done a lot of work with the make-a-wish foundation, which is a massive understatement, obviously", "but for those people listening and for me, how would you encourage them to think about giving back or altruism or creating a for-profit company that does good, for that matter", "i know that\u2019s a gigantic, multi-faceted question", "i\u2019m a big believer in going deep", "don\u2019t go wide", "have the impact, even if it\u2019s on a single individual", "because think about the ripple effects of meaningfully changing somebody\u2019s life", "even one individual, tim", "so, you mentioned the make-a-wish foundation", "it\u2019s actually a great example", "make-a-wish, back in 1980, there was a little boy named chris greicius, a 7-year old", "chris had advanced leukemia", "he was in phoenix, arizona receiving some treatments", "chris was going to die", "some nurses, family members and then police officers heard about it, that chris always wanted to be a cop when he grew up", "so, these cops heard about it and they said let\u2019s help this kid be a cop", "they actually made him a little uniform and got the doctor\u2019s permission to take him out of the hospital for the day", "they made him a cop", "they deputized him with a judge, put the uniform on him", "they took him up in the police helicopter", "just a true police officer experience", "he went back to the hospital after that day", "it was on the local news in phoenix", "it was great", "two days later, chris greicius died", "he was actually flown back to illinois where his family was from", "he was given a police officer funeral", "that made the news as well", "about a month or two later, his mom, linda, got together to thank those police officers who made it happen", "they started to think about how he didn\u2019t live long and how tragic it was, but boy, he sure loved that day and that experience", "they were so, happy and they realized it made their lives better, the people who gave him that gift, that wish", "then they said, well, why stop", "maybe we can do this for other kids", "that\u2019s how the make-a-wish foundation came to be", "because a couple of people just wanted to help one sick little boy", "fast forward 36, 37 years", "make-a-wish foundation has granted over a quarter of a million wishes to children that have fundamentally changed their lives and brought joy to people with life-threatening illnesses and the communities that\u2019s affected", "so, you can do a lot of good by touching one life", "in the rare diseases, what\u2019s so, rewarding about working here is that not only are you working on devastating diseases where yes, you can save people\u2019s lives, you can potentially even one day cure them", "that in itself is meaningful", "beyond that, i really believe that by understanding human genetic medicine, understanding what\u2019s causing these diseases and how they may be treated, we\u2019re going to unlock the secrets to treat much more prevalent disorders", "you look at a disease like parkinson\u2019s and alzheimer\u2019s, many of the cancers", "they\u2019re really just human genetic diseases that we don\u2019t yet completely understand", "think about it", "when we started out, we wanted to help our two children", "with a lot of people\u2019s help, we were able to affect everybody living with pompe disease", "now at amicus, we\u2019re working on multiple rare diseases", "hopefully we\u2019ll be able to develop treatments that\u2019ll help people with all of those rare diseases", "in the meantime, my big vision for the company is i want to be at the forefront of human genetic medicine, which i believe in the years ahead means that we\u2019re going to be at the forefront of human health", "that\u2019s pretty exciting", "it is exciting", "we were chatting before we hit record and you mentioned that it\u2019s entirely not \u2013 these are my words, not yours \u2013 but that it\u2019s entirely feasible that we might find ourselves living to, say 200 or something like that", "there are certainly a lot of people here in silicon valley who are pursuing that \u00ad\u2013 [crosstalk] \u2013 with all of their energy and resources", "what are some of the breakthroughs or potential breakthroughs", "things you think have 50 percent or higher likelihood of happening, that most excite you in the next 10 to 20 years", "yeah, i really think, tim, that we are on the cusp of a golden age of medicine", "we\u2019ve come a long way in the last century", "we\u2019ve almost doubled the life expectancy here in the united states", "we did that with better hygiene, better nutrition", "but the greatest single contributor to expanded life expectancy is medicines", "medicines that are extending and enhancing life", "we\u2019ve come a long way", "the average life expectancy is almost 80 years now", "why are we programmed to die now at 80, when we were programmed to die at 47 a century ago", "we\u2019re not", "we intervened", "what we\u2019ve effectively done is begun to change the slope of human evolution", "so, we now have tools that not only can we provide drugs that can cure an infection or drugs that might prevent or treat heart

things", "i don\u2019t mean material things, never that", "but help with this, help me with that, intervene", "sometimes, yes", "i pray for others, yes", "what i really try to pray for is, i guess
