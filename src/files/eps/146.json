@kevinrose on twitter, serial entrepreneur, and all-around wild and crazy guywe're going to get started right now.   ladies and gents, welcome to another episode of \"the random show,\" aka also variant \"the tim ferriss show.\" i am tim ferriss.  kevin rose: i'm kevin rose.  tim ferriss: welcome to internet audio.  kevin rose: it is good to be here. dude, we're doing another random show. it's been a long time.  tim ferriss: it's been a long timewe got to do a bit of banya, russian bath, before venturing back to casa rose.  kevin rose: yes. the russian bath was awesome. we did a little bit of relaxation. we spent probably an hour and a half in there.  tim ferriss: we spent an hour and a half going back and forth between hot and cold.  kevin rose: that's right. cheers, by the way.  tim ferriss: cheers. got a little wine here. it's so weird not having a camera on us.  kevin rose: it is, but now we can unabashedly gaze into each other's eyes with uncomfortable eye contact. tim ferriss: we could both sit here naked if we wanted to. it doesn't really matter.  kevin rose: maybe we are.  tim ferriss: so it's been a little while.  kevin rose: yes.  tim ferriss: i haven't seen you guys in ages. i haven't had a chance to fondle and - you'll see where this is going - say hello to toaster in a while. that's the dog, for those people wondering.  kevin rose: yeah. i have a mini labradoodle. he's 5 years old, 23 pounds. he's an awesome little dudeevery time tim comes over, toaster gets really excited, but he also gets manhandled a little bit because that's how you treat dogs, which is fine.  tim ferriss: fifty shades of labradoodle.  kevin rose: that's right.  tim ferriss: i don't think he's into it.  kevin rose: that's right.  tim ferriss: toaster, what a cutie. we haven't really caught up in a while.   obviously we're hanging at the banya, and bullshitting, and catching up on certain facets, but i don't know what types of things you're really into these days.  kevin rose: yeah. let's start with the sauna use. you were really the one that kind of got me into this in that we started talking about using the sauna. you mentioned it in a handful of your podcasts and whatnot. you had dr. rhonda patrick on your show talking about cold therapy. then wim hof you had on your show. after that, i was like, \"you know what? i'm going to get into this wim hof method.\"   i signed up for the 10-week course, and i just now as of last week completed all 10 weeks. my final week number 10 exercise was to go as long as you possibly can in the cold. for me, it was an ice bath, so i went out and bought 10 bags of ice at the corner store. i hauled them up my stairs.   i dumped them into already cold water coming in out of the tap into my bathtub. this is in the middle of winter in new york. i climbed into the tub and did 15 minutes in the ice bath submerged up to my neck, which was [inaudible].  tim ferriss: awesome.  kevin rose: i've come a long way since week 1. for people that don't know - i'm sure a lot of people listened to the wim hof episode, but it's great. wim holds several world records.  tim ferriss: twenty-plus world records.  kevin rose: yeah. it's something like that as far as exposure to the cold and timed swimming under ice.  tim ferriss: he ran a full marathon in the namib desert without any water at an ungodly 130 degrees or whatever it was. now, i should say i feel obligated to mention this is not the type of thing you want to diy in terms of instruction. the exposure to cold, certainly when immersed in water, these various breathing exercises can be very dangerous, if not fatal.   one of my friends recently had a shallow-water blackout because he was practicing in water and remained submerged unconscious for three minutes.  kevin rose: that's really scary.  tim ferriss: that is how you die or end up with permanent brain damage, so never practice this type of breath hold work in water or near water, and get qualified supervision. do not do this solo ever.  kevin rose: yeah. the 10-week course is a combination, as you said, of breath work and cold exposure. i always kept the two extremely separatei didn't even do them near each other because of just that. i had heard some stories and rumors. wim mentions it as well to keep those more or less separate.   you start off with a really simple week 1 of just taking a standard hot shower and then ending with 30 seconds of cold.  tim ferriss: a cold finish.  kevin rose: a cold finish, if you will.  tim ferriss: i don't know what you're thinking about that prompted that laugh.  kevin rose: it's never that friendly. it's never going to be fun. it was hard. it was a challenge at first because your body is just not used to it at all. i will say the weirdest thing though. forget the whole 10 weeks. at about week 3 - and i've always considered myself a pretty positive person, but i noticed about a 20 to 30 percent increase in mood. i was just feeling happier about random stuff, like work, my interactions with other humans, and my relationship with my wife, and little tasks that would just get under my skin in the past just became softened.  tim ferriss: how often were you doing the cold finish?  kevin rose: i was practicing at this point five times a week.  tim ferriss: five times a week?  kevin rose: yes.  tim ferriss: it wasn't extra timein other words, you were doing it when you were taking showers anyway.  kevin rose: that's right, so first thing in the morning for medarya, my wife, was just like, \"who are you?\" i would jump out of the shower, and she'd be lying in bed still asleep.  ] i'd be like fists in the air like a wild man, all pumped up and jazzed. you know some of the science behind thisyou should probably mention what happens when you get hit with the cold.  tim ferriss: i remember i looked at this when writing the 4-hour body way back in the daythere was a chapter called \"ice age,\" with ray cronise, a really fascinating guy everybody should look up. it looked at fat loss and how to use ice or cold exposure to accelerate that.   there are a number of physiological responses, only some of which we understandnoradrenaline or epinephrine release is onethe immunological enhancements that people have observed in, say, wim hof and his students where he's able to be injected with various bacterial toxins that he can mitigate a sort of fever response to through breath work seems to be correlated with that type of adrenal system response.   you also have different hormones like adenapectin, which is associated with greater fat loss, but the fact of the matter is i do believe even at that point in 2009 or so when i was finishing the 4-hour body that there was at least preliminary data from studies to suggest that cold exposure could produce effects comparable to some antidepressantsit is real.  kevin rose: one hundred percent.  tim ferriss: it is really real.  kevin rose: i don't know if you know this, but back in the day when van gogh cut his ear off, they put him in an insane asylum.  tim ferriss: understandable.  kevin rose: do you know what the treatment was? it was ice baths twice a day.  tim ferriss: really?  kevin rose: yeah. that was the treatment for insanity, and apparently it worked on a lot of people. it bought them down to a more real level. i was insane, probably, for doing this, but it's been amazingi completed the 10 weeks. i'm sold. i'm hooked on ice.   i'm a technology investor, and i'm looking to actually fund some additional research in this area so we can get more data. your point on the minimal effective dose that you write about so often, what is that for humans to get a positive response out of this?  tim ferriss: what temperature? what duration?  kevin rose: exactly.  tim ferriss: what type of submersion?  kevin rose: i've seen this, and i 100 percent know that it's real. there's nothing else. i'm not meditating additionally. i haven't changed my dietnothing else has changed. that that with a grain of salt because it's one person, but i've heard this with many peoplethere are really positive effects to be had here.  tim ferriss: i actually am glad that you made the ask of the audience, and i suppose people can ping us on twitter, so we'll give the handles out in a minute. i also have a request for the audience related to cold.   that is if anyone can suggest, build, or even spec out theoretically what a device would look like that is an immersion circulator, like you would use for sous-vide, that cools water quickly so that i wouldn't have to buy the ice.   i don't have an ice machine at home. at one point i was thinking of getting a massive \"mosquito coast\" type ice machine made from hoshizaki, which is what larry hamilton has. the greatest big-wave surfer of all time has a gigantic hoshizaki machine because he uses so much ice for ice baths.  kevin rose: i'm actually in the process of buying one of those machines right now.  tim ferriss: okay. what my question is for people out there - and the physics here might be impossible. we'll see. if there's a device i could drape into the water to -  kevin rose: you want a cold sous-vide for yourself.  tim ferriss: i want a cold sous-vide for myself, effectively. the reason being if i buy ice - and maybe this has happened to you. it's certainly happened to me. i've done hundreds and hundreds of ice baths.   i'll get the ice, and either sit around a little long and it'll melt, or i will put it into the bath, get distracted, and be like, \"all right. i'm going to do the ice bath in 20 minutes,\" and then 40 minutes passi'm like, \"oh, no. it's already 10 degrees warmer.\"  kevin rose: right, or you get into the bathtub and it melts because your body temperature melts it, and then it's not as cold.  tim ferriss: there are a lot of issues with it. if i could use a device to maintain a cold temperature precisely, that would be really appealingmaybe there's some type of lining with coils - that sounds really dangerous as i say it - that you could put into a tub, maybe even an electric blanket. it's obviously not to electrocute you, but a blanket you could sit or lay on that would cool the temperature.  kevin rose: professional athletes take ice baths all the time, so there has to be equipment for this already.  tim ferriss: i'm guessing in that particular case that you're basically sitting inside an ice box in the sense that they're using freon gas or something like that.   it's a la refrigerator style, to cool the casing of the bath. if anybody out there has any ideas for technology that would allow you to have ice baths without ice, i would be very, very interesting. you can let me know, or kevin, if you're interested in conducted cold-related research and have some qualifications.  kevin rose: yes, please.  tim ferriss: it's @tferriss.  kevin rose: and @kevinrose on twitter.  tim ferriss: sweet. that's cold.  kevin rose: yeah. it was fun. it was a great little fun experiment. i'm glad i did it. i'm sticking with it. tonight, what'd we do? it was probably a total of five minutes.  tim ferriss: it's probably five minutes, and that was a really cold plunge.  kevin rose: it was pretty close to freezing.  tim ferriss: in this particular banya, i would say it was high 30s, very, very, very cold, but therefore my favorite since it's the contrast that i find so appealing.   if you're interested in the athletic applications of this type of thing, you can look up contrast therapy. i believe the east germans were very well known for using it, among other things they used, of course. their female swim team sounded like dudes in the locker room, so it wasn't just ice. i digress.   let me throw out two things that we don't necessarily have to spend a ton of time on that i've discovered in the last week that i've really been enjoying. the first is something called yaktrax. i was looking for this, much like i was looking for this ice device, and i eventually found itthis was in montana. i had accidentally brought boots where the exterior was perfect for the environment, but the sole was slick. it was horrible for walking on snow or ice.   these yaktrax, which you can fit in a jacket pocket, have coilsthey're otherwise made of rubber, and you basically hook it onto your heel, drag it up, and hook it onto your toe. you can walk just flawlessly across snow or ice.   it's fantastic. even for use in, say, a city, they're very easy to walk with. if i were in new york city and i didn't want to have to wear huge sorel boots - which i also wore for snowmobiling, which were amazing - i would just use the yaktrax.  kevin rose: i need these. i didn't tell you this, but about three weeks ago in new york, everything was frozen. i got out of an uber. i may or may not have had two to three glasses of wine, and i hit a patch of ice. i just stood on a patch of ice, and i went straight down and hit my chin on the ground.  tim ferriss: oh, my gosh. that's horrible.  kevin rose: darya freaked out. she was just like, \"oh, my gosh. are you okay?\"  tim ferriss: so wait. you did a superman banana peel, like feet behind you and went face first?  kevin rose: face first, chin right on the concrete. i'm lucky i didn't break something. this is awesome, yaktrax. i will definitely buy a pair of these.  tim ferriss: yeah. yaktrax is just such an elegant solution. the way they're designed is really smart.   it's just a clean, simple design.  kevin rose: which one did you get, the xtr, the run, or pro? do you know?  tim ferriss: i ended up getting the walk, and not because the walk is necessarily the only model i would choose. it was the only one available in my size  kevin rose: you're a shoe pioneer. you were the first one to ever tell me about vibrams like 10 years ago.  tim ferriss: the vibram fivefingers? yeah.  kevin rose: do you still wear those or no?  tim ferriss: i don't, and it's not because of the health claims that they made too strongly, some of which were debunked. it's because of two factors. i do wear zero-drop shoes, though.  kevin rose: what are those?tim ferriss: zero drop, meaning the toes and heel are at the same elevationthese gum sole vans that i'm wearing right now are zero dropconverse would be the same.   vivobarefoot, i think terra is the name of the company, also is zero drop. i do wear those. number 1, the vibrams can really cause achilles tendonitis if you're not accustomed to zero-drop shoes. number 2, i just really found them hazardous to my heels and plantar fasciitis, walking on concrete and asphalt. walking barefoot on soil is one thingwalking barefoot on concrete is quite another.  kevin rose: yeah. i mean, i found the day after my feet were just sore. i kind of thought that was a good thing, though. i thought, \"oh, i'm working muscles that i didn't work before.\"  tim ferriss: walking i think is fine. the biggest issue for me was they ended up smelling terrible, even if i used the injinji japanese-style socks.  kevin rose: there are sprays and stuff for that though, right?  tim ferriss: these were horrendous. speaking of not horrendous, the next little one i'll throw out is an app that i downloaded literally yesterday, and it has blown my mind.   it's called bumble. if you've ever tried tinder and you are a male, this is a better version. it's probably a better version for women as wellthe big difference is the following. if you match - and everything else is fairly standard. you set the geographical range and age range.  kevin rose: are you still swiping left and right?  tim ferriss: you're still swiping left and rightthere are a few ui difference, but here's the biggest difference. if you have a match, the woman has to text first, and you disappear in 24 hours if she doesn't text you. there's a time constraint on matches, and the ball is immediately in the court of the woman. why is this good?  kevin rose: yeah.  tim ferriss: this is good because on tinder, match, or any other - ok cupid, it doesn't matter - what happens? any semi-attractive or attractive woman gets hit with thousands of yahoos sending stupid messages.ias a guy, you also have, therefore, less than a snowball's chance in hell unless you find somebody who's only been on the service for like four days because the recipient is just deluged with idiocyyou spend a lot of time sending messages that never get read and never get responded to. this flips that dynamic entirely on its head.  kevin rose: have you gotten a lot of responses?  tim ferriss: granted we're new york city where the density is insane, but i've never seen anything like this.  kevin rose: wow.  tim ferriss: it is absolutely insane.  kevin rose: can i use your profile real quick? can i try it? you wouldn't hand me the phone earlier, by the way, before we started this.  tim ferriss: for those of you who listen to this show, you will agree that kevin has given me no reason to trust him using my phone.  kevin rose: first of all, i will find your future wife right now, live on this show.  tim ferriss: live on this show? all right. well, i'll tell you what. i'll give you a chance here. i'm letting kevin take a hold of my phone.  kevin rose: she appears to be in her late 20s, early 30s.   blonde, dress is medium length. i'm going to say no to that one. do you agree?  tim ferriss: you're swiping right while you say no.  kevin rose: whoops. tim ferriss: that's okay.  kevin rose: right means yes? i've never done this before. i've been married for a while. first of all, you've got to swipe right on that one.  tim ferriss: yeah. okay. now explain for people why should i swipe right on this girl?  kevin rose: she's got nerdy glasses on. she's got a nose ring. she's got really pouty lips and a nice little soft jacket. she's cute too. can you see other photos? how do you do that?  tim ferriss: this i actually like. you don't have to tap and then swipe left or rightyou swipe vertically to see.  kevin rose: she's a little older though. is that too old for you?  tim ferriss: no. she looks cute  kevin rose: swipe right.  tim ferriss: i'm not judgmental. swipe right. also, big brown eyes, little brown ankles, which i'm fond of.  kevin rose: she's throwing up a peace sign. she looks a little hammered.  tim ferriss: she's cute.  kevin rose: you should swipe right on her for sure.  tim ferriss: all right. there we go.  kevin rose: boom. you got a connection.  tim ferriss: and we matched, just like that.   literally, i installed this app last night.  kevin rose: so the second he matched, two bouncy balls come up, and it shows a b.  tim ferriss: more bumble or start a chat. i've never started a chat before, so let's try it.  kevin rose: no, you're not allowed to. tim ferriss: i'm not allowed to. she has to do it.  kevin rose: it's in her court.  tim ferriss: right. there we go. i exit out. this is so low labor as a maleevery male listening to this who is over the age of 20 has spent thousands of hours vainly attempting to get female attention and wasted a disgustingly high percentage of their liquid.  kevin rose: you just like it because you don't have to do anything.tim ferriss: i like it because it forces the woman to express interest and prequalify in that sense so that the conversation isn't a total waste of time.  kevin rose: what do they say?  tim ferriss: it's lightweight. they're like, \"hey.\"   kevin rose: they're not using pick-up lines on you or anything.  tim ferriss: women don't have to do that, so no. they're not doing that.   i just really like that it's flipping the normal approach entirely on its head.  kevin rose: do you drop, like, \"hey, i have some books out,\" and stuff?  tim ferriss: i don't. i do not.  kevin rose: you have to at some point.  tim ferriss: well, i'll say i'm a writer. i feel conflicted about this because it's weird to be a public-facing person in any capacity and try to dateit's just a weird situation that creates all sorts of -  kevin rose: but it's also awesome.  tim ferriss: it's awesome until it gets really weird, funky, and crazy, if it does.  kevin rose: right, like today at the sauna.  tim ferriss: what?  kevin rose: we were in the locker room getting naked.   tim ferriss: that was weird. it was a little uncomfortable.  kevin rose: two guys are like, \"tim, i love your book.\" we're all naked.  tim ferriss: i'm just in my underwear. i'm like, \"do i take my underwear off now in front of these guys?\" they were perfectly polite, but i'm like, \"i'm not sure what to do in this situation. what's the protocol? do i just let the johnson flop out and go for it?\"  kevin rose: i think you just have to show them the goods. they buy your book.tim ferriss: i'll be like, \"you bought the booknow experience the full.\"  kevin rose: you get the extended chapter.  tim ferriss: oh, god. net net, very positive thing. bumble for people who have been frustrated, male or female, i think it's worth checking out.  kevin rose: that's awesome.  tim ferriss: what about you?  kevin rose: next on my list, a little self-promotion. i launched a newsletter. i wanted to plug that for a second.  tim ferriss: it's a really well-done newsletter.  kevin rose: thank you.  tim ferriss: i've got to be honest. i was expecting more spelling errors.  kevin rose: i spent a lot of time.  tim ferriss: i was really impressed with the newsletter. usually when i get text messages from you, it's like you're typing with your knuckles.  kevin rose: typically i've had a couple of glasses of wine, and it gets a little sloppy. in all seriousness, one of the things i wanted to do is - i love newsletters. i get yours and probably 10 others.   something that i find a little bit frustrating - i don't know if you've run into this, but especially on ones that come out every single day is people don't take the time to probably vet what they're talking aboutyou'll get a lot of product recommendations, and see, \"check out this app. check out this website,\" or whatever it may be. the stuff is just that they're recycling press releases versus actually having spent time with something.   i created a newsletter called the journal. you can check it out at www.thejournal.email. that's actually a domain name. dot-email is a thing nowyou can sign up. basically, what i do is spend one month. i only send one a month. it's not going to overflow your inbox. i fully vet every single thing i talk about. if i talk about a cool piece of electronics, a gadget, a knife, or something i find really interesting, i've spent at least a month or more playing with it, using it, fully vetting it, making sure that it's worth your time.iall of our time is valuable. the last thing i would want is you to click on something that's trash or garbage. it's only once a month, so you only get 12 a yearit's obviously completely free.   i basically put in really cool videos. every single day, i watch a ted talk, and i pick one out of the entire month that i really enjoyed and put it in there.  tim ferriss: what was the last one you put in?  kevin rose: the last one i did was actually a talk by -  tim ferriss: i remember because i actually reached out to him afterwards.  kevin rose: oh, really?  tim ferriss: help me out. this was the zen hospice center.  kevin rose: the guy that runs the zen hospice center.  tim ferriss: in san francisco.  kevin rose: yes.  tim ferriss: amazing guy, and i'm embarrassed to be blanking on his name.  kevin rose: did you watch the talk?  tim ferriss: i did watch itthe reason that it struck such a chord is that he is a friend of a friend of our mutual friend adam gazzaley, the neuroscientist who is on my podcast. kevin rose: i didn't know that.  tim ferriss: i was at princeton shortly after this gentleman we're referring to who gave the ted talk and now runs this hospice center climbed on top of this train and had his one arm and both legs electrocuted off of his body, effectively.  kevin rose: they were like blown off of his body.  tim ferriss: yes. that was a cautionary tale when i went into my freshman year because it had just happened a few years before. that is a great talk. everybody should watch this. i'm so embarrassed i can't remember the guy's name. do you have a sample issue up?kevin rose: if you sign up for the newsletter, you get the last issue automatically. the second you sign up, within two minutes you get the last issue. it's basically about six to eight things in there. i tend to do a couple of videos, a piece of electronics, something you can carry with you, like a cool gadget or something, like a great pen.  tim ferriss: throwing stars.  kevin rose: some ninja throwing stars. the thing for me here is why yet another newsletter?   the only reason is because i am constantly playing with the latest electronics and all different types of things out there. i want to put just the absolute best out.  tim ferriss: you're one of maybe four or five newsletter that i subscribe tothat's it.  kevin rose: awesome. i appreciate that. thank you.  tim ferriss: it would be remiss of me not to mention if you've done a few lines of coke and are really eager to sign up for every newsletter that -  kevin rose: there's one guy out there right now who's like, \"fuck. i'm high as shit. i'm on it.\"  tim ferriss: that is five bullet friday, which is my newsletter. it's sent out a little more frequently, once a week, with the five things that i have found most fascinating or useful. kevin rose: we're like jerking each other's newsletters off right now, but the one that you did, i bought that stupid thing you did with the roller pin that has the knobby knobs on it.  tim ferriss: the rumbleroller.  kevin rose: the rumbleroller, yeah.  tim ferriss: dude, that thing is a game changer. i travel with that.  kevin rose: tell people about that.  tim ferriss: i travel with it.   i have been a foam-rolling skeptic for years partially because i've faithfully done foam rolling with various devices and seen very little return until i got this device called the rumbleroller.  kevin rose: you mean foam rolling as far as rolling out your muscles and stuff like that.  tim ferriss: yes, rolling out my it bands or my adductors.  kevin rose: i'm going to get wine. keep talking.  tim ferriss: i will. i had seen very little roi. there were a few devices that i found very helpful from, say, kelly starrett. for instance, the mobilitywod. there's one called the gemini and a few others that i did find usefulin general, foam rolling i found very difficult and not worth the time invested until i found this thing called the rumbleroller, which has knobs.   if you can imagine a motocross bike tire turned into a foam roller that has a very hard consistency, this is that device. i travel with the 12-inch or 18-inch version of thatit literally travels with me everywhere.   that is the squeaking of another bottle of wine opening, so i will continue with my next recommendation. that was a fully studio version of opening wine. that was incredible. nice. kevin cut his poor little finger open. too bad we're not doing anymore glucomen or ketone testing. save you the troubles and just cut off the tip of your finger.   i am doing something a little weird. wait. first, last bit of call in the next 10 minutes, and you'll get this for freefive bullet friday, if you haven't received it, it has a more than 60 percent open rateif you're involved in email, that's bonkers.  kevin rose: dude, that's actually right where i'm at right now with mine as well.  tim ferriss: nicei think it's because vetted recommendations just do the jobit's incrediblefive bullet friday, if you go to www.fourhourworkweek/friday, it'll pop right up. you can check that out. it's free. it always will be.   next on the list, i will bring up a book that i've been enjoying as a devout non-fiction purist for a long time, i am enjoying delving yet again back into fiction. this book that i'm going to recommend is short and easy to read, and it is hilarious, as is toaster who is waggling his head with metal attached to itthe baron in the trees. i think the guy's name is italo calvino or something.   the baron in the trees was recommended to me by my brother, and my brother and my mother are both very, not high-brow, but they have high standards for books. they never recommend anything unless they love it, and they don't love more than one out of every 20 books they pick upthere've been two books in the last maybe 10 years that have been strongly, strongly recommended to me by my brother and mother, in one case, which is motherless brooklyn.   that is great, hilarious book about a detective with tourette's syndrome in brooklyn - and then the baron in the trees.   the baron in the trees is an older book about a young baron who gets in a huge dispute with his father over dinner, runs outside, climbs up a tree, and stays in the trees for the rest of his life. he has love affairs, learns how to hunt, learns how to build things, work on architectural problems, and it's a fun book to read.   what is most convenient about it as a fiction book is that unlike something like game of thrones, for instance, the golden compass, or even dune, something with really intense world building and a lot of characters, you get to meet the primary characters in the baron in the trees within the first 20 pages, and you can stop for a week or two and pick up right where you left off without having to reread the previous three or four chapters. kevin rose: is this on audio as well?  tim ferriss: i don't know if it's on audio. honestly, there's part of - because i do have the audio book club with audible.   that's www.audible.com/timsbooks - is i want to just make all of these things into audio. it frustrates me that they're not available, but it's a lot of work to turn these things into audio. i don't knowif it isn't, it should be turned into audio, and i'll leave someone in the audience. i will pass the baton to you, and you can reach out to acquire rights to produce audio, but it's a great book, the baron in the trees.  kevin rose: awesome. next up for me, i want to talk about the fitbit blazethis is the new device from fitbit that came out just a few weeks ago, actually two weeks ago. i picked it up. i've been a fitbit user for a long time. tim, i don't think we've ever talked about how you track your heart rate or anything else.  tim ferriss: we have not.  kevin rose: do you track it at all?  tim ferriss: i don't right now. i have a device that i am blanking on the name of, which is a heart rate variability focused heart rate monitor.   i'm going to be literally shaving half of the hair off of my chest to put this, not implant, but effectively paste this onto my chest for seven days straight. it'll be 24/7 heart rate data gathered from the chest that i will then ship off for analysis.  kevin rose: that's clinical grade heart rate monitoring.  tim ferriss: that's right, but in terms of -  kevin rose: i was going to say if you want sleep data, you don't have to shave your chest to get it.  tim ferriss: no, you don't have to do that, but i'm a whacko that way. i'm doing it as part of something called the health nucleus through a company called human longevity inc., which i've invested in. it was cofounded by greg venter who sequenced the first human genome.  kevin rose: oh, i've heard about this.  tim ferriss: and peter diamandis, chairman of the x prize and bob hariri who is a stem cell expert.  kevin rose: is adam involved in this at all?  tim ferriss: i don't know if adam is involved.  kevin rose: okay. he mentioned this, one of our scientist friends.  tim ferriss: they have massive data-crunching capabilities.   part of the testing included full body mris, full genome sequencing, et cetera. the take-home homework in this case was to shave your chest and paste this on, which i have yet to do. shaving my chest - i'm like a silverback gorillait's a lot of work to contend with, so i've put it offi'll be starting that in the next day or two.  kevin rose: back to the fitbit stuff - good luck with the shaving - i've been a fitbit user since day 1. i've tried all these different ones, whether it's the fitbit one or the jawbone. i even tried the microsoft one briefly, and then also the withings.  tim ferriss: the costco version.  kevin rose: the costco version. whatever it is, i'll try it. i really like the one from misfit. misfit was great.  tim ferriss: yeah, misfit was great.  kevin rose: they had a long battery life. it was really lightweight, but it would pop out all the time, and i would lose it.   long story short, for me, i always try to hit 3,000 calories a day or 10,000 steps per day.  tim ferriss: i thought you were going to say 10,000 calories per day. i was like, \"i guarantee the watch isn't going to help you.\"  kevin rose: one or the other. i've always wanted something that does heart rate, so they came out with the fitbit hr here probably i'd say a year and a half or two years ago. i used that for a while, but this just came out, and it has a full display, almost like an apple watch does.   the thing i like about it is that you can go into situations, whether it be running on the treadmill, lifting weights, or sauna use, and you can track your heart rate and time things as well.   today, you saw me doing itwhen we went to the sauna, i go in there and say, \"i'm going to go in the sauna. i'm going to try to hit 10 minutes in the heat.\" one of two things: either i hit 10 minutes and i leave and take a break, or my heart rate will hit 130 to 140.   if it hits that, then i also take a break because i know it's just too much for me.   the one thing i did is i went and did a bunch of research on all these different trackers and tried to find the one with the highest temperature rating because i want it to withstand the heat. i've taken my iphone, for example, into a sauna, which was probably stupid, but i wanted to listen to a podcasti put it on the ground so it would be at the lowest possible temperature in the sauna, and after about 10 minutes, it puts a warning screen up saying \"overheating,\" and then i had to kick it outside the door so that i wouldn't lose my iphone and it wouldn't melt.   this device, i can go in the hottest possible saunas, and it works greatit looks like an apple watch. it's a little bit uglier. just real talk, it's ugly  tim ferriss: it's not that bad. you're a watch snob. i'm sorry. you have high standards for watches.  kevin rose: yeahtypically, i wear a mechanical watch on my 9 to 5 at hodinkee.   but this for me does what i want it to do in that for me, i want heart rate tracking. i want sleep tracking. i want long battery life. it has a five-day battery, which is awesome, and then i can recharge it when i'm at work.  tim ferriss: what is the name of this model?  kevin rose: fitbit blaze. it's $199.00. like i said before, when i'm doing stuff in the sauna, it's essential because i can track just the timewhen i leave the sauna or get off the treadmill, if i'm doing interval training, weights, or whatever, i can hit pause so i can track the total amount of timeit syncs back to the app. i get charts and graphs back on the app. i know that you and i both have a lot of fans that tend to love all things health and fitness. i would say out of all the health and fitness bands out there, this is probably the best one.  tim ferriss: it was cool to observe your heart rate change as we went from one temperature to another.   or even in the case of when we were sitting in the hottest gulag torture chamber version of a sauna when we were on the top step with the stone-mason - i don't even know what you would call it - oven across the room from usit literally felt like my ears were being crisped like pork rinds.   when you poured the water over yourself, we could watch your temperature drop, just plummet - or your heart rate. excuse me. it plummeted on your watch. it was really cool to watch how it oscillated and moved.  kevin rose: yeah. when you go into exercise mode, it keeps the heart rate kind of front and center on the device, so you can just flick your wrist up and see instantly what your heart rate is. when you're sitting there in this extreme heat, the water that they pump into the actual place into buckets is freezing cold.  tim ferriss: it's super freezing cold.  kevin rose: i just dumped it over my head, and i'm sitting there at 130 beats a minute.   and you see it drop down to 125, 120, 115, 110. it plummets, and it's fun to watch. also when we did the freezing ice bath, the same thing. i was hovering around 100 before i went in and then down to mid-70s once i'm in the ice water.   i don't know. for people who are geeks like myself or you, i told you when we were leaving. i said, \"you should buy one of these.\" they're great to have when you're working out. you don't have to wear it all the time. the sleep data is great too, so i use it for that. i can definitely see if i had too many cups of coffee the night beforei look at my sleep data, and it's spiky.  tim ferriss: what is it displaying, your movement?  kevin rose: it displays movement. exactly. you can see when you've had a big disturbance, like say you just get up to use the restroom or something.  tim ferriss: big disturbance in the force, dropping a deuce after too much fiber.  kevin rose: exactly. i don't think that happens in the middle of the night. who does that in the middle of the night? do you do that?  tim ferriss: i thought you were volunteering yourself.  kevin rose: no. i'm just saying sometimes you've got to get up and go pee real quick.  tim ferriss: yeah, of course. i do that.  kevin rose: moreover, it tracks your little micro movements. why are you laughing at me?  tim ferriss: big disturbance. you've been feeding me wine. i haven't had any booze for four weeks.  kevin rose: are you serious? four weeks?tim ferriss: yeah. i am serious. actually, that's complete horseshit because i just came back from having a lot of booze with a bunch of people.  kevin rose: it's been 30 minutes.  tim ferriss: i was having more lysine at the time, which affects ethanol metabolism in a very interesting way, which is also in my five bullet friday, wink, wink.  kevin rose: do you have any of that on you right now?  tim ferriss: i do not. i have it back at the hotel. in any case, i'm sorry to interrupt.  kevin rose: i don't have anything else to say. i thought it was a great device. i don't have any vested interest here. if you like it, buy it. it's uglyit's $199  tim ferriss: that should be the tagline. it's ugly and incredibly useful. kevin rose: exactly. i was really bummed out. i wanted it to look cooler, but it just doesn't, but i love fitbit in general.  tim ferriss: i have a couple of random recommendations for folks.   i recently spent time in yellowstone national park, and it was the first time i'd really spent a lot of time thereit spans across three states. the vast majority is in montana, some in wyoming, and then 1 or 2 percent in idaho. i just had the most unbelievable connected and beautiful tour of yellowstone via cutting-edge snowmobile, which was very quiet.  kevin rose: is it electric?  tim ferriss: it's not electric but very, very quiet. the only way that you can take tours through yellowstone is to be with a guide who is certified. i wanted to recommend, if you end up in montana - i know this is a small percentage of you listening - if you haven't been to montana, you should go anyway, up in bozeman. then you can take a tour with two top snowmobile rental.   i recommend the full-day tour. if you can, do it with a smaller group. michelle was my guide, and she was amazing. she knew everything you could possibly want to know about geology, anthropology, animal movement. we saw bison, a coyote hunt, red fox, and bald eagles.kevin rose: you hunted coyotes.  tim ferriss: no. that sounds weird. we saw a coyote successfully pounce on the snow and push its paws through the permafrost.  kevin rose: did you see that coyote video i sent you where it got its head stuck?  tim ferriss: i did. no, its head didn't get stuck. it was literally pushing its head, in the video you sent me, through the snow to get to a weevil or some type of rodent.  kevin rose: it was funny though, right?  tim ferriss: it was funny. the coyote does the same thing, but because it has a higher body weight, it can use its paws to pounce. boom. it caught what they call a pocket gopher. then it wagged its tail like a happy dog and pulled this thing out. it was sitting in its mouth. it was incredible to watch   the point being, i also went - speaking of cold - for a dip in the firehole river where there's snow and ice. i passed by a couple of bison and then went skinny-dipping in this river for like five minutes. it had to be, i'm guessing, high 30s at best.   two top snowmobile rental, michelle is fantastic. if you want to see her photographs taken in yellowstone, you can see her on instagram. i think it's @mtnmichelle. she was just fantastic. i can't say enough about her.   i have two more thingsdo you have anything else?  kevin rose: i have one book, which is from a friend of ours.  tim ferriss: okay. let me throw one out there then, which is related in terms of books. going not into the future as a technologist but going very retro, and that is i am beginning once again to - after many decades of not doing this - subscribing to print magazines.  kevin rose: so am i.  tim ferriss: really?  kevin rose: yes. i just picked this up. have you heard of this magazine? hold on. i'm walking over. have you heard of this?tim ferriss: monocle? yeah. i have.  kevin rose: it's great.  tim ferriss: it is a very good magazine. i am subscribing to nat geo, so national geographic, and scientific american. the reason being, when you read long-form material on a computer, you are at the mercy of a distraction economy with push notifications.  kevin rose: i 100 percent agree.  tim ferriss: there are social pushes.  kevin rose: it's so weird we're both getting into this right now.  tim ferriss: do you know what i mean?  kevin rose: when i lay down at night, darya will tell you i have monocle next to me, a magazine or something, or a bookthat's my new thingthat's my new jam. it's too easy to get distracted by tab browsing when you're in the browser.  tim ferriss: it's nearly impossible not to.  kevin rose: email comes in.  tim ferriss: you have literally billions of dollars going into studying how to prevent you from focusing.  kevin rose: right.   tim ferriss: what's your budget? it's certainly not billions of dollars, if you're any normal person.   holy shit, dude. that's a heavy pour. wow. that's a lot of wine. i think kevin is about to roofie me. everybody, you are my witness.   it's so relaxing and luxurious in a time when you're bombarded by more information every day than you could possibly consume in a lifetime to sit down and single task with a page that has no notifications. it's so relaxing.  kevin rose: especially when you know that the people behind whatever you're picking up have spent - it just goes to our point of doing these once-every-so-often newsletters. we spend a lot of time really thinking about what would people really appreciate? what is high quality? that's the same when it goes to print.  tim ferriss: doing the heavy lifting. what blew me away - i'd never really read scientific american until a few weeks ago.   and i'll be honest. most pop science magazines i find not pandering. they're dumbed down to an extent that the science is compromised.  kevin rose: it's like mcnews, like usa today.  tim ferriss: that's rightscientific american on the other hand, i picked this up, and i read the reader responses. these are letters that come in, in response to previous article. the level of scientific literacy was so impressive to me that i read the rest of the magazine.  kevin rose: do you ever read nature?  tim ferriss: i have read nature.  kevin rose: it's impossible to read.  tim ferriss: it's dense. it's very dense. you need to be a scientist, really, to interpret that. i found scientific american to be a good stretch publication for me because it provides enough context that i can find a foothold to understand a majority of the conversation, but it also pushes me because it involves a lot of good scientists and science writers.   specifically, i was reading in this last issue about crispr, which is a gene-editing tool and approach which allows precision and speed and cost-efficiencies previously impossible. you can literally use this. feel free to veto me, darya, if i say anything really stupid here. i think it's a messenger rna that basically lines up with specific base pairs of dna if you're looking for a specific gene, and you can knock it out, or you can knock something in.  kevin rose: of your own genes?  tim ferriss: well, you could do it to yourself. that has a lot of risks.  kevin rose: that is really dangerous.  tim ferriss: you could do it for your kids, also dangerous or ethically challenging.  kevin rose: or your friend.  tim ferriss: right now, they're experimenting with it as it relates to agriculture, for instance, to make mushrooms that don't brown and get all slimy and gross, or that last at least a few weeks longer.   kevin rose: this kind of stuff scares me.  tim ferriss: i think that people have well-founded fears based on incorrect assumptions. for instance, if you look at genetically modified foods, people are like, \"gmo, bad. oh, my gosh. we're all going to die. scary, scary stuff.\" usually what they're afraid of, if you drill down to it, is transgenic gene modification. in other words, they're taking fish genes and putting it into wheat or doing something really weird, and even i would say unnatural.   in this particular case using crispr - and of course, particularly since it will get to a point or is at a point where you can gene edit for a few hundred dollars. it is super inexpensive. i'm sure there will be big messes that are created. however, the natural process of, say, plant hybridization, which is gene editing, is not a completely benign process. it's actually a really brute force inaccurate process.   there is a podcast which, in full disclosure, i have not yet listened to. it was tweeted out by bill gurley, one of the - i think - smartest vcs, venture capitalists, out there.  kevin rose: brilliant.  tim ferriss: \"the best podcast you will ever listen to\" was his tweet. it is a podcast about crispr by radiolab. i wanted to throw that out there as well.  kevin rose: cool. one thing on my side of the print equation: monocle. definitely pick an issue upyou're going to have to go to a kind of barnes & noble or one of those funky little -  tim ferriss: cigar shop?  kevin rose: yeah. it's like a cigar shop combo magazine combo newspapersyou know the shop i'm talking about.tim ferriss: like a chinese variety store with the luggage and the little diver who's swimming around in a bucket plus lottery tickets?  kevin rose: yeah. more or less. but monocle is greatthis is the little subtext underneath monocle.   it says \"a briefing on global affairs, business, culture, and design.\" they come out with a new issue every month. it's just a fun readanyway, pick it uplet me know if you like itthat is my take on the print side.  tim ferriss: what are these fancy shoes that you're wearing?  kevin rose: these are nike shoes. they're those really thin-soled 3.0s they're called. they're nike training shoes.  tim ferriss: very colorful.  kevin rose: yeah. actually, the ones i like even better, i linked in my last issue of the journal.  tim ferriss: wink.  kevin rose: no. i didn't do any affiliate codes like you do.  tim ferriss: oh, now we're real. i offer non-affiliate codes. don't cast stones in your glass house.  kevin rose: that's right.  tim ferriss: so what -  kevin rose: last book.  tim ferriss: no. hold on. what were the shoes?  kevin rose: oh, they were just some nikes. they were a combination. they were a running shoe, but they have enough width on them. i haven't showed them to youthey're not downstairs. i'll have to show them to you in minute. they have enough width on them that you can actually lift weights and squat with them as well.   so it's almost like a crossfit style shoe. they're amazing. if you'd read my entire newsletter, you'd know that.tim ferriss: crossfit style shoe, does it say, \"do you even lift, bro?\" on the side?  kevin rose: i don't do crossfit. i am not a crossfit fan.  tim ferriss: clearly. more alexander technique.  kevin rose: are you kidding me? i still have bigger arms than you do.  tim ferriss: you and your guns. i know. you're like one of those genetically modified chickens with huge breasts. i don't know how your feet keep you up.  kevin rose: dude, why are you hating?  tim ferriss: because you're feeding me alcohol. i'm getting all insecure and passive-aggressive.  kevin rose: you didn't do \u00f4roids. it's probably the \u00f4roids that you do.  tim ferriss: it's true. i have been growing horns, mostly growth hormone.  kevin rose: this is when the podcast totally went downhill, the last two minutes.  tim ferriss: alpine goat growth hormone. i don't recommend that, folks. i'm not a doctor. i don't play one on the internet.  kevin rose: all right. let's talk about our friend's book, brodo.  tim ferriss: absolutelythis is the final thing.  kevin rose: our friend marco, that you actually introduced me to, runs a restraint out here in new york city called hearth. it's phenomenal farm-to-table food. it's one of my favorite restaurants.  tim ferriss: if you fly solo or it's just two of you, sit at the pass if you can, meaning where you can watch all the food coming out.  kevin rose: it's an awesome place. i think you'd agree. he also has a little window off to the side of the restaurant that is a walk-up windowsit's almost like a coffee walk-up little station facing the street. you walk up there, and he makes brodo. brodo obviously means bone broth. it's italian for broth. he makes these phenomenal combinations of turkey, chicken, and beef broths along with onions and herbs and turmeric.   he serves it in a coffee cup, so you get a to-go afternoon treat that is just sipping broth. it is awesome.   it's ketogenic-friendly. it's grass-fed bones. he has combinationsone that you haven't heard of that i just tried - i know this because i live here and you don't - which i'm really stoked because when we lived in san francisco, we couldn't find this stuff. he does a broth now with chocolate, pure dark chocolate, in coconut milk, which is a really funky combination.  tim ferriss: wild. is it all coagulated, unmixed, and nasty, or is it blended up?  kevin rose: no, no. it's good. the one that i tried last week which was amazing was this chicken broth with a chicken egg yolk in there.  tim ferriss: that sounds amazing.  kevin rose: it was blended up with a couple other spices, which was just phenomenal.  tim ferriss: what is your favorite broth so far?  kevin rose: the hearth broth.  tim ferriss: is it chicken or beef? what is your preference?  kevin rose: the hearth broth is the blend of all their broths, so it was like a hybrid.  tim ferriss: oh, the animal bone medley.  kevin rose: yes, exactly. i add the chili. he does this really - babe, do you remember what chili he has in the broth? it's a really spice chili that he adds to the broth. maybe it's sichuan chili.  tim ferriss: sichuan cat chili.  kevin rose: with bone marrow. that's my go-to.  tim ferriss: that sounds amazing.  kevin rose: long story short, you can only get this in new york. i was really bummed when i lived in san francisco because i couldn't find it anywhere else. to make this stuff, you need a good recipe. it's easy to do, and it's really cheap to do because you can buy bones for dirt cheap from your butcher. the book is called brodo. it's on amazon. go buy it.  tim ferriss: marco canora. for those of you who read the 4-hour chef, he popped up a lot. he was super helpful.  kevin rose: his book has all of his recipes in it. it's awesome. he also does a bone broth fast in there, which is interesting. it's really cool stuff.   and you will be blown away by the flavor of these broths, and it's really healthy for you too.   do you know why bone broth is so healthy for you? can you speak to that?  tim ferriss: oh, boy.  kevin rose: you get a lot of the nutrients out of the actual marrow, right?  tim ferriss: this is probably a better question for our resident scientist in the room, darya.  kevin rose: do you want to talk about it, babe, for a sec? i'll hand you a mic.  tim ferriss: if you want to get into the whole bone broth conversation, what do you think, darya? nourishing traditions by sally fallon? is that okay?  darya: yeah.  tim ferriss: yeah. i would say nourishing traditions by sally fallon, which talks a lot about the observations of dr. weston price, also very controversial. i think nourishing traditions is a very good basic primer on bone broth and whatnot. if you're going to buy half a dozen cookbooks, i think nourishing traditions is one of the six.  kevin rose: what did weston price have to say about it in his book?  tim ferriss: i will default to ms. fallon in nourishing traditions.  kevin rose: i was curious. i love his other stuff on cod liver oil and things like that.  tim ferriss: i will say - speaking of cod liver oil - that after my podcast with dominic d'agostino, the scientist who has created some incredible exogenous -!kevin rose: dr. dom?  tim ferriss: exactly.  kevin rose: i love him. he's awesome.  tim ferriss: he's amazing. he's so, so good.  kevin rose: he's got a great podcast, by the way.  tim ferriss: really?  kevin rose: he's got his own podcast, but he only put out one episode so far.  tim ferriss: he's so good. he's so, so good. dom is not only an incredible scientist who has created synthetic ketones for navy seals and whatnot, funded by the dod, and is a published researcher, but he is also a beast of an athlete. the guy -  kevin rose: is jacked.  tim ferriss: he's so incredible. i mean, he did i think it was a six-day fast, and then did 500 pounds for 10 reps in the deadlift just to prove that forced production could be maintained after that type of fast   the reason i bring him up is that i asked him what his breakfast looked like.   he said, \"well, i have a can of sardines.\" i was like, \"which sardines?\" \"then i have some oysters from a can.\" \"what kind of oysters?\" i adopted his breakfast, and the sardines - this is a really weird thing. i don't know if anybody here will have any theories as to why this is the case, but i started eating the sardines from, i want to say, wild planet.  kevin rose: yeah.  tim ferriss: i noticed that that two things started to happen. my teeth appeared whiter, and they started to re-mineralize. they appeared to re-mineralize, which makes some sense because you're consuming the bones of the fish. in any case, that's become my go-to. when i travel, i literally travel with boxes of sardines if i'm going on extended trips.  kevin rose: do you want to hear something crazy? this is the honest-to-god truth. your podcast came out. two days later, i went to whole foods, and i was like, \"yeah. i'll do some of that. i'll get some sardines,\" because you mentioned the brands and you said they were at whole foods. sold out.   you know that's never going to be the case with sardines. it's like the hot seller.  tim ferriss: funny you bring this up. i've heard the same thing from people in austin. i've heard the same thing from people in multiple cities.  kevin rose: that's crazy. dude, you are like a sardine -  tim ferriss: sardine oprah?  kevin rose: yeah. you are the sardine oprah, dude. you should get that t-shirt. tim ferriss: sardine oprah.  tim ferriss: i'm sure oprah would love thatshe'd be like, \"well, no. i'm not going to do your podcast.\"  kevin rose: that's amazing.  tim ferriss: what else do we have?  kevin rose: that's it.  tim ferriss: so you have some sardines hereyou've got a different brand.  kevin rose: that's because all the others were sold out.  tim ferriss: bela, portuguese sardines. this is fun. we should have more wine.  kevin rose: it's dinnertime. let's do it.  tim ferriss: any closing thoughts?  kevin rose: just thanks for listening. check out www.thejournal.email on the internet, and please sign up. i guarantee you i will put a lot of time and effort into putting together the best stuff for you guys to enjoy, so thank you.   oh, my wife's podcast.  tim ferriss: oh, yeah. for sure. shoot.kevin rose: yeah. we've got to plug my wife's podcast. my wife, darya rose, is a ph.d. in neuroscience. she has an awesome podcast.  tim ferriss: super baller scientist.  kevin rose: super baller scientist. \"the foodist\" podcast. you can go into itunes and search \"foodist\" and darya rose. it will come upshe's interviewing a lot of really awesome guests, and she talks to people about how they've made changes to their habits and their lifestyle for the better, to lose weight, to be healthier. there's a lot of great information on there on how you can come up with healthy habits and make great life changes for yourself.  tim ferriss: support dar-dar. check it out. as always, folks, the show notes links to various things that we have mentionedit will be available in the show notes at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.   if you would like to get my random musings and craziness, my favorite five things that i find each week, just go to www.fourhourworkweek.com/friday, and knock yourselves outthat is it for now.

with", "if i were in new york city and i didn't want to have to wear huge sorel boots - which i also wore for snowmobiling, which were amazing - i would just use the yaktrax", "i need these", "i didn't tell you this, but about three weeks ago in new york, everything was frozen", "i got out of an uber", "i may or may not have had two to three glasses of wine, and i hit a patch of ice", "i just stood on a patch of ice, and i went straight down and hit my chin on the ground", "oh, my gosh", "that's horrible", "darya freaked out", "she was just like, \"oh, my gosh", "are you okay?\"  so wait", "you did a superman banana peel, like feet behind you and went face first", "face first, chin right on the concrete", "i'm lucky i didn't break something", "this is awesome, yaktrax", "i will definitely buy a pair of these", "yeah", "yaktrax is just such an elegant solution", "the way they're designed is really smart", "it's just a clean, simple design", "which one did you get, the xtr,

claims that they made too strongly, some of which were debunked", "it's because of two factors", "i do wear zero-drop shoes, though", "what are those?zero drop, meaning the toes and heel are at the same elevationthese gum sole vans that i'm wearing right now are zero dropconverse would be the same", "vivobarefoot, i think terra is the name of the company, also is zero drop", "i do wear those",

concrete and asphalt", "walking barefoot on soil is one thingwalking barefoot on concrete is quite another", "yeah", "i mean, i found the day after my feet were just sore", "i kind of thought that was a good thing, though", "i thought, \"oh, i'm working muscles that i didn't work before.\"  walking i think is fine", "the biggest issue for me was they ended up smelling terrible, even if i used the injinji japanese-style socks", "there are sprays and stuff for that though, right", "these were horrendous", "speaking of not horrendous, the next little one i'll throw out is an app that i downloaded literally yesterday, and it has blown my mind", "it's called bumble", "if you've ever tried tinder and you are a male, this is a better version", "it's probably a better version for women as wellthe

has a full display, almost like an apple watch does", "the thing i like about it is that you can go into situations, whether it be running on the treadmill, lifting weights, or sauna use, and you can track your heart rate and time things as well", "today, you saw me doing itwhen we went to the sauna, i go in there and say, \"i'm going to go in the sauna", "i'm going to try to hit 10 minutes in the heat.\" one of two things: either i hit 10 minutes and i leave and take a break, or my heart rate will hit 130 to 140", "if it hits that, then i also take a break because i know it's just too much for me", "the one thing i did is i went and did a bunch of research on all these different trackers and tried to find the one with the highest temperature rating because i want it to withstand the heat", "i've taken my iphone, for example, into a sauna, which was probably stupid, but i wanted to listen to a podcasti put it on the ground so it would be at the lowest possible temperature in the sauna,

have high standards for watches", "yeahtypically, i wear a mechanical watch on my 9 to 5 at hodinkee", "but this for me does what i want it to do in that for me, i want heart rate tracking", "i want sleep tracking", "i want long battery life", "it has a five-day battery, which is awesome, and then i can recharge it when i'm at work", "what is the name of this model", "fitbit blaze", "it's $199.00", "like i said before, when i'm doing stuff in the sauna, it's essential because i can track just the timewhen i leave the sauna or get off the treadmill, if i'm doing interval training,

tend to love all things health and fitness", "i would say out of all the health and fitness bands out there, this is probably the best one", "it was cool to observe your heart rate change as we went from one temperature to another", "or even in the case of when we were sitting in the hottest gulag torture chamber version of a sauna when we were on the top step with the stone-mason - i don't even know what you would call it - oven across the room from usit literally felt like my ears were being crisped like pork rinds", "when you poured the water over yourself, we could watch your temperature drop, just plummet - or your heart rate", "excuse me", "it plummeted on your watch", "it was really cool to watch how it oscillated and moved", "yeah", "when you go into exercise mode, it keeps the heart rate kind of front and center on the device, so you can just flick your wrist up and see instantly what your heart rate is", "when you're sitting there in this extreme heat, the water that they pump into the actual place into buckets is freezing cold", "it's super freezing cold", "i just dumped it over my head, and i'm sitting there at 130 beats a minute", "and you see it drop down to 125, 120, 115, 110", "it plummets, and it's fun to watch", "also when we did the freezing ice bath, the same thing", "i was hovering around 100 before i went in and then down to mid-70s once i'm in the ice water", "i don't know", "for people who are geeks like myself or you, i told you when we were leaving", "i said, \"you should buy one of these.\" they're great to have when you're working out", "you don't have to wear it all the time", "the sleep data is great too, so i use it for that", "i can definitely see if i had too many cups of coffee the night beforei look at my sleep data, and it's spiky", "what is it displaying, your movement", "it displays movement", "exactly", "you can see when you've had a big disturbance, like say you just get up to use the restroom or something", "big disturbance in the force, dropping a deuce after too much fiber", "exactly", "i don't think that happens in the middle of the night", "who does that in the middle of the night", "do you do that", "i thought you were volunteering yourself", "no", "i'm just saying sometimes you've got to get up and go pee real quick", "yeah, of course", "i do that", "moreover, it tracks your little micro

folks", "i recently spent time in yellowstone national park, and it was the first time i'd really spent a lot of time thereit spans across three states", "the vast majority is in montana, some in wyoming, and then 1 or 2 percent in idaho", "i just had the most unbelievable connected and beautiful tour of yellowstone via cutting-edge snowmobile, which was very quiet", "is it electric", "it's not electric but very, very quiet", "the only way that you can take tours through yellowstone is to be with a guide who is certified", "i wanted to recommend, if you end up in montana - i know this is a small percentage of you listening - if you haven't been to montana, you should go anyway, up in bozeman", "then you can take a tour with two top snowmobile rental", "i recommend the full-day tour",

that coyote video i sent you where it got its head stuck", "i did", "no, its head didn't get stuck", "it was literally pushing its head, in the video you sent me, through the snow to get to a weevil or some type of rodent", "it was funny though, right", "it was funny", "the coyote does the same thing, but because it has a higher body weight, it can use its paws to pounce", "boom", "it caught what they call a pocket gopher", "then it wagged its tail like a happy dog and pulled this thing out", "it was sitting in its mouth", "it was incredible to watch   the point being, i also went - speaking of cold - for a dip in the firehole river where there's snow and ice", "i passed by a couple of bison and then went skinny-dipping in this river for like five minutes", "it had to be, i'm guessing, high 30s at best", "two top snowmobile rental, michelle is fantastic", "if you want to see her photographs taken in yellowstone, you can see her on instagram", "i think it's @mtnmichelle", "she was
