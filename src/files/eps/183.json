"raw_text": "Tim Ferriss: Hello boys and girls, lemurs and squirrels. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferris Show, where it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers, or attempt to do something lofty like that, but to drill into the specifics and that is where this podcast is different. I will ask them all of the nitty gritty details so that you can tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, etc. to apply to your own life. But this episode involves Cal Fussman, and for those of you who know Cal, well, he is a master storyteller so sometimes the best policy is just to let him go. Cal appeared on this podcast. Pretty much no one had heard him interviewed at that point and he\u2019s become quite the internet favorite. Cal, @calfussman, F-U-S-S-M-A-N on Twitter, is a New York Times best-selling author and was the writer at large, or is the writer at large, for Esquire magazine, where he\u2019s best known for being the primary writer of the \u201cWhat I Learned\u201d feature. Austin Chronicle has described Cal\u2019s interviewing skills as peerless, and he\u2019s really transformed oral history into an art form in many ways. He\u2019s interviewed icons who have shaped the last 50 years of world history: Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Bezos, Branson, Jack Welch, De Niro, Clint Eastwood, Al Pacino. It just goes on: Woody Allen, Muhammad Ali, John Wooden, Serena Williams; everybody. On top of that, Cal spent ten straight years \u2013 ages ago \u2013 traveling the world, swimming over 18-foot tiger sharks, rolling around with mountain gorillas in Rwanda and searching for gold in the Amazon. This is the second episode with Cal. It\u2019s completely self-sufficient. You can listen to it without having heard the first one. The first one includes all sorts of stories about him trying to box Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, about Mikhail Gorbachev, etc. In this episode, we talk about Muhammad Ali, what he learned from Muhammad Ali, his entire experience with Muhammad and so much more. I asked many of you via Facebook and Twitter, what should I ask Cal in this round two? And probably 70 percent of you just said: he is my favorite storyteller of all time; please just let him talk for another four hours. So that\u2019s effectively what I did, but it\u2019s not four hours long. So I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. I never get tired of talking to Cal. He\u2019s so good at what he does. He\u2019s such a nice guy and he\u2019s such an incredible storyteller. Here you have it, Cal Fussman, @calfussman on Twitter. Enjoy. Cal, my good friend, welcome back to the show. Cal Fussman: Thanks so much. I\u2019m ready to walk the tightrope with you. Tim Ferriss: Speaking of walking the tightrope, someone who\u2019s not ready to walk any tightropes is my poor pup Molly, who got sedated for X-rays earlier today, who\u2019s been entertaining us and gaining our sympathy by wandering around and staring off into space. She looks as high as a kite. You mentioned to me that she should be listening to\u2026? Cal Fussman: Tom Waits. Tim Ferriss: Tom Waits, a name I did not recognize, I\u2019m embarrassed to say. Cal Fussman: Well, if Molly was to hear Tom Waits sing, \u201cThe piano has been drinking, my necktie\u2019s asleep.\u201d That\u2019s pretty well the way she\u2019s looking right now. Tim Ferriss: Thematically appropriate. I thought we would start, and of course we\u2019ve been chatting over the last two days \u2013 spending time together \u2013 about Muhammad Ali. I just want to pass it over to you because I know it hit you quite tremendously hard, it would seem, and unlike most people listening, you had direct interaction with Muhammad Ali. So I\u2019ll just pass it over to you for your thoughts. Cal Fussman: For me, it was almost like having your childhood end when you\u2019re in your 50s \u2013 on the day that he died. It\u2019s very hard to describe the feeling. I hadn\u2019t ever really felt anything like it. In fact, at a time where everybody was sitting down in front of the television looking for reports, I just curled up in bed. I kind of knew the story. I knew everything, so there was nothing more for me to learn. I was just terrifically saddened because he was my childhood hero and there really are no longer many like him. Tim Ferriss: What made him unique? And how did you grow to or get to know him? Cal Fussman: I didn\u2019t meet him until 2003. At that point, the world knew that he had Parkinson\u2019s disease. We had seen him at the Olympics with the torch. So let me back up to when I was a kid seeing him for the first time. It\u2019s very hard for a lot of people to understand what the \u201860s were like if you didn\u2019t live through them. Because every day, you woke up and something else happened that made you go what? What? What? Whether it was, sadly, the shootings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. or Bobby Kennedy, or it could have been Woodstock, or landing on the moon. Every day seemed to bring something that you didn\u2019t expect. Ali was in the middle of it. That\u2019s when he came of age. He won the heavyweight championship in 1964. So he kind of embodied, for me, the spirit of asking questions. Because at the time, he had won the Olympic gold medal in 1960. The story goes \u2013 we don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s true \u2013 that when he came back to Louisville with his medal, he wasn\u2019t allowed into a restaurant and able to sit with white people. So he took his gold medal and he threw it in the Ohio River. Whether the story is true or not, it makes a point. He was, in my mind, the voice of reason amidst what, at the time, was just crazy behavior. It\u2019s hard to imagine that there were places where black people couldn\u2019t walk into and sit next to white people. I\u2019m walking around now and I\u2019m just seeing in these days of Black Lives Matter, just how integrated we are. You go to an airport and there\u2019s no longer a thought about this. But back then, that was the order of the day. Muhammad Ali was somebody who stood up to that and let people know: hey, this is wrong. And he did it in a way that made people laugh at times, through poetry; he was like the first rapper. You could not take your eyes off him. The other thing that\u2019s kind of interesting about it was there were only three networks that you could really watch in those days. Tim Ferriss: Right, we were talking about that; it was kind of like BBC 1, 2, 3, and 4, in a sense. Cal Fussman: Right. And if you have the camera on him, one of the most charismatic figures in the world, nobody else is going to compete with that. So everybody was watching him. It\u2019s not like now in the days of the internet and TMZ, where he would have been followed relentlessly and every detail of his life would have been on the internet. You only knew so much, but he was everywhere. Probably the most popular or the most well-known person in the world. When the Vietnam War really started to kick in and Ali was inducted into the draft, the way he stood up to it and his famous line, \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing against no Vietcong. It\u2019s just white people sending black people to kill yellow people.\u201d At the time, this sliced the country in half. Either you loved him for it or you hated him for it. Either you were with the kids out on the street who were protesting against the war or with the people who were beating them over the head. Very hard for somebody who\u2019s young now to understand that time? We talk about the conventions that we\u2019re having this year. People should go back and look at the 1968 Democratic Convention. It was a free-for-all. There was all kinds of violence outside of it. And Ali lived amidst this, and he was always, in my mind, asking the right questions. Why are we in Vietnam? Why can\u2019t I sit next to somebody who has white skin in a restaurant? It was very simple. And then, there were so many people who hated him for asking those questions and for changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. He was really reviled by a huge number of people in this country. For him to constantly stand up and risk going to jail for what he believed in, the faith that he had. Then it was backed up by his bravery in the ring when he fought with Joe Frazier and he fought with George Foreman. People thought he was going to get killed when he fought George Foreman, who was undefeated and had knocked out just about everybody. Tim Ferriss: What about the Incredible Hulk? I think it was in the warm-ups leading up to \u2013 am I getting this right? It was in Zaire. I might be getting my locations mixed up. I sometimes conflate the Frazier and Foreman fights. But Ali and others didn\u2019t want to watch Foreman warming up on the heavy bag because it was just such a spectacle of force and impact. Cal Fussman: Yeah, you didn\u2019t want to believe that was coming in at you. And yet, when they got into the ring to fight, Ali basically laid back on the ropes and let Foreman throw that at him, all the while saying, \u201cThat all you got, George? That all you got?\u201d And a funny line by Foreman was after four rounds, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s about it.\u201d And then by the eighth, Ali hit him with a few straight punches and down he went; he was just exhausted. But over again, we saw him take tremendous punishment and come back as he aged. You just had a tremendous sense of belief when you followed him. So for me, the idea that he was always asking these questions that were important to ask, that were the most important issues of the day, and then when he stood up to everything that was in front of him with full faith in himself, in my mind that was the definition of a hero. In 2003, Esquire magazine was celebrating its 70th anniversary. It had always been my dream to do a magazine story about Muhammad Ali, from the time I was a kid. So they sent me out to write this cover story based on reportage in Dublin, Ireland, where Muhammad was in town for the Special Olympics. He was going to help inaugurate the games. So I went out there and it was one series of experiences after another that were completely surprising to me. Because do you know when you have a hero, you often don\u2019t want to meet them because they\u2019re your hero before you know who they really are. Tim Ferriss: Right, and you might encounter the hero with clay feet. Cal Fussman: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And suffer the disillusionment and disappointment. Cal Fussman: Yeah, and you don\u2019t want to walk away from your hero disappointed. So I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. But keep in mind \u2013 we should cite this; this is seven years after 1996, the Atlanta Olympics \u2013 when he did something else that I thought was very brave. Because at that point, everyone knew he had Parkinson\u2019s disease. And he stood with the Olympic torch in front of the world. The torch is in his shaking hand. He had to put it into the Olympic cauldron to get it to light. And for what seemed like an endless amount of time, he couldn\u2019t get it in the right place, and his hand is shaking, and it was like the world was holding its collective breath. And all of a sudden, he got it in the right place. The flame erupted, and so did everybody\u2019s heart. And from that point on, \u201896 to 2003, we hadn\u2019t really seen that much about him. So the editors basically said, \u201cTell us, how is he doing?\u201d So I go to the Special Olympics to meet him. He\u2019s in a hotel, and he knows in advance that he\u2019s my childhood hero. He comes through the double doors of his bedroom suite and he\u2019s walking kind of slowly, and I just put out my hand to shake his hand. And he just threw out his arms and hugged me with a big embrace. After that, he\u2019s moving on really slow, tender steps. And then he kind of slumps down in this cushy leather chair. I take the sofa on the side. And I say to him, \u201cChamp, I came here to find out all the wisdom that you\u2019ve accumulated in the world.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t seem to be paying attention. He seems to be paying attention to his right arm, which is trembling back and forth. And now both of his arms are really starting to tremble. And I\u2019m starting to think, what should I do? Should I call his wife? And now, not only his arms are trembling but his torso, his legs are shaking, his breaths are coming almost in gasps. And now I\u2019m really starting to get nervous. I said, \u201cChamp, Champ, are you okay?\u201d And then slowly, his head rises to the point where he is at eye level with me. And he looks me in the eye and he says, \u201cScared ya, huh?\u201d And it only got more confusing. It only got more confusing. So the Olympics get started, Special Olympics, and there was one moment when it really hit me. Like you asked why was he your hero? Muhammad is going to meet with Nelson Mandela. Muhammad\u2019s best friend and photographer, Howard Bingham, is with us, and Muhammad\u2019s wife, and I\u2019m coming along. We meet Mandela, and we\u2019re walking to a hotel suite to sit down and talk. And on the way, Mandela is saying how when he was imprisoned in his younger days and he would hear news of Muhammad Ali, how much it inspired him. And I\u2019m standing there looking at Nelson Mandela thinking: hold it; my hero is Nelson Mandela\u2019s hero. And that\u2019s when it really hit me what Muhammad Ali meant to the world. We had this nice meeting. And then the Olympics get started, and Ali was there to go around the track in a golf cart and kind of wave to the crowd and just get everything started off on a really high note. So I\u2019m down at the base of the stadium with him, and the golf cart comes out and Muhammad slowly gets on; he gets into his seat. Howard, his best friend and photographer, gets on the back and he waves me \u2013 come on, get on, get on. So I run and I hop on the golf cart and it was an amazing experience. Because you\u2019re driving around, and there\u2019s 80,000 people in Croke Park. And wherever Ali went was that same chant: Ali, Ali! And it was almost like this energy is coming from the top of the stadium down on us. Then Ali would put up his hand, and then the energy would get pushed back all the way to the top. Then it would come down again, and so back and forth and back and forth. I was always the one at the top of the stadium screaming, so it was an amazing experience to see the power that he still had. And yet, when we had to leave that day, he needed a wheelchair. So it was like a mystery to me because he had all this power, and yet he was very vulnerable and his body was breaking down. I was just trying to figure this out to write this story, to explain how is Muhammad Ali doing? It was confounding to me. Because one day we would go out to dinner and after dinner, we\u2019re coming out of the restaurant and a huge throng of people is coming. It\u2019s time to get in the car and go. We just can\u2019t be avalanched like that. He needs to move fast, and he does. And then, the day after that, he can\u2019t speak much above a whisper at that time but he\u2019s doing magic tricks for people. When we got back to his home in Michigan, I remember he had just taken his medicine for Parkinson\u2019s disease. We\u2019re sitting on the couch. The medicine turned his tongue orange. We\u2019re talking and just all of a sudden he falls asleep, and his left leg is jangling into mine. I\u2019m thinking, how can I possibly make sense of this? I can\u2019t really describe these contradictions. There\u2019s no question I can really ask that\u2019s going to unlock this mystery. So I\u2019m getting down to the last day that I\u2019m scheduled to be with him. And Muhammad\u2019s wife, Lonnie, says, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t work out much anymore, Muhammad. Why don\u2019t you just go with Cal to the gym and just do a little workout?\u201d Muhammad kind of rolls his eyes: oh, okay, come on. So he takes me over to the gym on the property, and it\u2019s not really a gym; it\u2019s more like a museum. We walk in and the ring looks like nobody\u2019s ever-stepped foot in it. There\u2019s no smell of sweat. There\u2019s exercise equipment all around the ring and it looks like it\u2019s just out of boxes. All four walls have mirrors on them, and above the mirrors are photos, great photos, of Ali fighting his archrival Joe Frazier. There were other photos, too, but those were the ones that really stood out to me. Because the trilogy that they fought was like the thrill of my childhood. It\u2019s what I lived for. I knew everything about Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier down to the childhood stories that define their styles in the ring. Like for instance, Muhammad, when he was a kid, he would have his younger brother, Rudy, pick up rocks in the street and throw the rocks at Muhammad\u2019s head. Back then, he was Cassius. And as the rock would be approaching his head just about to hit, he would just throw his head back, lean away from it and let the rock slide by. And that was exactly the style he adopted in the ring. He would dance like no other heavyweight ever before him danced. If you got close enough to throw a punch, he was just going to lean back, make you miss, and then he\u2019d hit you like 20 times, faster than a shoeshine guy could buff a pair of shoes. Joe Frazier, on the other hand, very different story. Short, stocky, and here\u2019s where that left hook came from. When he was a kid, he grew up on a farm in Beaufort, South Carolina. His dad had only one arm. Nobody knows the real story, but apparently there had been trouble with some other woman, and some shooting, and so Joe\u2019s dad only had one arm. And they would work this cross saw back and forth, Joe and his dad. Joe\u2019s dad would use his right arm, and Joe would be using his left. So he\u2019s just sawing back and forth for years with that left hand. He had the muscles that are developing as he\u2019s going back and forth, back and forth. The power that he developed in this left hand turned into this phenomenal left hook that came out of the side out of nowhere. It was the only punch that a kid who could move away from rocks in the middle of the street was vulnerable to because you didn\u2019t see it coming. All the times, except at the very end of his career that Muhammad Ali got knocked down, always with a left hook. It was his kryptonite. And here you\u2019ve got a guy who is like 5\u201910\u201d, 205 pounds of relentless kryptonite coming at him. And when Ali fought Frazier, it was like thunder versus lightning. The thing about it was, when they fought, Ali had already refused to go into the Army. He was stripped of his heavyweight championship. The government wouldn\u2019t let him fight. The state commissions wouldn\u2019t let him fight for three and a half years. He lost the prime of his career. When he was finally able to come back in 1970, he wasn\u2019t as fast. He couldn\u2019t dance the way he danced when he was 22 and 23. At this point, he\u2019s 28, 29. He\u2019d never had anybody like Joe Frazier coming at him before. So you had on March 8, 1971, thunder versus lightning, never before seen: two undefeated legitimate heavyweight champions confronting each other. Frank Sinatra, there was a photographer in the front row; everybody had to be ringside for this. The whole world was watching. It was like the sporting event of the century. So what happened, what happened in the first fight anyway is Ali started to get in trouble because Joe Frazier just would not stop. The left hooks kept coming. Ali was able to get into the minds of a lot of his opponents. He tried to get into the mind of Joe Frazier. Frazier would be hitting him with shots and Ali would be saying to him, \u201cYou can\u2019t beat me, I\u2019m God!\u201d That would have worked on some other people. Joe Frazier just looked at him and said, \u201cWell, God\u2019s gonna get his ass whooped tonight!\u201d He kept throwing punches. And so when Ali would get into trouble \u2013 and Frazier got him into trouble \u2013 he had this corner man named Drew Bundini Brown, who was the guy who, when you hear the phrase \u201cFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee,\u201d that came from both Muhammad and Bundini. They would kind of sing it, \u201cFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee; rumble, young man, rumble!\u201d So when Ali got in trouble, Bundini would, in the most poetic ways, say things to help lift him up, anything. \u201cThe world needs you, Champ!\u201d \u201cGo to the well once more! Go to the well once more!\u201d Almost always, Ali would reach inside of him, find whatever was deep in the well, and use it to lift him over the bar. So I\u2019m looking at these pictures above the mirrors on the wall, and I\u2019m almost hearing Bundini\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cGo to the well once more!\u201d And I realized that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to do. That is my question, here. In order to write this piece, I\u2019ve got to find out what\u2019s still in the well. So I look around the gym and there is a rack of boxing gloves. And I\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cYou think you should take the risk?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Then I said, \u201cWhat the hell, let me try it.\u201d Because one of the things that I\u2019ve learned as an interviewer is when you get to the end of an interview, that\u2019s when you can always ask the toughest question. So I take four gloves off this rack and I put two on Muhammad\u2019s hands and two on mine. Now, actually if people heard the first \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Installation of our conversation. Cal Fussman: Yeah. Then they know about the story of me fighting against Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. Tim Ferriss: Which begins \u2013 just as a side note \u2013 with you sitting on the couch eating potato chips berating Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez on TV and your wife saying something along the lines of, \u201cOh, yeah, okay. You\u2019re going to fight Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez?\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cDamn right I\u2019m gonna fight Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d And long story short, because you should listen to the long version, you ended up traveling by hook and crook and donkey and everything else to make it happen. Cal Fussman: Yes, we did. Tim Ferriss: But you did a lot of serious boxing training. Cal Fussman: And that\u2019s the whole point, here. When I trained, I trained for six months to get in the ring for one round with Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. And I trained in the exact style of Joe Frazier. I could do Joe Frazier so well, I could even sound like Joe Frazier. So I\u2019ve got these gloves on, he\u2019s got the gloves on, but I don\u2019t come at him. I don\u2019t ask to go to the ring. I just start to move toward the heavy bag. Smokin\u2019 Joe had this style where he\u2019s like bobbing back and forth, his head moving left to right, and his left hand would be doing like a figure eight in front of his head and his right hand would be figure eighting in front of his jaw. And he\u2019s going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. He\u2019s low, and he\u2019s in a crouch and he\u2019s just relentlessly pursuing. Then he\u2019d get close with the left hand saying, \u201cHit me ta, hit me ta.\u201d He\u2019d be throwing that left hook. So I\u2019m in that crouch, I\u2019m bobbing and weaving. I\u2019m looking at Ali out of the corner of my eyes to see what kind of reaction I\u2019m going to get. It was like watching his eyebrows arch. It was like watching a sleeping lion awakened by an old, familiar scent. He looks over and he says, \u201cYou good!\u201d I hear that and now I\u2019m starting to hit into the bag saying, \u201cHit me ta, hit me ta!\u201d I\u2019m throwing my left hooks right at it: hit me ta, hit me ta. Ali steps up. And he\u2019s throwing left, right, left, right, left right. I said, \u201cYou think that\u2019s gonna keep me off?\u201d Now I\u2019m really in a crouch. Hit me ta, hit me ta, hit me ta. He steps in, lefts and rights, lefts and rights, jab, jab, jab, lefts and rights. I come back, and all of a sudden he looks at me in a way that says: \u201cOkay. So that\u2019s your question.\u201d Slowly, with his left hand, he waves me away from the bag, and he waits until I\u2019m away from the bag. Then I saw something I never thought I would ever see again. Muhammad Ali started dancing. He\u2019s dancing around the bag. He\u2019s moving not like when he was 20, but he still had the rhythm, he still had the grace. He\u2019s moving around the bag, and he\u2019s looking at himself in the mirror. As he\u2019s looking at himself, you could see his chest come up. Then his head came up, and he\u2019s dancing, and he\u2019s dancing. Then all of a sudden, he stops, pivots, and there were like 40 straight shots right into the bag, really rapid fire. I\u2019m in disbelief. His last shot, if the bag had been a heavyweight fighter, he might have knocked him down. I\u2019m standing there just staring, don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s hard to process what I\u2019ve just seen. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re thinking, no one is going to believe me. Cal Fussman: Yeah. What? As he\u2019s going away from the bag, his legs cross and he starts to go down. I\u2019m going: no, no, this is not happening. No, please! And now he\u2019s going down, down, down and there are mats on the ground, and he falls on the mats. Now I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhat did you do, Cal? Oh, you idiot! Why did you do that?\u201d I\u2019m paralyzed for a second but then I start to move over to help him get up. Before I can reach him, he flips over and he starts doing stomach crunches. Then he\u2019s doing sit-ups. Then he\u2019s on his back, legs bicycling in the air. Then he gets up and he goes over to super leg press. It\u2019s on like 250 pounds. He grips it, pushing it back and forth. I said, \u201cChamp, you don\u2019t have to do this. I seen you, Champ. I seen you. Don\u2019t worry about it. I know what\u2019s in the well.\u201d And he just looked at me and he said, \u201cFeels good.\u201d And I thought I had pushed him as far as I could, but he had more to give. So after this, we go back to the house and he knew that I wanted his wisdom. He tells me to sit down at a table outside the kitchen. I\u2019m sitting down, and he comes to me with a piece of paper. On this paper, it\u2019s just filled with wisdom. I\u2019m going down the lines, one after the other, and he points to one in the middle. It says, \u201cGod will not place a burden on a man\u2019s shoulder knowing that he cannot handle it.\u201d And that kind of summed everything up. But for me, the story went a little further. Because he went into the kitchen, and he came out with two bowls in his left hand and a quart of ice cream in his right. You know how much I love ice cream, Tim. So I got a chance to sit at a table and have ice cream with my childhood hero. That is my enduring memory. It was just sad to in one minute know that this man who had been with me all my life was not with us anymore. The thing that really pushed me, because I was called by the editor of Esquire because the magazine was shipping out on the exact day that Muhammad died. So he wanted to hold off the issue and make sure that we represented. Esquire had followed Ali\u2019s career like just about no other magazine; maybe Sports Illustrated can make the same claim. So I\u2019m sitting there charged with writing this essay of what he meant to me. What really hit me was when I started to think forward. I started to think of all of the kids now. I\u2019m wondering, what kind of heroes do they have? Do they have a Muhammad Ali? I don\u2019t think so. The reason I don\u2019t think so is because we don\u2019t have a Nelson Mandela who saw Muhammad Ali as a hero. It\u2019s just a completely different time. I wondered what this absence might mean for this next generation going forward. Who are their heroes? What are they going to get out of it? It really has pushed me to think, and to think a lot about this millennial generation, which we were laughing about yesterday because everybody says the word \u201cmillennial.\u201d Tim Ferriss: I tried to look it up. I was like, we need to sort this out. We were at dinner having some wine. And the first article that pops up says, \u201cEveryone can agree that millennials are the worst.\u201d And the next line was something along the lines of, \u201cBut no one can seem to define what exactly a millennial is.\u201d Cal Fussman: Well, there you go. The amazing thing to me, for some reason \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it is, and I think you have the same characteristic \u2013 certainly you do. I\u2019m just starting to see little vibrations of it. Where there\u2019s an attraction among the millennials to you. I know that because they all come over to me and say, \u201cOh, I heard the podcast that you did with Tim Ferris.\u201d So there\u2019s like this whole arc of millennials out there that I know are listening to you. They\u2019re also starting to come up to me. I really feel for this generation. I feel for them because I don\u2019t think they have a Muhammad Ali. A lot of them were behind Bernie Sanders. To me, I love seeing Bernie out there pounding on the podium. He\u2019s in his mid-70s and he\u2019s throwing himself into it, and it looked like what could be better than that? You\u2019re that age and you\u2019re throwing your entire passion into your every day. You can\u2019t beat that. But to me, there\u2019s a difference between having Muhammad Ali as a hero and to having Bernie Sanders as a hero. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, maybe people will \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Well, I think there\u2019s a difference in stakes, right? And I think that \u2013 who was it? Cus D\u2019Amato? I want to say it was Cus D\u2019Amato, the famous trainer of Mike Tyson starting in the Catskill days, who said, \u201cThe hero and the coward feel the same thing. The difference is how the hero responds.\u201d And I\u2019m paraphrasing, of course. But the fact of the matter is if \u2013 and I\u2019m sure some people will disagree on some level \u2013 but the stakes of engaging in the theater of politics for an election are very different from going up against the norms and laws of your country. The stakes are just different. So you have someone who has put their livelihood where their mouth is, and reputation where their mouth, is to make sacrifices. I think that engenders a certain type of loyalty and respect that is very hard to mimic in the sort of charade of politics as we see a lot of it play out. But I would say that if there is a problem related to heroes among younger generations right now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because there is a lack of heroes. I think it\u2019s because there is so much noise that one needs to sift through to find the signal that is a hero they can believe in. If that makes any sense. Instead of having four channels, you have an infinite number of channels in the form of websites and feeds and apps and push notifications, and so on. So it becomes more of a sort of cognitive burden and time-consuming task to find someone that one can dedicate their admiration to. Does that make any sense? There are a few exceptions, though. I would say that, as you said, we didn\u2019t have all of the details when he was the greatest. Much like all of this sort of came up at the time, for the nature of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 the adultery. People are flawed human beings; they make mistakes. They make bad decisions. But in today\u2019s environment, that gets showcased and put into a permanent record that comes up as a top five Google result for your name. So I think it\u2019s more challenging to have heroes now because they are more clearly human as a result of the abundance of information available. But I do think there are some out there. Elon Musk I think is very inspiring, has made great decisions, has all of the flaws that human beings do, of course. But I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. I think that there are very few Muhammad Alis, period, in the world. Cal Fussman: Well, yeah. What I realized is a lot of this is the time, as you\u2019re saying. Because when you look at what Elon Musk is doing and the grandiosity of his vision, and then also to have failed, failed, and then put the craft in the air. So you see, yeah, this is a big timer. And yet, if you were in South Dakota at a movie theater and Elon Musk was ten people in front of you in line to get in, how many people would know who he was? Tim Ferriss: I see where you\u2019re going. He is sort of unassuming compared to a heavyweight champion of the world, right? Cal Fussman: Yeah, but to my mind when you think of a hero \u2013 this is what I\u2019m trying to grapple with, this question. Has the hero changed now so that Elon Musk is the hero now? But to think of him in the way I think of Ali is just foolish because everything\u2019s changed. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s entirely possible. I want to actually ask a couple of questions that were sitting on my mind during your story. The first is, do you remember the flavor of ice cream that you had? Cal Fussman: Vanilla. Tim Ferriss: Vanilla? Just straight vanilla? Cal Fussman: Straight vanilla. Tim Ferriss: No decoration on the vanilla? Cal Fussman: No, just vanilla ice cream. Tim Ferriss: How did you end up opening and/or closing the piece that you wrote, if you remember? Cal Fussman: It\u2019s interesting because one of the difficulties that you have \u2013 and this always happens. You\u2019re a writer and they say okay, you\u2019ve got 1,500 words. Then you start writing, and then there are 2,500 words on your page and you know that only 1,500 are going to fit in the magazine. They basically pull this thing away from the presses, and there are a certain amount of pages and so there\u2019s no extra room for you. The editor said, \u201cThis is what I can give you.\u201d He\u2019s giving you an opportunity to make the most out of it. Of course you want to make it even better than that, somehow. So you go overboard and you write a thousand extra words. Then you have to look at it, have an editor look at it, and then say okay, what\u2019s the 1,500 words that we really want here? The interesting thing about this piece was exactly what I was just talking about. There was everything that I had seen in the past, and then there were these questions of where does this put the future? But at the time, it really was an obituary and so it really was a look back. So the thousand words that got cut were the thousand words that were looking ahead. And it basically ended with this point that you just were never going to see this again, ever. It\u2019s passed. We don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going. Maybe it is going to the Elon Musks of the world and people will just have a different definition than I did. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s possible. Or if you look at just a broader time scale, right? I mean how many Genghis Khans are running around? Not that many. And if you look at it in a broader, 1,000 year increment, maybe we\u2019re just in a lull period between heroes. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s an interesting point. I guess we\u2019re accustomed to \u2013 we want heroes. Tim Ferriss: We need heroes. I think human beings need heroes. I think we\u2019re hardwired to search for heroes. We find them in real life, we find them in mythology, we find them in religion, or we find them somewhere else. I think we are by nature very hierarchical animals. There\u2019s a very interesting book called Chimpanzee Politics for people who are very interested in looking at the reality of our evolutionary biology. I think we look for rulers and heroes, and it\u2019s an important signpost for the mammals we\u2019ve evolved to be. Do you recall any of the other pieces of wisdom on that paper? Cal Fussman: There were a lot that ran in this \u201cWhat I\u2019ve Learned\u201d that I really like. My favorite was \u201cThe best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.\u201d That was a good one. \u201cSilence is golden when you can\u2019t think of a good answer.\u201d \u201cThe sun is always shining someplace.\u201d I remember asking him about his definition of evil. And he said, \u201cUnfriendliness.\u201d I thought that was a really good answer. \u201cThe more we help others, the more we help ourselves.\u201d \u201cWhat you\u2019re thinking about you are becoming.\u201d Oh, how about this for a kicker? \u201cWhen you\u2019re right, nobody remembers. When you\u2019re wrong, nobody forgets.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Dot, dot, dot; especially with the internet. Cal Fussman: Looking back, I think it captured the experience that I spent with him. So there were two stories. One was the cover story that came out on the 70th anniversary of Esquire in 2003. Then in January of \u201804, the \u201cWhat I\u2019ve Learned\u201d came out. I think both stories captured the essence of what I wanted to bring out. On top of that, I should point out for me, the best part of the experience was spending a week with my childhood hero. And at the end of it liking him even more than I did before I met him. He was even more heroic to me for that reason, once I knew him. Just seeing the kindness. There was this great obit in Time magazine written by a guy named Bob Lipsyte, who was a New York Times columnist for many years and spent 50 years with Ali. They did a book in Time magazine that was filled with Lipsyte\u2019s story and photos. The story starts in an interesting way. He and Ali are going through an airport. They\u2019re late for the plane and Lipsyte doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re going to make it. As they\u2019re moving through the airport, a woman appears and notices Ali and pulls out her camera to get a picture. Ali stops, goes over to the woman, and makes sure that she has the picture that she wants. Lipsyte is thinking, \u201cLook, the plane\u2019s going to leave.\u201d Ali said to him, \u201cThat was the only time that woman was going to have a chance to have her picture taken with me. I wanted to make sure she got the best picture.\u201d I don\u2019t know that there are many people who are thinking that way. Obviously, part of it gave him internal satisfaction, but he really was thinking a lot about everyone around him. Tim Ferriss: Who are other people, heroes or just well-known folks who have exceeded your expectations? Cal Fussman: I have breakfast every morning with Larry King, and so I see him when we\u2019re in town together at the same time probably 300 days a year. If you\u2019re an interviewer, it\u2019s very likely you\u2019re going to really look up to him. I\u2019ve formed a very close friendship with him and that\u2019s something I never could have anticipated. It\u2019s beyond what he accomplished in a career; now it\u2019s about friendship. So it has gone way beyond that sense of a hero from afar. In fact, I helped him write a book and he inscribed it to me saying, \u201cTo Cal, my friend, my writer, my hero.\u201d When your hero calls you \u2013 he was joking, but still he wrote it on the page. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s still on the page. Cal Fussman: It\u2019s still on the page; it still counts. But that\u2019s emblematic that he would write that to me. It tells you about him. It tells you about the kindness and the friendship underneath it. So that\u2019s probably my best answer to the question. Tim Ferriss: I have some requests from fans, or I should say listeners, who had a lot of follow up questions for you and of course we\u2019ll have to pick and choose. But this is from Ozro Hepworth: ask him if he\u2019ll talk about the time in Brazil he used a camera under his shirt as a fake gun to scare off some guys. Is that a real thing? Cal Fussman: How did he know? Tim Ferriss: He said, \u201cI heard the story from someone who knows him pretty well. I would love to hear about it via Cal Fussman storytelling style.\u201d Cal Fussman: Oh, man. Wow. Let\u2019s see. Tim Ferriss: My fans are everywhere, man. Eyes and ears in all corners. Cal Fussman: You know what? That\u2019s pretty impressive. Okay. This is early, I believe, 1994, February carnival, Rio de Janeiro. Tim Ferriss: Carnevale. Cal Fussman: My wife is Brazilian. I met her headed to a beach near the equator eight years before this carnival. Tim Ferriss: The bus story that we talked about in part one. Cal Fussman: Right. And so we get a chance to go back to Carnival where we\u2019re going to dance in the samba parade and spangles and feathers at 3:00 in the morning in front of the huge crowds. It\u2019s like a fantasy. Tim Ferriss: Custom thong for yourself, I\u2019m assuming? Cal Fussman: When you join a samba school \u2013 they call them samba schools \u2013 various neighborhoods all band together and they compete against each other. So when an outsider comes in, you go to one of the samba schools and you wear their regalia. But it\u2019s all spangles and feathers no matter what. When it comes to the beautiful women, there\u2019s not too many spangles and feathers to be seen; it\u2019s just the beautiful women. This is a wonderful experience. My wife couldn\u2019t resist. She always wanted to dance in the samba school. She was five months pregnant at the time so it was probably not the best of times for her to be flying halfway around the world and dancing at 3:00 in the morning. Tim Ferriss: Up on some float potentially, who knows? Cal Fussman: Yeah, we weren\u2019t on a float. We were following the floats. We had a great time; it was a blast. The thing about the way I traveled was I always liked to live with the people. So the people that brought us into this samba school lived in a favela, which is in the mountains overlooking the city. Tim Ferriss: Very poor, typically; cobbled together electricity, oftentimes. If you haven\u2019t seen The City of God, Ciudad de Dios, I think it is, check it out. That will give you a pretty good glimpse. Cal Fussman: Some of the favelas are actually decent places to live. It\u2019s not all like you\u2019re living on a dirt floor. People figure out how to cobble electricity. This area wasn\u2019t an intensely poor area, but it\u2019s dangerous to be moving around on the streets. But look, we were in a group of people from this area. I felt completely safe because when you\u2019re with the people, you\u2019re with the people. Tim Ferriss: Safety in numbers with the locals. Cal Fussman: The locals, exactly. So we go through the dance, it\u2019s a really great time; the music, the crowd, the sheer pageantry of the whole thing. We\u2019re starting to walk back home; it\u2019s like 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. Now, right around that time we had heard of \u2013 I hope I\u2019m pronouncing it right; it\u2019s been awhile now. But the word was \u201cahasdao.\u201d Which was \u2013 what would happen is there are a lot of bridges in Rio that people can walk over. What young toughs and thugs would do is they would line both sides of the bridge and just be like looking over the water casually and waiting for an appropriate moment where everybody would just attack somebody or a group of people, to either steal something or you can get beat up. Stuff that wasn\u2019t so good is going to happen to you. We\u2019d heard about this. We knew it was kind of a dangerous time and we were staying in a place that while it was not dangerous on that street, we were still walking through dangerous places to get there. So it\u2019s really early in the morning, and we\u2019re walking across this bridge. My wife is Brazilian, and she looks Brazilian. I do not look Brazilian; I\u2019m like a gringo. It\u2019s the middle of February and at that point, I\u2019m back in New York. It\u2019s winter and I\u2019m looking really white. Tim Ferriss: Ghostly. Cal Fussman: I wouldn\u2019t say ghostly. Come on, Tim, give me a break. Tim Ferriss: Just trying to expand my adjectives; sorry. Cal Fussman: I know that, okay, if they\u2019re going to be looking to get somebody, they\u2019re coming after me. So we\u2019re all walking and now I\u2019m seeing these lines of people on the side, and I can see that they\u2019re looking over at us. I immediately know this is not good. Because we\u2019re in the middle of a fairly long bridge and we\u2019ve got like a half a mile to get to the other side where at least you could run or do something. There\u2019s nowhere for us to go except over the side and take a long tumble into the water. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like an Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom situation. Cal Fussman: It was really scary. It\u2019s interesting because when I think back on it, I have some measure of pride because there are just certain moments where you know, okay, bad shit\u2019s gonna happen. What am I going to do? You have no time to think. So I immediately say to my wife, who really understands what\u2019s going to happen even far better to me. I say, \u201cYou stay toward the middle but get away from me,\u201d because I know they\u2019re coming after me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I may get thrown off the side, I may get pummeled; who was to know? But I\u2019m just thinking if I could have them all turn on me, then my wife and my kid are going to be able to get away. So I move away and she is really nervous. I just said, \u201cWalk as fast as you can to get to the other side.\u201d I\u2019m going to slow it down and have their focus on me. In the meantime, one of the guys that was in our neighborhood, Toco \u2013 God bless him \u2013 he has stopped to take a piss under the bridge. This piss saved my life. Because what happened was, after he was done he came back up to the bridge and then he saw from behind what was going to happen. And he just came running, shouted to a few people and went running, and literally as everybody was about to turn on me \u2013 and the other thing about it I should point out, this is right after I fought Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. So I\u2019m also in the back of my mind saying the first guy, I can hit him. Maybe if he goes down, maybe it\u2019ll stop things for a second. Or maybe they\u2019re all just going to mow me down. But there were a lot of men looking, and they\u2019re coming after me. Tim Ferriss: No shortage of firearms in Brazil, either. Cal Fussman: You know what? I don\u2019t even think it was a matter of that because the setup was you didn\u2019t need it. All you had to do was just get 50 people to line up the side of a bridge and then wait for a moment of attack, and then attack. A gringo tourist dressed in spangles and feathers, what\u2019s he gonna do? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sorry. Just the sheer shock of some gringo in spangles and feathers knocking out the first guy would have been quite something. But please continue. Cal Fussman: Okay. So at this point, there\u2019s two thoughts. The first thought is, this could be it for me, but at least my wife and my son get out of here. So now I\u2019ve slowed it down. I\u2019m seeing she\u2019s moving really fast away. Okay, now I\u2019m waiting for the onslaught. Now, in the meantime, Toco sees what\u2019s going on, calls a few of his friends and he just sprints with his hand inside his shirt. He and his buddies, they literally surround me and they just stop the group. He\u2019s a guy who\u2019s looking like he\u2019s Al Capone, like hey, I\u2019ve got some serious firepower here. I\u2019m going to mow you all down if you don\u2019t leave him alone. He\u2019s with us. Then there\u2019s this fear among the crowd because we don\u2019t know what Toco\u2019s got under there. Tim Ferriss: Who knows? Cal Fussman: But he\u2019s got something. Toco says, \u201cJust back off, let us get to the other side of the bridge, we\u2019re not going to have any problems. Otherwise, there\u2019s going to be a lot of problems.\u201d And these guys, just everybody\u2019s staring at what\u2019s inside Toco\u2019s shirt. And so the others just remained still while I get to the other side. I\u2019m walking straight but Toco and the others are walking backward, making sure nobody\u2019s \u2013 with his hand in his shirt the whole time. We get to the other side and I said, \u201cMan, I didn\u2019t know you took a gun.\u201d And he pulled out a camera. Tim Ferriss: Man, what a bluff. Cal Fussman: Yeah. I owe my life to him and that quick bathroom stop and the camera. How did these people hear this story? Tim Ferriss: I have no idea. You can ask Ozro, @ozrohepworth can tell you more. You might be listening, Ozro, so let Cal know. One more and then perhaps we\u2019ll have to be continued. It\u2019s from a friend of mine, actually, a chef. \u201cAsk about his acceptance speech for the JBF.\u201d Cal Fussman: James Beard Foundation. That was something I didn\u2019t expect. Man, it\u2019s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like the Oscars for food. Cal Fussman: Yeah, it\u2019s like the Oscars for food and it was in a beautiful setting with thousands of people in New York. The thing about the James Beard Award is there are a lot of awards given out during these ceremonies. In the beginning people are paying attention, but then you get everybody coming up and you\u2019re warned. You\u2019ve got three minutes. You win an award, like no more than 180 seconds up behind the mic. Everybody knows there are a lot of awards and if people talk for 20 minutes, you\u2019re not going to get out of there until 4:00 in the morning. So you\u2019re told: three minutes, that\u2019s it. As the evening is going and more and more awards, and people are going up and I don\u2019t want to make fun of it but when you get people getting up and saying I\u2019d really like to thank Aunt Penelope for showing me how to skin a cucumber. Like it\u2019s over and over and over again. Tim Ferriss: A thousand variations of Aunt Penelope. Cal Fussman: Yeah, exactly. And so naturally, the crowd\u2019s attention is going to start to drift away. Then once it starts to drift, it\u2019s just not coming back. Unless Ted Allen gets an award, a well-known TV personality, people will: oh, there\u2019s Ted Allen, and there will be a silence. But if you\u2019re going through categories where only a few people know the person who has just won, the thing is just going on and on and on and now the whole crowd is having a good time at their table. Everybody\u2019s talking and having a great time but nobody\u2019s paying attention to Aunt Penelope no more. So here it is, I\u2019ve just written this story that took me ten years to write about being the sommelier at Windows in the World at the top of the World Trade Center just before the planes hit and the twin towers go down. It takes me ten years to be able to write this story; I was so traumatized. And I win the award for best essay. The award is called, I hear my name, and I go up to the stage to give my speech. And I look out and nobody is paying attention. There must be like three or four thousand people there in this grand setting; nobody. Tim Ferriss: Having a thousand conversations. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s right. I cannot describe all of the pain that I had to go through to get this piece out of me. And here I am, you get your medal and then you\u2019re going up to speak. I\u2019m looking out at this crowd and I can\u2019t speak out into that crowd because I feel like I\u2019ve got something important to say that goes back to 9/11, and there\u2019s nobody out there listening that I can see. So I just get behind the podium and I don\u2019t say anything. 15 seconds pass, 30 seconds pass. There\u2019s a woman over on the side, the one who\u2019s saying, \u201cThree minutes, three minutes.\u201d I\u2019ve just gone like 30 seconds and I haven\u2019t said a word. 45 seconds, a minute. Now you can start to see some people are saying what\u2019s going on? Why isn\u2019t he talking about his Aunt Penelope? Then, after it must have been a minute, maybe a minute and a half, Ted Allen stands up and in the crowd, throws his arm up like no! Like, Cal must speak! He didn\u2019t say that but something like that. A hush comes over the crowd, and still I said I am not going to say a word until there is complete silence in this place. And I just wait, and I wait and my three minutes is all up. Now there are people all around with their arms up saying, \u201cLet him speak! Let him speak!\u201d Then I spoke. The beauty of the experience \u2013 because I\u2019m only now understanding that speaking was something that I was born to do. When I look back on those moments, like that moment tells me yeah, you were born to do this. Because afterward, a chef like Paul Bartolotta, who has a great Italian restaurant, had it at the Win for many years, has won James Beard awards for himself, came over to me and he just said, \u201cYou took back the crowd.\u201d At the time, I didn\u2019t understand it. But now that I\u2019m starting to give speeches, now it makes sense. Yeah, I do have this and I have to use it. It would be terrible for me not to use it. I\u2019m supposed to use it. But that was only like a flicker, and it was about five years after that before I started talking, but it was there. Tim Ferriss: Some more questions when we get back from festivities? Cal Fussman: A hundred percent. You know, we could spend all tomorrow talking if you want. I\u2019ve got this guy who\u2019s managing me now, Kevin the Manager. And he says, \u201cCal, you go on and you do these three and a half hour podcasts, like three and a half hours. Do you realize how long that is?\u201d And then I said to him, \u201cKevin, it was fun. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d So we can talk all tomorrow. Tim Ferriss: Alright, fantastic. [Inaudible] barrel sauna use, which I\u2019ll fill people in on, perhaps. One of my newest distractions/saviors but to be continued. This is great fun and we will continue. All right. This is round two picking up in the a.m. We have two mugs full of yerba mate tea and I thought we would tackle some questions from listeners. One we can start with is Nick Styman: which interview in his career went worst? Discuss the aftermath. Cal Fussman: Okay, there\u2019s a good story to that one. I don\u2019t know if many people remember a guy named William Buckley. He was an incredible intellect who was at the foundation of the Conservative party. But he had a TV show back in the \u201860s that was just fantastic. This guy had an amazing intellect and a vocabulary that you\u2019d only dream of. I don\u2019t know why but he was the only person I have ever been frightened to interview. Just because \u2013 well, I\u2019ll tell you why. Back in the \u201860s, he challenged Robert Kennedy to a debate on TV on his show. Robert Kennedy wouldn\u2019t go. So Buckley comes on the next show and he spoke in this kind of effete way, and he basically says, \u201cWell, you know, I invited Robert Kennedy to come and debate me. He has refused. This is clearly a case of the baloney rejecting the grinder.\u201d Tim Ferriss: What a line, wow. Cal Fussman: He was like that all the time. He could take you apart if he wanted to just with the magnificence of his language. And I don\u2019t know what it was but I was really scared. Look, the guy was way older than me. He had seen much more than me. Tim Ferriss: How old were you at the time? Just roughly. Cal Fussman: Oh, let\u2019s see. Probably late 30s, early 40s? Tim Ferriss: So not totally green. Cal Fussman: No, that\u2019s the point. That\u2019s the point. I had no reason to fear him. I\u2019d already done many \u201cWhat I\u2019ve Learned\u201d interviews. I\u2019d already met a lot of famous people, people who had done big things. But I was just scared. So I said to myself, you\u2019ve really got to be prepared for this interview like no other interview before. And so I did all my research. I read and read and read, and I watched what I could of him. For two days before the interview, I stopped eating. Tim Ferriss: Was this part of your performance enhancement plan or was that just nerves? Cal Fussman: I just wanted to be laser focused when I walked in there. Tim Ferriss: Like a hawk. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: Or hunting like a peregrine falcon; they\u2019ll starve to make their senses more acute, okay. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s exactly it. I wanted my senses to be laser focused when I walked in there. There was no way that this guy \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Food was going to throw you off. Cal Fussman: I\u2019m outside of his apartment in New York like a half an hour early. I\u2019m just pacing back and forth. I\u2019m like, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to take you apart. You\u2019re gonna stay with him, Cal. This guy is amazing but you\u2019re going to stay with him. Finally, the appointed hour arrives. It\u2019s like 11:00 in the morning. I go and I knock on his door. The door swings open, and he throws his arms out wide and he says, \u201cWelcome to my home.\u201d And then he starts rubbing his hands together and he says, with a big smile on his face, \u201cA little scotch?\u201d Now I\u2019m screwed. Now I\u2019m screwed because when I traveled around the world, if you offered me something to eat or something to drink, I drank it or I ate it. I did some crazy stuff. I remember going to the Nile for the first time and just walking up and drinking out of it just to say, okay, I\u2019m at one with you here. And the next three days, I couldn\u2019t leave my hotel room; I was over the toilet. But that was my mentality. If you serve it, I have ultimate respect. I will eat it or drink it. So now he\u2019s saying, \u201cHave this scotch.\u201d I know if I put this scotch to my lips, within 20 minutes I\u2019m going to be slurring my words or out of it because I\u2019m just too clean for it. So I looked at him, and I said \u2013 God, I regret it. It gives me shivers just to repeat it. I said, \u201cHow about a little water?\u201d And he looks at me and his nose goes up in the air and he says, \u201cOh.\u201d And in that \u201coh\u201d was, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be that kind of interview, is it?\u201d And the interview was done. It was just \u2013 I had not respected him. Look, my whole way of interviewing is I\u2019m going to make you feel like you\u2019re at home. So here\u2019s a guy who opened the door to his home, threw out his arms to embrace me, offered me \u2013 who knows \u2013 probably a 50-year-old single malt and I just said no. I couldn\u2019t even make him feel at home in his home. We sit down and in fairness to myself, when I went back and listened to the interview, it wasn\u2019t that bad. But it could have been great. Tim Ferriss: Right, you know how much better it could have been. Cal Fussman: Yeah. Because I just set it off on such a wrong note, and it ended way earlier than it should have ended. I walked away saying, you will never, ever do that again. That is a mistake you never should have made and I hope you learned your lesson. So what happened in the aftermath is a good part of that question. Because okay, I\u2019m getting ready to hand the piece in and I\u2019m just making it work. It\u2019s one of those, if you\u2019re a pole-vaulter and you\u2019re just getting over the bar. Tim Ferriss: Just barely clearing it. Cal Fussman: Yeah, and it\u2019s like shaking. Like you\u2019ve nicked it and it\u2019s shaking. But I feel, as I\u2019m about to hand it in, that it\u2019s still there and I\u2019m coming down and I\u2019m going to have a soft landing here. So phew. And I get a phone call, and it\u2019s bad news, Cal, bad news. It\u2019s from the editor. What\u2019s going on? Well, William Buckley had written a piece for Esquire like 30 or 40 years ago. There were some problems with it and a legal agreement was made between William Buckley and Esquire that piece would never again run; it would never be republished. And Esquire had just put out a huge book of great stories. Tim Ferriss: Oh, including his piece. Cal Fussman: Because what happened was there had been maybe eight editors in between the time that happened. Tim Ferriss: Too many regime changes. Cal Fussman: Yeah, and nobody knew about this. Only Buckley and his lawyers knew and they basically said, \u201cHey, get that book off the racks. You can\u2019t do this.\u201d So they said there\u2019s just no way we can run the interview. I got a reprieve. Tim Ferriss: You got a reprieve and a pardon at the last minute. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s right. I got a last minute pardon. The lesson was the truly important thing because I will never, ever go into an interview nervous because it serves no purpose. It only hurts you. Tim Ferriss: Were there points in the future when you felt the involuntary nerves kicking in and if so, what would you say to yourself? Cal Fussman: No, because the experience scarred me. Remember the scotch? Now, I\u2019ll take ice cream into interviews. Tim Ferriss: So you skipped the peregrine falcon prep after that. Cal Fussman: Look, do the prep. Tim Ferriss: Not the prep, but the fasting approach. Cal Fussman: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous. Because if you\u2019re going intense, you\u2019re going to transmit that tenseness into the interview, into the person, into the subject. Look, there are a lot of interviewers who do things different ways. I just did a piece with Jorge Ramos, the Univision anchor who Donald Trump pitched out of the interview in Iowa awhile back. He has a completely different approach. He goes into the interview as if it\u2019s a war. Because a lot of the people that he\u2019s interviewing could have been dictators, or presidents who took power in unscrupulous ways. He knows he may only have a few minutes and he may be getting thrown out. So he\u2019s going to come at them with the toughest questions right from the start. Tim Ferriss: Biggest left hook, right at the bell of the first round. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s right. And he\u2019s had a great career out of it. But look, his background was completely different from mine because he grew up in Mexico where basically the media was censored, so he was a reaction to that. Everything he does is a reaction to censorship. It\u2019s a reaction to people having power and taking advantage of those who don\u2019t have it. He sees journalism as more than just asking a question. He sees it as defending people. I really don\u2019t go into an interview to defend anybody. In fact, it\u2019s kind of interesting because some people say, what happens when you get people who lie to you? I say, the way I write, it\u2019s impossible for somebody to lie to me because I write in other people\u2019s words. So if they lie to me, their lie is going to be printed on the page exactly the way they told it. So basically, the truth is, they\u2019re a liar. Because anybody who knows the truth is going to know that they lied. So very, very different styles. Tim Ferriss: Very different styles. We were talking yesterday about some prep that I was doing for an interview where I wanted to watch a movie. We ended up watching a good part of it together. But I was nervous that I wouldn\u2019t have the chance to see it beforehand, due to some technological issues. You mentioned that, for instance, Larry King doesn\u2019t want to know anything about \u2013 and feel free to add to this \u2013 say, a given movie that\u2019s coming out that a guest is a part of because he wants to, I suppose, see it with fresh eyes and ask the questions that a beginner might ask, or someone who\u2019s unfamiliar with it. How does your style differ from, say, Larry\u2019s? Of course, you spend a lot of time with Larry. Cal Fussman: Yeah. Larry\u2019s basic idea is, I am thinking like the person who\u2019s listening. They haven\u2019t seen the movie. They haven\u2019t gotten a chance to get a preview so why should I, Larry King, be in the position to tell them what happens? Better for him to put \u2013 oh, there\u2019s Molly. Tim Ferriss: Molly\u2019s awake now, guys. She was sedated yesterday but she\u2019s full of beans today. I will close that door if she continues her home defense against squirrels and butterflies. Sorry, Cal. Cal Fussman: So Larry\u2019s basic feeling is hey, I am going to talk to this person who made the movie, or was in the movie, or who wrote the book as if I just sat next to them on an airplane seat. Oh, you wrote that book? What\u2019s it about? And then let the conversation go from there. That\u2019s a great strategy because it\u2019s very natural and it allows the person to be just as natural. I\u2019ve gone both ways. In fact, I don\u2019t really follow pop culture that much and certainly when I moved out to Los Angeles in \u201808, rarely followed it before then. Once you\u2019re in LA, it\u2019s hard to not be part of the pop culture because it\u2019s all around you. Esquire, as soon as I moved out there, they came up with a pretty funny idea, knowing that I didn\u2019t know much about current movies. They hatched a plan to send me out to do a cover story but the only thing they told me was, \u201cWe just want you to go out and do a story about a guy; his name is Gerry.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat else?\u201d That\u2019s it, just \u201cHis name is Gerry.\u201d And they gave me his address. Tim Ferriss: Such a setup. Cal Fussman: Not only that but they told me, \u201cLook, it\u2019s just a short interview. Don\u2019t sweat it. His name\u2019s Gerry. Just go out and talk to him for a few minutes and come back and write something up.\u201d It didn\u2019t seem like a big trick to me. In the meantime, Gerard Butler, the actor, is waiting in his house and he\u2019s appeared in a few movies at this point, one of which was 300. Another one was Phantom of the Opera. I hadn\u2019t seen either of those movies and I had no idea who he was. He is sitting at home getting his first cover story for Esquire. He\u2019s consented to a three-hour interview. Tim Ferriss: A few minutes. Cal Fussman: Yeah, I\u2019m going in a few minutes for Gerry and he\u2019s thinking: okay, cover story, Esquire. So I knock on the door and I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, is Gerry here?\u201d And then I said, \u201cTo be honest, I have no idea who you are but the magazine has sent me to interview you for a few minutes.\u201d H e\u2019s looking at me and his eyes are squinting, like this guy\u2019s putting me on. This guy\u2019s putting me on. And I said, \u201cNo, no, no. Really I have no idea who you are.\u201d He\u2019s caught between the squinting of the eyes and then there\u2019s a smile on his face because he\u2019s an actor who can go with it. So he wants to go with it but he\u2019s wary. Tim Ferriss: Understandably. Cal Fussman: This is a setup, this is a setup. And he keeps looking for that little string to pull that\u2019s going to take the garment and just unravel it and prove that I\u2019m an imposter. But there\u2019s nothing he can do because I have no idea who this guy is. I said to him, \u201cThe good thing about this is for ten years I\u2019ve traveled around the world and I would just get on trains and sit next to people, and we\u2019d just go and get a chance to meet each other. So why don\u2019t we just approach it like that?\u201d So he\u2019s \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Just that question, like I don\u2019t believe you, I don\u2019t believe it, I don\u2019t believe this. Then he starts telling me he\u2019s from Paisley in Scotland. I think, at first, I couldn\u2019t tell if it was Australia, is it England, is it Scotland? Tim Ferriss: The accent. Cal Fussman: Yeah. Then I said, \u201cScotland?\u201d And he says \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d Then he starts giving me his background and it\u2019s only about 20 minutes into the interview where it comes out. And then I started to act. I said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re an actor?\u201d And he says, \u201cThis is just the biggest bunch of malarkey. I know you\u2019re a film buff, this whole thing is being recorded to put me on.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, Gerry, I have no idea who you are.\u201d And now the rest of this interview, he\u2019s like trying to prove to me that he is a world class actor. Tim Ferriss: Poor guy. Cal Fussman: The amazing thing about it was we\u2019re talking and talking, and still it hasn\u2019t occurred to me that this is a cover story. I still think this is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: A little interview; a few minutes with Gerry. Cal Fussman: Yeah. So at a certain point we take a little break, and he says, \u201cYou need to use the bathroom? Use the one off my bedroom. Here, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d We start walking into his bedroom and there is an Esquire on a nightstand, and it\u2019s got Megan Fox, the actress, on the cover. He makes this offhand comment, like: \u201cGeez, why would they want to put me on the cover of Esquire when you can have Megan Fox?\u201d And then it hits me: oh, my God, I\u2019ve got to write a cover story about this. Oh, no. So we sat back down and I said \u201cAlright, Gerry.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s shift gears here. Cal Fussman: \u201cWhat movies were you in?\u201d He said something like, \u201cReally?\u201d He brings up, he says well \u2013 this was the topper. He says, \u201cI was in 300.\u201d And I haven\u2019t seen it. I said, \u201c300, you know, I remember seeing \u2013 think I saw a poster of that movie. It was these kind of gladiator guys, and I remember a beard.\u201d And Gerry says, \u201cThat was me! That was me!\u201d We\u2019re talking about 300 and he says, \u201cIn this issue with Megan Fox on the cover, it also had a story, \u201cThe 75 Movies that Every Man Must See.\u201d So he says, \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d And he picks up this issue and he says, \u201cI guarantee you 300 is one of the 75 movies that every man must see. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He opens it up to the story. He goes on page one and he\u2019s looking. \u201cThese movies are pretty good.\u201d He gets to page two. \u201cYeah, that is really good.\u201d And he\u2019s not seeing 300. He turns the page and he says, \u201cFuckers!\u201d He turns the next page. \u201cFuck! Fuck!\u201d Then he gets to the last page; it\u2019s not there. He\u2019s like, \u201cFuck! How could they not put 300 in here?\u201d And I\u2019m saying okay, okay, what else are we in? He said, \u201cPhantom of the Opera.\u201d Come on, Gerry. You can\u2019t sing like that. I saw that Broadway show. I got roped into it. I don\u2019t like musicals but my wife does and so we went. Like you can\u2019t sing like that. \u201cI was the phantom!\u201d And so the whole interview is going on where he\u2019s trying to prove to me that he\u2019s an actor and belongs on the cover of Esquire. And we have a great time. True to the actual beginning of the interview where I said to him, \u201cLook, I sit down on trains with people and they take me home.\u201d At the end of the interview he\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, you want to use my big screen? Come back anytime.\u201d Like we\u2019re tight. It\u2019s been a great time. I\u2019m getting ready to leave, and he disappears. And right before I leave, the house fills with music from Phantom of the Opera. He comes down and he starts singing, note for note, to the music. And I said, \u201cOkay, Gerry. I know who you are.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Wow. Cal Fussman: So there was a case where I had not a clue \u2013 not a clue \u2013 who I was interviewing and it works, just being natural. Tim Ferriss: That would work for you; also not for all interviewers, right? Given your background, in the same way that perhaps if you went into a war conflict interview format where you had three minutes to hit someone with a left hook, you might not be as adaptable as the Univision interviewer, right? That format, the stranger on the train scenario, is something you\u2019ve very well adapted to take advantage of. Cal Fussman: You know, it\u2019s interesting. Jorge Ramos was telling me a story. The only time that he actually got thrown out of an interview or pushed away before Donald Trump was with Fidel Castro. And it was a very tricky situation he was in, and Castro knew it. Castro knew who he was. So they\u2019re at a conference, and Jorge manages to get next to Castro, and he\u2019s got his mic and he starts asking him questions. What Castro did was put his arm around Jorge. Tim Ferriss: For photos and whatnot? Cal Fussman: Because the camera is in on this. And so the look now is that you\u2019re pals. Which, if you\u2019re Jorge, you do not want to be seen as pals with \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s clever, though, on the part of Fidel. Cal Fussman: Right. So Jorge has got to come back at him and manage to wriggle away. Tim Ferriss: To wriggle away like a toddler. Cal Fussman: Wriggle away and then hit him with a tough question, at which point one of Castro\u2019s bodyguards elbowed him away like, out, this is over. I never have to think like that because my feeling is if somebody\u2019s going to feel comfortable with me, then I\u2019ll get to the deep, eternal truths. I don\u2019t want to push them back or off guard, or make them nervous or make them think about what they have to say. So it\u2019s completely different styles. Tim Ferriss: Hence, the scotch rule. Cal Fussman: Yeah, hence the scotch rule. Tim Ferriss: There are, for people who are wondering, and there are many questions that popped up about questions since that\u2019s what many people associate you with, good questions. And I feel like I should mention that there are very contrasting styles, even very different from both Larry\u2019s approach, your approach, and Jorge Ramos\u2019 approach, such as James Lipton, Inside the Actor\u2019s Studio. I\u2019ve spent time with some of his researchers who I\u2019ve paid to look at past transcripts of my podcasts to try to help me improve. But the format is completely different. Because in the case of, say, James Lipton, I believe he knows the answer to every question he\u2019s going to ask. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of in-depth research and prep that goes into it. For me personally, it really kind of depends on the guest and the circumstances. Some are really, really deeply researched, particularly if I\u2019m nervous. Then others, I\u2019m coming in relatively blind because I feel like it\u2019s a complex enough subject that I want to have myself in the shoes of the majority of the people listening, if that makes sense, like physics or mathematics or something like that. Who are some interviewers that you greatly admire, alive or dead, besides Larry? Cal Fussman: There are very few good interviewers that I don\u2019t admire. This conversation is kind of explaining it all. They were all completely different so that when I look at them, I see what they\u2019re doing, I see how they\u2019re doing it. I admire Barbara Walters and I know that she has scripted her interviews, a little different from Lipton because she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s coming. But she\u2019s got question No. 1, question No. 2, question No. 3. She has story boarded her interviews from start to finish, and meticulously. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s a progression. There\u2019s an arc. Cal Fussman: I can see how she makes it work for her. Charlie Rose, the research that he does is absolutely fantastic. The interesting thing about Charlie Rose is when he\u2019s interviewing somebody, you think like he\u2019s on almost an equal level of intelligence or material as the person that he\u2019s interviewing. That works great for him. Matt Lauer is a master at getting people to feel comfortable. I know where this comes from because I interviewed him. When he was a kid, he worked in a men\u2019s shop. He said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re a salesman, you have to observe the person coming in through the door, see what they\u2019re looking at, what\u2019s the right time to approach, when is it time to back off.\u201d All of that translates into his interviews and you can see why he makes people feel so comfortable. It came from that clothing store. Tim Ferriss: Same story, different background with Barbara Walters, right? You were mentioning this to me yesterday. If you\u2019d elaborate on that for a second, also, just as another example of how the background forms the interviewer? Cal Fussman: With Barbara Walters, her dad owned a famous nightclub in New York called the Latin Quarter. So all the famous celebrities were in this place night after night. She was sitting and talking with them as if they were friends. That allowed her, later on in life, to have that same vibe in her conversations with people while she interviewed them, because she was just accustomed to sitting next to them and casually talking to them. If you don\u2019t have that experience, you might be put off; you might be a little nervous. And that might be something you have to overcome by repeatedly doing it. But probably in her case, the first time she sat in on a celebrity interview, it was not much different from being at her dad\u2019s nightclub. Tim Ferriss: For someone who doesn\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t want people to get the impression that you have to have this extensive childhood experience with something or another to become a good interviewer, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, necessarily. Maybe I\u2019m missing something in my own background. There are a number of questions to this effect. We\u2019ve chatted about this a little bit. But for instance, here\u2019s a question from David Dronet, what are the top three specific questions he asks most often during interviews that he finds are the most revealing? Now, I suspect I know what part of your answer will be to this. But the two that I would offer for people who are opening an interview and are really nervous, one was what you asked \u2013 where you from? Very simple. The other one that seems to buy a lot of time for me in my experience if I just don\u2019t know where to go or where to start, I\u2019ll say: tell me the story of how you became X, an actor or whatever. You\u2019ve immediately bought yourself probably five minutes of time to figure out what your next move is, and you\u2019ll get something in the answer that will help you figure out your next move. But how would you answer this question, because I\u2019m sure you get some variation of this question all the time. Cal Fussman: The big thing that I\u2019m noticing from the people who ask this question, because once I started to speak, this question kept coming up again and again. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s the Holy Grail of questions, here, so I could use them? I always say it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a Holy Grail of questions. Look, I come prepared. I\u2019ve got like 200 questions in my mind when I show up for an interview because I\u2019ve thought about them. I\u2019ve written them down and then I\u2019ve ripped them up. The thing is, it\u2019s not that first question that I\u2019m really dependent on. That first question is just opening the door. Then the answer is going to spark my second question. And that\u2019s going to take me down a flight of steps, like deeper into the person\u2019s soul. And then when they answer the second question, that\u2019s going to bring up a third question. By the sixth answer, maybe that\u2019s where I wanted to go with my first question. So it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s not a use this and you will be successful, too. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s not an incantation? Cal Fussman: Yeah. It\u2019s also filled with curiosity. Because what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re just listening to see where the answers take you. It\u2019s the answers that are going to take you where you want to go. The questions are there just to open the doors for the answers. So relying on one question to get you to the bottom of something is something I wouldn\u2019t do. But you know what? That\u2019s a good question for Jorge Ramos because he\u2019s had to think really carefully. If he knows I\u2019ve only got five minutes with this president of a Latin American country, and he\u2019s got to ask something that\u2019s going to get a response that everybody talks about, he might ask a question like, how much did your house cost? Then if the person says well, I don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know how much your house costs? Tim Ferriss: Any answer is an answer, in that case. I won\u2019t answer that tells you quite a lot. The mask tells you more than what\u2019s underneath the mask. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s what he\u2019s working in. He\u2019s really thinking hard about what he\u2019s going to ask, knowing that he doesn\u2019t have much time and also knowing that he\u2019s there for the people. Tim Ferriss: Right. This is a point that I think about quite a lot but in the converse way. Meaning, I\u2019ll have guests on who are known or have been known at some point for some type of scandal. If you\u2019re in the public eye long enough, eventually something\u2019s going to come up. You\u2019re going to make a misstep, you\u2019re going to say something stupid. And there are some fans \u2013 not a lot \u2013 who are like, why didn\u2019t you ask him about this? Why didn\u2019t you ask her about that? In my case, I do have a lot of time. I have two to three hours to uncover, in my particular format, tactics and tools and so on. So if I ask how much did your house cost? That\u2019s the equivalent of not accepting the scotch times a hundred. They\u2019ll go, oh, it\u2019s one of these, and the doors get shut. That\u2019s effectively the end of the interview, even if it lasts another two hours. They will not give me anything they wouldn\u2019t give a stranger who\u2019s potentially hostile. So it\u2019s a completely different style of interviewing. Cal Fussman: But you know what? The way I would approach that is not with a direct question, but just by allowing the conversation to circle around that area and invite him or her to explain the scandal through that and then you can be into it. Best example I can give you about that is when Larry King was just getting started in Miami on radio. He was sitting at a table with a friend of his at the time, Jackie Gleason, Honeymooners? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Cal Fussman: So they had become friends. Jackie had asked this question around the table, what\u2019s impossible? I guess there was a doctor at the table who said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never have artificial blood.\u201d And it gets to Larry, and Larry says, \u201cWhat\u2019s impossible? I have a three-hour radio show. Getting Frank Sinatra to appear on my radio show, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d And Jackie Gleason pointed to him and said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d As it turned out, Frank had been doing a concert or a series of concerts and lost his voice and needed to be replaced one night. He called Jackie, and he said, \u201cHey, Jackie, can you go on and do a comedy bit for me so that nobody\u2019s upset?\u201d Frank says, \u201cI owe you one.\u201d So after that conversation with Larry and the others, Jackie calls up Frank and says, \u201cHey, Frank. This is the one. There\u2019s this kid, Larry King. He\u2019s just starting out in radio, Miami Beach. He\u2019s got a three-hour show. I need you to go on for three hours.\u201d Frank says, \u201cYou want it? You got it.\u201d Now, nobody can believe it. This is like a little radio station. Tim Ferriss: At the time, I\u2019m imagining that Sinatra is the biggest of the big. Cal Fussman: Yeah. Not only that, but Frank, as his PR guy points out, the public relations guy is basically employed to say no to all these requests like this. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m very familiar. Cal Fussman: The people at the radio station can\u2019t believe it because Larry says, \u201cI got Frank Sinatra coming in Friday night,\u201d or whatever night it was and the radio wants to do all this publicity. They say, \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s gonna show?\u201d This is a little station. Larry King is not big time; this is what made Larry King big time. The radio station is calling over to where Frank is staying, asking just to get a confirmation. No response, no response, no response. The show was on at 9:00. Finally, at two minutes to 9:00, Frank comes through the door with his publicist. And the publicist pulls Larry aside and says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you got this because my job is to not let this happen. But he said he wants to do it. Okay, I\u2019m just telling you one thing. Do not ask about the kidnapping of his son, just don\u2019t.\u201d And Larry is young and so grateful \u2013 whatever you say, whatever you say. The interview starts, and Larry is dumbfounded. So he says to Frank \u2013 talk about starting an interview \u2013 he says to Frank \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Where are you from? No, I\u2019m just kidding. Cal Fussman: No, even better. He says, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Frank explained, and Larry didn\u2019t even know the back-story. So Frank is having to explain to him, \u201cGleason substituted for me and I owed him one. Then he said: Frank, this is the one. And so I\u2019m here.\u201d The interview starts going, and an hour passes or whatever. And midway into the interview, Frank is feeling very comfortable. Larry says to him, \u201cDo you feel, Frank, you\u2019ve ever gotten a bum rap?\u201d Frank says, \u201cAbsolutely. In the case of my son getting kidnapped.\u201d And then he just goes into the whole story. So Larry didn\u2019t ask the question directly; he just made Frank feel at home. So that is more where I line up, as opposed to the style of going in there and saying we\u2019ve got Sinatra. Tim Ferriss: Corner the wild beast. Cal Fussman: Yeah. The camera\u2019s in front of him. If we ask him about it and he doesn\u2019t want to answer, we\u2019re still going to get his reaction. I don\u2019t go that way. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s also, from my perspective, a very mercenary way of doing things and a very transactional away. Contrasted with if you take the approach that Larry did, he\u2019s developing friendships, not just good tape, over time. Cal Fussman: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: At least, I would say, a third of the guests that I\u2019ve had on the podcast came as recommendations from other guests and introductions. That wouldn\u2019t happen if I had a transactional \u201cgotcha\u201d type of approach. And just to reiterate what you said, the exact, same experience is something I\u2019ve had on at least two dozen of my interviews. In the sense that I always ask guests beforehand, because the show is not about making people look bad; it\u2019s about tactics and routines and habits and all the stuff that people can use. I\u2019ll ask, \u201cIs there anything you really don\u2019t want to talk about or prefer not to talk about?\u201d And not often, but every once in a while somebody will say I really don\u2019t want to talk about X. If I make them feel comfortable, and if I do one thing which Neil Strauss, who is a very good writer and very accomplished interviewer for Rolling Stone and New York Times, he said to me, \u201cIf you want them to be vulnerable, be vulnerable yourself.\u00a0Give up some details of your life that are very vulnerable.\u201d So I made that a habit. I\u2019d say in about half of the cases, they end up talking about exactly the thing they said they didn\u2019t want to talk about. They bring it up themselves. Cal Fussman: It only makes sense because when people feel comfortable, then they\u2019re going to speak normally. They\u2019re going to forget they\u2019re being interviewed. Later on in life, Frank actually wrote Larry a note that said, \u201cYou make the cameras disappear.\u201d I think that\u2019s what you, as an interviewer, want to do. You want to make people forget they\u2019re being interviewed and just speak with you naturally. Now, that\u2019s just my style. Other people, they want it to be known it\u2019s an interview. If you show up with a pad in front of you and cameras, then it\u2019s an interview. The pad is going to tell the person that is across from you, there are questions written down. This is an interview. Be advised. So that\u2019s just something I would never, never do but that\u2019s just me; that\u2019s just my style. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned that you think about the questions, write down the questions, then tear them up. I\u2019m curious about this. Do you review a list of questions and then the day before, or before you walk into someone\u2019s house, just tear it up into little shreds and throw it in a wastebasket? What does your process look like for adding the ammo to your brain? Cal Fussman: It\u2019s a matter of you do your research. Then there\u2019s a period of curiosity where you\u2019ve taken in all this information, and now what are you curious about? So you just start writing down questions. For me, it comes very easily. I\u2019ll just start writing, writing, writing and then pages will be filled up. The way I look at it, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m putting songs in a jukebox and the questions are my songs. I\u2019m just going to have these songs in there. They\u2019re in my head. I know the words to the songs. I can sing the songs. Then I rip them up. It\u2019s more of like a ceremonial act. The questions are no longer on paper; they\u2019re in my head. So when I go into the interview, interesting things start happening. No. 1, because all these questions are in my head, I\u2019m never at a loss for a question. I\u2019ve talked to some writers who say what happens when you run out of questions? Well, I don\u2019t because my jukebox is filled. But more than that, what will happen is I\u2019ll ask a question, and I\u2019ll get a response and then I\u2019m working off the responses. But oftentimes, the response will lead to a question I\u2019ve already thought of. So it\u2019s like they\u2019re hitting the jukebox and they\u2019re playing the music. They\u2019re getting the question that they want because that\u2019s where they were going. Tim Ferriss: Right, they used the proper cue, in a sense. Cal Fussman: Right. So my mind was prepared to ask them the question that they wanted to hear to make them more comfortable. My style \u2013 and other people can try it and see if it works for them \u2013but there\u2019s something relaxing about it to me. I\u2019ve interviewed people who have shows on TV where they have to interview people, and I come in without any questions or pad. And you can see this shocked look on their faces. You don\u2019t write down your questions? Because they might feel like, what will I do on camera if I can\u2019t think of a question? It might look bad. Having that pad there is a safety net. But once you do it this way a few times, you\u2019re free. Tim Ferriss: Neil does the same thing, Neil Strauss. I don\u2019t think he tears them up but he folds it up and puts it in his pocket and doesn\u2019t look at it at all. And I think if I were to underscore something that you both have in common, it\u2019s that you\u2019re very good at getting people to open up about things that they would be disinclined to open up about normally in an interview. I think that\u2019s a big part of it. It\u2019s like if you have a camera with a flashing red light, people put on their body armor. The more you can make it a conversation as opposed to an interview, like you said, if you can remove the symptoms of an interview so to speak, the pad of paper, the flashing lights, the more naturally people will engage with you and the more they will share. Cal Fussman: Now you\u2019re getting into Oprah territory. Imagine this. You\u2019ve got the flashing lights, you\u2019ve got an audience that\u2019s reacting, and then you\u2019ve got a subject on the couch. And she is getting them to speak about things that are very intimate in front of a crowd and the flashing lights. That\u2019s a high, high level of jiu-jitsu. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, she\u2019s amazing. If you were to ask me what is impossible, my answer currently would be getting Oprah on my three-hour podcast, so we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see if that manifests something. Cal Fussman: I wish I could say you got it. Tim Ferriss: You got it. Oprah owes me a solid. Cal Fussman: Oprah owes me one. Don\u2019t worry about this. Tim Ferriss: This may have a good amount of overlap with things we\u2019ve already talked about, but this is from Devon Hedgepess \u2013 best strategies to get to the heart while interviewing? Cal Fussman: Find out what they love. I mean, it\u2019s that simple. Especially if you\u2019re able to do the research before, just hone in on something they\u2019re passionate about and they love talking about and just ask them about it. They\u2019re going to be happy to talk about it. It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s the exact opposite of going in feeling like a journalist who is determined to get a question answered. I\u2019ve got to get this. You talked about \u201cgotcha\u201d but there\u2019s like a level underneath that that\u2019s not so much gotcha, it\u2019s a legitimate okay, we need to know this. If you go in trying to grab something from anyone, they\u2019re going to protect it. So just make people relax by finding out what they like and then have them talk about it. Tim Ferriss: This is really good advice. It took me a long time to figure out that, for myself at least, and I\u2019m still very much a novice, but sometimes the best place to start is really far off of any topic they\u2019ve covered in interviews related to their profession. I remember interviewing Edward Norton, and I\u2019d spent a good amount of time with Edward. But the way he interacts in interviews could be very different than the way he interacts over coffee having normal conversation. So I wanted to make him feel as relaxed as possible, so we just talked about surfing for the first five to ten minutes of the interview. Cal Fussman: I remember that. Tim Ferriss: We were sitting out on the Malibu Pier overlooking the water. We could see the surf line up. And I was like, okay, let\u2019s talk about surfing. Cal Fussman: That\u2019s just a clear example of doing something that\u2019s very natural and getting somebody to feel at one with you and the place. To me, making the person, the subject, feel safe and comfortable, that\u2019s where it all starts. Obviously there\u2019s research before and there\u2019s the preparation of questions. But if you can\u2019t make a person feel safe, forget it. Although look, that\u2019s just me. Jorge Ramos is going in there. He is not making them feel safe and he makes it work for him. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s doing the Jon Snow charging into battle approach. Cal Fussman: Yeah. From where he comes from, that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you need that. He can\u2019t go in warm and fuzzy; that won\u2019t work, I wouldn\u2019t think. Cal Fussman: His audience is his audience because they know he\u2019s going in to fight for them. A big part of this is realizing who you are. Where do you come from, how do you want to get your own message across? Just the way you were speaking, you\u2019re helping to uplift people. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m trying, yeah. Cal Fussman: So your style is based on that. I don\u2019t know that I ever looked at an interview as a way of uplifting somebody but it\u2019s a very interesting way for me to look at it. Because interestingly, I don\u2019t do it in interviews but when I give speeches or workshops, that\u2019s what I do; I\u2019m uplifting people. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s the intention. Cal Fussman: Yeah. We\u2019ve been talking about this over the last couple of days and you just lit the light bulb in my head. Because I\u2019ve been saying to myself, what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m kind of moving into a place where I\u2019m like a player coach, now. That\u2019s not who I was, but I\u2019m finding that I really enjoy this in a way that I didn\u2019t get out of writing a story in a magazine. I just understood why in this conversation. Because it allows me to do what you do in an interview. It allows me to help uplift people. So if people are working in a company and the company is not hiring the right people because they\u2019re not interviewing them in the right way, I can give them information that is going to help them hire better and have a better company, and that makes me feel great. At the end of it, they\u2019re saying thank you and hugging me. Generally at the end of an interview, I hug people sometimes at the end of interviews, and people say thanks. But it\u2019s a different kind of thanks. When somebody walks out of an interview and says thanks, it\u2019s hey, that was a really good time. When somebody walks out of a workshop and says thank you, it\u2019s a very different thing. There was this one woman \u2013 man, this is just hitting me as we\u2019re talking \u2013 who, at the end of this workshop, says, \u201cYou know, I spend more time on my job than I do at home. I hire the people that are around me on my job. I didn\u2019t know any of this about interviewing until you told us, and this is going to affect all the people I put around me going forward. Thank you.\u201d That was an experience that I\u2019d never had before. So this is why \u2013 I\u2019m just understanding this now. Why I\u2019m compelled to go in this other direction. Tim Ferriss: Well, I\u2019m excited to see the new direction. We also have some barbecue to eat in the not-too-distant future. So I think this has been great fun. We have so much more we could talk about: how to approach second time interviews, we were going to talk about George Clooney. Maybe that\u2019ll be in part three. There\u2019s so much that we could cover and so many great stories. But where can people find you online and where can they say hi? Cal Fussman: You\u2019ve got calfussman.com, and I just got Kevin the manager to make sure that when you send an email in, he\u2019ll get it to me. Tim Ferriss: Kevin the manager. Cal Fussman: Kevin the manager. He\u2019ll get it to me and we\u2019ll get back to you. Tim Ferriss: And then on Twitter, is it @calfussman? Cal Fussman: Yeah. I\u2019ve got to do a better job on Twitter. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s see if I can get Jocko Willink to sit you down and give you a tutorial. He\u2019s got plenty to do, but he\u2019s doing a great job on Twitter. Cal Fussman: I\u2019d love to meet Jocko. That was a great talk. Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s incredible. He\u2019s an incredible human being. Tough young man, that Jocko. Well, Cal, this is always so much fun. Thank you for taking the time and I think I need to feed you more yerba mate, man. That was a hell of a tear. That was good. Cal Fussman: You know what people don\u2019t realize is we don\u2019t know if the last installment was affected by the last tea. This caramel tea that I didn\u2019t realize puts you away. Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ve been having tea and last night I was like, \u201cCal, you want some tea?\u201d He was like, sure. There was a big collection of tea and so after we did the evening, the p.m. session interview yesterday, Cal\u2019s like, \u201cI really like this tea.\u201d He pointed to the caramel bedtime tea which literally, in the past when I\u2019ve taken it, has made me feel like Leonardo DiCaprio at the payphone in Wolf of Wall Street. Cal Fussman: I remember that, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: I was like, Holy God, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even standing right now. I was very impressed you powered through that. So we\u2019ll focus on the South American stimulants, meaning yerba mate in the future, perhaps. But guys listening, we will have links to everything we can track down in the show notes. Of course, Cal\u2019s site and social and so on. Please say hi to him. Anything else to add before we sign off? Cal Fussman: The whole weekend has been an absolute delight. I come out of here almost a changed man. It sounds odd. We\u2019ve had about 36 hours of conversation and that part of you, that uplifting part of you, has taken me to places I\u2019m just starting, light bulbs are just starting to go off in my mind. So I can\u2019t wait to come back for the third, because I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to take me. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s just a joy to hang out with you, man. If I can, in my own meandering way, offer a few things from the path that I\u2019ve already traveled, then that makes my whole weekend. I always learn so much from you so I feel like very selfishly I\u2019m learning a lot more than I\u2019m giving out. Cal Fussman: I don\u2019t know about that. Tim Ferriss: But I am fixing your shoulder with the sauna. We have this barrel sauna which came from Specks, developed by Laird Hamilton and then I think either duplicated or refined by Rick Ruben when we actually recorded the interview in there and burned our hands on the mics. But so many adventures to have and we\u2019re just getting started. So everybody listening, you can find the show notes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast as always, for this episode and every other.

direct interaction with muhammad ali", "so i\u2019ll just pass it over to you for your thoughts", "for me, it was almost like having your childhood end when you\u2019re in your 50s \u2013 on the day that he died", "it\u2019s very hard to describe the feeling", "i hadn\u2019t ever really felt anything like it", "in fact, at a time where everybody was sitting down in front of the television looking for reports, i just curled up in bed", "i kind of knew the story", "i knew everything, so there was nothing more for me to learn", "i was just terrifically saddened because he was my childhood hero and there really are no longer many like him", "what made him unique", "and how did you grow to or get to know him", "i didn\u2019t meet him until 2003", "at that point, the world knew that he had parkinson\u2019s disease", "we had seen him at the olympics with the torch", "so let me back up to when i was a kid seeing him for the first time", "it\u2019s very hard for a lot of people to understand what the \u201860s were like if you didn\u2019t live through them", "because every day, you woke up and something else happened that made you go what", "what", "what", "whether it was, sadly, the shootings of dr", "martin luther king, jr", "or bobby kennedy, or it could have been woodstock, or landing on the moon", "every day seemed to bring something that you didn\u2019t expect", "ali was in the middle of it", "that\u2019s when he came of age", "he won the heavyweight championship in 1964", "so he kind of embodied, for me, the spirit of asking questions", "because at the time, he had won the olympic gold medal in 1960", "the story goes \u2013 we don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s true \u2013 that when he came back to louisville with his medal, he wasn\u2019t allowed into a restaurant and able to sit with white people", "so he took his gold medal and he threw it in the ohio river", "whether the story is true or not, it makes a point", "he was, in my mind, the voice of reason amidst what, at the time, was just crazy behavior", "it\u2019s hard to imagine that there were places where black people couldn\u2019t walk into and sit next to white people", "i\u2019m walking around now and i\u2019m just seeing in these days of black lives matter, just how integrated we are", "you go to an airport and there\u2019s no longer a thought about this", "but back then, that was the order of the day", "muhammad ali was somebody who stood up to that and let people know: hey, this is wrong", "and he did it in a way that made people laugh at times, through poetry; he was like the first rapper", "you could not take your eyes off him", "the other thing that\u2019s kind of interesting about it was there were only three networks that you could really watch in those days", "right, we were talking about that; it was kind of like bbc 1, 2, 3, and 4, in a sense", "right", "and if you have the camera on him, one of the most charismatic figures in the world, nobody else is going to compete with that", "so everybody was watching him", "it\u2019s not like now in the days of the internet and tmz, where he would have been followed relentlessly and every detail of his life would have been on the internet", "you only knew so much, but he was everywhere", "probably the most popular or the most well-known person in the world", "when the vietnam war really started to kick in and ali was inducted into the draft, the way he stood up to it and his famous line, \u201ci ain\u2019t got nothing against no vietcong", "it\u2019s just white people sending black people to kill yellow people.\u201d at the time, this sliced the country in half", "either you loved him for it or you hated him for it", "either you were with the kids out on the street who were protesting against the war or with the people who were beating them over the head", "very hard for somebody who\u2019s young now to understand that time", "we talk about the conventions that we\u2019re having this year", "people should go back and look at the 1968 democratic convention", "it was a free-for-all", "there was all kinds of violence outside of it", "and ali lived amidst this, and he was always, in my mind, asking the right questions", "why are we in vietnam", "why can\u2019t i sit next to somebody who has white skin in a restaurant", "it was very simple", "and then, there were so many people who hated him for asking those questions and for changing his name from cassius clay to muhammad ali", "he was really reviled by a huge number of people in this country", "for him to constantly stand up and risk going to jail for what he believed in, the faith that he had", "then it was backed up by his bravery in the ring when he fought with joe frazier and he fought with george foreman", "people thought he was going to get killed when he fought george foreman, who was undefeated and had knocked out just about everybody", "what about the incredible hulk", "i think it was in the warm-ups leading up to \u2013 am i getting this right", "it was in zaire", "i might be getting my locations mixed up", "i sometimes conflate the frazier and foreman fights", "but ali and others didn\u2019t want to watch foreman warming up on the heavy bag because it was just such a spectacle of force and impact", "yeah, you didn\u2019t want to believe that was coming in at you", "and yet, when they got into the ring to fight, ali basically laid back on the ropes and let foreman throw that at him, all the while saying, \u201cthat all you got, george", "that all you got?\u201d and a funny line by foreman was after four rounds, \u201cyeah, that\u2019s about it.\u201d and then by the eighth, ali hit him with a few straight punches and down he went; he was just exhausted", "but over again, we saw him take tremendous punishment and come back as he aged", "you just had a tremendous sense of belief when you followed him", "so for me, the idea that he was always asking these questions that were important to ask, that were the most important issues of the day, and then when he stood up to everything that was in front of him with full faith in himself, in my mind that was the definition of a hero", "in 2003, esquire magazine was celebrating its 70th anniversary", "it had always been my dream to do a magazine story about muhammad ali, from the time i was a kid", "so they sent me out to write this cover story based on reportage in dublin, ireland, where muhammad was in town for the special olympics", "he was going to help inaugurate the games", "so i went out there and it was one series of experiences after another that were completely surprising to me", "because do you know when you have a hero, you often don\u2019t want to meet them because they\u2019re your hero before you know who they really are", "right, and you might encounter the hero with clay feet", "exactly", "and suffer the disillusionment and disappointment", "yeah, and you don\u2019t want to walk away from your hero disappointed", "so i didn\u2019t know what was going to happen", "but keep in mind \u2013 we should cite this; this is seven years after 1996, the atlanta olympics \u2013 when he did something else that i thought was very brave", "because at that point, everyone knew he had parkinson\u2019s disease", "and he stood with the olympic torch in front of the world", "the torch is in his shaking hand", "he had to put it into the olympic cauldron to get it to light", "and for what seemed like an endless amount of time, he couldn\u2019t get it in the right place, and his hand is shaking, and it was like the world was holding its collective breath", "and all of a sudden, he got it in the right place", "the flame erupted, and so did everybody\u2019s heart", "and from that point on, \u201896 to 2003, we hadn\u2019t really seen that much about him", "so the editors basically said, \u201ctell us, how is he doing?\u201d so i go to the special olympics to meet him", "he\u2019s in a hotel, and he knows in advance that he\u2019s my childhood hero", "he comes through the double doors of his bedroom suite and he\u2019s walking kind of slowly, and i just put out my hand to shake his hand", "and he just threw out his arms and hugged me with a big embrace", "after that, he\u2019s moving on really slow, tender steps", "and then he kind of slumps down in this cushy leather chair", "i take the sofa on the side", "and i say to him, \u201cchamp, i came here to find out all the wisdom that you\u2019ve accumulated in the world.\u201d but he doesn\u2019t seem to be paying attention", "he seems to be paying attention to his right arm, which is trembling back and forth", "and now both of his arms are really starting to tremble", "and i\u2019m starting to think, what should i do", "should i call his wife", "and now, not only his arms are trembling but his torso, his legs are shaking, his breaths are coming almost in gasps", "and now i\u2019m really starting to get nervous", "i said, \u201cchamp, champ, are you okay?\u201d and then slowly, his head rises to the point where he is at eye level with me", "and he looks me in the eye and he says, \u201cscared ya, huh?\u201d and it only got more confusing", "it only got more confusing", "so the olympics get started, special olympics, and there was one moment when it really hit me", "like you asked why was he your hero", "muhammad is going to meet with nelson mandela", "muhammad\u2019s best friend and photographer, howard bingham, is with us, and muhammad\u2019s wife, and i\u2019m coming along", "we meet mandela, and we\u2019re walking to a hotel suite to sit down and talk", "and on the way, mandela is saying how when he was imprisoned in his younger days and he would hear news of muhammad ali, how much it inspired him", "and i\u2019m standing there looking at nelson mandela thinking: hold it; my hero is nelson mandela\u2019s hero", "and that\u2019s when it really hit me what muhammad ali meant to the world", "we had this nice meeting", "and then the olympics get started, and ali was there to go around the track in a golf cart and kind of wave to the crowd and just get everything started off on a really high note", "so i\u2019m down at the base of the stadium with him, and the golf cart comes out and muhammad slowly gets on; he gets into his seat", "howard, his best friend and photographer, gets on the back and he waves me \u2013 come on, get on, get on", "so i run and i hop on the golf cart and it was an amazing experience", "because you\u2019re driving around, and there\u2019s 80,000 people in croke park", "and wherever ali went was that same chant: ali, ali", "and it was almost like this energy is coming from the top of the stadium down on us", "then ali would put up his hand, and then the energy would get pushed back all the way to the top", "then it would come down again, and so back and forth and back and forth", "i was always the one at the top of the stadium screaming, so it was an amazing experience to see the power that he still had", "and yet, when we had to leave that day, he needed a wheelchair", "so it was like a mystery to me because he had all this power, and yet he was very vulnerable and his body was breaking down", "i was just trying to figure this out to write this story, to explain how is muhammad ali doing", "it was confounding to me", "because one day we would go out to dinner and after dinner, we\u2019re coming out of the restaurant and a huge throng of people is coming", "it\u2019s time to get in the car and go", "we just can\u2019t be avalanched like that", "he needs to move fast, and he does", "and then, the day after that, he can\u2019t speak much above a whisper at that time but he\u2019s doing magic tricks for people", "when we got back to his home in michigan, i remember he had just taken his medicine for parkinson\u2019s disease", "we\u2019re sitting on the couch", "the medicine turned his tongue orange", "we\u2019re talking and just all of a sudden he falls asleep, and his left leg is jangling into mine", "i\u2019m thinking, how can i possibly make sense of this", "i can\u2019t really describe these contradictions", "there\u2019s no question i can really ask that\u2019s going to unlock this mystery", "so i\u2019m getting down to the last day that i\u2019m scheduled to be with him", "and muhammad\u2019s wife, lonnie, says, \u201cyou know, you don\u2019t work out much anymore, muhammad", "why don\u2019t you just go with cal to the gym and just do a little workout?\u201d muhammad kind of rolls his eyes: oh, okay, come on", "so he takes me over to the gym on the property, and it\u2019s not really a gym; it\u2019s more like a museum", "we walk in and the ring looks like nobody\u2019s ever-stepped foot in it", "there\u2019s no smell of sweat", "there\u2019s exercise equipment all around the ring and it looks like it\u2019s just out of boxes", "all four walls have mirrors on them, and above the mirrors are photos, great photos, of ali fighting his archrival joe frazier", "there were other photos, too, but those were the ones that really stood out to me", "because the trilogy that they fought was like the thrill of my childhood", "it\u2019s what i lived for", "i knew everything about muhammad ali and joe frazier down to the childhood stories that define their styles in the ring", "like for instance, muhammad, when he was a kid, he would have his younger brother, rudy, pick up rocks in the street and throw the rocks at muhammad\u2019s head", "back then, he was cassius", "and as the rock would be approaching his head just about to hit, he would just throw his head back, lean away from it and let the rock slide by", "and that was exactly the style he adopted in the ring", "he would dance like no other heavyweight ever before him danced", "if you got close enough to throw a punch, he was just going to lean back, make you miss, and then he\u2019d hit you like 20 times, faster than a shoeshine guy could buff a pair of shoes", "joe frazier, on the other hand, very different story", "short, stocky, and here\u2019s where that left hook came from", "when he was a kid, he grew up on a farm in beaufort, south carolina", "his dad had only one arm", "nobody knows the real story, but apparently there had been trouble with some other woman, and some shooting, and so joe\u2019s dad only had one arm", "and they would work this cross saw back and forth, joe and his dad", "joe\u2019s dad would use his right arm, and joe would be using his left", "so he\u2019s just sawing back and forth for years with that left hand", "he had the muscles that are developing as he\u2019s going back and forth, back and forth", "the power that he developed in this left hand turned into this phenomenal left hook that came out of the side out of nowhere", "it was the only punch that a kid who could move away from rocks in the middle of the street was vulnerable to because you didn\u2019t see it coming", "all the times, except at the very end of his career that muhammad ali got knocked down, always with a left hook", "it was his kryptonite", "and here you\u2019ve got a guy who is like 5\u201910\u201d, 205 pounds of relentless kryptonite coming at him", "and when ali fought frazier, it was like thunder versus lightning", "the thing about it was, when they fought, ali had already refused to go into the army", "he was stripped of his heavyweight championship", "the government wouldn\u2019t let him fight", "the state commissions wouldn\u2019t let him fight for three and a half years", "he lost the prime of his career", "when he was finally able to come back in 1970, he wasn\u2019t as fast", "he couldn\u2019t dance the way he danced when he was 22 and 23", "at this point, he\u2019s 28, 29", "he\u2019d never had anybody like joe frazier coming at him before", "so you had on march 8, 1971, thunder versus lightning, never before seen: two undefeated legitimate heavyweight champions confronting each other", "frank sinatra, there was a photographer in the front row; everybody had to be ringside for this", "the whole world was watching", "it was like the sporting event of the century", "so what happened, what happened in the first fight anyway is ali started to get in trouble because joe frazier just would not stop", "the left hooks kept coming", "ali was able to get into the minds of a lot of his opponents", "he tried to get into the mind of joe frazier", "frazier would be hitting him with shots and ali would be saying to him, \u201cyou can\u2019t beat me, i\u2019m god!\u201d that would have worked on some other people", "joe frazier just looked at him and said, \u201cwell, god\u2019s gonna get his ass whooped tonight!\u201d he kept throwing punches", "and so when ali would get into trouble \u2013 and frazier got him into trouble \u2013 he had this corner man named drew bundini brown, who was the guy who, when you hear the phrase \u201cfloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee,\u201d that came from both muhammad and bundini", "they would kind of sing it, \u201cfloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee; rumble, young man, rumble!\u201d so when ali got in trouble, bundini would, in the most poetic ways, say things to help lift him up, anything", "\u201cthe world needs you, champ!\u201d \u201cgo to the well once more", "go to the well once more!\u201d almost always, ali would reach inside of him, find whatever was deep in the well, and use it to lift him over the bar", "so i\u2019m looking at these pictures above the mirrors on the wall, and i\u2019m almost hearing bundini\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cgo to the well once more!\u201d and i realized that\u2019s what i\u2019ve got to do", "that is my question, here", "in order to write this piece, i\u2019ve got to find out what\u2019s still in the well", "so i look around the gym and there is a rack of boxing gloves", "and i\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cyou think you should take the risk?\u201d i don\u2019t know", "then i said, \u201cwhat the hell, let me try it.\u201d because one of the things that i\u2019ve learned as an interviewer is when you get to the end of an interview, that\u2019s when you can always ask the toughest question", "so i take four gloves off this rack and i put two on muhammad\u2019s hands and two on mine", "now, actually if people heard the first \u2013 installation of our conversation", "yeah", "then they know about the story of me fighting against julio c\u00e9sar ch\u00e1vez", "which begins \u2013 just as a side note \u2013 with you sitting on the couch eating potato chips berating julio c\u00e9sar ch\u00e1vez on tv and your wife saying something along the lines of, \u201coh, yeah, okay", "you\u2019re going to fight julio c\u00e9sar ch\u00e1vez?\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201cdamn right i\u2019m gonna fight julio c\u00e9sar ch\u00e1vez.\u201d and long story short, because you should listen to the long version, you ended up traveling by hook and crook and donkey and everything else to make it happen", "yes, we did", "but you did a lot of serious boxing training", "and that\u2019s the whole point, here", "when i trained, i trained for six months to get in the ring for one round with julio c\u00e9sar ch\u00e1vez", "and i trained in the exact style of joe frazier", "i could do joe frazier so well, i could even sound like joe frazier", "so i\u2019ve got these gloves on, he\u2019s got the gloves on, but i don\u2019t come at him", "i don\u2019t ask to go to the ring", "i just start to move toward the heavy bag", "smokin\u2019 joe had this style where he\u2019s like bobbing back and forth, his head moving left to right, and his left hand would be doing like a figure eight in front of his head and his right hand would be figure eighting in front of his jaw", "and he\u2019s going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth", "he\u2019s low, and he\u2019s in a crouch and he\u2019s just relentlessly pursuing", "then he\u2019d get close with the left hand saying, \u201chit me ta, hit me ta.\u201d he\u2019d be throwing that left hook", "so i\u2019m in that crouch, i\u2019m bobbing and weaving", "i\u2019m looking at ali out of the corner of my eyes to see what kind of reaction i\u2019m going to get", "it was like watching his eyebrows arch", "it was like watching a sleeping lion awakened by an old, familiar scent", "he looks over and he says, \u201cyou good!\u201d i hear that and now i\u2019m starting to hit into the bag saying, \u201chit me ta, hit me ta!\u201d i\u2019m throwing my left hooks right at it: hit me ta, hit me ta", "ali steps up", "and he\u2019s throwing left, right, left, right, left right", "i said, \u201cyou think that\u2019s gonna keep me off?\u201d now i\u2019m really in a crouch", "hit me ta, hit me ta, hit me ta", "he steps in, lefts and rights, lefts and rights, jab, jab, jab, lefts and rights", "i come back, and all of a sudden he looks at me in a way that says: \u201cokay", "so that\u2019s your question.\u201d slowly, with his left hand, he waves me away from the bag, and he waits until i\u2019m away from the bag", "then i saw something i never thought i would ever see again", "muhammad ali started dancing", "he\u2019s dancing around the bag", "he\u2019s moving not like when he was 20, but he still had the rhythm, he still had the grace", "he\u2019s moving around the bag, and he\u2019s looking at himself in the mirror", "as he\u2019s looking at himself, you could see his chest come up", "then his head came up, and he\u2019s dancing, and he\u2019s dancing", "then all of a sudden, he stops, pivots, and there were like 40 straight shots right into the bag, really rapid fire", "i\u2019m in disbelief", "his last shot, if the bag had been a heavyweight fighter, he might have knocked him down", "i\u2019m standing there just staring, don\u2019t know what to say", "it\u2019s hard to process what i\u2019ve just seen", "you\u2019re thinking, no one is going to believe me", "yeah", "what", "as he\u2019s going away from the bag, his legs cross and he starts to go down", "i\u2019m going: no, no, this is not happening", "no, please", "and now he\u2019s going down, down, down and there are mats on the ground, and he falls on the mats", "now i\u2019m thinking, \u201cwhat did you do, cal", "oh, you idiot", "why did you do that?\u201d i\u2019m paralyzed for a second but then i start to move over to help him get up", "before i can reach him, he flips over and he starts doing stomach crunches", "then he\u2019s doing sit-ups", "then he\u2019s on his back, legs bicycling in the air", "then he gets up and he goes over to super leg press", "it\u2019s on like 250 pounds", "he grips it, pushing it back and forth", "i said, \u201cchamp, you don\u2019t have to do this", "i seen you, champ", "i seen you", "don\u2019t worry about it", "i know what\u2019s in the well.\u201d and he just looked at me and he said, \u201cfeels good.\u201d and i thought i had pushed him as far as i could, but he had more to give", "so after this, we go back to the house and he knew that i wanted his wisdom", "he tells me to sit down at a table outside the kitchen", "i\u2019m sitting down, and he comes to me with a piece of paper", "on this paper, it\u2019s just filled with wisdom", "i\u2019m going down the lines, one after the other, and he points to one in the middle", "it says, \u201cgod will not place a burden on a man\u2019s shoulder knowing that he cannot handle it.\u201d and that kind of summed everything up", "but for me, the story went a little further", "because he went into the kitchen, and he came out with two bowls in his left hand and a quart of ice cream in his right", "you know how much i love ice cream, tim", "so i got a chance to sit at a table and have ice cream with my childhood hero", "that is my enduring memory", "it was just sad to in one minute know that this man who had been with me all my life was not with us anymore", "the thing that really pushed me, because i was called by the editor of esquire because the magazine was shipping out on the exact day that muhammad died", "so he wanted to hold off the issue and make sure that we represented", "esquire had followed ali\u2019s career like just about no other magazine; maybe sports illustrated can make the same claim", "so i\u2019m sitting there charged with writing this essay of what he meant to me", "what really hit me was when i started to think forward", "i started to think of all of the kids now", "i\u2019m wondering, what kind of heroes do they have", "do they have a muhammad ali", "i don\u2019t think so", "the reason i don\u2019t think so is because we don\u2019t have a nelson mandela who saw muhammad ali as a hero", "it\u2019s just a completely different time", "i wondered what this absence might mean for this next generation going forward", "who are their heroes", "what are they going to get out of it", "it really has pushed me to think, and to think a lot about this millennial generation, which we were laughing about yesterday because everybody says the word \u201cmillennial.\u201d i tried to look it up", "i was like, we need to sort this out", "we were at dinner having some wine", "and the first article that pops up says, \u201ceveryone can agree that millennials are the worst.\u201d and the next line was something along the lines of, \u201cbut no one can seem to define what exactly a millennial is.\u201d well, there you go", "the amazing thing to me, for some reason \u2013 i don\u2019t know what it is, and i think you have the same characteristic \u2013 certainly you do", "i\u2019m just starting to see little vibrations of it", "where there\u2019s an attraction among the millennials to you", "i know that because they all come over to me and say, \u201coh, i heard the podcast that you did with tim ferris.\u201d so there\u2019s like this whole arc of millennials out there that i know are listening to you", "they\u2019re also starting to come up to me", "i really feel for this generation", "i feel for them because i don\u2019t think they have a muhammad ali", "a lot of them were behind bernie sanders", "to me, i love seeing bernie out there pounding on the podium", "he\u2019s in his mid-70s and he\u2019s throwing himself into it, and it looked like what could be better than that", "you\u2019re that age and you\u2019re throwing your entire passion into your every day", "you can\u2019t beat that", "but to me, there\u2019s a difference between having muhammad ali as a hero and to having bernie sanders as a hero", "maybe i\u2019m wrong, maybe people will \u2013 well, i think there\u2019s a difference in stakes, right", "and i think that \u2013 who was it", "cus d\u2019amato", "i want to say it was cus d\u2019amato, the famous trainer of mike tyson starting in the catskill days, who said, \u201cthe hero and the coward feel the same thing", "the difference is how the hero responds.\u201d and i\u2019m paraphrasing, of course", "but the fact of the matter is if \u2013 and i\u2019m sure some people will disagree on some level \u2013 but the stakes of engaging in the theater of politics for an election are very different from going up against the norms and laws of your country", "the stakes are just different", "so you have someone who has put their livelihood where their mouth is, and reputation where their mouth, is to make sacrifices", "i think that engenders a certain type of loyalty and respect that is very hard to mimic in the sort of charade of politics as we see a lot of it play out", "but i would say that if there is a problem related to heroes among younger generations right now, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s because there is a lack of heroes", "i think it\u2019s because there is so much noise that one needs to sift through to find the signal that is a hero they can believe in", "if that makes any sense", "instead of having four channels, you have an infinite number of channels in the form of websites and feeds and apps and push notifications, and so on", "so it becomes more of a sort of cognitive burden and time-consuming task to find someone that one can dedicate their admiration to", "does that make any sense", "there are a few exceptions, though", "i would say that, as you said, we didn\u2019t have all of the details when he was the greatest", "much like all of this sort of came up at the time, for the nature of dr", "martin luther king jr", "\u2013 the adultery", "people are flawed human beings; they make mistakes", "they make bad decisions", "but in today\u2019s environment, that gets showcased and put into a permanent record that comes up as a top five google result for your name", "so i think it\u2019s more challenging to have heroes now because they are more clearly human as a result of the abundance of information available", "but i do think there are some out there", "elon musk i think is very inspiring, has made great decisions, has all of the flaws that human beings do, of course", "but i\u2019m cautiously optimistic", "i think that there are very few muhammad alis, period, in the world", "well, yeah", "what i realized is a lot of this is the time, as you\u2019re saying", "because when you look at what elon musk is doing and the grandiosity of his vision, and then also to have failed, failed, and then put the craft in the air", "so you see, yeah, this is a big timer", "and yet, if you were in south dakota at a movie theater and elon musk was ten people in front of you in line to get in, how many people would know who he was", "i see where you\u2019re going", "he is sort of unassuming compared to a heavyweight champion of the world, right", "yeah, but to my mind when you think of a hero \u2013 this is what i\u2019m trying to grapple with, this question", "has the hero changed now so that elon musk is the hero now", "but to think of him in the way i think of ali is just foolish because everything\u2019s changed", "it\u2019s entirely possible", "i want to actually ask a couple of questions that were sitting on my mind during your story", "the first is, do you remember the flavor of ice cream that you had", "vanilla", "vanilla", "just straight vanilla", "straight vanilla", "no decoration on the vanilla", "no, just vanilla ice cream", "how did you end up opening and/or closing the piece that you wrote, if you remember", "it\u2019s interesting because one of the difficulties that you have \u2013 and this always happens", "you\u2019re a writer and they say okay, you\u2019ve got 1,500 words", "then you start writing, and then there are 2,500 words on your page and you know that only 1,500 are going to fit in the magazine", "they basically pull this thing away from the presses, and there are a certain amount of pages and so there\u2019s no extra room for you", "the editor said, \u201cthis is what i can give you.\u201d he\u2019s giving you an opportunity to make the most out of it", "of course you want to make it even better than that, somehow", "so you go overboard and you write a thousand extra words", "then you have to look at it, have an editor look at it, and then say okay, what\u2019s the 1,500 words that we really want here", "the interesting thing about this piece was exactly what i was just talking about", "there was everything that i had seen in the past, and then there were these questions of where does this put the future", "but at the time, it really was an obituary and so it really was a look back", "so the thousand words that got cut were the thousand words that were looking ahead", "and it basically ended with this point that you just were never going to see this again, ever", "it\u2019s passed", "we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going", "maybe it is going to the elon musks of the world and people will just have a different definition than i did", "it\u2019s possible", "or if you look at just a broader time scale, right", "i mean how many genghis khans are running around", "not that many", "and if you look at it in a broader, 1,000 year increment, maybe we\u2019re just in a lull period between heroes", "that\u2019s an interesting point", "i guess we\u2019re accustomed to \u2013 we want heroes", "we need heroes", "i think human beings need heroes", "i think we\u2019re hardwired to search for heroes", "we find them in real life, we find them in mythology, we find them in religion, or we find them somewhere else", "i think we are by nature very hierarchical animals", "there\u2019s a very interesting book called chimpanzee politics for people who are very interested in looking at the reality of our evolutionary biology", "i think we look for rulers and heroes, and it\u2019s an important signpost for the mammals we\u2019ve evolved to be", "do you recall any of the other pieces of wisdom on that paper", "there were a lot that ran in this \u201cwhat i\u2019ve learned\u201d that i really like", "my favorite was \u201cthe best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.\u201d that was a good one", "\u201csilence is golden when you can\u2019t think of a good answer.\u201d \u201cthe sun is always shining someplace.\u201d i remember asking him about his definition of evil", "and he said, \u201cunfriendliness.\u201d i thought that was a really good answer", "\u201cthe more we help others, the more we help ourselves.\u201d \u201cwhat you\u2019re thinking about you are becoming.\u201d oh, how about this for a kicker", "\u201cwhen you\u2019re right, nobody remembers", "when you\u2019re wrong, nobody forgets.\u201d dot, dot, dot; especially with the internet", "looking back, i think it captured the experience that i spent with him", "so there were two stories", "one was the cover story that came out on the 70th anniversary of esquire in 2003", "then in january of \u201804, the \u201cwhat i\u2019ve learned\u201d came out", "i think both stories captured the essence of what i wanted to bring out", "on top of that, i should point out for me, the best part of the experience was spending a week with my childhood hero", "and at the end of it liking him even more than i did before i met him", "he was even more heroic to me for that reason, once i knew him", "just seeing the kindness", "there was this great obit in time magazine written by a guy named bob lipsyte, who was a new york times columnist for many years and spent 50 years with ali", "they did a book in time magazine that was filled with lipsyte\u2019s story and photos", "the story starts in an interesting way", "he and ali are going through an airport", "they\u2019re late for the plane and lipsyte doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re going to make it", "as they\u2019re moving through the airport, a woman appears and notices ali and pulls out her camera to get a picture", "ali stops, goes over to the woman, and makes sure that she has the picture that she wants", "lipsyte is thinking, \u201clook, the plane\u2019s going to leave.\u201d ali said to him, \u201cthat was the only time that woman was going to have a chance to have her picture taken with me", "i wanted to make sure she got the best picture.\u201d i don\u2019t know that there are many people who are thinking that way", "obviously, part of it gave him internal satisfaction, but he really was thinking a lot about everyone around him", "who are other people, heroes or just well-known folks who have exceeded your expectations", "i have breakfast every morning with larry king, and so i see him when we\u2019re in town together at the same time probably 300 days a year", "if you\u2019re an interviewer, it\u2019s very likely you\u2019re going to really look up to him", "i\u2019ve formed a very close friendship with him and that\u2019s something i never could have anticipated", "it\u2019s beyond what he accomplished in a career; now it\u2019s about friendship", "so it has gone way beyond that sense of a hero from afar", "in fact, i helped him write a book and he inscribed it to me saying, \u201cto cal, my friend, my writer, my hero.\u201d when your hero calls you \u2013 he was joking, but still he wrote it on the page", "it\u2019s still on the page", "it\u2019s still on the page; it still counts", "but that\u2019s emblematic that he would write that to me", "it tells you about him", "it tells you about the kindness and the friendship underneath it", "so that\u2019s probably my best answer to the question", "i have some requests from fans, or i should say listeners, who had a lot of follow up questions for you and of course we\u2019ll have to pick and choose", "but this is from ozro hepworth: ask him if he\u2019ll talk about the time in brazil he used a camera under his shirt as a fake gun to scare off some guys", "is that a real thing", "how did he know", "he said, \u201ci heard the story from someone who knows him pretty well", "i would love to hear about it via cal fussman storytelling style.\u201d oh, man", "wow", "let\u2019s see", "my fans are everywhere, man", "eyes and ears in all corners", "you know what", "that\u2019s pretty impressive", "okay", "this is early, i believe, 1994, february carnival, rio de janeiro", "carnevale", "my wife is brazilian", "i met her headed to a beach near the equator eight years before this carnival", "the bus story that we talked about in part one", "right", "and so we get a chance to go back to carnival where we\u2019re going to dance in the samba parade and spangles and feathers at 3:00 in the morning in front of the huge crowds", "it\u2019s like a fantasy", "custom thong for yourself, i\u2019m assuming", "when you join a samba school \u2013 they call them samba schools \u2013 various neighborhoods all band together and they compete against each other", "so when an outsider comes in, you go to one of the samba schools and you wear their regalia", "but it\u2019s all spangles and feathers no matter what", "when it comes to the beautiful women, there\u2019s not too many spangles and feathers to be seen; it\u2019s just the beautiful women", "this is a wonderful experience", "my wife couldn\u2019t resist", "she always wanted to dance in the samba school", "she was five months pregnant at the time so it was probably not the best of times for her to be flying halfway around the world and dancing at 3:00 in the morning", "up on some float potentially, who knows", "yeah, we weren\u2019t on a float", "we were following the floats", "we had a great time; it was a blast", "the thing about the way i traveled was i always liked to live with the people", "so the people that brought us into this samba school lived in a favela, which is in the mountains overlooking the city", "very poor, typically; cobbled together electricity, oftentimes", "if you haven\u2019t seen the city of god, ciudad de dios, i think it is, check it out", "that will give you a pretty good glimpse", "some of the favelas are actually decent places to live", "it\u2019s not all like you\u2019re living on a dirt floor", "people figure out how to cobble electricity", "this area wasn\u2019t an intensely poor area, but it\u2019s dangerous to be moving around on the streets", "but look, we were in a group of people from this area", "i felt completely safe because when you\u2019re with the people, you\u2019re with the people", "safety in numbers with the locals", "the locals, exactly", "so we go through the dance, it\u2019s a really great time; the music, the crowd, the sheer pageantry of the whole thing", "we\u2019re starting to walk back home; it\u2019s like 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning", "now, right around that time we had heard of \u2013 i hope i\u2019m pronouncing it right; it\u2019s been awhile now", "but the word was \u201cahasdao.\u201d which was \u2013 what would happen is there are a lot of bridges in rio that people can walk over", "what young toughs and thugs would do is they would line both sides of the bridge and just be like looking over the water casually and waiting for an appropriate moment where everybody would just attack somebody or a group of people, to either steal something or you can get beat up", "stuff that wasn\u2019t so good is going to happen to you", "we\u2019d heard about this", "we knew it was kind of a dangerous time and we were staying in a place that while it was not dangerous on that street, we were still walking through dangerous places to get there", "so it\u2019s really early in the morning, and we\u2019re walking across this bridge", "my wife is brazilian, and she looks brazilian", "i do not look brazilian; i\u2019m like a gringo", "it\u2019s the middle of february and at that point, i\u2019m back in new york", "it\u2019s winter and i\u2019m looking really white", "ghostly", "i wouldn\u2019t say ghostly", "come on, tim, give me a break", "just trying to expand my adjectives; sorry", "i know that, okay, if they\u2019re going to be looking to get somebody, they\u2019re coming after me", "so we\u2019re all walking and now i\u2019m seeing these lines of people on the side, and i can see that they\u2019re looking over at us", "i immediately know this is not good", "because we\u2019re in the middle of a fairly long bridge and we\u2019ve got like a half a mile to get to the other side where at least you could run or do something", "there\u2019s nowhere for us to go except over the side and take a long tumble into the water", "it\u2019s like an indiana jones and the temple of doom situation", "it was really scary", "it\u2019s interesting because when i think back on it, i have some measure of pride because there are just certain moments where you know, okay, bad shit\u2019s gonna happen", "what am i going to do", "you have no time to think", "so i immediately say to my wife, who really understands what\u2019s going to happen even far better to me", "i say, \u201cyou stay toward the middle but get away from me,\u201d because i know they\u2019re coming after me", "i don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen", "i may get thrown off the side, i may get pummeled; who was to know", "but i\u2019m just thinking if i could have them all turn on me, then my wife and my kid are going to be able to get away", "so i move away and she is really nervous", "i just said, \u201cwalk as fast as you can to get to the other side.\u201d i\u2019m going to slow it down and have their focus on me", "in the meantime, one of the guys that was in our neighborhood, toco \u2013 god bless him \u2013 he has stopped to take a piss under the bridge", "this piss saved my life", "because what happened was, after he was done he came back up to the bridge and then he saw from behind what was going to happen", "and he just came running, shouted to a few people and went running, and literally as everybody was about to turn on me \u2013 and the other thing about it i should point out, this is right after i fought julio c\u00e9sar ch\u00e1vez", "so i\u2019m also in the back of my mind saying the first guy, i can hit him", "maybe if he goes down, maybe it\u2019ll stop things for a second", "or maybe they\u2019re all just going to mow me down", "but there were a lot of men looking, and they\u2019re coming after me", "no shortage of firearms in brazil, either", "you know what", "i don\u2019t even think it was a matter of that because the setup was you didn\u2019t need it", "all you had to do was just get 50 people to line up the side of a bridge and then wait for a moment of attack, and then attack", "a gringo tourist dressed in spangles and feathers, what\u2019s he gonna do", "i\u2019m sorry", "just the sheer shock of some gringo in spangles and feathers knocking out the first guy would have been quite something", "but please continue", "okay", "so at this point, there\u2019s two thoughts", "the first thought is, this could be it for me, but at least my wife and my son get out of here", "so now i\u2019ve slowed it down", "i\u2019m seeing she\u2019s moving really fast away", "okay, now i\u2019m waiting for the onslaught", "now, in the meantime, toco sees what\u2019s going on, calls a few of his friends and he just sprints with his hand inside his shirt", "he and his buddies, they literally surround me and they just stop the group", "he\u2019s a guy who\u2019s looking like he\u2019s al capone, like hey, i\u2019ve got some serious firepower here", "i\u2019m going to mow you all down if you don\u2019t leave him alone", "he\u2019s with us", "then there\u2019s this fear among the crowd because we don\u2019t know what toco\u2019s got under there", "who knows", "but he\u2019s got something", "toco says, \u201cjust back off, let us get to the other side of the bridge, we\u2019re not going to have any problems", "otherwise, there\u2019s going to be a lot of problems.\u201d and these guys, just everybody\u2019s staring at what\u2019s inside toco\u2019s shirt", "and so the others just remained still while i get to the other side", "i\u2019m walking straight but toco and the others are walking backward, making sure nobody\u2019s \u2013 with his hand in his shirt the whole time", "we get to the other side and i said, \u201cman, i didn\u2019t know you took a gun.\u201d and he pulled out a camera", "man, what a bluff", "yeah", "i owe my life to him and that quick bathroom stop and the camera", "how did these people hear this story", "i have no idea", "you can ask ozro, @ozrohepworth can tell you more", "you might be listening, ozro, so let cal know", "one more and then perhaps we\u2019ll have to be continued", "it\u2019s from a friend of mine, actually, a chef", "\u201cask about his acceptance speech for the jbf.\u201d james beard foundation", "that was something i didn\u2019t expect", "man, it\u2019s amazing", "it\u2019s like the oscars for food", "yeah, it\u2019s like the oscars for food and it was in a beautiful setting with thousands of people in new york", "the thing about the james beard award is there are a lot of awards given out during these ceremonies", "in the beginning people are paying attention, but then you get everybody coming up and you\u2019re warned", "you\u2019ve got three minutes", "you win an award, like no more than 180 seconds up behind the mic", "everybody knows there are a lot of awards and if people talk for 20 minutes, you\u2019re not going to get out of there until 4:00 in the morning", "so you\u2019re told: three minutes, that\u2019s it", "as the evening is going and more and more awards, and people are going up and i don\u2019t want to make fun of it but when you get people getting up and saying i\u2019d really like to thank aunt penelope for showing me how to skin a cucumber", "like it\u2019s over and over and over again", "a thousand variations of aunt penelope", "yeah, exactly", "and so naturally, the crowd\u2019s attention is going to start to drift away", "then once it starts to drift, it\u2019s just not coming back", "unless ted allen gets an award, a well-known tv personality, people will: oh, there\u2019s ted allen, and there will be a silence", "but if you\u2019re going through categories where only a few people know the person who has just won, the thing is just going on and on and on and now the whole crowd is having a good time at their table", "everybody\u2019s talking and having a great time but nobody\u2019s paying attention to aunt penelope no more", "so here it is, i\u2019ve just written this story that took me ten years to write about being the sommelier at windows in the world at the top of the world trade center just before the planes hit and the twin towers go down", "it takes me ten years to be able to write this story; i was so traumatized", "and i win the award for best essay", "the award is called, i hear my name, and i go up to the stage to give my speech", "and i look out and nobody is paying attention", "there must be like three or four thousand people there in this grand setting; nobody", "having a thousand conversations", "that\u2019s right", "i cannot describe all of the pain that i had to go through to get this piece out of me", "and here i am, you get your medal and then you\u2019re going up to speak", "i\u2019m looking out at this crowd and i can\u2019t speak out into that crowd because i feel like i\u2019ve got something important to say that goes back to 9/11, and there\u2019s nobody out there listening that i can see", "so i just get behind the podium and i don\u2019t say anything", "15 seconds pass, 30 seconds pass", "there\u2019s a woman over on the side, the one who\u2019s saying, \u201cthree minutes, three minutes.\u201d i\u2019ve just gone like 30 seconds and i haven\u2019t said a word", "45 seconds, a minute", "now you can start to see some people are saying what\u2019s going on", "why isn\u2019t he talking about his aunt penelope", "then, after it must have been a minute, maybe a minute and a half, ted allen stands up and in the crowd, throws his arm up like no", "like, cal must speak", "he didn\u2019t say that but something like that", "a hush comes over the crowd, and still i said i am not going to say a word until there is complete silence in this place", "and i just wait, and i wait and my three minutes is all up", "now there are people all around with their arms up saying, \u201clet him speak", "let him speak!\u201d then i spoke", "the beauty of the experience \u2013 because i\u2019m only now understanding that speaking was something that i was born to do", "when i look back on those moments, like that moment tells me yeah, you were born to do this", "because afterward, a chef like paul bartolotta, who has a great italian restaurant, had it at the win for many years, has won james beard awards for himself, came over to me and he just said, \u201cyou took back the crowd.\u201d at the time, i didn\u2019t understand it", "but now that i\u2019m starting to give speeches, now it makes sense", "yeah, i do have this and i have to use it", "it would be terrible for me not to use it", "i\u2019m supposed to use it", "but that was only like a flicker, and it was about five years after that before i started talking, but it was there", "some more questions when we get back from festivities", "a hundred percent", "you know, we could spend all tomorrow talking if you want", "i\u2019ve got this guy who\u2019s managing me now, kevin the manager", "and he says, \u201ccal, you go on and you do these three and a half hour podcasts, like three and a half hours", "do you realize how long that is?\u201d and then i said to him, \u201ckevin, it was fun", "why wouldn\u2019t i?\u201d so we can talk all tomorrow", "alright, fantastic", "[inaudible] barrel sauna use, which i\u2019ll fill people in on, perhaps", "one of my newest distractions/saviors but to be continued", "this is great fun and we will continue", "all right", "this is round two picking up in the a.m", "we have two mugs full of yerba mate tea and i thought we would tackle some questions from listeners", "one we can start with is nick styman: which interview in his career went worst", "discuss the aftermath", "okay, there\u2019s a good story to that one", "i don\u2019t know if many people remember a guy named william buckley", "he was an incredible intellect who was at the foundation of the conservative party", "but he had a tv show back in the \u201860s that was just fantastic", "this guy had an amazing intellect and a vocabulary that you\u2019d only dream of", "i don\u2019t know why but he was the only person i have ever been frightened to interview", "just because \u2013 well, i\u2019ll tell you why", "back in the \u201860s, he challenged robert kennedy to a debate on tv on his show", "robert kennedy wouldn\u2019t go", "so buckley comes on the next show and he spoke in this kind of effete way, and he basically says, \u201cwell, you know, i invited robert kennedy to come and debate me", "he has refused", "this is clearly a case of the baloney rejecting the grinder.\u201d what a line, wow", "he was like that all the time", "he could take you apart if he wanted to just with the magnificence of his language", "and i don\u2019t know what it was but i was really scared", "look, the guy was way older than me", "he had seen much more than me", "how old were you at the time", "just roughly", "oh, let\u2019s see", "probably late 30s, early 40s", "so not totally green", "no, that\u2019s the point", "that\u2019s the point", "i had no reason to fear him", "i\u2019d already done many \u201cwhat i\u2019ve learned\u201d interviews", "i\u2019d already met a lot of famous people, people who had done big things", "but i was just scared", "so i said to myself, you\u2019ve really got to be prepared for this interview like no other interview before", "and so i did all my research", "i read and read and read, and i watched what i could of him", "for two days before the interview, i stopped eating", "was this part of your performance enhancement plan or was that just nerves", "i just wanted to be laser focused when i walked in there", "like a hawk", "that\u2019s right", "or hunting like a peregrine falcon; they\u2019ll starve to make their senses more acute, okay", "that\u2019s exactly it", "i wanted my senses to be laser focused when i walked in there", "there was no way that this guy \u2013 food was going to throw you off", "i\u2019m outside of his apartment in new york like a half an hour early", "i\u2019m just pacing back and forth", "i\u2019m like, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to take you apart", "you\u2019re gonna stay with him, cal", "this guy is amazing but you\u2019re going to stay with him", "finally, the appointed hour arrives", "it\u2019s like 11:00 in the morning", "i go and i knock on his door", "the door swings open, and he throws his arms out wide and he says, \u201cwelcome to my home.\u201d and then he starts rubbing his hands together and he says, with a big smile on his face, \u201ca little scotch?\u201d now i\u2019m screwed", "now i\u2019m screwed because when i traveled around the world, if you offered me something to eat or something to drink, i drank it or i ate it", "i did some crazy stuff", "i remember going to the nile for the first time and just walking up and drinking out of it just to say, okay, i\u2019m at one with you here", "and the next three days, i couldn\u2019t leave my hotel room; i was over the toilet", "but that was my mentality", "if you serve it, i have ultimate respect", "i will eat it or drink it", "so now he\u2019s saying, \u201chave this scotch.\u201d i know if i put this scotch to my lips, within 20 minutes i\u2019m going to be slurring my words or out of it because i\u2019m just too clean for it", "so i looked at him, and i said \u2013 god, i regret it", "it gives me shivers just to repeat it", "i said, \u201chow about a little water?\u201d and he looks at me and his nose goes up in the air and he says, \u201coh.\u201d and in that \u201coh\u201d was, \u201cit\u2019s going to be that kind of interview, is it?\u201d and the interview was done", "it was just \u2013 i had not respected him", "look, my whole way of interviewing is i\u2019m going to make you feel like you\u2019re at home", "so here\u2019s a guy who opened the door to his home, threw out his arms to embrace me, offered me \u2013 who knows \u2013 probably a 50-year-old single malt and i just said no", "i couldn\u2019t even make him feel at home in his home", "we sit down and in fairness to myself, when i went back and listened to the interview, it wasn\u2019t that bad", "but it could have been great", "right, you know how much better it could have been", "yeah", "because i just set it off on such a wrong note, and it ended way earlier than it should have ended", "i walked away saying, you will never, ever do that again", "that is a mistake you never should have made and i hope you learned your lesson", "so what happened in the aftermath is a good part of that question", "because okay, i\u2019m getting ready to hand the piece in and i\u2019m just making it work", "it\u2019s one of those, if you\u2019re a pole-vaulter and you\u2019re just getting over the bar", "just barely clearing it", "yeah, and it\u2019s like shaking", "like you\u2019ve nicked it and it\u2019s shaking", "but i feel, as i\u2019m about to hand it in, that it\u2019s still there and i\u2019m coming down and i\u2019m going to have a soft landing here", "so phew", "and i get a phone call, and it\u2019s bad news, cal, bad news", "it\u2019s from the editor", "what\u2019s going on", "well, william buckley had written a piece for esquire like 30 or 40 years ago", "there were some problems with it and a legal agreement was made between william buckley and esquire that piece would never again run; it would never be republished", "and esquire had just put out a huge book of great stories", "oh, including his piece", "because what happened was there had been maybe eight editors in between the time that happened", "too many regime changes", "yeah, and nobody knew about this", "only buckley and his lawyers knew and they basically said, \u201chey, get that book off the racks", "you can\u2019t do this.\u201d so they said there\u2019s just no way we can run the interview", "i got a reprieve", "you got a reprieve and a pardon at the last minute", "that\u2019s right", "i got a last minute pardon", "the lesson was the truly important thing because i will never, ever go into an interview nervous because it serves no purpose", "it only hurts you", "were there points in the future when you felt the involuntary nerves kicking in and if so, what would you say to yourself", "no, because the experience scarred me", "remember the scotch", "now, i\u2019ll take ice cream into interviews", "so you skipped the peregrine falcon prep after that", "look, do the prep", "not the prep, but the fasting approach", "yeah, i mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous", "because if you\u2019re going intense, you\u2019re going to transmit that tenseness into the interview, into the person, into the subject", "look, there are a lot of interviewers who do things different ways", "i just did a piece with jorge ramos, the univision anchor who donald trump pitched out of the interview in iowa awhile back", "he has a completely different approach", "he goes into the interview as if it\u2019s a war", "because a lot of the people that he\u2019s interviewing could have been dictators, or presidents who took power in unscrupulous ways", "he knows he may only have a few minutes and he may be getting thrown out", "so he\u2019s going to come at them with the toughest questions right from the start", "biggest left hook, right at the bell of the first round", "that\u2019s right", "and he\u2019s had a great career out of it", "but look, his background was completely different from mine because he grew up in mexico where basically the media was censored, so he was a reaction to that", "everything he does is a reaction to censorship", "it\u2019s a reaction to people having power and taking advantage of those who don\u2019t have it", "he sees journalism as more than just asking a question", "he sees it as defending people", "i really don\u2019t go into an interview to defend anybody", "in fact, it\u2019s kind of interesting because some people say, what happens when you get people who lie to you", "i say, the way i write, it\u2019s impossible for somebody to lie to me because i write in other people\u2019s words", "so if they lie to me, their lie is going to be printed on the page exactly the way they told it", "so basically, the truth is, they\u2019re a liar", "because anybody who knows the truth is going to know that they lied", "so very, very different styles", "very different styles", "we were talking yesterday about some prep that i was doing for an interview where i wanted to watch a movie", "we ended up watching a good part of it together", "but i was nervous that i wouldn\u2019t have the chance to see it beforehand, due to some technological issues", "you mentioned that, for instance, larry king doesn\u2019t want to know anything about \u2013 and feel free to add to this \u2013 say, a given movie that\u2019s coming out that a guest is a part of because he wants to, i suppose, see it with fresh eyes and ask the questions that a beginner might ask, or someone who\u2019s unfamiliar with it", "how does your style differ from, say, larry\u2019s", "of course, you spend a lot of time with larry", "yeah", "larry\u2019s basic idea is, i am thinking like the person who\u2019s listening", "they haven\u2019t seen the movie", "they haven\u2019t gotten a chance to get a preview so why should i, larry king, be in the position to tell them what happens", "better for him to put \u2013 oh, there\u2019s molly", "molly\u2019s awake now, guys", "she was sedated yesterday but she\u2019s full of beans today", "i will close that door if she continues her home defense against squirrels and butterflies", "sorry, cal", "so larry\u2019s basic feeling is hey, i am going to talk to this person who made the movie, or was in the movie, or who wrote the book as if i just sat next to them on an airplane seat", "oh, you wrote that book", "what\u2019s it about", "and then let the conversation go from there", "that\u2019s a great strategy because it\u2019s very natural and it allows the person to be just as natural", "i\u2019ve gone both ways", "in fact, i don\u2019t really follow pop culture that much and certainly when i moved out to los angeles in \u201808, rarely followed it before then", "once you\u2019re in la, it\u2019s hard to not be part of the pop culture because it\u2019s all around you", "esquire, as soon as i moved out there, they came up with a pretty funny idea, knowing that i didn\u2019t know much about current movies", "they hatched a plan to send me out to do a cover story but the only thing they told me was, \u201cwe just want you to go out and do a story about a guy; his name is gerry.\u201d i said, \u201cwhat else?\u201d that\u2019s it, just \u201chis name is gerry.\u201d and they gave me his address", "such a setup", "not only that but they told me, \u201clook, it\u2019s just a short interview", "don\u2019t sweat it", "his name\u2019s gerry", "just go out and talk to him for a few minutes and come back and write something up.\u201d it didn\u2019t seem like a big trick to me", "in the meantime, gerard butler, the actor, is waiting in his house and he\u2019s appeared in a few movies at this point, one of which was 300", "another one was phantom of the opera", "i hadn\u2019t seen either of those movies and i had no idea who he was", "he is sitting at home getting his first cover story for esquire", "he\u2019s consented to a three-hour interview", "a few minutes", "yeah, i\u2019m going in a few minutes for gerry and he\u2019s thinking: okay, cover story, esquire", "so i knock on the door and i\u2019m like, \u201chey, is gerry here?\u201d and then i said, \u201cto be honest, i have no idea who you are but the magazine has sent me to interview you for a few minutes.\u201d h e\u2019s looking at me and his eyes are squinting, like this guy\u2019s putting me on", "this guy\u2019s putting me on", "and i said, \u201cno, no, no", "really i have no idea who you are.\u201d he\u2019s caught between the squinting of the eyes and then there\u2019s a smile on his face because he\u2019s an actor who can go with it", "so he wants to go with it but he\u2019s wary", "understandably", "this is a setup, this is a setup", "and he keeps looking for that little string to pull that\u2019s going to take the garment and just unravel it and prove that i\u2019m an imposter", "but there\u2019s nothing he can do because i have no idea who this guy is", "i said to him, \u201cthe good thing about this is for ten years i\u2019ve traveled around the world and i would just get on trains and sit next to people, and we\u2019d just go and get a chance to meet each other", "so why don\u2019t we just approach it like that?\u201d so he\u2019s \u201cokay, okay.\u201d i said, \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d just that question, like i don\u2019t believe you, i don\u2019t believe it, i don\u2019t believe this", "then he starts telling me he\u2019s from paisley in scotland", "i think, at first, i couldn\u2019t tell if it was australia, is it england, is it scotland", "the accent", "yeah", "then i said, \u201cscotland?\u201d and he says \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d then he starts giving me his background and it\u2019s only about 20 minutes into the interview where it comes out", "and then i started to act", "i said, \u201coh, you\u2019re an actor?\u201d and he says, \u201cthis is just the biggest bunch of malarkey", "i know you\u2019re a film buff, this whole thing is being recorded to put me on.\u201d i said, \u201cno, gerry, i have no idea who you are.\u201d and now the rest of this interview, he\u2019s like trying to prove to me that he is a world class actor", "poor guy", "the amazing thing about it was we\u2019re talking and talking, and still it hasn\u2019t occurred to me that this is a cover story", "i still think this is \u2013 a little interview; a few minutes with gerry", "yeah", "so at a certain point we take a little break, and he says, \u201cyou need to use the bathroom", "use the one off my bedroom", "here, i\u2019ll show you.\u201d we start walking into his bedroom and there is an esquire on a nightstand, and it\u2019s got megan fox, the actress, on the cover", "he makes this offhand comment, like: \u201cgeez, why would they want to put me on the cover of esquire when you can have megan fox?\u201d and then it hits me: oh, my god, i\u2019ve got to write a cover story about this", "oh, no", "so we sat back down and i said \u201calright, gerry.\u201d let\u2019s shift gears here", "\u201cwhat movies were you in?\u201d he said something like, \u201creally?\u201d he brings up, he says well \u2013 this was the topper", "he says, \u201ci was in 300.\u201d and i haven\u2019t seen it", "i said, \u201c300, you know, i remember seeing \u2013 think i saw a poster of that movie", "it was these kind of gladiator guys, and i remember a beard.\u201d and gerry says, \u201cthat was me", "that was me!\u201d we\u2019re talking about 300 and he says, \u201cin this issue with megan fox on the cover, it also had a story, \u201cthe 75 movies that every man must see.\u201d so he says, \u201ci\u2019ll show you.\u201d and he picks up this issue and he says, \u201ci guarantee you 300 is one of the 75 movies that every man must see", "i\u2019ll show you.\u201d he opens it up to the story", "he goes on page one and he\u2019s looking", "\u201cthese movies are pretty good.\u201d he gets to page two", "\u201cyeah, that is really good.\u201d and he\u2019s not seeing 300", "he turns the page and he says, \u201cfuckers!\u201d he turns the next page", "\u201cfuck", "fuck!\u201d then he gets to the last page; it\u2019s not there", "he\u2019s like, \u201cfuck", "how could they not put 300 in here?\u201d and i\u2019m saying okay, okay, what else are we in", "he said, \u201cphantom of the opera.\u201d come on, gerry", "you can\u2019t sing like that", "i saw that broadway show", "i got roped into it", "i don\u2019t like musicals but my wife does and so we went", "like you can\u2019t sing like that", "\u201ci was the phantom!\u201d and so the whole interview is going on where he\u2019s trying to prove to me that he\u2019s an actor and belongs on the cover of esquire", "and we have a great time", "true to the actual beginning of the interview where i said to him, \u201clook, i sit down on trains with people and they take me home.\u201d at the end of the interview he\u2019s saying, \u201chey, you want to use my big screen", "come back anytime.\u201d like we\u2019re tight", "it\u2019s been a great time", "i\u2019m getting ready to leave, and he disappears", "and right before i leave, the house fills with music from phantom of the opera", "he comes down and he starts singing, note for note, to the music", "and i said, \u201cokay, gerry", "i know who you are.\u201d wow", "so there was a case where i had not a clue \u2013 not a clue \u2013 who i was interviewing and it works, just being natural", "that would work for you; also not for all interviewers, right", "given your background, in the same way that perhaps if you went into a war conflict interview format where you had three minutes to hit someone with a left hook, you might not be as adaptable as the univision interviewer, right", "that format, the stranger on the train scenario, is something you\u2019ve very well adapted to take advantage of", "you know, it\u2019s interesting", "jorge ramos was telling me a story", "the only time that he actually got thrown out of an interview or pushed away before donald trump was with fidel castro", "and it was a very tricky situation he was in, and castro knew it", "castro knew who he was", "so they\u2019re at a conference, and jorge manages to get next to castro, and he\u2019s got his mic and he starts asking him questions", "what castro did was put his arm around jorge", "for photos and whatnot", "because the camera is in on this", "and so the look now is that you\u2019re pals", "which, if you\u2019re jorge, you do not want to be seen as pals with \u2013 that\u2019s clever, though, on the part of fidel", "right", "so jorge has got to come back at him and manage to wriggle away", "to wriggle away like a toddler", "wriggle away and then hit him with a tough question, at which point one of castro\u2019s bodyguards elbowed him away like, out, this is over", "i never have to think like that because my feeling is if somebody\u2019s going to feel comfortable with me, then i\u2019ll get to the deep, eternal truths", "i don\u2019t want to push them back or off guard, or make them nervous or make them think about what they have to say", "so it\u2019s completely different styles", "hence, the scotch rule", "yeah, hence the scotch rule", "there are, for people who are wondering, and there are many questions that popped up about questions since that\u2019s what many people associate you with, good questions", "and i feel like i should mention that there are very contrasting styles, even very different from both larry\u2019s approach, your approach, and jorge ramos\u2019 approach, such as james lipton, inside the actor\u2019s studio", "i\u2019ve spent time with some of his researchers who i\u2019ve paid to look at past transcripts of my podcasts to try to help me improve", "but the format is completely different", "because in the case of, say, james lipton, i believe he knows the answer to every question he\u2019s going to ask", "there\u2019s a tremendous amount of in-depth research and prep that goes into it", "for me personally, it really kind of depends on the guest and the circumstances", "some are really, really deeply researched, particularly if i\u2019m nervous", "then others, i\u2019m coming in relatively blind because i feel like it\u2019s a complex enough subject that i want to have myself in the shoes of the majority of the people listening, if that makes sense, like physics or mathematics or something like that", "who are some interviewers that you greatly admire, alive or dead, besides larry", "there are very few good interviewers that i don\u2019t admire", "this conversation is kind of explaining it all", "they were all completely different so that when i look at them, i see what they\u2019re doing, i see how they\u2019re doing it", "i admire barbara walters and i know that she has scripted her interviews, a little different from lipton because she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s coming", "but she\u2019s got question no", "1, question no", "2, question no", "3", "she has story boarded her interviews from start to finish, and meticulously", "there\u2019s a progression", "there\u2019s an arc", "i can see how she makes it work for her", "charlie rose, the research that he does is absolutely fantastic", "the interesting thing about charlie rose is when he\u2019s interviewing somebody, you think like he\u2019s on almost an equal level of intelligence or material as the person that he\u2019s interviewing", "that works great for him", "matt lauer is a master at getting people to feel comfortable", "i know where this comes from because i interviewed him", "when he was a kid, he worked in a men\u2019s shop", "he said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re a salesman, you have to observe the person coming in through the door, see what they\u2019re looking at, what\u2019s the right time to approach, when is it time to back off.\u201d all of that translates into his interviews and you can see why he makes people feel so comfortable", "it came from that clothing store", "same story, different background with barbara walters, right", "you were mentioning this to me yesterday", "if you\u2019d elaborate on that for a second, also, just as another example of how the background forms the interviewer", "with barbara walters, her dad owned a famous nightclub in new york called the latin quarter", "so all the famous celebrities were in this place night after night", "she was sitting and talking with them as if they were friends", "that allowed her, later on in life, to have that same vibe in her conversations with people while she interviewed them, because she was just accustomed to sitting next to them and casually talking to them", "if you don\u2019t have that experience, you might be put off; you might be a little nervous", "and that might be something you have to overcome by repeatedly doing it", "but probably in her case, the first time she sat in on a celebrity interview, it was not much different from being at her dad\u2019s nightclub", "for someone who doesn\u2019t have \u2013 i don\u2019t want people to get the impression that you have to have this extensive childhood experience with something or another to become a good interviewer, because i don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, necessarily", "maybe i\u2019m missing something in my own background", "there are a number of questions to this effect", "we\u2019ve chatted about this a little bit", "but for instance, here\u2019s a question from david dronet, what are the top three specific questions he asks most often during interviews that he finds are the most revealing", "now, i suspect i know what part of your answer will be to this", "but the two that i would offer for people who are opening an interview and are really nervous, one was what you asked \u2013 where you from", "very simple", "the other one that seems to buy a lot of time for me in my experience if i just don\u2019t know where to go or where to start, i\u2019ll say: tell me the story of how you became x, an actor or whatever", "you\u2019ve immediately bought yourself probably five minutes of time to figure out what your next move is, and you\u2019ll get something in the answer that will help you figure out your next move", "but how would you answer this question, because i\u2019m sure you get some variation of this question all the time", "the big thing that i\u2019m noticing from the people who ask this question, because once i started to speak, this question kept coming up again and again", "it\u2019s like, what\u2019s the holy grail of questions, here, so i could use them", "i always say it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a holy grail of questions", "look, i come prepared", "i\u2019ve got like 200 questions in my mind when i show up for an interview because i\u2019ve thought about them", "i\u2019ve written them down and then i\u2019ve ripped them up", "the thing is, it\u2019s not that first question that i\u2019m really dependent on", "that first question is just opening the door", "then the answer is going to spark my second question", "and that\u2019s going to take me down a flight of steps, like deeper into the person\u2019s soul", "and then when they answer the second question, that\u2019s going to bring up a third question", "by the sixth answer, maybe that\u2019s where i wanted to go with my first question", "so it\u2019s a process", "it\u2019s not a use this and you will be successful, too", "it\u2019s not an incantation", "yeah", "it\u2019s also filled with curiosity", "because what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re just listening to see where the answers take you", "it\u2019s the answers that are going to take you where you want to go", "the questions are there just to open the doors for the answers", "so relying on one question to get you to the bottom of something is something i wouldn\u2019t do", "but you know what", "that\u2019s a good question for jorge ramos because he\u2019s had to think really carefully", "if he knows i\u2019ve only got five minutes with this president of a latin american country, and he\u2019s got to ask something that\u2019s going to get a response that everybody talks about, he might ask a question like, how much did your house cost", "then if the person says well, i don\u2019t know", "you don\u2019t know how much your house costs", "any answer is an answer, in that case", "i won\u2019t answer that tells you quite a lot", "the mask tells you more than what\u2019s underneath the mask", "that\u2019s what he\u2019s working in", "he\u2019s really thinking hard about what he\u2019s going to ask, knowing that he doesn\u2019t have much time and also knowing that he\u2019s there for the people", "right", "this is a point that i think about quite a lot but in the converse way", "meaning, i\u2019ll have guests on who are known or have been known at some point for some type of scandal", "if you\u2019re in the public eye long enough, eventually something\u2019s going to come up", "you\u2019re going to make a misstep, you\u2019re going to say something stupid", "and there are some fans \u2013 not a lot \u2013 who are like, why didn\u2019t you ask him about this", "why didn\u2019t you ask her about that", "in my case, i do have a lot of time", "i have two to three hours to uncover, in my particular format, tactics and tools and so on", "so if i ask how much did your house cost", "that\u2019s the equivalent of not accepting the scotch times a hundred", "they\u2019ll go, oh, it\u2019s one of these, and the doors get shut", "that\u2019s effectively the end of the interview, even if it lasts another two hours", "they will not give me anything they wouldn\u2019t give a stranger who\u2019s potentially hostile", "so it\u2019s a completely different style of interviewing", "but you know what", "the way i would approach that is not with a direct question, but just by allowing the conversation to circle around that area and invite him or her to explain the scandal through that and then you can be into it", "best example i can give you about that is when larry king was just getting started in miami on radio", "he was sitting at a table with a friend of his at the time, jackie gleason, honeymooners", "yeah, for sure", "so they had become friends", "jackie had asked this question around the table, what\u2019s impossible", "i guess there was a doctor at the table who said, \u201cwe\u2019ll never have artificial blood.\u201d and it gets to larry, and larry says, \u201cwhat\u2019s impossible", "i have a three-hour radio show", "getting frank sinatra to appear on my radio show, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d and jackie gleason pointed to him and said, \u201cyou got it.\u201d as it turned out, frank had been doing a concert or a series of concerts and lost his voice and needed to be replaced one night", "he called jackie, and he said, \u201chey, jackie, can you go on and do a comedy bit for me so that nobody\u2019s upset?\u201d frank says, \u201ci owe you one.\u201d so after that conversation with larry and the others, jackie calls up frank and says, \u201chey, frank", "this is the one", "there\u2019s this kid, larry king", "he\u2019s just starting out in radio, miami beach", "he\u2019s got a three-hour show", "i need you to go on for three hours.\u201d frank says, \u201cyou want it", "you got it.\u201d now, nobody can believe it", "this is like a little radio station", "at the time, i\u2019m imagining that sinatra is the biggest of the big", "yeah", "not only that, but frank, as his pr guy points out, the public relations guy is basically employed to say no to all these requests like this", "i\u2019m very familiar", "the people at the radio station can\u2019t believe it because larry says, \u201ci got frank sinatra coming in friday night,\u201d or whatever night it was and the radio wants to do all this publicity", "they say, \u201care you sure he\u2019s gonna show?\u201d this is a little station", "larry king is not big time; this is what made larry king big time", "the radio station is calling over to where frank is staying, asking just to get a confirmation", "no response, no response, no response", "the show was on at 9:00", "finally, at two minutes to 9:00, frank comes through the door with his publicist", "and the publicist pulls larry aside and says, \u201ci don\u2019t know how you got this because my job is to not let this happen", "but he said he wants to do it", "okay, i\u2019m just telling you one thing", "do not ask about the kidnapping of his son, just don\u2019t.\u201d and larry is young and so grateful \u2013 whatever you say, whatever you say", "the interview starts, and larry is dumbfounded", "so he says to frank \u2013 talk about starting an interview \u2013 he says to frank \u2013 where are you from", "no, i\u2019m just kidding", "no, even better", "he says, \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d frank explained, and larry didn\u2019t even know the back-story", "so frank is having to explain to him, \u201cgleason substituted for me and i owed him one", "then he said: frank, this is the one", "and so i\u2019m here.\u201d the interview starts going, and an hour passes or whatever", "and midway into the interview, frank is feeling very comfortable", "larry says to him, \u201cdo you feel, frank, you\u2019ve ever gotten a bum rap?\u201d frank says, \u201cabsolutely", "in the case of my son getting kidnapped.\u201d and then he just goes into the whole story", "so larry didn\u2019t ask the question directly; he just made frank feel at home", "so that is more where i line up, as opposed to the style of going in there and saying we\u2019ve got sinatra", "corner the wild beast", "yeah", "the camera\u2019s in front of him", "if we ask him about it and he doesn\u2019t want to answer, we\u2019re still going to get his reaction", "i don\u2019t go that way", "it\u2019s also, from my perspective, a very mercenary way of doing things and a very transactional away", "contrasted with if you take the approach that larry did, he\u2019s developing friendships, not just good tape, over time", "exactly", "at least, i would say, a third of the guests that i\u2019ve had on the podcast came as recommendations from other guests and introductions", "that wouldn\u2019t happen if i had a transactional \u201cgotcha\u201d type of approach", "and just to reiterate what you said, the exact, same experience is something i\u2019ve had on at least two dozen of my interviews", "in the sense that i always ask guests beforehand, because the show is not about making people look bad; it\u2019s about tactics and routines and habits and all the stuff that people can use", "i\u2019ll ask, \u201cis there anything you really don\u2019t want to talk about or prefer not to talk about?\u201d and not often, but every once in a while somebody will say i really don\u2019t want to talk about x", "if i make them feel comfortable, and if i do one thing which neil strauss, who is a very good writer and very accomplished interviewer for rolling stone and new york times, he said to me, \u201cif you want them to be vulnerable, be vulnerable yourself.\u00a0give up some details of your life that are very vulnerable.\u201d so i made that a habit", "i\u2019d say in about half of the cases, they end up talking about exactly the thing they said they didn\u2019t want to talk about", "they bring it up themselves", "it only makes sense because when people feel comfortable, then they\u2019re going to speak normally", "they\u2019re going to forget they\u2019re being interviewed", "later on in life, frank actually wrote larry a note that said, \u201cyou make the cameras disappear.\u201d i think that\u2019s what you, as an interviewer, want to do", "you want to make people forget they\u2019re being interviewed and just speak with you naturally", "now, that\u2019s just my style", "other people, they want it to be known it\u2019s an interview", "if you show up with a pad in front of you and cameras, then it\u2019s an interview", "the pad is going to tell the person that is across from you, there are questions written down", "this is an interview", "be advised", "so that\u2019s just something i would never, never do but that\u2019s just me; that\u2019s just my style", "you mentioned that you think about the questions, write down the questions, then tear them up", "i\u2019m curious about this", "do you review a list of questions and then the day before, or before you walk into someone\u2019s house, just tear it up into little shreds and throw it in a wastebasket", "what does your process look like for adding the ammo to your brain", "it\u2019s a matter of you do your research", "then there\u2019s a period of curiosity where you\u2019ve taken in all this information, and now what are you curious about", "so you just start writing down questions", "for me, it comes very easily", "i\u2019ll just start writing, writing, writing and then pages will be filled up", "the way i look at it, it\u2019s almost like i\u2019m putting songs in a jukebox and the questions are my songs", "i\u2019m just going to have these songs in there", "they\u2019re in my head", "i know the words to the songs", "i can sing the songs", "then i rip them up", "it\u2019s more of like a ceremonial act", "the questions are no longer on paper; they\u2019re in my head", "so when i go into the interview, interesting things start happening", "no", "1, because all these questions are in my head, i\u2019m never at a loss for a question", "i\u2019ve talked to some writers who say what happens when you run out of questions", "well, i don\u2019t because my jukebox is filled", "but more than that, what will happen is i\u2019ll ask a question, and i\u2019ll get a response and then i\u2019m working off the responses", "but oftentimes, the response will lead to a question i\u2019ve already thought of", "so it\u2019s like they\u2019re hitting the jukebox and they\u2019re playing the music", "they\u2019re getting the question that they want because that\u2019s where they were going", "right, they used the proper cue, in a sense", "right", "so my mind was prepared to ask them the question that they wanted to hear to make them more comfortable", "my style \u2013 and other people can try it and see if it works for them \u2013but there\u2019s something relaxing about it to me", "i\u2019ve interviewed people who have shows on tv where they have to interview people, and i come in without any questions or pad", "and you can see this shocked look on their faces", "you don\u2019t write down your questions", "because they might feel like, what will i do on camera if i can\u2019t think of a question", "it might look bad", "having that pad there is a safety net", "but once you do it this way a few times, you\u2019re free", "neil does the same thing, neil strauss", "i don\u2019t think he tears them up but he folds it up and puts it in his pocket and doesn\u2019t look at it at all", "and i think if i were to underscore something that you both have in common, it\u2019s that you\u2019re very good at getting people to open up about things that they would be disinclined to open up about normally in an interview", "i think that\u2019s a big part of it", "it\u2019s like if you have a camera with a flashing red light, people put on their body armor", "the more you can make it a conversation as opposed to an interview, like you said, if you can remove the symptoms of an interview so to speak, the pad of paper, the flashing lights, the more naturally people will engage with you and the more they will share", "now you\u2019re getting into oprah territory", "imagine this", "you\u2019ve got the flashing lights, you\u2019ve got an audience that\u2019s reacting, and then you\u2019ve got a subject on the couch", "and she is getting them to speak about things that are very intimate in front of a crowd and the flashing lights", "that\u2019s a high, high level of jiu-jitsu", "yeah, she\u2019s amazing", "if you were to ask me what is impossible, my answer currently would be getting oprah on my three-hour podcast, so we\u2019ll see", "we\u2019ll see if that manifests something", "i wish i could say you got it", "you got it", "oprah owes me a solid", "oprah owes me one", "don\u2019t worry about this", "this may have a good amount of overlap with things we\u2019ve already talked about, but this is from devon hedgepess \u2013 best strategies to get to the heart while interviewing", "find out what they love", "i mean, it\u2019s that simple", "especially if you\u2019re able to do the research before, just hone in on something they\u2019re passionate about and they love talking about and just ask them about it", "they\u2019re going to be happy to talk about it", "it\u2019s very simple", "it\u2019s the exact opposite of going in feeling like a journalist who is determined to get a question answered", "i\u2019ve got to get this", "you talked about \u201cgotcha\u201d but there\u2019s like a level underneath that that\u2019s not so much gotcha, it\u2019s a legitimate okay, we need to know this", "if you go in trying to grab something from anyone, they\u2019re going to protect it", "so just make people relax by finding out what they like and then have them talk about it", "this is really good advice", "it took me a long time to figure out that, for myself at least, and i\u2019m still very much a novice, but sometimes the best place to start is really far off of any topic they\u2019ve covered in interviews related to their profession", "i remember interviewing edward norton, and i\u2019d spent a good amount of time with edward", "but the way he interacts in interviews could be very different than the way he interacts over coffee having normal conversation", "so i wanted to make him feel as relaxed as possible, so we just talked about surfing for the first five to ten minutes of the interview", "i remember that", "we were sitting out on the malibu pier overlooking the water", "we could see the surf line up", "and i was like, okay, let\u2019s talk about surfing", "that\u2019s just a clear example of doing something that\u2019s very natural and getting somebody to feel at one with you and the place", "to me, making the person, the subject, feel safe and comfortable, that\u2019s where it all starts", "obviously there\u2019s research before and there\u2019s the preparation of questions", "but if you can\u2019t make a person feel safe, forget it", "although look, that\u2019s just me", "jorge ramos is going in there", "he is not making them feel safe and he makes it work for him", "yeah, he\u2019s doing the jon snow charging into battle approach", "yeah", "from where he comes from, that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary", "oh, you need that", "he can\u2019t go in warm and fuzzy; that won\u2019t work, i wouldn\u2019t think", "his audience is his audience because they know he\u2019s going in to fight for them", "a big part of this is realizing who you are", "where do you come from, how do you want to get your own message across", "just the way you were speaking, you\u2019re helping to uplift people", "i\u2019m trying, yeah", "so your style is based on that", "i don\u2019t know that i ever looked at an interview as a way of uplifting somebody but it\u2019s a very interesting way for me to look at it", "because interestingly, i don\u2019t do it in interviews but when i give speeches or workshops, that\u2019s what i do; i\u2019m uplifting people", "that\u2019s the intention", "yeah", "we\u2019ve been talking about this over the last couple of days and you just lit the light bulb in my head", "because i\u2019ve been saying to myself, what\u2019s going on", "i\u2019m kind of moving into a place where i\u2019m like a player coach, now", "that\u2019s not who i was, but i\u2019m finding that i really enjoy this in a way that i didn\u2019t get out of writing a story in a magazine", "i just understood why in this conversation", "because it allows me to do what you do in an interview", "it allows me to help uplift people", "so if people are working in a company and the company is not hiring the right people because they\u2019re not interviewing them in the right way, i can give them information that is going to help them hire better and have a better company, and that makes me feel great", "at the end of it, they\u2019re saying thank you and hugging me", "generally at the end of an interview, i hug people sometimes at the end of interviews, and people say thanks", "but it\u2019s a different kind of thanks", "when somebody walks out of an interview and says thanks, it\u2019s hey, that was a really good time", "when somebody walks out of a workshop and says thank you, it\u2019s a very different thing", "there was this one woman \u2013 man, this is just hitting me as we\u2019re talking \u2013 who, at the end of this workshop, says, \u201cyou know, i spend more time on my job than i do at home", "i hire the people that are around me on my job", "i didn\u2019t know any of this about interviewing until you told us, and this is going to affect all the people i put around me going forward", "thank you.\u201d that was an experience that i\u2019d never had before", "so this is why \u2013 i\u2019m just understanding this now", "why i\u2019m compelled to go in this other direction", "well, i\u2019m excited to see the new direction", "we also have some barbecue to eat in the not-too-distant future", "so i think this has been great fun", "we have so much more we could talk about: how to approach second time interviews, we were going to talk about george clooney", "maybe that\u2019ll be in part three", "there\u2019s so much that we could cover and so many great stories", "but where can people find you online and where can they say hi", "you\u2019ve got calfussman.com, and i just got kevin the manager to make sure that when you send an email in, he\u2019ll get it to me", "kevin the manager", "kevin the manager", "he\u2019ll get it to me and we\u2019ll get back to you", "and then on twitter, is it @calfussman", "yeah", "i\u2019ve got to do a better job on twitter", "let\u2019s see if i can get jocko willink to sit you down and give you a tutorial", "he\u2019s got plenty to do, but he\u2019s doing a great job on twitter", "i\u2019d love to meet jocko", "that was a great talk", "he\u2019s incredible", "he\u2019s an incredible human being", "tough young man, that jocko", "well, cal, this is always so much fun", "thank you for taking the time and i think i need to feed you more yerba mate, man", "that was a hell of a tear", "that was good", "you know what people don\u2019t realize is we don\u2019t know if the last installment was affected by the last tea", "this caramel tea that i didn\u2019t realize puts you away", "we\u2019ve been having tea and last night i was like, \u201ccal, you want some tea?\u201d he was like, sure", "there was a big collection of tea and so after we did the evening, the p.m", "session interview yesterday, cal\u2019s like, \u201ci really like this tea.\u201d he pointed to the caramel bedtime tea which literally, in the past when i\u2019ve taken it, has made me feel like leonardo dicaprio at the payphone in wolf of wall street", "i remember that, yeah, yeah", "i was like, holy god, i can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even standing right now", "i was very impressed you powered through that", "so we\u2019ll focus on the south american stimulants, meaning yerba mate in the future, perhaps", "but guys listening, we will have links to everything we can track down in the show notes", "of course, cal\u2019s site and social and so on", "please say hi to him", "anything else to add before we sign off", "the whole weekend has been an absolute delight", "i come out of here almost a changed man", "it sounds odd", "we\u2019ve had about 36 hours of conversation and that part of you, that uplifting part of you, has taken me to places i\u2019m just starting, light bulbs are just starting to go off in my mind", "so i can\u2019t wait to come back for the third, because i don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to take me", "it\u2019s just a joy to hang out with you, man", "if i can, in my own meandering way, offer a few things from the path that i\u2019ve already traveled, then that makes my whole weekend", "i always learn so much from you so i feel like very selfishly i\u2019m learning a lot more than i\u2019m giving out", "i don\u2019t know about that", "but i am fixing your shoulder with the sauna", "we have this barrel sauna which came from specks, developed by laird hamilton and then i think either duplicated or refined by rick ruben when we actually recorded the interview in there and burned our hands on the mics", "but so many adventures to have and we\u2019re just getting started", "so everybody listening, you can find the show notes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast as always, for this episode and every other", "until next time, thank you for listening"]}
