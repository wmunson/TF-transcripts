It\u2019s Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers, to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, etc. that you can use. This episode features Michael Gervais. He\u2019s @MichaelGervais, G-E-R-V-A-I-S on Twitter. Michael is one of the few performance psychologists that elite athletes and coaches, among others, turn to when they want to level up or when they\u2019re returning from hard times and want to not just get back to where they were, but exceed their previous highest levels of excellence. His clients include Olympic gold medalists, Super Bowl-winning NFL coaches, you name it. It\u2019s an incredible roster. In this episode, we discuss how to win the war against anxiety, some of the more effective and less effective ways, even self-defeating ways to use self-talk; behind-the-scenes stories of Michael\u2019s clients, understanding the path to master the process to mastery and much more. The audio from this episode comes from my new TV show, fear{less}, which is \u201cfear\u201d and then \u201cless\u201d in parenthesis because it\u2019s not about being fearless, but learning to fear less, where I interview people like this, world-class performers, on stage in front of a live audience about how they\u2019ve overcome doubt, conquered fear, made their toughest decisions and so on. You can watch the entire first episode, which is with David Blaine, the illusionist and master endurance artist, for free at att.net/fearless. To watch all of the episodes, there are ten of them, you can go to tim.blog/fearless and if you are a cord cutter, just click on DirectTV now, which is a button there. Any of the packages get you the show. So you can chose the cheapest one if you like. We recorded three hours of material in this particular episode of Michael and only one hour was used for TV. So this podcast episode is almost entirely new, exclusive content for y\u2019all, my listeners, because I love ya. It did not appear on television. I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did. Without further ado, here is Michael Gervais. Welcome to fear{less}. I\u2019m your host, Tim Ferriss. On this very stage, we\u2019ll be deconstructing world-class performers of all different types to uncover the specific tactics they\u2019ve used to overcome doubt, tackle their hardest decisions, and ultimately succeed on their own terms. Imagine yourself standing 127,000 above the earth, trying to set the freefall world record. Or stepping onto the field for the Super Bowl or perhaps attempting to take gold at the Olympics. If you were nervous or if you had to prepare for that, who would you turn to? Who would you ask for help? In less than a decade, my guest has built a very impressive client roster that includes Olympic gold medalists like Kerri Walsh Jennings, teams like the Seattle Seahawks, and the U.S. Armed Forces. Please welcome to the stage Dr. Michael Gervais. Michael Gervais: Thank you. How are you? Thank you. The step will get you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, the step has gotten me. You guys ready for a show? Audience: Yeah! Tim Ferriss: All right. Just describe your family a little bit. What did your parents do? Do you have siblings? Michael Gervais: Yeah, okay. So I have one younger sister. I was actually born in a city and they said okay, we\u2019re done, and they moved out to the farm, a farm. Now, this isn\u2019t a glamorous farm. We had 12 chickens and a pony, not a glamorous farm. They moved out to the farm to get away, to get back to finding who they were. And so that was what it felt like for me for a long time. We didn\u2019t have heat in the winter, in the middle of winter in Virginia. We had a wood-burning stove that at age 6, 7, 8 years old, I was chopping wood, literally. Carrying a lot of wood. Pop saying, \u201cHey, listen, if you want to be warm tonight, that wood\u2019s got to get into the fireplace some kind of way.\u201d So that\u2019s where I feel like I figured out some roots and sorted out what it meant to listen to nature. We had a large amount of land behind us. We didn\u2019t have lights; there were no street lights. I needed to figure out \u2013 my parents were really laissez-faire, if you will. They allowed me to explore. If I didn\u2019t get home by nighttime, it was a long night. The fear of that \u2013 I never really got stuck out at night \u2013 but the fear of that was real. I figured out how to tune a bit to nature and then working hard was just part of the process. Tim Ferriss: When did that change? When did the farm cease to be home base? Michael Gervais: Middle of fourth grade, which I think is an important footnote. That it was the middle of a school year. Because they did that to me a couple times. And so changing it in a school grade is one thing, but then changing in the middle requires a different type of transition skill. Being put in an amphitheater, whatever that amphitheater is, is one of the greatest teachers. Far beyond what we learn from books and watching others, but figuring out transitions or any other skill is really important by doing. So welcome to California. Tim Ferriss: How\u2019d that go for you? Michael Gervais: It was hard. Tim Ferriss: How did that go for you and were there any specific tactics that you used or approaches to \u2013 Michael Gervais: No, as a fourth grader, I didn\u2019t have any tactics. I was like, okay, I\u2019m going to miss my friends, but this seems like it could be okay. Because they sold me on California, the dream of California. Then we moved again. And so we went from northern California to southern California and it was mid-year, mid-year again, freshman year. We actually moved again in sixth grade, at the beginning of the year. It would be nice if the theme ran through. But yeah, so we moved down to southern California. I didn\u2019t want to go. I wasn\u2019t into it. Where I was growing up at the time, I was having just a lot of fun with motocross and motorcycle and BMX and just loving that type of stuff up in northern California. It was the right move for the family. They dragged me along with them. Then there I am in southern California. I know that there\u2019s that story that I hear often from some of the best in the world that they knew at an early age that they wanted to do fill-in-the-blanks. Whether it\u2019s music or sports or art or business. I didn\u2019t have that. I was really more interested in today and figuring out how to do today the best way I possibly could, as a 6-year old and a 16-year old. No one in my family went to college. I didn\u2019t know anyone that went to college. I didn\u2019t. If they did, they didn\u2019t talk about. I certainly didn\u2019t know anyone that had a graduate degree. Tim Ferriss: Were you good in school? Michael Gervais: No. The assistant principal, the Dean of my high school, pulled my then-girlfriend, now-wife, cool story, pulled her aside and said, \u201cWhat is a nice girl like you dating Gervais?\u201d Kind of heavy in school the way that went down. But that was an indication that I was not on the right path. I didn\u2019t have a structure to really help me get the right path. I learned a lot the hard way. I had no idea that there was even this profession about being able to give back through understanding how the mind works. That\u2019s how my journey began. Tim Ferriss: So if you were to teach any class or mandate, this is a better question, mandate certain types of experiences for, it could be high school students or, in this case, college students. What might they be or mandatory classes? Michael Gervais: If I could create a class that was mandatory for incoming freshmen or whatever? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Michael Gervais: Yeah. It would be dangerous. For sure, we are raising children that are \u2013 I don\u2019t know how old you are \u2013 Tim Ferriss: 39. Michael Gervais: Yeah, so you grew up probably kind of with a seatbelt, but not always maybe. Tim Ferriss: Mostly off leash, just like faceplanting skateboarding down hills and stuff like that. Michael Gervais: Our generation right now is every one of them grew up with instant access to whatever and everyone\u2019s buckled in safety harnesses from the beginnings of their life. We don\u2019t have a real appreciation for danger. So we pompously walk around with a soft underbelly thinking that we understand what\u2019s true and real and beautiful and hard and honest. It\u2019s the rugged and hostile environments that teach us. They teach us by leveraging real fear. We say that we conquer fear. We say that we\u2019ll do things. But not until you\u2019re squarely facing it down does the risk of putting yourself in that situation provide insight. But that class would be too dangerous for modern times. Like there would be stuff that possibly people would get hurt, which would make it real and maybe somebody loses limbs or life or something, which makes it real. Because this bubble that we live in is problematic for the next generation. Tim Ferriss: I agree with that. Lord of the Flies 101. No, I agree. I couldn\u2019t agree more. I had someone ask me recently in Q&A, they said, \u201cHave you ever thought about doing a summer camp for adults?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, kind of occasionally maybe after too much wine thought about it.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWell, what would you have everyone do?\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cIt would be mostly suffering. You would definitely exercised until you vomited.\u201d All the hands go down. But yeah, definitely undervalued. It\u2019s thought of as a negative thing, but it\u2019s a tool and a teacher. When was the first time when you felt like you had made a huge mistake or failed someone? It doesn\u2019t have to be the first time. The first time that comes to mind. Michael Gervais: The first one that comes to mind will remain nameless for sure, but it was an entertainer that I just couldn\u2019t quite reach. It was hard. It was deep and it was rich. She made it. She survived, but I wasn\u2019t able to do what I had hoped we would do. It\u2019s those kind of haunting experiences. That one\u2019s not haunting, but I knew that I can\u2019t connect in the way \u2013 I can\u2019t access the depth and the richness that I need to go to because I have limitations of what I was able to do at that time. Tim Ferriss: What were the limitations? Michael Gervais: She could go deeper than I could go. Tim Ferriss: In what respect? Michael Gervais: Authenticity. To talk about the real stuff. So here\u2019s the full circle of the conversation. Before I finish that story, I don\u2019t think about failure that way though. Failure is not making a mistake; that\u2019s not failure. Failure is not being authentic. Failure is not going for it. Failure is being small. Whether you win or not, if you\u2019re authentically you and you go for it? Okay, it sounds easy. It sounds like you could put that in a fortune cookie, but that\u2019s really what it\u2019s about. So when you play it safe and small and you\u2019re not authentically yourself, it\u2019s your whole day is failing. Your whole month, your whole year. I don\u2019t think about it like that\u2019s a win, that\u2019s a loss, that\u2019s a failure, that\u2019s a mistake, that\u2019s good, that\u2019s bad. The experience is a day-to-day orientation to try to pivot and grow. It\u2019s relentless and it\u2019s hard and it\u2019s difficult. Back to this experience is that when I reshape how we think about failure, it really is about \u2013 no, let me, I think I finished that. When we talk about the emotional piece, is that if we can hold our ability to be authentically ourselves when it\u2019s difficult and that\u2019s only emotional. We use physical whatever to get to the emotional. There\u2019s no mental difficultyness, there\u2019s no such thing. Because they\u2019re just words, right? It\u2019s the emotional thing that\u2019s the hardest for us. So if we can hold presence, this is the gift to give another person. If we can hold presence when another person is rattling and they\u2019re a wreck, you\u2019re there for them in a really cool way. But if you can\u2019t go deep enough to be able to hold true and to be authentic with them, then they don\u2019t trust you. They take care of themselves and the work is not real. Tim Ferriss: In that case, when you\u2019re having difficulty going as deep as she went, was it not having enough present state awareness so she could tell you weren\u2019t truly paying attention? Was it not asking the harder questions? Michael Gervais: I was overwhelmed and so I couldn\u2019t be there authentically for another person. That is the essence of what love is. Tim Ferriss: How did that manifest? Michael Gervais: If you and I are having this conversation and you\u2019re checking your phone \u2013 I\u2019ll be dramatic, you\u2019re checking your phone, you\u2019re looking at your watch, you\u2019re checking to see if we\u2019re okay, you\u2019re checking out \u2013 because this is not interesting? Then I\u2019m going to be like F this. This sucks. So that\u2019s one level of it. It happens every day, all day long, every airport that I\u2019m in. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Deeper than that is if he or she is saying something and they\u2019re trying to see if they can go for it and I\u2019m missing it \u2013 people all the time will tell you who they are. You just have to listen. You have to be really present with them to hear the essence of what they\u2019re trying to communicate underneath the boy meets girl. There\u2019s Romeo and Juliet in every story, but we have to look for it, which is the emotional, gripping, true experience that people are wanting to sort out. So you have to get under there to do it. If I miss the lob that the person\u2019s giving, they\u2019re out. So that\u2019s kind of how relationships work. Michael Gervais: It was on the half yard line. It was a roller coaster of a third and fourth quarter. Tom Brady on the other side and that team, they did a phenomenal job. They did a phenomenal job. They\u2019re skilled, very skilled. So here it is on the half yard line. The entire stadium thought the ball was going to go to our running back \u2013 exceptional running back Marshawn Lynch. Bill Belichick \u2013 mind you, the intensity of trying to sort out what the next play is while the clock is going down, while there\u2019s an emotional stimulation that\u2019s taking place, is not an easy thing to do. That\u2019s a very complicated thing. When the environment is losing their minds, be clear about what the options are. Bill Belichick brings in his men to stop the running game. The coaches are like \u2013 because we brought in a particular unit that was just a beautiful play and it was a pass play. So I could see the coaches go, that\u2019s the match-up you want. That\u2019s the exact match-up. There\u2019s another thing about this match-up is that the Seattle Seahawks are 20 percent from running from the goal line. As a general rule, we want to put people and organizations in positions of strength, not roll the dice on positions of weakness, right? So being 20% from the goal line, those are not great odds. So they\u2019re matching up for the run, here we are trying to get to a pass play and the ball\u2019s intercepted and game\u2019s over. What was happening on the sideline before that is that we were ahead of time. The sidelines, not the men out here. But the sidelines were ahead of time. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that? Michael Gervais: If you think about music, music is benefit when it\u2019s on time. Even if there\u2019s some dissonance, but when it\u2019s on time. Ahead of time is that syncopation creates chaos. So we were on the sidelines because we weren\u2019t in the game, ahead of time. Ohmygod, we\u2019re winning the game! This is it! And then all of a sudden, we thought it was ours. Now I\u2019m speaking about me, really. I was ahead of time. And the ball\u2019s intercepted. The game\u2019s done. That team storms the field. What was it? Blue and silver tickertape is coming down. Our sideline was stunned. The emotions in the locker room afterwards, was the most intense environment I\u2019ve ever been in that didn\u2019t have real violence. Yearning and searching and questioning why was, on a scale of 1 to 10, 100. Anger and just being pissed off about what just happened because the loss \u2013 our brain is phenomenal as you well understand, but there\u2019s no redundancy in the brain, so the circuitry for grief and loss is the same circuitry for losing a game. So it was grief. It was the most intense grief, like somebody just came in at the last moment and took away everything that you thought was yours. It was exciting, it\u2019s a thing you\u2019ve worked your whole life for. So coming into that locker room, there was 6\u20198\u201d crying, 6\u20194\u201d ready to break someone\u2019s head open, 6\u20192\u201d was taking off his tape, ready to punch somebody. There was a person behind me that was screaming, \u201cWhy? Why is this happening?!!!\u201d There was another gentleman, another athlete in the back that was kind of snickering and laughing. And then there was plenty of people that were just completely overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know what to feel. Tim Ferriss: What are, and I\u2019ll give a personal example here, maybe some baby steps, remedial approaches that people can take if they\u2019ve had a hard time or suspect they would? In my case, I found the gateway drug to get me moving in the right direction was guided meditations. So listening to Tara Brach or Sam Harris or someone else. Basically every couple of seconds, just like, \u201cHey, idiot.\u201d Michael Gervais: Come on back. Tim Ferriss: \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about porn or your to-do list. Come back.\u201d In addition to that, I found a few apps like Headspace to be very helpful. But the thing that actually helped me to break through, and it\u2019s maybe embarrassing in a way to admit this, was social accountability. So I actually did take a course. In this case, it was transcendental meditation. But I knew that if I didn\u2019t meditate, I would have to go to the session the next day. And there was an hour set aside for me to talk about my two sessions, and I would just feel like an ass. And I also paid for it. So those are a few of the crutches that I used early on to get to the point where I had enough sessions under my belt that it became like brushing my teeth on some level. At some point, I became obsessed with Bhutan. Why on earth would I become obsessed with Bhutan? Well, there\u2019s this very romanticized story of gross national happiness and the happiest country in the world and so on. Well, one year they got overtaken in a poll by the Danes. So the Danish are now the happiest people in the world. I\u2019m like, the Danish? Okay. So I at one point ended up going to Denmark. I was like, \u201cAre you aware that you\u2019re supposedly the happiest people in the world?\u201d The guy was like, huh, drinking his beer. I said, \u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d He goes, \u201cLow expectations.\u201d It\u2019s easy to dismiss that and go like haha, but then I was like, no, there\u2019s actually something there. In my mind, if I sat down and meditated and I wasn\u2019t on point, like 90+ percent of the time \u2013 I was thinking of it as almost in terms of school grades \u2013 I was failing. I was losing. Michael Gervais: Because you weren\u2019t quiet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wasn\u2019t doing my job. I wasn\u2019t following the script. And I was having a conversation with Tara Brach, this very well-known Buddhist and meditation teacher. She has great talks that she gives regularly and they\u2019re recorded. I explained this. I was like, \u201cI could go from sitting down for 20 minutes or roughly 20 minutes,\u201d sort of what I do in the morning when I can, which is most days. I said, \u201cI could spend 19 minutes thinking about some cartoon I watched when I was a kid, like ThunderCats. For 19 minutes. And then I\u2019ll be like, Ferriss, you\u2019ve spent 19 minutes thinking about ThunderCats!\u201d Then I\u2019ll come back. She says, \u201cThat\u2019s a successful session.\u201d Because the training isn\u2019t getting it right, it\u2019s the coming back. The coming back is the rep. I was like, oh, okay. As soon as I thought of it in those terms, suddenly I was having successful sessions and I was able to stick with it. Michael Gervais: The misconception is the first trap. If you just focus on your breathing \u2013 there\u2019s two types of mindfulness training, the way that I\u2019ve come to learn about it: single point and contemplative. So single point is one thing over and over and over again so you notice when you leave that moment. Then the work is to come back. Once you become aware that you\u2019ve shifted from now, the breath of the dot on the wall or a mantra, whatever it might be, and you\u2019re over here, what do you do with that? Do you say mother\u2013 or do you say \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I want you to curse so bad. Michael Gervais: Come on back. Tim Ferriss: Don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a trap! Michael Gervais: Do you come back? Can you swiftly come back? Can you do that 1,000 times? That\u2019s the work. And then eventually, you\u2019ll slip into that no-minds experience. I\u2019ll tell you my first teach, he said, \u201cMike.\u201d Mind you, I don\u2019t know how old I am, I was young. But he says, \u201cIf you knew what I knew, you\u2019d be doing this every day.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, what do you mean?\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s like a full-body orgasm.\u201d Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s the way you sell it. Michael Gervais: Yeah, that\u2019s how you sell it. Oh, now you\u2019ve got my attention. I\u2019m still waiting, so maybe he sold me a bill of goods. Tim Ferriss: I think you just solved a major branding problem for mindfulness. You\u2019ve just got to sell it as full-body orgasm and you\u2019ll have people around the block. Let\u2019s take a left turn. You mentioned the importance of fighting earlier. I\u2019m taking it out of context, but it brings me back to the Seahawks insomuch as I\u2019ve heard, and this is not as someone who knows a lot about football, but that the Seahawk organization allows their players to resolve conflicts, to sort out their differences on the sidelines, amongst themselves on a regular basis. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. This is just something I\u2019ve heard. Is that true? Michael Gervais: The statement was that the Seahawks allow athletes to work out their conflicts. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, if there\u2019s a conflict between players. Michael Gervais: I think it was recently there was \u2013 I\u2019ll unpack the story surrounding it. Tim Ferriss: This is just me repeating something I heard. Michael Gervais: So go back to the principle that Coach Carroll set up that this is a relationship-based organization. When relationships matter, there\u2019s intensity around emotions. What happened just recently, this year, one athlete was angry. He was pissed. He threw his helmet. He was in a fit of rage. There\u2019s a couple courses that would take place, a couple predictable things that could take place. People would be like, whoa, that\u2019s too much now, stay away. Or they can come up and become aggressive with him and jump in his face and say that\u2019s not okay. What most people do in most organizations when somebody\u2019s raging, and I mean raging, full of testosterone and strength, is that they back up because it\u2019s dangerous for them. Even though destruction is taking place. When one person \u2013 football is a beautiful team environment. When one person\u2019s off, the whole thing is working to try to help that person. That\u2019s what teams and tribes do. They really help. So what happened on this particular occasion this year is that one athlete confronted him. The athlete that was overrun with emotions wanted nothing to do with it. Another athlete stepped right in, literally right next to him. This is not orchestrated. No one knows that this is going to happen ever. Steps right in, grabs his attention. The first athlete wants nothing to do with it. A third person, a fourth and a fifth. They literally lined up. It was this amazing experience. The athlete was so overwhelmed with emotion, he wanted nothing to do with his best friends. And so there\u2019s a picture, an image I have in my mind where one of the athletes is pulling on the said athlete\u2019s hair. Like come on now, get back in here. It was radical. I\u2019m watching going, this is unbelievable. Then, all of a sudden, the entire defensive part of the \u2013 it was almost everybody \u2013 just started jumping, like a tribal experience. Getting them back in a rhythm almost like these large animals that were hunting together and they\u2019re kind of in their tribal moment, and they brought him back into the fold. They met him with the intensity, with the care to say you are one of us, stay with us. It was unbelievable. The leadership to do that, it was Earl Thomas, our safety, was right there. Kam Chancellor, our strong safety, was right there. Bobby Wagner, these men that just showed up to say come on now, let\u2019s go. It was beautiful. It was wonderful. Now, if you have a controlling environment or if you\u2019re afraid of emotions, that could never happen, can\u2019t happen. That\u2019s not okay, it can\u2019t happen. But that\u2019s how far you want to be able to push to the edge, to explore potential. To explore capacity. Those moments, as you\u2019ll well understand that word and appreciate that word, I hope, is that\u2019s a capacity-building moment for everybody involved. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve worked with a number of fighters. The fighting has both the consequences and you have a duration of time, right? You could have puncher\u2019s chance, ten seconds in, somebody gets knocked out. Michael Gervais: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: But you could also have a 15-minute battle on your hands. Michael Gervais: For a championship fight. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. What are some of the most important types of work or practices that you\u2019ve implemented with fighters? Michael Gervais: Again, it doesn\u2019t differ that much from others. I truly believe that \u2013 I have no evidence for what I\u2019m about to say \u2013 but the craft matters less than the ability to access the craft. My approach doesn\u2019t change that much between sport A and sport B. But when there are set consequences, it feels like the needing to want to do the work is amplified. So the person wants to do the work, I want to do the work, so there is more intensity in the work because their ass is on the line. First things first. What is your ideal competitive mindset? How do you talk about it? What does it feel like? Let\u2019s see if we can create that as a target. So that\u2019s the first part of the work is what is it like inside of you when you\u2019re at your best? If you haven\u2019t done that work, that\u2019s a really important thing to be able to do. Because if you don\u2019t do that work, what ends up happening is we get overrun by external stimulus telling us how we should look, how we should think, how we should. That should-ing all over oneself creates shame and smallness. It becomes problematic for express, artistic expression even. The first is like, what is your ideal competitive mindset? The second is, what are the strategies that you employ to turn that on? Once we get to sorting those two things out, then we backfill into we need to increase our awareness of those thoughts, of those circumstances, so that you can dictate that more often. Tim Ferriss: Dictate what? Michael Gervais: The ideal competitive mindset. That\u2019s the fighter\u2019s responsibility. Because it\u2019s dangerous and it\u2019s rugged and it\u2019s real that there\u2019s another human that could do complete damage and change you forever. So we need to know what the ideal competitive mindset is, and then we back into great awareness so that you can pivot and adjust and you\u2019ve got the skills to be able to adjust accordingly to either erroneous thoughts or real consequences that are taking place. I think that you would recognize that the steps into the cage, those steps if not prepared properly become problematic for people. Tough on the concrete and some people, as soon as they get into the cage, it\u2019s a different experience. Some people light up as soon as they\u2019re in there. No work is needed. It\u2019s amazing. Lights are on, cage door closes, and the grin on their face is the real deal. Tim Ferriss: To give you guys a quick tip that I learned recently, if you want to be less addicted to using your smartphone or whatever it might be, set the screen to grayscale. There\u2019s actually some pretty interesting data to suggest that you\u2019ll use apps in a less compulsive fashion if you change it to a black-and-white screen. If that\u2019s where you want to go. Michael Gervais: Real quickly on that thing, the challenge that we\u2019re having from smartphones is that I\u2019d also say compete. Get around your buddies, your boys, whatever it might be and compete. If you guys go to dinner with whomever, put your cellphones on the table. So when you put your cellphones on the table, it decreases attention. We know that. Put your cellphone on the table and whoever picks that thing up first, they\u2019re paying the bill. So level up on some competition. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s good. I like that. Michael Gervais: So then there\u2019s a consequence to grabbing that thing instead of getting the dopamine and the hit, the rush that we get. The last piece on the external stimulus for our attention. It is deconditioning SOA from being present. Not lost on anyone here. That\u2019s a real problem for the next generation. It really is. I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll figure out ways that they\u2019re going to show us how to be better than we are. I\u2019m nervous because we know that flow state, the most optimal state a human being can be in, flow follows focus. Not just any kind of focus, but deep focus. So think about that for a moment, the gravity of that. If we\u2019re detraining ourselves by multi-tasking and not training deep focus, we\u2019re decreasing our frequency of dropping into flow state, the most optimal state a human can be in. We\u2019ve got problems \u2013 productivity, sense of awe and wonder. Those challenges come around the corner for us. Tim Ferriss: Yes, indeed. Just wait until we\u2019re all wearing VR headsets. That\u2019ll be curious. I suppose this is a decent segue. Jeffrey Neuman, where are you? There we are. \u201cDo you have your own therapist or counselor or other performance coach you turn to personally? If so, what is it they give you in terms of perspective that you can\u2019t give yourself?\u201d Michael Gervais: Why would I need a therapist? No, yes. I\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s a great question. There\u2019s a story that goes with it. Two stories. The first was that going through graduate training, one of the requirements that the school provided was you have to go sit in the other chair. You have to feel what it feels like to understand that level of vulnerability and the process of being authentic and saying difficult things. So that was my first exposure to it. I don\u2019t see myself doing therapy. That\u2019s not what I do. But I\u2019m invested in relationships to strengthen the assets of other people. I sat in that chair, and I was like, wow, this is heavy. It is just sweating in chairs. It\u2019s just another human being asking me questions. I could say no. I could say whatever I want, but I\u2019m sweating with tension. That was my first experience with it. The second was my wife, seven years into our relationship, said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go.\u201d We got married really young; high school sweethearts. We got married really young and we hadn\u2019t found ourselves yet. She said, \u201cI love you. You\u2019re wonderful, but I don\u2019t know how to be me and I don\u2019t know how to be me around you.\u201d The strength to say that. I was in panic mode. I was like, what, who, what do I do? We didn\u2019t talk for some time. I said, \u201cHey, listen,\u201d I was already doing what I do. I said, \u201cHey, listen, let\u2019s go talk to somebody.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cFine.\u201d She\u2019s Latin and she\u2019s wonderful and she says to me with all the flair you can imagine, \u201cBut it\u2019s not gonna work.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So we go to therapy. It wasn\u2019t manufactured. It was real and it was on. I was about to lose something that was so dear and tender to me and that I had created the problem basically, right? It was rad. And yes, yes, yes, if you haven\u2019t done the work yet, get your ass in a chair and be real and sort it out with somebody. It is unbelievable. We dated. We ended up doing that work for two years. We dated. We\u2019ve been married now for 20-something years. It\u2019s rad. It\u2019s rad. I work with adults. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. There\u2019s no trickery. So it has to work from sturdy and robust practices that will test and be weathered in rugged environments. That\u2019s why I say there\u2019s no tricks, there\u2019s no hacks. I don\u2019t know how you feel about hacks because it\u2019s talked about a lot. But I have a reaction to it. There is no shortcut. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I don\u2019t like the word. I don\u2019t like the word. I think it implies too many things to too many people in different ways. It\u2019s nebulous. It can be interpreted in a very expedient, Band-Aid type of fashion in the form of a shortcut. I think looking for elegant, not obvious solutions is interesting. Sometimes those do end up being faster. I don\u2019t like to think of them as hacks. On this point though, with your experience at this conference, the fighters and so on, assuming that the clients (a) are going to do the work \u2013 they\u2019re there and they will do the work; (b) they have the budget. Are there any types of clients you no longer work with? That you say no to? Michael Gervais: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What types? Michael Gervais: People that have incredible influence and have low regard for others. Tim Ferriss: I was wondering why you stopped returning my phone calls. Just kidding. How do you suss those people out? Michael Gervais: It comes out in the first 15 minutes of a phone call. That\u2019s like my screening process is there\u2019s a couple gates to get through for both of us. One is the sniff test for both of us. Like, will you do the work? Does this guy know what he\u2019s talking about? Some questions. I don\u2019t have a set of questions, but it\u2019s an organic feel. Then I\u2019d say I\u2019m probably shooting 85 percent from that first 15-minute conversation. Then when we show up in person, I know almost right away. You can feel that. What I\u2019ve learned in between now is to get, with permission from that person, are there a couple people that I could call to learn a little bit more about you before we make a final decision? Then I\u2019ll make a couple calls and do some due diligence. It feels awful to take money from somebody who had incredible influence and is going to harm other people, not for a noble cause. Not for something that\u2019s right. So if people are A-holes and they want to be more powerful, it doesn\u2019t feel good. Tim Ferriss: Just on a process standpoint, one thing I\u2019m really interested in is if the person who wants to work with you is giving you three names, it\u2019s kind of like interviewing anyone for a job, they\u2019re going to give you references who are going to say nice things, generally. So you\u2019re going into it knowing that these people are probably going to want to praise. Michael Gervais: They don\u2019t know why I\u2019m asking though. They don\u2019t know why I\u2019m asking. They don\u2019t know if I\u2019m trying to suss out if they\u2019re a jerk or not or have low regard for other humans. Tim Ferriss: No understanding? Michael Gervais: Right. Now they do. Tim Ferriss: Now they do. Don\u2019t worry. Michael Gervais: No one\u2019s watching. Tim Ferriss: No one\u2019s watching; it\u2019s just us. It brought to mind an approach that I thought was very clever. I\u2019m going to ask about your questions, what you do on the phone. A very clever approach that I heard from someone who is in charge of hiring at a fast-growing company. They knew, at least in the State of California, you can get yourself in a lot of trouble as a reference if you start [inaudible] someone. It can come back at you in a really nasty legal way. How do you get someone to admit that the person they\u2019re supposed to be a reference for isn\u2019t a 10 out of 10? So what this person would do is they would just call and they would deliberately call at a time they\u2019d get voicemail and they would say \u2013 \u201cIf this person is a 10 out of 10 and you would recommend them with all their heart, call me back.\u201d If they didn\u2019t get a call back, they got their answer, without the other person incriminating themselves. Michael Gervais: Cool. Tim Ferriss: They had plausible deniability. That\u2019s pretty clever, right? Michael Gervais: That\u2019s good, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So when you call this person, friend of person X, what do you say? What do you ask? Michael Gervais: I just thank them for taking the call. I have a little chitchat about how they know each other. Then I\u2019ll start to feel it out. I don\u2019t have a system for this. It\u2019s a conversation. The things that I do like to think about with them are, have you ever been embarrassed around them? So people will say yes or no or whatever. But it\u2019s the hesitation that\u2019s important in that. So I\u2019m just feeling the hesitation out. I ask them about how they tip. That tells a lot. I ask them, are you going to work with them again in the future? Usually they\u2019re agents or managers or people that they send as a referral. Those are some of the things. It\u2019s just a feel. I don\u2019t know how to do it more systematically over the phone. I\u2019m not in the hiring game, so I\u2019m not as good at that. It\u2019s like a screening, I would say is the way I use it. Tim Ferriss: So tipping? I worked in restaurants for a long time. What are your rules for tipping? What\u2019s your system? I have one. What\u2019s yours? Michael Gervais: I just kind of do the same thing unless they\u2019re exceptional or awful. So it\u2019s 20 percent and that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ll do for everyone. If they\u2019re exceptional, what does that mean? It\u2019s like it just feels good to be at dinner. Like they\u2019ve somehow created to the environment and the experience of joy with people and food. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. Right down the middle, most people aren\u2019t exceptional at their jobs, which I think is a bold statement, but I think that\u2019s accurate. So 20 percent, thank you, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s fine. Then the other experience when people are awful, I don\u2019t want to leave anything. It\u2019s really aggressive, but I usually tell people. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m very similar. I mean, having worked in hard restaurant environments and busted my ass to earn tips, I\u2019m just like, \u201cDude, you\u2019re just mailing it in. You\u2019re not even trying.\u201d Michael Gervais: So, Robert, the reason I wanted somebody to read is because I would bet \u2013 what I wanted to ask you, did your heart rate come up just asking a simple, little question? Yeah. So how many of you \u2013 can I do this? Tim Ferriss: Go for it. Michael Gervais: How many of you here have a philosophy that you could say in 20 words or less? Hands up. That\u2019s not enough. That is not enough. How many of you could come down and say it with Tim and I right now. We got some bold ones. Good, yeah. Tim Ferriss: We got some self-selection going on coming to the show. Michael Gervais: And then, for Robert, how many of you have those experiences where just saying your name at a table of strangers, your heart starts to pound? Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s interesting. Michael Gervais: Right? So those are great moments because it\u2019s teaching you something about your psychological framework. That what they think of you is now too important because your body is saying, \u201cIs this a sabretooth?\u201d That\u2019s why that system\u2019s turned on. Or \u201cIs this some other kind of threat that I don\u2019t know what to do with?\u201d Those are great moments. As often as we can find those moments to put ourselves in, that\u2019s how we build capacity to be able to one day express artistically. Tim Ferriss: Capacity is a really important term. I want to build on a few things that you said. The first about the mindfulness, the present state awareness, my experience \u2013 I live in San Francisco. People are always on their phones. L.A. has a different thing. This isn\u2019t everybody, but I had this experience. I went to a party and this woman had just moved to L.A. and she said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really difficult here because people will be talking to you and looking over each shoulder; looking for a bigger and better option.\u201d Somebody who\u2019s walking around. I was at this party and my phone had died and I was also a drinking a fair number of gin and sodas. I was talking to people and they\u2019re like, \u201cI feel like you\u2019re really listening to me.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, because I\u2019m just looking into your eyes and listening to you.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take much. It was like a super power. It was unbelievable. The bar right now is pretty low in general. (A) It doesn\u2019t necessarily take a lot of work; (B) this piece on when did being on stage and worrying about people think become a threat? I think it ties in very nicely to something you mentioned earlier, which is this systematic desensitization. Not to totally nerd out, but I will for a second. Stoicism, once again. We have a gent named Cato. Cato was considered by many, including Seneca, to be the perfect Stoic. Now, no one\u2019s perfect, but he lived the principles better than many or most. One of the things Cato would do is routinely purposefully do things that would get him ridiculed. But on a surface level. So he would wear different colored tunic, for instance, than was customary at the time, so that he would get ridiculed by people who were around him. He trained himself to be regularly not embarrassed or to condition himself to not be embarrassed so that he could reserve being embarrassed for only those things that are worth being embarrassed about. In doing so, he became very emboldened to share popular opinions because he built up that tolerance. Just like building up a base tan going into the sun. You can\u2019t just jump out for two hours in the sun, looking as pale as I do especially, and expect that mind over matter you\u2019re suddenly going to tan really well. You\u2019re going to get turned into a lobster. Psychologically, the same thing is true. You can train yourself. I have these pants, I\u2019m not wearing them right now, I call them party pants. They\u2019re the most disgusting, ugly, floral pattern, Grandma couch pants you\u2019ve ever seen. I have a few things that I do like that, borrowed from somebody who lived more than 2,000 years ago, that are just as applicable today. That\u2019s also something you can regularly train. Michael Gervais: It\u2019s really important, I think, to honor that the same way you can train your body, you can train your mind. Systematically desensitizing yourself to what other people think of you at a surface level? Fantastic. Brilliant. Many of the concepts that we would talk about are not new. Grandma told them to you. Science will back them up in some kind of way, but they\u2019ve been practiced for thousands of years. The science is nice because you don\u2019t have to rely on story-telling. You can rely on some evidence or theoretical evidence at least. Tim Ferriss: The next question is from Facebook. This is from Jimmy Suta. Michael Gervais: What\u2019s up, Jimmy? Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s up, Jimmy? Ask what techniques they use when visualizing \u2013 dark room and music? Do they meditate? Hypnosis? What are best practices for visualization? Michael Gervais: Let\u2019s use the word, instead of visualization, use the word imagery. Visualization is just with one sense. Imagery conjures up the idea that we\u2019re going to light up our brain with as many senses as we can. Is the question where? Is that the question? Tim Ferriss: It seems to be across the board. Should I do it when it\u2019s light out? In a dark room? Should I wear an eye mask? Listen to music or no music? Silence? I think just the general guidelines. Michael Gervais: The answer would be to play with it. The science is not great for imagery, but the practice is pretty well understood. Music or no music, let\u2019s address that. My experience has been better with no music. Some athletes like music. I feel like it\u2019s a distraction to the objective. The objective is to create such a lifelike experience that your body believes that it could be real and it might just be. So there\u2019s a switching on or an animation that happens within you when you create an image that is crisp and has color and sound and smell and taste. You can manipulate it in such a way that you\u2019re putting yourself in an electrically charging situation. That\u2019s imagery in a nutshell. Can you be so skilled? That takes time to activate those senses. It\u2019s relatively easy to do color. It\u2019s much harder to have color and control it and move it. Can you add the other variables of the other senses on top of it as you go? Again, this is a skill of focus as well. So when your mind wanders, can you refocus? Again, there\u2019s a stitching to mindfulness in here, but the aim is different. Mindfulness is about insight and wisdom. The aim of imagery is enhanced performance. They\u2019re different in that vector. What else would you want to know about it? Like we all know it works. Why don\u2019t we do it more often is the question. Tim Ferriss: I never really put this together before, but one thing that struck me is that perhaps one way to train that ability, given how you defined it using imagery, would be something that fascinated me \u2013 still fascinates me, in fact \u2013 fascinated me for a very long time. That was training yourself to use mnemonic devices. For instance, there\u2019s something called the memory palace. It\u2019s also been called the loci technique. Cicero used it. Many people in the Roman Senate used it to memorize long speeches, where you\u2019re taking objects and placing them in a familiar location. Great book that talks about memory athlete competitions, specifically. Called Moonwalking with Einstein. It features a friend of mine named Ed Cook, who trained somebody in a year to go from nothing to national memory champion. It\u2019s incredible to look at how this works. But it\u2019s embracing and learning to manipulate all the things you just mentioned, with a very clear objective and also a reward. So you can do things like learn to memorize the serial numbers on five different bills someone gives you and then two weeks later you could give those serial numbers to them, indicating which bill it was on, like a $5, a $10 or a $20. Or do them backwards. You can train yourself to do that in two or three days. That could be interesting for people to pursue, potentially. If you\u2019re nerdy and you like that kind of stuff. Michael Gervais: I want to go back to fighting and imagery for just a moment and stitch those two concepts together. Rickson Gracie? Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Michael Gervais: Rickson Gracie is a legend in the fight world. He and I did an interview probably 15 years ago, where I was asking him about imagery. With a partner, I was creating The Champion Mind Fighter DVD. It was back when those DVDs \u2013 this is before it was on Spike TV, before it was a thing. It was always a thing to fighters. I asked him about imagery. \u201cDo you do it?\u201d He says, \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He says, \u201cI do it.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d He just kind of gathers himself and he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful movie and every time I relive it, I create images and nuances that I want to experience. So he called it \u2013 think about the care that you would have that you will spend time to enhance your imagination and use your imagination to create the most beautiful movie. That tells you something about the way he\u2019s fundamentally orientated his life. Just doing a couple interviews here and there or, I don\u2019t know, four days before you\u2019re going to go give a speech? That\u2019s not enough. That\u2019s a hack. That\u2019s taking good science, but not really living it. Tim Ferriss: When you think of the word \u201csuccessful,\u201d who or what is the first thing that comes to mind? Michael Gervais: I think about success as a life of inner peace. A life that has meaning and is adding to the wellness of the global community. That\u2019s how I think about it. I could pull out the word \u201cglobal\u201d and make that not necessarily the world, but one\u2019s own ecosystem, like the family unit. So a sense of peace, exploring the giving and making something better than you left it. There\u2019s a gentleman by the name of Jon Kabat-Zinn. Tim Ferriss: \u201cWherever you go, there you are.\u201d Is that it? Michael Gervais: What\u2019s up, Jon? Yeah, he\u2019s unbelievable. I don\u2019t know him the way that it might sound I know him, but I feel like I feel him and I understand him and I love what he stands for. I love how I feel around him. He has done a tremendous gift to modern times to embrace the science of mindfulness. I think he has an inner peace about him and he\u2019s worked at it. I think he is a person who encapsulates it the best for me. Tim Ferriss: You mention an author that I\u2019m fond of. Are there any books that you\u2019ve given most as gifts? If you give books as gifts. Michael Gervais: Yeah, I do. I like to give poems. On one page with great writing, there\u2019s so much in there. Tim Ferriss: What types of poets or poetry? Michael Gervais: One of my favorites is Oriah Mountain Dreamer. Tim Ferriss: Oriah. Michael Gervais: Oriah Mountain Dreamer. Tim Ferriss: How do you spell Oriah? Michael Gervais: O-R-I-A-H, Mountain Dreamer. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Michael Gervais: Just beautiful prose. That\u2019s one. \u201cI am me\u201d by Virginia Satir. That\u2019s pretty powerful as well. And then the book I think I spend a lot of time gifting is \u2013 it\u2019s a great applied book \u2013 Jerry Lynch wrote it with a co-author. It\u2019s called The Way of the Champion. Tim Ferriss: The Way of the Champion. Michael Gervais: Yeah, very applied. Meets me right where, at the most simple concept. It\u2019s a book that you do, rather than just read. It\u2019s great. I pass it out like it\u2019s candy in locker rooms. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any favorite movies or documentaries? Michael Gervais: I love documentaries. I really do. I think documentaries \u2013 I\u2019m much more interested in non-fiction than fiction; just the way that I think about things. I can\u2019t remember a documentary that I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a bad documentary.\u201d Because usually people that are shooting documentaries love it too. It comes through the work. It translates some kind of way. I love documentaries. Favorite movie? Star Wars. I was captivated by it when I was eight. It just kind of keeps coming back to me. But as far as titles of documentaries? You know what was good was Amy. Tim Ferriss: Amy? That was very good. Michael Gervais: It was really good. The beauty and tragedy of an artistic genius. Tim Ferriss: So heart-wrenching. Michael Gervais: That was captivating. Tim Ferriss: If I say $100 or less purchase that has significantly, positively impacted your life, does anything come to mind? It doesn\u2019t have to be recent, but it could be recent. Michael Gervais: Yeah, two things pop up. One is this $11.99 book that my wife bought my son and he won\u2019t put it down. I have an eight-year-old son. What\u2019s up, Grayson? Any little book that I give my son feels like the greatest gift in the world because he becomes mesmerized by the imagination and the stories inside of it. That\u2019s been really good. Tim Ferriss: Do you remember the title? Michael Gervais: It\u2019s something about Pok\u00e9mon. I think it\u2019s the something-Pok\u00e9mon whatever. He\u2019s all about it. So that\u2019s been really good. Then I\u2019d say not for my would be soft tissue work. Tim Ferriss: Soft tissue work. Michael Gervais: Massage and soft tissue work. I think it\u2019s an incredible gift for all of us, for alignment. If you feel tension in your muscular system. Tim Ferriss: If you had to give a TED Talk or just a very high-profile 20-minute speech on nothing that you\u2019re known for, nothing you\u2019ve spoken on before? It could be a weekend obsession, it could be Star Wars. But what would you choose? Michael Gervais: What kind of question is that? Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a curveball question. Michael Gervais: Yeah. What are \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Where are we trying to go with that? Michael Gervais: Yeah, what are we trying to sort out? Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re not trying to sort out anything in particular. I\u2019m not solving climate change here. I\u2019ll tell you where this comes from. Where it comes from is I was having a conversation with a gentleman named Marc Andreessen. Marc Andreessen created the first popular graphical web browser or co-authored it. Mosaic. He is a serial billionaire. One of the most successful investors on the planet. An incredible writer. The guy\u2019s a real polymath. One of the many ways that he finds opportunities is he asks what are the nerds doing on the weekends or in the evenings? What are they spending their time on? Michael Gervais: Did you just call me a nerd? Tim Ferriss: No. Although that would be a compliment. You did just mention Star Wars. I mean, let\u2019s be fair. Michael Gervais: And Pok\u00e9mon. Tim Ferriss: And Pok\u00e9mon. So what I\u2019m trying to suss out is any side obsessions that you have. Michael Gervais: I don\u2019t think I have a great answer for that. Like what do I think \u2013 surfing would be the thing that I try to fit in the best way I possibly can, which is tough to do. Would I give a talk on surfing? Probably not. I don\u2019t know. I spend so much time thinking about the human experience, it would have to be something outside of the human experience. So I don\u2019t know where to go. Tim Ferriss: Well here, I\u2019ll give you one. What is the hardest challenge that you are currently working on yourself? Michael Gervais: Hardest challenge? I think it\u2019s always authenticity. I think that\u2019s always it. Then moving as deep as I can to places that are uncomfortable. What would that be? It\u2019s saying the thing that I find difficult to say because it requires this fear that I have that if I say this thing that I feel like is true and pure, and it hurts another person, then that tension becomes really challenging in the relationship. I\u2019m significantly better because I practice a lot, but that thing is, I think, really hard for people. For me, I should say. That would be one of them. And then business. I\u2019m building a business right now with Coach Carroll and figuring out entrepreneurship in that frame. Tim Ferriss: Is this Win Forever? Michael Gervais: Yeah. This is a consulting model where we have taken his intellectual property and mine \u2013 his on culture building and mine on mindset training \u2013 and put them together where we think we\u2019ve captured and we\u2019re on to something about how to share that with people that are not in sport. It\u2019s landing in the business world on how to shape cultures that are meaningful and then train the people, really the capital inside of our workforces, to be their very best. That sounds wonderful. How do you actually create a business that has scale and meaning? I love it. It\u2019s hard, but I love it. Tim Ferriss: That is a challenge. What is the worst advice that you hear often in your field? I\u2019ll let you define field however you want. Michael Gervais: The field would be squarely within psychology, in the facets of human performance, that\u2019s the field. Particularly from the invisible standpoint. But the worst advice is advice. That\u2019s it. Advice is awful. It\u2019s just like saying stuff that \u2013 you should, why don\u2019t you, how come, that\u2019s what you should do. That\u2019s the stuff. But I\u2019d say more specifically than the general answer would be that you too can be everything you want to be. Not necessarily. Maybe in some kind of make-believe world that everybody is going to be amazing. I don\u2019t see people putting in the work to do it. Motivation? I don\u2019t know anything about it. I don\u2019t know anything about motivation because the people I work with don\u2019t need it. They\u2019re driven. They\u2019re fully committed to a particular way of living. So this idea that we need motivation? We don\u2019t need motivation. We need to find ourselves and what is true and honest. When it matters to us? I know this to be true for me, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes. I think that\u2019s what we want to help people find. That stuff. Sorry for a little soapbox moment there. Tim Ferriss: Soapbox on. Do you have \u2013 and I\u2019ll explain what this means \u2013 do you have any favorite failures? What I mean by that is a failure or failures that in hindsight actually set you up for future successes. I know we\u2019ve talked about how we can semantically drill down on that, but I think you get what I mean. Michael Gervais: Yeah. I think I\u2019ve shared them with you already, which is the love of my life saying that this isn\u2019t working anymore. Both of us co-created that relationship. But that was unbelievably painful to go through that journey. So many of us have done it. That was what was an incredible gift of strength that she demonstrated for me and for us. I think that was a big one. I was an absolute selfish, craft-obsessed human being that was not watering and loving properly the people that mattered the most. That thing is real. That\u2019s an incredible gift. Fundamentally altered in my life. Tim Ferriss: Excluding that \u2013 this is leading to the next question \u2013 what is one of the most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made? I\u2019ll explain what I mean by that. It could be money, time, energy, anything else. I\u2019ll give you an example. There\u2019s a woman named Amelia Boone. She\u2019s the most decorated obstacle course racer of all time. Three-time World\u2019s Toughest Mudder Champion. Just an incredible athlete. Her answer was, the $450.00 for her first entrance fee into one of these competitions. It was a real stretch for her at the time, but having taken that step, it opened up an entire world of possibility for her. What would your answer or one of your answers be? Michael Gervais: What was the first question? Tim Ferriss: One of the most worthwhile investments of time, energy, [inaudible]. Michael Gervais: Time is all we get. That is what we\u2019re competing for and with right now. It\u2019s the greatest thing we\u2019re trying to suss out, I think, is how can we be here now? So the easy one is time. Investment in understanding how to be here now and be on time, I feel like is the gift that I\u2019m trying to help others find as well. But more concretely, there was a moment when I had just graduated my Ph.D. program and there was one of two ways that I could go. The two ways \u2013 one was I could get licensed and the other was I could not get licensed. So licensed as a psychologist means that you\u2019ve gotten certain privileges and restrictions, but you are part of the club that can do psychological services and medical services. I had a moment when I was back to when I was really young. If I don\u2019t take the test \u2013 I had all these reasons \u2013 if I don\u2019t go get licensed, I\u2019ll be able to build a business and I\u2019ll be fine. Because you don\u2019t have to be licensed to do some of the work that we\u2019re talking about. But so it was like this personal decision. Do I go and get tested or do I not? It was one of these really cool moments where I was like, you know what? I\u2019m letting it rip. I can remember getting the results back. I was in the first home that I bought with my wife and getting that thing back and the results back after six weeks of waiting, I was jumping up and down. That was a moment of test that was meaningful for me and it created a lot of freedom for other tests. Tim Ferriss: After all of your experiences with the SATs and so on and hating tests, what was the self-talk to make that decision? Michael Gervais: To go for that test? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Michael Gervais: I would be a phony. I really did want it. This goes back to surfing. I really did want it, but I couldn\u2019t do it. I was afraid to do it. I was afraid to put myself out there to not be good enough. That was the model that others were going to determine if I was good enough. So I was right on the cusp of it during this test-taking thing. I could go and build a business the other way, or I could go and get tested. It was really just for me. Tim Ferriss: So being honest with yourself? Michael Gervais: Yeah, I was being honest. Tim Ferriss: Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr. Michael Gervais. Michael Gervais: All right. Thank you, guys.

ran through", "but yeah, so we moved down to southern california", "i didn\u2019t want to go", "i wasn\u2019t into it", "where i was growing up at the time, i was having just a lot of fun with motocross and motorcycle and bmx and just loving that type of stuff up in northern california", "it was the right move for the family", "they dragged me along with them", "then there i am in southern california", "i know that there\u2019s that story that i hear often from some of the best in the world that they knew at an early age that they wanted to do fill-in-the-blanks", "whether it\u2019s music or sports or art or business", "i didn\u2019t have that", "i was really more interested in today and figuring out how to do today the best way i possibly could, as a 6-year old and a 16-year old", "no one in my family went to college", "i didn\u2019t know anyone that went to college", "i didn\u2019t", "if they did, they didn\u2019t talk about", "i certainly didn\u2019t know anyone that had a graduate degree", "were you good in school", "no", "the assistant principal, the dean of my high school, pulled my then-girlfriend, now-wife, cool story, pulled her aside and said, \u201cwhat is a nice girl like you dating gervais?\u201d kind of heavy in school the way that went down", "but that was an indication that i was not on the right path", "i didn\u2019t have a structure to really help me get the right path", "i learned a lot the hard way", "i had no idea that there was even this profession about being able to give back through understanding how the mind works", "that\u2019s how my journey began", "so if you were to teach any class or mandate, this is a better question, mandate certain types of experiences for, it could be high school students or, in this case, college students", "what might they be or mandatory classes", "if i could create a class that was mandatory for incoming freshmen or whatever", "yeah", "yeah", "it would be dangerous", "for sure, we are raising children that are \u2013 i don\u2019t know how old you are \u2013 39", "yeah, so you grew up probably kind of with a seatbelt, but not always maybe", "mostly off leash, just like faceplanting skateboarding down hills and stuff like that", "our generation right now is every one of them grew up with instant access to whatever and everyone\u2019s buckled in safety harnesses from the beginnings of their life", "we don\u2019t have a real appreciation for danger", "so we pompously walk around with a soft underbelly thinking that we understand what\u2019s true and real and beautiful and hard and honest", "it\u2019s the rugged and hostile environments that teach us", "they teach us by leveraging real fear", "we say that we conquer fear", "we say that we\u2019ll do things", "but not until you\u2019re squarely facing it down does the risk of putting yourself in that situation provide insight", "but that class would be too dangerous for modern times", "like there would be stuff that possibly people would get hurt, which would make it real and maybe somebody loses limbs or life or something, which makes it real", "because this bubble that we live in is problematic for the next generation", "i agree with that", "lord of the flies 101", "no, i agree", "i couldn\u2019t agree more", "i had someone ask me recently in q&a, they said, \u201chave you ever thought about doing a summer camp for adults?\u201d i said, \u201cwell, kind of occasionally maybe after too much wine thought about it.\u201d they\u2019re like, \u201cwell, what would you have everyone do?\u201d i\u2019d be like, \u201cit would be mostly suffering", "you would definitely exercised until you vomited.\u201d all the hands go down", "but yeah, definitely undervalued", "it\u2019s thought of as a negative thing, but it\u2019s a tool and a teacher", "when was the first time when you felt like you had made a huge mistake or failed someone", "it doesn\u2019t have to be the first time", "the first time that comes to mind", "the first one that comes to mind will remain nameless for sure, but it was an entertainer that i just couldn\u2019t quite reach", "it was hard", "it was deep and it was rich", "she made it", "she survived, but i wasn\u2019t able to do what i had hoped we would do", "it\u2019s those kind of haunting experiences", "that one\u2019s not haunting, but i knew that i can\u2019t connect in the way \u2013 i can\u2019t access the depth and the richness that i need to go to because i have limitations of what i was able to do at that time", "what were the limitations", "she could go deeper than i could go", "in what respect", "authenticity", "to talk about the real stuff", "so here\u2019s the full circle of the conversation", "before i finish that story, i don\u2019t think about failure that way though", "failure is not making a mistake; that\u2019s not failure", "failure is not being authentic", "failure is not going for it", "failure is being small", "whether you win or not, if you\u2019re authentically you and you go for it", "okay, it sounds easy", "it sounds like you could put that in a fortune cookie, but that\u2019s really what it\u2019s about", "so when you play it safe and small and you\u2019re not authentically yourself, it\u2019s your whole day is failing", "your whole month, your whole year", "i don\u2019t think about it like that\u2019s a win, that\u2019s a loss, that\u2019s a failure, that\u2019s a mistake, that\u2019s good, that\u2019s bad", "the experience is a day-to-day orientation to try to pivot and grow", "it\u2019s relentless and it\u2019s hard and it\u2019s difficult", "back to this experience is that when i reshape how we think about failure, it really is about \u2013 no, let me, i think i finished that", "when we talk about the emotional piece, is that if we can hold our ability to be authentically ourselves when it\u2019s difficult and that\u2019s only emotional", "we use physical whatever to get to the emotional", "there\u2019s no mental difficultyness, there\u2019s no such thing", "because they\u2019re just words, right", "it\u2019s the emotional thing that\u2019s the hardest for us", "so if we can hold presence, this is the gift to give another person", "if we can hold presence when another person is rattling and they\u2019re a wreck, you\u2019re there for them in a really cool way", "but if you can\u2019t go deep enough to be able to hold true and to be authentic with them, then they don\u2019t trust you", "they take care of themselves and the work is not real", "in that case, when you\u2019re having difficulty going as deep as she went, was it not having enough present state awareness so she could tell you weren\u2019t truly paying attention", "was it not asking the harder questions", "i was overwhelmed and so i couldn\u2019t be there authentically for another person", "that is the essence of what love is", "how did that manifest", "if you and i are having this conversation and you\u2019re checking your phone \u2013 i\u2019ll be dramatic, you\u2019re checking your phone, you\u2019re looking at your watch, you\u2019re checking to see if we\u2019re okay, you\u2019re checking out \u2013 because this is not interesting", "then i\u2019m going to be like f this", "this sucks", "so that\u2019s one level of it", "it happens every day, all day long, every airport that i\u2019m in", "that\u2019s what\u2019s happening", "deeper than that is if he or she is saying something and they\u2019re trying to see if they can go for it and i\u2019m missing it \u2013 people all the time will tell you who they are", "you just have to listen", "you have to be really present with them to hear the essence of what they\u2019re trying to communicate underneath the boy meets girl", "there\u2019s romeo and juliet in every story, but we have to look for it, which is the emotional, gripping, true experience that people are wanting to sort out", "so you have to get under there to do it", "if i miss the lob that the person\u2019s giving, they\u2019re out", "so that\u2019s kind of how relationships work", "it was on the half yard line", "it was a roller coaster of a third and fourth quarter", "tom brady on the other side and that team, they did a phenomenal job", "they did a phenomenal job", "they\u2019re skilled, very skilled", "so here it is on the half yard line", "the entire stadium thought the ball was going to go to our running back \u2013 exceptional running back marshawn lynch", "bill belichick \u2013 mind you, the intensity of trying to sort out what the next play is while the clock is going down, while there\u2019s an emotional stimulation that\u2019s taking place, is not an easy thing to do", "that\u2019s a very complicated thing", "when the environment is losing their minds, be clear about what the options are", "bill belichick brings in his men to stop the running game", "the coaches are like \u2013 because we brought in a particular unit that was just a beautiful play and it was a pass play", "so i could see the coaches go, that\u2019s the match-up you want", "that\u2019s the exact match-up", "there\u2019s another thing about this match-up is that the seattle seahawks are 20 percent from running from the goal line", "as a general rule, we want to put people and organizations in positions of strength, not roll the dice on positions of weakness, right", "so being 20% from the goal line, those are not great odds", "so they\u2019re matching up for the run, here we are trying to get to a pass play and the ball\u2019s intercepted and game\u2019s over", "what was happening on the sideline before that is that we were ahead of time", "the sidelines, not the men out here", "but the sidelines were ahead of time", "what do you mean by that", "if you think about music, music is benefit when it\u2019s on time", "even if there\u2019s some dissonance, but when it\u2019s on time", "ahead of time is that syncopation creates chaos", "so we were on the sidelines because we weren\u2019t in the game, ahead of time", "ohmygod, we\u2019re winning the game", "this is it", "and then all of a sudden, we thought it was ours", "now i\u2019m speaking about me, really", "i was ahead of time", "and the ball\u2019s intercepted", "the game\u2019s done", "that team storms the field", "what was it", "blue and silver tickertape is coming down", "our sideline was stunned", "the emotions in the locker room afterwards, was the most intense environment i\u2019ve ever been in that didn\u2019t have real violence", "yearning and searching and questioning why was, on a scale of 1 to 10, 100", "anger and just being pissed off about what just happened because the loss \u2013 our brain is phenomenal as you well understand, but there\u2019s no redundancy in the brain, so the circuitry for grief and loss is the same circuitry for losing a game", "so it was grief", "it was the most intense grief, like somebody just came in at the last moment and took away everything that you thought was yours", "it was exciting, it\u2019s a thing you\u2019ve worked your whole life for", "so coming into that locker room, there was 6\u20198\u201d crying, 6\u20194\u201d ready to break someone\u2019s head open, 6\u20192\u201d was taking off his tape, ready to punch somebody", "there was a person behind me that was screaming, \u201cwhy", "why is this happening?!!!\u201d there was another gentleman, another athlete in the back that was kind of snickering and laughing", "and then there was plenty of people that were just completely overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know what to feel", "what are, and i\u2019ll give a personal example here, maybe some baby steps, remedial approaches that people can take if they\u2019ve had a hard time or suspect they would", "in my case, i found the gateway drug to get me moving in the right direction was guided meditations", "so listening to tara brach or sam harris or someone else", "basically every couple of seconds, just like, \u201chey, idiot.\u201d come on back", "\u201cyou\u2019re thinking about porn or your to-do list", "come back.\u201d in addition to that, i found a few apps like headspace to be very helpful", "but the thing that actually helped me to break through, and it\u2019s maybe embarrassing in a way to admit this, was social accountability", "so i actually did take a course", "in this case, it was transcendental meditation", "but i knew that if i didn\u2019t meditate, i would have to go to the session the next day", "and there was an hour set aside for me to talk about my two sessions, and i would just feel like an ass", "and i also paid for it", "so those are a few of the crutches that i used early on to get to the point where i had enough sessions under my belt that it became like brushing my teeth on some level", "at some point, i became obsessed with bhutan", "why on earth would i become obsessed with bhutan", "well, there\u2019s this very romanticized story of gross national happiness and the happiest country in the world and so on", "well, one year they got overtaken in a poll by the danes", "so the danish are now the happiest people in the world", "i\u2019m like, the danish", "okay", "so i at one point ended up going to denmark", "i was like, \u201care you aware that you\u2019re supposedly the happiest people in the world?\u201d the guy was like, huh, drinking his beer", "i said, \u201cwhy do you think that is?\u201d he goes, \u201clow expectations.\u201d it\u2019s easy to dismiss that and go like haha, but then i was like, no, there\u2019s actually something there", "in my mind, if i sat down and meditated and i wasn\u2019t on point, like 90+ percent of the time \u2013 i was thinking of it as almost in terms of school grades \u2013 i was failing", "i was losing", "because you weren\u2019t quiet", "yeah, i wasn\u2019t doing my job", "i wasn\u2019t following the script", "and i was having a conversation with tara brach, this very well-known buddhist and meditation teacher", "she has great talks that she gives regularly and they\u2019re recorded", "i explained this", "i was like, \u201ci could go from sitting down for 20 minutes or roughly 20 minutes,\u201d sort of what i do in the morning when i can, which is most days", "i said, \u201ci could spend 19 minutes thinking about some cartoon i watched when i was a kid, like thundercats", "for 19 minutes", "and then i\u2019ll be like, ferriss, you\u2019ve spent 19 minutes thinking about thundercats!\u201d then i\u2019ll come back", "she says, \u201cthat\u2019s a successful session.\u201d because the training isn\u2019t getting it right, it\u2019s the coming back", "the coming back is the rep", "i was like, oh, okay", "as soon as i thought of it in those terms, suddenly i was having successful sessions and i was able to stick with it", "the misconception is the first trap", "if you just focus on your breathing \u2013 there\u2019s two types of mindfulness training, the way that i\u2019ve come to learn about it: single point and contemplative", "so single point is one thing over and over and over again so you notice when you leave that moment", "then the work is to come back", "once you become aware that you\u2019ve shifted from now, the breath of the dot on the wall or a mantra, whatever it might be, and you\u2019re over here, what do you do with that", "do you say mother\u2013 or do you say \u2013 i want you to curse so bad", "come on back", "don\u2019t do it", "it\u2019s a trap", "do you come back", "can you swiftly come back", "can you do that 1,000 times", "that\u2019s the work", "and then eventually, you\u2019ll slip into that no-minds experience", "i\u2019ll tell you my first teach, he said, \u201cmike.\u201d mind you, i don\u2019t know how old i am, i was young", "but he says, \u201cif you knew what i knew, you\u2019d be doing this every day.\u201d i said, \u201cokay, what do you mean?\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s like a full-body orgasm.\u201d that\u2019s the way you sell it", "yeah, that\u2019s how you sell it", "oh, now you\u2019ve got my attention", "i\u2019m still waiting, so maybe he sold me a bill of goods", "i think you just solved a major branding problem for mindfulness", "you\u2019ve just got to sell it as full-body orgasm and you\u2019ll have people around the block", "let\u2019s take a left turn", "you mentioned the importance of fighting earlier", "i\u2019m taking it out of context, but it brings me back to the seahawks insomuch as i\u2019ve heard, and this is not as someone who knows a lot about football, but that the seahawk organization allows their players to resolve conflicts, to sort out their differences on the sidelines, amongst themselves on a regular basis", "i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true", "this is just something i\u2019ve heard", "is that true", "the statement was that the seahawks allow athletes to work out their conflicts", "yeah, if there\u2019s a conflict between players", "i think it was recently there was \u2013 i\u2019ll unpack the story surrounding it", "this is just me repeating something i heard", "so go back to the principle that coach carroll set up that this is a relationship-based organization", "when relationships matter, there\u2019s intensity around emotions", "what happened just recently, this year, one athlete was angry", "he was pissed", "he threw his helmet", "he was in a fit of rage", "there\u2019s a couple courses that would take place, a couple predictable things that could take place", "people would be like, whoa, that\u2019s too much now, stay away", "or they can come up and become aggressive with him and jump in his face and say that\u2019s not okay", "what most people do in most organizations when somebody\u2019s raging, and i mean raging, full of testosterone and strength, is that they back up because it\u2019s dangerous for them", "even though destruction is taking place", "when one person \u2013 football is a beautiful team environment", "when one person\u2019s off, the whole thing is working to try to help that person", "that\u2019s what teams and tribes do", "they really help", "so what happened on this particular occasion this year is that one athlete confronted him", "the athlete that was overrun with emotions wanted nothing to do with it", "another athlete stepped right in, literally right next to him", "this is not orchestrated", "no one knows that this is going to happen ever", "steps right in, grabs his attention", "the first athlete wants nothing to do with it", "a third person, a fourth and a fifth", "they literally lined up", "it was this amazing experience", "the athlete was so overwhelmed with emotion, he wanted nothing to do with his best friends", "and so there\u2019s a picture, an image i have in my mind where one of the athletes is pulling on the said athlete\u2019s hair", "like come on now, get back in here", "it was radical", "i\u2019m watching going, this is unbelievable", "then, all of a sudden, the entire defensive part of the \u2013 it was almost everybody \u2013 just started jumping, like a tribal experience", "getting them back in a rhythm almost like these large animals that were hunting together and they\u2019re kind of in their tribal moment, and they brought him back into the fold", "they met him with the intensity, with the care to say you are one of us, stay with us", "it was unbelievable", "the leadership to do that, it was earl thomas, our safety, was right there", "kam chancellor, our strong safety, was right there", "bobby wagner, these men that just showed up to say come on now, let\u2019s go", "it was beautiful", "it was wonderful", "now, if you have a controlling environment or if you\u2019re afraid of emotions, that could never happen, can\u2019t happen", "that\u2019s not okay, it can\u2019t happen", "but that\u2019s how far you want to be able to push to the edge, to explore potential", "to explore capacity", "those moments, as you\u2019ll well understand that word and appreciate that word, i hope, is that\u2019s a capacity-building moment for everybody involved", "you\u2019ve worked with a number of fighters", "the fighting has both the consequences and you have a duration of time, right", "you could have puncher\u2019s chance, ten seconds in, somebody gets knocked out", "that\u2019s right", "but you could also have a 15-minute battle on your hands", "for a championship fight", "exactly", "what are some of the most important types of work or practices that you\u2019ve implemented with fighters", "again, it doesn\u2019t differ that much from others", "i truly believe that \u2013 i have no evidence for what i\u2019m about to say \u2013 but the craft matters less than the ability to access the craft", "my approach doesn\u2019t change that much between sport a and sport b", "but when there are set consequences, it feels like the needing to want to do the work is amplified", "so the person wants to do the work, i want to do the work, so there is more intensity in the work because their ass is on the line", "first things first", "what is your ideal competitive mindset", "how do you talk about it", "what does it feel like", "let\u2019s see if we can create that as a target", "so that\u2019s the first part of the work is what is it like inside of you when you\u2019re at your best", "if you haven\u2019t done that work, that\u2019s a really important thing to be able to do", "because if you don\u2019t do that work, what ends up happening is we get overrun by external stimulus telling us how we should look, how we should think, how we should", "that should-ing all over oneself creates shame and smallness", "it becomes problematic for express, artistic expression even", "the first is like, what is your ideal competitive mindset", "the second is, what are the strategies that you employ to turn that on", "once we get to sorting those two things out, then we backfill into we need to increase our awareness of those thoughts, of those circumstances, so that you can dictate that more often", "dictate what", "the ideal competitive mindset", "that\u2019s the fighter\u2019s responsibility", "because it\u2019s dangerous and it\u2019s rugged and it\u2019s real that there\u2019s another human that could do complete damage and change you forever", "so we need to know what the ideal competitive mindset is, and then we back into great awareness so that you can pivot and adjust and you\u2019ve got the skills to be able to adjust accordingly to either erroneous thoughts or real consequences that are taking place", "i think that you would recognize that the steps into the cage, those steps if not prepared properly become problematic for people", "tough on the concrete and some people, as soon as they get into the cage, it\u2019s a different experience", "some people light up as soon as they\u2019re in there", "no work is needed", "it\u2019s amazing", "lights are on, cage door closes, and the grin on their face is the real deal", "to give you guys a quick tip that i learned recently, if you want to be less addicted to using your smartphone or whatever it might be, set the screen to grayscale", "there\u2019s actually some pretty interesting data to suggest that you\u2019ll use apps in a less compulsive fashion if you change it to a black-and-white screen", "if that\u2019s where you want to go", "real quickly on that thing, the challenge that we\u2019re having from smartphones is that i\u2019d also say compete", "get around your buddies, your boys, whatever it might be and compete", "if you guys go to dinner with whomever, put your cellphones on the table", "so when you put your cellphones on the table, it decreases attention", "we know that", "put your cellphone on the table and whoever picks that thing up first, they\u2019re paying the bill", "so level up on some competition", "that\u2019s good", "i like that", "so then there\u2019s a consequence to grabbing that thing instead of getting the dopamine and the hit, the rush that we get", "the last piece on the external stimulus for our attention", "it is deconditioning soa from being present", "not lost on anyone here", "that\u2019s a real problem for the next generation", "it really is", "i\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll figure out ways that they\u2019re going to show us how to be better than we are", "i\u2019m nervous because we know that flow state, the most optimal state a human being can be in, flow follows focus", "not just any kind of focus, but deep focus", "so think about that for a moment, the gravity of that", "if we\u2019re detraining ourselves by multi-tasking and not training deep focus, we\u2019re decreasing our frequency of dropping into flow state, the most optimal state a human can be in", "we\u2019ve got problems \u2013 productivity, sense of awe and wonder", "those challenges come around the corner for us", "yes, indeed", "just wait until we\u2019re all wearing vr headsets", "that\u2019ll be curious", "i suppose this is a decent segue", "jeffrey neuman, where are you", "there we are", "\u201cdo you have your own therapist or counselor or other performance coach you turn to personally", "if so, what is it they give you in terms of perspective that you can\u2019t give yourself?\u201d why would i need a therapist", "no, yes", "i\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s a great question", "there\u2019s a story that goes with it", "two stories", "the first was that going through graduate training, one of the requirements that the school provided was you have to go sit in the other chair", "you have to feel what it feels like to understand that level of vulnerability and the process of being authentic and saying difficult things", "so that was my first exposure to it", "i don\u2019t see myself doing therapy", "that\u2019s not what i do", "but i\u2019m invested in relationships to strengthen the assets of other people", "i sat in that chair, and i was like, wow, this is heavy", "it is just sweating in chairs", "it\u2019s just another human being asking me questions", "i could say no", "i could say whatever i want, but i\u2019m sweating with tension", "that was my first experience with it", "the second was my wife, seven years into our relationship, said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to go.\u201d we got married really young; high school sweethearts", "we got married really young and we hadn\u2019t found ourselves yet", "she said, \u201ci love you", "you\u2019re wonderful, but i don\u2019t know how to be me and i don\u2019t know how to be me around you.\u201d the strength to say that", "i was in panic mode", "i was like, what, who, what do i do", "we didn\u2019t talk for some time", "i said, \u201chey, listen,\u201d i was already doing what i do", "i said, \u201chey, listen, let\u2019s go talk to somebody.\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cfine.\u201d she\u2019s latin and she\u2019s wonderful and she says to me with all the flair you can imagine, \u201cbut it\u2019s not gonna work.\u201d i said, \u201cokay.\u201d so we go to therapy", "it wasn\u2019t manufactured", "it was real and it was on", "i was about to lose something that was so dear and tender to me and that i had created the problem basically, right", "it was rad", "and yes, yes, yes, if you haven\u2019t done the work yet, get your ass in a chair and be real and sort it out with somebody", "it is unbelievable", "we dated", "we ended up doing that work for two years", "we dated", "we\u2019ve been married now for 20-something years", "it\u2019s rad", "it\u2019s rad", "i work with adults", "it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing", "there\u2019s no trickery", "so it has to work from sturdy and robust practices that will test and be weathered in rugged environments", "that\u2019s why i say there\u2019s no tricks, there\u2019s no hacks", "i don\u2019t know how you feel about hacks because it\u2019s talked about a lot", "but i have a reaction to it", "there is no shortcut", "yeah, i don\u2019t like the word", "i don\u2019t like the word", "i think it implies too many things to too many people in different ways", "it\u2019s nebulous", "it can be interpreted in a very expedient, band-aid type of fashion in the form of a shortcut", "i think looking for elegant, not obvious solutions is interesting", "sometimes those do end up being faster", "i don\u2019t like to think of them as hacks", "on this point though, with your experience at this conference, the fighters and so on, assuming that the clients (a) are going to do the work \u2013 they\u2019re there and they will do the work; (b) they have the budget", "are there any types of clients you no longer work with", "that you say no to", "yes", "what types", "people that have incredible influence and have low regard for others", "i was wondering why you stopped returning my phone calls", "just kidding", "how do you suss those people out", "it comes out in the first 15 minutes of a phone call", "that\u2019s like my screening process is there\u2019s a couple gates to get through for both of us", "one is the sniff test for both of us", "like, will you do the work", "does this guy know what he\u2019s talking about", "some questions", "i don\u2019t have a set of questions, but it\u2019s an organic feel", "then i\u2019d say i\u2019m probably shooting 85 percent from that first 15-minute conversation", "then when we show up in person, i know almost right away", "you can feel that", "what i\u2019ve learned in between now is to get, with permission from that person, are there a couple people that i could call to learn a little bit more about you before we make a final decision", "then i\u2019ll make a couple calls and do some due diligence", "it feels awful to take money from somebody who had incredible influence and is going to harm other people, not for a noble cause", "not for something that\u2019s right", "so if people are a-holes and they want to be more powerful, it doesn\u2019t feel good", "just on a process standpoint, one thing i\u2019m really interested in is if the person who wants to work with you is giving you three names, it\u2019s kind of like interviewing anyone for a job, they\u2019re going to give you references who are going to say nice things, generally", "so you\u2019re going into it knowing that these people are probably going to want to praise", "they don\u2019t know why i\u2019m asking though", "they don\u2019t know why i\u2019m asking", "they don\u2019t know if i\u2019m trying to suss out if they\u2019re a jerk or not or have low regard for other humans", "no understanding", "right", "now they do", "now they do", "don\u2019t worry", "no one\u2019s watching", "no one\u2019s watching; it\u2019s just us", "it brought to mind an approach that i thought was very clever", "i\u2019m going to ask about your questions, what you do on the phone", "a very clever approach that i heard from someone who is in charge of hiring at a fast-growing company", "they knew, at least in the state of california, you can get yourself in a lot of trouble as a reference if you start [inaudible] someone", "it can come back at you in a really nasty legal way", "how do you get someone to admit that the person they\u2019re supposed to be a reference for isn\u2019t a 10 out of 10", "so what this person would do is they would just call and they would deliberately call at a time they\u2019d get voicemail and they would say \u2013 \u201cif this person is a 10 out of 10 and you would recommend them with all their heart, call me back.\u201d if they didn\u2019t get a call back, they got their answer, without the other person incriminating themselves", "cool", "they had plausible deniability", "that\u2019s pretty clever, right", "that\u2019s good, yeah", "so when you call this person, friend of person x, what do you say", "what do you ask", "i just thank them for taking the call", "i have a little chitchat about how they know each other", "then i\u2019ll start to feel it out", "i don\u2019t have a system for this", "it\u2019s a conversation", "the things that i do like to think about with them are, have you ever been embarrassed around them", "so people will say yes or no or whatever", "but it\u2019s the hesitation that\u2019s important in that", "so i\u2019m just feeling the hesitation out", "i ask them about how they tip", "that tells a lot", "i ask them, are you going to work with them again in the future", "usually they\u2019re agents or managers or people that they send as a referral", "those are some of the things", "it\u2019s just a feel", "i don\u2019t know how to do it more systematically over the phone", "i\u2019m not in the hiring game, so i\u2019m not as good at that", "it\u2019s like a screening, i would say is the way i use it", "so tipping", "i worked in restaurants for a long time", "what are your rules for tipping", "what\u2019s your system", "i have one", "what\u2019s yours", "i just kind of do the same thing unless they\u2019re exceptional or awful", "so it\u2019s 20 percent and that\u2019s kind of what i\u2019ll do for everyone", "if they\u2019re exceptional, what does that mean", "it\u2019s like it just feels good to be at dinner", "like they\u2019ve somehow created to the environment and the experience of joy with people and food", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m looking for", "right down the middle, most people aren\u2019t exceptional at their jobs, which i think is a bold statement, but i think that\u2019s accurate", "so 20 percent, thank you, it\u2019s good", "it\u2019s fine", "then the other experience when people are awful, i don\u2019t want to leave anything", "it\u2019s really aggressive, but i usually tell people", "i\u2019m very similar", "i mean, having worked in hard restaurant environments and busted my ass to earn tips, i\u2019m just like, \u201cdude, you\u2019re just mailing it in", "you\u2019re not even trying.\u201d so, robert, the reason i wanted somebody to read is because i would bet \u2013 what i wanted to ask you, did your heart rate come up just asking a simple, little question", "yeah", "so how many of you \u2013 can i do this", "go for it", "how many of you here have a philosophy that you could say in 20 words or less", "hands up", "that\u2019s not enough", "that is not enough", "how many of you could come down and say it with tim and i right now", "we got some bold ones", "good, yeah", "we got some self-selection going on coming to the show", "and then, for robert, how many of you have those experiences where just saying your name at a table of strangers, your heart starts to pound", "that\u2019s interesting", "right", "so those are great moments because it\u2019s teaching you something about your psychological framework", "that what they think of you is now too important because your body is saying, \u201cis this a sabretooth?\u201d that\u2019s why that system\u2019s turned on", "or \u201cis this some other kind of threat that i don\u2019t know what to do with?\u201d those are great moments", "as often as we can find those moments to put ourselves in, that\u2019s how we build capacity to be able to one day express artistically", "capacity is a really important term", "i want to build on a few things that you said", "the first about the mindfulness, the present state awareness, my experience \u2013 i live in san francisco", "people are always on their phones", "l.a", "has a different thing", "this isn\u2019t everybody, but i had this experience", "i went to a party and this woman had just moved to l.a", "and she said, \u201cyeah, it\u2019s really difficult here because people will be talking to you and looking over each shoulder; looking for a bigger and better option.\u201d somebody who\u2019s walking around", "i was at this party and my phone had died and i was also a drinking a fair number of gin and sodas", "i was talking to people and they\u2019re like, \u201ci feel like you\u2019re really listening to me.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cyeah, because i\u2019m just looking into your eyes and listening to you.\u201d it doesn\u2019t take much", "it was like a super power", "it was unbelievable", "the bar right now is pretty low in general", "(a) it doesn\u2019t necessarily take a lot of work; (b) this piece on when did being on stage and worrying about people think become a threat", "i think it ties in very nicely to something you mentioned earlier, which is this systematic desensitization", "not to totally nerd out, but i will for a second", "stoicism, once again", "we have a gent named cato", "cato was considered by many, including seneca, to be the perfect stoic", "now, no one\u2019s perfect, but he lived the principles better than many or most", "one of the things cato would do is routinely purposefully do things that would get him ridiculed", "but on a surface level", "so he would wear different colored tunic, for instance, than was customary at the time, so that he would get ridiculed by people who were around him", "he trained himself to be regularly not embarrassed or to condition himself to not be embarrassed so that he could reserve being embarrassed for only those things that are worth being embarrassed about", "in doing so, he became very emboldened to share popular opinions because he built up that tolerance", "just like building up a base tan going into the sun", "you can\u2019t just jump out for two hours in the sun, looking as pale as i do especially, and expect that mind over matter you\u2019re suddenly going to tan really well", "you\u2019re going to get turned into a lobster", "psychologically, the same thing is true", "you can train yourself", "i have these pants, i\u2019m not wearing them right now, i call them party pants", "they\u2019re the most disgusting, ugly, floral pattern, grandma couch pants you\u2019ve ever seen", "i have a few things that i do like that, borrowed from somebody who lived more than 2,000 years ago, that are just as applicable today", "that\u2019s also something you can regularly train", "it\u2019s really important, i think, to honor that the same way you can train your body, you can train your mind", "systematically desensitizing yourself to what other people think of you at a surface level", "fantastic", "brilliant", "many of the concepts that we would talk about are not new", "grandma told them to you", "science will back them up in some kind of way, but they\u2019ve been practiced for thousands of years", "the science is nice because you don\u2019t have to rely on story-telling", "you can rely on some evidence or theoretical evidence at least", "the next question is from facebook", "this is from jimmy suta", "what\u2019s up, jimmy", "what\u2019s up, jimmy", "ask what techniques they use when visualizing \u2013 dark room and music", "do they meditate", "hypnosis", "what are best practices for visualization", "let\u2019s use the word, instead of visualization, use the word imagery", "visualization is just with one sense", "imagery conjures up the idea that we\u2019re going to light up our brain with as many senses as we can", "is the question where", "is that the question", "it seems to be across the board", "should i do it when it\u2019s light out", "in a dark room", "should i wear an eye mask", "listen to music or no music", "silence", "i think just the general guidelines", "the answer would be to play with it", "the science is not great for imagery, but the practice is pretty well understood", "music or no music, let\u2019s address that", "my experience has been better with no music", "some athletes like music", "i feel like it\u2019s a distraction to the objective", "the objective is to create such a lifelike experience that your body believes that it could be real and it might just be", "so there\u2019s a switching on or an animation that happens within you when you create an image that is crisp and has color and sound and smell and taste", "you can manipulate it in such a way that you\u2019re putting yourself in an electrically charging situation", "that\u2019s imagery in a nutshell", "can you be so skilled", "that takes time to activate those senses", "it\u2019s relatively easy to do color", "it\u2019s much harder to have color and control it and move it", "can you add the other variables of the other senses on top of it as you go", "again, this is a skill of focus as well", "so when your mind wanders, can you refocus", "again, there\u2019s a stitching to mindfulness in here, but the aim is different", "mindfulness is about insight and wisdom", "the aim of imagery is enhanced performance", "they\u2019re different in that vector", "what else would you want to know about it", "like we all know it works", "why don\u2019t we do it more often is the question", "i never really put this together before, but one thing that struck me is that perhaps one way to train that ability, given how you defined it using imagery, would be something that fascinated me \u2013 still fascinates me, in fact \u2013 fascinated me for a very long time", "that was training yourself to use mnemonic devices", "for instance, there\u2019s something called the memory palace", "it\u2019s also been called the loci technique", "cicero used it", "many people in the roman senate used it to memorize long speeches, where you\u2019re taking objects and placing them in a familiar location", "great book that talks about memory athlete competitions, specifically", "called moonwalking with einstein", "it features a friend of mine named ed cook, who trained somebody in a year to go from nothing to national memory champion", "it\u2019s incredible to look at how this works", "but it\u2019s embracing and learning to manipulate all the things you just mentioned, with a very clear objective and also a reward", "so you can do things like learn to memorize the serial numbers on five different bills someone gives you and then two weeks later you could give those serial numbers to them, indicating which bill it was on, like a $5, a $10 or a $20", "or do them backwards", "you can train yourself to do that in two or three days", "that could be interesting for people to pursue, potentially", "if you\u2019re nerdy and you like that kind of stuff", "i want to go back to fighting and imagery for just a moment and stitch those two concepts together", "rickson gracie", "oh, yeah", "rickson gracie is a legend in the fight world", "he and i did an interview probably 15 years ago, where i was asking him about imagery", "with a partner, i was creating the champion mind fighter dvd", "it was back when those dvds \u2013 this is before it was on spike tv, before it was a thing", "it was always a thing to fighters", "i asked him about imagery", "\u201cdo you do it?\u201d he says, \u201coh, yeah.\u201d he says, \u201ci do it.\u201d i said, \u201cwhat\u2019s it like?\u201d he just kind of gathers himself and he says, \u201cit\u2019s the most beautiful movie and every time i relive it, i create images and nuances that i want to experience", "so he called it \u2013 think about the care that you would have that you will spend time to enhance your imagination and use your imagination to create the most beautiful movie", "that tells you something about the way he\u2019s fundamentally orientated his life", "just doing a couple interviews here and there or, i don\u2019t know, four days before you\u2019re going to go give a speech", "that\u2019s not enough", "that\u2019s a hack", "that\u2019s taking good science, but not really living it", "when you think of the word \u201csuccessful,\u201d who or what is the first thing that comes to mind", "i think about success as a life of inner peace", "a life that has meaning and is adding to the wellness of the global community", "that\u2019s how i think about it", "i could pull out the word \u201cglobal\u201d and make that not necessarily the world, but one\u2019s own ecosystem, like the family unit", "so a sense of peace, exploring the giving and making something better than you left it", "there\u2019s a gentleman by the name of jon kabat-zinn", "\u201cwherever you go, there you are.\u201d is that it", "what\u2019s up, jon", "yeah, he\u2019s unbelievable", "i don\u2019t know him the way that it might sound i know him, but i feel like i feel him and i understand him and i love what he stands for", "i love how i feel around him", "he has done a tremendous gift to modern times to embrace the science of mindfulness", "i think he has an inner peace about him and he\u2019s worked at it", "i think he is a person who encapsulates it the best for me", "you mention an author that i\u2019m fond of", "are there any books that you\u2019ve given most as gifts", "if you give books as gifts", "yeah, i do", "i like to give poems", "on one page with great writing, there\u2019s so much in there", "what types of poets or poetry", "one of my favorites is oriah mountain dreamer", "oriah", "oriah mountain dreamer", "how do you spell oriah", "o-r-i-a-h, mountain dreamer", "got it", "just beautiful prose", "that\u2019s one", "\u201ci am me\u201d by virginia satir", "that\u2019s pretty powerful as well", "and then the book i think i spend a lot of time gifting is \u2013 it\u2019s a great applied book \u2013 jerry lynch wrote it with a co-author", "it\u2019s called the way of the champion", "the way of the champion", "yeah, very applied", "meets me right where, at the most simple concept", "it\u2019s a book that you do, rather than just read", "it\u2019s great", "i pass it out like it\u2019s candy in locker rooms", "do you have any favorite movies or documentaries", "i love documentaries", "i really do", "i think documentaries \u2013 i\u2019m much more interested in non-fiction than fiction; just the way that i think about things", "i can\u2019t remember a documentary that i said, \u201cthat\u2019s a bad documentary.\u201d because usually people that are shooting documentaries love it too", "it comes through the work", "it translates some kind of way", "i love documentaries", "favorite movie", "star wars", "i was captivated by it when i was eight", "it just kind of keeps coming back to me", "but as far as titles of documentaries", "you know what was good was amy", "amy", "that was very good", "it was really good", "the beauty and tragedy of an artistic genius", "so heart-wrenching", "that was captivating", "if i say $100 or less purchase that has significantly, positively impacted your life, does anything come to mind", "it doesn\u2019t have to be recent, but it could be recent", "yeah, two things pop up", "one is this $11.99 book that my wife bought my son and he won\u2019t put it down", "i have an eight-year-old son", "what\u2019s up, grayson", "any little book that i give my son feels like the greatest gift in the world because he becomes mesmerized by the imagination and the stories inside of it", "that\u2019s been really good", "do you remember the title", "it\u2019s something about pok\u00e9mon", "i think it\u2019s the something-pok\u00e9mon whatever", "he\u2019s all about it", "so that\u2019s been really good", "then i\u2019d say not for my would be soft tissue work", "soft tissue work", "massage and soft tissue work", "i think it\u2019s an incredible gift for all of us, for alignment", "if you feel tension in your muscular system", "if you had to give a ted talk or just a very high-profile 20-minute speech on nothing that you\u2019re known for, nothing you\u2019ve spoken on before", "it could be a weekend obsession, it could be star wars", "but what would you choose", "what kind of question is that", "it\u2019s a curveball question", "yeah", "what are \u2013 where are we trying to go with that", "yeah, what are we trying to sort out", "we\u2019re not trying to sort out anything in particular", "i\u2019m not solving climate change here", "i\u2019ll tell you where this comes from", "where it comes from is i was having a conversation with a gentleman named marc andreessen", "marc andreessen created the first popular graphical web browser or co-authored it", "mosaic", "he is a serial billionaire", "one of the most successful investors on the planet", "an incredible writer", "the guy\u2019s a real polymath", "one of the many ways that he finds opportunities is he asks what are the nerds doing on the weekends or in the evenings", "what are they spending their time on", "did you just call me a nerd", "no", "although that would be a compliment", "you did just mention star wars", "i mean, let\u2019s be fair", "and pok\u00e9mon", "and pok\u00e9mon", "so what i\u2019m trying to suss out is any side obsessions that you have", "i don\u2019t think i have a great answer for that", "like what do i think \u2013 surfing would be the thing that i try to fit in the best way i possibly can, which is tough to do", "would i give a talk on surfing", "probably not", "i don\u2019t know", "i spend so much time thinking about the human experience, it would have to be something outside of the human experience", "so i don\u2019t know where to go", "well here, i\u2019ll give you one", "what is the hardest challenge that you are currently working on yourself", "hardest challenge", "i think it\u2019s always authenticity", "i think that\u2019s always it", "then moving as deep as i can to places that are uncomfortable", "what would that be", "it\u2019s saying the thing that i find difficult to say because it requires this fear that i have that if i say this thing that i feel like is true and pure, and it hurts another person, then that tension becomes really challenging in the relationship", "i\u2019m significantly better because i practice a lot, but that thing is, i think, really hard for people", "for me, i should say", "that would be one of them", "and then business", "i\u2019m building a business right now with coach carroll and figuring out entrepreneurship in that frame", "is this win forever", "yeah", "this is a consulting model where we have taken his intellectual property and mine \u2013 his on culture building and mine on mindset training \u2013 and put them together where we think we\u2019ve captured and we\u2019re on to something about how to share that with people that are not in sport", "it\u2019s landing in the business world on how to shape cultures that are meaningful and then train the people, really the capital inside of our workforces, to be their very best", "that sounds wonderful", "how do you actually create a business that has scale and meaning", "i love it", "it\u2019s hard, but i love it", "that is a challenge", "what is the worst advice that you hear often in your field", "i\u2019ll let you define field however you want", "the field would be squarely within psychology, in the facets of human performance, that\u2019s the field", "particularly from the invisible standpoint", "but the worst advice is advice", "that\u2019s it", "advice is awful", "it\u2019s just like saying stuff that \u2013 you should, why don\u2019t you, how come, that\u2019s what you should do", "that\u2019s the stuff", "but i\u2019d say more specifically than the general answer would be that you too can be everything you want to be", "not necessarily", "maybe in some kind of make-believe world that everybody is going to be amazing", "i don\u2019t see people putting in the work to do it", "motivation", "i don\u2019t know anything about it", "i don\u2019t know anything about motivation because the people i work with don\u2019t need it", "they\u2019re driven", "they\u2019re fully committed to a particular way of living", "so this idea that we need motivation", "we don\u2019t need motivation", "we need to find ourselves and what is true and honest", "when it matters to us", "i know this to be true for me, i\u2019ll do whatever it takes", "i think that\u2019s what we want to help people find", "that stuff", "sorry for a little soapbox moment there", "soapbox on", "do you have \u2013 and i\u2019ll explain what this means \u2013 do you have any favorite failures", "what i mean by that is a failure or failures that in hindsight actually set you up for future successes", "i know we\u2019ve talked about how we can semantically drill down on that, but i think you get what i mean", "yeah", "i think i\u2019ve shared them with you already, which is the love of my life saying that this isn\u2019t working anymore", "both of us co-created that relationship", "but that was unbelievably painful to go through that journey", "so many of us have done it", "that was what was an incredible gift of strength that she demonstrated for me and for us", "i think that was a big one", "i was an absolute selfish, craft-obsessed human being that was not watering and loving properly the people that mattered the most", "that thing is real", "that\u2019s an incredible gift", "fundamentally altered in my life", "excluding that \u2013 this is leading to the next question \u2013 what is one of the most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made", "i\u2019ll explain what i mean by that", "it could be money, time, energy, anything else", "i\u2019ll give you an example", "there\u2019s a woman named amelia boone", "she\u2019s the most decorated obstacle course racer of all time", "three-time world\u2019s toughest mudder champion", "just an incredible athlete", "her answer was, the $450.00 for her first entrance fee into one of these competitions", "it was a real stretch for her at the time, but having taken that step, it opened up an entire world of possibility for her", "what would your answer or one of your answers be", "what was the first question", "one of the most worthwhile investments of time, energy, [inaudible]", "time is all we get", "that is what we\u2019re competing for and with right now", "it\u2019s the greatest thing we\u2019re trying to suss out, i think, is how can we be here now", "so the easy one is time", "investment in understanding how to be here now and be on time, i feel like is the gift that i\u2019m trying to help others find as well", "but more concretely, there was a moment when i had just graduated my ph.d", "program and there was one of two ways that i could go", "the two ways \u2013 one was i could get licensed and the other was i could not get licensed", "so licensed as a psychologist means that you\u2019ve gotten certain privileges and restrictions, but you are part of the club that can do psychological services and medical services", "i had a moment when i was back to when i was really young", "if i don\u2019t take the test \u2013 i had all these reasons \u2013 if i don\u2019t go get licensed, i\u2019ll be able to build a business and i\u2019ll be fine", "because you don\u2019t have to be licensed to do some of the work that we\u2019re talking about", "but so it was like this personal decision", "do i go and get tested or do i not", "it was one of these really cool moments where i was like, you know what", "i\u2019m letting it rip", "i can remember getting the results back", "i was in the first home that i bought with my wife and getting that thing back and the results back after six weeks of waiting, i was jumping up and down", "that was a moment of test that was meaningful for me and it created a lot of freedom for other tests", "after all of your experiences with the sats and so on and hating tests, what was the self-talk to make that decision", "to go for that test", "yeah", "i would be a phony", "i really did want it", "this goes back to surfing", "i really did want it, but i couldn\u2019t do it", "i was afraid to do it", "i was afraid to put myself out there to not be good enough", "that was the model that others were going to determine if i was good enough", "so i was right on the cusp of it during this test-taking thing", "i could go and build a business the other way, or i could go and get tested", "it was really just for me", "so being honest with yourself", "yeah, i was being honest", "ladies and gentlemen, dr", "michael gervais", "all right", "thank you, guys"]}
