Suzy Amis Cameron: Well, Tim, first of all, we want to say hi. And when we first met\u00a0you, we were all flying around in the parabolic flight with \u2013 James Cameron: Oh, Elon Musk and a bunch of other crazy folks doing somersaults in\u00a0zero G. Suzy Amis Cameron: Super fun. Super fun. James Cameron: So hey, Tim. Thanks for having us on the show. We\u2019re honored to be here \u2013 Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. Really, really excited. James Cameron: \u2013 on the podcast. Do you still call a podcast a show? I guess. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. The Tim Ferriss Show. James Cameron: Oh. Well, then I guess if it\u2019s called the Tim Ferriss show, then it\u2019s gotta be a show. Suzy Amis Cameron: Exactly. So here we are. All right. So our first question that we\u2019re going to answer: Besides your own, what is the book or books you\u2019ve given most as a gift and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life? James Cameron: Well, we give a lot of books as presents because we\u2019re always evangelizing and proselytizing for plant-based nutrition, for the environment and sustainability and things like that. Suzy, every year, makes up a gift bag on a theme. But usually, the theme is around sustainability. And there are always some books in there. So we give out a lot of books. Suzy Amis Cameron: Thousands and thousands and thousands of books. James Cameron: Right. So the publisher of The China Study, for example, probably noticed a big uptick in sales about the year that we decided to send all our friends The China Study and Forks Over Knives. I think this happens a lot with plant-based eaters, that they become like born again Christians. They want to share the good news with everybody. So they become insufferable for the first year or so. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yes. We were, definitely. And people would see us coming, and they would turn around and run the other way. James Cameron: Yeah, waddle the other way. If they follow our advice, they could run. Suzy Amis Cameron: Exactly. But I think we\u2019ve gotten a little more tactful in our approach. I think the other book that I\u2019ve been giving out a lot is The Cheese Trap by Dr. Neal Barnard. James Cameron: Sure, because you hear so much. So many people say, \u201cWell, I think I could do it. I could give up meat. Yeah, no problem. But I don\u2019t see how I can give up cheese.\u201d Suzy Amis Cameron: Oh, it\u2019s the hardest thing to give up. James Cameron: And that book is so great at showing why it is a trap, why it\u2019s basically an addiction. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right? So all mammals have naturally occurring opiates in their breastmilk for a reason because it keeps the baby coming back to nurse so that it will thrive. But if you think about a human baby growing from seven pounds to 18 pounds in a year and then you think of a cow growing from 60 pounds to 600 pounds in a year, you\u2019re getting that many more opiates. And you think about \u2013 so you\u2019re just having a glass of milk or cream in your coffee. But you have yogurt, and it\u2019s condensed that down even more. James Cameron: And cheese is condensed even further. So it\u2019s sort of bioconcentrating the naturally occurring opiates. Suzy Amis Cameron: Exactly. And it\u2019s like a block of morphine. So yeah. Dairy\u2019s really difficult to give up. But there are so many alternatives now, way more than there were six and a half years ago when we went plant-based. James Cameron: Yeah. Some of the alternative cheeses, they\u2019re nut-based cheeses, cashew-based, and so on \u2013 Suzy Amis Cameron: Miyoko\u2019s. James Cameron: \u2013 are getting pretty good. You can cook with them. And they have the same texture and mouth feel, cookability, and things like that. And that\u2019s all just in the last couple of years. I can\u2019t think of a cheese dish that you can\u2019t duplicate pretty well entirely from plant sources now. Of course, you\u2019re not getting your opiates. But then you don\u2019t want to be a heroin addict either. Suzy Amis Cameron: No, but you\u2019ve got a natural high from eating plants already. So you don\u2019t need it. James Cameron: Yeah, right. Exactly. It makes up for it. Oh, good, baby. That was nice. Yeah. But in terms of books, I think this is \u2013 I think we\u2019re supposed to answer more broadly than just about our utter fixation with plant-based nutrition. Another book that I\u2019ve shared a lot is Sapiens which is an incredible book that\u2019s got nothing to do with plant-based nutrition. It\u2019s just an amazing book. It explains human behavior and why we are the way we are in human civilization from soup to nuts. And I\u2019ve read it now a couple of times. It\u2019s a pretty astonishing book. I\u2019m recommending that. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. I think there\u2019s another book that I recommended so often which was Arianna Huffington\u2019s book, Thrive. Her journey of burning herself out and realizing how important sleep and self-care were \u2013 and it gives you license to take care of yourself in a world that people think that overachievers are triple-type A, that you need to be that way to succeed. So that\u2019s actually a really good book too. James Cameron: Well, you do to an extent. But you\u2019ve gotta be able to go the distance. So you gotta pace yourself. And long-term success is definitely about pacing yourself. And if I\u2019m going to loop it back to our favorite topic, no. The kind of energy and stamina and recovery that you get from being a whole food, plant-based eater, it\u2019s what\u2019s gotten me through a year of production. I\u2019ve never done a year of production in my life. Titanic took six months to shoot. And we just finished a year because we did Avatar 2 and Avatar 3 back to back. And that was one solid year of production. And I\u2019m feeling great, whereas before, I\u2019d be completely burned out after a six-month shoot and require a month to recover. Suzy Amis Cameron: Well, you got sick a lot on the first one. Flus and colds, and \u2013 James Cameron: Yeah. I got sick on Avatar. I got sick on Titanic. And since we went plant-based six and a half years ago, I literally haven\u2019t been sick at all. Like, zero. Not even a sniffle or a cough or a sore throat. Nothing. So yeah. It works. Suzy Amis Cameron: And certainly, being on the road and selling my new book, I know that it\u2019s giving me an edge to be able to pop back and forth between different time zones and things like that, on top of being a mom of five and running a school. James Cameron: To truthfully answer the question, you can\u2019t plug your own book though because he said, \u201cWhat book besides your own\u2026?\u201d Suzy Amis Cameron: Oh, right. Sorry. James Cameron: All right. So what\u2019s the next question? Suzy Amis Cameron: Okay. We\u2019re going to the next question now. How has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success? Do you have a favorite failure of yours? James Cameron: Oh, well, I don\u2019t think I can answer that question because I\u2019ve never failed at anything. No. Well, I\u2019ve been lucky on my directed films. I\u2019ve only had one that underperformed, and that was The Abyss. That wasn\u2019t a hit. I\u2019ve had produced films that didn\u2019t do well and certainly learned from those. But my film that I would consider a failure because it wasn\u2019t a hit \u2013 it was a break-even project. It was quite big in its day. It was considered I think probably one of the most expensive films ever made in its time, although it\u2019s nothing by present standards \u2013 was The Abyss which was released in 1989.  And I think I learned some strong lessons from that about the craft of shaping a story in post-production, and maximizing, and even in the writing. I learned from that film that the emotional peak came well before the ending. And then the ending was this ambitious visual overreach. And I think I couldn\u2019t have made Titanic, and Titanic wouldn\u2019t have been a hit if I hadn\u2019t done The Abyss because on Titanic, I kept The Abyss in mind. And I shaped it to have the maximum emotional orchestration to the end of the film and to keep the visual effects in check so that they always served \u2013 the storyline served the narrative and served the characters. So it took The Abyss failing for Titanic to be the success that it was I think. I don\u2019t mean commercial success but artistic success, let\u2019s say. So yeah. It\u2019s all a journey. Filmmaking\u2019s a journey. Every film itself is a journey. But then across the films, the metanarrative that runs across the films is also a journey. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right. Well, I think you always hear failing forward. And certainly, when the school that I founded with my sister, Rebecca Amis \u2013 we founded a school called MUSE school. And we decided in January of \u201914 that we were going to take the school plant-based because it\u2019s an environmental school. And we couldn\u2019t call ourselves an environmental school and still be serving animal products. James Cameron: Yeah. It\u2019d be like driving a Humvee to work, calling yourself an environmentalist. It just seemed like such a cognitive dissonance to us that we had to stand for something. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. Definitely. So we decided to take the school plant-based and promptly created a mutiny. We lost 50% of our families. And I just thought \u2013 I thought the school was going to close. James Cameron: Yeah. You were surprised. Suzy Amis Cameron: I didn\u2019t think it was going to succeed. And it was really nerve-wracking. But it just felt like the right thing to do. And ultimately, in the end, we regained our enrollment very quickly. And we\u2019ve now surpassed it. And families move from all over the United States. We even have a couple of families that have moved from out of country to move to Calabasas to come to the school because it\u2019s environmental, because it\u2019s passion- and interest-based learning, because it\u2019s plant-based. So it\u2019s really about trusting your instinct and your gut and doing the right thing, doing something that you think is going to make a difference in life. James Cameron: But we talked about it before we did it. And I think the final conclusion was, \u201cScrew it. If it tanks the school, it tanks the school. But you gotta stand on your principles.\u201d Suzy Amis Cameron: Because if you don\u2019t stand for something, you fall for everything. James Cameron: Yeah, exactly. And the thing is that you approached the problem very systematically. And you set a timetable to do it that was more than a year out. And you brought in speakers. You had a speaker series. And you had town halls and brought the parents in and included them or tried to. When you talk to people about their food, it\u2019s like talking to them about religion or partisan politics. People get very entrenched in their belief systems. And their identity becomes defined by their beliefs. And they\u2019d rather die than be wrong. They\u2019d rather be unhealthy than be wrong. Or they\u2019d rather have their kids be unhealthy than be wrong. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. It\u2019s true. We took 18 months to educate everyone. And we really went at it from every different angle. So we brought in doctors. We brought in climate scientists. We brought in chefs. We brought in athletes. We brought in authors. We brought in animal rights people. And they would spend the day with the children. And then at the end of the day, we would bring the adults in, give them a glass of wine and some beautiful plant-based, delicious food. And even after all of that, we still had pushback. James Cameron: Yeah. Well, it was seen as a top-down push. And even though you were trying to get buy-in \u2013 and I think a lot of that experience probably \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about failing forward, not only did the school prosper as a result, but if I can swing this back around to your book, I don\u2019t think you would have written OMD the way you did, as inclusively as you did if you hadn\u2019t gone through that experience because you realized how people are entrenched in a belief system that\u2019s enculturated. We all grew up with it. Our parents taught us. Their grandparents taught them. Meat for strength. Milk for bones and teeth and all that sort of thing. Suzy Amis Cameron: Well, that\u2019s a good point because what ended up happening after all of the work that we had done to try to educate people and really give them a way into it, our head of school, Jeff King, got very frustrated one day with the parents. And he said, \u201cPeople, you can give them eggs and bacon in the morning. And you can give them a burger at night. It\u2019s one meal a day. It\u2019s OMD.\u201d And so MUSE \u2013 James Cameron: That\u2019s where OMD came from. Suzy Amis Cameron: That\u2019s where OMD came from. It was born there. And that\u2019s when I took that idea and wrote a book around the idea of it. James Cameron: Yeah. Are you down with OMD? Yeah. But it\u2019s great because it\u2019s inclusive, because it understands that people \u2013 I think they fall into two categories. You\u2019ve got very close-minded people that won\u2019t even listen, and then you\u2019ve got people that have actually read enough and heard enough to realize that it would be beneficial to them but don\u2019t think they can do it, but are curious about it and maybe want to try it. And the great thing about OMD is it\u2019s one meal a day. And if you make that pledge, not only are you cutting your carbon footprint and your environmental footprint significantly, but you\u2019re starting to feel some delta. There\u2019s going to be some change in the way that you feel, and in your health, and so on. And you get to see how relatively easy it is. And it\u2019s not that big a deal. The fear of it is greater than the actual process of doing it. Suzy Amis Cameron: Well, I think that that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a \u2013 it\u2019s a non-judgmental \u2013 it\u2019s not about perfection. It\u2019s just one meal and realizing how empowering it is for one person to be able to make a difference in your carbon footprint and your water footprint. So one person eating one plant-based meal for one year saves 200,000 gallons of water and the carbon equivalent of driving from Los Angeles to New York. And people don\u2019t realize that animal agriculture is the second leading cause of greenhouse gases, more than all transportation combined. So you can make more of a difference for the environment by what you\u2019re putting on your plate than the kind of car you\u2019re driving. James Cameron: Yeah. Look, electrification of transportation system is critical in the long-run just like changing to renewable energy is critical. But these are things that take time. And something you can do immediately, instantaneously \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be able to afford to buy a hybrid or a plug-in hybrid \u2013 is change what you eat. It\u2019s very simple. It brings the power back to the individual. Now you know you\u2019re living right with nature, that you\u2019re not one of the millions of people that\u2019s responsible for cutting down an acre of rainforest a second in Brazil which is what\u2019s happening right now to make room for crop land. Everybody thinks, \u201cWhy is the environmental footprint so high for cattle?\u201d It\u2019s not what the cattle are eating. It\u2019s not the water that the cattle are drinking so much.  It\u2019s the fact that so much deforestation and misuse of land is taking place to grow crops to feed the cattle, whereas the efficiency factor for humans eating the grains and the plants directly is, depending on where the cattle are growing and who the people are and all that sort of thing, it ranges from 20 to 40 times more efficient in terms of land-use. If everybody on earth eats the way we do collectively here in the US, were to do that and our population continues to grow to nine billion, as is projected by 2050, we need four planet earths. We\u2019re already way into overshoo \u2013 we\u2019re already way past sustainability already with the number of people we have and with the number of people that are still not eating the way we do. So there\u2019s a sort of a social justice aspect to it as well, if you think about it. Those people that don\u2019t eat like us can\u2019t eat like us. It will not be allowed by the laws of nature.  There\u2019s a social justice issue to this in addition to the environmental issue and the animal rights issue and all that. So that\u2019s on the negative side. But on the positive side, the thing that\u2019s great about this is not only is your health going to improve. But if you\u2019re an athlete or even just a casual athlete, play tennis, whatever, your performance is going to improve greatly. Got another question there? We rambled all over the place. Suzy Amis Cameron: Next question: What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise? James Cameron: Well, the one recommendation that I hear all the time that\u2019s given to kids and everything is, \u201cDo what you love.\u201d And I would modify that strongly. Do what you love that is also something people will pay you for. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right, which is what you have found out how to do very successfully. James Cameron: Yeah. Right. I get to do what I love. And I love making films. I love all the things that I spend time on, exploration and all that. People don\u2019t pay you to be an explorer. I can say that. You go do something that you love and make money. Then you go get to do something that you love that people won\u2019t pay you for, like deep ocean exploration because there is no money in that game whatsoever. But what other recommendation? Well, look. The question was your profession or field of expertise. So we know a lot about plant-based nutrition. So I\u2019m going to vector it back to that. There are so many \u2013 Suzy Amis Cameron: Well, I have a certification through eCornell. James Cameron: Yeah. That\u2019s right. You\u2019re a certified nutritionist. So many bad recommendations in nutrition. And doctors make them all the time. Doctors tell you to build yourself up by eating meat. Suzy Amis Cameron: It\u2019s not their fault, either. It\u2019s just the way they\u2019ve been trained. James Cameron: Or not trained because they don\u2019t study nutrition. I was talking to a doctor the other day who\u2019s on a cardiology path. He\u2019s still in university. Said, \u201cHow much nutritional training have you had?\u201d because I had said in a public speaking thing they only get about somewhere between an hour and a day total of nutritional training through seven years of med school. And he said, \u201cAbout an hour.\u201d And so doctors are myth-propagators these days, the myth that you need meat for protein. In fact, interestingly enough, the vast majority of doctors conflate the term protein and meat, like it is one thing. Certainly, meat is a source of protein. That\u2019s about all that\u2019s in it besides protein and fat as opposed to plants being a source of protein and a source of minerals and phytonutrients and micronutrients of all kinds and trace elements and all sorts of stuff. Suzy Amis Cameron: But people don\u2019t think that protein is in vegetables. There\u2019s protein in Iceberg lettuce. James Cameron: Where did the cow get it? It\u2019s pretty simple. So the truth with animal proteins is that they\u2019re not \u2013 it\u2019s not just that they\u2019re inefficient for the environment and that they come packaged with an awful lot of fat, but that the actual biomolecular structure of the protein is not healthy for humans. And I know there are probably a lot of paleo eaters in the audience for this podcast. And, we all tend to live in a confirmation-bias kind of environment where we seek out the information that confirms what we want to know. But I would encourage them to look into what plant-based nutritionists are saying about meat proteins and what real paleoanthropologists are saying about what ancient humans ate. But we\u2019re not adapted for a diet of meat. We can eat meat. Meat was a killer app back in the ice age when the plants were covered by snow all the time. You could die out if you were a vegetarian.  And when we, collectively, the human species migrated up into northern Europe which was where they didn\u2019t have any competition \u2013 there was plenty of competition in Africa. As you started to move up into northern Europe, you got into virgin territory. And that\u2019s why we migrated up there and lost our melanin, got pale-skinned and learned to adapt to the cold and all that stuff. You weren\u2019t going to make it through the winter if you were 100% plant-based which is why you don\u2019t have a lot of gorillas in Scotland. So yeah. It was a killer app. It allowed the expansion of the human species. But we weren\u2019t initially evolutionarily selected to do it. That\u2019s a more recent thing. Suzy Amis Cameron: Well, I think the other myth too is that men really feel like they need that meat protein in order to be manly. And you just had great success showing Game Changers to your whole crew down on the set of Avatar because it\u2019s full of elite male athletes. It\u2019s got female athletes in there as well. James Cameron: I gotta just interject. The Game Changers is a film that Suzy and I just executive produced that was directed by Louis Psihoyos. It\u2019s not out yet. But we think it\u2019s going to make a profound difference in this male myth of meat proteins. But anyway, carry on. Sorry. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah, because men believe that they need the meat to be manly. And it\u2019s quite the antithesis. And you saw an unbelievable reaction with your crew. The set of Avatar is actually the first plant-based catered set ever. And so they\u2019re doing one meal a day and saving an enormous amount of water and carbon. James Cameron: Yeah. We give them great food. It\u2019s about 200 people between our technical team and our production group and so on. Suzy Amis Cameron: But now, it\u2019s like there\u2019s a line out the door since you showed the movie. James Cameron: Well, yeah. It was hysterical because a year ago, we went plant-based on the production because we wanted to be the greenest production ever. And we have our own solar power. We have a one megawatt solar power facility on the roof. And the idea was that \u2013 I sat the whole team down and said, \u201cGuys, if we\u2019re going to make these films that stand for something about the environment and our relationship with nature, we have to walk the walk. So we\u2019re going to do a green set. And the way to do a green set is the same way Suzy did the green school. So we\u2019re going to go one meal a day. We\u2019re going to eat plant-based for our lunch. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to cater.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t a dictatorship. People could always go across the street to any of the many restaurants in the area, fast food joints in the area. It\u2019s in an urban area. We\u2019re not out in the woods.  \u201cBut if you want to eat the free food, then it\u2019s going to be plant-based. And hopefully, you\u2019ll see that it can be not only nourishing but fun and yummy. And we\u2019ll have Thai noodles. And we\u2019ll have lasagna. And we\u2019ll have pizza. And we\u2019ll have all the stuff you love. It just will be from plant-based sources.\u201d So they\u2019ve done that for a year. But it dropped down to where maybe we\u2019d only have half attendance at lunch. The day we screened Game Changers \u2013 and everybody was asked to show up. We did it on company time. That lunch, they ran out of food because everybody showed up. We had so many converts after seeing that film. And at least 20 people have come to me in the weeks since and said, \u201cI\u2019ve made the decision. I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m going plant-based.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m going to do a 21-day challenge.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m a week in. And I feel great.\u201d All that stuff.  Of course, it\u2019s all anecdotal. But if we\u2019d thought about it, we could have done a before and after study, a proper scientific study because we\u2019ve got a big enough cohort. We\u2019ve got a couple hundred people. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. Exactly. Well, I know that the chefs are happy with everybody lining up to eat the yummy food. And it is. It\u2019s delicious. Next question? James Cameron: Next question. Suzy Amis Cameron: Okay. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life? James Cameron: Can we stretch the envelope to six and half years? Because that\u2019s how long we\u2019ve been plant-based. Suzy Amis Cameron: I know. Well, I was planning on doing that anyway because it\u2019s been \u2013 it absolutely changed our lives, not only from a health point of view but understanding the whole mental impact. But it\u2019s also affected what our investments are. And everything that we do, every decision that we make, every request that we have goes through that lens of plant-based eating. James Cameron: Sure. We built a factory up in Canada. There\u2019s a company called Verdient that makes plant-based proteins from yellow peas and lentils. And it\u2019s one of the largest dry protein processing plants in Canada. So that was an investment decision that was guided by our epiphany. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right. And now, we\u2019re using those plant proteins to actually work with the food center \u2013 James Cameron: In Saskatchewan. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right. In Saskatchewan at the University of Saskatchewan and create food products. So I\u2019m going to be rolling out OMD food products in early \u201919. They\u2019re making things like ginger beef and pulled pork and cheeses and pasta sauces and snacks. James Cameron: Yeah. So there will be a whole OMD line, a whole bunch of different skews on that. So yeah. So it had a profound impact on us. And that was one single change, habit change, behavior change. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right. I know that I have certainly found my purpose in life. And it\u2019s what propelled me to write a book which has completely changed the trajectory of what I was doing. I was going into education and schools. But interestingly enough, it has fed into that because now, MUSE school is being launched worldwide, MUSE Global. And all of those schools will be OMD schools. They\u2019ll all have the same philosophy that we carry at MUSE Prime. James Cameron: Well, it\u2019s resonated beautifully because the MUSE school cafeteria was voted the greenest restaurant in the world. So apparently, there\u2019s a competition for the world\u2019s greenest restaurant. And all the big snooty, urban, seat to table restaurants all hope to win. And this little, humble, elementary school cafeteria beat them all by like, 400 points because the school is solar powered. And all the produce is grown \u2013 or most of the produce is grown on site. And the building was built out of repurposed building materials. It\u2019s like you literally ticked every box just by walking the walk and because it\u2019s plant-based. So it\u2019s got a \u2013 a 100% plant-based eater has one-third of the carbon footprint of a standard American diet eater, meaning a meat-eater. So yeah. So you kicked their butts. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. We did. We had had three out of four stars for a long time. But when we went plant-based, it just really jettisoned us out. And we beat the restaurant in Chicago. James Cameron: We\u2019re not going to name names. But they\u2019re all high end. Suzy Amis Cameron: No. Exactly. All right. So next question? James Cameron: Sure. Suzy Amis Cameron: Okay. When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? If helpful, what questions do you ask yourself? James Cameron: So what do I do when I feel overwhelmed? I clean off my desk because when I\u2019m working at a high pace, everything piles up. And just the act of cleaning off my desk, it\u2019s like a reset. It\u2019s like power cycling a computer. It\u2019s a reboot. And I usually find that about half the stuff that\u2019s accumulated, I can throw out. And the other half, I have to put in piles. I have to put them in the right place. So now I\u2019m prioritizing. Now I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s still important.\u201d So I think that if you\u2019re a team leader, you\u2019ve gotta get your own priorities straight before you can generate priorities for the team. And I\u2019ve found that whenever I hit one of those moments, I also find it\u2019s great to take a day off or even half a day off. Just force yourself to take a day off not to go play but to just reorganize and just write down the series of priorities or memos to yourself.  And out of that, I typically will generate things that I hand out to my team to give them their marching orders to get us back on track. And it\u2019s amazing how things just pop into focus and solutions present themselves because I haven\u2019t stopped running, I haven\u2019t gotten off the treadmill until that moment to lift my head out of the day-to-day battle, to think about, \u201cWell, how are we going to really win this war?\u201d because something like a big film production is like a campaign that takes place over sometimes a period of years. And if you don\u2019t take a moment out to look at the big picture \u2013 so most of the major strategic decisions that I\u2019ve made during the productions of the two Avatar films so far over the last couple of years have come from that down day, that catch-up day.  It\u2019s not about taking a day off or taking a nap. That\u2019s a good idea too. And go swim or play with the kids or whatever. You gotta do that too. But just take a day for yourself with no distractions to just get everything in order. That helps me a lot. If nothing else, I just feel better about it. I come in. There\u2019s a clean desk. \u201cHere\u2019s some memos. You guys go do the work.\u201d Suzy Amis Cameron: Well, I think we\u2019re really similar on that. I have a tendency to walk through the house and get ridiculously overwhelmed with all the kids and the cats and the dogs and the bearded dragon and the people. And so I always like to go in and just reorganize the house. But I always start with my office as well. And I like to take a big piece of typing paper and write out \u2013 I create columns. And I write out all my emails that I need to do and all my calls that I need to do. And then there\u2019s a whole section in there just for household thing \u2013 James Cameron: Lists are good. Suzy Amis Cameron: \u2013 and work things and all of those. And I know that the children are learning this as well because when they \u2013 of course, they roll their eyes when I walk in and say, \u201cOkay. We\u2019re going to take a clean day, an organizing day. And here are some boxes for giveaways.\u201d They roll their eyes. But in the end, they love it. And they feel better. James Cameron: Yeah. They get into it. Suzy Amis Cameron: And they get into it. So it\u2019s the same sort of thing. And taking a walk and then realizing, \u201cOkay. What is the first thing I can do that\u2019s going to get me on that journey towards my goal?\u201d but always keeping that goal in mind of whatever that is. James Cameron: Sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to walk away from it for a second. It\u2019s counterintuitive for us type A types that just bash our heads against the problem all day long, \u201cBoom, boom, boom, boom,\u201d \u2013 Suzy Amis Cameron: Right. We\u2019re triple-A. James Cameron: \u2013 day after day. I had an epiphany while I was writing Avatar. I was working down in New Zealand. Office was in the country. And I was just having a \u2013 it was just impossible to solve some of the dramatic problems. I couldn\u2019t solve it. I couldn\u2019t fix the script. And I was sitting. And I just walked away. I sat down. Sat outside. And there was a glass cover to the veranda. And I watched this big fly. And he was trying to get out. And he was banging against the glass. And he just kept hitting the glass over and over and over and over because that\u2019s how his little chip was programmed. You go toward the light. You go toward the sky. And he couldn\u2019t get to the sky. All he had to do was drop down, fly three feet sideways, and come out. But he couldn\u2019t process it.  And I thought, \u201cHow often am I that fly? How often is there some higher level of perspective that I lack in my chip that I\u2019m missing that is so simple that some fourth dimensional being could look at the problem and go, \u2018Oh, you idiot. You just drop down, go over three feet, and you\u2019re out.\u2019\u201d But the fly couldn\u2019t do it. And I thought, \u201cWell, what am I not seeing?\u201d And that\u2019s when I went back to first principles. And I looked at the whole thing from a higher level. I got out of the trenches for that moment. And that\u2019s how I solved the problem. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. I think also, too, is learning when to recognize when you\u2019re hitting that window and also learning to recognize when it\u2019s the path of least resistance because you know you\u2019re on the right path when doors just continue to open up. James Cameron: Well, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s the opposite. That\u2019s the other thing. It\u2019s important to recognize when things are breaking your way. When you have momentum, when you\u2019re not hitting the glass, you take advantage of it. And you ride that tailwind. Suzy Amis Cameron: But there\u2019s a difference too. It\u2019s when you know you want to do something and you feel really strongly about it and you have a lot of people around you saying, \u201cNo,\u201d and, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be too hard.\u201d I know it works for you that way. But that just lights an inferno under my butt. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Really? No? Watch me.\u201d James Cameron: Yeah. I\u2019d love to say that to my team on Avatar. \u201cOh, well, we shouldn\u2019t do that, guys because that\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d when they know coming in when they sign up that it\u2019s going to be the most difficult production in human history just by its nature where every blade of grass in the entire world that we\u2019re creating is created by somebody, by a computer artist or by some kind of algorithm that\u2019s self-growing or whatever.  You know by definition it\u2019s going to be hard. You\u2019re there because it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s hard because that\u2019s how you measure yourself against that challenge. And that\u2019s why everybody that\u2019s on the Avatar team is there because they know it\u2019s going to be the hardest motherfucker they ever work on. And they want that. Now, they\u2019ll all go whine about it later and say, \u201cThat was the hardest motherfucker I ever worked on.\u201d And that\u2019s why I have this reputation as a cruel taskmaster. But in fact, they\u2019ve all showed up because they want to do that. They want to climb that mountain. Suzy Amis Cameron: And they\u2019ve learned from it, like the teachers at MUSE. They\u2019re teaching in a way they\u2019ve never \u2013 nobody teaches that way. And it\u2019s really challenging. But they learn. James Cameron: Yeah. The kids don\u2019t like holidays because they don\u2019t get to go to school. Suzy Amis Cameron: If you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions, what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. If helpful, it can be someone else\u2019s quote. Are there any quotes you can think of or live your life by? James Cameron: Yeah. I\u2019m terrible with quotes and that sort of thing. But I think I would sum up philosophically what I would ask people to do, which is to live in a more connected way, to see yourself as part of a big, global system and know that every action you take has a consequence. Every choice you make as a consumer, whether it\u2019s using plastics or using electricity or replacing that iPhone that\u2019s only six months old because there\u2019s a better one, that that has an impact on somebody somewhere or some animal somewhere or some ecosystem somewhere that \u2013 when I look at the history of the human race up until now \u2013 and this all doesn\u2019t go on the billboard, by the way. I want to try to condense this down. When I look at the history up until now, we\u2019ve been all about expansion. It\u2019s an endless hunger to conquer and expand. And we\u2019ve filled the planet.  We\u2019re like a bacterial culture that rapidly expands to the edge of the petri dish. Well, we\u2019re hitting the edge of the petri dish now. And so everything that always worked throughout human history is not going to work going forward. We\u2019re going to have to have some fundamental change in the way we think. We\u2019re going to have to stop being takers and start being caretakers, or we won\u2019t survive. It\u2019s that simple. Now, maybe it\u2019s 50 years. Maybe it\u2019s 100 years. Maybe it\u2019s 200 years. But it\u2019s not going to go on the way it\u2019s been going on. And we\u2019re going to have to change. And I think it\u2019s a change for the better. It\u2019s a change that\u2019s more empathic. It\u2019s more compassionate. So I guess I would say stop being a taker. Or take less and caretake more. And I mean that very generally, as well.  Think about how decisions that you make and things you do are affecting people in other countries. All those people that are coming up in that big caravan, a lot of them have been displaced by drought. Their farms have collapsed, and they can\u2019t grow their food. It\u2019s not just about drug violence and all that sort of thing, especially in Guatemala. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people on the move from farms that have collapsed due to unprecedented drought that\u2019s drier conditions than they\u2019ve ever had in recorded history and the ability of science to look back hundreds of thousands of years. Well, that\u2019s climate change at work. And if that particular series of droughts is not caused specifically by climate change, it\u2019s a pretty damn good bellwether for what it\u2019s going to look like when hundreds of thousands and then, ultimately, hundreds of millions of people are on the move because of climate change.  So, the choices that we\u2019re making and our energy consumption and our consumption of natural resources and our consumption of foods is impacting other people in other parts of the world. It\u2019ll eventually come back to haunt us with the kinds of political systems that are now taking over all over the world, these protectionist, isolationist, nationalistic, hyper-nationalistic, populist systems that are about closing borders and shutting down and all that sort of thing. I see it all interlinked. And I see it all as a feedback loop that\u2019s just going to get worse and worse. So I would say we have to change this from the inside out, from the way we view the world and our place in it. And so yeah. Stop being a taker. Start being a caretaker. That\u2019s my billboard. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right. When you\u2019re talking about the timeline, the United Nations just came out a couple of weeks ago with a report from the IPCC saying that we have to do something by 2030 to turn things around if we are going to survive on this earth. And one of the things that I really resonate with is the Native American tribes, the First Nations. They always say, \u201cNo matter what you\u2019re doing, realize that it\u2019s going to affect the next seven generations.\u201d So just being really conscious in your everyday actions. And tread lightly on the earth. James Cameron: Yeah. Look, we all struggle to do it. And we don\u2019t want to come off as holier than thou. That\u2019s the thing about vegans in general is they\u2019re all such assholes. Suzy Amis Cameron: Tell your joke. James Cameron: Okay. How many vegans does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re better than you. Right? So the problem is people tend to reject what we could tell them. But I think the answer to that is to say, \u201cOh, well, don\u2019t take our word for it. Read the books. It\u2019s all online.\u201d The problem is that people tend to entrench around their belief systems. And now, with digital news the way it is, we can preselect our inputs to support only what we already believe. And so everybody lives in these isolated echo chambers. And it\u2019s all exacerbated by social media and so on. And so it\u2019s really going to be another thing that we\u2019re going to have to just get a whole lot better at as a species and as a society is checking our facts and looking at alternative opinions and especially, look at the facts that the other guys have, if they have any. See, I just did a little confirmation bias swerve at the end there. \u201cYeah, if they have any.\u201d Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need you to\u2026\u201d Exactly. All right. So next question. What are you currently most excited about? James Cameron: All right. I\u2019m not going to talk about plant-based nutrition other than to say for one second that I was pretty hopeless about being able to get a handle on climate change, just looking at it from an energy perspective and transportation and all that. And when I realized the environmental connection from eating plant-based, I got excited about that. But that\u2019s kind of old news because that\u2019s six years ago for us. I guess right now, I\u2019m excited about the Avatar films. I have the coolest job in the world. I get to go in and create a world, an ecosystem populated with creatures and cool characters and do that all day long and live in that fantasy world. So yeah. I\u2019m pretty excited about it. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. So just to piggyback on feeling hopeful \u2013 because I am going to talk about plant-based eating. Jim actually has a tee-shirt. And one of the lines on it says, \u201cHope is not a strategy.\u201d And he\u2019s a doomsday kind of guy. If you watch his movies, they\u2019re kind of end of the world, apocalyptic. And he never used the word hope. And six and a half years ago, we were walking on the beach. And he said to me, \u201cFor the first time in my life, I feel hopeful.\u201d And needless to say, I almost fell into the surf. But it planted a seed that the more people we can inspire to eat plant-based, the more we can move the needle on climate change. And it was that seed that was planted that made me think about creating content and writing a book. And I\u2019m most excited about the book because \u2013 James Cameron: About your book. Suzy Amis Cameron: About my book. James Cameron: You get to be excited about your book. Suzy Amis Cameron: So it\u2019s OMD: changing one meal a day for the planet. And it starts out with the education of the health \u2013 I worked with a brain trust of doctors. So it\u2019s very, very heavily researched in the medical field around plant-based eating. And then I worked with people from Chatham House and Oxford University and Loma Linda, climate scientist, to help me with the environmental impacts of animal agriculture. And then it\u2019s a guide. It\u2019s a guide of how to do one meal a day or two meals a day or blow up your kitchen like Jim and I did and go cold turkey. It has recipes, shopping lists, meal plans. And I\u2019ll hold your hand. I won\u2019t judge you. It\u2019s not about being perfect. You can keep your burger if you want to. It\u2019s just about one meal a day, OMD. James Cameron: All right. So I think there was one more question. Is that right? Suzy Amis Cameron: There\u2019s one more question. If you had a request, an ask or a suggestion for the listeners of this podcast, what would it be? James Cameron: Oh, I think people that listen to Tim and his guests are looking for hacks to make their life better, to learn how to live in this perplexing world and live better and be smarter. So I think that I would just say read a lot, check your facts, and don\u2019t follow us because we\u2019re so sweet and compelling. Check the facts. Suzy Amis Cameron: Just the facts, ma\u2019am. James Cameron: Yeah. It\u2019s all out there. But I would say also, take the \u2013 be willing to look outside your confirmation bias bubble. And look, I force and challenge myself to do this all the time, to get outside that bubble. And so whatever your beliefs are, ask yourself 1) where they came from. When did you double down on that? And what have you done to look at it from an objective point of view? And I try to do that as much as possible.  When something comes along that I don\u2019t understand, that doesn\u2019t fit my belief system like \u2013 let me just give an example \u2013 like Allan Savory\u2019s approach to regenerative agriculture with grass-fed beef and all the claims that were made around that, I looked into it. And I thought, \u201cWow, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u201d And I went pretty far down the rabbit hole on that and looked at the science on both sides of it and ultimately saw that it wasn\u2019t the right answer. But I didn\u2019t just reject it out of hand because it didn\u2019t fit my belief system. Suzy Amis Cameron: Right. Well, I think my ask would be to take the OMD pledge and pledge one meal a day or two meals a day or go all in because it\u2019ll help your health, it\u2019ll help the planet, it\u2019ll help the animals, your waistline, and your sex life. James Cameron: Yes. Not necessarily in that order. Suzy Amis Cameron: Anyway, thanks, Tim. James Cameron: Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Suzy Amis Cameron: This was really fun. And thanks for having us on. James Cameron: It\u2019s been a pleasure. Thank you. Suzy Amis Cameron: Yeah. Thank you.

pounds in a year, you\u2019re getting that many more opiates", "and you think about \u2013 so you\u2019re just having a glass of milk or cream in your coffee", "but you have yogurt, and it\u2019s condensed that down even more", "james cameron: and cheese is condensed even further", "so it\u2019s sort of bioconcentrating the naturally occurring opiates", "suzy amis cameron: exactly", "and it\u2019s like a block of morphine", "so yeah", "dairy\u2019s really difficult to give up", "but there are so many alternatives now, way more than there were six and a half years ago when we went

getting pretty good", "you can cook with them", "and they have the same texture and mouth feel, cookability, and things like that", "and that\u2019s all just in the last couple of years", "i can\u2019t think of a cheese dish that you can\u2019t duplicate pretty well entirely from plant sources now", "of course, you\u2019re not getting your opiates", "but then you don\u2019t want to be a heroin addict either", "suzy amis cameron: no, but you\u2019ve got a natural high from eating plants already", "so you don\u2019t need it", "james cameron: yeah, right", "exactly", "it makes up for it", "oh, good, baby", "that was nice", "yeah", "but in terms of books, i think this is \u2013 i think we\u2019re supposed to answer more broadly than just about our utter fixation with plant-based nutrition", "another book that i\u2019ve shared a lot is sapiens which is an incredible book that\u2019s got nothing to do with plant-based nutrition", "it\u2019s just an amazing book", "it explains human behavior and why we are the way we are in human civilization from soup to nuts", "and i\u2019ve read it now a couple of times", "it\u2019s a pretty astonishing book", "i\u2019m recommending that", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "i think there\u2019s another book that i recommended so often which was arianna huffington\u2019s book, thrive", "her journey of burning herself out and realizing how important sleep and self-care were \u2013 and it gives you license to take care of yourself in a world that people think that overachievers are triple-type a, that you need to be that way to succeed", "so that\u2019s actually a really good book too", "james cameron: well, you do to an extent", "but you\u2019ve gotta be able to go the distance", "so you gotta pace yourself", "and long-term success is definitely about pacing yourself", "and if i\u2019m going to loop it back to our favorite topic, no", "the kind of energy and stamina and recovery that you get from being a whole food, plant-based eater, it\u2019s what\u2019s gotten me through a year of production", "i\u2019ve never done a year of production in my life", "titanic took six months to shoot", "and we just finished a year because we did avatar 2 and avatar 3 back to back", "and that was one solid year of production", "and i\u2019m feeling great, whereas before, i\u2019d be completely burned out after a six-month shoot and require a month to recover", "suzy amis cameron: well, you got sick a lot on the first one", "flus and colds, and \u2013 james cameron: yeah", "i got sick on avatar", "i got sick on titanic", "and since we went plant-based six and a half years ago, i literally haven\u2019t been sick at all", "like, zero", "not even a sniffle or a cough or a sore throat", "nothing", "so yeah", "it works", "suzy amis cameron: and certainly, being on the road and selling my new book, i know that it\u2019s giving me an edge to be able to pop back and forth between different time zones and things like that, on top of being a mom of five and running a school", "james cameron: to truthfully answer the question, you can\u2019t plug your own book though because he said, \u201cwhat book besides your own\u2026?\u201d suzy amis cameron: oh, right", "sorry", "james cameron: all right", "so what\u2019s the next question", "suzy amis cameron: okay", "we\u2019re going to the next question now", "how has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success", "do you have a favorite failure of yours", "james cameron: oh, well, i don\u2019t think i can answer that question because i\u2019ve never failed at anything", "no", "well, i\u2019ve been lucky on my directed films", "i\u2019ve only had one that underperformed, and that was the abyss", "that wasn\u2019t a hit", "i\u2019ve had produced films that didn\u2019t do well and certainly learned from those", "but my film that i would consider a failure because it wasn\u2019t a hit \u2013 it was a break-even project", "it was quite big in its day", "it was considered i think probably one of the most expensive films ever made in its time, although it\u2019s nothing by present standards \u2013 was the abyss which was released in 1989", " and i think i learned some strong lessons from that about the craft of shaping a story in post-production, and maximizing, and even in the writing", "i learned from that film that the emotional peak came well before the ending", "and then the ending was this ambitious visual overreach", "and i think i couldn\u2019t have made titanic, and titanic wouldn\u2019t have been a hit if i hadn\u2019t done the abyss because on titanic, i kept the abyss in mind", "and i shaped it to have the maximum emotional orchestration to the end of the film and to keep the visual effects in check so that they always served \u2013 the storyline served the narrative and served the characters", "so it took the abyss failing for titanic to be the success that it was i think", "i don\u2019t mean commercial success but artistic success, let\u2019s say", "so yeah", "it\u2019s all a journey", "filmmaking\u2019s a journey", "every film itself is a journey", "but then across the films, the metanarrative that runs across the films is also a journey", "suzy amis cameron: right", "well, i think you always hear failing forward", "and certainly, when the school that i founded with my sister, rebecca amis \u2013 we founded a school called muse school", "and we decided in january of \u201914 that we were going to take the school plant-based because it\u2019s an environmental school", "and we couldn\u2019t call ourselves an environmental school and still be serving animal products", "james cameron: yeah", "it\u2019d be like driving a humvee to work, calling yourself an environmentalist", "it just seemed like such a cognitive dissonance to us that we had to stand for something", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "definitely", "so we decided to take the school plant-based and promptly created a mutiny", "we lost 50% of our families", "and i just thought \u2013 i thought the school was going to close", "james cameron: yeah", "you were surprised", "suzy amis cameron: i didn\u2019t think it was going to succeed", "and it was really nerve-wracking", "but it just felt like the right thing to do", "and ultimately, in the end, we regained our enrollment very quickly", "and we\u2019ve now surpassed it", "and families move from all over the united states", "we even have a couple of families that have moved from out of country to move to calabasas to come to the school because it\u2019s environmental, because it\u2019s passion- and interest-based learning, because it\u2019s plant-based", "so it\u2019s really about trusting your instinct and your gut and doing the right thing, doing something that you think is going to make a difference in life", "james cameron: but we talked about it before we did it", "and i think the final conclusion was, \u201cscrew it", "if it tanks the school, it tanks the school", "but you gotta stand on your principles.\u201d suzy amis cameron: because if you don\u2019t stand for something, you fall for everything", "james cameron: yeah, exactly", "and the thing is that you approached the problem very systematically", "and you set a timetable to do it that was more than a year out", "and you brought in speakers", "you had a speaker series", "and you had town halls and brought the parents in and included them or tried to", "when you talk to people about their food, it\u2019s like talking to them about religion or partisan politics", "people get very entrenched in their belief systems", "and their identity becomes defined by their beliefs", "and they\u2019d rather die than be wrong", "they\u2019d rather be unhealthy than be wrong", "or they\u2019d rather have their kids be unhealthy than be wrong", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "it\u2019s true", "we took 18 months to educate everyone", "and we really went at it from every different angle", "so we brought in doctors", "we brought in climate scientists", "we brought in chefs", "we brought in athletes", "we brought in authors", "we brought in animal rights people", "and they would spend the day with the children", "and then at the end of the day, we would bring the adults in, give them a glass of wine and some beautiful plant-based, delicious food", "and even after all of that, we still had pushback", "james cameron: yeah", "well, it was seen as a top-down push", "and even though you were trying to get buy-in \u2013 and i think a lot of that experience probably \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about failing forward, not only did the school prosper as a result, but if i can swing this back around to your book, i don\u2019t think you would have written omd the way you did, as inclusively as you did if you hadn\u2019t gone through that experience because you realized how people are entrenched in a belief system that\u2019s enculturated", "we all grew up with it", "our parents taught us", "their grandparents taught them", "meat for strength", "milk for bones and teeth and all that sort of thing", "suzy amis cameron: well, that\u2019s a good point because what ended up happening after all of the work that we had done to try to educate people and really give them a way into it, our head of school, jeff king, got very frustrated one day with the parents", "and he said, \u201cpeople, you can give them eggs and bacon in the morning", "and you can give them a burger at night", "it\u2019s one meal a day", "it\u2019s omd.\u201d and so muse \u2013 james cameron: that\u2019s where omd came from", "suzy amis cameron: that\u2019s where omd came from", "it was born there", "and that\u2019s when i took that idea and wrote a book around the idea of it", "james cameron: yeah", "are you down with omd", "yeah", "but it\u2019s great because it\u2019s inclusive, because it understands that people \u2013 i think they fall into two categories", "you\u2019ve got very close-minded people that won\u2019t even listen, and then you\u2019ve got people that have actually read enough and heard enough to realize that it would be beneficial to them but don\u2019t think they can do it, but are curious about it and maybe want to try it", "and the great thing about omd is it\u2019s one meal a day", "and if you make that pledge, not only are you cutting your carbon footprint and your environmental footprint significantly, but you\u2019re starting to feel some delta", "there\u2019s going to be some change in the way that you feel, and in your health, and so on", "and you get to see how relatively easy it is", "and it\u2019s not that big a deal", "the fear of it is greater than the actual process of doing it", "suzy amis cameron: well, i think that that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a \u2013 it\u2019s a non-judgmental \u2013 it\u2019s not about perfection", "it\u2019s just one meal and realizing how empowering it is for one person to be able to make a difference in your carbon footprint and your water footprint", "so one person eating one plant-based meal for one year saves 200,000 gallons of water and the carbon equivalent of driving from los angeles to new york", "and people don\u2019t realize that animal agriculture is the second leading cause of greenhouse gases, more than all transportation combined", "so you can make more of a difference for the environment by what you\u2019re putting on your plate than the kind of car you\u2019re driving", "james cameron: yeah", "look, electrification of transportation system is critical in the long-run just like changing to renewable energy is critical", "but these are things that take time", "and something you can do immediately, instantaneously \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be able to afford to buy a hybrid or a plug-in hybrid \u2013 is change what you eat", "it\u2019s very simple", "it brings the power back to the individual", "now you know you\u2019re living right with nature, that you\u2019re not one of the millions of people that\u2019s responsible for cutting down an acre of rainforest a second in brazil which is what\u2019s happening right now to make room for crop land", "everybody thinks, \u201cwhy is the environmental footprint so high for cattle?\u201d it\u2019s not what the cattle are eating", "it\u2019s not the water that the cattle are drinking so much", " it\u2019s the fact that so much deforestation and misuse of land is taking place to grow crops to feed the cattle, whereas the efficiency factor for humans eating the grains and the plants directly is, depending on where the cattle are growing and who the people are and all that sort of thing, it ranges from 20 to 40 times more efficient in terms of land-use", "if everybody on earth eats the way we do collectively here in the us, were to do that and our population continues to grow to nine billion, as is projected by 2050, we need four planet earths", "we\u2019re already way into overshoo \u2013 we\u2019re already way past sustainability already with the number of people we have and with the number of people that are still not eating the way we do", "so there\u2019s a sort of a social justice aspect to it as well, if you think about it", "those people that don\u2019t eat like us can\u2019t eat like us", "it will not be allowed by the laws of nature", " there\u2019s a social justice issue to this in addition to the environmental issue and the animal rights issue and all that", "so that\u2019s on the negative side", "but on the positive side, the thing that\u2019s great about this is not only is your health going to improve", "but if you\u2019re an athlete or even just a casual athlete, play tennis, whatever, your performance is going to improve greatly", "got another question there", "we rambled all over the place", "suzy amis cameron: next question: what are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise", "james cameron: well, the one recommendation that i hear all the time that\u2019s given to kids and everything is, \u201cdo what you love.\u201d and i would modify that strongly", "do what you love that is also something people will pay you for", "suzy amis cameron: right, which is what you have found out how to do very successfully", "james cameron: yeah", "right", "i get to do what i love", "and i love making films", "i love all the things that i spend time on, exploration and all that", "people don\u2019t pay you to be an explorer", "i can say that", "you go do something that you love and make money", "then you go get to do something that you love that people won\u2019t pay you for, like deep ocean exploration because there is no money in that game whatsoever", "but what other recommendation", "well, look", "the question was your profession or field of expertise", "so we know a lot about plant-based nutrition", "so i\u2019m going to vector it back to that", "there are so many \u2013 suzy amis cameron: well, i have a certification through ecornell", "james cameron: yeah", "that\u2019s right", "you\u2019re a certified nutritionist", "so many bad recommendations in nutrition", "and doctors make them all the time", "doctors tell you to build yourself up by eating meat", "suzy amis cameron: it\u2019s not their fault, either", "it\u2019s just the way they\u2019ve been trained", "james cameron: or not trained because they don\u2019t study nutrition", "i was talking to a doctor the other day who\u2019s on a cardiology path", "he\u2019s still in university", "said, \u201chow much nutritional training have you had?\u201d because i had said in a public speaking thing they only get about somewhere between an hour and a day total of nutritional training through seven years of med school", "and he said, \u201cabout an hour.\u201d and so doctors are myth-propagators these days, the myth that you need meat for protein", "in fact, interestingly enough, the vast majority of doctors conflate the term protein and meat, like it is one thing", "certainly, meat is a source of protein", "that\u2019s about all that\u2019s in it besides protein and fat as opposed to plants being a source of protein and a source of minerals and phytonutrients and micronutrients of all kinds and trace elements and all sorts of stuff", "suzy amis cameron: but people don\u2019t think that protein is in vegetables", "there\u2019s protein in iceberg lettuce", "james cameron: where did the cow get it", "it\u2019s pretty simple", "so the truth with animal proteins is that they\u2019re not \u2013 it\u2019s not just that they\u2019re inefficient for the environment and that they come packaged with an awful lot of fat, but that the actual biomolecular structure of the protein is not healthy for humans", "and i know there are probably a lot of paleo eaters in the audience for this podcast", "and, we all tend to live in a confirmation-bias kind of environment where we seek out the information that confirms what we want to know", "but i would encourage them to look into what plant-based nutritionists are saying about meat proteins and what real paleoanthropologists are saying about what ancient humans ate", "but we\u2019re not adapted for a diet of meat", "we can eat meat", "meat was a killer app back in the ice age when the plants were covered by snow all the time", "you could die out if you were a vegetarian", " and when we, collectively, the human species migrated up into northern europe which was where they didn\u2019t have any competition \u2013 there was plenty of competition in africa", "as you started to move up into northern europe, you got into virgin territory", "and that\u2019s why we migrated up there and lost our melanin, got pale-skinned and learned to adapt to the cold and all that stuff", "you weren\u2019t going to make it through the winter if you were 100% plant-based which is why you don\u2019t have a lot of gorillas in scotland", "so yeah", "it was a killer app", "it allowed the expansion of the human species", "but we weren\u2019t initially evolutionarily selected to do it", "that\u2019s a more recent thing", "suzy amis cameron: well, i think the other myth too is that men really feel like they need that meat protein in order to be manly", "and you just had great success showing game changers to your whole crew down on the set of avatar because it\u2019s full of elite male athletes", "it\u2019s got female athletes in there as well", "james cameron: i gotta just interject", "the game changers is a film that suzy and i just executive produced that was directed by louis psihoyos", "it\u2019s not out yet", "but we think it\u2019s going to make a profound difference in this male myth of meat proteins", "but anyway, carry on", "sorry", "suzy amis cameron: yeah, because men believe that they need the meat to be manly", "and it\u2019s quite the antithesis", "and you saw an unbelievable reaction with your crew", "the set of avatar is actually the first plant-based catered set ever", "and so they\u2019re doing one meal a day and saving an enormous amount of water and carbon", "james cameron: yeah", "we give them great food", "it\u2019s about 200 people between our technical team and our production group and so on", "suzy amis cameron: but now, it\u2019s like there\u2019s a line out the door since you showed the movie", "james cameron: well, yeah", "it was hysterical because a year ago, we went plant-based on the production because we wanted to be the greenest production ever", "and we have our own solar power", "we have a one megawatt solar power facility on the roof", "and the idea was that \u2013 i sat the whole team down and said, \u201cguys, if we\u2019re going to make these films that stand for something about the environment and our relationship with nature, we have to walk the walk", "so we\u2019re going to do a green set", "and the way to do a green set is the same way suzy did the green school", "so we\u2019re going to go one meal a day", "we\u2019re going to eat plant-based for our lunch", "and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to cater.\u201d and it wasn\u2019t a dictatorship", "people could always go across the street to any of the many restaurants in the area, fast food joints in the area", "it\u2019s in an urban area", "we\u2019re not out in the woods", " \u201cbut if you want to eat the free food, then it\u2019s going to be plant-based", "and hopefully, you\u2019ll see that it can be not only nourishing but fun and yummy", "and we\u2019ll have thai noodles", "and we\u2019ll have lasagna", "and we\u2019ll have pizza", "and we\u2019ll have all the stuff you love", "it just will be from plant-based sources.\u201d so they\u2019ve done that for a year", "but it dropped down to where maybe we\u2019d only have half attendance at lunch", "the day we screened game changers \u2013 and everybody was asked to show up", "we did it on company time", "that lunch, they ran out of food because everybody showed up", "we had so many converts after seeing that film", "and at least 20 people have come to me in the weeks since and said, \u201ci\u2019ve made the decision", "i\u2019m doing this", "i\u2019m going plant-based.\u201d or, \u201ci\u2019m going to do a 21-day challenge.\u201d or, \u201ci\u2019m a week in", "and i feel great.\u201d all that stuff", " of course, it\u2019s all anecdotal", "but if we\u2019d thought about it, we could have done a before and after study, a proper scientific study because we\u2019ve got a big enough cohort", "we\u2019ve got a couple hundred people", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "exactly", "well, i know that the chefs are happy with everybody lining up to eat the yummy food", "and it is", "it\u2019s delicious", "next question", "james cameron: next question", "suzy amis cameron: okay", "in the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life", "james cameron: can we stretch the envelope to six and half years", "because that\u2019s how long we\u2019ve been plant-based", "suzy amis cameron: i know", "well, i was planning on doing that anyway because it\u2019s been \u2013 it absolutely changed our lives, not only from a health point of view but understanding the whole mental impact", "but it\u2019s also affected what our investments are", "and everything that we do, every decision that we make, every request that we have goes through that lens of plant-based eating", "james cameron: sure", "we built a factory up in canada", "there\u2019s a company called verdient that makes plant-based proteins from yellow peas and lentils", "and it\u2019s one of the largest dry protein processing plants in canada", "so that was an investment decision that was guided by our epiphany", "suzy amis cameron: right", "and now, we\u2019re using those plant proteins to actually work with the food center \u2013 james cameron: in saskatchewan", "suzy amis cameron: right", "in saskatchewan at the university of saskatchewan and create food products", "so i\u2019m going to be rolling out omd food products in early \u201919", "they\u2019re making things like ginger beef and pulled pork and cheeses and pasta sauces and snacks", "james cameron: yeah", "so there will be a whole omd line, a whole bunch of different skews on that", "so yeah", "so it had a profound impact on us", "and that was one single change, habit change, behavior change", "suzy amis cameron: right", "i know that i have certainly found my purpose in life", "and it\u2019s what propelled me to write a book which has completely changed the trajectory of what i was doing", "i was going into education and schools", "but interestingly enough, it has fed into that because now, muse school is being launched worldwide, muse global", "and all of those schools will be omd schools", "they\u2019ll all have the same philosophy that we carry at muse prime", "james cameron: well, it\u2019s resonated beautifully because the muse school cafeteria was voted the greenest restaurant in the world", "so apparently, there\u2019s a competition for the world\u2019s greenest restaurant", "and all the big snooty, urban, seat to table restaurants all hope to win", "and this little, humble, elementary school cafeteria beat them all by like, 400 points because the school is solar powered", "and all the produce is grown \u2013 or most of the produce is grown on site", "and the building was built out of repurposed building materials", "it\u2019s like you literally ticked every box just by walking the walk and because it\u2019s plant-based", "so it\u2019s got a \u2013 a 100% plant-based eater has one-third of the carbon footprint of a standard american diet eater, meaning a meat-eater", "so yeah", "so you kicked their butts", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "we did", "we had had three out of four stars for a long time", "but when we went plant-based, it just really jettisoned us out", "and we beat the restaurant in chicago", "james cameron: we\u2019re not going to name names", "but they\u2019re all high end", "suzy amis cameron: no", "exactly", "all right", "so next question", "james cameron: sure", "suzy amis cameron: okay", "when you feel overwhelmed or unfocused or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do", "if helpful, what questions do you ask yourself", "james cameron: so what do i do when i feel overwhelmed", "i clean off my desk because when i\u2019m working at a high pace, everything piles up", "and just the act of cleaning off my desk, it\u2019s like a reset", "it\u2019s like power cycling a computer", "it\u2019s a reboot", "and i usually find that about half the stuff that\u2019s accumulated, i can throw out", "and the other half, i have to put in piles", "i have to put them in the right place", "so now i\u2019m prioritizing", "now i\u2019m thinking, \u201coh, well, that\u2019s still important.\u201d so i think that if you\u2019re a team leader, you\u2019ve gotta get your own priorities straight before you can generate priorities for the team", "and i\u2019ve found that whenever i hit one of those moments, i also find it\u2019s great to take a day off or even half a day off", "just force yourself to take a day off not to go play but to just reorganize and just write down the series of priorities or memos to yourself", " and out of that, i typically will generate things that i hand out to my team to give them their marching orders to get us back on track", "and it\u2019s amazing how things just pop into focus and solutions present themselves because i haven\u2019t stopped running, i haven\u2019t gotten off the treadmill until that moment to lift my head out of the day-to-day battle, to think about, \u201cwell, how are we going to really win this war?\u201d because something like a big film production is like a campaign that takes place over sometimes a period of years", "and if you don\u2019t take a moment out to look at the big picture \u2013 so most of the major strategic decisions that i\u2019ve made during the productions of the two avatar films so far over the last couple of years have come from that down day, that catch-up day", " it\u2019s not about taking a day off or taking a nap", "that\u2019s a good idea too", "and go swim or play with the kids or whatever", "you gotta do that too", "but just take a day for yourself with no distractions to just get everything in order", "that helps me a lot", "if nothing else, i just feel better about it", "i come in", "there\u2019s a clean desk", "\u201chere\u2019s some memos", "you guys go do the work.\u201d suzy amis cameron: well, i think we\u2019re really similar on that", "i have a tendency to walk through the house and get ridiculously overwhelmed with all the kids and the cats and the dogs and the bearded dragon and the people", "and so i always like to go in and just reorganize the house", "but i always start with my office as well", "and i like to take a big piece of typing paper and write out \u2013 i create columns", "and i write out all my emails that i need to do and all my calls that i need to do", "and then there\u2019s a whole section in there just for household thing \u2013 james cameron: lists are good", "suzy amis cameron: \u2013 and work things and all of those", "and i know that the children are learning this as well because when they \u2013 of course, they roll their eyes when i walk in and say, \u201cokay", "we\u2019re going to take a clean day, an organizing day", "and here are some boxes for giveaways.\u201d they roll their eyes", "but in the end, they love it", "and they feel better", "james cameron: yeah", "they get into it", "suzy amis cameron: and they get into it", "so it\u2019s the same sort of thing", "and taking a walk and then realizing, \u201cokay", "what is the first thing i can do that\u2019s going to get me on that journey towards my goal?\u201d but always keeping that goal in mind of whatever that is", "james cameron: sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to walk away from it for a second", "it\u2019s counterintuitive for us type a types that just bash our heads against the problem all day long, \u201cboom, boom, boom, boom,\u201d \u2013 suzy amis cameron: right", "we\u2019re triple-a", "james cameron: \u2013 day after day", "i had an epiphany while i was writing avatar", "i was working down in new zealand", "office was in the country", "and i was just having a \u2013 it was just impossible to solve some of the dramatic problems", "i couldn\u2019t solve it", "i couldn\u2019t fix the script", "and i was sitting", "and i just walked away", "i sat down", "sat outside", "and there was a glass cover to the veranda", "and i watched this big fly", "and he was trying to get out", "and he was banging against the glass", "and he just kept hitting the glass over and over and over and over because that\u2019s how his little chip was programmed", "you go toward the light", "you go toward the sky", "and he couldn\u2019t get to the sky", "all he had to do was drop down, fly three feet sideways, and come out", "but he couldn\u2019t process it", " and i thought, \u201chow often am i that fly", "how often is there some higher level of perspective that i lack in my chip that i\u2019m missing that is so simple that some fourth dimensional being could look at the problem and go, \u2018oh, you idiot", "you just drop down, go over three feet, and you\u2019re out.\u2019\u201d but the fly couldn\u2019t do it", "and i thought, \u201cwell, what am i not seeing?\u201d and that\u2019s when i went back to first principles", "and i looked at the whole thing from a higher level", "i got out of the trenches for that moment", "and that\u2019s how i solved the problem", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "i think also, too, is learning when to recognize when you\u2019re hitting that window and also learning to recognize when it\u2019s the path of least resistance because you know you\u2019re on the right path when doors just continue to open up", "james cameron: well, that\u2019s true", "that\u2019s the opposite", "that\u2019s the other thing", "it\u2019s important to recognize when things are breaking your way", "when you have momentum, when you\u2019re not hitting the glass, you take advantage of it", "and you ride that tailwind", "suzy amis cameron: but there\u2019s a difference too", "it\u2019s when you know you want to do something and you feel really strongly about it and you have a lot of people around you saying, \u201cno,\u201d and, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d and, \u201cit\u2019s going to be too hard.\u201d i know it works for you that way", "but that just lights an inferno under my butt", "it\u2019s like, \u201cokay", "really", "no", "watch me.\u201d james cameron: yeah", "i\u2019d love to say that to my team on avatar", "\u201coh, well, we shouldn\u2019t do that, guys because that\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d when they know coming in when they sign up that it\u2019s going to be the most difficult production in human history just by its nature where every blade of grass in the entire world that we\u2019re creating is created by somebody, by a computer artist or by some kind of algorithm that\u2019s self-growing or whatever", " you know by definition it\u2019s going to be hard", "you\u2019re there because it\u2019s hard", "you\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s hard because that\u2019s how you measure yourself against that challenge", "and that\u2019s why everybody that\u2019s on the avatar team is there because they know it\u2019s going to be the hardest motherfucker they ever work on", "and they want that", "now, they\u2019ll all go whine about it later and say, \u201cthat was the hardest motherfucker i ever worked on.\u201d and that\u2019s why i have this reputation as a cruel taskmaster", "but in fact, they\u2019ve all showed up because they want to do that", "they want to climb that mountain", "suzy amis cameron: and they\u2019ve learned from it, like the teachers at muse", "they\u2019re teaching in a way they\u2019ve never \u2013 nobody teaches that way", "and it\u2019s really challenging", "but they learn", "james cameron: yeah", "the kids don\u2019t like holidays because they don\u2019t get to go to school", "suzy amis cameron: if you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions, what would it say and why", "it could be a few words or a paragraph", "if helpful, it can be someone else\u2019s quote", "are there any quotes you can think of or live your life by", "james cameron: yeah", "i\u2019m terrible with quotes and that sort of thing", "but i think i would sum up philosophically what i would ask people to do, which is to live in a more connected way, to see yourself as part of a big, global system and know that every action you take has a consequence", "every choice you make as a consumer, whether it\u2019s using plastics or using electricity or replacing that iphone that\u2019s only six months old because there\u2019s a better one, that that has an impact on somebody somewhere or some animal somewhere or some ecosystem somewhere that \u2013 when i look at the history of the human race up until now \u2013 and this all doesn\u2019t go on the billboard, by the way", "i want to try to condense this down", "when i look at the history up until now, we\u2019ve been all about expansion", "it\u2019s an endless hunger to conquer and expand", "and we\u2019ve filled the planet", " we\u2019re like a bacterial culture that rapidly expands to the edge of the petri dish", "well, we\u2019re hitting the edge of the petri dish now", "and so everything that always worked throughout human history is not going to work going forward", "we\u2019re going to have to have some fundamental change in the way we think", "we\u2019re going to have to stop being takers and start being caretakers, or we won\u2019t survive", "it\u2019s that simple", "now, maybe it\u2019s 50 years", "maybe it\u2019s 100 years", "maybe it\u2019s 200 years", "but it\u2019s not going to go on the way it\u2019s been going on", "and we\u2019re going to have to change", "and i think it\u2019s a change for the better", "it\u2019s a change that\u2019s more empathic", "it\u2019s more compassionate", "so i guess i would say stop being a taker", "or take less and caretake more", "and i mean that very generally, as well", " think about how decisions that you make and things you do are affecting people in other countries", "all those people that are coming up in that big caravan, a lot of them have been displaced by drought", "their farms have collapsed, and they can\u2019t grow their food", "it\u2019s not just about drug violence and all that sort of thing, especially in guatemala", "there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people on the move from farms that have collapsed due to unprecedented drought that\u2019s drier conditions than they\u2019ve ever had in recorded history and the ability of science to look back hundreds of thousands of years", "well, that\u2019s climate change at work", "and if that particular series of droughts is not caused specifically by climate change, it\u2019s a pretty damn good bellwether for what it\u2019s going to look like when hundreds of thousands and then, ultimately, hundreds of millions of people are on the move because of climate change", " so, the choices that we\u2019re making and our energy consumption and our consumption of natural resources and our consumption of foods is impacting other people in other parts of the world", "it\u2019ll eventually come back to haunt us with the kinds of political systems that are now taking over all over the world, these protectionist, isolationist, nationalistic, hyper-nationalistic, populist systems that are about closing borders and shutting down and all that sort of thing", "i see it all interlinked", "and i see it all as a feedback loop that\u2019s just going to get worse and worse", "so i would say we have to change this from the inside out, from the way we view the world and our place in it", "and so yeah", "stop being a taker", "start being a caretaker", "that\u2019s my billboard", "suzy amis cameron: right", "when you\u2019re talking about the timeline, the united nations just came out a couple of weeks ago with a report from the ipcc saying that we have to do something by 2030 to turn things around if we are going to survive on this earth", "and one of the things that i really resonate with is the native american tribes, the first nations", "they always say, \u201cno matter what you\u2019re doing, realize that it\u2019s going to affect the next seven generations.\u201d so just being really conscious in your everyday actions", "and tread lightly on the earth", "james cameron: yeah", "look, we all struggle to do it", "and we don\u2019t want to come off as holier than thou", "that\u2019s the thing about vegans in general is they\u2019re all such assholes", "suzy amis cameron: tell your joke", "james cameron: okay", "how many vegans does it take to screw in a lightbulb", "doesn\u2019t matter", "we\u2019re better than you", "right", "so the problem is people tend to reject what we could tell them", "but i think the answer to that is to say, \u201coh, well, don\u2019t take our word for it", "read the books", "it\u2019s all online.\u201d the problem is that people tend to entrench around their belief systems", "and now, with digital news the way it is, we can preselect our inputs to support only what we already believe", "and so everybody lives in these isolated echo chambers", "and it\u2019s all exacerbated by social media and so on", "and so it\u2019s really going to be another thing that we\u2019re going to have to just get a whole lot better at as a species and as a society is checking our facts and looking at alternative opinions and especially, look at the facts that the other guys have, if they have any", "see, i just did a little confirmation bias swerve at the end there", "\u201cyeah, if they have any.\u201d suzy amis cameron: yeah", "\u201cwe\u2019re going to need you to\u2026\u201d exactly", "all right", "so next question", "what are you currently most excited about", "james cameron: all right", "i\u2019m not going to talk about plant-based nutrition other than to say for one second that i was pretty hopeless about being able to get a handle on climate change, just looking at it from an energy perspective and transportation and all that", "and when i realized the environmental connection from eating plant-based, i got excited about that", "but that\u2019s kind of old news because that\u2019s six years ago for us", "i guess right now, i\u2019m excited about the avatar films", "i have the coolest job in the world", "i get to go in and create a world, an ecosystem populated with creatures and cool characters and do that all day long and live in that fantasy world", "so yeah", "i\u2019m pretty excited about it", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "so just to piggyback on feeling hopeful \u2013 because i am going to talk about plant-based eating", "jim actually has a tee-shirt", "and one of the lines on it says, \u201chope is not a strategy.\u201d and he\u2019s a doomsday kind of guy", "if you watch his movies, they\u2019re kind of end of the world, apocalyptic", "and he never used the word hope", "and six and a half years ago, we were walking on the beach", "and he said to me, \u201cfor the first time in my life, i feel hopeful.\u201d and needless to say, i almost fell into the surf", "but it planted a seed that the more people we can inspire to eat plant-based, the more we can move the needle on climate change", "and it was that seed that was planted that made me think about creating content and writing a book", "and i\u2019m most excited about the book because \u2013 james cameron: about your book", "suzy amis cameron: about my book", "james cameron: you get to be excited about your book", "suzy amis cameron: so it\u2019s omd: changing one meal a day for the planet", "and it starts out with the education of the health \u2013 i worked with a brain trust of doctors", "so it\u2019s very, very heavily researched in the medical field around plant-based eating", "and then i worked with people from chatham house and oxford university and loma linda, climate scientist, to help me with the environmental impacts of animal agriculture", "and then it\u2019s a guide", "it\u2019s a guide of how to do one meal a day or two meals a day or blow up your kitchen like jim and i did and go cold turkey", "it has recipes, shopping lists, meal plans", "and i\u2019ll hold your hand", "i won\u2019t judge you", "it\u2019s not about being perfect", "you can keep your burger if you want to", "it\u2019s just about one meal a day, omd", "james cameron: all right", "so i think there was one more question", "is that right", "suzy amis cameron: there\u2019s one more question", "if you had a request, an ask or a suggestion for the listeners of this podcast, what would it be", "james cameron: oh, i think people that listen to tim and his guests are looking for hacks to make their life better, to learn how to live in this perplexing world and live better and be smarter", "so i think that i would just say read a lot, check your facts, and don\u2019t follow us because we\u2019re so sweet and compelling", "check the facts", "suzy amis cameron: just the facts, ma\u2019am", "james cameron: yeah", "it\u2019s all out there", "but i would say also, take the \u2013 be willing to look outside your confirmation bias bubble", "and look, i force and challenge myself to do this all the time, to get outside that bubble", "and so whatever your beliefs are, ask yourself 1) where they came from", "when did you double down on that", "and what have you done to look at it from an objective point of view", "and i try to do that as much as possible", " when something comes along that i don\u2019t understand, that doesn\u2019t fit my belief system like \u2013 let me just give an example \u2013 like allan savory\u2019s approach to regenerative agriculture with grass-fed beef and all the claims that were made around that, i looked into it", "and i thought, \u201cwow, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u201d and i went pretty far down the rabbit hole on that and looked at the science on both sides of it and ultimately saw that it wasn\u2019t the right answer", "but i didn\u2019t just reject it out of hand because it didn\u2019t fit my belief system", "suzy amis cameron: right", "well, i think my ask would be to take the omd pledge and pledge one meal a day or two meals a day or go all in because it\u2019ll help your health, it\u2019ll help the planet, it\u2019ll help the animals, your waistline, and your sex life", "james cameron: yes", "not necessarily in that order", "suzy amis cameron: anyway, thanks, tim", "james cameron: yeah", "thanks, tim", "suzy amis cameron: this was really fun", "and thanks for having us on", "james cameron: it\u2019s been a pleasure", "thank you", "suzy amis cameron: yeah", "thank you"]}
