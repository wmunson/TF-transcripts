Nick Kokonas: Thanks, Tim. Awesome to be here finally. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, we have the benefit of having spent some time together, and I have been fed a lot of caffeine by you. You were also of great help with The 4-Hour Chef. So I wanted to, right off the bat, thank you for that. It was a lovely experience. Nick Kokonas: It was kind of a fun thing, because I remember when you sent me out a preview of the book, and then you called me to say, \u201cHey, do you want to say anything about it? I was on a chairlift. I was like, \u201cBy the time I get off this chairlift, I will have a blurb for you.\u201d It was such pressure.  Tim Ferriss: Which meant a lot. Pressure, I think, is the word to describe so much about you and your life\u2026 I want to say \u201ctrajectory,\u201d but I\u2019m not even sure that is the right word. I thought a fun way to kick off the conversation would be to share with people listening some of the back-and-forth we had when we were brainstorming what a podcast might look like. Because certainly I don\u2019t think of you first and foremost as a food guy, per se. We were having this exchange via text and then via email. I thought I\u2019d just read one of your responses as we were swapping different ideas. I\u2019ll probably edit for space a little bit here, but not by much. Here we go.  \u201cI\u2019m a huge believer in radical transparency in business. I give numbers and burn bridges with big companies because I think that a lot of times, people don\u2019t ask the basic questions in publishing. For instance, how much did that book cost to print? How many did it sell? Oddly, those numbers are very hard to come by. I dug from months, years ago to do the Alinea book the right way. For bars \u2013 why does a bartender wash dishes and talk to customers? We\u2019ve redesigned the bar experience in one best bar in the world. For restaurants \u2013 why is it the only form of entertainment that has only mutual promise to show up? Then it goes into behavioral economics. And in parentheses, I don\u2019t even know how to pronounce this last name correctly, Richard Thaler or is it Taylor? Nick Kokonas: Yeah, Thaler.  Tim Ferriss: \u201cRichard Thaler is a friend and investor. Just won the Nobel Prize. Investing. Been beating the market for nearly 30 years. EVERYTHING (in all caps) is about asymmetric risk taking and information, and yet people\u2019s perception of risk or of what I do is that it\u2019s risky. It is not.\u201d  In a separate exchange, when we were talking about many of the topics that you could talk about outside of restaurants, bars, and so on, even though that\u2019s been a big part of your life in recent history, many of these different experiments, explorations, portions of your career, topics that you could talk about, and then going into what you said, \u201cThey come down to a single thought really. Wherever there is opaque information that should be obvious, run to that gap.\u201d  I struggle with where to even begin with the 20 options that we have here. But maybe you can explain to me how behavioral economics and Richard Thaler fit into this? Just for curiosity\u2019s sake.  Nick Kokonas: I\u2019ll go back to the word you used, \u201coptions.\u201d Because I started out back in 1992 or 1993 studying options trading, derivatives trading. I think there\u2019s a huge misconception about what that is because of movies, because of The Big Short, because of Wall Street, and all of that. It\u2019s a bit like playing a game of chess for a living, or being the house at a casino, that sort of thing. It\u2019s about taking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of decisions per day and pretending it\u2019s like a big decision tree. Any given decision is probably, if you\u2019re really good, at a 48 percent chance of being wrong. So, you have to be really, really good at constantly being comfortable being wrong, but knowing that your overall number of decisions that you\u2019re going to be right more than you\u2019re wrong.  I know there\u2019s a big theme with a lot of the folks you have on. They talk about success or failure, how to measure those things. I don\u2019t look at it as success or failure with anything. I look at it as just like, is my pattern of decisions correct? Then getting back to your actual question with Professor Thaler and behavioral economics. Essentially what they\u2019re looking at is decision making. What drives people to make certain decisions. What\u2019s rational about those decisions. What is mostly irrational or emotional. Or what decisions do we make that people don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re making a decision? Which is often the case as well.  Then, if you think about it, every single form of what we do \u2013 art, commerce, science, picking a mate, all those things \u2013 comes down to a whole bunch of decisions you make without often thinking about the decision itself. Not that you can walk around going, \u201cWhoa, I\u2019ve just made another decision.\u201d But when you are doing business, or starting a company, or publishing a book, or whatever it might be, you can be intentional about that and realize that it\u2019s going to be an iterative process. I think that\u2019s been not only the case for me in learning how to filter things through that mindset, but when you said there isn\u2019t a trajectory, I look at everything I\u2019ve done as the same, in a way. Even though other people look at it and go, \u201cWow, you went from being a derivatives trader to owning a restaurant, that\u2019s weird.\u201d I studied philosophy in college. People are like, \u201cHow do you go from philosophy to finance?\u201d To me, it was all the same thing.  Tim Ferriss: That particular transition or rather, progression, I suppose, from philosophy to finance is one that you and I haven\u2019t really talked about. That one is interesting. I\u2019d love to explore for a second. We\u2019re going to go into a million different nooks and crannies, but did you feel like studying philosophy undergrad was an asset that then later helped you? Or was it just an interest you explored en route to other things?  Nick Kokonas: I can\u2019t remotely imagine having not done that. The way actually I did it was really interesting. I had no intention. When I got to college, I thought I\u2019d study political science, economics, pre-law kind of thing, something like that. My very second week at Colgate University, a wonderful professor who just passed away last year at 94 years old, a really great mentor to me, Professor Jerome Balmuth. He was a tenured professor at Colgate for almost 60 years. He pulled me aside. Introduction to Logic 101. He basically said, \u201cWhat are you studying here?\u201d I told him and he said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re going to be a philosophy major. I\u2019m going to teach you how to think.\u201d  He was the kind of guy \u2013 there\u2019s this great scene in A River Runs Through It, where the dad every time the kid writes an essay, the young fisherman kid writes an essay, and he brings it to his father to be graded, he gives it back to him and says, \u201cHalf as long again.\u201d Long before that movie ever came out, Professor Balmuth would essentially assign a paper to the class and say, \u201cIt should be about 15 pages.\u201d People would be like, \u201cHow long?\u201d He\u2019d say, \u201cHow long is a piece of string? It\u2019s however long it needs to be.\u201d Then he would tell me, \u201cYours can\u2019t be longer than three pages.\u201d  People would be jealous. Like, \u201cWow, you only have to write three pages.\u201d If you take it seriously, that is a much, much harder thing to do. He really trained me, as well as a number of other professors there, to be clear in thinking, succinct, to understand what logic was, to process information, and really to look for parallels in different fields and different field of thought. Man, when I got out of school, I went to law school for like a day and a half. I had gotten into Penn, like a joint J.D./Ph.D. program at Penn. As soon as I knew who the other folks were and what their desires and trajectories were, I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t actually a good fit for me.\u201d  I remember my future father-in-law told my now-wife, then-girlfriend, that I was in danger of becoming an intellectual bum, because I dropped out of law school before I really entered law school. I floundered around for a little while. But if you grow up in Chicago, you end up meeting people who had this unusual lifestyle. That was back in the days pre-internet, pre-electronic trading, pre-high-frequency trading, where there were literally people on the giant trading floor shouting at each other. You either were attracted to the almost animalistic nature of that. For me, it was a huge challenge, because there were people down there that had Ph.D.s from MIT, then there were people who were butchers that went down there with $100,000 and just kicked ass.  It wasn\u2019t about your level of education or any of the stuff I already talked about. It was about, \u201cCan you show up every day?\u201d Every day is game day. Be really disciplined and very clear-headed with chaos around you.  Tim Ferriss: How did you get introduced to that world? Nick Kokonas: If you grow up in Chicago, you know some of these guys. Some of them are flashy. I can remember the exact moment, and I\u2019m not going to name a name here, as you\u2019ll find out why in a second, but I was walking down the street. I was six months out of college, didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. I was walking down the street and I bumped into a guy I knew in high school. He wasn\u2019t the best student. He didn\u2019t try the hardest. I was like, \u201cHey what are you doing now?\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just rehabbing these homes.\u201d I thought, \u201cLiterally, he\u2019s a construction worker.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat are you doing with them?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I just bought this block. I\u2019m turning this all over.\u201d  This is a true story. This is so not like a good reason to do something. But I looked at him, and I was like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I skipped college. I started as a runner on the Merc, and now I own 25 condos and three townhomes and I trade.\u201d I kind of went like, \u201cWow.\u201d I don\u2019t know what \u2013 I knew a little bit about it. I\u2019d been down on the floor before, just visiting. I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s fascinating. That is a truly fascinating thing.\u201d I went down and visited the floor. I had to fake my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the wrong direction to get a job. True story. People lie on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time. I\u2019m probably the only person that got rid of my degree and my academic awards and all that.  To get a clerk job on the floor, the last thing they wanted was someone with a good degree, Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude, all that stuff. I faked my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, got a $5 an hour job, and looked for a mentor. I found a guy named Frank Zarino, who was at Chicago Research and Trading, which also was founded by a philosophy major. It\u2019s actually very common.  Tim Ferriss: Why is that common? Nick Kokonas: I wish I knew the answer. I don\u2019t know the answer. I do know that there\u2019s three or four of the largest trading firms in the world are run by philosophy majors. If you look back at my class, there\u2019s a few professors in there, but there are people who make movies, there\u2019s a guy who runs an ad agency, a large ad agency. It\u2019s a really interesting path. It\u2019s not just dislike studying physics. I know some great physicists who are great in whatever they do. I think it\u2019s a similar discipline of abstract thought. I can\u2019t think of anything worse than studying business. It just seems like a terrible thing to study to me.  Tim Ferriss: Is that because it\u2019s like the surface of the waves in the ocean topically? It\u2019s just so non-transferable in a sense? Then as you go lower and lower through the slower moving layers, that\u2019s just more multidisciplinary in terms of studying the basics of how things work or how people think?  Nick Kokonas: Yeah. It\u2019s almost like how to do something or how to manage something, but not why to do it. And so, if you\u2019re taught in 1992, if I went and got an MBA, I would\u2019ve been taught a certain kind of management that six years later with the internet would\u2019ve gotten blown up. So, for me, I always ask the why question. You were mentioning the book publishing or a bar. I just look at some things and go, \u201cWhy is that? Why does it work that way?\u201d Oftentimes, the people most entrenched in a system have no idea why. They\u2019re like the third or fourth generation of person within that system and they have no idea why a school bell rings in the morning, for example. Or why a bartender is washing the dishes. Often, I don\u2019t know the real answer, but I come up with alternative ones at least that suit my narrative, I guess.  Tim Ferriss: Undervalued skill, by the way, in some cases. You\u2019ve got to be careful. But very, very, very interesting. I want to pause here, partially because I\u2019m over-caffeinated. I was inspired by my nostalgia related to your double espressos. But why did the professor pull you aside? What did that early undergrad professor in Logic 101 see in you \u2013 whether he explained it or not later, I don\u2019t know \u2013 that led him to take a special interest in you?  Nick Kokonas: Well, I think I was prepared in earnest because I was mostly terrified. He had a reputation of being a \u2013 he was a Socratic method teacher. He was pretty harsh. Colgate was very small classes. There was a class of 80 people, and he wanted to whittle it down to a more manageable number. His method to do that was just to kick your ass. I remember \u2013 he probably, as great as he was, I doubt he would survive starting out at a college campus now. I literally saw him light fire to someone\u2019s notebook once when he was asking people examples of how to put out a fire. This one guy was just stuttering because he was so in fear, so he just lit his notebook on fire. And he stamped. The kid threw it on the ground and stamped on it. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to smother it! Sure!\u201d And he called everyone \u2013 he memorized every person\u2019s last name. It was Mr. and Ms.  I remember the specific day, he was literally back to the \u2013 this was like right out of a movie \u2013 he had his back to the class writing on a chalkboard some logic problem, symbolic logic. The guy next to me had no shot at getting it, none. So, he said his name and I wrote on the paper on my desk so he could see it, what the answer was. Then without missing a beat or turning around, he was like, \u201cMr. Kokonas, please do not help him. There is no way in hell he could possibly have done that without your help.\u201d This is like two or three weeks in. He spun around and he saw that I didn\u2019t have my book. He said, \u201cMr. Kokonas, where\u2019s your book?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s in my dorm room, Professor.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, a lot of good it\u2019s doing you there.\u201d I said, \u201cOn the contrary, it must apparently be doing me a lot of good there.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you after class.\u201d  I thought I was getting kicked out. There was a line forming to create office hours or to ask to be transferred out or whatever. When I got to the front, he said, \u201cFollow me,\u201d and I followed him to his office. I swear, he\u2019s running through the New England fall. I thought I was going to get kicked out of the class. When I closed the door, I turned around and he had his feet up on the desk. He said, \u201cWhere are you from? What do you want to do here?\u201d That was it. He took me under his wing. I was very fortunate. I never knew \u2013 here\u2019s the amazing part. I never knew the guy liked me until 10 years after I graduated. Then I was treated like a member of his family at his funeral 30 years later. A really fascinating person. A really fascinating moment in my life, where I don\u2019t know, someone saw something in me and went like, \u201cI\u2019m going to make an investment in this person.\u201d He never asked for anything back, ever.  Tim Ferriss: How did you not know that he liked you? Did he withhold in some way so that you wouldn\u2019t get a big head or something along those lines? Did he not want to get overly attached to you so he wouldn\u2019t express it? Nick Kokonas: No, no. I think I was 19 years old and I didn\u2019t know that the people who like you hold to a higher standard probably. Consequently, it was really, he beat the shit out of me in a good way. You know what I mean? It\u2019s like if you have someone who\u2019s teaching you something and they invest their team in you, and they think you have a chance of being good, they work you harder than the folks around you. So the people that I thought he liked, he was just being nice to because he didn\u2019t think they had a chance.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he didn\u2019t care; he wasn\u2019t invested.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah. With me, I think, he would be talking to my English professor without me even knowing and being like, \u201cThat paper sucks. He can do a lot better than that. Give him a C on that one.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d All of a sudden, that class got hard. I didn\u2019t know. I had no idea. It was an interesting, lucky, fortunate place to be at that time.  Tim Ferriss: We\u2019re going to get back to the Merc, but before we do, philosophy \u2013 I\u2019m endlessly fascinated by philosophy, but I\u2019m also a nerd and academic and pedantic and have spent a lot of time in school. For people who are listening to this who are already in their careers, or maybe they\u2019re in their early 20s, thinking of starting a company, but are entrepreneurially either involved or inclined, would you suggest if they don\u2019t have any exposure to philosophy that they read any particular books or resources or explore it in any way? Or would you say \u201cActually, you know what? That was an intermediate step to something else. You would probably be better off studying X, Y, and Z.\u201d Is there like a starter kit or something you would recommend to folks who don\u2019t have the philosophy exposure?  Nick Kokonas: I think part of it is if you read a book in isolation, it\u2019s not as rich of an experience as discussing those ideas within that context. That said, if you\u2019re the kind of person that loves to read and explore ideas, there\u2019s hardly a better place. It\u2019s a matter of finding what you enjoy. I happen to love The Problems of Philosophy, which Bertrand Russell wrote. It\u2019s sort of about Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas, but before Wittgenstein published. It\u2019s written in plain language. It\u2019s not hard to understand. Certainly Nietzsche is more like philosophy with some weird sugar coating of something on top of it. Man, as a young male, reading Nietzsche for the first time, I was like, fuck yeah. You know? It\u2019s not passive. I think people think of philosophers as Zen monks sitting there quietly contemplating the universe.  I think what it is, is people grappling with all the same questions and curiosity that we all have if you pause to think about it. It\u2019s so big that it\u2019s not just Descartes, \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d It\u2019s every little bit of that. Read Lucretius. He read the atomic \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Could you spell that? I\u2019m going to be the first one to admit that I \u2013 Nick Kokonas: Lucretius? Tim Ferriss: Oh, Lucretius. Nick Kokonas: Yeah, Lucretius.  Tim Ferriss: L-U-C-R-E-T-I-U-S. Nick Kokonas: Yeah, I\u2019m a terrible speller. Never ask me to spell anything.  Tim Ferriss: We\u2019ll put it in the show notes. Nick Kokonas: Read that. Or read this great book called The Swerve, which is about this monk ages ago that found that book and then rewrote it and saved it for history. It reads like a murder mystery. You don\u2019t necessarily need to start with philosophy. You can start with the things around it. I continue to find the world of ideas endlessly inspirational. Then, by the way, steal them and use them in whatever you\u2019re doing. They\u2019re there for you.  Tim Ferriss: Lucretius. L-U-C-R-E-T-I-U-S. Titus Lucretius Carus was a Roman poet and philosopher. We\u2019ll put that in the show notes. Bertrand Russell, also. I haven\u2019t read Bertrand Russell in so many ages, but it is very digestible. It is not dressed up in $10 words when $0.10 words would suffice. A lot of his writing is really powerful. I also just wanted to mention for folks, and I just thought about this, ages and ages ago I felt like I had certain gaps in my education after college. I ended up \u2013 I don\u2019t know why this didn\u2019t occur to me earlier, but someone mentioned that Stanford, UC Berkeley, these top-tier universities, all had extended or adult education classes taught by professors and junior professors. This is the same team who is teaching. Those are very readily accessible. Nick Kokonas: Even MIT OpenCourseWare. So many colleges now have taken that model and put great, great, great classes online. I know that every now and then I\u2019m surprised at what I find on there, and get sucked into. Like an all-nighter of taking some college class that I know nothing about, and it\u2019s so far over my head. But it kind of refuels you again to go like, oh, there are huge gaps where I know nothing. The older you get, the harder it is to start into something new, I find at least. It feels like the mountain it too big. Tim Ferriss: I would actually \u2013 not to pull a Nick \u2013 Nick Kokonas: Yeah, you disagree. That\u2019s great. Tim Ferriss: On the contrary, sir. My book is doing me a lot of good in my dorm room. Nick Kokonas: That\u2019s right. Tim Ferriss: I think one of your superpowers is that you ask the fundamental why questions about long-standing assumptions or conventional wisdom in different fields. The more you have done that, the more obvious it is to you to do it as a starting point, in a way. Let\u2019s go back to the Merc. We can go in any direction, of course. You step into this Lord of the Flies/gladiatorial arena with butchers and Ph.D.s and so on. Then what? Is there a point when you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, I actually do think I could be good at this?\u201d Nick Kokonas: No. For real, no. I was down there and I had made a fatal error of leaving school. Everyone told me it was a fatal error.  Tim Ferriss: This is the law school? Nick Kokonas: Yeah. I remember being down there and what I was doing was so brainless. It was literally you take this piece of paper over to that guy, and then that guy would yell at you, and rip the paper out of your hand, and then you\u2019d go get another one. It was literally that brain-dead. I was desperately looking to learn what was going on around me. Of course, I bought books on finance and commodities and options and all that. They were completely ridiculous and opaque and academic. It looked like they had no relationship to what was going on there at all. I started taking classes that were run at the Merc on mock trading, and just learning the hand signals and things like that, which were fine but didn\u2019t really teach you how to trade.  I spent time interviewing with big companies like Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and whatnot, because I did have the academic background where I would get the interview, I\u2019d be able to take the test, I\u2019d do well on their math and psychology tests. I would get offered a job as a trader, and then I would look at the contract. This is a key thing. People get out of college, they get offered a job. I think I\u2019m the only one who ever read the employment contract. What it said in there was basically they could do anything they want with me for three years. I don\u2019t even necessarily need to be a trader. That\u2019s what I was interested in doing. But they could ship me to France and have me do something totally different. I could be an analyst or God knows what.  When I would question that, they\u2019d be like, \u201cMan, you should be really happy. We had 300 applicants for this and we offered eight positions. Just take it.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Totally your style. Nick Kokonas: I know. I was kind of like, I grew up, I\u2019d be remiss not to say that my dad modeled \u2013 my dad was an entrepreneur by necessity because his dad died when he was really young. He fought both at the end of World War II, he was drafted into the Navy at the end of World War II. Was dismissed honorably after 16-18 months because they were downsizing the Navy. Then he was barely young enough to be drafted into the Army for the Korean War. When he got out, he had no usable skills. So he went to work at the grocery store that he started working at when he was 12 years old. He saved up all of his money from the Army and the Navy, and bought the store.  As I was growing up, my hero was my dad, who was not an academic; who was not what people would think of as an executive in a suit or whatever. But he did really well. He bought property and real estate. He owned a temporary labor office that supplied unskilled laborers to factories and conventions and whatnot. That was a really good business. He had a lot of common-sense smarts. He was horrified that I didn\u2019t go to law school. But meanwhile, I was modeling what he did. When I got down there, I was like, \u201cYou have to own your own situation.\u201d So when I was offered those jobs, I was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really see myself working for someone else.\u201d  I found a guy who also felt that way. He was working for a big company. They didn\u2019t want to make him a trader because he was too much of a quant. He was really well educated; he was really mathematical. He wanted to prove them wrong, so he took a small amount of money and started trading currency options. When I found him, I instantly knew that this was the right person, because I had talked to dozens of people and no one was like him. Then he said he didn\u2019t want to hire me. He didn\u2019t want to hire anyone.  Tim Ferriss: How did you meet him? Do you remember how you guys met?  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, I was just introduced to him through, back then, if you were a trader or a trading company, you have a clearing firm like Goldman Sachs. At the time, there was a company called First Options. He cleared First Options. Back then, you literally would have to take the elevator up to key punch in all the cards into a computer that was up 17 floors away. Ancient times. I met him through being introduced to him there. After talking to him, I knew he was the sort of geeky intellectual that I needed. Then when he told me that he didn\u2019t want to hire me because he hired some clerk, I was like, \u201cNo, no, no. I will pay you to work for you.\u201d He was like, \u201cThis is really strange.\u201d  I explained to him like, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been here for six months.\u201d I set a goal for myself of getting on a badge, it was called. Leasing a seat, and actually trading within a year. I was like, \u201cI need to get going on this. I need someone that\u2019s going to teach me options.\u201d It\u2019s fascinating because he then hired me for, I want to say it was $400 a week or something like that. I stood right next to him all day every day. He taught me options theory from scratch. Better than any college ever could. To the point where you\u2019re looking three derivatives in, it\u2019s not just volatility curve, but the curve of the curve. As soon as I started grasping this and going deeper down that rabbit hole, the more I liked it as a puzzle.  Certainly the money had an appeal, but it was also, \u201cHey, here\u2019s this giant competition. It\u2019s like playing a huge, multifaceted chess game that no one\u2019s going to get exactly right.\u201d But like I said earlier, it\u2019s about making hundreds of decisions a day. Even when you get 10 in a row that come up tails, you know that the next one is 50/50. That discipline was interesting. That was more about teaching yourself the psychology of standing there while everyone told you that you were wrong, or you were physically small, or you were too educated, or too serious. You can\u2019t imagine how much of a fraternity house that place was. Everything in Wolf of Wall Street, I have seen. I haven\u2019t lived, but I\u2019ve seen it all.  I started hiring very shortly after I started trading. About a year later, I left and started my own company with almost nothing. I hired my first employee, who became my business partner for the last 25 years. I taught him what I\u2019d learned. I hired people that I considered corporate refugees. People who worked for companies and decided that independence was better.  Tim Ferriss: Why did you leave after a year?  Nick Kokonas: He was moving over to the Chicago Board of Trade, and I had found a couple of awesome programmers to help build this options analysis software. He offered me up to run some of the operations at the Mercantile Exchange when he went over to trade the bonds at the Board of Trade. He was a really smart guy. He made me a deal that when you analyzed it very carefully, got worse over time. I just went, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s been great and I\u2019ve learned a ton. We\u2019ve made each other a bunch of money. It\u2019s a win/win.\u201d But I really wanted to do my own thing. I wanted to be the captain of my own ship, I guess. Thankfully, this guy Jim Hanson, who is still one of my dearest friends, had an option to stay with that company or come with a completely underfunded company.  Thinking back, it was so stupid from a risk perspective. It was asymmetric. Far more upside than downside. It worked out really well. We spent most of our time as we hired people and taught them how to do this, it was mostly psychology training. It was mostly standing around after hours and saying, what\u2019s 7 x 28? And screaming it at each other like a drill sergeant until the person couldn\u2019t remember what 9 x 3 was anymore.  Tim Ferriss: Wait. Why did you do that? Nick Kokonas: Well, you had to be quick on basic mental agility. So, if you bought 450 contracts and it was a 20 Delta, you needed to be able to do, what\u2019s 20 percent of 450? It\u2019s 90. But you need to do that precisely with numbers that are not so round. You need to be willing to not be perfect, and you need to make that decision instantaneously, and realizing that it could cost you $50,000 to $100,000 if you get it right or wrong. You have to be really comfortable with that. What did we do? Well, we stood around and we turned people\u2019s brains into mush. I literally had people punch me, cry, run out. It sounds awful, but it\u2019s amazing training, because the rest of the world moves much slower. So, any other decisions that I\u2019ve made in business since then have felt glacial in pace.  Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s also something to be said for making the training in some or all respects harder than the competition, right? The adage of the more you sweat during peacetime, the less you bleed during wartime. The best competitors I\u2019ve met in many fields often strive to make their training and the toil of their preparation harder than what they expect to face when they actually \u2013 Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s why we like watching big-time sports. When it matters, there are certain people that you know \u2013 you can almost look at them and go, \u201cThat poor person is going to fade.\u201d Then you hope they don\u2019t. You hope all that training pays off. I love golf for all the same reasons. It\u2019s just a series of constant failures. Then when you look at someone who can pull that rabbit out of the hat at exactly the right moment, it\u2019s pretty wonderful to see. The thing I loved about my time down there, even though I burned out of it after 10 years, is that there were moments where I did \u2013 I have friends who will listen to this and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh, yeah, I remember that time in the SOP pit! You really got this right.\u201d But I made some completely stupid decisions. But mostly on the measure, when things go crazy, I was able to perform more than that.  I remember Greenspan\u2019s \u201cIrrational Exuberance\u201d speech was like a formative moment where I went, \u201cWow, I can not only hang in this environment, I can thrive in it.\u201d You get home soaking wet with sweat. It was a physical job. It was really blue-collar in a lot of ways. I got home that day and I was like, \u201cThat was what I prepped my last six years for.\u201d It was very satisfying. It sounds like an awful \u2013 it is an awful thing in a way. It\u2019s just about pure commerce. It serves a purpose of price discovery and all that, but any individual person isn\u2019t really the one doing that. I think that there are negatives to the whole system as well, in hindsight. But man, at the time, it just felt like great mental training.  Tim Ferriss: What would you recommend to people who are listening and are having this flashback to the introductory text exchange about beating the market over a long period of time, who are hoping to become better investors? You can take that anywhere you want. But are there any particular tools, books, mental models, anything that you\u2019d recommend? Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s really hard. I think the mental model is asymmetric risk. Always look for something that the upside is 3-4x the downside. Obviously, quantifying those is very difficult, but that\u2019s the key. Everything is try to do is asymmetric. Then, even though Nassim Taleb is a bit of a pedantic goofball on Twitter, his book Fooled by Randomness is awesome. That was the one that preceded Black Swan. I think Black Swan is great; it\u2019s fine. But Fooled by Randomness is, I think, the better of all his books because man, it just encapsulates everything. People price things incorrectly.  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a great book, yeah.  Nick Kokonas: All you have to do is walk through a casino and you see everybody pricing their outcomes incorrectly. The entire city is built on that. If you could get in your head \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Literally.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, literally. I don\u2019t take any pleasure. People are like, \u201cYou must love gambling,\u201d or whatever. It\u2019s like, I would never sit down to a blackjack table because I know that there\u2019s a 49.5 percent chance that I\u2019m going to win, and that\u2019s the wrong way.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Fooled by Randomness has come up a number of times. I haven\u2019t read it in ages, because it is one of his earlier books. Howard Marks also brought this up recently when I was chatting with him. It is an exceptional book I think for developing a new lens on life, not just investing. When you are investing for yourself now, how do you think about risk? Because this is a word that has popped up a few times. How do you personally think about risk in your life? For instance, some startup founders look at the risk as the various early-stage startups, restaurants, bars, and so on, that you\u2019re involved with, and then you play it safe in your other asset allocation? How do you think about risk in your life or in investing?  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, that\u2019s a pretty difficult question.  Tim Ferriss: It is, yeah. Nick Kokonas: I think that if you look at everything that I\u2019ve done business-wise, everybody would say that the failure rate is super high in what we do. So trading, they used to say, \u201cOne of a hundred people that goes down there breaks even their first year. Out of that one, take another hundred of those ones and less than one in a hundred of those becomes a millionaire.\u201d I went, \u201cGreat.\u201d It\u2019s like the old Jim Carrey. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a chance?\u201d Then you go to the restaurant business. People are like, \u201cOh, yeah, 95 percent of all restaurants go out of business in their first two years.\u201d I\u2019m going, like, \u201cGreat. That\u2019s perfect.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Why do you have that response? Nick Kokonas: Then I\u2019m doing a software startup now, too.  Tim Ferriss: Go for it. Nick Kokonas: So, the higher, the smaller the hoop, the more interesting it is to figure it out. And once you\u2019re up there and you know how to jump up through that little hoop, there\u2019s fewer people playing that game. The other thing is, I remember right when I was going to start building Alinea with Grant, I was talking to a restaurant owner. By all accounts, he was pretty successful. He had four to five restaurants. One of them I really liked a lot, and we\u2019d go there a lot. I got to know him a little bit. He said, \u201cSo what are you up to?\u201d I said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m building a restaurant now.\u201d He looked at me and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible business. You don\u2019t want to do it. Incredible failure rate; terrible.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhy did you build the next four?\u201d  Tim Ferriss: How did he respond to that? Nick Kokonas: You know, no one does. We\u2019ll get to it, I\u2019m sure, but that\u2019s the way I was with the publishing thing. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey man, people keep printing books, and yet I can\u2019t figure out any of the information. And yet they\u2019re going to give me $300,000 or $400,000 to write a book. Something is remiss here.\u201d You know what I mean? I\u2019ve never written a book before, but yet someone is going to write me a $400,000 check. There must be a lot of money on the other side of that bet. And so, consequently, I always try to look for the high, small hoops. Then I spend my time learning as much as I can, and then I jump through that hoop. It\u2019s both more interesting, I think, and I also think getting back to the asymmetry of risk, those are the ones that yeah, you might have a \u2013 well, first of all, do you really have a 95 percent failure rate if you put in all that effort? I don\u2019t think so.  Second of all, I think they priced it wrong, so to speak. Then second of all, man, that\u2019s where the fun is. That gets you up in the morning and going to work. Tim Ferriss: This is where, among many other places, averages can be very misleading. I always end up in public Q&As and things of this type hearing various numbers and stats thrown around, many of which I think have no basis on any data whatsoever. There is, \u201cWe only use 10 percent of our brains.\u201d Not true. There is the \u201cNine out of 10 startups fail within the first year,\u201d or whatever the stat is. The first question that occurs to me with a number like the latter, or I guess a ratio is, \u201cIs it because the model is difficult?\u201d Is it because startups are inherently that high risk, or are there other plausible explanations? Is it that nine out of 10 people who attempt to start a startup don\u2019t do any of the necessary due diligence?  Nick Kokonas: I\u2019ve been on a couple of graduate school, entrepreneurship contests and whatnot. One of the things that always happens there is what I call the time machine. Somebody comes up with a business plan that is like, \u201cI\u2019m going to build a time machine.\u201d Now of course, it\u2019s not really a time machine. But I have seen ones that defy the laws of physics, for example. Or new pipeline technology, but they have no idea. It\u2019s just a pipe dream. They\u2019ve done none of the engineering. So you look at that and you go, \u201cYou haven\u2019t really done the homework yet, at all.\u201d Then there\u2019s a lot of people who come to me and they\u2019ve spent six months doing their logo and the name of the company, but they don\u2019t actually have a piece of software yet. \u201cOh, I\u2019m just going to hire someone to build that for me.\u201d Or an app. I get so many apps pitched to me. They don\u2019t know how to build an app, but they\u2019ve got a logo and an idea. I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s a good way to blow a half million dollars on a consultant.\u201d You must get that 50 times worse than I do.  Tim Ferriss: What I tend to get, and this is part of the reason why I stopped all the startup stuff a couple years ago, is it got to the point where 90 percent of the pitches I received \u2013 which were unsolicited \u2013 would be along the lines of \u201cHi,\u201d like not even a first name. Or it would be like, \u201cHi, Tim,\u201d or, \u201cHey, Tim!\u201d Even better. \u201cI\u2019m the CEO or co-founder of X. We are raising this at this valuation. We are oversubscribed, but we could squeeze you in for 25k if you\u2019re really interested because we admire ABC. Here are the docs attached. Let us know if you\u2019re interested in the next 60 minutes.\u201d Which my default response to anything like that, where people are pressuring me for a fast decision, is \u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019ve lost very little money saying no to those things.  Coming back to the examples that you were giving and what we were talking about, bridging over to restaurants and food. So you\u2019re being told how restaurants are an awful business; food is an awful business. I remember someone told me a long, long time ago, \u201cIf you want to lose money, go into magazines or restaurants.\u201d At what point \u2013 and I have a little bit of the backstory, but not all the details \u2013 at what point do you decide to go into or get involved with restaurants, and why?  Nick Kokonas: I left trading in about 2002. 2001 was a tough year between 9/11, which my father had died in February of that year. I was burnt out after going really hard for so long. We\u2019d built up a pretty good size company. I\u2019d merged with a firm in New York. I needed a break, but didn\u2019t know how to really take one at the time. So I left trading. I immediately panicked, because here was something I really, genuinely enjoyed. But I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do next. I started doing consulting for a small hedge fund. Then I just didn\u2019t know what to do. I had an awesome wife and a young son, and things were good. But I was panicked. I was playing golf with ex-athletes, because who else is 34 years old and can play golf on a Wednesday afternoon? It was just a weird thing. I looked at them and they didn\u2019t seem all that happy, even though they\u2019ve got this lifestyle.  I met Grant Achatz, the chef, while dining at Trio. I went to a lunch there afternoon that some friends set up. It was a transformative experience. It was artistic. It was intellectual. It was thought-provoking. Most of all, it was emotional. Those are all things that I would never have associated with eating a dinner. From a perspective of great art experiences, like seeing a great movie or a great play, or going to an amazing museum opening, we kept getting drawn back there. We kept going back. We would go back so frequently that it was absurd. Because it was a big meal and it wasn\u2019t cheap. Every time we\u2019d go somewhere else, we\u2019d go like, \u201cWow, why is no one else thinking this way?\u201d  As I got to know Grant a little bit, I think sometimes people bring the chef some wine or beer or whatever. That\u2019s kind of sand to the beach. I would bring him books. I didn\u2019t figure he had a lot of time to read. I would put a Post-it note on a page of an old book. I remember I brought him this book called The Peregrinations of an Epicure. Tim Ferriss: Hold on a second. The Peregrinations \u2013 like a Peregrine falcon? I don\u2019t even know what that is.  Nick Kokonas: No, no, a peregrination is like a wondering about. So, it was written just after World War II by an ex-serviceman. He goes around Paris, I want to say maybe late \u201840s, early \u201850s. I can\u2019t recall exactly. There is a chapter in there on La Pyramide, the best in the world at the time. He described a meal there in emotional terms that resonated with what Grant was doing, even though his technique, his cuisine, everything was completely different. I would literally highlight a couple lines in there and give him this book, which was out of print at the time. We developed this email relationship back and forth, where he would try out some new food on us, and I would give direct, honest feedback. But not, \u201cOh, it was delicious!\u201d It was more like, \u201cYou\u2019re going for a provocation there.\u201d We would go back and forth.  He wrote at the time on a forum called eGullet. I went on there and his spelling and grammar notwithstanding, it was like reading someone who\u2019s really thinking hard about what they\u2019re doing. Everything we just talked about, here was this young, 28-year-old chef from Michigan who looked like Captain America. He was like Hollywood in the sense that he was good-looking and very driven, very clean-cut. But he didn\u2019t look like the stereotype, central casting of a chef, chubby gregarious guy. He was really quiet and introspective, shy. But then you read these, which are still up. You can still Google it. He\u2019d go on for like four pages about bread service. Like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of bread?\u201d This is a guy that I could wrap my head around.  I remember on January 20, 2004, my wife\u2019s birthday. She said, \u201cYeah, I want to go back there.\u201d We\u2019d never been in the kitchen before. They have a table in there, but we\u2019d never eaten in there. I remember I emailed him and said, \u201cShe\u2019s ethnically Latvian, speaks Japanese, and loves Thai food. Good fucking luck.\u201d I knew exactly what that would do to him. That would put him into 10 days of pure hell, because he would research Latvian food. He would redo a whole menu. 20 courses, right? I didn\u2019t know they were going to put us in the kitchen. They put us in the kitchen. It sounds like a jerky thing to do now, but we did have a relationship a little bit at the time.  He served us the most amazing meal of my life. It started out with Latvian sorrel soup with braised ham hocks. It had flavors of the sea, which was a Japanese dish. It had Thai dishes, but it was all in his style. So, it was his own, and yet it had elements of all these things. At the end of that meal, he said to me, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I had watched the kitchen. It was like a watchmaker\u2019s shop. It was not screaming and yelling.  Tim Ferriss: Sorry to interrupt. It is so unlike anything that the vast majority of people listening to this would possibly expect, right?  Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s not Gordon Ramsay. Tim Ferriss: It is complete silence. It is like a watchmaking factory. It is really something else. Anyway, sorry to jump in.  Nick Kokonas: No, no, that\u2019s totally fine. At the end, I said, \u201cI doubt anybody anywhere in the world had a better meal tonight.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, thank you.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat do you plan on doing with yourself?\u201d I\u2019d had a lot of wine. I looked at him; he sat down with us. I said, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not going to be here forever.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I want to build my own restaurant.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help you do that.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, what kind of restaurant do you want to build?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never built a restaurant before.\u201d That was it. Then like a week later, I got an email with his business plan. I invited him by my house. And a year to the day later of that, that was May 4th. We went back and forth on email. On May 4th, we held a dinner at my house for potential investors. On May 4, 2005, we opened Alinea.  Tim Ferriss: That is nuts. In terms of \u2013 Nick Kokonas: Completely nuts. We didn\u2019t even know each other.  Tim Ferriss: I mean, can you put that in perspective for people? I actually did not realize that was the timeframe.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah.  Tim Ferriss: Can you, just in the context of normal restaurant world? Nick Kokonas: We argued. We didn\u2019t really know each other very well, but he would come by my house and he didn\u2019t \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Let me interject for a second, because you\u2019ve said \u201cWe didn\u2019t know each other very well.\u201d What did you know about each other, nonetheless, that gave you guys the push, the impulse, and the sufficient level of trust/excitement to actually pursue it? There had to be something there. It couldn\u2019t just be nothing. So what was it? You didn\u2019t know each other well. I mean, maybe you didn\u2019t know the full scope of each other\u2019s backgrounds.  Nick Kokonas: I actually studied that. That I actually knew. I knew the facts. I knew what he was putting in front of me. But I didn\u2019t know him the way you\u2019d know someone that you were going to become a business partner with. I think he just thought I was rich. I\u2019m being serious. Like I think everyone else wanted \u2013 this is really true because he has said this to me. Everyone else wanted to offer him a restaurant that they had already built or wanted to build. I actually answered that question correctly. The \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is an awesome thing to say 90 percent of the time of your life. When he said, \u201cWhat kind of restaurant do you want to build,\u201d I could have waxed on about some dream I had or just made some bullshit up at the time, but I just said, \u201cI have no idea. That\u2019s a big question. We need to sort that out.\u201d  I think that was the right answer for him. I think that\u2019s all he needed to know was, \u201cOkay, the guy\u2019s got an open mind. He seems to have done well in business. He knows apparently how to build something.\u201d What was really funny was the stuff that I was concerned about, which was like architecture, design, plumbing, building, lease, all of that, he was like, the word \u201coblivious\u201d is not too strong a word. \u00a0This is not a criticism of him either, right? It\u2019s just like he came to my house and was like, \u201cYeah, I want Martin to design everything.\u201d Martin Kastner, who is a genius designer, has Crucial Detail, which we\u2019ve been involved with for 15 years now. He\u2019s a designer. He\u2019s an artisan. He built plateware and he won the Bocuse d\u2019Or for the platter he designed from Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud\u2019s team for Team USA and all that. But back then, this guy\u2019s not going to design plumbing or electrical.  I would just look at this guy and go, \u201cNo, he can\u2019t. We need an architect and you need to get city stamps and all that.\u201d I think Grant was just like, \u201cYeah, you find a place, you put tables in it, you build a kitchen, and you go.\u201d In terms of \u2013 obviously he knew there were health inspectors and all that. But the process of all this just about \u2013 either we\u2019re not going to build it ever eight weeks in because we would\u2019ve hated each other, or we were the kind of people that figured everything out. We just talked it out. Right down to what kind of tables. What kind of glassware. What kind of this. We wanted to rethink the why again of everything. \u201cWhy do you put a candle on a table? Why is a candle romantic?\u201d That\u2019s a question we asked. \u201cWhy do we need candles? Why is that romantic? Why do people put a little bud vase on the table? Why shouldn\u2019t that be an edible thing? That\u2019d be cool.\u201d  So, we did all of that. We designed the experience to create emotional responses from the moment that you walked in the front door. We didn\u2019t have the podium. We went, \u201cWhat does a good greeting feel like?\u201d Not just \u201cIf you\u2019re at someone\u2019s house, what does that feel like? If you\u2019re at a restaurant, what shouldn\u2019t it feel like?\u201d Well, it shouldn\u2019t feel like a computer in front of your face saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d and all of that. We went through every aspect of that. I lost almost 20 pounds that year. Not in a healthy way. Just GCing the construction. I laid tile in the basement like three days before we opened. Tim Ferriss: Let me pause for one second. So the why question that comes to mind for me is, after the finance, after battling it out on the front lines and going through 2001, why this as your next thing? Why is this the thing that captured your imagination? You had to know on some level, once you started getting into the details, like, \u201cFuck, this is going to be\u201d \u2013 Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s all in, yeah.  Tim Ferriss: \u201cThis is going to be all my chips, energetically.\u201d So why this? Nick Kokonas: You know, there are occasional times when you wake up in the morning and that thought comes back to you. That like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m really sucked into this.\u201d For about three or four months, without telling anybody, even Dagmara, not telling her, telling no one, I kept going, \u201cI should build a restaurant with this guy. Like, it would be the best restaurant in the world if it was done all the way.\u201d I recognized my inner voice saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a really dumb idea. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d I\u2019d never worked a day in my life in a restaurant. I also recognized, and this is also critical, I recognized that so many people built their living room after they made some money. They went, \u201cOh, I know how to host a good dinner party. I know good wine, so I\u2019m going to build me a restaurant.\u201d Then they sit there like it\u2019s their living room. That\u2019s not good.  I didn\u2019t want to be that deucy guy that built a restaurant because my ego needed to host a party. Whenever I would later on broach that subject and people would say, \u201cwell\u2026\u201d and I could almost hear their brain whispering, \u201cWell, of course that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d That was, again, not the best of motivations in the world, perhaps, but the honest one. That was hugely motivating eventually. When we first started, it was this nagging thing like I\u2019d wake up in the morning and I\u2019d go, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not really into what I\u2019m doing right now. I\u2019ve just met somebody who\u2019s the best in the world at what they do, and no one knows it yet.\u201d That\u2019s probably happened to me \u2013 I\u2019m really fortunate, but that\u2019s probably happened to me seven or eight times in my life.  When it happens and I meet that person, whoever it might be, no matter what they\u2019re doing, I pause. I kind of acknowledge that directly. Then I just go like, \u201cCan we grab a glass of wine or coffee or something?\u201d That\u2019s something worth marking and going, \u201cWow, this person\u2019s really invested in something.\u201d Grant had every aspect of being that at 28 years old. In hindsight, it looks smart, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, it was years before it felt smart.  Tim Ferriss: You mentioned just now that you\u2019ve met these people seven or eight times who are the best in the world or potentially the best in the world. Nick Kokonas: Well, among them, yeah.  Tim Ferriss: Among them. But the key point that jumps out for me is: \u201c\u2026and the world didn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d So my question for you is, that sort of brings to the forefront in my mind at least, the question of, \u201cWhat is Nick seeing or feeling that other people are not?\u201d Could you talk to that? Is there a feeling or a particular type of observation, a particular type of detail that you notice in these people that allows you to scout the talent where other people might miss it or not pay enough attention to it?  Nick Kokonas: I think you\u2019ve written a couple books about that. It\u2019s definitely intangible. I think it\u2019s different in every case. It\u2019s interesting because you can tell when someone is fully committed, I guess, to their craft, or their art, or their business, or whatever it is that they\u2019re doing, their sport. It\u2019s not be they talk about it all the time, although if you push a little, they\u2019re happy to do so. But it\u2019s more like if you look around, the vast majority of people are not fully committed to whatever, you know? I think part of what you do is you try to steer people to find those things that they can commit to. Or you can try to lower a barrier to show them the commitment is not as hard as you think in this particular area, right? Tim Ferriss: Right. Nick Kokonas: But these folks are all in. They\u2019re 99 percent in. That\u2019s what they do. Often to the detriment, frankly, of other aspects of their lives. I guess you get better at noticing them. Now I live for that. I love meeting people that even if it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in, that are all in. That\u2019s an interesting \u2013 really, I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way. It was just very clear to me that Grant was all in. Here\u2019s the thing. If he wasn\u2019t going to do it with me, he was still going to do it. I was a helper. Over time, I certainly contributed a great deal to it. He contributed a great deal to the business, and I also contributed to the art, but that took time. But I could tell that he was all in. That was fun. It\u2019s fun to work with somebody who is basically like, \u201cOkay, man, if you\u2019re not in, get out of the way, because I\u2019m still going.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: For anyone who has the opportunity, I don\u2019t even know if they would have the opportunity, but to watch, observe Grant for even 60 seconds.  Nick Kokonas: Well, Chef\u2019s Table on Netflix is great.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Chef\u2019s Table. Great, perfect. Everybody should have the experience of observing Grant working and focusing. I\u2019ve met a lot of people who are good at focusing who have abnormal focusing abilities. Spending the time that we did together in Chicago, and the time that I had to observe Grant, it is a next level of focus. It\u2019s really hard to encapsulate in words. So, Chef\u2019s Table, fantastic. People should check it out, and just watch the level of focus that permeates the appearance, the air, the atmosphere. It\u2019s really something else. To that point, focus. One of my favorite aspects of speaking with you and having conversations is the questions that you raised. Candles. Not just, \u201cShould we have candles?\u201d That\u2019s maybe a good question, but it\u2019s probably not the right first question. Why do restaurants use candles in the first place? Furthermore, why are candles considered romantic? Stepping back.  Nick Kokonas: Basic stuff, yeah. Tim Ferriss: What are other questions that you asked related to Alinea? Or you could certainly bridge to other, I think it makes sense to chat about Aviary as well. But what are some other questions that you guys asked that people might not think to ask?  Nick Kokonas: Grant set the tone for that in our first meeting, not really knowing me. We started talking. We didn\u2019t even know where to start, right? He said, \u201cWell, I know one thing. I want to have wooden tables. I want to have bare wood tables.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cWell why do fancy restaurants have white tablecloths? They literally call it a white tablecloth restaurant if it\u2019s fancy. Why?\u201d I couldn\u2019t really \u2013 I came up with dumb answers. \u201cIt feels good. It absorbs a spill,\u201d or whatever it may be. He said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s because the table underneath is a piece of shit.\u201d He goes, \u201cAnd you know that. As soon as you say it, everyone goes, \u2018Oh, yeah, I knew that.\u2019 You\u2019ve been at weddings and stuff where you feel under the table and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s plywood.\u2019 But if you go to a really fancy restaurant and you feel under the table, guess what? Also plywood, just a little thicker.\u201d  He\u2019s like, \u201cWhen you rest your arms on the table, even if it doesn\u2019t come forefront in your mind, you subconsciously know that they\u2019re fooling you.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have black, beautiful tables? It\u2019ll show the food great. It\u2019ll show the plateware great.\u201d Then I went like, \u201cWell, yeah, but the health department in Chicago doesn\u2019t let you put silverware right on the table.\u201d If you put a glass there, the condensation will form a little ring, and then you have a wear issue. But you\u2019ll save $70,000 a year in laundering linens. We started going, \u201cWell how do we solve the water problem? Well, you create a fridge that\u2019s just above the dew point, 44 degrees in the winter, maybe a little warmer in the summer because it\u2019s higher humidity in Chicago, and you just get rid of ice.\u201d  You have these cascading decisions that become part of the art of the place. Some of them start from a really practical thing like, \u201cHey, we want to have a quality table.\u201d Then all of a sudden you need a little pillow that the silverware goes on that Martin designed, because we didn\u2019t want to have placemats; that\u2019s too cheap. All of a sudden, we had to design a silverware holder. It just became this cascade of interesting little art projects that were there for good reasons, and really created a unique atmosphere. It was one of those things like we never tested until the day we opened. You couldn\u2019t test those things. The very first guy through the door is now a famous chef, Chef Sean Brock of Husk.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he\u2019s fantastic.  Nick Kokonas: He was not yet a chef then, 2005. He was the first guy through the door. He wrote this giant blog post on eGullet with pictures and everything. You can go see it. Every single thing that we hoped would create an emotional trigger, an emotional reaction, it\u2019s almost all there. I remember going home and seeing that the next day and going, \u201cWow. That shit actually worked!\u201d Right down to the front hallway that was a reverse perspective, stolen from Chartres Cathedral and inverted. All of my interest in architecture, and art, and science, and all of Grant\u2019s food, and all that, all came together in a year-long conversation on how to do something.  We really fought with the architect and designers and all that because people would tell us the practical reasons why you needed to do this or that. We would just go no, no host stand. We wanted to greet people in an open way. Just little things like that. Then we\u2019ve taken that on through everything that we\u2019ve done, where we took six or seven years to build our next place because we didn\u2019t have that idea that kept us up at night again. When we did, then we did it. I think editing yourself and each other in an open way is really painful, but really important.  Tim Ferriss: Coming back to something you mentioned related to the living room. The well-off, who then creates say an art project that is not \u2013 it may be beautiful, but is most often not a viable business. How did you apply those questions, and rethink the business model to make any of this work financially? Nick Kokonas: You don\u2019t want to be a dilettante, right? And so, my biggest fear is that it would work in an artistic way, but wouldn\u2019t work as a business. So, the answer is, at the beginning, I didn\u2019t do much. I handled all of our marketing and PR. I wrote everything myself. I really thought about open-sourcing the building of the restaurant. You can still go online and see the original business plans and logos we were considering using, and the test kitchen, which was in my house. We didn\u2019t tell anyone at the time, but that was my house at the time. And see the development of this restaurant.  I felt like the open-source movement in that way was a good model for what we were trying to accomplish. Part of that was people would say a restaurant like this can\u2019t make money. I wrote this little spreadsheet that I called the Universal Restaurant Calculator.  Tim Ferriss: Can people find that online? Nick Kokonas: No, no, no. It would be very unimpressive if they could. But it was basically how many covers per night \u2013 this is back-of-the-envelope stuff \u2013 how many covers per night can you do? What\u2019s the check average for food? Check average for beverage? What are your food costs, beverage costs, labor costs? What does insurance cost? Your lease, your rent? All those things. I had enough experience with most of those things to at least give good estimates to it. So what I started doing is I started modeling other restaurants using the Universal Restaurant Calculator. I had, again, this goes to the transparency of data. I had real data for only two restaurants. From those two, I would then make assumptions about restaurants like The French Laundry, where Grant used to work, one of the greatest restaurants in the history of America, certainly.  I came up with a number that Grant went, \u201cThere\u2019s no way their revenue is that high or they make that much money. That\u2019s impossible.\u201d It\u2019s really funny because years later, I now work with Chef Keller, and he\u2019s a friend all these years later. I literally pulled that out with Grant one day being there and went like, \u201cHow close am I back on this in 2005?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you were within 2 or 3 percent. Grant was just like \u2013 we\u2019re talking about back-of-the-envelope stuff. So you asked where can people start to start a business? Start on the back of an envelope. One of my favorite exercises is to sit in a restaurant or a small business of some sort and just literally do the back of the envelope.  It was the kind of the calculation my dad called the two-shoebox method; put me through college. Money coming in one shoebox, money going out in the other. Whatever\u2019s left is profit. Start that basic. We did that. I didn\u2019t really think about the \u2013 we did well, but we didn\u2019t make a ton of money. Alinea cost $2.2 million to build. I put up a little over a quarter of that myself and found investors for the rest, all of whom I knew. In the first year, we made about $450,000 to $500,000 on $4 or $5 million in sales. Not a great return. Not a terrible return. We then won Best Restaurant in America from Gourmet magazine. I was horrified that we won that, frankly.  I remember Grant called me and said, \u201cI just got a call from Ruth Reichl.\u201d We had some stated goals of how we would know if this was a success. One of the things we wrote down was, \u201cRuth Reichl declares it the best restaurant in America.\u201d We wrote that because in 1997, she wrote, \u201cThe most exciting place to eat in America is The French Laundry.\u201d Grant was there and cooked that meal and said that the energy of having someone he respected so much \u2014 because Ruth is just a great writer; she is one of the unimpeachable food critics in the history of America \u2014 having her write that in The New York Times propelled that restaurant to its permanent status. I think that can\u2019t happen nowadays, honestly, for other reasons. This was pre-internet, pre-Yelp, all that.  Then all of a sudden, we got that and I was horrified, because one of our goals was completed so early. We wouldn\u2019t have our lodestar. He was like, \u201cDear God, can you let me enjoy it for like a minute?\u201d  Tim Ferriss: To you? Nick Kokonas: Yeah, yeah. He was mad at me. I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible!\u201d I was happy. But I was also like, \u201cOh, no, now what do we do? We need to find another artificial construct here to go after.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Enough of this. I need to find happiness. Get this other happiness out of my face. Nick Kokonas: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, no. I really do believe that it\u2019s often the process is so rewarding that when you get something done, it can be a letdown. I wanted that process to go. Then, unfortunately, six months later, Grant was diagnosed with stage IV cancer and given six months to live. So weirdly, that was the moment that after he was going through treatment, where I started going into the restaurant at night. Because, remember, I\u2019m not a service professional. I was running the business of the restaurant. I would start going in at night and start asking really dumb questions again. Weirdly, our goal was to keep Alinea open for when he came back. Mind you, he only missed 12 days, 14 days of service during really intense chemo and radiation. But he was given six months to live.  When people are in that situation and their livelihood is tied to this restaurant, even despite their loyalties, oftentimes they just need to find another job. Because they\u2019re like, hey, in four months, this place is going to be closed. And in the midst of that, we decided to do our first book, really to chronicle what he had accomplished. Because for him, he felt like that would be his legacy. He thought he was going to die. He was told he was going to die. In the midst of creating a self-created, self-published book, and trying to do that differently, and then keeping a dwindling staff motivated, trying to let him know that it would still be there when he got well, all of that, I started going, \u201cThis place is run in strange ways, man. This industry is not run right.\u201d  I started asking basic questions. Like, \u201cIf we have a wait list for 100 people on a Wednesday, why do we do 74 people on a Wednesday, but 86 on a Saturday?\u201d And the answer was because our incentives were misaligned. The service industry as a whole can\u2019t run at 100% every single day of the week, unless they\u2019re incentivized to do so. You could go like, \u201cWell, yeah, every server there will make an extra $100 a night or whatever.\u201d But they\u2019re going, \u201cLook, if every night was Saturday, I\u2019d be dead. It\u2019s really hard work. You need to figure out ways of load-balancing that and making every day the same. You end up way ahead.\u201d So from a business perspective, that\u2019s when my sort of self-education in this industry came forward. It came forward in a way that I think I was less patient with everything because we were also going through this really difficult, emotional time.  Consequently, when I didn\u2019t get answers that made any sense, instead of being diplomatic about it, I would just be like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s stupid.\u201d Which cut some of the normal social filter off, and I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t a pleasant time to be around anybody. But I also think it was accepted within that environment at that time, because everyone knew what we were going through. And so, years later, when we finally were like, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got some ideas to build Next and the Aviary,\u201d that\u2019s when I went, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to do things totally differently here. Anyone who\u2019s not on board, even though they work for us, if you\u2019re not on board all the way in on getting rid of normal reservations and not using telephones and doing all these things, we don\u2019t have a place for you here.\u201d Man, it really worked.  That was the basis of \u2013 I talked to every software company in the industry asking for their APIs, asking to build essentially what\u2019s options pricing software on top of reservations systems. OpenTable told me no. The POS systems told me no. I called theaters and went, what ticketing system do you use? All of those told me no. I hired a single programmer, and he and I in six weeks built a really rudimentary booking system. But the first day we turned it on, we sold $562,000 of tickets to our restaurant for the first time ever.  Tim Ferriss: Okay, so pause here for a second.  Nick Kokonas: I know, we\u2019re way ahead. Tim Ferriss: No, no. This is great. A few things for folks who are not familiar. API \u2013 application programming interface \u2013 it\u2019s how you can effectively link into someone else\u2019s software. POS \u2013 point of sale, not piece of shit.  Nick Kokonas: Ah, but it is a piece of shit.  Tim Ferriss: It may also be a piece of shit. What were the design specs that you were looking for? In other words, before you get to the $500,000+ with a snap of the fingers, what were you trying to fix or what were you trying to create?  Nick Kokonas: I get a lot of grief for saying this in the industry and in the press. But basically, whenever you make a restaurant reservation, one of the two of you talking is lying to each other. If you think about it, no other form, no other industry form of entertainment, which dining out is a form of entertainment. I know it\u2019s sustenance. I know there\u2019s so much culture embedded in it and all that, but you could eat at home. No other form of entertainment you just call them up and say, \u201cHey, hold a seat to the Bears game or the Cubs game, or the opera, and I\u2019ll show up around 7:30.\u201d Then they tell you, \u201cYeah, yeah, we\u2019ll have a seat ready for you at 7:30.\u201d Then when you get there, they go, \u201cOh, you know what? Go wait over there for 30 or 40 minutes, because we\u2019re running a little behind tonight.\u201d  The reason that they\u2019re running behind is because they overbooked because about 15 to 18 percent of people don\u2019t show up. So, they overbook. They also know that if they tell you that they\u2019ll really seat you at 9:00 and you wanted an 8:15, you\u2019ll just go to the restaurant down the street from them that will lie to them, right? Tim Ferriss: Right. Nick Kokonas: So they do that and ultimately it\u2019s just bad all around. It\u2019s bad for the restaurant. It\u2019s wasteful for food. And it\u2019s bad hospitality. There are so many pop culture references and entire sitcom episodes built around someone trying to get into a restaurant. It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s completely absurd. I looked at our no-show rate at Alinea, data-driven, tracked it. I looked at what we call short-seated tables, like the number of tables that were four people, but only two showed up. The dirty secret there is like, people will go like, \u201cWell, what do you have available?\u201d \u201cWell, I have an 8:30 for four.\u201d \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take that.\u201d They never intended to bring the other two people. That\u2019s just as bad as a two-top no showing. We only have 74 seats in there, so it\u2019s a yield management problem.  So, 5 to 8 percent of our revenue every night was being lost to that transaction. That was a non-transaction. So I wanted to figure out ways to do two things. One, I wanted to figure out a way to make it transactional. Because, again, you asked about Professor Thaler. One of the key tenets is, there\u2019s a little bit of skin in the game, right? When people have a small vested interest in the outcome of something, or even if I gave you a pencil as a gift, and then 30 minutes later I want to take it back, you will get so mad, even though you didn\u2019t care about that pencil. You\u2019re like, \u201cWhat was that? Dude gave me a gift, and now he\u2019s pulling it back,\u201d you know?  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like the expected value of a mug. If you asked them how much they would spend to buy the mug versus giving them the mug and saying, \u201cHow much will you accept to sell it?\u201d The differential.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, it\u2019s huge. So, that came to me one day because my kids wanted to go see a movie at night that I did not want to go see. I would\u2019ve easily paid $50 to not go to this movie. Then my wife basically says, \u201cHey, let\u2019s go to that movie. I go on Fandango. I buy four tickets. $60, whatever it was. At 5:30 at night, pouring rain, and everyone\u2019s napping. They\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cGet your asses in the car, we\u2019re going to the movie, man!\u201d Now I would have easily paid that $60 to not go to the movie, but once I had the sunk cost of paying for the movie, my psychology totally flipped. I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to this movie that I don\u2019t want to go to.\u201d I literally irrationally made everyone go to the movie. Which weirdly cost, from an emotional family standpoint, all bad all the way around, right?  So I thought about it and I was like, \u201cWow, what if people put down a small deposit on times when demand exceeds supply? So like a Saturday night, 8:00, that\u2019s the best seats at the opera house. Let\u2019s see if people will pre-pay for that or put down $20 for it. That\u2019s fully credited at the end of their meal. It\u2019s not a cover charge. I\u2019m not trying to squeeze people on the actual cost of the meal. I\u2019m just trying to go like, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s see if people will make a commitment.\u201d Everybody told me, \u201cNo, no one\u2019s going to do that. This is not the way it works.\u201d But if you look back historically, this is the interesting part. Again, it\u2019s about digging in deep on something.  If you look back historically, restaurant reservations started with the telephone. At the time that we were starting to do this, the telephone was dying. I didn\u2019t know that at the time. That was eight years ago. But I have a computer in my pocket. If you ring me and I don\u2019t know your number, I don\u2019t want to talk to you. I don\u2019t answer it. I\u2019d much rather receive a little piece of text letting me know what\u2019s going on than a phone call. Similarly, like calling a restaurant is an antiquated thing to do at this point. But long before the telephone, people got room and board. What room and board was literally, you go to an inn and you get a room for the night. Then, do you need food? Okay, well, you get a board of food. That was literally it. And you\u2019d prepay for it. There were hundreds of years of that long before there was a telephone and people called and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to eat at your restaurant.\u201d \u201cSure, we\u2019ll let you in.\u201d  As the technology for the telephone has morphed into what we all have in our pockets now, I just wanted to update that whole transaction. I also wanted to acknowledge that Tuesday nights should be cheaper than a Saturday night. It has to work both ways. I always thought Uber could fix their surge pricing issues by having discounted pricing when there was no demand. Just move pricing intelligently without directions. If you move pricing in two directions, that whole argument goes away. So, we did that. We priced out different prices by day of the week and times of day. So 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday at Alinea is still cheaper than 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday. By a lot. By $80 to $100 a person. You know what happens?  We have hundreds of restaurants doing this on our software called Tock. What happens is people buy the most expensive seats first, and the cheapest seats first. Which is exactly what you\u2019d expect, actually. Because some people are price conscious and go like, \u201cWow, this is a really expensive meal, but holy cow, I don\u2019t really care if I eat at 5:00 on Tuesday. Great. I can save $400.\u201d Then there\u2019s some people that go, \u201cI only eat at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday.\u201d Okay, that\u2019s fine. Pay a little more.  Tim Ferriss: Or they\u2019re attracted to the fact that it is the most expensive. Nick Kokonas: Sure. That happens too. Then there\u2019s a whole bunch of tools that over time can be built on top of that to sell wine pairings or sell books. We sell 20 Alinea books a day on checkout with the booking process. That\u2019s a ton. Because we\u2019re not going to exit through the gift shop at Alinea. It\u2019s a Michelin three-star restaurant. So we would subtly have one book near the restrooms that people could peruse, but it didn\u2019t say, \u201cBuy the book\u201d or anything like that. So typically, we\u2019d sell one or two per night. Now on checkout, when you book Alinea, it says, \u201cWould you like to buy an Alinea book, personalized?\u201d 20 people a night get it. That\u2019s $400,000 in revenue a year. It\u2019s crazy, right?  Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s incredible.  Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s amazing to me that no one did that beforehand. Because ultimately, people can\u2019t buy what they don\u2019t see. People don\u2019t want to be upsold inside of a restaurant. There\u2019s nothing worse in my mind \u2013 some places, today\u2019s special is today\u2019s special and it\u2019s real and you know that. But sometimes, it\u2019s just the old fish.  Tim Ferriss: Right. Sunday night.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, right. We all know these things. I think no restaurant wants to raise their hand and go, \u201cYup, that\u2019s all true. We were lying to our customers, and we are not really going to seat you at 8:15.\u201d I think when I said that, you can look back through some articles. I remember that there was an article, I think it was in GQ, that they interviewed a grizzled veteran \u2013 he didn\u2019t use his name \u2013 he said, \u201cAn overbook and a bar to wait in has always worked for me.\u201d I was just like, \u201cHow does that not sound like terrible hospitality to everyone reading that?\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. There are so many systems that have similar overbooking, load-balancing issues, right? You look at airlines, you look at hospitality. Nick Kokonas: My dentist.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah.  Nick Kokonas: I have a great dentist. They only do it via phone call or email. So I have to play a guessing game. It\u2019s like going into a clothing store and going, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking for a blue, V-neck, cashmere sweater.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t have one; guess again.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cPut the shit on display, man. Just tell me what day you can clean my teeth. Show me and I\u2019ll just go online and hit the button.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: When you then debuted the ticketing option, if I\u2019m labeling it properly, how did you prime the pump for that? Did you need to prime the pump to have what certainly seems like a windfall?  Nick Kokonas: We did a video where Next restaurant was about a restaurant that\u2019s always new, essentially. What\u2019s one of the big problems of the restaurant industry? Well, when you open a new restaurant, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is, people are going to show up for like five or six months. Then after that, you\u2019ve got to struggle to get regulars and find new audiences and all that. But people like the \u201cnew,\u201d right? The other problem is that our own staff and chefs were the kind of people who I said to Grant one time, he cooked this amazing French dish at Alinea for me right in the middle of his sickness, because I had driven down from Michigan. I have never eaten before or after in the Alinea kitchen, but he whipped up this little French dish for me of duck. I was like, \u201cMan, let\u2019s open a French restaurant some day.\u201d He went, \u201cEh, we\u2019ll get bored after six months.\u201d  Then I was at one of our chef\u2019s homes on a day off on a Tuesday. He loves Thai food. He made this amazing Thai meal. Amazing. I was like, \u201cWow, I had no idea these guys were so versatile.\u201d Then it made sense. Hey, these are passionate, amazingly talented people. It dawned on me, \u201cLet\u2019s just change the restaurant every four months.\u201d Then we dwelled on that for like a year, thinking it was impossible to do. Then Grant said \u2013 I said, \u201cLet\u2019s start with a French menu.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, what does that mean? There\u2019s southern France, there\u2019s Loire Valley. There\u2019s France that\u2019s nouvelle cuisine. Then there\u2019s France from 100 years ago. Totally different.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, Paris 1906. I don\u2019t need to explain to you what that is. You\u2019d want to eat that.\u201d  If someone said, \u201cNew restaurant opening, what\u2019s the menu? It\u2019s Paris 1906.\u201d I\u2019d go like, \u201cCool, I want to do a little time travel and see what that was like.\u201d So, as soon as we had a city and a time, we instantly knew. That was the idea that kept us up at night. Where we went like, \u201cWow, look at all these different places we can travel, and what does that restaurant look like and how do you create a kitchen versatile enough to make all these different cuisines? How do you make it not feel like Disneyland, where one time you have a theme of Paris, and the next time you have a theme of Japan?\u201d So you have to do with an austere minimalism. Tim Ferriss: Is there a reason why you chose the year 1906?  Nick Kokonas: I\u2019m doing some research, and I may get the exact date wrong, because this is eight years ago that I did the research, but I believe the Seine flooded in 1908. Somewhere around there. And so Escoffier, the father of French cuisine, was at the Ritz then. That was the height of that era of cuisine. Then after the Seine flooded, that\u2019s where you got your brasseries and bistros, because they had to go to a more casual; it opened up for more people. It took the price point down. It made it more approachable. And it wiped out dozens of these fancy restaurants. Rent got cheap and all of a sudden, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to get this new style of restaurant.\u201d That\u2019s roughly, as I recall it. Somebody\u2019s going to listen to this and tell me I\u2019m all wrong. That\u2019s where we landed, because we do this Escoffier menu. Boy, we argued about that too. They didn\u2019t have blenders then, electric blenders.  Tim Ferriss: So, you wanted to mimic the production? Nick Kokonas: I did. Grant did not. I remember we had invited the press to a practice dinner.  Tim Ferriss: Grant\u2019s like, \u201cHey, pal. You don\u2019t have to make the food.\u201d  Nick Kokonas: Well, partly that. But partly he was like, \u201cShould we make it intentionally worse than we can?\u201d Because the recipes were really vague. They didn\u2019t even call for salt. So in the middle of this press dinner where we had The New York Times there, we had all sorts of these people there, which I\u2019ll never do again. That was a genuine error. We were still arguing out conceptually what this thing would be. Then we serve dinner, and we were openly \u2013 he\u2019d come out of the kitchen and we\u2019d openly argue about it.  Tim Ferriss: This is at the press dinner? Nick Kokonas: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember he brought the soup out and I was like, \u201cOh, they must have used the actual blenders, right?\u201d Modern blenders. Because the mouthfeel was perfect. I was like, \u201cOh, you used the blenders?\u201d He was like, \u201cThe recipe didn\u2019t call for salt either, did it? Should I have not used that and had it taste like shit?\u201d Then I was like, \u201cWell, maybe you don\u2019t know that they didn\u2019t have refrigeration then either and they packed the vegetables in salt as a desiccant, so they were almost all pre-salted by the time they got to Paris.\u201d And that was it. People were just like, \u201cThese guys don\u2019t like each other at all.\u201d That was our method. That\u2019s what we did. To the day we opened, we had those arguments. Then in terms of the software, man, I didn\u2019t sleep for a week. We set it up on Rackspace. It didn\u2019t work right. I had never done anything like that before. It was like, no one would help. I think nobody would help.  Tim Ferriss: When you say nobody would help, you mean competitors, potential \u2013 Nick Kokonas: Potential allies, potential, these are people at software companies. Tim Ferriss: I got it. Why wouldn\u2019t they help? Nick Kokonas: In the case of OpenTable, they had a monopoly. So, why \u2013 Tim Ferriss: That makes sense to me.  Nick Kokonas: In terms of everyone else, I think they just didn\u2019t get it. But even people within my own company thought this was a fool\u2019s errand. Grant, for sure, he will fully admit this now, thought it was a terrible idea.  Tim Ferriss: Why did he think it was a terrible idea? Nick Kokonas: Because it\u2019s not hospitable. It\u2019s not hospitality.  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s low touch, not high touch? Nick Kokonas: Correct. And hugely the case where all of a sudden the price is different every day. Are people going to get that? I just kept looking to other industries. No one has a problem with it when they go to a baseball game. They\u2019re not sitting above the dugout and then the guy who\u2019s in the third deck back row looks down and goes, \u201cOh, that guy, he totally stole that ticket from me.\u201d They\u2019re two different price points. I think people inherently get that without having to explain it to them.  Tim Ferriss: If I might, how far in advance of the opening were you hoping to launch the software, and when did you end up launching the software?  Nick Kokonas: I launched it about seven hours before the first dinner.  Tim Ferriss: Holy shit.  Nick Kokonas: I had hoped to have done it four to five weeks ahead of that. It was literally a one-man operation plus me; one programmer and me. When we launched it, Rackspace, this is 2010, I\u2019m not saying anything bad about Rackspace. I probably set it up wrong. 2010. It did not, it\u2019s supposed to auto load correct, and self-propagate. Neither happened. We had 17,000 people on our email list that had signed up on the website to be notified when the bookings went on sale. I was expecting maybe 700 to show up \u2014 should be fine. Something like 8,000 or 9,000 showed up. Everyone just kept hitting the refresh key. Here\u2019s another fatal error of stupidity. This is not the way our software is built now because we have professionals here. But basically, my admin login was on the very same server as everybody\u2019s public access. So I couldn\u2019t even go in to configure.  The good news on this is that I couldn\u2019t answer hundreds of angry emails all at once. So I created a Facebook group for the business, which in 2010 not very many people did. If you go back and scroll all the way down to the beginning of that, you\u2019ll see me going, \u201cHey, if everybody could please stop refreshing, I can sort this out.\u201d What was really cool is that people felt part of something. They felt like \u201cWow, holy shit, this guy is actually doing this himself. We\u2019re part of this experiment and we\u2019re on the inside of it.\u201d I got a lot of empathy from the customers, even though they were the ones that were unable to get what they wanted. Then when it finally started working, I had literally not showered in five days. I had pizza boxes laying around. It looked like a bad movie startup thing. I had a beard. I was just strung out, manic.  I remember I called Grant. It was opening day. He said, \u201cHow many should I prep for?\u201d I said, \u201cPrep for full. Because if not, we\u2019ll turn on the phones.\u201d What I didn\u2019t tell him was that I didn\u2019t order the phones because I didn\u2019t want to have a failsafe.  Tim Ferriss: You\u2019d burned the ships.  Nick Kokonas: I just wanted to make sure I forced myself to work. We had no phone line. When it started working, I would double-click, one of the functions was double-click on a table. If it was yellow, it was held; the public couldn\u2019t see it. I could make it available by double-clicking it and it would turn green. Then when it was sold, it would turn red. But the first time I did that to let more inventory out, and clearly things were working, it turned red so fast, I thought it was broken. So then I went into the credit card processing and saw, \u201cOh, my gosh, someone bought that that fast.\u201d I called Grant and I said, \u201cDude, you\u2019ve got to come to my house.\u201d He was like, \u201cUh, we\u2019re opening a restaurant in like six hours. What\u2019s going on?\u201d I said, \u201cAs the guy who helped save your life, get in a fucking taxi and come over here, because I need to show you something!\u201d He looked at me and went like, \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d I took him upstairs to my office and I explained to him what I just explained to you. I said, \u201cClick on one of those and make it available.\u201d He said, \u201cWhich one?\u201d I go, \u201cAny one in the next month.\u201d He clicked like three weeks out at 9:30. It instantly turned red. In another window, I had the credit card thing up. I go, \u201cLook, Mr. Jones bought that.\u201d He went, \u201cReally?\u201d I went, \u201cYup, there are 4,000 people waiting for you to do that right now.\u201d That was the moment at which I was basically like, \u201cThis is the best thing I\u2019ve ever built.\u201d Because it was functionally different than any way that anybody was doing this. It wasn\u2019t novel. It was just applied in a novel way. What was interesting is that, of course, the software itself sucked. But as a proof of concept, it was awesome.  Tim Ferriss: Quick question on that, if you\u2019re comfortable answering. How much money had you put into developing the software at that point, roughly? Nick Kokonas: I\u2019m going to say $115,000, roughly. Tim Ferriss: In your mind, were you completely confident it would work? Or \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t have to be A or B; there could be C, D, E, F \u2014 or were you like, \u201cFor $115k or whatever it might be, even if you budgeted for less and it overran, even if there\u2019s a 20 percent chance that this works, it is worth risking the hours and time because it will so completely transform what we\u2019re doing, and if it fucking fails, who cares?\u201d Nick Kokonas: Correct. The latter one, yeah. Again, it\u2019s about the asymmetric risk, right? It was also about this thing as I dug into how Alinea ran, there\u2019s thing that you can fix and control, and there\u2019s things you can\u2019t. This was the one that I would answer phones at Alinea and it was like being a therapist. People would go like, \u201cI would like to make a reservation on my anniversary, seven weeks from now on a Thursday.\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, sir, it\u2019s totally full.\u201d 100 percent of the time they thought you were lying to them. Consequently, I realized that we were saying \u201cNo\u201d to people more than we were saying \u201cYes.\u201d That even when we said \u201cNo\u201d in a nice way and took 10 minutes to do so, people thought that we were lying, or that they weren\u2019t important to us, or any of those things.  I felt that transparency was actually more important than the actual money and the actual yield management. I felt like allowing people to see the entirety of the inventory was the most important thing. I had the same thing with the trading markets. They\u2019ve moved to more and more transparency, more and more speed. This is true across every industry. I just felt like \u201cWow, this industry I found myself in was so backwards.\u201d I just wanted to make the whole thing more transparent. Even if it didn\u2019t go beyond my own restaurants, I was totally fine with that. In fact, I didn\u2019t do anything with it for four years. I didn\u2019t really intend on making it a software product. I intended to fix my own problems. I think often that\u2019s where good ideas come from.  Tim Ferriss: Super often. The scratching of your own itch. At least you know you have a market of one. Guaranteed market of one. I also want to point out, we were talking about asymmetric risk earlier, and you\u2019re like, \u201cI want to stand to make 3-4x what I stand to lose.\u201d If you run the math, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing a lot of subtleties here, but when you said we booked $500,000 and it cost $115,000, we\u2019re getting very much within the ballpark of that. Nick Kokonas: Yeah, but I didn\u2019t even, well, since then, we\u2019ve taken our margins at our restaurants from 10 to 12 percent to at times in good months, 20 to 25 percent. In an industry that over the last five years, if you read \u2013 I give a talk called Tuesday is not Saturday, and Seven Things You Already Now But Are Doing Nothing About. It\u2019s a talk that I give to the restaurant industry. One of the things that I point out in there is that there\u2019s so many obvious things that you could be doing to improve your hospitality, to improve your booking process, to get rid of food waste. But people tend to just kind of move along because it\u2019s a really chaotic environment. It\u2019s hard to make change in it because every day is game day. You wake up every day and 100 people are going to come through the door. If your fishmonger doesn\u2019t show up, you need to figure out what to do with that.  It\u2019s not really about the return on that one investment at that one moment. It\u2019s more like 1,000 small improvements over time. If I look back at that system that I built then compared to what we have now, it\u2019s a miniscule part of what it turned into. But it was the seed of an idea, which is more important, which is, \u201cHey, let\u2019s shake things up.\u201d Then I got a great CFO, who was at Bain Consulting. He came on to help manage the building of Next. When he said he wanted to build out a business team, I was like, \u201cGreat. Run with it.\u201d So we\u2019ve built out food cost analysis that uses Marimekko charts. It\u2019s totally different because it\u2019s visual. You give that to the chef and \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It uses what charts? Nick Kokonas: Marimekko. If you don\u2019t know Marimekko \u2013 if you get nothing out of this, one of the greatest visualizations in charts that you could do in Excel or whatever. It\u2019s hard to do vocally, but imagine a square where each of your x-axis is the percentage of let\u2019s say food cost. Then each square within there is meat or produce. But the whole of the square is 100 percent. The y-axis is 100 percent of one metric, and the x-axis is 100 percent of another. So, you could look at any given square and see how much that impacts the whole. It becomes like a big LEGO building with different colors. If you give a busy chef 400 receipts and say, \u201cHey, every Friday look through these and figure out what we\u2019re spending too much on.\u201d Or, worse, \u201cHey, your food costs last month were at 36%; I need them at 32%.\u201d  You can\u2019t take percentages to the bank. Let\u2019s talk about dollars. Let\u2019s see where we can save some dollars. Or the revenues could have just gone down that month for whatever reason. August in New York. So, it\u2019s not really a good way to look at it. But you give this person this chart, this Marimekko \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Now, Marimekko, I\u2019m looking \u2013 Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s the guy\u2019s name.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It\u2019s M-A-R-I-M-E-K-K-O chart. Is that right? Nick Kokonas: Again, I\u2019m not good at spelling, but sure.  Tim Ferriss: I think so. There is a Google result for \u201chow to make a Marimekko chart,\u201d in Excel, so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s probably it. There\u2019s some YouTube videos as well. So I\u2019ll put those in the show notes for people.  Nick Kokonas: Man, I\u2019ve got to tell you, from a utility perspective, you show that to a person, you explain it visually, when you see it, it makes much more sense and they instantly get it. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no way I spent that much on fish last month.\u201d Instantly.  Tim Ferriss: This can be used for things outside?  Nick Kokonas: Everything. Tim Ferriss: Not just food, not just restaurants.  Nick Kokonas: No, no, no. It\u2019s just a great visualization of utility. Consultants love it. I\u2019ve got to tell you, I don\u2019t love consultants, in general. But if I\u2019ve learned anything from the best consultant that I\u2019ve ever hired, who is now my partner and CFO, he came up with this and as soon as I saw it, I was like, \u201cHow did this not enter my life until my 40th year? This makes no sense.\u201d It\u2019s just incredibly useful. My point is that we went through everything in the restaurant and went like, \u201cWhat are the biggest spending areas that we can analyze?\u201d It\u2019s true in any endeavor that you\u2019re doing. There\u2019s no point in looking at the dimes if you\u2019ve got something that costs $1,000. Start there.  That\u2019s getting into our thoughts on our publicity, our PR. We don\u2019t have a professional PR person, and haven\u2019t in 14 1/2 years. We don\u2019t spend money on any promotions other than social media. Then with the social media, we track all of that. We can see what our ROI is on a boosted post. We can see what our ROI is if we advertise on your podcast. That\u2019s why these mediums are working, is because they\u2019re measurable.  Tim Ferriss: I was looking up, just as you were chatting as I was also looking for Marimekko, a quote that I think applies. You may certainly feel free to disagree, but it applies very well to a lot of the breakthroughs that you have experienced, and also helped to catalyze in a lot of what you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a quote from Charlie Munger who, for those who don\u2019t know, you should definitely take a look at Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack. He\u2019s the right-hand or, I shouldn\u2019t even say that. He is the investing partner of Warren Buffett. He\u2019s a fascinating human being. But one of the quotes of his that I really return to a lot when I think I might be outsmarting myself in some way, or in general, as a reminder is, \u201cIt is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid instead of trying to be very intelligent.\u201d  Because as you noted earlier, you have these practices that are being implemented by otherwise, in many cases, smart people who have just not taken the time to ask \u201cWhy are we doing this? Why does this exist?\u201d as the thing. Like you pointed out, it\u2019s so obvious once you reframe it. You walk into a clothing store and they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d \u201cNope, sorry. Guess again.\u201d That\u2019s fucking ridiculous. And yet, that\u2019s exactly the way it works in many other places.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah. Once you start down that road of thinking that way, it will drive you a little nutty. Because you can\u2019t do every business. There\u2019s a couple things that I\u2019ve got in my back pocket that I\u2019m like, \u201cOne day I\u2019m going to arbitrage truffles.\u201d Because there\u2019s an opaque market that\u2019s absurd. Here\u2019s an example. I\u2019m going to give somebody out there \u2013 call me up because this is a real business idea, and I\u2019ve been wanting to do it for years. But black-and-white truffles \u2013 not the chocolate ones, but the kind that the dogs dig up in France and Italy \u2013 are as expensive as the most expensive drugs in the world. You order them as if it were an illegal drug. Of course, they\u2019re perfectly legal. But you call up a truffle dealer and you go, \u201cWhat do they cost?\u201d \u201cWell, they\u2019re $650 a pound right now for black truffles, $1,600 for white.\u201d  You try to talk them down a little bit. You make sure that you get the best quality because, hey, we\u2019re Alinea and we\u2019ll ship you back the stuff we don\u2019t like and all that. Then in an unmarked box stacked with newspaper will come $20,000 of truffles. Good for like a week, by the way. This is not a big supply. It is completely opaque as a market. There is no mycologist touching these. There are knock-offs \u2013 well, not knock-offs. There\u2019s different species and quality from Australia, from Tennessee, from China, etc. that they cut into it. Sound familiar? We spend a lot of money on truffles every year. Try to figure out what the U.S. market in the fall truffle season is worth? You can\u2019t. It\u2019s exactly like publishing. You can\u2019t find numbers. Whenever I see something like that, I\u2019m like, someone\u2019s guarding their golden goose.  Tim Ferriss: Whenever it\u2019s a black box, you\u2019re like, I feel like I am not on the best side of this trade.  Nick Kokonas: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I did. I did a closing in cellular network between the Merc and the AMEX to arbitrage ETFs to get rid of the phone brokers in the middle. That took me like a year and a half to get through the Merc and AMEX powers that be. I read most of the CFTC, so when they would tell me it\u2019s not in the rules or not legal or whatever.  Tim Ferriss: CFTC is the Chicago Trade something Commission?  Nick Kokonas: No, this is the Federal Commodities Trading Commission.  Tim Ferriss: I see.  Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s like the SEC, but for commodities. Again, sit down and actually read that some day. What\u2019s amazing is that the experts never \u2013 it\u2019s like the members of Congress who don\u2019t read the bill. Then if you ask them detailed instructions on it, they\u2019re like, oh, yeah, I don\u2019t really know, but the general tenor is this or that. The people who were governing the exchanges, had never read the rules. So, they would just quote to me like, well, it\u2019s against the rules. I was like, well, here are the seven volumes; please show me where. If not, I\u2019m going to do it. Similarly, truffles, same thing. The booking for the restaurant, same thing.  OpenTable had a monopoly. They wouldn\u2019t tell you who your customers were. They would sell your customers, they still do, to other restaurants. If you\u2019re full one night, they\u2019ll just send you down the street to a Japanese restaurant down the street. They don\u2019t care. I wanted to get rid of all that, so I built the software for that. Truffles, I will someday build a truffle exchange.  Tim Ferriss: So, a question for you. This is something also for, this is maybe just turning this into a therapy session/coaching session for myself. I get attracted like a moth to the flame to puzzles.  Nick Kokonas: I\u2019ve got a puzzle for you.  Tim Ferriss: No, no. I don\u2019t need any more puzzles. I need no more puzzles. But there are many black boxes are there. You have truffles. Like you said, what\u2019s the market size of the truffle exchange at x point in time? Don\u2019t know. Although you guys, as one establishment or multiple establishments, buy a lot. There might be 100 different black boxes like that, that you run into. How do you choose the black boxes worth trying to shine light on like a detective? Because it\u2019s going to consume energy, it\u2019s going to consume time. How do you pick and choose which to go after?  Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s like the manic test. It\u2019s like the one that bothers me the most, I start doing. Then it\u2019s iterative from there. Sometimes you find yourself in a construction of your own doing that was accidental. All of a sudden, you kind of opened your mouth and said something like the truffle thing and all of sudden, oh, okay, I guess we\u2019re building a truffle exchange. I feel like The Boring company\u2019s like that for Musk. He opened his mouth and like, \u201cYeah, dig big tunnels.\u201d He\u2019s got enough credibility now where some engineers went like, \u201cYeah, we can dig tunnels that are seismically fine. Oh, you work for SpaceX? Okay. Let\u2019s see if you can dig a tunnel!\u201d I don\u2019t think that was a business plan. He just has a lot of credibility at this point. I think that to a certain extent, a lot of people have a lot of ideas; they just don\u2019t dig down that rabbit hole. I do some as a hobby.  I do some where I have someone that I like within our company and say, \u201cWell, if you really wanted to be independent and do something cool, here\u2019s a project. Learn more about this and start researching it.\u201d We have 300-and-some employees on the restaurant side and about 50 on Tock. Many of them are incredibly hardworking and intelligent. When someone says, \u201cHey, I want to learn how to be more entrepreneurial,\u201d I take one of my black boxes out and say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see if that\u2019s true, because this is going to take you six months of independent work without any guidance, and you\u2019re going to get tired of it really fast. Or you\u2019re going to come back to me and say, \u2018Hey, you know what? I can\u2019t figure out the total value of the truffle market in the United States.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, yeah, no shit, that\u2019s why I asked you to do it!\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Now when you give them an assignment like this, \u201cYou know what, boss? I really want to be an entrepreneur.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cCongratulations. I am now giving you a project, and (a) it\u2019s on your time and you\u2019re not getting paid for it.\u201d Or do you pay for it? Nick Kokonas: No, no, no. I never take \u2013 every single intern that works at our restaurants for a minute is paid.  Tim Ferriss: So they do get paid for the black box time? Nick Kokonas: Oh, yeah, of course. I would never \u2013 I think one of the things I really dislike actually, are industries where they say, \u201cHey, you\u2019re in college or whatever, be an intern.\u201d Then your parents say, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a great opportunity for you to learn something\u201d and all that. It\u2019s like, well, if you\u2019re not getting paid, you\u2019re not being valued, frankly. For me, we pay everybody. Nobody who\u2019s working here \u2013 I do expect that salaried people are going to work more than just the time here. I think that people who are passionately curious will be given a problem like that and will come up with interesting solutions to find out what the answer may be. That\u2019s enough.  Tim Ferriss: I want to add some commentary on the question that I asked, which is I think it\u2019s incredible that you do pay them for that independent research, which is also acting an entrepreneurial training/filtering for them. But I wouldn\u2019t have judged you harshly at all if you said, no, that\u2019s on their own time. The reason I say that is that if you are going to be investigating black boxes as an entrepreneur, there are going to be periods of time where you are doing it in the evenings; you are doing it on the weekends; you are doing it without a clear road to immediate cash flow, right? So I wouldn\u2019t have judged you if you said, \u201cYou know what? I am paying them full time for their normal job, but if they want to tackle one of these black boxes, that\u2019s considered extracurricular time.\u201d So I wouldn\u2019t have judged you harshly if you had responded in the negative on that.  Nick Kokonas: I guess to back up a little bit, when there are people who I don\u2019t know who do not work for our company, and they call me up and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got this idea for X, Y, Z\u201d or whatever and it\u2019s intriguing enough, I will pose some more difficult questions. But they\u2019re not working for me, you know what I mean? There\u2019s a guy who brought me a food product about a year ago. It was interesting, but not super compelling. I said, \u201cIf you did these five things, it would be a lot more compelling for me to be involved and to help with it and all that.\u201d Yesterday, I got a box in the mail, and he had done not only the five things I said, but said, \u201cHey, when I started doing those, these seven other things popped up. Here\u2019s where the product is. Here\u2019s the people we signed. Here\u2019s the airline we just signed to carry the product. I would love to have you still involved, even though we\u2019re so much farther down the road than I thought I\u2019d be a year later.\u201d That\u2019s super cool.  I didn\u2019t pay that guy, obviously. But there\u2019s a person who\u2019s truly entrepreneurial and did this on his own time. But if they\u2019re working here, if they work for the Alinea Group, if they work for Tock, for sure you could take time during your day during your normal business that\u2019s a project that we\u2019re working on. We also try not to have such harshly defined roles, not within the restaurant. If you\u2019re a server, if you\u2019re a captain, if you\u2019re a line cook, you\u2019re probably not working on my truffle project, realistically. But on the business side, we certainly have people who work in roles as a lawyer or an analyst or something like that who want to get involved with our publishing project, or who want to get involved with the truffle project, or whatever it may be. I\u2019m happy to pull them in and try to include them. Like you said, you used a word as an entrepreneurial filter. I would say 95 percent of the time, people filter themselves out.  Tim Ferriss: Right. I agree with that. They\u2019re going to self-select or self-select out. Are there any particular books or resources that you have found useful on hiring or managing?  Nick Kokonas: If you found one, let me know. Hiring is so hard. I think it\u2019s the hardest of all things to do. I think my style of interviewing people is totally different than it was 20 years ago. We used the word \u201cself-selecting\u201d just a moment ago. It\u2019s exactly what I do. I kind of bring people in. I let them know what I\u2019m about, what the company\u2019s about. They\u2019ve probably already been interviewed by other people before they get to me. At that point, I let them know what the upsides and downsides of working here are. I let them know what the expectations are. Then I tell them people self-select into a job. You don\u2019t want to come here if you\u2019re going to fail, because that would be terrible. I don\u2019t want you to come here and fail, because that would be a waste of my time and resources and would also feel awful. It\u2019s never good to let go of someone. It feels terrible.  Let\u2019s see if you are self-selecting in. What do you want to know? I\u2019ll be completely transparent about what\u2019s good, what\u2019s bad, what\u2019s good about working for me, personally. The fact that maybe you\u2019ll never see me again. It\u2019s a big enough organization where there are definitely people working here who I don\u2019t know at all. But people tend to join organizations where they want to work. I try to make them be able to say no easier than they can say yes.  Tim Ferriss: What would be some examples of how you do that?  Nick Kokonas: I judge the person by what their pain points are. One of the things I like to ask, which kind of resonates probably with you, I say, what are the last five books you read? I\u2019ve got to tell you, that\u2019s a really hard question to answer. Even if you\u2019re a voracious reader, it\u2019s really hard. You remember a book from two years ago, but you can\u2019t remember the one you read two months ago, sometimes. At least I can\u2019t. That is a great filter on people. A couple things will happen. One, the person who is a voracious reader will go, \u201cOh, my God, I swear to God I read like 20 books this year. Let\u2019s see.\u201d Then they will really start going, \u201cOh, I read one three months ago that was this and it was about that.\u201d You can tell that they\u2019re intellectually curious and read a lot. You\u2019ll also get a person who goes, \u201cLook, I haven\u2019t read a book in 20 years, but every night I go home and I do woodworking, and that\u2019s my outlet. That\u2019s where I focus. That\u2019s my Zen moment.\u201d That\u2019s a valid answer to that question, too. You don\u2019t have to be a reader. Some people will just lie through their teeth. They\u2019ll answer what they think is the smart answer to that question. I don\u2019t want that person there. Tim Ferriss: I read War and Peace, and then I went to The Problems of Philosophy.  Nick Kokonas: Yes, yes, yes. Then The 4-Hour Workweek, right?  Tim Ferriss: Definitely not the right answer.  Nick Kokonas: So there\u2019s that, and I ask that kind of question. But then things like, \u201cDo you enjoy writing?\u201d One of my things is, if someone doesn\u2019t like to write, when people ask what I do for a living, I say, \u201cI\u2019m a writer.\u201d They go like, \u201cOh, you\u2019ve written a couple books?\u201d I go, \u201cNo, no, no. I write about 400 emails a day.\u201d That skill is hugely important right now. If someone doesn\u2019t like to write, they\u2019re not going to want to work for me. Because when they send out an email and I\u2019m CCed on it and it isn\u2019t a well-thought-out little thing, the answer coming back is, \u201cHey, here\u2019s four ways to improve this.\u201d At some point, it\u2019ll be like, \u201cReally? You did that same mistake again?\u201d It comes off kind of harsh in email.  So if you\u2019re the kind of person that doesn\u2019t take feedback well or doesn\u2019t want to learn, man, I am lacking patience for that at this point in my life. I let them know that. Some people look at you and just go like, \u201cYeah, dude, I don\u2019t want to work there.\u201d More than I would think. Which is great.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it simplifies matters.  Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s done with a smile. I\u2019m not trying to terrorize people when they come in and interview. Then there\u2019s some people that go like, awesome. That\u2019s exactly what I want. We have everything from double-Ph.D. engineers to people who\u2019ve never attended a university for a minute, but they\u2019ve self-selected into an organization that people ask a lot of questions. I love that I can be in a room and come up with an idea, and everyone there will just be like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great idea. There\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be able to do that in the next six months, because that\u2019s not in our capacity at our size right now.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: I think a question on a lot of people\u2019s minds, and a pain point for most people listening, will be email. So you seem to be at least confident in your treatment of email. 400 is a lot of email. Do you have any particular commandments? Dos, do nots, times you check, things you check first? Any types of systems or approaches that allow you to maintain a degree of sanity with the amount of email that you must receive?  Nick Kokonas: You\u2019re going to hate this answer, Tim. I am terrible at it. It used to be not so long ago that I personally replied to absolutely every single email that came in myself. I used to have an auto-sign that basically was like, if I don\u2019t reply to you within five minutes, I\u2019m dead or asleep. It\u2019s the opposite of everything you stand for. I know that. I was listening to Jason Fried \u2013 Jason Fried\u2019s a friend \u2013 I was listening to his podcast with you. I don\u2019t get it at all. I would love nothing more than to re-work or to not work, work four-day weeks or have six-week projects and all the stuff that he espouses. He\u2019s a friend. He\u2019s an investor in one of my businesses. But man, that\u2019s not how I function at all. I weirdly think that he misses cause-and-effect a little bit. He has a very successful company, and that\u2019s the cause that allows the effect, which is the ability to manage your time really well.  I live really paranoid. I\u2019m more comfortable that way. Also, I feel a weird moral responsibility to reply to the people who\u2019ve taken their time out of their day to write us a note, even if it\u2019s not critical business for me. One of the things that I did for about 10 years, that I loved doing when we first started Alinea, was I would have Google Alerts set up and I would find some blog that only some woman and her mother read. I would reply personally. \u201cWow, thank you for the great write-up of Alinea.\u201d They would be mind-blown that I found it and all that. I treated email that way for a long period of time. Unfortunately, now I can\u2019t quite do that.  So I do have a bunch of filters and whatnot, but I didn\u2019t even set them up. My business partner, Brian Fitzpatrick, who used to be the head of Google in Chicago, he runs the engineering team and he\u2019s the CEO of Tock, he said, \u201cDude, you\u2019re slipping, man. You need to create some filters and get some stuff that\u2019s directly to you.\u201d So he went into my Gmail accounts and forced the issue for me. So now I can\u2019t quite do that. I do wake up in the morning and look at our bazillion social media messages and whatnot, kind of pick a random one, and just answer it. I want to be involved in knowing what our customers are asking, what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re saying, what they\u2019re replying. Anything that\u2019s a complaint actually gets brought directly via email to a complaint tracker that me and Grant see.  So, luckily, there aren\u2019t that many of those. But any time you serve 5,000 or 6,000 people a week, you\u2019re going to get something going wrong. But man, I\u2019m terrible at it, honestly. I will tell you a funny thing is that when I go away on vacation, I do try to concoct a pretty funny \u2013 I basically say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to be on a mountain or on a boat or whatever, and I\u2019m not going to be able to reply. I would make these elaborate stories up, almost as like a fun piece of art project as to why I couldn\u2019t do it. One year, every time I went away, I basically said, \u201cI\u2019m going to visit a panda I adopted and going back to Chicago.\u201d It ended the year around Christmastime when I went on break with a picture of a baby panda, and a really mediocre Photoshop job of me standing there with the panda.  The Chicago Tribune called me up like three days later, like, \u201cIs it going to the Lincoln Park Zoo?\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, dear God, it\u2019s not. There is no panda.\u201d That\u2019s what I wrote back. That was my terrible reply to that. The following year, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk, as you might be able to tell.\u201d So everyone who knows me knows that I can just go on and on. I said I was going to a combination of a tantric sex retreat and silence retreat for eight days to explore my both inner and outer selves. I made some elaborate story.  Tim Ferriss: This is your out-of-office reply. Nick Kokonas: That\u2019s my out-of-office reply. Anybody would get that, right? I thought that was really funny. Then about two years later, I bumped into some guy who worked for a very big corporation. They wanted to do some work with the Alinea Group. It was kind of a consulting project; very lucrative. He was looking at me really funny. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I really wished we had worked together, but then you went to that sex retreat, and I just couldn\u2019t get it past everybody.\u201d I was looking at him going, like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Then I remembered like four years earlier, my out-of-office reply. I told him it was a joke, like the panda. He did not find any humor in it. I did. I thought it was hilarious, even though we lost the business, I thought it was really funny. So if you ever get a really unusual out-of-office reply from me, it\u2019s fiction. Probably.  Tim Ferriss: I love that. If you\u2019re serious all the time, you\u2019re never going to get the actual serious work done. You\u2019re going to burn out before that ever happens. I also want to underscore one thing. Then I want to ask you about a black box that you and I have talked about quite a bit, which is publishing. The fact that you pick a message to reply to, even if it\u2019s one, is really important. I\u2019ve noticed this certainly with the audits that I have, listeners, readers, etc. It is not physically possible for me to reply to everyone; it would also be anathema to everything that I\u2019m espousing in many of the books.  But I do want to demonstrate that I am listening. I think that it goes a really long way, even if you do not personally reply to people, if you are able to prove that you\u2019re paying attention. That seems to resolve a lot, or at least act as a salve for people out there who very seldomly feel heard, which does not always necessitate a response. I just wanted to point out that it might seem like a drop in the ocean, but it actually has further reaching implications when you do what you were describing.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, I feel like it\u2019s genuine. First of all, I\u2019m always curious what people are writing about to the restaurants, what they are writing about to me. My LinkedIn profile basically \u2013 I don\u2019t really read LinkedIn at all. I keep it. I think it\u2019s important to have it, but I don\u2019t ever read the messages on there. But in my bio, it basically says \u201cIf you can find my email address, I will incite this; I will reply to you. So that gets rid of all of the marketing crap that comes in. But every now and then, I get a subject line to the email address that\u2019s on there that says \u201cHey, via your LinkedIn bio,\u201d I\u2019ll read that and reply. It just shows me that (a) there\u2019s an actual human on the other line; it\u2019s not just some marketing thing, and (b) they really do have something that they want to talk about.  It\u2019s little things like that are puzzle filters, that I call them. Where I just create a little bit of a barrier. If you\u2019re really into it and you really want to talk to me, you can pretty find me pretty easily. I\u2019m not that hidden.  Tim Ferriss: The detail is really important here. The mini-hurdle. I have a friend I\u2019m not going to mention by name because he\u2019ll get deluged, but he is a very successful author and journalist. When he is hiring for different positions, part-time or full-time, at the bottom of the job description on a job site or wherever it might be, in small print at the very bottom. It will say, do not send a message on this platform. Do not send an email, even though an email address is given earlier. Call this number and leave a voicemail answering the following things. Automatically, he takes the pool of 1,000 people who are going to do the wrong thing, and finds the 10 people who are actually paying attention.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, 100 percent.  Tim Ferriss: Publishing. We didn\u2019t really talk much about it. Can you give just a tiny bit of background on The Aviary, and then some of your related publishing investigations? Which I think is not an inappropriate word. If you could give people a little bit of context.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, I\u2019m going to back up before The Aviary, just a little bit. For a chef, doing a cookbook is something that they dream about if they\u2019re a serious chef, from the time they\u2019re 15. Just like if you\u2019re a basketball player, you want to make the NBA. Or if you\u2019re a runner, you want to be in the Olympics or whatever. To Grant, to a bunch of chefs, having their own ideas in a physical, beautiful cookbook is a holy grail for them. It\u2019s very sacred. What was interesting is that just before Grant was sick, we started to get a lot of publishing offers. The natural inclination was to go to what he knew, which was Artisan Press, which published The French Laundry book, which is one of the bestselling, high-end cookbooks ever. It\u2019s certainly beautiful. It was very revolutionary at its time. I think it was published in about \u201998 or \u201999, something like that.  The typical publishing deal came into us, which was great that they were coming in. It was $250,000 to $300,000. They would basically say, well, out of that, you\u2019re going to pay for the designer and the photographer, and you need a 30-day photoshoot. Here are the guidelines for how many photos you want in the book, to keep costs down, and all that. I looked at all that, and all the offers came within about 10 percent of each other, which immediately the hair on the back of my neck, the Spidey sense starts telling me that something back there is pricing this is an unusual way. Then I started going, \u201cOh, this is actually like the music industry.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Very much so.  Nick Kokonas: Because I knew people in bands that would get signed to a record label back in the day, and they would get a quarter million dollar advance. Shit. That seems like a lot of money, right? Then all of a sudden, all your studio time comes out of that, and you don\u2019t recoup another dime until you\u2019ve sold X number of records or CDs or, in this case, books. Then in the contract, it actually said, and the restaurant guarantees that they will buy 2,500 books at half of retail price. I was like, whoa. You\u2019re looking at something like $80,000 right there. That goes right back to them, in essence. Then I went like, \u201cWell, I wonder what a book costs to print?\u201d  I asked them, \u201cHow much is this book going to cost to print?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know.\u201d So what they would do is they would always have layers of people, so they said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I do. I am the person that does this. The lawyer gives the contract. The printer does the printing.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s always a plausible deniability or a plausible ignorance.  Nick Kokonas: Yes. Willful, plausible ignorance. And so I do what I start doing. Well, let\u2019s just Google that up and see what it costs to print a book. Or, \u201cHey, how many copies of The French Laundry books sold? How many copies of 50 other books that we wanted to emulate or that we thought were well done sold?\u201d Man, it\u2019s like asking for keys to the Vatican or something when you call a publisher and ask them that. I\u2019m sure you know this, right? You probably know now because you\u2019ve been so entrenched in the industry. You know your numbers, and you might know that of some of your colleagues and friends, right? But if you wanted to actually do a meaningful comparison across the industry, it\u2019s almost impossible to do it, even though there\u2019s a company that does that.  Then you start trying to reverse engineer it and you go to The New York Times. You can go to The New York Times website and just look at how is The New York Times Best Seller created? On their own site, they say it\u2019s a compendium of known publishers, like publishing houses, as well as these top 50 retailers, back in the day. It\u2019s a gameable system. The way that the publishers want to do it is that they want to ship out all the books at the same time, because that\u2019s how they\u2019re counted for The New York Times Best Seller list and stuff.  Tim Ferriss: I should also note it\u2019s not only gameable, but it\u2019s also conversely highly subjective within The New York Times. So there\u2019s a lot of wiggle room. In other words, it is not like the Olympics, where clear gold, silver, bronze video replay. We know exactly how this was tabulated.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, so the more that we dug, the more we got more and more curious, and a little bit angry, actually. But Grant was weirdly angry at me, because he\u2019s going like, \u201cDude, why do you care? I\u2019ve been wanting this since I was 15.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, look, if this is our budget, it\u2019s not going to be the book you want. It\u2019s not going to be as good as you want it to be because we\u2019re not going to be able to spend six months doing the photography. We\u2019re not going to be able to get great pages. We\u2019re not going to be able to get a picture of every dish.\u201d What do people cook in a cookbook? Well, they tend to cook those pages where they see a picture of the final dish. Because you know what? It looks delicious. You know what it\u2019s supposed to look like. You\u2019ve got something to emulate at least.  When we did the specs for the book, I had one of the best publishers in America say, \u201cIf you do that book, there\u2019s no way you sell more than 5,000 of them. No way. No one\u2019s going to publish it. You can\u2019t use metric. You can\u2019t use a gram scale. You can\u2019t have that font. You can\u2019t have those pictures in full bleed. And it\u2019ll cost way too much to print.\u201d And so it took about a month and a half before I got lucky and I called a print broker, who had actually brokered the print job of one of the famous books. I was expecting that if the book retailed for $60, it would cost like $15 to print, $20? I didn\u2019t know anything about it. When he told me it was like $2.23 per book to print per a 30,000 copy run, I went, \u201cNo way,\u201d like that. He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s probably less now.\u201d Like, he thought I meant it was too much.  Instantaneously, I went, \u201cOh, shit. Everything makes sense.\u201d When I would call publishers and tell them this, they would go \u201cOh, yeah, but look. We did 40 different books last year. Only five of them did well.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s your problem, man. I know we\u2019re going to sell well. I don\u2019t really give a shit if you lost 35 percent of the time, and you need to spread your portfolio risk. I\u2019m the one you\u2019re spreading it on.\u201d We decided with the Alinea book, we put together like 20 pages, and Martin made this beautiful, stainless steel bracketing system, and we shipped it out to eight different publishers we like. Two of which were art houses that had never done a cookbook. They all came back and said all the usual criticism, except Aaron Wehner at Ten Speed Press.  Tim Ferriss: Smart guy, by the way.  Nick Kokonas: He basically said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you an unusual offer. No advance at all. We can negotiate. Essentially, we\u2019ll just be the distributor. We\u2019ll negotiate out what that looks like, and we\u2019ll help you with the printing, and we\u2019ll help you with the editing, which we\u2019re both really good at.\u201d Within 10 minutes, we had struck a deal whereby any of the books that we bought or sold for ourselves for our restaurant, we paid actual printing cost. Not wholesale, actual printing cost. Anything that they sold and distributed through their channels, they would get about 27% of the sale price, which means that we got 73% of that. These are state secrets. Nobody tells this stuff.  For years, I was walking around with this knowledge where if we sold 100,000 books, that would be the equivalent of selling like 500,000 books on any other deal. And we got to control the quality of it. We won both the James Beard award for best cooking from a professional point of view, best cookbook of the year. We won, I say we, Martin and Laura Kastner, won the communication arts award. Where if you\u2019re a designer, their annual is like getting the Oscar.  Tim Ferriss: Similarly, for people who don\u2019t know it, the James Beard awards are also very much like the Oscars.  Nick Kokonas: Yeah. So, we felt really vindicated on that. The book still sells. This is eight years later. We still sell 7,000 to 8,000 copies a year. When we did The Aviary, which is our bar that\u2019s a non-bar that we talked about earlier, we started getting all of the same offers again. This time, it was really easy to go, \u201cHa, ha!\u201d Just go, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cute.\u201d I should add that Grant and I wrote his memoir together that we didn\u2019t use a ghostwriter, we wrote it ourselves, called Life, on the Line. That one, we did a traditional book deal, but after our agent got it halfway, I got on a plane and flew out there, and then brokered the deal myself. I got a giant multiple of the highest bid by doing essentially a reverse Dutch auction. Starting at a really high price and working my way downward.  Tim Ferriss: Can you explain to people just briefly what that means?  Nick Kokonas: Yeah, basically, I\u2019ll do this. I think one of the great problems to solve, one of the black boxes, is the agency problem. Let\u2019s say you want to sell your house. You put it on the market and the agent is going to get, I don\u2019t know, 4 to 5 percent of the sale price. That\u2019s a lot for something that\u2019s your biggest investment in your life. But they say, they control the information, they control the MLS, and all that. Will they, if they\u2019re the seller\u2019s agent, get the highest price for you? The answer is almost certainly not, because let\u2019s say a house is going to sell for $500,000; they\u2019re going to get 4 percent of that. That\u2019s $20,000. If they get $490,000, it\u2019s almost no different to them. Right? $400 difference. But if they lose the deal over that last $10,000, it\u2019s a lot.  So they want to price a home so that it sells quickly, so that they can keep their deal flow going. They don\u2019t really care about maximizing their last dollar. Whereas for you, that last dollar is actually like $9,600. It\u2019s a lot more money. So what I do whenever I\u2019ve sold real estate is I figure out what the intrinsic value is of the house. What\u2019s the bare minimum that I\u2019d be willing to sell it for? I price it just slightly higher than that, and I tell all the agents in the whole town, \u201cI will pay you 50 percent of everything over 10 percent higher than that.\u201d They all say, \u201cThat\u2019s against the real estate ethics code,\u201d or, \u201cI would never do that deal because it would subvert all of my other deals\u201d or whatever. Then what happens is two days later, you get a dozen phone calls and they\u2019ve priced it 40 percent higher and it sells in two days. Because now they\u2019re actually working for you.  Well, similarly, I went into that publishing negotiation and I was like \u2014 by the way, the agent is probably lookup-able. She\u2019s a great person. I don\u2019t think she even knows that\u2019s what was happening, you know what I mean? She was brought up in this industry for this company, and that\u2019s the way it works. She would for sure dispute everything I just said. She would say, \u201cI always try to get the highest price.\u201d But I went in and I was like, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to spend my time doing this for X. So I need four times that.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019ll ever get that. You\u2019ve never written a book before.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, we did the Alinea book.\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s cookbook. It doesn\u2019t count.\u201d These are words. So I went to the publishers that all bid on it, and I just got them all on a conference call and just started at a really high price. Every couple seconds, I went down $10,000. Then one of them blinked and bought it.  That\u2019s a great method of price discovery. If you think about it, most auctions, even if you go to a charity event or whatever, they start low and they try to get interest going high. It\u2019s often the case that if they start really high and start going down, people start going \u201cOh, my God, someone\u2019s going to say something. Like, I would pay that, someone else must as well.\u201d They could be off by a factor of 30 percent and they\u2019ll never even know it because there\u2019s only one bid that ever happens. So no one knows how off they are.  Tim Ferriss: On that phone call, were you like, \u201cHey, guys, I would love to get you on the phone,\u201d and then publisher A \u2013 [Crosstalk] Nick Kokonas: \u2013 right away.  Tim Ferriss: I guess my question is, did they know that they were signing up for a Mexican standoff? Nick Kokonas: Yes, they did. Tim Ferriss: Oh, they did. Nick Kokonas: I went and met with them all personally.  Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re like, \u201cJohn, I\u2019d love to get you on the phone\u201d then it\u2019s like, \u201cAll right, congratulations, guys.\u201d  Nick Kokonas: No, you can\u2019t ambush people to a Mexican standoff. You can\u2019t do that. You could. It might be fun, but I didn\u2019t do that. I went and talked. I created enticement. I sold on my ability to actually do it. It was a bit like doing the no phones with the software. I was like, well, if I get a really big contract, I\u2019ll have to figure out how to write a book, and then there will be a lot of pressure. So I did that and I wrote it and I turned it on time, which apparently no one does.  Tim Ferriss: Very rare.  Nick Kokonas: I sent it to them on the day it was due. They went, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I went, \u201cThat\u2019s the manuscript.\u201d They went, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cute.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s kind of like showing up at the restaurant on time as a diner and then being seated at the appointed time.  Nick Kokonas: Apparently very rare. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s just this open line.  Nick Kokonas: Do you turn your books in on time? Tim Ferriss: I do, actually.  Nick Kokonas: I believe that. Tim Ferriss: I do turn my books in on time and we could get into that a separate time.  Nick Kokonas: I just wanted to ask you a question.  Tim Ferriss: I do. I do not turn them in at the expected length. But I do \u2013 Nick Kokonas: A little longer perhaps.  Tim Ferriss: I do tend to turn them in on time.  Nick Kokonas: I do believe that. What happened with The Aviary is we basically couldn\u2019t figure out how to do another book, because the Alinea book was such a project, and Martin was on to other things. We didn\u2019t want to do it traditionally. I didn\u2019t know anyone who could do what we wanted to do. Then there was this guy, Allen Hemberger. If you get nothing else from this whole talk and you\u2019ve made it this far, go Google Allen and Alinea. Allen is a procedural effects artist. He worked at Weta Studios on all the Hobbit movies doing things like hair and water and things like that. He writes the physics that then makes the magic. He worked at Pixar.  While he was at Pixar, and his wife, Sarah, worked an Industrial Light and Magic as the graphics designer, he was given by Sarah a copy of the Alinea book, to go full circle. He became fascinated with it. He was not a cook. He didn\u2019t know how to cook. He did the Julie & Julia thing. He spent five years not only cooking his way through the entire book, but also would do things like \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know where to get this plate, and I\u2019ve always wanted to learn how to fire porcelain.\u201d  Tim Ferriss: Allen, for people wondering, is A-L-L-E-N. There are also videos of Allen and Alinea. He\u2019s an autodidact. This guy learns and learns and learns. He is the kind of person that goes to the black box and goes, \u201cI\u2019m going to learn how to forge knives, and I\u2019m going to learn how to fire porcelain. By the way, I\u2019m going to cook everything in there and I\u2019m going to make pictures of it, and I\u2019m going to make a book documenting that.\u201d When he asked if he could use \u2013 we had a little email relationship, and he came up to Alinea once to ask Grant some questions about how to make something because it wasn\u2019t working. When Grant threw up his arms and goes, \u201cWell, the book might be wrong,\u201d Allen\u2019s world view was shattered. He was like, \u201cWhat do you mean it could be wrong?\u201d He goes, \u201cWell, we did have some errata in there. We documented hundreds of recipes. It could be wrong.\u201d  At that point, his mentality changed. It\u2019s in the video. We got to know him and I got to know him. When he sent me the book, it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. I was expecting a homegrown book. What I got was a 400-page, beautifully illustrated, beautifully written book about a person\u2019s journey of learning. It was called The Alinea Project. I had no idea that he had done anything like this. Suddenly, I thought to myself immediately, and it\u2019s in the intro to The Aviary book, I texted him and said, \u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d And I have ideas. After waiting for like four or five years to do a book on The Aviary, I immediately was like, \u201cThis is the guy to do the book. Now I need to lure him out of Pixar,\u201d which is about the best place to work in the world. Then I found out his wife worked at Industrial Light and Magic and she did all the graphic design. I was like, \u201cThis is perfect. You guys need to quit your jobs and move to Chicago.\u201d  They flew out. We had some conversations about what that might look like. It was very much a partnership. They would have equity in the book. We would have creative freedom to do it exactly the way we wanted. We knew more about the printing and the bidding and all that, so I wasn\u2019t worried about the economics of it anymore. I was worried about trying to make something really awesome. Right as they were about to say yes, they found out that they were going to have a baby. So they called me up one day and said, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, they got cold feet.\u201d Oh, no. They said, \u201cWe\u2019re pregnant. We\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re going to wait a year, because there\u2019s no way in the world I\u2019m letting you move out of your comfort zone, and have a child, and have that change of life.\u201d  They thought I was punting on them just because \u2014 in a discriminatory way. I said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do this with anyone else. We will wait as long as it takes.\u201d About a year and a half later, they moved to Chicago. We spent the last year and a half, set up a studio of our own. Spent the last year and a half doing this book. Did a Kickstarter to just essentially raise awareness for it. We raised almost a half million dollars in the Kickstarter. We\u2019ve sold about another $300,000 of books since then. It comes out in October. You can go to thealineabook.com. The coolest part of that website is that if you look at \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s thealineabook? Nick Kokonas: I\u2019ll show you. Theaviarybook.com. \u201cBury the lede, Nick, bury the lede.\u201d Genius marketing right there. Yeah, theaviarybook.com. But the coolest part of that is, other than your ability to buy said book, is Allen kept a blog on there called Our Progress. In it, he details every single aspect of what it takes to make a book like this. Right down to line screens and compositing photos. One of the things that every single book publisher told me is that you can\u2019t sell a cocktail book for more than $30. There\u2019s no market for it. And you don\u2019t need pictures, because it\u2019s just liquid in a glass. I think we blew that out of the water with what the book looks like.  I think that because certain things like fire are really hard to photograph, there\u2019s this great picture in there of this one cocktail where we spray some anise and we light it on fire and it creates an aroma into the bowl that it\u2019s served it. It\u2019s called \u201cloaded to the gun walls.\u201d It\u2019s a Batavia rock cocktail. That took a composite of 18 different photographs. So he breaks down the photography techniques. Also, The New York Times Best Seller list. I showed him how Google target marketing works and Facebook ads work and all that. All of a sudden, he went, \u201cHoly shit, I had no idea you could do this.\u201d We are going completely without a distributor or a publisher at this time. I think we\u2019re going to set a, man, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m either completely delusional. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we sold a half million of these in the next two or three years.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it\u2019s not a $9.95 book either, which it shouldn\u2019t be.  Nick Kokonas: No, it\u2019s $85. We\u2019ve invested close to a million, all the way in, around it. It looks like, I think, I hope.  Tim Ferriss: From what I\u2019ve seen, it looks like it would cost more than that.  Nick Kokonas: We did it all ourselves, too. It\u2019s really like a five-person project. It\u2019s deep enough that if a professional gets it, they\u2019re going to learn a lot. But I\u2019d say about 35 to 40 percent of it can be done at home because unlike the Alinea book where you\u2019ve got to go out and buy duck and your local grocery might not have this kind of duck or whatever, if you need some Flor de Cana rum or a certain kind of tequila or whatever, you just go to your local liquor store, and it\u2019s exactly the same thing that we use. That product is universal.  Tim Ferriss: I read somewhere \u2013 I don\u2019t think this is taking us too far afield \u2013 I read somewhere that you consider yourself a tequila guy. Or at least in part a tequila guy. Do you have any favorite tequilas or concoctions?  Nick Kokonas: I\u2019m going to do a little video promo for the book that we just filmed last week, where essentially I work with Eric Jeffus, who\u2019s one of our bartenders in the office, which is our little speakeasy below The Aviary.  Tim Ferriss: Which is amazing. If people have the opportunity, they should check it out. Nick Kokonas: It\u2019s basically Grant just said, \u201cHey, everything upstairs, people are going to think it\u2019s Alinea smoke-and-mirrors. We need to prove we can make a real cocktail.\u201d So one of the foundational cocktails for me is a daiquiri. It\u2019s three ingredients and a million ways to fuck it up. It\u2019s just lime, sugar, and rum. That\u2019s all it is. And yet most bars you go into will make a terrible daiquiri. Or they\u2019ll blend it or blah, blah, blah. But a great daiquiri is really, really transformative. So I did a video on that. Then I always make a mezcal margarita. That\u2019s my favorite drink. All I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m taking some reposado and a little bit of mezcal in equal weights, along with some Grand Marnier or Cointreau equivalent, and lime and simple syrup. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all there is to it. Man, I love simple stuff like that.  Then we have a whole section in the book on old whiskeys, dusty bottles, old gins. There\u2019s a growing movement to rediscover some of the distilleries in America that were really, really great that don\u2019t exist anymore, that were more artisanal at the time. You can still find those bottles around. It\u2019s a little bit easier than someone wine collecting or something like that. Man, it\u2019s like an endlessly fascinating thing. I didn\u2019t consider myself a cocktail person 10 years ago. I really loved wine. I felt like from a health perspective it was better as well.  But just like anything else, if you have a well-constructed cocktail, something of high quality, it\u2019s an additive thing. You can have it in a meal, and it can make the meal better. Whereas a vodka tonic is just boozing. It\u2019s just getting drunk. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re trying to do here. We\u2019re trying to make things that are \u2013 it\u2019s really a culinary approach to cocktails. Man, it\u2019s endlessly fascinating, just like anything else in this world.  Tim Ferriss: I would also say, just contrasting say someone who wants to recreate something from Alinea, which you certainly could do, I mean, Allen proved that, with something from The Aviary, there is also a tremendous amount of theater and presentation dynamism that you can create with cocktails that does not have to be super expensive or super complicated, that certainly you guys are able to go as complex as you want to go, which is stunning, and I\u2019ve spent time at The Aviary.  Nick Kokonas: You could easily make some ice with Peychaud\u2019s Bitters in it or something like that, then as the ice melts in the cocktail, and it\u2019s going to look really cool, too. Doing some of these things at home is not hard. I did a dinner party once where it was like a cocktail party. I probably had 40 people at my house. Each room in my house had all of the ingredients for the cocktail, and then little instructions on how to make it themselves. That took away the need for a bartender, because they\u2019re terrible anyway, anyone that you bring in, a caterer or something like that. The other cool thing is that people got really into it. They went, \u201cOh, now I know how to make an Old Fashioned. Now I know how to make a Manhattan.\u201d The one that I discovered at that party was a Frisco Sour. I had like Benedictine, whiskey, and lemon. It was really delicious. It can be more than just a strong cocktail. It can be really delicate and interesting.  Tim Ferriss: People can learn all about this at theaviarybook.com. Is that right? Nick Kokonas: That\u2019s right, yeah.  Tim Ferriss: Well, Nick, I have two rapid fire questions that are unrelated, and then I think we\u2019re going to bring this neat and tidy round 1 podcast to a close, but we\u2019ve talked about books. Everybody should not only check out The Aviary book, but also, if they have a chance, go to The Aviary. It is tremendous. You can also get some delicious bites and food, at least the last time I was there \u2013 Nick Kokonas: You still can.  Tim Ferriss: \u2013 at The Aviary. I hesitate to call it a workaround, but you guys have some very popular establishments. If you want to sample the food, this is also a great way to do it. The drinks are just incredible. It\u2019s a real destination that makes a trip to Chicago worth it in and of itself. I would recommend not only checking out the book, but also checking out a lot of what you guys are up to. Aside from that, books you have gifted the most to other people? Outside of those that you have made yourself, what are the books that you have gifted the most to other people?  Nick Kokonas: I named one of them already. Fooled by Randomness. Almost everyone in my office is forced to read that. I\u2019ve definitely given that away. Boy, that\u2019s a tricky one because just like I said, I can\u2019t remember books very well. But certainly probably No. 1 on a business side of things. On the other side, I tend to give away what I would call vintage art books. So, it\u2019s not a book people can buy, I\u2019m sorry to say, but occasionally I\u2019ll be at a used book store and I\u2019ll find some of these great old art books. I buy a few of them and then when I want to thank someone for something, I send them that.  Tim Ferriss: Peregrinations of an Epicurean. Something like that?  Nick Kokonas: At the end of the day, when I want to give someone something, I try to make it something that, and I really want to make it a great gift, I try to get something that you can\u2019t buy. So I bought an old typewriter, and when I write a thank you note, I type it up on the old typewriter. It is the most confounding thing to people. Because they look at it and they go, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d I go, \u201cOn a 1922 typewriter.\u201d It\u2019s like a personal, artisanal thing. I know that\u2019s not what you\u2019re getting at. I can\u2019t think of the number one. I\u2019m sure once we end this, I\u2019ll immediately think of it. If I do, I\u2019ll send it to you so you can link to it.  Tim Ferriss: I think the answer is more interesting with the typewriter. I think what I\u2019m getting at is whatever \u00a0you just offered. That\u2019s perfect. If you come up with anything else, we can put it in the show notes. This next one can be tough at times for folks. So the billboard question. So, metaphorically speaking, non-commercial, no advertising, but if you could get a word, a quote, a sentence, a question, up on a billboard to transmit something to millions or billions of people, does anything come to mind that you might put on that billboard? Nick Kokonas: I don\u2019t know why this came to mind, but the word would be \u201cPause.\u201d That\u2019s it. I have no idea why that came to mind. I think in talking through this whole thing, you kept asking me: \u201cWhy are you digging this black box\u201d or whatever? Or it would be like curiosity. I thinking of those in the same way. I\u2019m not saying \u201cPause\u201d like \u201cStop.\u201d I\u2019m saying \u201cthink.\u201d I think the hallmark of the people that I like as friends the best is what we try to instill in our kids, and the reason that I like my wife so much and all that, is that intellectual curiosity is everything. I don\u2019t know, how do you get that on a billboard? I think \u201cPause\u201d or \u201cBe curious\u201d or something like that. I know it\u2019s clich\u00e9. I think that\u2019s the thread that ties everything together.  Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You do pause a lot. Even though on a macro level you seem to be moving at hyperspeed a lot of the time, there are a lot of pauses built into that speed, if that makes sense from what I\u2019ve noticed. You are simultaneously one of the craziest fuckers I have know, and least craziest fuckers I know, if that makes \u2013 Nick Kokonas: Well that\u2019s a great compliment. Thank you. I\u2019ll take it.  Tim Ferriss: Where can people find you? I know you have, of course, thealineagroup.com. You have exploretock.com. Theaviarybook.com, which is sort of the most timely for people to check out right now. If people want to say hello or follow you on social, where are the best places, the best handles for that? Nick Kokonas: Instagram, which is @nkokonas, K-O-K-O-N-A-S. And Twitter is @nickkokonas, N-I-C-K. Hey it\u2019s all Google-able. If you can figure out my email address, I\u2019ll probably answer. Although, given the reach of your podcast, perhaps I will be inundated; it might take a while. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that might be a hug of death situation. But we will TBD. Nick Kokonas: That\u2019s okay. Good problem to have, I suppose. Tim Ferriss: Good problem to have. Nick, this was a blast. Thank you so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it.  Nick Kokonas: Thank you, Tim.  Tim Ferriss: Many more conversations to be had. I think another trip to Chicago may be in order soon.  Nick Kokonas: I was going to say, I hope we see you here soon.  Tim Ferriss: I know. I need to get back. To everybody listening, we\u2019ve made mention of the show notes, links to everything we\u2019ve discussed, which you will be able to find at tim.blog/podcast, as with this episode and certainly every other episode.

of caffeine by you", "you were also of great help with the 4-hour chef", "so i wanted to, right off the bat, thank you for that", "it was a lovely experience", "nick kokonas: it was kind of a fun thing, because i remember when you sent me out a preview of the book, and then you called me to say, \u201chey, do you want to say anything about it", "i was on a chairlift", "i was like, \u201cby the time i get off this chairlift, i will have a blurb for you.\u201d it was such pressure", " tim ferriss: which meant a lot", "pressure, i think, is the word to describe so much about you and your life\u2026 i want to say \u201ctrajectory,\u201d but i\u2019m not even sure that is the right word", "i thought a fun way to kick off the conversation would be to share with people listening some of the back-and-forth we had when we were brainstorming what a podcast might look like", "because certainly i don\u2019t think of you first and foremost as a food guy, per se", "we were having this exchange via text and then via email", "i thought i\u2019d just read one of your responses as we were swapping different ideas", "i\u2019ll probably edit for space a little bit here, but not by much", "here we go", " \u201ci\u2019m a huge believer in radical transparency in business", "i give numbers and burn bridges with big companies because i think that a lot of times, people don\u2019t ask the basic questions in publishing", "for instance, how much did that book cost to print", "how many did it sell", "oddly, those numbers are very hard to come by", "i dug from months, years ago to do the alinea book the right way", "for bars \u2013 why does a bartender wash dishes and talk to customers", "we\u2019ve redesigned the bar experience in one best bar in the world", "for restaurants \u2013 why is it the only form of entertainment that has only mutual promise to show up", "then it goes into behavioral economics", "and in parentheses, i don\u2019t even know how to pronounce this last name correctly, richard thaler or is it taylor", "nick kokonas: yeah, thaler", " tim ferriss: \u201crichard thaler is a friend and investor", "just won the nobel prize", "investing", "been beating the market for nearly 30 years", "everything (in all caps) is about asymmetric risk taking and information, and yet people\u2019s perception of risk or of what i do is that it\u2019s risky", "it is not.\u201d  in a separate exchange, when we were talking about many of the topics that you could talk about outside of restaurants, bars, and so on, even though that\u2019s been a big part of your life in recent history, many of these different experiments, explorations, portions of your career, topics that you could talk about, and then going into what you said, \u201cthey come down to a single thought really", "wherever there is opaque information that should be obvious, run to that gap.\u201d  i struggle with where to even begin with the 20 options that we have here", "but maybe you can explain to me how behavioral economics and richard thaler fit into this", "just for curiosity\u2019s sake", " nick kokonas: i\u2019ll go back to the word you used, \u201coptions.\u201d because i started out back in 1992 or 1993 studying options trading, derivatives trading", "i think there\u2019s a huge misconception about what that is because of movies, because of the big short, because of wall street, and all of that", "it\u2019s a bit like playing a game of chess for a living, or being the house at a casino, that sort of thing", "it\u2019s about taking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of decisions per day and pretending it\u2019s like a big decision tree", "any given decision is probably, if you\u2019re really good, at a 48 percent chance of being wrong", "so, you have to be really, really good at constantly being comfortable being wrong, but knowing that your overall number of decisions that you\u2019re going to be right more than you\u2019re wrong", " i know there\u2019s a big theme with a lot of the folks you have on", "they talk about success or failure, how to measure those things", "i don\u2019t look at it as success or failure with anything", "i look at it as just like, is my pattern of decisions correct", "then getting back to your actual question with professor thaler and behavioral economics", "essentially what they\u2019re looking at is decision making", "what drives people to make certain decisions", "what\u2019s rational about those decisions", "what is mostly irrational or emotional", "or what decisions do we make that people don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re making a decision", "which is often the case as well", " then, if you think about it, every single form of what we do \u2013 art, commerce, science, picking a mate, all those things \u2013 comes down to a whole bunch of decisions you make without often thinking about the decision itself", "not that you can walk around going, \u201cwhoa, i\u2019ve just made another decision.\u201d but when you are doing business, or starting a company, or publishing a book, or whatever it might be, you can be intentional about that and realize that it\u2019s going to be an iterative process", "i think that\u2019s been not only the case for me in learning how to filter things through that mindset, but when you said there isn\u2019t a trajectory, i look at everything i\u2019ve done as the same, in a way", "even though other people look at it and go, \u201cwow, you went from being a derivatives trader to owning a restaurant, that\u2019s weird.\u201d i studied philosophy in college", "people are like, \u201chow do you go from philosophy to finance?\u201d to me, it was all the same thing", " tim ferriss: that particular transition or rather, progression, i suppose, from philosophy to finance is one that you and i haven\u2019t really talked about", "that one is interesting", "i\u2019d love to explore for a second", "we\u2019re going to go into a million different nooks and crannies, but did you feel like studying philosophy undergrad was an asset that then later helped you", "or was it just an interest you explored en route to other things", " nick kokonas: i can\u2019t remotely imagine having not done that", "the way actually i did it was really interesting", "i had no intention", "when i got to college, i thought i\u2019d study political science, economics, pre-law kind of thing, something like that", "my very second week at colgate university, a wonderful professor who just passed away last year at 94 years old, a really great mentor to me, professor jerome balmuth", "he was a tenured professor at colgate for almost 60 years", "he pulled me aside", "introduction to logic 101", "he basically said, \u201cwhat are you studying here?\u201d i told him and he said, \u201cno, you\u2019re going to be a philosophy major", "i\u2019m going to teach you how to think.\u201d  he was the kind of guy \u2013 there\u2019s this great scene in a river runs through it, where the dad every time the kid writes an essay, the young fisherman kid writes an essay, and he brings it to his father to be graded, he gives it back to him and says, \u201chalf as long again.\u201d long before that movie ever came out, professor balmuth would essentially assign a paper to the class and say, \u201cit should be about 15 pages.\u201d people would be like, \u201chow long?\u201d he\u2019d say, \u201chow long is a piece of string", "it\u2019s however long it needs to be.\u201d then he would tell me, \u201cyours can\u2019t be longer than three pages.\u201d  people would be jealous", "like, \u201cwow, you only have to write three pages.\u201d if you take it seriously, that is a much, much harder thing to do", "he really trained me, as well as a number of other professors there, to be clear in thinking, succinct, to understand what logic was, to process information, and really to look for parallels in different fields and different field of thought", "man, when i got out of school, i went to law school for like a day and a half", "i had gotten into penn, like a joint j.d./ph.d", "program at penn", "as soon as i knew who the other folks were and what their desires and trajectories were, i was like, \u201cthis isn\u2019t actually a good fit for me.\u201d  i remember my future father-in-law told my now-wife, then-girlfriend, that i was in danger of becoming an intellectual bum, because i dropped out of law school before i really entered law school", "i floundered around for a little while", "but if you grow up in chicago, you end up meeting people who had this unusual lifestyle", "that was back in the days pre-internet, pre-electronic trading, pre-high-frequency trading, where there were literally people on the giant trading floor shouting at each other", "you either were attracted to the almost animalistic nature of that", "for me, it was a huge challenge, because there were people down there that had ph.d.s from mit, then there were people who were butchers that went down there with $100,000 and just kicked ass", " it wasn\u2019t about your level of education or any of the stuff i already talked about", "it was about, \u201ccan you show up every day?\u201d every day is game day", "be really disciplined and very clear-headed with chaos around you", " tim ferriss: how did you get introduced to that world", "nick kokonas: if you grow up in chicago, you know some of these guys", "some of them are flashy", "i can remember the exact moment, and i\u2019m not going to name a name here, as you\u2019ll find out why in a second, but i was walking down the street", "i was six months out of college, didn\u2019t know what i was going to do", "i was walking down the street and i bumped into a guy i knew in high school", "he wasn\u2019t the best student", "he didn\u2019t try the hardest", "i was like, \u201chey what are you doing now?\u201d he was like, \u201cwell, i\u2019m just rehabbing these homes.\u201d i thought, \u201cliterally, he\u2019s a construction worker.\u201d i was like, \u201cwhat are you doing with them?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cwell, i just bought this block", "i\u2019m turning this all over.\u201d  this is a true story", "this is so not like a good reason to do something", "but i looked at him, and i was like, \u201cwhat are you talking about?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cyeah, i skipped college", "i started as a runner on the merc, and now i own 25 condos and three townhomes and i trade.\u201d i kind of went like, \u201cwow.\u201d i don\u2019t know what \u2013 i knew a little bit about it", "i\u2019d been down on the floor before, just visiting", "i was like, \u201cthat\u2019s fascinating", "that is a truly fascinating thing.\u201d i went down and visited the floor", "i had to fake my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the wrong direction to get a job", "true story", "people lie on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time", "i\u2019m probably the only person that got rid of my degree and my academic awards and all that", " to get a clerk job on the floor, the last thing they wanted was someone with a good degree, phi beta kappa, magna cum laude, all that stuff", "i faked my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, got a $5 an hour job, and looked for a mentor", "i found a guy named frank zarino, who was at chicago research and trading, which also was founded by a philosophy major", "it\u2019s actually very common", " tim ferriss: why is that common", "nick kokonas: i wish i knew the answer", "i don\u2019t know the answer", "i do know that there\u2019s three or four of the largest trading firms in the world are run by philosophy majors", "if you look back at my class, there\u2019s a few professors in there, but there are people who make movies, there\u2019s a guy who runs an ad agency, a large ad agency", "it\u2019s a really interesting path", "it\u2019s not just dislike studying physics", "i know some great physicists who are great in whatever they do", "i think it\u2019s a similar discipline of abstract thought", "i can\u2019t think of anything worse than studying business", "it just seems like a terrible thing to study to me", " tim ferriss: is that because it\u2019s like the surface of the waves in the ocean topically", "it\u2019s just so non-transferable in a sense", "then as you go lower and lower through the slower moving layers, that\u2019s just more multidisciplinary in terms of studying the basics of how things work or how people think", " nick kokonas: yeah", "it\u2019s almost like how to do something or how to manage something, but not why to do it", "and so, if you\u2019re taught in 1992, if i went and got an mba, i would\u2019ve been taught a certain kind of management that six years later with the internet would\u2019ve gotten blown up", "so, for me, i always ask the why question", "you were mentioning the book publishing or a bar", "i just look at some things and go, \u201cwhy is that", "why does it work that way?\u201d oftentimes, the people most entrenched in a system have no idea why", "they\u2019re like the third or fourth generation of person within that system and they have no idea why a school bell rings in the morning, for example", "or why a bartender is washing the dishes", "often, i don\u2019t know the real answer, but i come up with alternative ones at least that suit my narrative, i guess", " tim ferriss: undervalued skill, by the way, in some cases", "you\u2019ve got to be careful", "but very, very, very interesting", "i want to pause here, partially because i\u2019m over-caffeinated", "i was inspired by my nostalgia related to your double espressos", "but why did the professor pull you aside", "what did that early undergrad professor in logic 101 see in you \u2013 whether he explained it or not later, i don\u2019t know \u2013 that led him to take a special interest in you", " nick kokonas: well, i think i was prepared in earnest because i was mostly terrified", "he had a reputation of being a \u2013 he was a socratic method teacher", "he was pretty harsh", "colgate was very small classes", "there was a class of 80 people, and he wanted to whittle it down to a more manageable number", "his method to do that was just to kick your ass", "i remember \u2013 he probably, as great as he was, i doubt he would survive starting out at a college campus now", "i literally saw him light fire to someone\u2019s notebook once when he was asking people examples of how to put out a fire", "this one guy was just stuttering because he was so in fear, so he just lit his notebook on fire", "and he stamped", "the kid threw it on the ground and stamped on it", "he\u2019s like, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to smother it", "sure!\u201d and he called everyone \u2013 he memorized every person\u2019s last name", "it was mr", "and ms", " i remember the specific day, he was literally back to the \u2013 this was like right out of a movie \u2013 he had his back to the class writing on a chalkboard some logic problem, symbolic logic", "the guy next to me had no shot at getting it, none", "so, he said his name and i wrote on the paper on my desk so he could see it, what the answer was", "then without missing a beat or turning around, he was like, \u201cmr", "kokonas, please do not help him", "there is no way in hell he could possibly have done that without your help.\u201d this is like two or three weeks in", "he spun around and he saw that i didn\u2019t have my book", "he said, \u201cmr", "kokonas, where\u2019s your book?\u201d i said, \u201cit\u2019s in my dorm room, professor.\u201d he said, \u201cwell, a lot of good it\u2019s doing you there.\u201d i said, \u201con the contrary, it must apparently be doing me a lot of good there.\u201d he said, \u201ci\u2019ll see you after class.\u201d  i thought i was getting kicked out", "there was a line forming to create office hours or to ask to be transferred out or whatever", "when i got to the front, he said, \u201cfollow me,\u201d and i followed him to his office", "i swear, he\u2019s running through the new england fall", "i thought i was going to get kicked out of the class", "when i closed the door, i turned around and he had his feet up on the desk", "he said, \u201cwhere are you from", "what do you want to do here?\u201d that was it", "he took me under his wing", "i was very fortunate", "i never knew \u2013 here\u2019s the amazing part", "i never knew the guy liked me until 10 years after i graduated", "then i was treated like a member of his family at his funeral 30 years later", "a really fascinating person", "a really fascinating moment in my life, where i don\u2019t know, someone saw something in me and went like, \u201ci\u2019m going to make an investment in this person.\u201d he never asked for anything back, ever", " tim ferriss: how did you not know that he liked you", "did he withhold in some way so that you wouldn\u2019t get a big head or something along those lines", "did he not want to get overly attached to you so he wouldn\u2019t express it", "nick kokonas: no, no", "i think i was 19 years old and i didn\u2019t know that the people who like you hold to a higher standard probably", "consequently, it was really, he beat the shit out of me in a good way", "you know what i mean", "it\u2019s like if you have someone who\u2019s teaching you something and they invest their team in you, and they think you have a chance of being good, they work you harder than the folks around you", "so the people that i thought he liked, he was just being nice to because he didn\u2019t think they had a chance", " tim ferriss: yeah, he didn\u2019t care; he wasn\u2019t invested", " nick kokonas: yeah", "with me, i think, he would be talking to my english professor without me even knowing and being like, \u201cthat paper sucks", "he can do a lot better than that", "give him a c on that one.\u201d i was like, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d all of a sudden, that class got hard", "i didn\u2019t know", "i had no idea", "it was an interesting, lucky, fortunate place to be at that time", " tim ferriss: we\u2019re going to get back to the merc, but before we do, philosophy \u2013 i\u2019m endlessly fascinated by philosophy, but i\u2019m also a nerd and academic and pedantic and have spent a lot of time in school", "for people who are listening to this who are already in their careers, or maybe they\u2019re in their early 20s, thinking of starting a company, but are entrepreneurially either involved or inclined, would you suggest if they don\u2019t have any exposure to philosophy that they read any particular books or resources or explore it in any way", "or would you say \u201cactually, you know what", "that was an intermediate step to something else", "you would probably be better off studying x, y, and z.\u201d is there like a starter kit or something you would recommend to folks who don\u2019t have the philosophy exposure", " nick kokonas: i think part of it is if you read a book in isolation, it\u2019s not as rich of an experience as discussing those ideas within that context", "that said, if you\u2019re the kind of person that loves to read and explore ideas, there\u2019s hardly a better place", "it\u2019s a matter of finding what you enjoy", "i happen to love the problems of philosophy, which bertrand russell wrote", "it\u2019s sort of about wittgenstein\u2019s ideas, but before wittgenstein published", "it\u2019s written in plain language", "it\u2019s not hard to understand", "certainly nietzsche is more like philosophy with some weird sugar coating of something on top of it", "man, as a young male, reading nietzsche for the first time, i was like, fuck yeah", "you know", "it\u2019s not passive", "i think people think of philosophers as zen monks sitting there quietly contemplating the universe", " i think what it is, is people grappling with all the same questions and curiosity that we all have if you pause to think about it", "it\u2019s so big that it\u2019s not just descartes, \u201ci think, therefore i am.\u201d it\u2019s every little bit of that", "read lucretius", "he read the atomic \u2013 tim ferriss: could you spell that", "i\u2019m going to be the first one to admit that i \u2013 nick kokonas: lucretius", "tim ferriss: oh, lucretius", "nick kokonas: yeah, lucretius", " tim ferriss: l-u-c-r-e-t-i-u-s", "nick kokonas: yeah, i\u2019m a terrible speller", "never ask me to spell anything", " tim ferriss: we\u2019ll put it in the show notes", "nick kokonas: read that", "or read this great book called the swerve, which is about this monk ages ago that found that book and then rewrote it and saved it for history", "it reads like a murder mystery", "you don\u2019t necessarily need to start with philosophy", "you can start with the things around it", "i continue to find the world of ideas endlessly inspirational", "then, by the way, steal them and use them in whatever you\u2019re doing", "they\u2019re there for you", " tim ferriss: lucretius", "l-u-c-r-e-t-i-u-s", "titus lucretius carus was a roman poet and philosopher", "we\u2019ll put that in the show notes", "bertrand russell, also", "i haven\u2019t read bertrand russell in so many ages, but it is very digestible", "it is not dressed up in $10 words when $0.10 words would suffice", "a lot of his writing is really powerful", "i also just wanted to mention for folks, and i just thought about this, ages and ages ago i felt like i had certain gaps in my education after college", "i ended up \u2013 i don\u2019t know why this didn\u2019t occur to me earlier, but someone mentioned that stanford, uc berkeley, these top-tier universities, all had extended or adult education classes taught by professors and junior professors", "this is the same team who is teaching", "those are very readily accessible", "nick kokonas: even mit opencourseware", "so many colleges now have taken that model and put great, great, great classes online", "i know that every now and then i\u2019m surprised at what i find on there, and get sucked into", "like an all-nighter of taking some college class that i

told me it was a fatal error", " tim ferriss: this is the law school", "nick kokonas: yeah", "i remember being down there and what i was doing was so brainless", "it was literally you take this piece of paper over to that guy, and then that guy would yell at you, and rip the paper out of your hand, and then you\u2019d go get another one", "it was literally that brain-dead", "i was desperately looking to learn what was going on around me", "of course, i bought books on finance and commodities and options and all that", "they were completely ridiculous and opaque and academic", "it looked like they had no relationship to what was going on there at all", "i started taking classes that were run at the merc on mock trading, and just learning the hand signals and things like that, which were fine but didn\u2019t really teach you how to trade", " i spent time interviewing with big companies like goldman sachs and soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale and whatnot, because i did have the

look at the contract", "this is a key thing", "people get out of college, they get offered a job", "i think i\u2019m the only one who ever read the employment contract", "what it said in there was

then, you literally would have to take the elevator up to key punch in all the cards into a computer that was up 17 floors away", "ancient times", "i met him through being introduced to him there",

no", "i will pay you to work for you.\u201d he was like, \u201cthis is really strange.\u201d  i explained to him like, \u201clook, i\u2019ve been here for six months.\u201d i set a goal for myself of

this and going deeper down that rabbit hole, the more i liked it as a puzzle", " certainly the money had an appeal, but it was also, \u201chey, here\u2019s this giant competition", "it\u2019s like playing a huge, multifaceted chess game that no one\u2019s going to get exactly right.\u201d but like i said earlier, it\u2019s about making hundreds of decisions a day", "even when you get 10 in a row that come up tails, you know that the next one is 50/50", "that discipline was interesting", "that was more about teaching yourself the psychology of standing there while everyone told you that you were wrong, or you were physically small, or you were too educated, or too serious", "you can\u2019t imagine how much of a fraternity house that place was", "everything in wolf of wall street, i have seen", "i haven\u2019t lived, but i\u2019ve seen it all", " i started hiring very shortly after i started trading", "about a year later, i left and started my own company with almost nothing", "i hired my first employee, who became my business partner for the last 25 years", "i taught him what i\u2019d learned", "i hired people that i considered corporate refugees", "people who worked for companies and decided that independence was better", " tim ferriss: why did you leave after a year", " nick kokonas: he was moving over to the chicago board of trade, and i had found a couple of awesome programmers to help build this options analysis software", "he offered me up to run some of the operations at the mercantile exchange when he went over to trade the bonds at the board of trade", "he was a really smart guy", "he made me a deal that when you analyzed it very carefully, got worse over time", "i just went, \u201cyou know, it\u2019s been great and i\u2019ve learned a ton",

was asymmetric", "far more upside than downside", "it worked out really well", "we spent most of our time as we hired people and taught them how to do this, it was mostly psychology training", "it was mostly standing around after hours and saying, what\u2019s 7 x 28", "and screaming it at each other like a drill sergeant until the person couldn\u2019t remember what 9 x 3 was anymore", " tim ferriss: wait", "why did you do that", "nick kokonas: well, you had to be quick on basic mental agility", "so, if you bought 450 contracts and it was a 20 delta, you needed to be able to do, what\u2019s 20 percent of 450", "it\u2019s 90", "but you need to do that precisely with numbers that are not so round", "you need to be willing to not be perfect, and you need to make that decision instantaneously, and realizing that it could cost you $50,000 to $100,000 if you get it right or wrong", "you have to be really comfortable with that", "what did we do", "well, we stood around and we turned people\u2019s brains into mush", "i literally had people punch me, cry, run out", "it sounds awful, but it\u2019s amazing training, because the rest of the world moves much slower", "so, any other decisions that i\u2019ve made in business since then have felt glacial in pace", " tim ferriss: there\u2019s also something to be said for making the training in some or all respects harder than the competition, right", "the adage of the more you sweat during peacetime, the less you bleed during wartime", "the best competitors i\u2019ve met in many fields often strive to make their training and the toil of their preparation harder than what they expect to face when they actually \u2013 nick kokonas: it\u2019s why we like watching big-time sports", "when it matters, there are certain people that you know \u2013 you can almost look at them and go, \u201cthat poor person is going to fade.\u201d then you hope they don\u2019t", "you hope all that training pays off", "i love golf for all the same reasons", "it\u2019s just a series of constant failures", "then when you look at someone who can pull that rabbit out of the hat at exactly the right moment, it\u2019s pretty wonderful to see", "the thing i loved about my time down there, even though i burned out of it after 10 years, is that there were moments where i did \u2013 i have friends who will listen to this and they\u2019ll be like, \u201coh, yeah, i remember that time in the sop pit", "you really got this right.\u201d but i made some completely stupid decisions", "but mostly on the measure, when things go crazy, i was able to perform more than that", " i remember greenspan\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d speech was like a formative moment where i went, \u201cwow, i can not only hang in this environment, i can thrive in it.\u201d you get home soaking wet with sweat", "it was a physical job", "it was really blue-collar in a lot of ways", "i got home that day and i was like, \u201cthat was what i prepped my last six years for.\u201d it was very satisfying", "it sounds like an awful \u2013 it is an awful thing in a way", "it\u2019s just about pure commerce", "it serves a purpose of price discovery and all that, but any individual person isn\u2019t really the one doing that", "i think that there are negatives to the whole system as well, in hindsight", "but man, at the time, it just felt like great mental training", " tim ferriss: what would you recommend to people who are listening and are having this flashback to the introductory text exchange about beating the market over a long period of time, who are hoping to become better investors", "you can take that anywhere you want", "but are there any particular tools, books, mental models, anything that you\u2019d recommend", "nick kokonas: it\u2019s really hard", "i think the mental model is asymmetric risk", "always look for something that the upside is 3-4x the downside", "obviously, quantifying those is very difficult, but that\u2019s the key", "everything is try to do is asymmetric", "then, even though nassim taleb is a bit of a pedantic goofball on twitter, his book fooled by randomness is awesome", "that was the one that preceded black swan", "i think black swan is great; it\u2019s fine", "but fooled by randomness is, i think, the better of all his books because man, it just encapsulates everything", "people price things incorrectly", " tim ferriss: it\u2019s a great book, yeah", " nick kokonas: all you have to do is walk through a casino and you see everybody pricing their outcomes incorrectly", "the entire city is built on that", "if you could get in your head \u2013 tim ferriss: literally", " nick kokonas: yeah, literally", "i don\u2019t take any pleasure", "people are like, \u201cyou must love gambling,\u201d or whatever", "it\u2019s like, i would never sit down to a blackjack table because i know that there\u2019s a 49.5 percent chance that i\u2019m going to win, and that\u2019s the wrong way", " tim ferriss: yeah", "fooled by randomness has come up a number of times", "i haven\u2019t read it in ages, because it is one of his earlier books", "howard marks also brought this up recently when i was chatting with him", "it is an exceptional book i think for developing a new lens on life, not just investing", "when you are investing for yourself now, how do you think about risk", "because this is a word that has popped up a few times", "how do you personally think about risk in your life", "for instance, some startup founders look at the risk as the various early-stage startups, restaurants, bars, and so on, that you\u2019re involved with, and then you play it safe in your other asset allocation", "how do you think about risk in your life or in investing", " nick kokonas: yeah, that\u2019s a pretty difficult question", " tim ferriss: it is, yeah", "nick kokonas: i think that if you look at everything that i\u2019ve done business-wise, everybody would say that the failure rate is super high in what we do", "so trading, they used to say, \u201cone of a hundred people that goes down there breaks even their first year", "out of that one, take another hundred of those ones and less than one in a hundred of those becomes a millionaire.\u201d i went, \u201cgreat.\u201d it\u2019s like the old jim carrey", "\u201cso you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a chance?\u201d then you go to the restaurant business", "people are like, \u201coh, yeah, 95 percent of all restaurants go out of business in their first two years.\u201d i\u2019m going, like, \u201cgreat", "that\u2019s perfect.\u201d  tim ferriss: why do you have that response", "nick kokonas: then i\u2019m doing a software startup now, too", " tim ferriss: go for it", "nick kokonas: so, the higher, the smaller the hoop, the more interesting it is to figure it out", "and once you\u2019re up there and you know how to jump up through that little hoop, there\u2019s fewer people playing that game", "the other thing is, i remember right when i was going to start building alinea with grant, i was talking to a restaurant owner", "by all accounts, he was pretty successful", "he had four to five restaurants", "one of them i really liked a lot, and we\u2019d go there a lot", "i got to know him a little bit", "he said, \u201cso what are you up to?\u201d i said, \u201cactually, i\u2019m building a restaurant now.\u201d he looked at me and he said, \u201cit\u2019s a terrible business", "you don\u2019t want to do it", "incredible failure rate; terrible.\u201d i was like, \u201cwhy did you build the next four?\u201d  tim ferriss: how did he respond to that", "nick kokonas: you know, no one does", "we\u2019ll get to it, i\u2019m sure, but that\u2019s the way i was with the publishing thing", "it\u2019s like, \u201chey man, people keep printing books, and yet i can\u2019t figure out any of the information", "and yet they\u2019re going to give me $300,000 or $400,000 to write a book", "something is remiss here.\u201d you know what i mean", "i\u2019ve never written a book before, but yet someone is going to write me a $400,000 check", "there must be a lot of money on the other side of that bet", "and so, consequently, i always try to look for the high, small hoops", "then i spend my time learning as much as i can, and then i jump through that hoop", "it\u2019s both more interesting, i think, and i also think getting back to the asymmetry of risk, those are the ones that yeah, you might have a \u2013 well, first of all, do you really have a 95 percent failure rate if you put in all that effort", "i don\u2019t think so", " second of all, i think they priced it wrong, so to speak", "then second of all, man, that\u2019s where the fun is", "that gets you up in the morning and going to work", "tim ferriss: this is where, among many other places, averages can be very misleading", "i always end up in public q&as and things of this type hearing various numbers and stats thrown around, many of which i think have no basis on any data whatsoever", "there is, \u201cwe only use 10 percent of our brains.\u201d not true", "there is the \u201cnine out of 10 startups fail within the first year,\u201d or whatever the stat is", "the first question that occurs to me with a number like the latter, or i guess a ratio is, \u201cis it because the model is difficult?\u201d is it because startups are inherently that high risk, or are there other plausible explanations", "is it that nine out of 10 people who attempt to start a startup don\u2019t do any of the necessary due diligence", " nick kokonas: i\u2019ve been on a couple of graduate school, entrepreneurship contests and whatnot", "one of the things that always happens there is what i call the time machine", "somebody comes up with a business plan that is like, \u201ci\u2019m going to build a time machine.\u201d now of course, it\u2019s not really a time machine", "but i have seen ones that defy the laws of physics, for example", "or new pipeline technology, but they have no idea", "it\u2019s just a pipe dream", "they\u2019ve done none of the engineering", "so you look at that and you go, \u201cyou haven\u2019t really done the homework yet, at all.\u201d then there\u2019s a lot of people who come to me and they\u2019ve spent six months doing their logo and the name of the company, but they don\u2019t actually have a piece of software yet", "\u201coh, i\u2019m just going to hire someone to build that for me.\u201d or an app", "i get so many apps pitched to me", "they don\u2019t know how to build an app, but they\u2019ve got a logo and an idea", "i was like, \u201cthat\u2019s a good way to blow a half million dollars on a consultant.\u201d you must get that 50 times worse than i do", " tim ferriss: what i tend to get, and this is part of the reason why i stopped all the startup stuff a couple years ago, is it got to the point where 90 percent of the pitches i received \u2013 which were unsolicited \u2013 would be along the lines of \u201chi,\u201d like not even a first name", "or it would be like, \u201chi, tim,\u201d or, \u201chey, tim!\u201d even better",

decision, is \u201cno.\u201d i\u2019ve lost very little money saying no to those things", " coming back to the examples that you were giving and what we were talking about, bridging over to restaurants and food", "so you\u2019re being told how restaurants are an awful business; food is an awful business", "i remember someone told me a long, long time ago, \u201cif you want to lose money, go into magazines or restaurants.\u201d at what point \u2013 and i have a little bit of the backstory, but not all the details \u2013 at what point do you decide to go into or get involved with restaurants, and why", " nick kokonas: i left trading in about 2002", "2001 was a tough year between 9/11, which my father had died in february of that year", "i was burnt out after going really hard for so long", "we\u2019d built up a pretty good size company", "i\u2019d merged with a firm in new york", "i needed a break, but didn\u2019t know how to really take one at the time", "so i left trading", "i immediately panicked, because here was something i really, genuinely enjoyed", "but i didn\u2019t know what i wanted to do next", "i started doing consulting for a small hedge fund",

and can play golf on a wednesday afternoon", "it was just a weird thing", "i looked at them and they didn\u2019t seem all that happy, even though they\u2019ve got this lifestyle", " i met grant achatz, the chef, while dining at trio", "i went to a lunch there afternoon that some friends set up", "it was a transformative experience", "it was artistic", "it was intellectual", "it was thought-provoking", "most of all, it was emotional", "those are all things that i would never have associated with eating a dinner", "from a perspective of great art experiences, like seeing a great movie or a great play, or going to an amazing museum opening, we kept getting drawn back there", "we kept going back", "we would go back so frequently that it was absurd", "because it was a big meal and it wasn\u2019t cheap", "every time we\u2019d go somewhere else, we\u2019d go like, \u201cwow, why is no one else thinking this way?\u201d  as i got to know grant a little bit, i think sometimes people bring the chef some wine or beer or whatever", "that\u2019s kind of sand to the beach", "i would bring him books", "i didn\u2019t figure he had a lot of time to read", "i would put a post-it note on a page of an old book", "i remember i brought him this book called the peregrinations of an epicure", "tim ferriss: hold on a second", "the peregrinations \u2013 like a peregrine falcon", "i don\u2019t even know what that is", " nick kokonas: no, no, a peregrination is like a wondering about", "so, it was written just after world war ii by an ex-serviceman", "he goes around paris, i want to say maybe late \u201840s, early \u201850s", "i can\u2019t recall exactly", "there is a chapter in there on la pyramide, the best in the world at the time", "he described a meal there in emotional terms that resonated with what grant was doing, even though his technique, his cuisine, everything was completely different", "i would literally highlight a couple lines in there and give him this book, which was out of print at the time", "we developed this email relationship back and forth, where he would try out some new food on us, and i would give direct, honest feedback", "but not, \u201coh, it was delicious!\u201d it was more like, \u201cyou\u2019re going for a provocation there.\u201d we would go back and forth", " he wrote at the time on a forum called egullet", "i went on there and his spelling and grammar notwithstanding, it was like reading someone who\u2019s really thinking hard about what they\u2019re doing", "everything we just talked about, here was this young, 28-year-old chef from michigan who looked like captain america", "he was like hollywood in the sense that he was good-looking and very driven, very clean-cut", "but he didn\u2019t look like the stereotype, central casting of a chef, chubby gregarious guy", "he was really quiet and introspective, shy", "but then you read these, which are still up", "you can still google it", "he\u2019d go on for like four pages about bread service", "like, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of bread?\u201d this is a guy that i could wrap my head around", " i remember on january 20, 2004, my wife\u2019s

him and said, \u201cshe\u2019s ethnically latvian, speaks japanese, and loves thai food", "good fucking luck.\u201d i knew exactly what that would do to him", "that would put him into 10 days of pure hell, because he would research latvian food", "he would redo a whole menu", "20 courses, right", "i didn\u2019t know they were going to put us in the kitchen", "they put us in the kitchen", "it sounds like a jerky thing to do now, but we did have a relationship a little bit at the time", " he served us the most amazing meal of my life", "it started out with latvian sorrel soup with braised ham hocks", "it had flavors of the sea, which was a japanese dish", "it had thai dishes, but it was all in his style", "so, it was his own, and yet it had elements of all these things", "at the end of that meal, he said to me, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d i had watched the kitchen", "it was like a watchmaker\u2019s shop", "it was not screaming and yelling", " tim ferriss: sorry to interrupt", "it is so unlike anything that the vast majority of people listening to this would possibly expect, right", " nick kokonas: it\u2019s not gordon ramsay", "tim ferriss: it is complete silence", "it is like a watchmaking factory", "it is really something else", "anyway, sorry to jump in", " nick kokonas: no, no, that\u2019s totally fine", "at the end, i said, \u201ci doubt anybody anywhere in the world

with us", "i said, \u201cwhat are you going to do?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d i said, \u201cwell, you\u2019re not going to be here forever.\u201d he said, \u201cwell, i want to build my own restaurant.\u201d i said, \u201ci\u2019d be happy to help you do that.\u201d he said, \u201cwell, what kind of restaurant do you want to build?\u201d i said, \u201ci don\u2019t know,

\u2013 nick kokonas: completely nuts", "we didn\u2019t even know each other", " tim ferriss: i mean, can you put that in perspective for people", "i actually did not realize that was the timeframe", " nick kokonas: yeah", " tim ferriss: can you, just in the context of normal restaurant world", "nick kokonas: we argued", "we didn\u2019t really know each other very well, but he would come by my house and he didn\u2019t \u2013 tim ferriss: let me interject for a second, because you\u2019ve said \u201cwe didn\u2019t know each other very well.\u201d what did you know about each other, nonetheless, that gave you guys the push, the impulse, and the sufficient level of trust/excitement to actually pursue it", "there had to be something there", "it couldn\u2019t just be nothing", "so what was it", "you didn\u2019t know each other well", "i mean, maybe you didn\u2019t know the full scope of each other\u2019s backgrounds", " nick kokonas: i actually studied that", "that i actually knew", "i knew the facts", "i knew what he was putting in front of me", "but i didn\u2019t know him the way you\u2019d know someone that you were going to become a business partner with", "i think he just thought i was rich", "i\u2019m being serious", "like i think everyone else wanted \u2013 this is really true because he has said this to me", "everyone else wanted to offer him a restaurant that they had already built or wanted to build", "i actually answered that question correctly", "the \u201ci don\u2019t know\u201d is an awesome thing to say 90 percent of the time of your life", "when he said, \u201cwhat kind of restaurant do you want to build,\u201d i could have waxed on about some dream i had or just made some bullshit up at the time, but i just said, \u201ci have no idea", "that\u2019s a big question", "we need to sort that out.\u201d  i think that was the right answer for him", "i think that\u2019s all he needed to know was, \u201cokay, the guy\u2019s got an open mind", "he seems to have done well in business", "he knows apparently how to build something.\u201d what was really funny was the stuff that i was concerned about, which was like architecture, design, plumbing, building, lease, all of that, he was like, the word \u201coblivious\u201d is not too strong a word", "\u00a0this is not a criticism of him either, right", "it\u2019s just like he came to my house and was like, \u201cyeah, i want martin to design everything.\u201d martin kastner, who is a genius designer, has crucial detail, which we\u2019ve been involved with for 15 years now", "he\u2019s a designer", "he\u2019s an artisan", "he built plateware and he won the bocuse d\u2019or for the platter he designed from thomas keller and daniel boulud\u2019s team for team usa and all that", "but back then, this guy\u2019s not going to design plumbing or electrical", " i would just look at this guy and go, \u201cno, he can\u2019t", "we need an architect and you need to get city stamps and all that.\u201d i think grant was just like, \u201cyeah, you find a place, you put tables in it, you build a kitchen, and you go.\u201d in terms of \u2013 obviously he knew there were health inspectors and all that", "but the process of all this just about \u2013 either we\u2019re not going to build it ever eight weeks in because we would\u2019ve hated each other, or we were the kind of people that figured everything out", "we just talked it out", "right down to what kind of tables", "what kind of glassware", "what kind of this", "we wanted to rethink the why again of everything", "\u201cwhy do you put a candle on a table", "why is a candle romantic?\u201d that\u2019s a question we asked", "\u201cwhy do we need candles", "why is that romantic", "why do people put a little bud vase on the table", "why shouldn\u2019t that be an edible thing", "that\u2019d be cool.\u201d  so, we did all of that", "we designed the experience to create emotional responses from the moment that you walked in the front door", "we didn\u2019t have the podium", "we went, \u201cwhat does a good greeting feel like?\u201d not just \u201cif you\u2019re at someone\u2019s house, what does that feel like", "if you\u2019re at a restaurant, what shouldn\u2019t it feel like?\u201d well, it shouldn\u2019t feel like a computer in front of your face saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d and all of that", "we went through every aspect of that", "i lost almost 20 pounds that year", "not in a healthy way", "just gcing the construction", "i laid tile in the basement like three days before we opened", "tim ferriss: let me pause for one second", "so the why question that comes to mind for me is, after the finance, after battling it out on the front lines and going through 2001, why this as your next thing", "why is this the thing that captured your imagination", "you had to know on some level, once you started getting into the details, like, \u201cfuck, this is going to be\u201d \u2013 nick kokonas: it\u2019s all in, yeah", " tim ferriss: \u201cthis is going to be all my chips, energetically.\u201d so why this", "nick kokonas: you know, there are occasional times when you wake up in the morning and that thought comes back to you", "that like, \u201chey, i\u2019m really sucked into this.\u201d for about three or four months, without telling anybody, even dagmara, not telling her, telling no one, i kept going, \u201ci should build a restaurant with this guy", "like, it would be the best restaurant in the world if it was done all the way.\u201d i recognized my inner voice saying, \u201cthat\u2019s a really dumb idea", "you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d i\u2019d never worked a day in my life in a restaurant", "i also recognized, and this is also critical, i recognized that so many people built their living room after they made some money", "they went, \u201coh, i know how to host a good dinner party", "i know good wine, so i\u2019m going to build me a restaurant.\u201d then they sit there like it\u2019s their living room", "that\u2019s not good", " i didn\u2019t want to be that deucy guy that built a restaurant because my ego needed to host a party", "whenever i would later on broach that subject and people would say, \u201cwell\u2026\u201d and i could almost hear their brain whispering, \u201cwell, of course that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d that was, again, not the best of motivations in the world, perhaps, but the honest one", "that was hugely motivating eventually", "when we first started, it was this nagging thing like i\u2019d wake up in the morning and i\u2019d go, \u201cyou know, i\u2019m not really into what i\u2019m doing right now", "i\u2019ve just met somebody who\u2019s the best in the world at what they do, and no one knows it yet.\u201d that\u2019s probably happened to me \u2013 i\u2019m really fortunate, but that\u2019s probably happened to me seven or eight times in my life", " when it happens and i meet that person, whoever it might be, no matter what they\u2019re doing, i pause", "i kind of acknowledge that directly", "then i just go like, \u201ccan we grab a glass of wine or coffee or something?\u201d that\u2019s something worth marking and going, \u201cwow, this person\u2019s really invested in something.\u201d grant had every aspect of being that at 28 years old", "in hindsight, it looks smart, but i\u2019ve got to tell you, it was years before it felt smart", " tim ferriss: you mentioned just now that you\u2019ve met these people seven or eight times who are the best in the world or potentially the best in the world", "nick kokonas: well, among them, yeah", " tim ferriss: among them", "but the key point that jumps out for me is: \u201c\u2026and the world didn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d so my question for you is, that sort of brings to the forefront in my mind at least, the question of, \u201cwhat is nick seeing or feeling that other people are not?\u201d could you talk to that", "is there a feeling or a particular type of observation, a particular type of detail that you notice in these people that allows you to scout the talent where other people might miss it or not pay enough attention to it", " nick kokonas: i think you\u2019ve written a couple books about that", "it\u2019s definitely intangible", "i think it\u2019s different in every case", "it\u2019s interesting because you can tell when someone is fully committed, i guess, to their craft, or their art, or their business, or whatever it is that they\u2019re doing, their sport", "it\u2019s not be they talk about it all the time, although if you push a little, they\u2019re happy to do so", "but it\u2019s more like if you look around, the vast majority of people are not fully committed to whatever, you know", "i think part of what you do is you try to steer people to find those things that they can commit to", "or you can try to lower a barrier to show them the commitment is not as hard as you think in this particular area, right", "tim ferriss: right", "nick kokonas: but these folks are all in", "they\u2019re 99 percent in", "that\u2019s what they do", "often to the detriment, frankly, of other aspects of their lives", "i guess you get better at noticing them", "now i live for that", "i love meeting people that even if it\u2019s not something i\u2019m interested in, that are all in", "that\u2019s an interesting \u2013 really, i\u2019ve never really thought about it that way", "it was just very clear to me that grant was all in", "here\u2019s the thing", "if he wasn\u2019t going to do it with me, he was still going to do it", "i was a helper", "over time, i certainly contributed a great deal to it", "he contributed a great deal to the business, and i also contributed to the art, but that took time", "but i could tell that he was all in", "that was fun", "it\u2019s fun to work with somebody who is basically like, \u201cokay, man, if you\u2019re not in, get out of the way, because i\u2019m still going.\u201d  tim ferriss: for anyone who has the opportunity, i don\u2019t even know if they would have the opportunity, but to watch, observe grant for even 60 seconds", " nick kokonas: well, chef\u2019s table on netflix is great", " tim ferriss: yeah, chef\u2019s table", "great, perfect", "everybody should have the experience of observing grant working and focusing", "i\u2019ve met a lot of people who are good at focusing who have abnormal focusing abilities", "spending the time that we did together in chicago, and the time that i had to observe grant, it is a next level of focus", "it\u2019s really hard to encapsulate in words", "so, chef\u2019s table, fantastic", "people should check it out, and just watch the level of focus that permeates the appearance, the air, the atmosphere", "it\u2019s really something else", "to that point, focus", "one of my favorite aspects of speaking with you and having conversations is the questions that you raised", "candles", "not just, \u201cshould we have candles?\u201d that\u2019s maybe a good question, but it\u2019s probably not the right first question", "why do restaurants use candles in the first place", "furthermore, why are candles considered romantic", "stepping back", " nick kokonas: basic stuff, yeah", "tim ferriss: what are other questions that you asked related to alinea", "or you could certainly bridge to other, i think it makes sense to chat about aviary as well", "but what are some other questions that you guys asked that people might not think to ask", " nick kokonas: grant set the tone for that in our first meeting, not really knowing me", "we started talking", "we didn\u2019t even know where to start, right", "he said, \u201cwell, i know one thing", "i want to have wooden tables", "i want to have bare wood tables.\u201d i said, \u201cwhy?\u201d he said, \u201cwell why do fancy restaurants have white tablecloths", "they literally call it a white tablecloth restaurant if it\u2019s fancy", "why?\u201d i couldn\u2019t really \u2013 i came up with dumb answers", "\u201cit feels good", "it absorbs a spill,\u201d or whatever it may be", "he said, \u201cno, it\u2019s because the table underneath is a piece of shit.\u201d he goes, \u201cand you know that", "as soon as you say it, everyone goes, \u2018oh, yeah, i knew that.\u2019 you\u2019ve been at weddings and stuff where you feel under the table and you\u2019re like, \u2018oh, it\u2019s plywood.\u2019 but if you go to a really fancy restaurant and you feel under the table, guess what", "also plywood, just a little thicker.\u201d  he\u2019s like, \u201cwhen you rest your arms on the table, even if it doesn\u2019t come forefront in your mind, you subconsciously know that they\u2019re fooling you.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we have black, beautiful tables", "it\u2019ll show the food great", "it\u2019ll show the plateware great.\u201d then i went like, \u201cwell, yeah, but the health department in chicago doesn\u2019t let you put silverware right on the table.\u201d if you put a glass there, the condensation will form a little ring, and then you have a wear issue", "but you\u2019ll save $70,000 a year in laundering linens", "we started going, \u201cwell how do we solve the water problem", "well, you create a fridge that\u2019s just above the dew point, 44 degrees in the winter, maybe a little warmer in the summer because it\u2019s higher humidity in chicago, and you just get rid of ice.\u201d  you have these cascading decisions that become part of the art of the place", "some of them start from a really practical thing like, \u201chey, we want to have a quality table.\u201d then all of a sudden you need a little pillow that the silverware goes on that martin designed, because we didn\u2019t want to have placemats; that\u2019s too cheap", "all of a sudden, we had to design a silverware holder", "it just became this cascade of interesting little art projects that were there for good reasons, and really created a unique atmosphere", "it was one of those things like we never tested until the day we opened", "you couldn\u2019t test those things", "the very first guy through the door is now a famous chef, chef sean brock of husk", " tim ferriss: yeah, he\u2019s fantastic", " nick kokonas: he was not yet a chef then, 2005", "he was the first guy through the door", "he wrote this giant blog post on egullet with pictures and everything", "you can go see it", "every single thing that we hoped would create an emotional trigger, an emotional reaction, it\u2019s almost all there", "i remember going home and seeing that the next day and going, \u201cwow", "that shit actually worked!\u201d right down to the front hallway that was a reverse perspective, stolen from chartres cathedral and inverted", "all of my interest in architecture, and art, and science, and all of grant\u2019s food, and all that, all came together in a year-long conversation on how to do something", " we really fought with the architect and designers and all that because people would tell us the practical reasons why you needed to do this or that", "we would just go no, no host stand", "we wanted to greet people in an open way", "just little things like that", "then we\u2019ve taken that on through everything that we\u2019ve done, where we took six or seven years to build our next place because we didn\u2019t have that idea that kept us up at night again", "when we did, then we did it", "i think editing yourself and each other in an open way is really painful, but really important", " tim ferriss: coming back to something you mentioned related to the living room", "the well-off, who then creates say an art project that is not \u2013 it may be beautiful, but is most often not a viable business", "how did you apply those questions, and rethink the business model to make any of this work financially", "nick kokonas: you don\u2019t want to be a dilettante, right", "and so, my biggest fear is that it would work in an artistic way, but wouldn\u2019t work as a business", "so, the answer is, at the beginning, i didn\u2019t do much", "i handled all of our marketing and pr", "i wrote everything myself", "i really thought about open-sourcing the building of the restaurant", "you can still go online and see the original business plans and logos we were considering using, and the test kitchen, which was in my house", "we didn\u2019t tell anyone at the time, but that was my house at the time", "and see the development of this restaurant", " i felt like the open-source movement in that way was a good model for what we were trying to accomplish", "part of that was people would say a restaurant like this can\u2019t make money", "i wrote this little spreadsheet that i called the universal restaurant calculator", " tim ferriss: can people find that online", "nick kokonas: no, no, no", "it would be very unimpressive if they could", "but it was basically how many covers per night \u2013 this is back-of-the-envelope stuff \u2013 how many covers per night can you do", "what\u2019s the check average for food", "check average for beverage", "what are your food costs, beverage costs, labor costs", "what does insurance cost", "your lease, your rent", "all those things", "i had enough experience with most of those things to at least give good estimates to it", "so what i started doing is i started modeling other restaurants using the universal restaurant calculator", "i had, again, this goes to the transparency of data", "i had real data for only two restaurants", "from those two, i would then make assumptions about restaurants like the french laundry, where grant used to work, one of the greatest restaurants in the history of america, certainly", " i came up with a number that grant went, \u201cthere\u2019s no way their revenue is that high or they make that much money", "that\u2019s impossible.\u201d it\u2019s really funny because years later, i now work with chef keller, and he\u2019s a friend all these years later", "i literally pulled that out with grant one day being there and went like, \u201chow close am i back on this in 2005?\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201coh, you were within 2 or 3 percent", "grant was just like \u2013 we\u2019re talking about back-of-the-envelope stuff", "so you asked where can people start to start a business", "start on the back of an envelope", "one of my favorite exercises is to sit in a restaurant or a small business of some sort and just literally do the back of the envelope", " it was the kind of the calculation my dad called the two-shoebox method; put me through college", "money coming in one shoebox, money going out in the other", "whatever\u2019s left is profit", "start that basic", "we did that", "i didn\u2019t really think about the \u2013 we did well, but we didn\u2019t make a ton of money", "alinea cost $2.2 million to build", "i put up a little over a quarter of that myself and found investors for the rest, all of whom i knew", "in the first year, we made about $450,000 to $500,000 on $4 or $5 million in sales", "not a great return", "not a terrible return", "we then won best restaurant in america from gourmet magazine", "i was horrified that we won that, frankly", " i remember grant called me and said, \u201ci just got a call from ruth reichl.\u201d we had some stated goals of how we would know if this was a success", "one of the things we wrote down was, \u201cruth reichl declares it the best restaurant in america.\u201d we wrote that because in 1997, she wrote, \u201cthe most exciting place to eat in america is the french laundry.\u201d grant was there and cooked that meal and said that the energy of having someone he respected so much \u2014 because ruth is just a great writer; she is one of the unimpeachable food critics in the history of america \u2014 having her write that in the new york times propelled that restaurant to its permanent status", "i think that can\u2019t happen nowadays, honestly, for other reasons", "this was pre-internet, pre-yelp, all that", " then all of a sudden, we got that and i was horrified, because one of our goals was completed so early", "we wouldn\u2019t have our lodestar", "he was like, \u201cdear god, can you let me enjoy it for like a minute?\u201d  tim ferriss: to you", "nick kokonas: yeah, yeah", "he was mad at me", "i was like, \u201cthat\u2019s terrible!\u201d i was happy", "but i was also like, \u201coh, no, now what do we do", "we need to find another artificial construct here to go after.\u201d  tim ferriss: enough of this", "i need to find happiness", "get this other happiness out of my face", "nick kokonas: yeah, for sure", "yeah, no", "i really do believe that it\u2019s often the process is so rewarding that when you get something done, it can be a letdown", "i wanted that process to go", "then, unfortunately, six months later, grant was diagnosed with stage iv cancer and given six months to live", "so weirdly, that was the moment that after he was going through treatment, where i started going into the restaurant at night", "because, remember, i\u2019m not a service professional", "i was running the business of the restaurant", "i would start going in at night and start asking really dumb questions again", "weirdly, our goal was to keep alinea open for when he came back", "mind you, he only missed 12 days, 14 days of service during really intense chemo and radiation", "but he was given six months to live", " when people are in that situation and their livelihood is tied to this restaurant, even despite their loyalties, oftentimes they just need to find another job", "because they\u2019re like, hey, in four months, this place is going to be closed", "and in the midst of that, we decided to do our first book, really to chronicle what he had accomplished", "because for him, he felt like that would be his legacy", "he thought he was going to die", "he was told he was going to die", "in the midst of creating a self-created, self-published book, and trying to do that differently, and then keeping a dwindling staff motivated, trying to let him know that it would still be there when he got well, all of that, i started going, \u201cthis place is run in strange ways, man", "this industry is not run right.\u201d  i started asking basic questions", "like, \u201cif we have a wait list for 100 people on a wednesday, why do we do 74 people on a wednesday, but 86 on a saturday?\u201d and the answer was because our incentives were misaligned", "the service industry as a whole can\u2019t run at 100% every single day of the week, unless they\u2019re incentivized to do so", "you could go like, \u201cwell, yeah, every server there will make an extra $100 a night or whatever.\u201d but they\u2019re going, \u201clook, if every night was saturday, i\u2019d be dead", "it\u2019s really hard work", "you need to figure out ways of load-balancing that and making every day the same", "you end up way ahead.\u201d so from a business perspective, that\u2019s when my sort of self-education in this industry came forward", "it came forward in a way that i think i was less patient with everything because we were also going through this really difficult, emotional time", " consequently, when i didn\u2019t get answers that made any sense, instead of being diplomatic about it, i would just be like, \u201cwell, that\u2019s stupid.\u201d which cut some of the normal social filter off, and i\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t a pleasant time to be around anybody", "but i also think it was accepted within that environment at that time, because everyone knew what we were going through", "and so, years later, when we finally were like, \u201chey, we\u2019ve got some ideas to build next and the aviary,\u201d that\u2019s when i went, \u201cwell, we\u2019re going to do things totally differently here", "anyone who\u2019s not on board, even though they work for us, if you\u2019re not on board all the way in on getting rid of normal reservations and not using telephones and doing all these things, we don\u2019t have a place for you here.\u201d man, it really worked", " that was the basis of \u2013 i talked to every software company in the industry asking for their apis, asking to build essentially what\u2019s options pricing software on top of reservations systems", "opentable told me no", "the pos systems told me no", "i called theaters and went, what ticketing system do you use", "all of those told me no", "i hired a single programmer, and he and i in six weeks built a really rudimentary booking system", "but the first day we turned it on, we sold $562,000 of tickets to our restaurant for the first time ever", " tim ferriss: okay, so pause here for a second", " nick kokonas: i know, we\u2019re way ahead", "tim ferriss: no, no", "this is great", "a few things for folks who are not familiar", "api \u2013 application programming interface \u2013 it\u2019s how you can effectively link into someone else\u2019s software", "pos \u2013 point of sale, not piece of shit", " nick kokonas: ah, but it is a piece of shit", " tim ferriss: it may also be a piece of shit", "what were the design specs that you were looking for", "in other words, before you get to the $500,000+ with a snap of the fingers, what were you trying to fix or what were you trying to create", " nick kokonas: i get a lot of grief for saying this in the industry and in the press", "but basically, whenever you make a restaurant reservation, one of the two of you talking is lying to each other", "if you think about it, no other form, no other industry form of entertainment, which dining out is a form of entertainment", "i know it\u2019s sustenance", "i know there\u2019s so much culture embedded in it and all that, but you could eat at home", "no other form of entertainment you just call them up and say, \u201chey, hold a seat to the bears game or the cubs game, or the opera, and i\u2019ll show up around 7:30.\u201d then they tell you, \u201cyeah, yeah, we\u2019ll have a seat ready for you at 7:30.\u201d then when you get there, they go, \u201coh, you know what", "go wait over there for 30 or 40 minutes, because we\u2019re running a little behind tonight.\u201d  the reason that they\u2019re running behind is because they overbooked because about 15 to 18 percent of people don\u2019t show up", "so, they overbook", "they also know that if they tell you that they\u2019ll really seat you at 9:00 and you wanted an 8:15, you\u2019ll just go to the restaurant down the street from them that will lie to them, right", "tim ferriss: right", "nick kokonas: so they do that and ultimately it\u2019s just bad all around", "it\u2019s bad for the restaurant", "it\u2019s wasteful for food", "and it\u2019s bad hospitality", "there are so many pop culture references and entire sitcom episodes built around someone trying to get into a restaurant", "it\u2019s absurd", "it\u2019s completely absurd", "i looked at our no-show rate at alinea, data-driven, tracked it", "i looked at what we call short-seated tables, like the number of tables that were four people, but only two showed up", "the dirty secret there is like, people will go like, \u201cwell, what do you have available?\u201d \u201cwell, i have an 8:30 for four.\u201d \u201cokay, we\u2019ll take that.\u201d they never intended to bring the other two people", "that\u2019s just as bad as a two-top no showing", "we only have 74 seats in there, so it\u2019s a yield management problem", " so, 5 to 8 percent of our revenue every night was being lost to that transaction", "that was a non-transaction", "so i wanted to figure out ways to do two things", "one, i wanted to figure out a way to make it transactional", "because, again, you asked about professor thaler", "one of the key tenets is, there\u2019s a little bit of skin in the game, right", "when people have a small vested interest in the outcome of something, or even if i gave you a pencil as a gift, and then 30 minutes later i want to take it back, you will get so mad, even though you didn\u2019t care about that pencil", "you\u2019re like, \u201cwhat was that", "dude gave me a gift, and now he\u2019s pulling it back,\u201d you know", " tim ferriss: it\u2019s like the expected value of a mug", "if you asked them how much they would spend to buy the mug versus giving them the mug and saying, \u201chow much will you accept to sell it?\u201d the differential", " nick kokonas: yeah, it\u2019s huge", "so, that came to me one day because my kids wanted to go see a movie at night that i did not want to go see", "i would\u2019ve easily paid $50 to not go to this movie", "then my wife basically says, \u201chey, let\u2019s go to that movie", "i go on fandango", "i buy four tickets", "$60, whatever it was", "at 5:30 at night, pouring rain, and everyone\u2019s napping", "they\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, i don\u2019t want to go.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cget your asses in the car, we\u2019re going to the movie, man!\u201d now i would have easily paid that $60 to not go to the movie, but once i had the sunk cost of paying for the movie, my psychology totally flipped", "i was like, \u201cwe\u2019re going to this movie that i don\u2019t want to go to.\u201d i literally irrationally made everyone go to the movie", "which weirdly cost, from an emotional family standpoint, all bad all the way around, right", " so i thought about it and i was like, \u201cwow, what if people put down a small deposit on times when demand exceeds supply", "so like a saturday night, 8:00, that\u2019s the best seats at the opera house", "let\u2019s see if people will pre-pay for that or put down $20 for it", "that\u2019s fully credited at the end of their meal", "it\u2019s not a cover charge", "i\u2019m not trying to squeeze people on the actual cost of the meal", "i\u2019m just trying to go like, \u201cyeah, let\u2019s see if people will make a commitment.\u201d everybody told me, \u201cno, no one\u2019s going to do that", "this is not the way it works.\u201d but if you look back historically, this is the interesting part", "again, it\u2019s about digging in deep on something", " if you look back historically, restaurant reservations started with the telephone", "at the time that we were starting to do this, the telephone was dying", "i didn\u2019t know that at the time", "that was eight years ago", "but i have a computer in my pocket", "if you ring me and i don\u2019t know your number, i don\u2019t want to talk to you", "i don\u2019t answer it", "i\u2019d much rather receive a little piece of text letting me know what\u2019s going on than a phone call", "similarly, like calling a restaurant is an antiquated thing to do at this point", "but long before the telephone, people got room and board", "what room and board was literally, you go to an inn and you get a room for the night", "then, do you need food", "okay, well, you get a board of food", "that was literally it", "and you\u2019d prepay for it", "there were hundreds of years of that long before there was a telephone and people called and said, \u201ci\u2019d like to eat at your restaurant.\u201d \u201csure, we\u2019ll let you in.\u201d  as the technology for the telephone has morphed into what we all have in our pockets now, i just wanted to update that whole transaction", "i also wanted to acknowledge that tuesday nights should be cheaper than a saturday night", "it has to work both ways", "i always thought uber could fix their surge pricing issues by having discounted pricing when there was no demand", "just move pricing intelligently without directions", "if you move pricing in two directions, that whole argument goes away", "so, we did that", "we priced out different prices by day of the week and times of day", "so 5:00 p.m", "on wednesday at alinea is still cheaper than 8:00 p.m", "on a saturday", "by a lot", "by $80 to $100 a person", "you know what happens", " we have hundreds of restaurants doing this on our software called tock", "what happens is people buy the most expensive seats first, and the cheapest seats first", "which is exactly what you\u2019d expect, actually", "because some people are price conscious and go like, \u201cwow, this is a really expensive meal, but holy cow, i don\u2019t really care if i eat at 5:00 on tuesday", "great", "i can save $400.\u201d then there\u2019s some people that go, \u201ci only eat at 8:00 p.m", "on saturday.\u201d okay, that\u2019s fine", "pay a little more", " tim ferriss: or they\u2019re attracted to the fact that it is the most expensive", "nick kokonas: sure", "that happens too", "then there\u2019s a whole bunch of tools that over time can be built on top of that to sell wine pairings or sell books", "we sell 20 alinea books a day on checkout with the booking process", "that\u2019s a ton", "because we\u2019re not going to exit through the gift shop at alinea", "it\u2019s a michelin three-star restaurant", "so we would subtly have one book near the restrooms that people could peruse, but it didn\u2019t say, \u201cbuy the book\u201d or anything like that", "so typically, we\u2019d sell one or two per night", "now on checkout, when you book alinea, it says, \u201cwould you like to buy an alinea book, personalized?\u201d 20 people a night get it", "that\u2019s $400,000 in revenue a year", "it\u2019s crazy, right", " tim ferriss: that\u2019s incredible", " nick kokonas: it\u2019s amazing to me that no one did that beforehand", "because ultimately, people can\u2019t buy what they don\u2019t see", "people don\u2019t want to be upsold inside of a restaurant", "there\u2019s nothing worse in my mind \u2013 some places, today\u2019s special is today\u2019s special and it\u2019s real and you know that", "but sometimes, it\u2019s just the old fish", " tim ferriss: right", "sunday night", " nick kokonas: yeah, right", "we all know these things", "i think no restaurant wants to raise their hand and go, \u201cyup, that\u2019s all true", "we were lying to our customers, and we are not really going to seat you at 8:15.\u201d i think when i said that, you can look back through some articles", "i remember that there was an article, i think it was in gq, that they interviewed a grizzled veteran \u2013 he didn\u2019t use his name \u2013 he said, \u201can overbook and a bar to wait in has always worked for me.\u201d i was just like, \u201chow does that not sound like terrible hospitality to everyone reading that?\u201d  tim ferriss: yeah, for sure", "there are so many systems that have similar overbooking, load-balancing issues, right", "you look at airlines, you look at hospitality", "nick kokonas: my dentist", " tim ferriss: yeah", " nick kokonas: i have a great dentist", "they only do it via phone call or email", "so i have to play a guessing game", "it\u2019s like going into a clothing store and going, \u201cyeah, i\u2019m looking for a blue, v-neck, cashmere sweater.\u201d they\u2019re like, \u201cno, don\u2019t have one; guess again.\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cput the shit on display, man", "just tell me what day you can clean my teeth", "show me and i\u2019ll just go online and hit the button.\u201d  tim ferriss: when you then debuted the ticketing option, if i\u2019m labeling it properly, how did you prime the pump for that", "did you need to prime the pump to have what certainly seems like a windfall", " nick kokonas: we did a video where next restaurant was about a restaurant that\u2019s always new, essentially", "what\u2019s one of the big problems of the restaurant industry", "well, when you open a new restaurant, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is, people are going to show up for like five or six months", "then after that, you\u2019ve got to struggle to get regulars and find new audiences and all that", "but people like the \u201cnew,\u201d right", "the other problem is that our own staff and chefs were the kind of people who i said to grant one time, he cooked this amazing french dish at alinea for me right in the middle of his sickness, because i had driven down from michigan", "i have never eaten before or after in the alinea kitchen, but he whipped up this little french dish for me of duck", "i was like, \u201cman, let\u2019s open a french restaurant some day.\u201d he went, \u201ceh, we\u2019ll get bored after six months.\u201d  then i was at one of our chef\u2019s homes on a day off on a tuesday", "he loves thai food", "he made this amazing thai meal", "amazing", "i was like, \u201cwow, i had no idea these guys were so versatile.\u201d then it made sense", "hey, these are passionate, amazingly talented people", "it dawned on me, \u201clet\u2019s just change the restaurant every four months.\u201d then we dwelled on that for like a year, thinking it was impossible to do", "then grant said \u2013 i said, \u201clet\u2019s start with a french menu.\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cwell, what does that mean", "there\u2019s southern france, there\u2019s loire valley", "there\u2019s france that\u2019s nouvelle cuisine", "then there\u2019s france from 100 years ago", "totally different.\u201d i was like, \u201cyeah, paris 1906", "i don\u2019t need to explain to you what that is", "you\u2019d want to eat that.\u201d  if someone said, \u201cnew restaurant opening, what\u2019s the menu", "it\u2019s paris 1906.\u201d i\u2019d go like, \u201ccool, i want to do a little time travel and see what that was like.\u201d so, as soon as we had a city and a time, we instantly knew", "that was the idea that kept us up at night", "where we went like, \u201cwow, look at all these different places we can travel, and what does that restaurant look like and how do you create a kitchen versatile enough to make all these different cuisines", "how do you make it not feel like disneyland, where one time you have a theme of paris, and the next time you have a theme of japan?\u201d so you have to do with an austere minimalism", "tim ferriss: is there a reason why you chose the year 1906", " nick kokonas: i\u2019m doing some research, and i may get the exact date wrong, because this is eight years ago that i did the research, but i believe the seine flooded in 1908", "somewhere around there", "and so escoffier, the father of french cuisine, was at the ritz then", "that was the height of that era of cuisine", "then after the seine flooded, that\u2019s where you got your brasseries and bistros, because they had to go to a more casual; it opened up for more people", "it took the price point down", "it made it more approachable", "and it wiped out dozens of these fancy restaurants", "rent got cheap and all of a sudden, \u201chey, we\u2019re going to get this new style of restaurant.\u201d that\u2019s roughly, as i recall it", "somebody\u2019s going to listen to this and tell me i\u2019m all wrong", "that\u2019s where we landed, because we do this escoffier menu", "boy, we argued about that too", "they didn\u2019t have blenders then, electric blenders", " tim ferriss: so, you wanted to mimic the production", "nick kokonas: i did", "grant did not", "i remember we had invited the press to a practice dinner", " tim ferriss: grant\u2019s like, \u201chey, pal", "you don\u2019t have to make the food.\u201d  nick kokonas: well, partly that", "but partly he was like, \u201cshould we make it intentionally worse than we can?\u201d because the recipes were really vague", "they didn\u2019t even call for salt", "so in the middle of this press dinner where we had the new york times there, we had all sorts of these people there, which i\u2019ll never do again", "that was a genuine error", "we were still arguing out conceptually what this thing would be", "then we serve dinner, and we were openly \u2013 he\u2019d come out of the kitchen and we\u2019d openly argue about it", " tim ferriss: this is at the press dinner", "nick kokonas: yeah, yeah, yeah", "i remember he brought the soup out and i was like, \u201coh, they must have used the actual blenders, right?\u201d modern blenders", "because the mouthfeel was perfect", "i was like, \u201coh, you used the blenders?\u201d he was like, \u201cthe recipe didn\u2019t call for salt either, did it", "should i have not used that and had it taste like shit?\u201d then i was like, \u201cwell, maybe you don\u2019t know that they didn\u2019t have refrigeration then either and they packed the vegetables in salt as a desiccant, so they were almost all pre-salted by the time they got to paris.\u201d and that was it", "people were just like, \u201cthese guys don\u2019t like each other at all.\u201d that was our method", "that\u2019s what we did", "to the day we opened, we had those arguments", "then in terms of the software, man, i didn\u2019t sleep for a week", "we set it up on rackspace", "it didn\u2019t work right", "i had never done anything like that before", "it was like, no one would help", "i think nobody would help", " tim ferriss: when you say nobody would help, you mean competitors, potential \u2013 nick kokonas: potential allies, potential, these are people at software companies", "tim ferriss: i got it", "why wouldn\u2019t they help", "nick kokonas: in the case of opentable, they had a monopoly", "so, why \u2013 tim ferriss: that makes sense to me", " nick kokonas: in terms of everyone else, i think they just didn\u2019t get it", "but even people within my own company thought this was a fool\u2019s errand", "grant, for sure, he will fully admit this now, thought it was a terrible idea", " tim ferriss: why did he think it was a terrible idea", "nick kokonas: because it\u2019s not hospitable", "it\u2019s not hospitality", " tim ferriss: it\u2019s low touch, not high touch", "nick kokonas: correct", "and hugely the case where all of a sudden the price is different every day", "are people going to get that", "i just kept looking to other industries", "no one has a problem with it when they go to a baseball game", "they\u2019re not sitting above the dugout and then the guy who\u2019s in the third deck back row looks down and goes, \u201coh, that guy, he totally stole that ticket from me.\u201d they\u2019re two different price points", "i think people inherently get that without having to explain it to them", " tim ferriss: if i might, how far in advance of the opening were you hoping to launch the software, and when did you end up launching the software", " nick kokonas: i launched it about seven hours before the first dinner", " tim ferriss: holy shit", " nick kokonas: i had hoped to have done it four to five weeks ahead of that", "it was literally a one-man operation plus me; one programmer and me", "when we launched it, rackspace, this is 2010, i\u2019m not saying anything bad about rackspace", "i probably set it up wrong", "2010", "it did not, it\u2019s supposed to auto load correct, and self-propagate", "neither happened", "we had 17,000 people on our email list that had signed up on the website to be notified when the bookings went on sale", "i was expecting maybe 700 to show up \u2014 should be fine", "something like 8,000 or 9,000 showed up", "everyone just kept hitting the refresh key", "here\u2019s another fatal error of stupidity", "this is not the way our software is built now because we have professionals here", "but basically, my admin login was on the very same server as everybody\u2019s public access", "so i couldn\u2019t even go in to configure", " the good news on this is that i couldn\u2019t answer hundreds of angry emails all at once", "so i created a facebook group for the business, which in 2010 not very many people did", "if you go back and scroll all the way down to the beginning of that, you\u2019ll see me going, \u201chey, if everybody could please stop refreshing, i can sort this out.\u201d what was really cool is that people felt part of something", "they felt like \u201cwow, holy shit, this guy is actually doing this himself", "we\u2019re part of this experiment and we\u2019re on the inside of it.\u201d i got a lot of empathy from the customers, even though they were the ones that were unable to get what they wanted", "then when it finally started working, i had literally not showered in five days", "i had pizza boxes laying around", "it looked like a bad movie startup thing", "i had a beard", "i was just strung out, manic", " i remember i called grant", "it was opening day", "he said, \u201chow many should i prep for?\u201d i said, \u201cprep for full", "because if not, we\u2019ll turn on the phones.\u201d what i didn\u2019t tell him was that i didn\u2019t order the phones because i didn\u2019t want to have a failsafe", " tim ferriss: you\u2019d burned the ships", " nick kokonas: i just wanted to make sure i forced myself to work", "we had no phone line", "when it started working, i would double-click, one of the functions was double-click on a table", "if it was yellow, it was held; the public couldn\u2019t see it", "i could make it available by double-clicking it and it would turn green", "then when it was sold, it would turn red", "but the first time i did that to let more inventory out, and clearly things were working, it turned red so fast, i thought it was broken", "so then i went into the credit card processing and saw, \u201coh, my gosh, someone bought that that fast.\u201d i called grant and i said, \u201cdude, you\u2019ve got to come to my house.\u201d he was like, \u201cuh, we\u2019re opening a restaurant in like six hours", "what\u2019s going on?\u201d i said, \u201cas the guy who helped save your life, get in a fucking taxi and come over here, because i need to show you something!\u201d he looked at me and went like, \u201cwhat is wrong with you?\u201d i took him upstairs to my office and i explained to him what i just explained to you", "i said, \u201cclick on one of those and make it available.\u201d he said, \u201cwhich one?\u201d i go, \u201cany one in the next month.\u201d he clicked like three weeks out at 9:30", "it instantly turned red", "in another window, i had the credit card thing up", "i go, \u201clook, mr", "jones bought that.\u201d he went, \u201creally?\u201d i went, \u201cyup, there are 4,000 people waiting for you to do that right now.\u201d that was the moment at which i was basically like, \u201cthis is the best thing i\u2019ve ever built.\u201d because it was functionally different than any way that anybody was doing this", "it wasn\u2019t novel", "it was just applied in a novel way", "what was interesting is that, of course, the software itself sucked", "but as a proof of concept, it was awesome", " tim ferriss: quick question on that, if you\u2019re comfortable answering", "how much money had you put into developing the software at that point, roughly", "nick kokonas: i\u2019m going to say $115,000, roughly", "tim ferriss: in your mind, were you completely confident it would work", "or \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t have to be a or b; there could be c, d, e, f \u2014 or were you like, \u201cfor $115k or whatever it might be, even if you budgeted for less and it overran, even if there\u2019s a 20 percent chance that this works, it is worth risking the hours and time because it will so completely transform what we\u2019re doing, and if it fucking fails, who cares?\u201d nick kokonas: correct", "the latter one, yeah", "again, it\u2019s about the asymmetric risk, right", "it was also about this thing as i dug into how alinea ran, there\u2019s thing that you can fix and control, and there\u2019s things you can\u2019t", "this was the one that i would answer phones at alinea and it was like being a therapist", "people would go like, \u201ci would like to make a reservation on my anniversary, seven weeks from now on a thursday.\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201ci\u2019m really sorry, sir, it\u2019s totally full.\u201d 100 percent of the time they thought you were lying to them", "consequently, i realized that we were saying \u201cno\u201d to people more than we were saying \u201cyes.\u201d that even when we said \u201cno\u201d in a nice way and took 10 minutes to do so, people thought that we were lying, or that they weren\u2019t important to us, or any of those things", " i felt that transparency was actually more important than the actual money and the actual yield management", "i felt like allowing people to see the entirety of the inventory was the most important thing", "i had the same thing with the trading markets", "they\u2019ve moved to more and more transparency, more and more speed", "this is true across every industry", "i just felt like \u201cwow, this industry i found myself in was so backwards.\u201d i just wanted to make the whole thing more transparent", "even if it didn\u2019t go beyond my own restaurants, i was totally fine with that", "in fact, i didn\u2019t do anything with it for four years", "i didn\u2019t really intend on making it a software product", "i intended to fix my own problems", "i think often that\u2019s where good ideas come from", " tim ferriss: super often", "the scratching of your own itch", "at least you know you have a market of one", "guaranteed market of one", "i also want to point out, we were talking about asymmetric risk earlier, and you\u2019re like, \u201ci want to stand to make 3-4x what i stand to lose.\u201d if you run the math, and i\u2019m sure i\u2019m missing a lot of subtleties here, but when you said we booked $500,000 and it cost $115,000, we\u2019re getting very much within the ballpark of that", "nick kokonas: yeah, but i didn\u2019t even, well, since then, we\u2019ve taken our margins at our restaurants from 10 to 12 percent to at times in good months, 20 to 25 percent", "in an industry that over the last five years, if you read \u2013 i give a talk called tuesday is not saturday, and seven things you already now but are doing nothing about", "it\u2019s a talk that i give to the restaurant industry", "one of the things that i point out in there is that there\u2019s so many obvious things that you could be doing to improve your hospitality, to improve your booking process, to get rid of food waste", "but people tend to just kind of move along because it\u2019s a really chaotic environment", "it\u2019s hard to make change in it because every day is game day", "you wake up every day and 100 people are going to come through the door", "if your fishmonger doesn\u2019t show up, you need to figure out what to do with that", " it\u2019s not really about the return on that one investment at that one moment", "it\u2019s more like 1,000 small improvements over time", "if i look back at that system that i built then compared to what we have now, it\u2019s a miniscule part of what it turned into", "but it was the seed of an idea, which is more important, which is, \u201chey, let\u2019s shake things up.\u201d then i got a great cfo, who was at bain consulting", "he came on to help manage the building of next", "when he said he wanted to build out a business team, i was like, \u201cgreat", "run with it.\u201d so we\u2019ve built out food cost analysis that uses marimekko charts", "it\u2019s totally different because it\u2019s visual", "you give that to the chef and \u2013 tim ferriss: it uses what charts", "nick kokonas: marimekko", "if you don\u2019t know marimekko \u2013 if you get nothing out of this, one of the greatest visualizations in charts that you could do in excel or whatever", "it\u2019s hard to do vocally, but imagine a square where each of your x-axis is the percentage of let\u2019s say food cost", "then each square within there is meat or produce", "but the whole of the square is 100 percent", "the y-axis is 100 percent of one metric, and the x-axis is 100 percent of another", "so, you could look at

just the time here", "i think that people who are passionately curious will be given a problem like that and will come up with interesting solutions to find out what the answer may be", "that\u2019s enough", " tim ferriss: i want to add some commentary on the question that i asked, which is i think it\u2019s incredible that you do pay them for that independent research, which is also acting an entrepreneurial training/filtering for them", "but i wouldn\u2019t have judged you harshly at all if you said, no, that\u2019s on their own time", "the reason i say that is that if you are going to be investigating black boxes as an entrepreneur, there are going to be periods of time where you are doing it in the evenings; you are doing it on the weekends; you are doing it without a clear road to immediate cash flow, right", "so i wouldn\u2019t have judged you if you said, \u201cyou know what", "i am paying them full time for their normal job, but if they want to tackle one of these black boxes, that\u2019s considered extracurricular time.\u201d so i wouldn\u2019t have judged you harshly if you had responded in the negative on that", " nick kokonas: i guess to back up a little bit,

enough, i will pose some more difficult questions", "but they\u2019re not working for me, you know what i mean", "there\u2019s a guy who brought me a food product about a year ago", "it was interesting, but not super compelling", "i said, \u201cif you did these five things, it would be a lot more compelling for me to be involved and to help with it and all that.\u201d yesterday, i got a box in the mail, and he had done not only the five things i said, but said, \u201chey, when i started doing those, these seven other things popped up", "here\u2019s where the product is", "here\u2019s the people we signed", "here\u2019s the airline we just signed to carry the product", "i would love to have you still involved, even though we\u2019re so much farther down the road than i thought i\u2019d be a year later.\u201d that\u2019s super cool", " i didn\u2019t pay that guy, obviously", "but there\u2019s a person who\u2019s truly entrepreneurial and did this on his own time", "but if they\u2019re working here, if they work for the alinea group, if they work for tock, for sure you could take time during your day during your normal business that\u2019s a project that we\u2019re working on", "we also try not to have such harshly defined roles, not within the restaurant", "if you\u2019re a server, if you\u2019re a captain, if you\u2019re a line cook, you\u2019re probably not working on my truffle project, realistically", "but on the business side, we certainly have people who work in roles as a lawyer or an analyst or something like that who want to get involved with our publishing project, or who want to get involved with the truffle project, or whatever it may be", "i\u2019m happy to pull them in and try to include them", "like you said, you used a word as an entrepreneurial filter", "i would say 95 percent of the time, people filter themselves out", " tim ferriss: right", "i agree with that", "they\u2019re going to self-select or self-select out", "are there any particular books or resources that you have found useful on hiring or managing", " nick kokonas: if you found one, let me know", "hiring is so hard", "i think it\u2019s the hardest of all things to do", "i think my style of interviewing people is totally different than it was 20 years ago", "we used the word \u201cself-selecting\u201d just a moment ago", "it\u2019s exactly what i do", "i kind of bring people in", "i let them know what i\u2019m about, what the company\u2019s about", "they\u2019ve probably already been interviewed by other people before they get to me", "at that point, i let them know what the upsides and downsides of working here are", "i let them know what the expectations are", "then i tell them people self-select into a job", "you don\u2019t want to come here if you\u2019re going to fail, because that would be terrible", "i don\u2019t want you to come here and fail, because that would be a waste of my time and resources and would also feel awful",

good, what\u2019s bad, what\u2019s good about working for me, personally", "the fact that maybe you\u2019ll never see me again", "it\u2019s a big enough organization where there are definitely people working here who i don\u2019t know at all", "but people tend to join organizations where they want to work", "i try to make them be able to say no easier than they can say yes", " tim ferriss: what would be some examples of how you do that", " nick kokonas: i judge the person by what their pain points are", "one of the things i like to ask, which kind of resonates probably with you, i say, what are the last five books you read", "i\u2019ve got to tell you, that\u2019s a really hard question to answer", "even if you\u2019re a voracious reader, it\u2019s really hard", "you remember a book from two years ago, but you can\u2019t remember the one you read two months ago, sometimes", "at least i can\u2019t", "that is a great filter on people", "a couple things will happen", "one, the person who is a voracious reader will go, \u201coh, my god, i swear to god i read like 20 books this year", "let\u2019s see.\u201d then they will really start going, \u201coh, i read one three months ago that was this and it was about that.\u201d you can tell that they\u2019re intellectually curious and read a lot", "you\u2019ll also get a person who goes, \u201clook, i haven\u2019t read a book in 20 years, but every night i go home and i do woodworking, and that\u2019s my outlet", "that\u2019s where i focus", "that\u2019s my zen moment.\u201d that\u2019s a valid answer to that question, too", "you don\u2019t have to be a reader", "some people will just lie through their teeth", "they\u2019ll answer what they think is the smart answer to that question", "i don\u2019t want that person there", "tim ferriss: i read war and peace, and then i went to the problems of philosophy", " nick kokonas: yes, yes, yes", "then the 4-hour workweek, right", " tim ferriss: definitely not the right answer", " nick kokonas: so there\u2019s that, and i ask that kind of question", "but then things like, \u201cdo you enjoy writing?\u201d one of my things is, if someone doesn\u2019t like to write, when people ask what i do for a living, i say, \u201ci\u2019m a writer.\u201d they go like, \u201coh, you\u2019ve written a couple books?\u201d i go, \u201cno, no, no", "i write about 400 emails a day.\u201d that skill is hugely important right now", "if someone doesn\u2019t like to write, they\u2019re not going to want to work for me", "because when they send out an email and i\u2019m cced on it and it isn\u2019t a well-thought-out little thing, the answer coming back is, \u201chey, here\u2019s four ways to improve this.\u201d at some point, it\u2019ll be like, \u201creally", "you did that same mistake again?\u201d it comes off kind of harsh in email", " so if you\u2019re the kind of person that doesn\u2019t take feedback well or doesn\u2019t want to learn, man, i am lacking patience

great", " tim ferriss: yeah, it simplifies matters", " nick kokonas: it\u2019s done with a smile", "i\u2019m not trying to terrorize people when they come in and interview", "then there\u2019s some

self-selected into an organization that people ask a lot of questions", "i love that i can be in a room and come up with an idea, and everyone there will just be like, \u201cwell, that\u2019s a great idea", "there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be able to do that in the next six months, because that\u2019s not in our capacity at our size right now.\u201d  tim ferriss: i think a question on a lot of people\u2019s minds, and a pain point for most people listening, will be email", "so you seem to be at least confident in your treatment of email", "400 is a lot of email", "do you have any particular commandments", "dos, do nots, times you check, things you check first", "any types of systems or approaches that allow you to maintain a degree of sanity with the amount of email that you must receive", " nick kokonas: you\u2019re going to hate this answer, tim", "i am terrible at it", "it used to be not so long ago that i personally replied to absolutely every single email that came in myself", "i used to have an auto-sign that basically was like, if i don\u2019t reply to you within five minutes, i\u2019m dead or asleep", "it\u2019s the opposite of everything you stand for", "i know that", "i was listening to jason fried \u2013 jason fried\u2019s a friend \u2013 i was listening to his podcast with you", "i don\u2019t get it at all", "i would love nothing more than to re-work or to not work, work four-day weeks or have six-week projects and all the stuff that he espouses", "he\u2019s a friend", "he\u2019s an investor in one of my businesses", "but man, that\u2019s not how i function at all", "i weirdly think that he misses cause-and-effect a little bit", "he has a very successful company, and that\u2019s the cause that allows the effect, which is the ability to manage your time really well", " i live really paranoid", "i\u2019m more comfortable that way", "also, i feel a weird moral responsibility to reply to the people who\u2019ve taken their time out of their day to write us a note, even if it\u2019s not critical business for me", "one of the things that i did for about 10 years, that i loved doing when we first started alinea, was i would have google alerts set up and i would find some blog that only some woman and her mother read", "i would reply personally", "\u201cwow, thank you for the great write-up of alinea.\u201d they would be mind-blown that i found it and all that", "i treated email that way for a long period of time", "unfortunately, now i can\u2019t quite do that", " so i do have a bunch of filters and whatnot, but i didn\u2019t even set them up", "my business partner, brian fitzpatrick, who used to be the head of google in chicago, he runs the engineering team and he\u2019s the ceo of tock, he said, \u201cdude, you\u2019re slipping,

wake up in the morning and look at our bazillion social media messages and whatnot, kind of pick a random one, and just answer it", "i want to be involved in knowing what our customers are asking,

honestly", "i will tell you a funny thing is that when i go away on vacation, i do try to concoct a pretty funny \u2013 i basically say, \u201clook, i\u2019m going to be on a mountain or on a boat or whatever, and i\u2019m not going to be able to reply", "i would make these elaborate stories up, almost as like a fun piece of art project as to why i couldn\u2019t do it", "one year, every time i went away, i basically said, \u201ci\u2019m going to visit a panda i adopted and going back to chicago.\u201d it ended the year around christmastime when i went on break with a picture of a baby panda, and a really mediocre photoshop job of me standing there with the panda", " the chicago tribune called me up like three days later, like, \u201cis it going to the lincoln park zoo?\u201d i was

of a consulting project; very lucrative", "he was looking at me really funny", "i said, \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d he said, \u201cwell, i really wished we had worked together, but then you went to that sex retreat, and i just couldn\u2019t get it past everybody.\u201d i was looking at him going, like, \u201cwhat are you talking about?\u201d then i remembered like four years earlier, my out-of-office reply", "i told him it was a joke, like the panda", "he did not find any humor in it", "i did", "i thought it was hilarious, even though we lost the business, i thought it was really funny", "so if you ever get a really unusual out-of-office reply from me, it\u2019s fiction", "probably", " tim ferriss: i love that", "if you\u2019re serious all the time, you\u2019re never going to get the actual serious work done", "you\u2019re going to burn out before that ever happens", "i also want to underscore one thing", "then i want to ask you about a black box that you and i have talked about quite a bit, which is publishing", "the fact that you pick a message to reply to, even if it\u2019s one, is really important", "i\u2019ve noticed this certainly with the audits that i have, listeners, readers, etc", "it is not physically possible for me to reply to everyone; it would also be anathema to everything that i\u2019m espousing in many of the books", " but i do want to demonstrate that i am listening", "i think that it goes a really long way, even if you do not personally reply to people, if you are able to prove that you\u2019re paying attention", "that seems to resolve a lot, or at least act as a salve for people out there who very seldomly feel heard, which does not always necessitate a response", "i just wanted to point out that it might seem like a drop in the ocean, but it actually has further reaching implications when you do what you were describing", " nick kokonas: yeah, i feel like it\u2019s genuine", "first of all, i\u2019m always curious what people are writing about to the restaurants, what they are writing about to me", "my linkedin profile basically \u2013 i don\u2019t really read linkedin at all", "i keep it", "i think it\u2019s important to have it, but i don\u2019t ever read the messages on there", "but in my bio, it basically says \u201cif you can find my email address, i will incite this; i will reply to you", "so that gets rid of all of the marketing crap that comes in", "but every now and then, i get a subject line to the email address that\u2019s on there that says \u201chey, via your linkedin bio,\u201d i\u2019ll read that and reply", "it just shows me that (a) there\u2019s an actual human on the other line; it\u2019s not just some marketing thing, and (b) they really do have something that they want to talk about", " it\u2019s little things like that are puzzle filters, that i call them", "where i just create a little bit of a barrier", "if you\u2019re really into it and you really want to talk to me, you can pretty find me pretty easily", "i\u2019m not that hidden", " tim ferriss: the detail is really important here", "the mini-hurdle", "i have a friend i\u2019m not going to mention by name because he\u2019ll get deluged, but he is a very successful author and journalist", "when he is hiring for different positions, part-time or full-time, at the bottom of the job description on a job site or wherever it might be, in small print at the very bottom", "it will say, do not send a message on this platform", "do not send an email, even though an email address is given earlier", "call this number and leave a voicemail answering the following things", "automatically, he takes the pool of 1,000 people who are going to do the wrong thing, and finds the 10 people who are actually paying attention", " nick kokonas: yeah, 100 percent", " tim ferriss: publishing", "we didn\u2019t really talk much about it", "can you give just a tiny bit of background on the aviary, and then some of your related publishing investigations", "which i think is not an inappropriate word", "if you could give people a little bit of context", " nick kokonas: yeah, i\u2019m going to back up before the aviary, just a little bit", "for a chef, doing a cookbook is something that they dream about if they\u2019re a serious chef, from the time they\u2019re 15", "just like if you\u2019re a basketball player, you want to make the nba", "or if you\u2019re a runner, you want to be in the olympics or whatever", "to grant, to a bunch of chefs, having their own ideas in a physical, beautiful cookbook is a holy grail for them", "it\u2019s very sacred", "what was interesting is that just before grant was sick, we started to get a lot of publishing offers", "the natural inclination was to go to what he knew, which was artisan press, which published the french laundry book, which is one of the bestselling, high-end cookbooks ever", "it\u2019s certainly beautiful", "it was very revolutionary at its time", "i think it was published in about \u201998 or \u201999, something like that", " the typical publishing deal came into us, which was great that they were coming in", "it was $250,000 to $300,000", "they would basically say, well, out of that, you\u2019re going to pay for the designer and the photographer, and you need a 30-day photoshoot", "here are the guidelines for how many photos you want in the book, to keep costs down, and all that", "i looked at all that, and all the offers came within about 10 percent of each other, which immediately the hair on the back of my neck, the spidey sense starts telling me that something back there is pricing this is an unusual way", "then i started going, \u201coh, this is actually like the music industry.\u201d  tim ferriss: very much so", " nick kokonas: because i knew people in bands that would get signed to a record label back in the day, and they would get a quarter million dollar advance", "shit", "that seems like a lot of money, right", "then all of a sudden, all your studio time comes out of that, and you don\u2019t recoup another dime until you\u2019ve sold x number of records or cds or, in this case, books", "then in the contract, it actually said, and the restaurant guarantees that they will buy 2,500 books at half of retail price", "i was like, whoa", "you\u2019re looking at something like $80,000 right there", "that goes right back to them, in essence", "then i went like, \u201cwell, i wonder what a book costs to print?\u201d  i asked them, \u201chow much is this book going to cost to print?\u201d \u201cwell, i don\u2019t really know.\u201d so what they would do is they would always have layers of people, so they said, \u201cthat\u2019s not what i do", "i am the person that does this", "the lawyer gives the contract", "the printer does the printing.\u201d  tim ferriss: there\u2019s always a plausible deniability or a plausible ignorance", " nick kokonas: yes", "willful, plausible ignorance", "and so i do what i start doing", "well, let\u2019s just google that up and see what it costs to print a book", "or, \u201chey, how many copies of the french laundry books sold", "how many copies of 50 other books that we wanted to emulate or that we thought were well done sold?\u201d man, it\u2019s like asking for keys to the vatican or something when you call a publisher and ask them that", "i\u2019m sure you know this, right", "you probably know now because you\u2019ve been so entrenched in the industry", "you know your numbers, and you might know that of some of your colleagues and friends, right", "but if you wanted to actually do a meaningful comparison across the industry, it\u2019s almost impossible to do it, even though there\u2019s a company that does that", " then you start trying to reverse engineer it and you go to the new york times", "you can go to the new york times website and just look at how is the new york times best seller created", "on their own site, they say it\u2019s a compendium of known publishers, like publishing houses, as well as these top 50 retailers, back in the day", "it\u2019s a gameable system", "the way that the publishers want to do it is that they want to ship out all the books at the same time, because that\u2019s how they\u2019re counted for the new york times best seller list and stuff", " tim ferriss: i should also note it\u2019s not only gameable, but it\u2019s also conversely highly subjective within the new york times", "so there\u2019s a lot of wiggle room", "in other words, it is not like the olympics, where clear gold, silver, bronze video replay", "we know exactly how this was tabulated", " nick kokonas: yeah, so the more that we dug, the more we got more and more curious, and a little bit angry, actually", "but grant was weirdly angry at me, because he\u2019s going like, \u201cdude, why do you care", "i\u2019ve been wanting this since i was 15.\u201d i was like, \u201cwell, look, if this is our budget, it\u2019s not going to be the book you want", "it\u2019s not going to be as good as you want it to be because we\u2019re not going to be able to spend six months doing the photography", "we\u2019re not going to be able to get great pages", "we\u2019re not going to be able to get a picture of every dish.\u201d what do people cook in a cookbook", "well, they tend to cook those pages where they see a picture of the final dish", "because you know what", "it looks delicious", "you know what it\u2019s supposed to look like", "you\u2019ve got something to emulate at least", " when we did the specs for the book, i had one of the best publishers in america say, \u201cif you do that book, there\u2019s no way you sell more than 5,000 of them", "no way", "no one\u2019s going to publish it", "you can\u2019t use metric", "you can\u2019t use a gram scale", "you can\u2019t have that font", "you can\u2019t have those pictures in full bleed", "and it\u2019ll cost way too much to print.\u201d and so it took about a month and a half before i got lucky and i called a print broker, who had actually brokered the print job of one of the famous books", "i was expecting that if the book retailed for $60, it would cost like $15 to print, $20", "i didn\u2019t know anything about it", "when he told me it was like $2.23 per book to print per a 30,000 copy run, i went, \u201cno way,\u201d like that", "he\u2019s like, \u201cwell, it\u2019s probably less now.\u201d like, he thought i meant it was too much", " instantaneously, i went, \u201coh, shit", "everything makes sense.\u201d when i would call publishers and tell them this, they would go \u201coh, yeah, but look", "we did 40 different books last year", "only five of them did well.\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cthat\u2019s your problem, man", "i know we\u2019re going to sell well", "i don\u2019t really give a shit if you lost 35 percent of the time, and you need to spread your portfolio risk", "i\u2019m the one you\u2019re spreading it on.\u201d we decided with the alinea book, we put together like 20 pages, and martin made this beautiful, stainless steel bracketing system, and we shipped it out to eight different publishers we like", "two of which were art houses that had never done a cookbook", "they all came back and said all the usual criticism, except aaron wehner at ten speed press", " tim ferriss: smart guy, by the way", " nick kokonas: he basically said, \u201ci\u2019m going to make you an unusual offer", "no advance at all", "we can negotiate", "essentially, we\u2019ll just be the distributor", "we\u2019ll negotiate out what that looks like, and we\u2019ll help you with the printing, and we\u2019ll help you with the editing, which we\u2019re both really good at.\u201d within 10 minutes, we had struck a deal whereby any of the books that we bought or sold for ourselves for our restaurant, we paid actual printing cost", "not wholesale, actual printing cost", "anything that they sold and distributed through their channels, they would get about 27% of the sale price, which means that we got 73% of that", "these are state secrets", "nobody tells this stuff", " for years, i was walking around with this knowledge where if we sold 100,000 books, that would be the equivalent of selling like 500,000 books on any other deal", "and we got to control the quality of it", "we won both the james beard award for best cooking from a professional point of view, best cookbook of the year", "we won, i say we, martin and laura kastner, won the communication arts award", "where if you\u2019re a designer, their annual is like getting the oscar", " tim ferriss: similarly, for people who don\u2019t know it, the james beard awards are also very much like the oscars", " nick kokonas: yeah", "so, we felt really vindicated on that", "the book still sells", "this is eight years later", "we still sell 7,000 to 8,000 copies a year", "when we did the aviary, which is our bar that\u2019s a non-bar that we talked about earlier, we started getting all of the same offers again", "this time, it was really easy to go, \u201cha, ha!\u201d just go, \u201coh, that\u2019s cute.\u201d i should add that grant and i wrote his memoir together that we didn\u2019t use a ghostwriter, we wrote it ourselves, called life, on the line", "that one, we did a traditional book deal, but after our agent got it halfway, i got on a plane and flew out there, and then brokered the deal myself", "i got a giant multiple of the highest bid by doing essentially a reverse dutch auction", "starting at a really high price and working my way downward", " tim ferriss: can you explain to people just briefly what that means", " nick kokonas: yeah, basically, i\u2019ll do this", "i think one of the great problems to solve, one of the black boxes, is the agency problem", "let\u2019s say you want to sell your house", "you put it on the market and the agent is going to get, i don\u2019t know, 4 to 5 percent of the sale price", "that\u2019s a lot for something that\u2019s your biggest investment in your life", "but they say, they control the information, they control the mls, and all that", "will they, if they\u2019re the seller\u2019s agent, get the highest price for you", "the answer is almost certainly not, because let\u2019s say a house is going to sell for $500,000; they\u2019re going to get 4 percent of that", "that\u2019s $20,000", "if they get $490,000, it\u2019s almost no different to them", "right", "$400 difference", "but if they lose the deal over that last $10,000, it\u2019s a lot", " so they want to price a home so that it sells quickly, so that they can keep their deal flow going", "they don\u2019t really care about maximizing their last dollar", "whereas for you, that last dollar is actually like $9,600", "it\u2019s a lot more money", "so what i do whenever i\u2019ve sold real estate is i figure out what the intrinsic value is of the house", "what\u2019s the bare minimum that i\u2019d be willing to sell it for", "i price it just slightly higher than that, and i tell all the agents in the whole town, \u201ci will pay you 50 percent of everything over 10 percent higher than that.\u201d they all say, \u201cthat\u2019s against the real estate ethics code,\u201d or, \u201ci would never do that deal because it would subvert all of my other deals\u201d or whatever", "then what happens is two days later, you get a dozen phone calls and they\u2019ve priced it 40 percent higher and it sells in two days", "because now they\u2019re actually working for you", " well, similarly, i went into that publishing negotiation and i was like \u2014 by the way, the agent is probably lookup-able", "she\u2019s a great person", "i don\u2019t think she even knows that\u2019s what was happening, you know what i mean", "she was brought up in this industry for this company, and that\u2019s the way it works", "she would for sure dispute everything i just said", "she would say, \u201ci always try to get the highest price.\u201d but i went in and i was like, \u201clook, i\u2019m not going to spend my time doing this for x", "so i need four times that.\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cthere\u2019s no way you\u2019ll ever get that", "you\u2019ve never written a book before.\u201d i said, \u201cwell, we did the alinea book.\u201d \u201cyeah, it\u2019s cookbook", "it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d these are words", "so i went to the publishers that all bid on it, and i just got them all on a conference call and just started at a really high price", "every couple seconds, i went down $10,000", "then one of them blinked and bought it", " that\u2019s a great method of price discovery", "if you think about it, most auctions, even if you go to a charity event or whatever, they start low and they try to get interest going high", "it\u2019s often the case that if they start really high and start going down, people start going \u201coh, my god, someone\u2019s going to say something", "like, i would pay that, someone else must as well.\u201d they could be off by a factor of 30 percent and they\u2019ll never even know it because there\u2019s only one bid that ever happens", "so no one knows how off they are", " tim ferriss: on that phone call, were you like, \u201chey, guys, i would love to get you on the phone,\u201d and then publisher a \u2013 [crosstalk] nick kokonas: \u2013 right away", " tim ferriss: i guess my question is, did they know that they were signing up for a mexican standoff", "nick kokonas: yes, they did", "tim ferriss: oh, they did", "nick kokonas: i went and met with them all personally", " tim ferriss: you\u2019re like, \u201cjohn, i\u2019d love to get you on the phone\u201d then it\u2019s like, \u201call right, congratulations, guys.\u201d  nick kokonas: no, you can\u2019t ambush people to a mexican standoff", "you can\u2019t do that", "you could", "it might be fun, but i didn\u2019t do that", "i went and talked", "i created enticement", "i sold on my ability to actually do it", "it was a bit like doing the no phones with the software", "i was like, well, if i get a really big contract, i\u2019ll have to figure out how to write a book, and then there will be a lot of pressure", "so i did that and i wrote it and i turned it on time, which apparently no one does", " tim ferriss: very rare", " nick kokonas: i sent it to them on the day it was due", "they went, \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d i went, \u201cthat\u2019s the manuscript.\u201d they went, \u201coh, that\u2019s cute.\u201d  tim ferriss: it\u2019s kind of like showing up at the restaurant on time as a diner and then being seated at the appointed time", " nick kokonas: apparently very rare", "tim ferriss: it\u2019s just this open line", " nick kokonas: do you turn your books in on time", "tim ferriss: i do, actually", " nick kokonas: i believe that", "tim ferriss: i do turn my books in on time and we could get into that a separate time", " nick kokonas: i just wanted to ask you a question", " tim ferriss: i do", "i do not turn them in at the expected length", "but i do \u2013 nick kokonas: a little longer perhaps", " tim ferriss: i do tend to turn them in on time", " nick kokonas: i do believe that", "what happened with the aviary is we basically couldn\u2019t figure out how to do another book, because the alinea book was such a project, and martin was on to other things", "we didn\u2019t want to do it traditionally", "i didn\u2019t know anyone who could do what we wanted to do", "then there was this guy, allen hemberger", "if you get nothing else from this whole talk and you\u2019ve made it this far, go google allen and alinea", "allen is a procedural effects artist", "he worked at weta studios on all the hobbit movies doing things like hair and water and things like that", "he writes the physics that then makes the magic", "he worked at pixar", " while he was at pixar, and his wife, sarah, worked an industrial light and magic as the graphics designer, he was given by sarah a copy of the alinea book, to go full circle", "he became fascinated with it", "he was not a cook", "he didn\u2019t know how to cook", "he did the julie & julia thing", "he spent five years not only cooking his way through the entire book, but also would do things like \u201cwell, i don\u2019t know where to get this plate, and i\u2019ve always wanted to learn how to fire porcelain.\u201d  tim ferriss: allen, for people wondering, is a-l-l-e-n", "there are also videos of allen and alinea", "he\u2019s an autodidact", "this guy learns and learns and learns", "he is the kind of person that goes to the black box and goes, \u201ci\u2019m going to learn how to forge knives, and i\u2019m going to learn how to fire porcelain", "by the way, i\u2019m going to cook everything in there and i\u2019m going to make pictures of it, and i\u2019m going to make a book documenting that.\u201d when he asked if he could use \u2013 we had a little email relationship, and he came up to alinea once to ask grant some questions about how to make something because it wasn\u2019t working", "when grant threw up his arms and goes, \u201cwell, the book might be wrong,\u201d allen\u2019s world view was shattered", "he was like, \u201cwhat do you mean it could be wrong?\u201d he goes, \u201cwell, we did have some errata in there", "we documented hundreds of recipes", "it could be wrong.\u201d  at that point, his mentality changed", "it\u2019s in the video", "we got to know him and i got to know him", "when he sent me the book, it wasn\u2019t what i was expecting", "i was expecting a homegrown book", "what i got was a 400-page, beautifully illustrated, beautifully written book about a person\u2019s journey of learning", "it was called the alinea project", "i had no idea that he had done anything like this", "suddenly, i thought to myself immediately, and it\u2019s in the intro to the aviary book, i texted him and said, \u201choly shit, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d and i have ideas", "after waiting for like four or five years to do a book on the aviary, i immediately was like, \u201cthis is the guy to do the book", "now i need to lure him out of pixar,\u201d which is about the best place to work in the world", "then i found out his wife worked at industrial light and magic and she did all the graphic design", "i was like, \u201cthis is perfect", "you guys need to quit your jobs and move to chicago.\u201d  they flew out", "we had some conversations about what that might look like", "it was very much a partnership", "they would have equity in the book", "we would have creative freedom to do it exactly the way we wanted", "we knew more about the printing and the bidding and all that, so i wasn\u2019t worried about the economics of it anymore", "i was worried about trying to make something really awesome", "right as they were about to say yes, they found out that they were going to have a baby", "so they called me up one day and said, \u201coh, my god.\u201d i was like, \u201coh, they got cold feet.\u201d oh, no", "they said, \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant", "we\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d i said, \u201cokay, well, we\u2019re going to wait a year, because there\u2019s no way in the world i\u2019m letting you move out of your comfort zone, and have a child, and have that change of life.\u201d  they thought i was punting on them just because \u2014 in a discriminatory way", "i said, \u201cno, we\u2019re not going to do this with anyone else", "we will wait as long as it takes.\u201d about a year and a half later, they moved to chicago", "we spent the last year and a half, set up a studio of our own", "spent the last year and a half doing this book", "did a kickstarter to just essentially raise awareness for it", "we raised almost a half million dollars in the kickstarter", "we\u2019ve sold about another $300,000 of books since then", "it comes out in october", "you can go to thealineabook.com", "the coolest part of that website is that if you look at \u2013 tim ferriss: it\u2019s thealineabook", "nick kokonas: i\u2019ll show you", "theaviarybook.com", "\u201cbury the lede, nick, bury the lede.\u201d genius marketing right there", "yeah, theaviarybook.com", "but the coolest part of that is, other than your ability to buy said book, is allen kept a blog on there called our progress", "in it, he details every single aspect of what it takes to make a book like this", "right down to line screens and compositing photos", "one of the things that every single book publisher told me is that you can\u2019t sell a cocktail book for more than $30", "there\u2019s no market for it", "and you don\u2019t need pictures, because it\u2019s just liquid in a glass", "i think we blew that out of the water with what the book looks like", " i think that because certain things like fire are really hard to photograph, there\u2019s this great picture in there of this one cocktail where we spray some anise and we light it on fire and it creates an aroma into the bowl that it\u2019s served it", "it\u2019s called \u201cloaded to the gun walls.\u201d it\u2019s a batavia rock cocktail", "that took a composite of 18 different photographs", "so he breaks down the photography techniques", "also, the new york times best seller list", "i showed him how google target marketing works and facebook ads work and all that", "all of a sudden, he went, \u201choly shit, i had no idea you could do this.\u201d we are going completely without a distributor or a publisher at this time", "i think we\u2019re going to set a, man, i don\u2019t know", "i\u2019m either completely delusional", "it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we sold a half million of these in the next two or three years", " tim ferriss: yeah, it\u2019s not a $9.95 book either, which it shouldn\u2019t be", " nick kokonas: no, it\u2019s $85", "we\u2019ve invested close to a million, all the way in, around it", "it looks like, i think, i hope", " tim ferriss: from what i\u2019ve seen, it looks like it would cost more than that", " nick kokonas: we did it all ourselves, too", "it\u2019s really like a five-person project", "it\u2019s deep enough that if a professional gets it, they\u2019re going to learn a lot", "but i\u2019d say about 35 to 40 percent of it can be done at home because unlike the alinea book where you\u2019ve got to go out and buy duck and your local grocery might not have this kind of duck or whatever, if you need some flor de cana rum or a certain kind of tequila or whatever, you just go to your local liquor store, and it\u2019s exactly the same thing that we use", "that product is universal", " tim ferriss: i read somewhere \u2013 i don\u2019t think this is taking us too far afield \u2013 i read somewhere that you consider yourself a tequila guy", "or at least in part a tequila guy", "do you have any favorite tequilas or concoctions", " nick kokonas: i\u2019m going to do a little video promo for the book that we just filmed last week, where essentially i work with eric jeffus, who\u2019s one of our bartenders in the office, which is our little speakeasy below the aviary", " tim ferriss: which is amazing", "if people have the opportunity, they should check it out", "nick kokonas: it\u2019s basically grant just said, \u201chey, everything upstairs, people are going to think it\u2019s alinea smoke-and-mirrors", "we need to prove we can make a real cocktail.\u201d so one of the foundational cocktails for me is a daiquiri", "it\u2019s three ingredients and a million ways to fuck it up", "it\u2019s just lime, sugar, and rum", "that\u2019s all it is", "and yet most bars you go into will make a terrible daiquiri", "or they\u2019ll blend it or blah, blah, blah", "but a great daiquiri is really, really transformative", "so i did a video on that", "then i always make a mezcal margarita", "that\u2019s my favorite drink", "all i\u2019m doing is i\u2019m taking some reposado and a little bit of mezcal in equal weights, along with some grand marnier or cointreau equivalent, and lime and simple syrup", "that\u2019s it", "that\u2019s all there is to it", "man, i love simple stuff like that", " then we have a whole section in the book on old whiskeys, dusty bottles, old gins", "there\u2019s a growing movement to rediscover some of the distilleries in america that were really, really great that don\u2019t exist anymore, that were more artisanal at the time", "you can still find those bottles around", "it\u2019s a little bit easier than someone wine collecting or something like that", "man, it\u2019s like an endlessly fascinating thing", "i didn\u2019t consider myself a cocktail person 10 years ago", "i really loved wine", "i felt like from a health perspective it was better as well", " but just like anything else, if you have a well-constructed cocktail, something of high quality, it\u2019s an additive thing", "you can have it in a meal, and it can make the meal better", "whereas a vodka tonic is just boozing", "it\u2019s just getting drunk", "that\u2019s not what we\u2019re trying to do here", "we\u2019re trying to make things that are \u2013 it\u2019s really a culinary approach to cocktails", "man, it\u2019s endlessly fascinating, just like anything else in this world", " tim ferriss: i would also say, just contrasting say someone who wants to recreate something from alinea, which you certainly could do, i mean, allen proved that, with something from the aviary, there is also a tremendous amount of theater and presentation dynamism that you can create with cocktails that does not have to be super expensive or super complicated, that certainly you guys are able to go as complex as you want to go, which is stunning, and i\u2019ve spent time at the aviary", " nick kokonas: you could easily make some ice with peychaud\u2019s bitters in it or something like that, then as the ice melts in the cocktail, and it\u2019s going to look really cool, too", "doing some of these things at home is not hard", "i did a dinner party once where it was like a cocktail party", "i probably had 40 people at my house", "each room in my house had all of the ingredients for the cocktail, and then little instructions on how to make it themselves", "that took away the need for a bartender, because they\u2019re terrible anyway, anyone that you bring in, a caterer or something like that", "the other cool thing is that people got really into it", "they went, \u201coh, now i know how to make an old fashioned", "now i know how to make a manhattan.\u201d the one that i discovered at that party was a frisco sour", "i had like benedictine, whiskey, and lemon", "it was really delicious", "it can be more than just a strong cocktail", "it can be really delicate and interesting", " tim ferriss: people can learn all about this at theaviarybook.com", "is that right", "nick kokonas: that\u2019s right, yeah", " tim ferriss: well, nick, i have two rapid fire questions that are unrelated, and then i think we\u2019re going to bring this neat and tidy round 1 podcast to a close, but we\u2019ve talked about books", "everybody should not only check out the aviary book, but also, if they have a chance, go to the aviary", "it is tremendous", "you can also get some delicious bites and food, at least the last time i was there \u2013 nick kokonas: you still can", " tim ferriss: \u2013 at the aviary", "i hesitate to call it a workaround, but you guys have some very popular establishments", "if you want to sample the food, this is also a great way to do it", "the drinks are just incredible", "it\u2019s a real destination that makes a trip to chicago worth it in and of itself", "i would recommend not only checking out the book, but also checking out a lot of what you guys are up to", "aside from that, books you have gifted the most to other people", "outside of those that you have made yourself, what are the books that you have gifted the most to other people", " nick kokonas: i named one of them already", "fooled by randomness", "almost everyone in my office is forced to read that", "i\u2019ve definitely given that away", "boy, that\u2019s a tricky one because just like i said, i can\u2019t remember books very well", "but certainly probably no", "1 on a business side of things", "on the other side, i tend to give away what i would call vintage art books", "so, it\u2019s not a book people can buy, i\u2019m sorry to say, but occasionally i\u2019ll be at a used book store and i\u2019ll find some of these great old art books", "i buy a few of them and then when i want to thank someone for something, i send them that", " tim ferriss: peregrinations of an epicurean", "something like that", " nick kokonas: at the end of the day, when i want to give someone something, i try to make it something that, and i really want to make it a great gift, i try to get something that you can\u2019t buy", "so i bought an old typewriter, and when i write a thank you note, i type it up on the old typewriter", "it is the most confounding thing to people", "because they look at it and they go, \u201chow did you do that?\u201d i go, \u201con a 1922 typewriter.\u201d it\u2019s like a personal, artisanal thing", "i know that\u2019s not what you\u2019re getting at", "i can\u2019t think of the number one", "i\u2019m sure once we end this, i\u2019ll immediately think of it", "if i do, i\u2019ll send it to you so you can link to it", " tim ferriss: i think the answer is more interesting with the typewriter", "i think what i\u2019m getting at is whatever \u00a0you just offered", "that\u2019s perfect", "if you come up with anything else, we can put it in the show notes", "this next one can be tough at times for folks", "so the billboard question", "so, metaphorically speaking, non-commercial, no advertising, but if you could get a word, a quote, a sentence, a question, up on a billboard to transmit something to millions or billions of people, does anything come to mind that you might put on that billboard", "nick kokonas: i don\u2019t know why this came to mind, but the word would be \u201cpause.\u201d that\u2019s it", "i have no idea why that came to mind", "i think in talking through this whole thing, you kept asking me: \u201cwhy are you digging this black box\u201d or whatever", "or it would be like curiosity", "i thinking of those in the same way", "i\u2019m not saying \u201cpause\u201d like \u201cstop.\u201d i\u2019m saying \u201cthink.\u201d i think the hallmark of the people that i like as friends the best is what we try to instill in our kids, and the reason that i like my wife so much and all that, is that intellectual curiosity is everything", "i don\u2019t know, how do you get that on a billboard", "i think \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cbe curious\u201d or something like that", "i know it\u2019s clich\u00e9", "i think that\u2019s the thread that ties everything together", " tim ferriss: yeah", "you do pause a lot", "even though on a macro level you seem to be moving at hyperspeed a lot of the time, there are a lot of pauses built into that speed, if that makes sense from what i\u2019ve noticed", "you are simultaneously one of the craziest fuckers i have know, and least craziest fuckers i know, if that makes \u2013 nick kokonas: well that\u2019s a great compliment", "thank you", "i\u2019ll take it", " tim ferriss: where can people find you", "i know you have, of course, thealineagroup.com", "you have exploretock.com", "theaviarybook.com, which is sort of the most timely for people to check out right now", "if people want to say hello or follow you on social, where are the best places, the best handles for that", "nick kokonas: instagram, which is @nkokonas, k-o-k-o-n-a-s", "and twitter is @nickkokonas, n-i-c-k", "hey it\u2019s all google-able", "if you can figure out my email address, i\u2019ll probably answer", "although, given the reach of your podcast, perhaps i will be inundated; it might take a while", "tim ferriss: yeah, that might be a hug of death situation", "but we will tbd", "nick kokonas: that\u2019s okay", "good problem to have, i suppose", "tim ferriss: good problem to have", "nick, this was a blast", "thank you so much for taking the time", "i really appreciate it", " nick kokonas: thank you, tim", " tim ferriss: many more conversations to be had", "i think another trip to chicago may be in order soon", " nick kokonas: i was going to say, i hope we see you here soon", " tim ferriss: i know", "i need to get back", "to everybody listening, we\u2019ve made mention of the show notes, links to everything we\u2019ve discussed, which you will be able to find at tim.blog/podcast, as with this episode and certainly every other episode", "until next time, thank you so much for listening"]}
