[intro]   tim ferriss: what's up, my little munchkins. this is tim ferriss. welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show.   i've been waiting to record this intro and this goddamn garbage truck keeps backing up so fuck it, we're going to roll with it make it part of the ambiance. the tim ferriss show is where i attempt to deconstruct world class performers, whether they are chess prodigies, hedge fund managers, athletes, artists, comedians, celebrities, actors, you name it, scientists; we dig into everythingand the reason is you find that there are, say, morning routinesthere are meditative practices. there are types of nutrition and training that transfer across all of these domains   it's pretty amazing that you find a common tool kit for excellenceand in this episode, we have jimmy chin. i remember at one point, jimmy was kind of introduced to me conceptually by someone who said if chase jarvis, the world class photographer, and laird hamilton, arguably the biggest big wave surfer of all time - did i say biggest? the best big wave surfer of all time - had a love child, it would be jimmy.   and i was like, what the hell does that mean? jimmy is an artist and a professional athlete, often at the same time. as a nat geo -!national geographic - photographer, he has participated in and documented breakthrough expeditions around the planet from climbing first descents in the karakoram to skiing first descents in the himalayas. put another way, he is one of the few people to both climb everest to the summit and then ski it down from the summit, which is bonkers. most recently, he filmed and directed an incredible feature documentary called meru, m-e-r-u, which is in theaters right now and won the 2015 audience award at sundance   so what is meru? i'll put this in perspective for folks. in the high stakes game of big wall climbing, the shark's fin on mount meru is, i suppose, the ultimate prize. everest is a cakewalk by comparison. sitting at the headwaters of the ganges river in northern india, the shark's fin has seen more failed attempts by elite climbing teams - the best of the best - over the past 30 years than any other ascent in the himalayas. or the \"himalias,\" as they say.   this movie is a story of one group's journey to conquer it. there are many mishaps along the way. it's a white-knuckle quest of friendship, sacrifice, hope and obsession. how the hell jimmy captured it on film while simultaneously risking his life is impossible for me to fathom, but we dig into it. so in this episode of the podcast, we talked about his origins, training, nutrition, gear, and tackling meru, of course, which just really blows my mindand i don't say that lightly   so suffice it to say, if you want a benevolent kick in the ass, go see meru. that's your assignment. i saw it with my family and for probably 15 minutes afterwards, all they could say was \"whoa, whoa,\" over and over again. my refrain was, \"holy shit,\" under my breath, muttering 20 times every hour. it's really mind boggling what jimmy pulls off.   it's amazing, terrifying and awe inspiring, and inspiring at the same time. so without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with the incredible jimmy chin.  tim ferriss: jimmy, welcome to the show.  jimmy chin: thank you. nice to be here.  tim ferriss: it's really been an interview that i've struggled with how to tacklebecause when i watched - is it merru or meru? i don't know how to emphasize the name of this.  jimmy chin: i say meru.  tim ferriss: meru. it was basically 90 minutes of saying, \"oh, my fucking god, oh, my fucking god.\" so i feel like most of the questions that i would have formulated during that time might have been high jacked. but we're going to, of course, talk about that and many other things. but when you are asked by people what do you do, how do you answer that? because you have been described by a friend of mine as the love child, if there were one, of laird hamilton and chase jarvis, which i thought was hilarious.   both have been on the podcast, both amazing, world-class performers in surfing with laird, and many other things, and then photography with chase. and i don't want the image in my head of them actually doing anything sexual but how do you answer the question, what do yo do, because you do so much?  jimmy chin: sorry, i was picturing something terrifying, actually.  tim ferriss: i feel like chase would really get the worse end of that.  jimmy chin: that's a question i get asked often. it's kind of amazing that i still don't have a very good answer for it. i generally break it down into three pieces. i'm a professional athlete, i am a photographer, and i'm a filmmaker.    that's kind of divided by my sources of income. so i guess that's the best way that i can describe what i do. an athlete kind of entails everything from corporate speaking to endorsement of product or a brand ambassador, or working rd&d with designers, jackets. so they kind of spread through a lot of different areas when i say athlete.   and then photographer is both commercial and editorial work, and filmmaker is kind of the same; documentary filmmaking and commercial work, as well.  tim ferriss: for those people who may not be familiar with your work, what would the jimmy chin highlight real look like? when you're introduced by a friend at a party who's had a couple of drinks and so is very enthusiastic, when they want to really catch someone's attention with some of your accomplishments, what are the things that hey throw out? jimmy chin: you mean flattering ones or unflattering?  tim ferriss: that's true. they're like hey, this is my friend jimmy. one of my buddies does, as a side note; he's from new zealand so he loves doing this to people. he'll run up to me at parties when i'm talking to someone i want to make a good first impression on. and he'll go, \"hey, buddy, how's the syphilis going? anyway, sorry to interrupt.\" and then he'll run off. i'm referring less to that type of shenanigan and more to the flattering stuff, when he wants to impress someone.  jimmy chin: i think it would be, \"hey, this is jimmy. he's a national geographic photographer. he's climbed and skied everest and he just recently won the audience award for his film at sundance.\" that would probably be the quick and dirty.  tim ferriss: the quick and dirty top three? what is a first ascent and what is a first descent in climbing and skiing, respectively?   because you've done both. is that right?  jimmy chin: yes. to give it some context, those are the descriptions of what professional climbers and skiers or snowboarders do. because really, when you're a professional climber or a professional skier, you often are trying to do firsts; things that have never been done before. you make a career of trying to do first ascents or first descents. that's really kind of like your legacy, toofor instance, if i show up at a mountain range, the karakoram in pakistan, and i go to the trango towers, which is this beautiful range of big, alpine walls in pakistan, i can look at the mountains and i'll see these prominent lines.   you'll either have a guidebook or you'll be with somebody who can point out these lines and say that prow on the great trango, first descent by so-and-so, mark synnott and alex lowe. so it's kind of like your legacy. but it's also your inspiration, too, in a lot of ways. and then if you're a skier, you can go up to alaska and you'll see this big, intimidating lines and they're related to somebody   doug coombs, one of the great skiers of our generation, he did the first descent. and they're important because they represent a person's legacy in a way, but they also inspired somebody. they had to have a vision to do it. because usually, each generation, you're trying to push the boundaries of what's possible by doing these certain lines. and of course, they get harder and harder, generation after generation.  tim ferriss: where am i reaching you right now? where are you in the world?  jimmy chin: i just got back home in jackson hole, wyoming.  tim ferriss: you have a very busy schedule ahead of you. but if you're looking back retrospectively - i suppose it's redundant but you get the idea - at your three silos, and they're not really silos because they're so intertwined, the photography, the athletics, the climbing and alpine sport and then the filmmaking, if you could only be remembered for one of those three, which would you choose and why?  jimmy chin: oh, boy. that's a tough one. i don't even know if i can answer that because they're so important to me. there are crossovers within the communities, and i'm not trying totally dodge the question. but my peer group, i think of my peer group when you ask me that question.   there are so many people who i respect and appreciate in each category, i guess you could say. they're all equally important and inspiring to me. so i guess that is the answer, that there isn't one that i would prefer to be remembered by, or i'd love to be remembered by all of them.  tim ferriss: let me rephrase that. if you had to stop doing one of them, gun against the head, had to choose one, which would it be?  jimmy chin: oh, you're making this tough.  tim ferriss: yeah, and there's a lot more where that came from.  jimmy chin: yeah, i'm sure there is. you know, i would probably choose - oh, man   climbing and skiing have provided so much inspiration for the other two and the passion for the other two in a lot of ways were rooted in being in the wild, the experiences that i had and have in the mountains, and in the ocean surfing. i'm a pretty physical person and i just find such great joy in doing those things. okay. i guess i'll say the climbing and the skiing and the surfing; the athletics. that's what i'd pick.  tim ferriss: that's what you'd pick to keep?jimmy chin: that's what i'd pick to keep.  tim ferriss: let's talk about the physical side of things because i know the people listening are very interested in your training regimens and things like that. we're going to rewind the clock at one point and talk about your upbringing and background a bit. a mutual friend of ours sent me this paragraph, and i'd love to dig into it a little bit.   \"his training regimen is alien. example, to our car to car ski lapse on the grant teton, question mark, exclamation point, question mark.\" so i want to come back to that because i'm not sure what that is. \"he'd be in town having a coffee after a grand lap by mid morningexum guides\" - i don't know what that is - \"in jackson hole list this as a two day ascent, and many would consider it the seminole achievement of their mountaineering life. it's a standard workout for him.\"   i want to drill into this, exactly. what is a tour hour car to car ski lap?  jimmy chin: i think the hours are probably wrong. i've never done it in two hours, car to car, and i don't think anybody has. but i have done certainly a sub-ten, maybe even around six hours; i can't remember. i'm not one of those people that records my time every single time i go up and do something. i have a general sense, and it's more just for me to gauge where my fitness is at.   a car to car time, let's say it's six to eight hours, somewhere in there, is basically you start in the valley floor and if you did start a stopwatch, you'd start it when you left the car. then you'd climb up the grand, and you'd ski back down to the car and then you'd stop the clock. so car to car, i think one of the times that has been kind of recognized was when i was training to ski everest, i was kind of doing laps on the grand. i would do it a few times a weekat one point towards the end when i was really fit, i climbed and skied the grand, and then went over and skied the middle, and then went over and climbed and skied the south teton back to the car in i think it was sub-ten hours   i can't remember exactly but something like that. for me to think about it now, even, i'm like wow, that's pretty fast because i don't think i could do that right now. and could i do it again at some point? maybe. but yeah, that's how i trained. i do have to train in the gym now probably more than i ever had to before. and i don't particularly love it because the whole point for me was being in the mountains, and i didn't necessarily consider it just training because i got to be in the mountains, and i got to climb and ski and breathe and push myself, and look at the starry sky early in the morning or watch the sun rise. there's so much beauty in that. when i'm in a gym, it feels a little lacking. but i have to do it now more.   tim ferriss: is that a function of age, or what is the reason you have to spend more time in the gym?  jimmy chin: some people who i've seen in their kind of arc, in their career arc as a professional alpinist or ski mountaineer, they've moved more into the gym because there's less exposure to risks. it is kind of a statistics game; the more time you're out there, the more risk you're exposed to and it catches up to you. so there is that partfor me, that's not necessarily the case. it's more the fact that i'm traveling a ton. i'm married to my wonderful wife who lives in manhattan and you just don't get those full days. and to get in the mountains, you have to wait for the right conditions, too. if it's stormy, you can't just go. you kind of have to wait.    and i don't have that luxury. it's like okay, i have to train. i have to have a certain amount of consistency to stay in shape.  tim ferriss: what does your week of exercise look like currently? and let's separate that from launch time with the new film, and so on, and just think about a non crunch period like that. although i think you probably have a lot of crunch times, from the looks of it. but assuming that you're in wyoming, what does a week of training look like for you? and the more specific the better because i love it and i know the people listening would really enjoy it.  jimmy chin: it's hard for me not to think - and maybe this will be helpful to you. i can think about what it used to look like in my mid to late 20s when i could just go, and then also right now. but right now, a week at home, i'll usually set aside two full days, if i'm home for seven days.   so two of the seven days, i'll set aside for full days. and one full day, depending on the season, would be to go on - if it's the winter - a huge ski tour or climbing and skiing one of the peaks in the tetons as one of my big days. in the winter, it would be two of those. it would be ski something big in the grand, teton national park and then another big, full day skiing back country at the resort or ski touring up on teton pass, which is this great back country ski accessed area. and then the five days in between, i'd probably be working most of the day. i would just get like one or two laps on the pass, which is an approximately 1,500 foot hike and then ski down.   and i would probably do that once or twice, if i had a little bit more time in the afternoon. i'd probably throw in some yoga once or twice a week, or just some stretching once or twice a week, as well.  tim ferriss: what type of gym work would you be doing in that week? or would you not be doing much gym work?  jimmy chin: i probably wouldn't be doing much gym work. it seems like in the summertime, there's probably a chance i would do two days in the gym, which would probably be core stuff. it would probably be core and yoga of some sort.  tim ferriss: when you say core, to get really specific, how long are those workouts and what might a hypothetical or real sequence of exercises look like for you?  jimmy chin: probably, if i'm lucky and i have somebody that i'm training with who will run me through a workout, there's sand bag getups\u00e9  tim ferriss: like a turkish getup using a sandbag or different?  jimmy chin: exactly. it's like turkish sandbags.  tim ferriss: are you doing that with one arm? it's just one of those sandbags with the handles on them?  jimmy chin: yeah, and you throw it over your shoulder.  tim ferriss: ah, so it's a getup with a sandbag on your shoulder. that sounds miserable.  jimmy chin: exactly. it's not that much fun.  tim ferriss: what type of rep set scheme are you doing with that?  jimmy chin: it depends. i think i'd probably be doing a 60 pound sandbag, and i think it's like 5 to 10 on each side. and then i would go to do a series of sit-ups or some sort of leg lifts or something like that, or you're hanging off of something and doing leg lifts and then planks, essentially. kind of three core workouts back to back and you do a whole round of them.tim ferriss: got it.   so you do a sandbag getup, some type of leg lift, plank, and then repeat that sequence?  jimmy chin: yeah. and in the winter, if there's a climbing station where there's a wall there to hang off of, i'll do a core workout and then i'll just get on an overhanging wall for four or five minutes and just work out my arms, just so i keep some semblance of my climbing capacity. and really that's one of the hardest things for me. i'm supposed to be a climber, and most of the serious professional climbers, they just climb year round. and most of the skiers ski year round. so they go to south america and ski during our summers. but i'm kind of switching back and forth and they don't complement each other that well.   because skiers get these huge legs, and that's like the worst if you're a rock climber.  tim ferriss: big, meaty thighs.  jimmy chin: exactly. obviously, really strong forearms and finger strength does nothing for your skiing. that's like a constant kind of battle.  tim ferriss: it's like being a bench press competitor and a competitive cyclist.  jimmy chin: something like that.  tim ferriss: not to say you're doing much bench pressing but the point being that yeah, the exercises do not necessarily transfer from one to the other. this is talked about in meru, which i enjoyed incredibly; i recommended it to 500,000 people or so via this newsletter that i send out every friday called five bullet friday. i found it extremely inspiring but i want to talk specifically about - it's not really a biathlon; it's kind of like a triathlon but in an unconventional sense.   so meru, i guess it's the shark's fin, am i getting this right?  jimmy chin: yes, the shark's fin.  tim ferriss: the shark's fin has defeated some of the top climbers and alpinists for 20, 30 years because you can't just be good at big wall climbing. and please correct me if i'm wrong; i'm trying to give people who aren't familiar with this stuff some context. it's a big wall, you could think of, say, el capitan or some of these sheer surfaces in yosemite as a big wall. you can't just be a good big wall climber; you can't just be a good ice climber. you can't just be good at any one of the disciplines; you have to be world class at all of them.    and what i'd love to ask you is for instance, in the case of rock climbing, and when people think of an indoor gym or just climbing outside, bouldering or doing top climbing or lead climbing if they're more advanced, what are some common novice wastes of time or mistakes?   and i'm just going to kind of hit each of these disciplines for people who are eager to practice this stuff. if we look at rock climbing first, in your own development and looking back and knowing all the people you know, what should novices do more of and less of?  jimmy chin: i'd say in terms of technique, the classic mistake that climbers make when they first start is that they think it's all about having these big arms and upper body strengthand it's really actually about the footwork and balance, and keeping your weight over your feet. it's the classic scenario where you have the big, burly guy who's about to start climbing, and then the petite woman that is a little bit intimidated; there's a different attitude towards it.   and then the guy gets up there and is trying to muscle through this climb and use his big, burly shoulders that he's been building in the gym. and he can't get 20 feet off the ground. and then this small, petite woman who maybe did ballet or gymnastics gets up there and floats put the thing. and then the guy is totally destroyed, right, on multiple levels. you see that all the time. because the woman is a) being smart, and she isn't leaning towards muscle; it's more about how she stands on her feet and is just being much more thoughtful about how to climb this thing. i don't know if that necessarily answers your question.  tim ferriss: no, it's helpful. i've watched women in the gym and consistently the higher level climbers are better at keeping their arms straight and keeping their bodies over their feet, or at least using their feet to their advantage. if you were training someone in rock climbing, how would you have them practice for the first, say, two weeks? would it be on the bouldering wall? would they be doing top roping? would they be incorporating other things like slack lining? if you really wanted to lay a very, very good foundation, what would you focus on in those first two weeks?jimmy chin: i would probably get them on the bouldering wall just to get familiar with moving around and not being so caught up in the rope work and all of those things. and just getting that body movement, that muscle memory for just moving around on a vertical surface. the top roping, i would bring that in.   getting them confident with tying the knots so that they understand the systems. because so much of the fear that comes in climbing is often perceived and a lot of what you do as a climber is you're managing fear. and i often talk about managing fear by recognizing the difference between perceived risks and real risks   so when you teach somebody about these systems and they understand it, and they're like, oh this is a safety system, and this is how it works; you can help alleviate some of the fear of the climbing and the height. so i would just take them top roping and get them familiar with climbing a bit higher and using that technique that they've been learning on the bouldering wall, as well.  tim ferriss: let's talk about gear for a second, because i know people have asked me to ask you when you're in the gym or not doing cold weather stuff, when you're just working on climbing, what type of shoes do you wear?  jimmy chin: for normal rock climbing?  tim ferriss: yes.  jimmy chin: i guess it would just be climbing shoes. you mean what brand?  tim ferriss: yes.  jimmy chin: i normally climb in 510. they're known for having the best sticky rubber.  tim ferriss: any particular model?  jimmy chin: i've climbed a lot in the anasazis for more everyday climbing.  tim ferriss: and for back country skiing and ski touring, what type of gear do you use?  jimmy chin: i use dynafit boots and the dynafit bindings. and then skis, over the last few years usually i'm on armada skis or black diamond skis.  tim ferriss: when you're doing downhill, i would imagine the gear changes quite a bit but i don't know; it's outside my area of expertise.  jimmy chin: it's funny because i use a lot of different brands based on what boot they have.   i've skied lange boots and armada skis for many years. that's kind of like my on resort setup. that's the main.  tim ferriss: that's the go-to?  jimmy chin: yeah.  tim ferriss: when you're doing this training and doing laps of various types, and you're out there for five to ten hours, what does your nutrition look like, if anything? what are you bringing with you in terms of water and food?  jimmy chin: on bigger days in the mountains, this is non expedition but let's say i'm going up to climb and ski the grand or i'm doing a long run across the tetons or something in the summer. it's usually i have clif shots, clif blocks. i also use a lot of hammer nutrition stuff which i think triathletes and endurance athletes use. there's heed, which is a great carbohydrate drink hat isn't over flavored and pretty easy to use.   i like to have real food, as well so it's usually like a ham sandwich or pb&j or a couple of them. i also take endurolytes, which is basically an electrolyte pill that hammer nutrition makes. i bring a lot of life saver mints.  tim ferriss: life saver mints, why life savers?  jimmy chin: i don't know. they're like a little nicety to have when you're on a long run or a big day out. i have a terrible sweet tooth so it kind of helps with that, as well.  tim ferriss: do you bring life savers on your bigger expeditions, as well? like on meru, did you have a stash of life savers?  jimmy chin: absolutely.  tim ferriss: i noticed, of course, and a lot of people have noticed, that you have ear buds in a lot when you're climbing or, i would imagine, exercising.   when you're on these bigger expeditions, what are you listening to? and actually, justin boreta of the glitch mob wanted to ask this specifically  jimmy chin: no way.  tim ferriss: yeah, he's been on the podcast before. so he wanted to know what do you listen to, how do you use music when climbing, etc.? so i'd love to just hear what is in your ears?  jimmy chin: that is hilarious. well, a couple things. i don't usually climb, like when i'm actually leading or if i'm belaying, i'm not listening to an ear pod. but on expeditions, i definitely on the treks in where it's four or five days of trekking, i'll be listening to music. and yes, certainly sometimes when i'm bouldering or pouring up in the mountains to ski something i'll have them in. but when it gets real, like there's real climbing or real skiing happening, i definitely am not listening to music at that point.  tim ferriss: when you're trekking in, what are some favorites?  jimmy chin: it's funny [inaudible] who's amazing and i love the glitch mobwe definitely listened to the glitch mob on meru. and despite the weight limitations that we put on ourselves, we brought this teeny, little nano and a little micro speaker with a solar speaker. we had glitch mob on there.  tim ferriss: that's awesome.  jimmy chin: i've been a huge fan of them for a long time. we had everything from classic reggae, jose gonzalez, eddie vetter, and the classics, too, like led zeppelin and neil young. it's really across the boardi'll listen to bach. on these long trips, i usually have a pretty good mix of music.   glitch mob and jose gonzalez were definitely playing a lot on our meru expedition.  tim ferriss: when you look back at all of your experiences, and i'm sure you get approached by many - wanna be sounds bad - but aspiring mountaineers, and i apologize that i'm not sure if mountaineer is interchangeable with alpine climber or alpinist; i don't know the vocabibut for people who look at your life outdoors and envy that, and want to spend more time outside and want a goal of some type, let's just assume that they are mid-30s, used to be pretty athletic, maybe competed as an athlete, spend a lot of time sitting down but not to reverse that and need a goal of some type, what would be some decent goals to put on the calendar in terms of certain ascents or summits or anything like that? let's assume they don't have any real technical training to speak of at this point.  jimmy chin: i think there are a couple avenues to come into it. i think nols is a good way to come into it, the national outdoor leadership school based out of lander, wyoming. i think they have a few adult classes. another great way to come into it, of course, too if you're a professional and you want more one-on-one kind of instruction, i think the best way to do that is to come into it by hiring a guide. i think a great mini expedition for someone or a goal would be to climb the grand teton   because you come into it, you learn basics of rope work. you learn how to belay and you go climbing for a couple days down low so your comfortable with the rock climbing and the systems. and then you get to go up on the grand where it's a bit more alpine and higher altitude, and then you get to climb a mountain.   a lot of people, like a typical good client who's getting a lot out of the experience will have that climb under their belt and then the next year, they'll call a guide if they got along with them really well and had a good time and say hey, let's do something else? and that guide will probably come up with another really cool idea and maybe that's climbing a harder route on the grand or going into the wind river range. there are ways to kind of continue to progress as a climber. but then you also have the safety of this very knowledgeable guide.  tim ferriss: how would one go about finding a good guide? are there certain websites or resources that you would recommend?  jimmy chin: in jackson for climbing the grand, there are two outfits. one is exum mountain guides and the other one is jackson hole mountain guides   all of their guides have gone through courses and have definitely been in the mountains a lot. they'll assign one. most of the guys i know are great. so that's one way to go into it. you can also do this kind of thing in yosemite or in the sierras, as well. that's another place to go.  tim ferriss: i saw a great documentary called valley uprising, about the last whatever it is, 50 years in yosemite big wall climbing. it kind of traces everything from the very early days all the way up to alex honnald, right? is that how you say his last name?  jimmy chin: yeah.  tim ferriss: and a number of mutants like that. the question that i wanted to tackle next is going way, way back. where were you born and raised?  jimmy chin: i was born and raised in minnesota, mankato, minnesota.   it's basically this small farm town with a small university in it.  tim ferriss: had your parents been there for multiple generations?  jimmy chin: no, my parents were both from china. my mother was from harbin, on the north.  tim ferriss: i was just going to say they had to be from some cold ass place like harbin to go to minnesota.  jimmy chin: my mom was. she came from this really progressive family. my grandfather was trained in western medicine and a doctor, and my grandmother spoke multiple languages. she was pretty progressive for her time. she was apparently an actress in japanese cinema; i don't know how that worked out.  tim ferriss: wow, that's out there.  jimmy chin: yeah. so she came from that kind of a world. and then my father was from the south, in winso. he was from a really traditional, conservative, military family.   it's very unlikely that those two would have met in china. but in that era, both of their families left china during the communist revolution and ended up in taiwan. and then they both went to the united states and met in the states. they moved to chicago after they got married. didn't like the city and heard that minnesota was apparently a good place to raise a family, so they moved to minnesota and worked at the university in mankato. and that's where i was born.  tim ferriss: both of them worked at the university?  jimmy chin: yes.  tim ferriss: what did they do there?  jimmy chin: they were both librarians.  tim ferriss: that's fascinating. what were some defining moments in your childhood? when you think back to how you were raised and growing up in that environment, if you had to pick a defining moment in your childhood, what would one be?  jimmy chin: they were very kind of stereotypical chinese parents. they were very focused on academics and kind of these extracurricular activities. so i started playing the violin when i was 3 and a halfand i swam competitively from when i was 7 through high schoolthen i studied martial arts from as long as i can remember from my dad. so my mom was kind of like pushing the violin side; my dad was pushing the martial arts side and they both kind of agreed on the swimming part. but my life was consumed by these things because i was basically either practicing the violin, going to swim practice, or going to the dojo and competing every weekend.   i played in the youth orchestra, and i was studying a lot. so i was pushed pretty hard. i was also really motivated. i wanted to do well in these things. but they were a bit confining, in a way. so when i found skiing, there was a little ski hill behind my house and that was my reward if i did well in everything else. i still remember i skied in jeans and a jean jacket, froze my ass off, on this little bump.  tim ferriss: it was like the andre agassi of asian kids in minnesota.  jimmy chin: which i was like the only one, by the way, in mankato. there were not that many asian kids.  tim ferriss: you have your own small child now, am i right?  jimmy chin: yes.  tim ferriss: what are you going to do differently, if anything, in raising your child compared to your parents?   and that's not meant as a criticism of your parents. i'm just curious what you'll definitely borrow and what you think you'll do differently.  jimmy chin: i've been thinking about that a lot. i've really had to go against the grain. my parents were not into the fact that i finished college and decided i was going to go\u00e9  i discovered climbing, as well, late in high school and i was obsessed. i told them hey, i'm going to take a year off after college instead of looking for this new career i was supposed to go on. they really were: your three options are lawyer, doctor, executive. so when i told them i was going to live out of my car for a year, and the way i framed it was i've just got to get it out of my system and then i will pursue a power career somewhere.  tim ferriss: happily.  jimmy chin: one year turned into two, two turned into three. i lived out of the back of a little blue subaru for seven years until i was 28, climbing and skiing and doing odd jobs like shoveling roofs on mansions in jackson. we'd have to do rope work. i did random stuff to make it work. they were mortified. my mom would say, \"well, of course we're worried; there's no word in chinese for what you do. what are you doing?\" i couldn't imagine a different life because it was so powerful for me to do that. and it was tough.  i had a lot of doubt about it.   and it didn't help, obviously, that every time i called them, they were like, what are you doing? so what i took away from that, though, was that the foundation that they set for me in that sort of discipline, and even though it wasn't like i found the martial arts, i did eventually really love it. swimming, it was just i did love that physical aspect of competition and pushing as hard as you can and improving incrementally, and understanding what it takes to progress. playing the violin was incredible, and i'm so thankful that i picked up the guitar in college and it was really easy to pick up, and music has been a big part of my life   those aspects of my upbringing, while at points in my use i hated them but there's so much appreciation for it. they also raised me to speak bilingually. they would ignore me if i didn't speak to them in chinese. they knew i was going to learn english but at home it was only chinese. i got to grow up with another languagewhen i was younger, i was like, my parents are crazy; nobody else makes their kids do this stuff. but i really appreciated it   so i don't think i'll necessarily dictate you have to do this and this and this. i'm certainly going to share the things that i love with my daughter marina and if she enjoys them or becomes passionate\u00e9 and that could be photography, too. i'm going to share those things with her. i think i'll have the capacity to recognize whether or not she finds one of them really appealing.    in a lot of ways it's also selfish because i want to be able to ski with my daughter, and surf with my daughter. but i want her to find something she's passionate about. i've told myself this, and i don't know whether or not i'll be able to execute on it but to wrap my head around that it could be something totally different than what you expect and you're going to have to embrace it and give her all those opportunities that she needs to pursue whatever that thing is. and maybe it's knitting, who knows?  tim ferriss: my mom and dad did that with me quite a lot. they didn't have the same focus on music, although i took music lessons. i was a chronic quitter with music but they did expose me to a lot.   we didn't have a lot of money but i was constantly exposed to things outside, to different types of activities and they put whatever muscle they could behind helping my brother and me to explore those things. i'm really grateful for that. and i had a number of mentors, but this isn't about me. i want to ask you about your mentors, and i only know about a few of them. conrad anchor is in the film. if you're listening to this, you have to go see meru.    it's time extremely well spent and it's a beautiful film, and a terrifying film and, at points, a hilarious film. but i wanted to talk about and ask you about someone i'm less familiar with. we've mentioned photography but haven't really touched on your start, and i'm not familiar with it. so i was hoping you could maybe tell the story of meeting galen rowell?  jimmy chin: yeah, it's galen rowell.   tim ferriss: rowell, there we go. could you explain how you became exposed to photography and then how you met galen?  jimmy chin: i never studied photography; i didn't take any classes in photography. i actually had a friend who wanted to be a photographer show me how to use his camera while we were on a climb in yosemite. i took a photo with it and he was trying to sell his photos, which were slides at the time. he sold one photo and it happened to be mine, for $500.00. he still says, i started jimmy's career, which is true. he went on to do great things in his field, as well. it was so funny because in a way i'm embarrassed to say that i didn't come at photography from this inspiration of creativity and art.   i came at it from oh, i live out of my car; $500 i can live for basically two months. i'm like, man, i only have to take one photo a month and i could do this for the rest of my life. that was my 20-year-old self thinking. obviously, i've evolved from there   so i picked up photography then and was very fortunate to start shooting right away for commercial clients, just because my peer group were all these climbers like dean potter and seth davis and timmy o'neil and cedar [inaudible] and they all became famous climbers. i started shooting for patagonia and the north face right away because they wanted someone they didn't have to worry about when they were up climbing.   i could climb and i would shoot with themgalen came into my life when i started looking at a lot of different photography. he embodied this form of adventure photography that was very participatory. he was shooting from the inside out, as opposed to from the outside in.  tim ferriss: what do you mean by that?  jimmy chin: where he's part of the team and climbing, and he was a very talented and visionary climber. he has first ascents all over the world.  tim ferriss: got it. he was a peer with his subject matter.  jimmy chin: exactly. i related to that. at one point, i saw these photos of conrad and this other climber, peter kraft in pakistan in this unbelievable valley   and i was like, okay, that is the end gameif i'm going to commit to being a climber, and i'm going to be in yosemite, climbing el cap wasn't the end game. that was where you cut your teeth. you took what you learned in yosemite and you go to a place like this place in this picture; the high altitude, big walls of pakistan. so i'm like 24, maybe, 23 and i decide okay, the one guy who's going to know how to get there is this guy galen.   so i drove from wyoming to berkeley where is gallery was, and i showed up at his office.  tim ferriss: berkeley, california?  jimmy chin: yeah. i walk in the office, and the receptionist is there and she's like, can i help you? i'm like, yeah, i'm here to see galen. and she's like, and you are\u00e9? i'm like, well, i'm jimmy chin. she's like, okay. she goes upstairs. she comes back.   she's like, he just came back from this huge shoot and there's all these photo editors there; he doesn't have time to see you today. so i was like, well, that's cool; do you mind if i hang out and look around a bit? she's like, that's fine. so i sit in the lobby that day, the rest of the afternoon, kind of like moping around and looking at pictures. the place closes and i leave. i come back the next day and same thing. they're like, oh it's you again. i'm like, yeah, is he around? and they're like, not really   so basically i do the same thing on tuesday, do the same thing on wednesday, do the same thing on thursday and by then, they're kind of like: dude, what's your deal? and one of the guys there, a little bit younger, was like, man, what are you doing? and i'm like, i just want to meet him. i just need ten minutes of his time.    they were like, maybe come back tomorrow. so i show up on friday, same thing. and at 4:00 on friday afternoon, galen comes down and he just looks at me and he's like, so you must be jimmyand i said, yup. and he was like, okay. well, you have my undivided attention for the next two hours; what can i help you with? i was floored.  tim ferriss: two hours? that's legit, wow.  jimmy chin: well, that and i was like, oh, my god, it's galen! so then i get up there and i'm like kind of embarrassed. i was like, look, i want to go to this valley. so he pulled down two slide trays and started showing me pictures. i needed an objective because i was trying to write grant proposals, and i didn't even know where i was goingand he was like, here you go. and he literally pulled this slide out of the tray and was like, this is your objective.   and it was these two, huge towers that had been unclimbed. that's not something you give up, normally.  tim ferriss: you mean information-wise?  jimmy chin: yeah, not something if you're a longtime climber, you kind of keep those close to your chest. there are not that many of them out there, you know? so he gave those to me, gave that slide to me put me in contact, gave me the contact for his fixer on the ground there, nazir sabir, very influential; first pakistani to climb everest. then we walked around. during the second hour, we walked around and he had to sign these prints. i got to walk around these tables with his most iconic prints and he told me the stories about the prints. i was floored. i was almost speechless at this pointthen he sent me out the door and said, \"good luck, and you know what? you've got to promise me that you will take  a camera.\"    and i had just taken that photo that had sold, as well. so i bought a camera and put an expedition together to that valley, and that was the first expedition that i went on. and then fast forward, i think it was four years and i went on my first national geographic expedition with galen to tibet, and got to watch him work day in and day out for two months. it was hugely influential on multiple levels.  tim ferriss: what were some of the things you learned from him, whether those were principles, techniques, philosophies, sayings, anything?  jimmy chin: probably the most important thing was just how hard he workedhe was always up before sunrise to make sure that he was in position to get the best light.   he moved so much. we were crossing the changtang plateau unsupported, average elevation 17,000 feet.  tim ferriss: when you say unsupported, what do you mean by that?  jimmy chin: we were carrying everything on our backs.  tim ferriss: no sherpas?  jimmy chin: no, and no cars. no people to bring something to you if you needed it. we were in one of the most remote, high deserts in the world. those trips are all about efficiency; you never do anything unnecessary because you know you need every single ounce of energy to accomplish the goal. and yet here he was, running up - you have to understand, he was 62 when i went on this trip with him and i was 28   he was climbing these ridges up to the side and shooting back down to get this perspective, and then going back down to his stuff. he'd be way behind and then he'd have to catch up. then he would get ahead and shoot back and just to see what it took and how committed he was, and just how he lived through the lens\u00e9 sometimes mentors don't have to say anything. it's just you spend time with them, and that is the greatest gift you can have.   and sometimes it's just acknowledging that you're doing something right. it's not saying you have to do it this way or that way. sometimes you do. but what i've learned so much from my mentors that was so meaningful to me is i'd take an initiative, and they would kind of give you the nod.    like, you're doing the right thing. and that was a powerful lesson in terms of what it was to be a mentor. because that was so powerful for me to see that, and to say wow, i took a stab at something, i took a risk., and they're acknowledging that it was a good risk. it gives you so much m ore ownership over it too, sometimes.  tim ferriss: so conrad, in the film, does this a lot. he gives the nod to you quite a few times. i won't give away any punch lines of key moments that i think people should just see in the film. there is one moment, and i'd love to dig into fear as it relates to this. there is a moment, and i'm blanking on what it's called. oh, the house of cards, is that it?  jimmy chin: right.  tim ferriss: holy shit. can you describe this to me? describe for people what this house of cards is.   and then when you feel fear, if you do - i assume it's there - what is your internal dialogue? what do you say to yourself before you tackle something like that? if you could explain the house of cards to people and why it's called that? i had to really stop drinking my beverages in the theater because no. 1, it was cold by my very limp wristed standards in the theater, but my bladder, i was having sympathy fear just watching this. so what is the house of cards?  jimmy chin: the house of cards is one of the pitches which is essentially a role playing on a climb where i had to go up through this section of rock which was basically these delicately balanced, giant granite slabs that probably each weighed 10,000 pounds a piece.  i had to climb through them without ever over weighting any portion of my body, or else you'd peel one off and the whole thing would collapse like a house of cards. and as john so eloquently states in the film, it would floss the whole team off the mountainso it was fairly - we call it delicate climbing.tim ferriss: that's like the understatement of my podcasting career so far; delicate climbing.  jimmy chin: so it was my lead. with so much of the climbing on expeditions like this, sometimes you just have to take a really deep breath and believe in yourself that you will make the right decisions, and you're going to draw from all your experience.   it has to be tempered because it can't be overconfidence. and there's this fierce concentration. your world becomes so small in those moments, and in a way, also very expansive in the sense that you're so focused on the moment; so, so focused on the momentyour listeners are probably going to think i'm completely insane but that is part of the appeal of climbing; nothing takes me out of thinking of my emails or all these random trivialities in life that we usually think are so important; nothing takes me out of that more than climbing. there's this kind of fierce concentration. i was on that lead for i think it was actually eight hours.   when i finished it, and i got to the anchor and i was ready to come back down. it felt probably more like 45 minutes. you have to have that belief that you can do it, and you really draw deep into your experiences. i've been in those situations before, too, where in a way you train yourself to function in very high stakes, high consequence situations. so you draw from that place.  tim ferriss: i would imagine it's a process of sort of fear inoculation and exposing yourself to that in a progression of difficulty, right? you said people take their experience on el cap and then translate that into the bigger game, which is in pakistan or wherever they might be. talking about objectives, you said you needed an objective in your conversation with galen.   i sent a text to your wife, who is an old friend, and we were going back and forth about various things, catching up with life. then i was talking about the film, and i put, \"jimmy is a beast,\" capital letters, period, \"good lord, a real man in a world of - quote - guys - end quote; refreshing to see.\" now, i'm not hitting on you, although it probably seems like i'm hitting on you. but i do think there is a malaise among many males in, say, their 20s and 30s who are spending a lot of time sitting down in front of computer screens and they just don't feel sort of as manually literate or physically capable as their forefathers. i do think that causes a lot of problems.i so speaking of some objectives, what are some skills that you think every man should have, or things that every man should have done?  jimmy chin: first of all, i'd like to probably address the fact that i personally feel doubt and inadequacies all the time. after being on tour with this film, people were like: wow, you must not feel fear, you must not have any doubt. and i don't necessarily want to project that image because i think i'm fearful all the time. and among my peer group, i'm always like, oh, my god, i'm such a wimp. this guys' doing this, and this guy's doing that and i'm like, gosh, i don't know if i could do that. and i just want to put it out there that that's okay, and that's normal, an dim' okay with that.    but in terms of skills, if you're out there, and i can't speak to all the different things out there that i don't know\u00e9  tim ferriss: let's pretend, because no one's listening. it's just the two of uswe've had three glasses of wine each, and then i ask you this question.  jimmy chin: okay. that's a good way to put it. if you don't do this, then you're a total candy ass.  tim ferriss: right.  jimmy chin: there are some skills i wish i had that i think would be good. but mountain climbing is a great objective because there's so much around it. there's the organization, there's the vision, there's the comradery when you get your friend to go up there with youthere's learning, technical skills, there's opportunities to learn about yourself and push yourself.    it's physical, it's cerebral. it might be unfair coming from a mountain climber but i think mountain climbing can do a lot for you, and you get to be outside in these beautiful landscapes which is a huge part of the inspiration for me. i'd say writing well has been extremely important, not that i'm a great writer but i think it's an incredible skill that you need in whatever aspect of life you have.  tim ferriss: what has helped you improve your writing the most, whether lessons or teachers or books or practices or anything?jimmy chin: for me it was probably early on reading a lot and then finding favorite writers and examining why i liked their writing. it's so clich\u201d but i loved hemingway, you know?  tim ferriss: hemingway's great.    jimmy chin: in the same way, that's really how i developed my photography. i didn't have anybody teaching me but i looked at a ton of photography and i started to break down why i liked certain photographers. and then there are certain photographers that helped shape how i looked at my shooting. it's like studying other great people in the field has always been a great way for me to learn.  tim ferriss: who are some of your other favorite authors?  jimmy chin: oh, man.  tim ferriss: i'll throw out one just to buy you some time. i don't know if you've ever read coming into the country, by john mcphee, m-c-p-h-e-e about his travels in alaska? i think it won the pulitzer but just incredible writing as it relates to his outdoor expeditions.  jimmy chin: i've definitely read mcphee. i read jonathan franzen recently. john krakauer is a friend of mine but i've always been amazed at how he approaches his work. did i say john krakauer, or did i just say john?  tim ferriss: you said krakauer, yes.  jimmy chin: okay. let me think who else i have read recently. i just finished john krakauer's book, missoula, and i was just really impressed how he basically in a way changed how he wrote to address the subject in the most powerful way that he could, and being able to morph that way was really impressive to me.  tim ferriss: you guys obviously know one another. you've met a lot of successful people. but when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind, and why?  jimmy chin: you know who i've really been just endlessly impressed with is yvon chouinard.   tim ferriss: patagonia, yeah.jimmy chin: obviously, he's known for founding patagonia but he's like hacked the system, somehow. he's known for founding patagonia but he started 1 percent for the planet, and he started patagonia land trust. he found a way to have a successful commercial endeavor, understanding that there are necessary evils that people are still going to buy stuff; you still have to make clothing because people have to wear clothing. but yet, his approach is like we're going to make things that are the best things possible and we're going to do it as ecologically sustainable as we can. he's also led this incredible life of adventure and he's inspired me at so many different levels.   and i've been really fortunate to have spent some time with him.  tim ferriss: he's a sharp guy. he's a sharp dude. i remember his book, let mu people go surfing, i think is the name of it, had a really big impact when i first read it about ten years ago. i keep it in my closet so that i see it every morning when i get dressed. it's on the top shelf next to a few other books. what is the book that you've given most as a gift?  jimmy chin: it's probably two. one is musashi.  tim ferriss: oh, fantastic.  jimmy chin: loved that book. and the other one is this book called the guide to the i ching, by carol anthony, which was given to me as a freshman by one of my comparative religion teachers. i've pretty much traveled with that thing since; i've had a copy with me somewhere. it's just an interesting perspective.   tim ferriss: the i ching, it's like a rorschach test in a way, or a mirror, or both. i took an entire class in college on the i ching and the interpretation and use of the i ching in the historical context. very, very fascinating. i kind of put it aside for a very long time, and now it's very timely that you bring it up. i should go order this because i'm getting back into examining sort of how to draw value out of that. the author is carol anthony?  jimmy chin: yeah, it's funny because i don't consult - you call it consulting the i ching - very often these days. i almost carry it because if i see it\u00e9 i've looked at it so often, so many times over the years that i just look at it and i'm like, okay, i kind of know what the answer is for this dilemma i'm having. tim ferriss: that's awesome. that's super cool. i'd love to talk about your morning rituals. on your ideal morning, what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like? when do you wake up? what morning rituals are important to you, etc.?  jimmy chin: besides getting up and looking at my instagram? oh, my god, did i say that out loud? can you erase that? just kidding.  tim ferriss: what time do you wake up?  jimmy chin: i usually wake up around 7, 8, 8:30 if i've gone out late or stayed up late. i work late, and it's a terrible habit. i'm usually hammering emails until i fall asleep, which is awful. i've been trying to train myself to just read, which works every so often    but in an ideal morning, i would get up and one of the first things i would do would be to sit down and try to meditate and maintain that practice. i'm not great but it's always been beneficial when i've had some consistency in doing it.  tim ferriss: what type of meditation?  jimmy chin: 20 minutes.  tim ferriss: it sounds like transcendental meditation, or no?  jimmy chin: yeah, kind of a form of it. i've kind of looked at and played with different forms of meditation but that form is kind of the type that i've been doing lately. i don't even want to say that it is tm because it's more like a conglomeration of different things that i've learned and thought about.   then it's breakfast, which is usually toast and jam or granola and bananas and yogurt, something like that, or a smoothie. then i just open up my laptop. it's so boring. i start looking at emails and saying to myself, oh my gosh, i've got to hammer these outbecause what i'm trying to do is get as much done as i possibly can in the first few hours of the morning because my head is clear, so that i can go run outside and do something in the afternoon.  tim ferriss: is the morning, then, that is when you're mentally sharpest and you want to just knock stuff out before lunch so that you can get outside and run around and do whatever activity you want to partake in?  jimmy chin: yes.  tim ferriss: do you drink?  jimmy chin: no, not very much.   mainly because i'm asian and i get a headache and fall asleep.  tim ferriss: you guys are not great at processing ethanol, you guys.  jimmy chin: but i have been known to drink and yes, it's not uncommon for me to have a few drinks.  tim ferriss: if you walk into a bar, what do you order?  jimmy chin: i usually order a beer and nurse it for a long time. tequila is probably where i go if i'm going out to have a pretty good time.  tim ferriss: tequila. yeah, there's some good stuff out there. casamigos, the casa dragones. i was never a tequila fan because it turned me into a complete lunatic. and that only changed when i stopped mixing it with other things. unless we count club soda. club soda is a fair mixer but if i combine tequila with anything else, it's just a recipe for disaster in my experience.   jimmy chin: yes. good tequila, though.  tim ferriss: what $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in the last, say, six to 12 months?  jimmy chin: a classic thing i always buy, one of the niceties that i might get is this lip balm, black jack lip balm.  tim ferriss: black jack?  jimmy chin: yep. no, it's actually called jack black lip balm.  tim ferriss: jack black lip balm, got it.  jimmy chin: i've taken it on every expedition i've ever been on. it's 25 spf and it's like one of the few things that keeps your lips from cracking on a really tough expedition. so that's always nice to have.  tim ferriss: yeah, that's simple. jack black lip balm   i probably am not doing anything strenuous enough to warrant lip balm but that is probably an indication that i should get out and move my ass around in more strenuous environments. if you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say?  jimmy chin: that is a toughie.  tim ferriss: i'll give you another one you can choose from.  jimmy chin: it's funny because the two things that came into my mind immediately, one was chill. the other one was get after it. they are diametrically opposed.  tim ferriss: i can see the conflict. maybe you put them in different places.  jimmy chin: yes, maybe. i think that's kind of representative of the way i function. i tell people i'm the laziest motivated person that i know because i'm either just wanting to completely kick it back, or i'm going 150 miles an hour.  tim ferriss: right, trying to hit a first ascent.  jimmy chin: yeah.  tim ferriss: involving the house of cards and other things. what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self?  jimmy chin: i would probably say think of the long game. because i freaked myself out so much, being like, oh, my god i have to do this, i have to do that, i have to do this. i've always lived my life with a sense of urgency and sometimes that works out in your favor; sometimes you botch it and make bad, quick decisions. as i've gotten older, i've recognized that life just has its ups and downs. i mean the classic buddhist saying would be the middle path. you don't get super excited and overconfident when something really great happens for you.   and you don't get completely depressed if something bad happens for you. you just have to understand that life goes in these crazy waves and you just hold steady and put one foot in front of the other.  tim ferriss: i love it. and putting one foot in front of the other, that could be the subtitle of your latest film, also. could you please let everybody know where they can find the film, where they can find more information online and then where they can find you online? and of course, i will link to all of this in the show notes. where can they learn more about meru and more about you?  jimmy chin: i think the best place to look is merufilm.com, so m-e-r-u film dot com, and that has the list of all the theaters and other information about the film.   and then our handle on social media for instagram, twitter and facebook are all also merufilm, or @merufilm. we're releasing online in november on itunes so look for us there. and then for myself, it's just jimmychin.com. as we all know, documentaries kind of live and die by word of mouth and hopefully people have an opportunity to see it. and if they like it, please share the stokethat would be great.  tim ferriss: yeah, you guys have to check it outmeru is spectacular. we will chat maybe another time about how the hell you guys actually captured footage in a lot of these situations. i think that's an entire conversation in and of itself. but folks, check it out. it's very well worth the time. you know i love docs, and this is the best one i've seen in a very, very long time   check it out, if you want to be inspired, terrified, pee your pants just a little bit; it's good every once in awhile. it's healthy for your bladder and urethra. you should check it out. jimmy, i really appreciate the time, man. you've inspired me to get my pale, lazy ass outside in much greater volume in the coming year. so for that, i thank you.  jimmy chin: thank you for having me.  tim ferriss: yeah man, keep up the great work and i will talk to you

ascent and what is a first descent in climbing and skiing, respectively", "because you've done both", "is that right", "yes", "to give it some context, those are the descriptions of what professional climbers and skiers or snowboarders do", "because really, when you're a professional climber or a professional skier, you often are trying to do firsts; things that have never been done before", "you make a career of trying to do first ascents or first descents", "that's really kind of like your legacy, toofor instance, if i show up at a mountain range, the karakoram in pakistan, and i go to the trango towers, which is this beautiful range of big, alpine walls in pakistan, i can look at the mountains and i'll see these prominent lines", "you'll either have a guidebook or you'll be with

inspiration, too, in a lot of ways", "and then if you're a skier, you can go up to alaska and you'll see this big, intimidating lines and they're related to somebody   doug coombs, one of the great skiers of our generation, he did the first descent", "and they're important because they represent a person's legacy in a way, but they also inspired somebody", "they had to have a vision to do it",

retrospectively - i suppose it's redundant but you get the idea - at your three silos, and they're not really silos because they're so intertwined, the photography, the athletics, the climbing and alpine sport and then the filmmaking, if you could only be remembered for one of those three, which would you choose and why", "oh, boy", "that's a tough one", "i don't even know if i can answer that because they're so important to me", "there are crossovers within the communities, and i'm not trying totally dodge the question", "but my peer group, i think of my peer group when you ask me that question", "there are so many people who i respect and appreciate in each category, i guess you could say", "they're all equally important and inspiring to me", "so i guess that is the answer, that there isn't one that i would prefer to be remembered by, or i'd love to be remembered by all of them", "let me rephrase that", "if you had to stop doing one of them, gun against the head, had to choose one, which would it be", "oh, you're making this tough", "yeah, and there's a lot more where that came from", "yeah, i'm sure there is", "you know, i would probably choose - oh, man   climbing and skiing have provided so much inspiration for the other two and the passion for the other two in a lot of ways were rooted in being in the wild, the experiences that i had and have in the mountains, and in the ocean surfing", "i'm a pretty physical person and i just find such great joy in doing those things", "okay", "i guess i'll say the climbing and the skiing and the surfing; the athletics", "that's what i'd pick", "that's what you'd pick to keep?that's what i'd pick to keep", "let's talk about the physical side of things because i know the people listening are very interested in your training regimens and things like that", "we're going to rewind the clock at one point and talk about your upbringing and background a bit", "a mutual friend of ours sent me this paragraph, and i'd love to dig into it a little bit", "\"his training regimen is alien", "example, to our car to car ski lapse on the grant teton, question mark, exclamation point, question mark.\" so i want to come back to that because i'm not sure what that is", "\"he'd be in town having a coffee after a grand lap by mid morningexum guides\" - i don't know what that is - \"in jackson hole list this as a two day ascent, and many would consider it the seminole achievement of their mountaineering life", "it's a standard workout for him.\"   i want to drill into this, exactly", "what is a tour hour car to car ski lap", "i think the hours are probably wrong", "i've never done it in two hours, car to car, and i don't think anybody has", "but i have done certainly a sub-ten, maybe even around six hours; i can't remember", "i'm not one of those people that records my time every single time i go up and do something", "i have a general sense, and it's more just for me to gauge where my fitness is at", "a car to car time, let's say it's six to eight hours, somewhere in there, is basically you start in the valley floor and if you did start a stopwatch, you'd start it when you left the car", "then you'd climb up the grand, and you'd ski back down to the car and then you'd stop the clock", "so car to car, i think one of the times that has been kind of recognized was when i was training to ski everest, i was kind of doing laps on the grand", "i would do it a few times a weekat one point towards the end when i was really fit, i climbed and skied the grand, and then went over and skied the middle, and then went over and climbed and skied the south teton back to the car in i think it was sub-ten hours   i can't remember exactly but something like that", "for me to think about it now, even, i'm like wow, that's pretty fast because i don't think i could do that right now", "and could i do it again at some point", "maybe", "but yeah, that's how i trained", "i do have to train in the gym now probably more than i ever had to before", "and i don't particularly love it because the whole point for me was being in the mountains, and i didn't necessarily consider it just training because i got to be in the mountains, and i got to climb and ski and breathe and push myself, and look at the starry sky early in the morning or watch the sun rise", "there's so much beauty in that", "when i'm in a gym, it feels a little lacking", "but i have to do it now more", "is that a function of age, or what is the reason you have to spend more time in the gym", "some people who i've seen in their kind of arc, in their career arc as a professional alpinist or ski mountaineer, they've moved more into the gym because there's less exposure to risks", "it is kind of a statistics game; the more time you're out there, the more risk you're exposed to and it catches up to you", "so there is that partfor me, that's not necessarily the case", "it's more the fact that i'm traveling a ton", "i'm married to my wonderful wife who lives in manhattan and you just don't get those full days", "and to get in the mountains, you have to wait for the right conditions, too", "if it's stormy, you can't just go", "you kind of have to wait", "and i don't have that luxury", "it's like okay, i have to train", "i have to have a certain amount of consistency to stay in shape", "what does your week of exercise look like currently", "and let's separate that from launch time with the new film, and so on, and just think about a non crunch period like that", "although i think you probably have a lot of crunch times, from the looks of it", "but assuming that you're in wyoming, what does a week of training look like for you", "and the more specific the better because i love it and i know the people listening would really enjoy it", "it's hard for me not to think - and maybe this will be helpful to you", "i can think about what it used to look like in my mid to late 20s when i could just go, and then also right now", "but right now, a week at home, i'll usually set aside two full days, if i'm home for seven days", "so two of the seven days, i'll set aside for full days", "and one full day, depending on the season, would be to go on - if it's the winter - a huge ski tour or climbing and skiing one of the peaks in the tetons as one of my big days", "in the winter, it would be two of those", "it would be ski something big in the grand, teton national park and then another big, full day skiing back country at the resort or ski touring up on teton pass, which is this great back country ski accessed area", "and then the five days in between, i'd probably be working most of the day", "i would just get like one or two laps on the pass, which is an approximately 1,500 foot hike and then ski down", "and i would probably do that once or twice, if i had a little bit more time in the afternoon", "i'd probably throw in some yoga once or twice a week, or just some stretching once or twice a week, as well", "what type of gym work would you be doing in that week", "or would you not be doing much gym work", "i probably wouldn't be doing much gym work", "it seems like in the summertime, there's probably a chance i would do two days in the gym, which would probably be core stuff", "it would probably be core and yoga of some sort", "when you say core, to get really specific, how long are those workouts and what might a hypothetical or real sequence of exercises look like for you", "probably, if i'm lucky and i have somebody that i'm training with who will run me through a workout, there's sand bag getups\u00e9  like a turkish getup using a sandbag or different", "exactly", "it's like turkish sandbags", "are you doing that with one arm", "it's just one of those sandbags with the handles on them", "yeah, and you throw it over your shoulder", "ah, so it's a getup with a sandbag on your shoulder", "that sounds miserable", "exactly", "it's not that much fun", "what type of rep set scheme are you doing with that", "it depends", "i think i'd probably be doing a 60 pound sandbag, and i think it's like 5 to 10 on each side", "and then i would go to do a series of sit-ups or some sort of leg lifts or something like that, or you're hanging off of something and doing leg lifts and then planks, essentially", "kind of three core workouts back to back and you do a whole round of them.got it", "so you do a sandbag getup, some type of leg lift, plank, and then repeat that sequence", "yeah", "and in the winter, if there's a climbing station where there's a wall there to hang off of, i'll do a core workout and then i'll just get on an overhanging wall for four or five minutes and just work out my arms, just so i keep some semblance of my climbing capacity", "and really that's one of the hardest things for me", "i'm supposed to be a climber, and most of the serious professional climbers, they just climb year round", "and most of the skiers ski year round", "so they go to south america and ski during our summers", "but i'm kind of switching back and forth and they don't complement each other that well", "because skiers get these huge legs, and that's like the worst if you're a rock climber", "big, meaty thighs", "exactly", "obviously, really strong forearms and finger strength does nothing for your skiing", "that's like a constant kind of battle", "it's like being a bench press competitor and a competitive cyclist", "something like that", "not to say you're doing much bench pressing but the point being that yeah, the exercises do not necessarily transfer from one to the other", "this is talked about in meru, which i enjoyed incredibly; i recommended it to 500,000 people or so via this newsletter that i send out every friday called five bullet friday", "i found it extremely inspiring but i want to talk specifically about - it's not really a biathlon; it's kind of like a triathlon but in an unconventional sense", "so meru, i guess it's the shark's fin, am i getting this right", "yes, the shark's fin", "the shark's fin has defeated some of the top climbers and alpinists for 20, 30 years because you can't just be good at big wall climbing", "and please correct me if i'm wrong; i'm trying to give people who aren't familiar with this stuff some context", "it's a big wall, you could think of, say, el capitan or some of these sheer surfaces in yosemite as a big wall", "you can't just be a good big wall climber; you can't just be a good ice climber", "you can't just be good at any one of the disciplines; you have to be world class at all of them", "and what i'd love to ask you is for instance, in the case of rock climbing, and when people think of an indoor gym or just climbing outside, bouldering or doing top climbing or lead climbing if they're more advanced, what are some common novice wastes of time or mistakes", "and i'm just going to kind of hit each of these disciplines for people who are eager to practice this stuff", "if we look at rock climbing first, in your own development and looking back and knowing all the people you know, what should novices do more of and less of", "i'd say in terms of technique, the classic mistake that climbers make when they first start is that they think it's all about having these big arms and upper body strengthand it's really actually about the footwork and balance, and keeping your weight over your feet", "it's the classic scenario where you have the big, burly guy who's about to start climbing, and then the petite woman that is a little bit intimidated; there's a different attitude towards it", "and then the guy gets up there and is trying to muscle through this climb and use his big, burly shoulders that he's been building in the gym", "and he can't get 20 feet off the ground", "and then this small, petite woman who maybe did ballet or gymnastics gets up there and floats put the thing", "and then the guy is totally destroyed, right, on multiple levels", "you see that all the time", "because the woman is a) being smart, and she isn't leaning towards muscle; it's more about how she stands on her feet and is just being much more thoughtful about how to climb this thing", "i don't know if that necessarily answers your question", "no, it's helpful", "i've watched women in the gym and consistently the higher level climbers are better at keeping their arms straight and keeping their bodies over their feet, or at least using their feet to their advantage", "if you were training someone in rock climbing, how would you have them practice for the first, say, two weeks", "would it be on the bouldering wall", "would they be doing top roping", "would they be incorporating other things like slack lining", "if you really wanted to lay a very, very good foundation, what would you focus on in those first two weeks?i would probably get them on the bouldering wall just to get familiar with moving around and not being so caught up in the rope work and all of those things", "and just getting that body movement, that muscle memory for just moving around on a vertical surface", "the top roping, i would bring that in", "getting them confident with tying the knots so that they understand the systems", "because so much of the fear that comes in climbing is often perceived and a lot of what you do as a climber is you're managing fear", "and i often talk about managing fear by recognizing the difference between perceived risks and real risks   so when you teach somebody about these systems and they understand it, and they're like, oh this is a safety system, and this is how it works; you can help alleviate some of the fear of the climbing and the height", "so i would just take them top roping and get them familiar with climbing a bit higher and using that technique that they've been learning on the bouldering wall, as well", "let's talk about gear for a second, because i know people have asked me to ask you when you're in the gym or not doing cold weather stuff, when you're just working on climbing, what type of shoes do you wear", "for normal rock climbing", "yes", "i guess it would just be climbing shoes", "you mean what brand", "yes", "i normally climb in 510", "they're known for having the best sticky rubber", "any particular model", "i've climbed a lot in the anasazis for more everyday climbing", "and for back country skiing and ski touring, what type of gear do you use", "i use dynafit boots and the dynafit bindings", "and then skis, over the last few years usually i'm on armada skis or black diamond skis", "when you're doing downhill, i would imagine the gear changes quite a bit but i don't know; it's outside my area of expertise", "it's funny because i use a lot of different brands based on what boot they have", "i've skied lange boots and armada skis for many years", "that's kind of like my on resort setup", "that's the main", "that's the go-to", "yeah", "when you're doing this training and doing laps of various types, and you're out there for five to ten hours, what does your nutrition look like, if anything", "what are you bringing with you in terms of water and food", "on bigger days in the mountains, this is non expedition but let's say i'm going up to climb and ski the grand or i'm doing a long run across the tetons or something in the summer", "it's usually i have clif shots, clif blocks", "i also use a lot of hammer nutrition stuff which i think triathletes and endurance athletes use", "there's heed, which is a great carbohydrate drink hat isn't over flavored and pretty easy to use", "i like to have real food, as well so it's usually like a ham sandwich or pb&j or a couple of them", "i also take endurolytes, which is basically an electrolyte pill that hammer nutrition makes", "i bring a lot of life saver mints", "life saver mints, why life savers", "i don't know", "they're like a little nicety to have when you're on a long run or a big day out", "i have a terrible sweet tooth so it kind of helps with that, as well", "do you bring life savers on your bigger expeditions, as well", "like on meru, did you have a stash of life savers", "absolutely", "i noticed, of course, and a lot of people have noticed, that you have ear buds in a lot when you're climbing or, i would imagine, exercising", "when you're on these bigger expeditions, what are you listening to", "and actually, justin boreta of the glitch mob wanted to ask this specifically  no way", "yeah, he's been on the podcast before", "so he wanted to know what do you listen to, how do you use music when climbing, etc.", "so i'd love to just hear what is in your ears", "that is hilarious", "well, a couple things", "i don't usually climb, like when i'm actually leading or if i'm belaying, i'm not listening to an ear pod", "but on expeditions, i definitely on the treks in where it's four or five days of trekking, i'll be listening to music", "and yes, certainly sometimes when i'm bouldering or pouring up in the mountains to ski something i'll have them in", "but when it gets real, like there's real climbing or real skiing happening, i definitely am not listening to music at that point", "when you're trekking in, what are some favorites", "it's funny [inaudible] who's amazing and i love the glitch mobwe definitely listened to the glitch mob on meru", "and despite the weight limitations that we put on ourselves, we brought this teeny, little nano and a little micro speaker with a solar speaker", "we had glitch mob on there", "that's awesome", "i've been a huge fan of them for a long time", "we had everything from classic reggae, jose gonzalez, eddie vetter, and the classics, too, like led zeppelin and neil young", "it's really across the boardi'll listen to bach", "on these long trips, i usually have a pretty good mix of music", "glitch mob and jose gonzalez were definitely playing a lot on our meru expedition", "when you look back at all of your experiences, and i'm sure you get approached by many - wanna be sounds bad - but aspiring mountaineers, and i apologize that i'm not sure if mountaineer is interchangeable with alpine climber or alpinist; i don't know the vocabibut for people who look at your life outdoors and envy that, and want to spend more time outside and want a goal of some type, let's just assume that they are mid-30s, used to be pretty athletic, maybe competed as an athlete, spend a lot of time sitting down but not to reverse that and need a goal of some type, what would be some decent goals to put on the calendar in terms of certain ascents or summits or anything like that", "let's assume they don't have any real technical training to speak of at this point", "i think there are a couple avenues to come into it", "i think nols is a good way to come into it, the national outdoor leadership school based out of lander, wyoming", "i think they have a few adult classes", "another great way to come into it, of course, too if you're a professional and you want more one-on-one kind of instruction, i think the best way to do that is to come into it by hiring a guide", "i think a great mini expedition for someone or a goal would be to climb the grand teton   because you come into it, you learn basics of rope work", "you learn how to belay and you go climbing for a couple days down low so your comfortable with the rock climbing and the systems", "and then you get to go up on the grand where it's a bit more alpine and higher altitude, and then you get to climb a mountain", "a lot of people, like a typical good client who's getting a lot out of the experience will have that climb under their belt and then the next year, they'll call a guide if they got along with them really well and had a good time and say hey, let's do something else", "and that guide will probably come up with another really cool idea and maybe that's climbing a harder route on the grand or going into the wind river range", "there are ways to kind of continue to progress as a climber", "but then you also have the safety of this very knowledgeable guide", "how would one go about finding a good guide", "are there certain websites or resources that you would recommend", "in jackson for climbing the grand, there are two outfits", "one is exum mountain guides and the other one is jackson hole mountain guides   all of their guides have gone through courses and have definitely been in the mountains a lot", "they'll assign one", "most of the guys i know are great", "so that's one way to go into it", "you can also do this kind of thing in yosemite or in the sierras, as well", "that's another place to go", "i saw a great documentary called valley uprising, about the last whatever it is, 50 years in yosemite big wall climbing", "it kind of traces everything from the very early days all the way up to alex honnald, right", "is that how you say his last name", "yeah", "and a number of mutants like that", "the question that i wanted to tackle next is going way, way back", "where were you born and raised", "i was born and raised in minnesota, mankato, minnesota", "it's basically this small farm town with a small university in it", "had your parents been there for multiple generations", "no, my parents were both from china", "my mother was from harbin, on the north", "i was just going to say they had to be from some cold ass place like harbin to go to minnesota", "my mom was", "she came from this really progressive family", "my grandfather was trained in western medicine and a doctor, and my grandmother spoke multiple languages", "she was pretty progressive for her time", "she was apparently an actress in japanese cinema; i don't know how that worked out", "wow, that's out there", "yeah", "so she came from that kind of a world", "and then my father was from the south, in winso", "he was from a really traditional, conservative, military family", "it's very unlikely that those two would have met in china", "but in that era, both of their families left china during the communist revolution and ended up in taiwan", "and then they both went to the united states and met in the states", "they moved to chicago after they got married", "didn't like the city and heard that minnesota was apparently a good place to raise a family, so they moved to minnesota and worked at the university in mankato", "and that's where i was born", "both of them worked at the university", "yes", "what did they do there", "they were both librarians", "that's fascinating", "what were some defining moments in your childhood", "when you think back to how you were raised and growing up in that environment, if you had to pick a defining moment in your childhood, what would one be", "they were very kind of stereotypical chinese parents", "they were very focused on academics and kind of these extracurricular activities", "so i started playing the violin when i was 3 and a halfand i swam competitively from when i was 7 through high schoolthen i studied martial arts from as long as i can remember from my dad", "so my mom was kind of like pushing the violin side; my dad was pushing the martial arts side and they both kind of agreed on the swimming part", "but my life was consumed by these things because i was basically either practicing the violin, going to swim practice, or going to the dojo and competing every weekend", "i played in the youth orchestra, and i was studying a lot", "so i was pushed pretty hard", "i was also really motivated", "i wanted to do well in these things", "but they were a bit confining, in a way", "so when i found skiing, there was a little ski hill behind my house and that was my reward if i did well in everything else", "i still remember i skied in jeans and a jean jacket, froze my ass off, on this little bump", "it was like the andre agassi of asian kids in minnesota", "which i was like the only one, by the way, in mankato", "there were not that many asian kids", "you have your own small child now, am i right", "yes", "what are you going to do differently, if anything, in raising your child compared to your parents", "and that's not meant as a criticism of your parents", "i'm just curious what you'll definitely borrow and what you think you'll do differently", "i've been thinking about that a lot", "i've really had to go against the grain", "my parents were not into the fact that i finished college and decided i was going to go\u00e9  i discovered climbing, as well, late in high school and i was obsessed", "i told them hey, i'm going to take a year off after college instead of looking for this new career i was supposed to go on", "they really were: your three options are lawyer, doctor, executive", "so when i told them i was going to live out of my car for a year, and the way i framed it was i've just got to get it out of my system and then i will pursue a power career somewhere", "happily", "one year turned into two, two turned into three", "i lived out of the back of a little blue subaru for seven years until i was 28, climbing and skiing and doing odd jobs like shoveling roofs on mansions in jackson", "we'd have to do rope work", "i did random stuff to make it work", "they were mortified", "my mom would say, \"well, of course we're worried; there's no word in chinese for what you do", "what are you doing?\" i couldn't imagine a different life because it was so powerful for me to do that", "and it was tough", "i had a lot of doubt about it", "and it didn't help, obviously, that every time i called them, they were like, what are you doing", "so what i took away from that, though, was that the foundation that they set for me in that sort of discipline, and even though it wasn't like i found the martial arts, i did eventually really love it", "swimming, it was just i did love that physical aspect of competition and pushing as hard as you can and improving incrementally, and understanding what it takes to progress", "playing the violin was incredible, and i'm so thankful that i picked up the guitar in college and it was really easy to pick up, and music has been a big part of my life   those aspects of my upbringing, while at points in my use i hated them but there's so much appreciation for it", "they also raised me to speak bilingually", "they would ignore me if i didn't speak to them in chinese", "they knew i was going to learn english but at home it was only chinese", "i got to grow up with another languagewhen i was younger, i was like, my parents are crazy; nobody else makes their kids do this stuff", "but i really appreciated it   so i don't think i'll necessarily dictate you have to do this and this and this", "i'm certainly going to share the things that i love with my daughter marina and if she enjoys them or becomes passionate\u00e9 and that could be photography, too", "i'm going to share those things with her", "i think i'll have the capacity to recognize whether or not she finds one of them really appealing", "in a lot of ways it's also selfish because i want to be able to ski with my daughter, and surf with my daughter", "but i want her to find something she's passionate about", "i've told myself this, and i don't know whether or not i'll be able to execute on it but to wrap my head around that it could be something totally different than what you expect and you're going to have to embrace it and give her all those opportunities that she needs to pursue whatever that thing is", "and maybe it's knitting, who knows", "my mom and dad did that with me quite a lot", "they didn't have the same focus on music, although i took music lessons", "i was a chronic quitter with music but they did expose me to a lot", "we didn't have a lot of money but i was constantly exposed to things outside, to different types of activities and they put whatever muscle they could behind helping my brother and me to explore those things", "i'm really grateful for that", "and i had a number of mentors, but this isn't about me", "i want to ask you about your mentors, and i only know about a few of them", "conrad anchor is in the film", "if you're listening to this, you have to go see meru", "it's time extremely well spent and it's a beautiful film, and a terrifying film and, at points, a hilarious film", "but i wanted to talk about and ask you about someone i'm less familiar with", "we've mentioned photography but haven't really touched on your start, and i'm not familiar with it", "so i was hoping you could maybe tell the story of meeting galen rowell", "yeah, it's galen rowell", "rowell, there we go", "could you explain how you became exposed to photography and then how you met galen", "i never studied photography; i didn't take any classes in photography", "i actually had a friend who wanted to be a photographer show me how to use his camera while we were on a climb in yosemite", "i took a photo with it and he was trying to sell his photos, which were slides at the time", "he sold one photo and it happened to be mine, for $500.00", "he still says, i started jimmy's career, which is true", "he went on to do great things in his field, as well", "it was so funny because in a way i'm embarrassed to say that i didn't come at photography from this inspiration of creativity and art", "i came at it from oh, i live out of my car; $500 i can live for basically two months", "i'm like, man, i only have to take one photo a month and i could do this for the rest of my life", "that was my 20-year-old self thinking", "obviously, i've evolved from there   so i picked up photography then and was very fortunate to start shooting right away for commercial clients, just because my peer group were all these climbers like dean potter and seth davis and timmy o'neil and cedar [inaudible] and they all became famous climbers", "i started shooting for patagonia and the north face right away because they wanted someone they didn't have to worry about when they were up climbing", "i could climb and i would shoot with themgalen came into my life when i started looking at a lot of different photography", "he embodied this form of adventure photography that was very participatory", "he was shooting from the inside out, as opposed to from the outside in", "what do you mean by that", "where he's part of the team and climbing, and he was a very talented and visionary climber", "he has first ascents all over the world", "got it", "he was a peer with his subject matter", "exactly", "i related to that", "at one point, i saw these photos of conrad and this other climber, peter kraft in pakistan in this unbelievable valley   and i was like, okay, that is the end gameif i'm going to commit to being a climber, and i'm going to be in yosemite, climbing el cap wasn't the end game", "that was where you cut your teeth", "you took what you learned in yosemite and you go to a place like this place in this picture; the high altitude, big walls of pakistan", "so i'm like 24, maybe, 23 and i decide okay, the one guy who's going to know how to get there is this guy galen", "so i drove from wyoming to berkeley where is gallery was, and i showed up at his office", "berkeley, california", "yeah", "i walk in the office, and the receptionist is there and she's like, can i help you", "i'm like, yeah, i'm here to see galen", "and she's like, and you are\u00e9", "i'm like, well, i'm jimmy chin", "she's like, okay", "she goes upstairs", "she comes back", "she's like, he just came back from this huge shoot and there's all these photo editors there; he doesn't have time to see you today", "so i was like, well, that's cool; do you mind if i hang out and look around a bit", "she's like, that's fine", "so i sit in the lobby that day, the rest of the afternoon, kind of like moping around and looking at pictures", "the place closes and i leave", "i come back the next day and same thing", "they're like, oh it's you again", "i'm like, yeah, is he around", "and they're like, not really   so basically i do the same thing on tuesday, do the same thing on wednesday, do the same thing on thursday and by then, they're kind of like: dude, what's your deal", "and one of the guys there, a little bit younger, was like, man, what are you doing", "and i'm like, i just want to meet him", "i just need ten minutes of his time", "they were like, maybe come back tomorrow", "so i show up on friday, same thing", "and at 4:00 on friday afternoon, galen comes down and he just looks at me and he's like, so you must be jimmyand i said, yup", "and he was like, okay", "well, you have my undivided attention for the next two hours; what can i help you with", "i was floored", "two hours", "that's legit, wow", "well, that and i was like, oh, my god, it's galen", "so then i get up there and i'm like kind of embarrassed", "i was like, look, i want to go to this valley", "so he pulled down two slide trays and started showing me pictures", "i needed an objective because i was trying to write grant proposals, and i didn't even know where i was goingand he was like, here you go", "and he literally pulled this slide out of the tray and was like, this is your objective", "and it was these two, huge towers that had been unclimbed", "that's not something you give up, normally", "you mean information-wise", "yeah, not something if you're a longtime climber, you kind of keep those close to your chest", "there are not that many of them out there, you know", "so he gave those to me, gave that slide to me put me in contact, gave me the contact for his fixer on the ground there, nazir sabir, very influential; first pakistani to climb everest", "then we walked around", "during the second hour, we walked around and he had to sign these prints", "i got to walk around these tables with his most iconic prints and he told me the stories about the prints", "i was floored", "i was almost speechless at this pointthen he sent me out the door and said, \"good luck, and you know what", "you've got to promise me that you will take  a camera.\"    and i had just taken that photo that had sold, as well", "so i bought a camera and put an expedition together to that valley, and that was the first expedition that i went on", "and then fast forward, i think it was four years and i went on my first national geographic expedition with galen to tibet, and got to watch him work day in and day out for two months", "it was hugely influential on multiple levels", "what were some of the things you learned from him, whether those were principles, techniques, philosophies, sayings, anything", "probably the most important thing was just how hard he workedhe was always up before sunrise to make sure that he was in position to get the best light", "he moved so much", "we were crossing the changtang plateau unsupported, average elevation 17,000 feet", "when you say unsupported, what do you mean by that", "we were carrying everything on our backs", "no sherpas", "no, and no cars", "no people to bring something to you if you needed it", "we were in one of the most remote, high deserts in the world", "those trips are all about efficiency; you never do anything unnecessary because you know you need every single ounce of energy to accomplish the goal", "and yet here he was, running up - you have to understand, he was 62 when i went on this trip with him and i was 28   he was climbing these ridges up to the side and shooting back down to get this perspective, and then going back down to his stuff", "he'd be way behind and then he'd have to catch up", "then he would get ahead and shoot back and just to see what it took and how committed he was, and just how he lived through the lens\u00e9 sometimes mentors don't have to say anything", "it's just you spend time with them, and that is the greatest gift you can have", "and sometimes it's just acknowledging that you're doing something right", "it's not saying you have to do it this way or that way", "sometimes you do", "but what i've learned so much from my mentors that was so meaningful to me is i'd take an initiative, and they would kind of give you the nod", "like, you're doing the right thing", "and that was a powerful lesson in terms of what it was to be a mentor", "because that was so powerful for me to see that, and to say wow, i took a stab at something, i took a risk., and they're acknowledging that it was a good risk", "it gives you so much m ore ownership over it too, sometimes", "so conrad, in the film, does this a lot", "he gives the nod to you quite a few times", "i won't give away any punch lines of key moments that i think people should just see in the film", "there is one moment, and i'd love to dig into fear as it relates to this", "there is a moment, and i'm blanking on what it's called", "oh, the house of cards, is that it", "right", "holy shit", "can you describe this to me", "describe for people what this house of cards is", "and then when you feel fear, if you do - i assume it's there - what is your internal dialogue", "what do you say to yourself before you tackle something like that", "if you could explain the house of cards to people and why it's called that", "i had to really stop drinking my beverages in the theater because no", "1, it was cold by my very limp wristed standards in the theater, but my bladder, i was having sympathy fear just watching this", "so what is the house of cards", "the house of cards is one of the pitches which is essentially a role playing on a climb where i had to go up through this section of rock which was basically these delicately balanced, giant granite slabs that probably each weighed 10,000 pounds a piece", "i had to climb through them without ever over weighting any portion of my body, or else you'd peel one off and the whole thing would collapse like a house of cards", "and as john so eloquently states in the film, it would floss the whole team off the mountainso it was fairly - we call it delicate climbing.that's like the understatement of my podcasting career so far; delicate climbing", "so it was my lead", "with so much of the climbing on expeditions like this, sometimes you just have to take a really deep breath and believe in yourself that you will make the right decisions, and you're going to draw from all your experience", "it has to be tempered because it can't be overconfidence", "and there's this fierce concentration", "your world becomes so small in those moments, and in a way, also very expansive in the sense that you're so focused on the moment; so, so focused on the momentyour listeners are probably going to think i'm completely insane but that is part of the appeal of climbing; nothing takes me out of thinking of my emails or all these random trivialities in life that we usually think are so important; nothing takes me out of that more than climbing", "there's this kind of fierce concentration", "i was on that lead for i think it was actually eight hours", "when i finished it, and i got to the anchor and i was ready to come back down", "it felt probably more like 45 minutes", "you have to have that belief that you can do it, and you really draw deep into your experiences", "i've been in those situations before, too, where in a way you train yourself to function in very high stakes, high consequence situations", "so you draw from that place", "i would imagine it's a process of sort of fear inoculation and exposing yourself to that in a progression of difficulty, right", "you said people take their experience on el cap and then translate that into the bigger game, which is in pakistan or wherever they might be", "talking about objectives, you said you needed an objective in your conversation with galen", "i sent a text to your wife, who is an old friend, and we were going back and forth about various things, catching up with life", "then i was talking about the film, and i put, \"jimmy is a beast,\" capital letters, period, \"good lord, a real man in a world of - quote - guys - end quote; refreshing to see.\" now, i'm not hitting on you, although it probably seems like i'm hitting on you", "but i do think there is a malaise among many males in, say, their 20s and 30s who are spending a lot of time sitting down in front of computer screens and they just don't feel sort of as manually literate or physically capable as their forefathers", "i do think that causes a lot of problems.i so speaking of some objectives, what are some skills that you think every man should have, or things that every man should have done", "first of all, i'd like to probably address the fact that i personally feel doubt and inadequacies all the time", "after being on tour with this film, people were like: wow, you must not feel fear, you must not have any doubt", "and i don't necessarily want to project that image because i think i'm fearful all the time", "and among my peer group, i'm always like, oh, my god, i'm such a wimp", "this guys' doing this, and this guy's doing that and i'm like, gosh, i don't know if i could do that", "and i just want to put it out there that that's okay, and that's normal, an dim' okay with that", "but in terms of skills, if you're out there, and i can't speak to all the different things out there that i don't know\u00e9  let's pretend, because no one's listening", "it's just the two of uswe've had three glasses of wine each, and then i ask you this question", "okay", "that's a good way to put it", "if you don't do this, then you're a total candy ass", "right", "there are some skills i wish i had that i think would be good", "but mountain climbing is a great objective because there's so much around it", "there's the organization, there's the vision, there's the comradery when you get your friend to go up there with youthere's learning, technical skills, there's opportunities to learn about yourself and push yourself", "it's physical, it's cerebral", "it might be unfair coming from a mountain climber but i think mountain climbing can do a lot for you, and you get to be outside in these beautiful landscapes which is a huge part of the inspiration for me", "i'd say writing well has been extremely important, not that i'm a great writer but i think it's an incredible skill that you need in whatever aspect of life you have", "what has helped you improve your writing the most, whether lessons or teachers or books or practices or anything?for me it was probably early on reading a lot and then finding favorite writers and examining why i liked their writing", "it's so clich\u201d but i loved hemingway, you know", "hemingway's great", "in the same way, that's really how i developed my photography", "i didn't have anybody teaching me but i looked at a ton of photography and i started to break down why i liked certain photographers", "and then there are certain photographers that helped shape how i looked at my shooting", "it's like studying other great people in the field has always been a great way for me to learn", "who are some of your other favorite authors", "oh, man", "i'll throw out one just to buy you some time", "i don't know if you've ever read coming into the country, by john mcphee, m-c-p-h-e-e about his travels in alaska", "i think it won the pulitzer but just incredible writing as it relates to his outdoor expeditions", "i've definitely read mcphee", "i read jonathan franzen recently", "john krakauer is a friend of mine but i've always been amazed at how he approaches his work", "did i say john krakauer, or did i just say john", "you said krakauer, yes", "okay", "let me think who else i have read recently", "i just finished john krakauer's book, missoula, and i was just really impressed how he basically in a way changed how he wrote to address the subject in the most powerful way that he could, and being able to morph that way was really impressive to me", "you guys obviously know one another", "you've met a lot of successful people", "but when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind, and why", "you know who i've really been just endlessly impressed with is yvon chouinard", "patagonia, yeah.obviously, he's known for founding patagonia but he's like hacked the system, somehow", "he's known for founding patagonia but he started 1 percent for the planet, and he started patagonia land trust", "he found a way to have a successful commercial endeavor, understanding that there are necessary evils that people are still going to buy stuff; you still have to make clothing because people have to wear clothing", "but yet, his approach is like we're going to make things that are the best things possible and we're going to do it as ecologically sustainable as we can", "he's also led this incredible life of adventure and he's inspired me at so many different levels", "and i've been really fortunate to have spent some time with him", "he's a sharp guy", "he's a sharp dude", "i remember his book, let mu people go surfing, i think is the name of it, had a really big impact when i first read it about ten years ago", "i keep it in my closet so that i see it every morning when i get dressed", "it's on the top shelf next to a few other books", "what is the book that you've given most as a gift", "it's probably two", "one is musashi", "oh, fantastic", "loved that book", "and the other one is this book called the guide to the i ching, by carol anthony, which was given to me as a freshman by one of my comparative religion teachers", "i've pretty much traveled with that thing since; i've had a copy with me somewhere", "it's just an interesting perspective", "the i ching, it's like a rorschach test in a way, or a mirror, or both", "i took an entire class in college on the i ching and the interpretation and use of the i ching in the historical context", "very, very fascinating", "i kind of put it aside for a very long time, and now it's very timely that you bring it up", "i should go order this because i'm getting back into examining sort of how to draw value out of that", "the author is carol anthony", "yeah, it's funny because i don't consult - you call it consulting the i ching - very often these days", "i almost carry it because if i see it\u00e9 i've looked at it so often, so many times over the years that i just look at it and i'm like, okay, i kind of know what the answer is for this dilemma i'm having", "that's awesome", "that's super cool", "i'd love to talk about your morning rituals", "on your ideal morning, what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like", "when do you wake up", "what morning rituals are important to you, etc.", "besides getting up and looking at my instagram", "oh, my god, did i say that out loud", "can you erase that", "just kidding", "what time do you wake up", "i usually wake up around 7, 8, 8:30 if i've gone out late or stayed up late", "i work late, and it's a terrible habit", "i'm usually hammering emails until i fall asleep, which is awful", "i've been trying to train myself to just read, which works every so often    but in an ideal morning, i would get up and one of the first things i would do would be to sit down and try to meditate and maintain that practice", "i'm not great but it's always been beneficial when i've had some consistency in doing it", "what type of meditation", "20 minutes", "it sounds like transcendental meditation, or no", "yeah, kind of a form of it", "i've kind of looked at and played with different forms of meditation but that form is kind of the type that i've been doing lately", "i don't even want to say that it is tm because it's more like a conglomeration of different things that i've learned and thought about", "then it's breakfast, which is usually toast and jam or granola and bananas and yogurt, something like that, or a smoothie", "then i just open up my laptop", "it's so boring", "i start looking at emails and saying to myself, oh my gosh, i've got to hammer these outbecause what i'm trying to do is get as much done as i possibly can in the first few hours of the morning because my head is clear, so that i can go run outside and do something in the afternoon", "is the morning, then, that is when you're mentally sharpest and you want to just knock stuff out before lunch so that you can get outside and run around and do whatever activity you want to partake in", "yes", "do you drink", "no, not very much",

few drinks", "if you walk into a bar, what do you order", "i usually order a beer and nurse it for a long time", "tequila is probably where i go if i'm going out to have a pretty good time", "tequila", "yeah, there's some good stuff out there", "casamigos, the casa dragones", "i was never a tequila fan because it turned me into a complete lunatic", "and that only changed when i stopped mixing it with other things", "unless we count club soda", "club soda is a fair mixer but if i combine tequila with anything else, it's just a recipe for disaster in my experience", "yes", "good tequila, though", "what $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in the last, say, six to 12 months", "a classic thing i always buy, one of the niceties that i might get is this lip balm, black jack lip balm", "black jack", "yep", "no, it's actually called jack black lip balm", "jack black lip balm, got it", "i've taken it on every expedition i've ever been on", "it's 25 spf and it's like one of the few things that keeps your lips from cracking on a really tough expedition", "so that's always nice to have", "yeah, that's simple", "jack black lip balm   i probably am not doing anything strenuous enough to warrant lip balm but that is probably an indication that i should get out and move my ass around in more strenuous environments", "if you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say", "that is a toughie", "i'll give you another one you can choose from", "it's funny because the two things that came into my mind immediately, one was chill", "the other one was get after it", "they are diametrically opposed", "i can see the conflict", "maybe you put them in different places", "yes, maybe", "i think that's kind of representative of the way i function", "i tell people i'm the laziest motivated person that i know because i'm either just wanting to completely kick it back, or i'm going 150 miles an hour", "right, trying to hit a first ascent", "yeah", "involving the house of cards and other things", "what advice would you give to your 30-year-old self", "i would probably say think of the long game", "because i freaked myself out so much, being like, oh, my god i have to do this, i have to do that, i have to do this", "i've always lived my life with a sense of urgency and sometimes that works out in your favor; sometimes you botch it and make bad, quick decisions", "as i've gotten older, i've recognized that life just has its ups and downs", "i mean the classic buddhist saying would be the middle path", "you don't get super excited and overconfident when something really great happens for you", "and you don't get completely depressed if something bad happens for you", "you just have to understand that life goes in these crazy waves and you just hold steady and put one foot in front of the other", "i love it", "and putting one foot in front of the other, that could be the subtitle of your latest film, also", "could you please let everybody know where they can find the film, where they can find more information online and then where they can find you online", "and of course, i will link to all of this in the show notes", "where can they learn more about meru and more about you", "i think the best place to look is merufilm.com, so m-e-r-u film dot com, and that has the list of all the theaters and other information about the film", "and then our handle on social media for instagram, twitter and facebook are all also merufilm, or @merufilm", "we're releasing online in november on itunes so look for us there", "and then for myself, it's just jimmychin.com", "as we all know, documentaries kind of live and die by word of mouth and hopefully people have an opportunity to see it", "and if they like it, please share the stokethat would be great", "yeah, you guys have to check it outmeru is spectacular", "we will chat maybe another time about how the hell you guys actually captured footage in a lot of these situations", "i think that's an entire conversation in and of itself", "but folks, check it out", "it's very well worth the time", "you know i love docs, and this is the best one i've seen in a very, very long time   check it out, if you want to be inspired, terrified, pee your pants just a little bit; it's good every once in awhile", "it's healthy for your bladder and urethra",
