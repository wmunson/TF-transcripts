This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where is it my job to deconstruct world-class performers of all types, whether they are chess prodigies, military strategists, entertainers, sports icons or otherwise. This is an in-betweenisode. That means that it is perhaps a little shorter than you would usually find my long-form interviews. We have a Q&A with Shay Carl. But before we get to that, I wanted to \u2013 what did I want to do? I had a little Alzheimer\u2019s moment there. I wanted to share an announcement, if you missed the big news. I have a new book that is coming out. It is available on \u2013 you name it, Barnesandnoble.com. You can go to Booksamillion.com and, of course, Amazon.com. Tools of Titans. The subtitle is The Tactics, Routines and Habits of Billionaires, Icons and World-Class Performers. It is the culmination of the last two years of this podcast. It is my favorite takeaways, the lessons I\u2019ve learned, the tools I\u2019ve applied to my own life from all of the guests, including some new guests you have not met, new tips and tricks from past guests. It is the ultimate choose-your-own-adventure guide to optimizing your life, everything. I mean, finance, physical performance, wisdom (I know that\u2019s a little broad), but it\u2019s got everything in it. So check it out, please. Tools of Titans. I would love you guys to grab one for yourselves and for the holidays, maybe as a gift or two or three or 25? So check that out. Tools of Titans. Now, back to this episode. Shay Carl. Shay Carl started off, I suppose you could say, as a manual laborer and he was working on, I want to say marble countertops or countertops when he started his YouTube channel. His SHAYTARDS channel now has more than 2.3 billion views. Celebs like Steven Spielberg have appeared, alongside Shay and his family. He lives in Utah. He cofounded then Maker Studios, which sold to Disney for nearly $1 billion. He\u2019s been married 13 years, has five kids, and has lost more than 100 pounds his overweight peak. This guy knows a thing or two about how to radically change the direction and velocity of your life in the right direction. So we did a Round 2. The first podcast took place after spending two days with Shay here in San Francisco; it was a massive success. Coming up on, I guess, a million downloads just for that episode alone. It left many listeners wanting more. So we solicited questions. Your most popular questions were answered by Shay. He tackled them in the way only Shay can. He covers many things: how to grow a YouTube following from scratch in 2016 or 2017; the future of ad revenue and sponsorships; how he balances capturing the moment versus experiencing the moment (something I\u2019ve asked him about myself); his greatest obstacles in life; lessons learned as a father; the one person he\u2019s love to record a video with; and much, much more. So two things: Check out Tools of Titans on your retailer of choice; it is available right now. And without further ado (as I always say after a long-winded intro), please enjoy this Round 2 with Shay Carl. Shay Carl: All right. This is for Tim Ferriss. Podcast Round 2. Our very first question is from Tony Lucas. Tony asks: If you were able to start fresh, no followers, no name for yourself, no previous knowledge and you had to just start from scratch, do you think that you would still be able to make a business out of YouTube? I have thought about this question and have many times during panels said no, I would not be able to recreate the amount of success I\u2019ve had. Simply because I was lucky enough to be ahead of the curve. You know, in any industry or business or product, there\u2019s kind of like a luck to just being there when it all happened. If you feel like you weren\u2019t there when it all happened, I felt that way as well. I remember always feeling like, when is my thing going to come around? It was like that scene from Dumb and Dumber at the very end, when the supermodels were asking for two oil boys to follow them around, and they\u2019re like, \u201cMan, our opportunity will come one of these days.\u201d You\u2019ve just got to be like Lloyd and Christopher. What were their names? Your opportunity will come. What\u2019s the definition of success? When preparation meets opportunity. So you have to be looking for that. So if I had to start all over again brand new on YouTube, I don\u2019t think I would be able to build the business that I have built, simply because I was there ahead of the curve. But yeah, there\u2019s definitely a way that you can make money on YouTube. If you hate your job and you think that video production is the life for you, there\u2019s definitely a way to do it. There are people that I know that they only get 30,000 views a day, but they have a nice little income from sharing their life or their experience. This is another question Corbin Smith asked: Is the daily vlogger space now oversaturated? Yes, and it\u2019s really hard to stick out. It\u2019s really hard to be different. A couple things. One, it\u2019s definitely oversaturated. Two, I know that marketers don\u2019t love the daily vlogging setup. They can\u2019t package that. Advertisers can\u2019t sell that to a TV show. They can\u2019t be like, well, it\u2019s kind of a reality show but there\u2019s not always like a story arc. It\u2019s just this guy who turns the camera on and it\u2019s him and his family for 20 minutes a day. But it gets a million views! But that\u2019s hard to sell. So they want more of packaged programming where they can see this is a series or whatever. But what I do think it an untapped market in daily vlogging is specific life daily vlogging. For instance, I would love to be able to wake up and say, I wonder what a gold miner does every day? Or what does a deep sea fisherman do every day? I think there are opportunities for daily vlogging in which you share a specific niche thing that not a lot of people get to see. So maybe you\u2019re a logger in Alaska. I know a guy \u2013 Mr. Safety \u2013 Corey Williams, SMP Films. He\u2019s been a YouTuber around for a long time. He now does daily vlogs living in Alaska. So if you\u2019re like, man, what would it be like to just pack up and move on out to Alaska? There\u2019s a guy doing that. He and his wife just had a kid and they\u2019re living in Alaska. Not off the land or anything, but you see what it\u2019s like to be in Alaska. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for that. So what do you do? What\u2019s different about your life? You may say, well, nothing, I\u2019ve got a boring life. Well, not everybody is the hash brown cook at McDonald\u2019s and I love those hash browns! I want to know the dude, when he woke up in the morning, what was he thinking before he went and cooked the best hash browns \u2013 this is not a sponsored deal, by the way. But you have a unique experience and you just have to figure out what do I do that nobody else does? That could be you work at Staples. That could be you live in a different part of the world that you may think is average because you have just been there your whole life. But people want to know. That\u2019s why people watch our videos. It\u2019s that voyeurism aspect of getting out of your own head. That\u2019s why we go to movies and TV and that\u2019s why art has been so popular over all of the species. Because we just want to get out of our own experience and evolve that experience by allowing other experiences in. So I think daily vlogging, even though it\u2019s oversaturated and may be a business that\u2019s going out, you still can build an audience. I still believe that YouTube is a cool place to meet fellow-minded people. You don\u2019t ever have to feel lonely again because there\u2019s lots of different types of people. So if you are going to give it a go, say I\u2019m going to try to make this YouTube business my business. Like I want to be a YouTuber. I would say you definitely have to go and look at all the things that the career YouTubers are doing. Where do they put annotations? What\u2019s an annotation? Where do you put links in the video description? Where do they have their intro? Just little things that you could mimic and those are marketing techniques and ways to promote other projects that you\u2019re working on. That\u2019s definitely something I would do is just do what the professionals are doing. That\u2019s, I think, the best life \u2013 well, some of the best life advice. If you want to be something, just do the same thing that a person that has what you want does. So if you want to be a fat, lazy person, do what fat, lazy people do. And vice versa. All right, good questions. Alexander Coffey asked: Recently a number of high-profile vloggers have been having issues with detrimental effects on their social and/or relationship lives as a result of the excessive time that is consumed by producing daily vlogs. Have you ever experienced anything like this? If so, what are your methods of dealing with it and how can they be applied to non-vloggers? Well, this is a question \u2013 it\u2019s a tale as old as time. People break up. Recently, there have been some high-profile vloggers that have broken up. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s specific to vlogging. Is vlogging detrimental on your relationship? It can be; anything can be. I said this somewhere before, I can\u2019t remember where. I basically listen to everything my wife says twice because she says it and then I edit it. If you\u2019re not too friendly with your spouse that could get annoying really fast. Those little \u2013 we all have them \u2013 idiosyncrasies that are all part of our personalities, whether it be loud and obnoxious like me, or maybe you say something the same way or you fold the toothpaste tube in an awkward direction. Whatever it is, those things come out when you daily vlog because you start to see those things, not only when you\u2019re trying to vlog things all the time, but when you\u2019re editing, speech impediments that you have \u2013 I\u2019ve noticed and I\u2019ve tried to take out the \u201cums\u201d and all that kind of stuff. I think vlogging is actually therapeutic. I think it can be helpful in a self-examined life. I think it helps you to look at your own personality and say, is that exactly how I want to be? Am I obnoxious sometimes or do I need to be more patient or whatever? So it can be good or it can really bring out those annoying aspects of your significant other. So it\u2019s love. Love is a verb. This is the best advice I have for relationships. You\u2019ve got to serve the other person. Love doesn\u2019t come from a magical song from a movie. It comes from service. So if you think about what a verb is. That\u2019s an action word. That means you\u2019ve got to \u2013 man, you\u2019ve got to buy flowers. You\u2019ve got to write notes. You\u2019ve got to put the note underneath the windshield wiper of your wife when she\u2019s parked somewhere. You\u2019ve got to stalk her. No, don\u2019t do that. But I was given a lesson yesterday about marriage. It\u2019s like, remember what you did when you were trying to get that girl to marry you so you could have sex with her? Why don\u2019t husbands do that stuff anymore? You probably tried to get her to marry you for other reasons too, but you remember your primal motivation as a dude. So think about that. Love is a verb. Do things. Be kind. Wash dishes. Change diapers. Then you\u2019ll have a happy marriage, happy relationship. Okay, next question. Fadi Sallah \u2013 who knows, I can\u2019t pronounce words right \u2013 asks: For the vast majority of content creators, traditional monetization strategies, like ad revenue and sponsorships, i.e., brand deals, seem unsustainable due to their low earnings per view. Yes, that is true. What do you think is the future of ad revenue and sponsorships? Do you think that will continue to be the primary monetization scheme for years to come? I don\u2019t know; nobody knows. We\u2019re all trying to figure it out. We\u2019re all trying to say, where is this business heading? It is true that trying to make a living just off of monetizing your videos \u2013 and if you\u2019re listening to this like what do all these words mean? If you make a YouTube video, you get paid on that video based on how many people watch that video. So I, as a YouTuber, could have one billion subscribers and I go to upload a video and hypothetically, that video is supposed to be sent out through YouTube\u2019s distribution platform to all one billion of my subscribers. In a perfect world, all one billion of them will watch because they subscribe to my channel, so of course they want to watch every piece of content that I upload. But maybe only 1,000 watch that video that I uploaded. And I\u2019m like, what happened to the other 999 million, whatever that number is. I have a little video here with 1,000 views on it. I\u2019ll make about $2.00 on that video. They have a thing \u2013 and this has been explained a lot of times in different ways, I\u2019ve done it in different places \u2013 but it\u2019s a CPM is what they call it \u2013 cost per mil. Or in other words, how much money do you get paid on YouTube? I make about $2.00 per 1,000 views. So if I want to give you this little piece of paper and say \u201cHey, run out and show this to 1,000 people and I\u2019ll give you $2.00.\u201d You can imagine how profitable that might be and how tiring that would be as well. So because of the internet and networking and the 8 billion people in the world, hopefully they will all get the internet one day, but you\u2019re able to show these videos to thousands of people and make money through the CPMs, but you really have to be getting a lot of views every day in order to be able to make some money to live on YouTube. So the other way YouTubers have done it is through brand deals or commercials for big companies, whether it\u2019s Nike, Reebok. Any big company you can think of with a brightly colored logo that you see driving down the main street of your hometown, they pay influencers (for lack of a better term), YouTubers, Viners, Snapchatters, people that have an audience, people that are willing to listen to them. They\u2019ll pay them big bucks to promote their brand. That\u2019s something that\u2019s brand new. Where previously advertising was traditionally done through newspapers, magazines, all the standard revenue \u2013 what\u2019s the word I\u2019m trying to say? \u2013 outlets. But now it\u2019s like this whole internet thing has blown up and advertisers or owners of companies that are paying to get people to see their product are realizing that these YouTubers, these influencers, these people with audiences, they\u2019re promotion is way more valuable than buying advertising time on a commercial of a TV show or before a movie or whatever. Because what is the very best form of advertising? Why don\u2019t you think about it in your brain for a minute? This is a multi \u2013 you\u2019ve got to think during this podcast. It\u2019s word of mouth, right? Any business owner will say, if I could get one of my customers to go tell their best friend about how great my business is, we\u2019ve made it, right? It\u2019s word of mouth. You want people to just be talking and be like, this is awesome! You got to go try Joe\u2019s Crab Shack \u2013 whatever it is, whatever your business is, what has traditionally always been the very way to grow a business is by having your customers tell their friends. With a YouTuber like myself, for instance, who has been making a video every day for almost a decade, I\u2019ve kind of created a pretty good relationship with these people who watch my videos. So for a brand or an advertiser to say, hey person who has four million best friends, could you go tell all of those best friends that really trust you because they\u2019ve watched your dog die and watched you make two human people and birth them out of your wife (that sounded weird), they\u2019re going to trust you. Will you go tell all these people to check out our product and we\u2019ll give you X amount of dollars? And of course, then you think, well how \u2013 the whole discussion comes like, how do you put a value on that? How much? And everybody\u2019s like how much, how much? How much will a giant company pay a big YouTuber? You can go to places like Social Bluebook that have a proprietary algorithm that takes everything into account. This is more than views. Like yeah, great. You\u2019ve got 1,000 people to watch your video. That\u2019s a measurable number you can look at right away. But there\u2019s other factors that advertisers are really starting to look at more than just views and subscribers. It\u2019s a thing called engagement. They want to see that whoever\u2019s watching or being part of this community is thumbsing-up, favoriting, commenting, what type of engagement? Are they touching the content in some way? Even if it\u2019s a \u201cskip ad.\u201d I thought I\u2019ve heard that you are even rewarded for someone clicking that \u201cskip ad\u201d button, because then the advertiser knows that person at least saw the product because they had to scroll their little mouse up there to click on the \u201cskip ad\u201d and they\u2019re more than likely to see whatever you\u2019re advertising there, so you know at least they saw the thing and had to click to say \u201cgo away,\u201d so there\u2019s value there. Where before you don\u2019t know if the person watching TV got up to go pee or to make some guacamole during the commercial break, so you have no idea if they saw the thing that you made went into their brain. But now, even on the computer, if they say \u201cskip ad,\u201d like, I don\u2019t want to watch this crap, they still saw the thing they\u2019re skipping, which will registers a oh, this a product on the market that is available to me. So this is valuable; this is very valuable. Then you\u2019ve got to decide how valuable is it? My job as a creator and as a friend of fellow creators is to say hey guys, let\u2019s make ourselves valuable because we\u2019ve been working for ten years to build these audiences of people who trust us. My job as a creator is one not to do a bunch of these brand deals. Like check this out, check this out, check this out, because then all of a sudden I lose that value with my audience. They\u2019re like, \u201cMan, this dude\u2019s just promoting everything. He must be making bank. I\u2019m not going to buy any of this crap he\u2019s slinging.\u201d So as a creator, and I suggest this to other creators, is be careful. Only do brand deals for things that you really love. Wow, that was a long question to how else can I get paid the money on the \u201cYouTubes.\u201d All right. Next question. Alicia Mauer English asks: How did it feel to tell the truth about alcoholism on Tim\u2019s podcast last time? Healing or painful or both? Did you find that telling the truth is a healing practice? Like how daily writing has been studied and found to be healing physically and emotionally. Yeah, anytime you can talk about your weaknesses or things that you\u2019re afraid of is ultimately going to be hugely therapeutic and help you make leaps and bounds in your personal happiness and struggle. You feel like you can be in a place to talk about the things that scare you most. Because that\u2019s what we\u2019re all struggling with is that stuff that we\u2019re afraid of. You might be, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of nothing.\u201d That\u2019s just because you haven\u2019t lived long enough and you haven\u2019t been faced with some realities that are part of your future that once you do gain a little age and experience, you\u2019ll be like, \u201cWhoa, yeah, I guess I\u2019m kind of afraid of that.\u201d But you\u2019ll see. It felt great. I wasn\u2019t planning on talking about that on Tim Ferriss\u2019 podcast. We were just sitting there in his kitchen and he gets you all loosened up by being all friendly and all of a sudden you\u2019re sharing your Oprah story with him. I don\u2019t know how it came up. We were just talking and I told him that was something that I had struggled with. I think that he had specifically asked \u201cWhat\u2019s something that you\u2019ve struggled with?\u201d That was something. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know though because I\u2019ve never exposed that or told my audience about that.\u201d He was awesome. He said, \u201cWell, if you feel like talking about it, that\u2019d be great, let\u2019s talk about it. But if not, we can edit it out.\u201d He gives all of his interviewees the final edit option so they can be like, you know, I don\u2019t feel great about this. Will you take that out? But after I said it, it felt good. I was like, \u201cLet\u2019s just get it out there.\u201d I was nervous, but then the feedback was awesome. I feel like I encouraged people to try to talk about their scars and about the things that are scary to them because they\u2019ll find that there really is a kind listening ear a lot of times. And maybe not. Maybe people have tried to open up. You have to do it. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to open up to the ones that are closest to you, right? Because that\u2019s where those fights come. But yeah, Alicia, it did feel great. We talked recently on one of our podcasts with the writing example that you gave. A great way to practice this without the fear of being judged by this person that you love is to try a practice of writing down all of your fears and everything that you\u2019re frustrated about and all that stuff on a piece of paper knowing that you\u2019re going to destroy it. You\u2019re going to tear it up; you\u2019re going to burn it; nobody\u2019s ever going to see it. I think that is similar to being able to talk about these things but without the repercussion and without the fear of somebody judging you. So try that first. Write it all down, man. Just say, I\u2019m going to write down the scariest, most painful things that I keep inside and I know I\u2019m going to burn it. But just the actual act of writing it down and seeing those words can have a drastic impact on how you feel about them. So give it try. Nothing to lose except for a piece of paper. That\u2019s not expensive. Okay, next question. Tim McGee asks: Shay, if you had two weeks to teach someone how to tell a better story on YouTube, what would that course look like? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever actually thought of curriculum for what teaching a good storytelling class might be, but I think it\u2019s way of thinking. I just remember as a kid, my buddy would be like, \u201cAnd then what would happen? And then what\u2019d they say?\u201d It\u2019s all about details. It\u2019s about those little things that maybe when you\u2019re telling a story you don\u2019t think of. I learned storytelling from my Grandpa. I think my Grandpa was a great storyteller. Being a good storyteller is just the ability to help somebody become present in a different situation. So how do you make a story exciting? You have to be passionate about it. So you have to pick the stories that you tell. You have to think they\u2019re funny. I think you can\u2019t just try to tell a story that you\u2019re not passionate about because that definitely reads. But it\u2019s details; it\u2019s the little thing like, \u201cand then she said this,\u201d but just looking past the story line and trying to read the subtext of maybe what\u2019s happening underneath the surface. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I have a great answer to that question. But the details and emotion. So if you\u2019re telling a story, a lot of times when I\u2019m telling a story, I\u2019ll be like, \u201cand this happened, this happened, but here\u2019s the frame of mind I was coming from. I was frustrated because this just happened and because that just happened, I was worried about this happening. Anyways, here I was, being,\u201d so you kind of have to have a back story. You have to have emotion attached to it. Why did this person feel like that? What was their motivation for feeling like that? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s something I would actually like to delve into because it is a very valuable thing, being able to tell a story. Just being able to communicate. I\u2019ve always looked up to people who could do that well. I think that was the very first thing that attracted me to Philip DeFranco\u2019s videos. I was like, \u201cDude, this guy can talk.\u201d And even if it is edited, it\u2019s jump-cutty. The way that it was delivered or the way that it was created was entertaining. It was like I am laughing and learning at the same time and to be able to do that is something that is a learned ability. You have to practice it. It\u2019s like your voice. I remember my Dad and my program director from Z103 said that your voice is like a muscle. You can work it out. You talk to any voice actor, they can inflect and come down and do all these different caricatures and impressions simply because they practiced it. They talked a lot. I am able to communicate a lot better because I\u2019ve just been doing it for ten years. And if you look at Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s book, he talks about how you become an expert is by simply doing a thing for 10,000 hours exactly. That\u2019s all it takes. So great question. Just tell stories, man, you\u2019ll become a better storyteller. Amy Gilligan asks: Other than having better shoes, how has money changed you? If at all? What does that mean? You like my shoes, Amy? I have been buying Jordans. I got somehow into the shoe game. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always liked Jordans. I thought they were cool. And apparently there\u2019s Jordans out there that are like $600.00. It\u2019s ridiculous. I have fallen into that a little bit. I would like to say money has not changed us. If I\u2019m honest, the reason I started YouTube wasn\u2019t for the pursuit of money, but the reason that I\u2019ve kept going so long is because of money. When I first found YouTube, it was simply an avenue of escape. It was this whole other world where I could type in anything I wanted: Green Day concert; Glen Pike skiing; whatever I thought was cool and it would pop up. The communication. Just like, man, I can talk to people. Just that first realization that I had when 200 people subscribed to my videos and I was like 200 people! These are real people with hands and opinions and favorite colors and dislikes in food. Who are these people? That first realization of, I\u2019m hanging out with other people on the internet. We are transcending geographical boundaries. Just because we\u2019re not in the same room, doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not actually really hanging out here. So the first time I realized that, that was the addicting thing. Then once I found out you can make money, I was like, I got kids, man. I got to pay for these kids to do stuff. Money was never the goal. It was just freedom. I was never like, I want to be rich so I can have all this stuff. I just wanted to be able to not go to work, right? I just wanted to be able to tell the guy who I called my boss that, they, guess what? I\u2019m going to actually go water skiing with my family today just because we decided we wanted to. I know that I\u2019m supposed to be in at work, but I hated that. I hated feeling like I was being controlled by a dude that I was tied to $11.00 an hour to. Like man, this guy can tell me how to live my life for $11.00 an hour? Is that what I\u2019m worth? So it was never about the money; it was about the freedom. I tell this story. The day that Maker Studios sold, the day that I for all intents and purposes became a millionaire, I remember looking in our account and it was like oh, geez. I remember my wife called me on the phone and I said to her, \u201cDid you see the account?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYes!\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cIsn\u2019t that cool?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYes!\u201d And then I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Because nothing changed. We still had to feed the kids. We still had to brush their teeth, change their diapers. It wasn\u2019t like \u2013 and I guess we could have. We could have said, \u201cAll right. Get on a yacht, we\u2019re out of here.\u201d But we didn\u2019t get that much money. I think a lot of people think that we got hundreds of millions of dollar. We did not. So money just makes you more of who you already are. So sometimes you see that people that win the lottery, for instance, they\u2019ll just run their life into the ground because all of a sudden they\u2019re just buying all the things they were buying before, but just in excess. So money doesn\u2019t matter to us. I like to say that. I\u2019m definitely motivated by it, but I like to think that it hasn\u2019t changed me. I try to be aware of that, because I don\u2019t want it to. So I don\u2019t want to just say, \u201cMoney hasn\u2019t changed me. I\u2019m still me.\u201d But maybe it has. Maybe it has in ways that I don\u2019t realize, but I don\u2019t want it to, so therefore I\u2019m conscious of don\u2019t do or say things that might make you seem like just a money-greedy jerk. And it\u2019s not like I am that secretly and I don\u2019t want to reveal it. You decide what kind of person you are. So if you see stuff like that coming out in you, you can be like, whoa, that\u2019s not how I want to be. Let me rethink that. So my goal is to not let money change me and just to use it for good; to use it to help others. I know that sounds like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s good for you.\u201d Yeah, I\u2019m going to buy some cool shoes too and a water ski boat. I\u2019m going to go on vacation and I don\u2019t look at the prices of things. The only time I ever look at the price of something is like if I want quality, I\u2019ll be like, what\u2019s the most expensive one? That must be the best one. Which isn\u2019t always necessarily true, but sometimes it\u2019s a pretty good indicator of what is the best when I\u2019m looking for my new camera or skateboard or whatever. So yeah, I follow Dave Ramsey still. I do not borrow money. I pay cash for everything. That\u2019s how I got to where I\u2019m at. I decided to stay out of the rat race. I cut up my credit cards. I didn\u2019t listen to the 90 days same as cash. I know people are like, \u201cWell, you\u2019re rich now. That\u2019s easy.\u201d Well, I started off broke. I was making $20,000.00 a year, but I just followed these rules. There\u2019s certain, specific things that you can do that if you just follow these rules, you can\u2019t help but to become rich. Save 10 percent of your income, no matter what. A lot of people have this 10/10/80 rule. 10 percent to tithing. If you don\u2019t believe in God or tithing, you don\u2019t have to pay that. Pay yourself 20 percent. But a lot of people do 10 percent to tithing. 10 percent to themselves, and then 80 percent goes to everything else. So right away, The Richest Man in Babylon, it\u2019s a little book, maybe like 100 pages I read when I was a kid. The No. 1 principle in that book was \u201cpay yourself first.\u201d You get a paycheck, whether it\u2019s a small paycheck, a big paycheck, whatever, you get paid somehow. Salary, allowance, maybe your Mom and Dad give you a few nickels to rake the leaves. I don\u2019t know what you do to get your money, but you do something. Whatever that money is, you take 10 percent off the top right away. You say, \u201cI\u2019m paying me first.\u201d You say what do you mean? That paycheck is all mine. No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s going to gas and groceries and food and you owe your buddy $5.00 because you lost the fantasy pool draft or whatever you do. But always, as a rule, any money you ever get, say 10 percent of that is future mine, like retired mine. Like sitting on a beach somewhere and not have to worry about all this S-H-I-T mine. So if you follow that rule from when you\u2019re 12, 13, 16, the first time you ever get your job, you always save 10 percent of everything, that money\u2019s going to grow little soldiers. Little soldiers out there fighting for you. And that\u2019s how The Richest Man in Babylon talks about this money that you set aside this 10 percent; these little soldiers that go out and work for you. You invest those and stuff like that. So what was the question? How much money do I have? Not a lot. But I\u2019m rich in blessings. All right. Next question. Amy, thanks for that last one; appreciate it. Tomos Owen, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s Thomas Owen, asks: What do you do to overcome doubt? That\u2019s a tough one. Because you go in fits and bouts with doubt depending on the morning, depending on the mood, depending on the \u201cOh, it\u2019s Monday.\u201d You do doubt. It\u2019s different for different people. I think it starts with your upbringing. You know, what did your Mom and Dad tell you? Did your Mom and Dad tell you that you could do it or did they tell you that you couldn\u2019t do it? I think a lot of it \u2013 more than we would like to admit \u2013 comes from our upbringing. The personal, internal struggles that we have. That might feel bad to some Moms and Dads out there. But a lot of the kind of crap that we carry around like self-doubt, fear, inferiority, anxiousness, all that I think stems from those developmental years of being a kid. That\u2019s why families are so important. That\u2019s why Moms and Dads are so important because we carry around a lot of this baggage for the rest of our lives. So how do I get over doubt? Some days you don\u2019t. It\u2019s like a battle. Everything\u2019s a battle. Happiness is a choice is a battle. Being confident in what you\u2019re saying, in what you want to do is a battle. A lot of the times it\u2019s a \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d kind of mentality. There\u2019s not a good tip or trick other than just do it. Other than just you have to tell yourself, do not doubt. Believe. Just hope for good things to come. I\u2019m always quoting Andy, what\u2019s his name? Shawshank Redemption. One of my favorite movies, Shawshank Redemption. He said at the end, \u201cHope is a good thing and it\u2019s maybe one of the best of things.\u201d Because without hope, there is darkness. You think about concentration camps. I remember I was talking about that book the other day. Like the only thing sometimes you can have it hope. Andy Dufresne said it. That\u2019s what you have to do to overcome doubt. You just have to say \u2013 and I always go back to this. I think it\u2019s a little jarring for people, but I\u2019m just like, you\u2019re going to die. If you have this healthy realization that you will lose the opportunity to have effect on the world because your body will pass away. It will give you hopefully not an anxiousness, but kind of a sense of \u2013 not anxiousness, I don\u2019t want to use that term \u2013 but of pro-activity, hopefully. Or you realize we have a limited amount of time. Regret is such a painful thing, so just go for it. What do you have to lose? You have to look at failures as just stepping stones. Because people are like, what if I mess up? What if I fail? What if I lose everything? Then that\u2019s like so what? Start over. You think about the guy who invented electricity? I don\u2019t know what all the statistics are. They failed 1,000 times. It\u2019s all about how you get up. Those little clich\u00e9s are true. It\u2019s sometimes just gritting through it. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have any better tips and tricks for you. But it\u2019s up to you, Thomas.

relationship", "okay, next question", "fadi sallah \u2013 who knows, i can\u2019t pronounce words right \u2013 asks: for the vast majority of content creators, traditional monetization strategies, like ad revenue and sponsorships, i.e., brand deals, seem unsustainable due to their low earnings per view", "yes, that is true", "what do you think is the future of ad revenue and sponsorships", "do you think that will continue to be the primary monetization scheme for years to come", "i don\u2019t know; nobody knows", "we\u2019re all trying to figure it out", "we\u2019re all trying to say, where is this business heading", "it is true that trying to make a living just off of monetizing your videos \u2013 and if you\u2019re listening to this like what do all these words mean", "if you make a youtube video, you get paid on that video based on how many people watch that video", "so i, as a youtuber, could have one billion subscribers and i go to upload a video and hypothetically, that video is supposed to be sent out through youtube\u2019s distribution platform to all one billion of my subscribers", "in a perfect world, all one billion of them will watch because they subscribe to my channel, so of course they want to watch every piece of content that i upload", "but maybe only 1,000 watch that video that i uploaded", "and i\u2019m like, what happened to the other 999 million, whatever that number is", "i have a little video here with 1,000 views on it", "i\u2019ll make about $2.00 on that video", "they have a thing \u2013 and this has been explained a lot of times in different ways, i\u2019ve done it in different places \u2013 but it\u2019s a cpm is what they call it \u2013 cost per mil", "or in other words, how much money do you get paid on youtube", "i make about $2.00 per 1,000 views", "so if i want to give you this little piece of paper and say \u201chey, run out and show this to 1,000 people and i\u2019ll give you $2.00.\u201d you can imagine how profitable that might be and how tiring that would be as well", "so because of the internet and networking and the 8 billion people in the world, hopefully they will all get the internet one day, but you\u2019re able to show these videos to thousands of people and make money through the cpms, but you really have to be getting a lot of views every day in order to be able to make some money to live on youtube", "so the other way youtubers have done it is through brand deals or commercials for big companies, whether it\u2019s nike, reebok", "any big company you can think of with a brightly colored logo that you see driving down the main street of your hometown, they pay influencers (for lack of a better term), youtubers, viners, snapchatters, people that have an audience, people that are willing to listen to them", "they\u2019ll pay them big bucks to promote their brand", "that\u2019s something that\u2019s brand new", "where previously advertising was traditionally done through newspapers, magazines, all the standard revenue \u2013 what\u2019s the word i\u2019m trying to say", "\u2013 outlets", "but now it\u2019s like this whole internet thing has blown up and advertisers or owners of companies that are paying to get people to see their product are realizing that these youtubers, these influencers, these people with audiences, they\u2019re promotion is way more valuable than buying advertising time on a commercial of a tv show or before a movie or whatever", "because what is the very best form of advertising", "why don\u2019t you think about it in your brain for a minute", "this is a multi \u2013 you\u2019ve got to think during this podcast", "it\u2019s word of mouth, right", "any business owner will say, if i could get one of my customers to go tell their best friend about how great my business is, we\u2019ve made it, right", "it\u2019s word of mouth", "you want people to just be talking and be like, this is awesome", "you got to go try joe\u2019s crab shack \u2013 whatever it is, whatever your business is, what has traditionally always been the very way to grow a business is by having your customers tell their friends", "with a youtuber like myself, for instance, who has been making a video every day for almost a decade, i\u2019ve kind of created a pretty good relationship with these people who watch my videos", "so for a brand or an advertiser to say, hey person who has four million best friends, could you go tell all of those best friends that really trust you because they\u2019ve watched your dog die and watched you make two human people and birth them out of your wife (that sounded weird), they\u2019re going to trust you", "will you go tell all these people to check out our product and we\u2019ll give you x amount of dollars", "and of course, then you think, well how \u2013 the whole discussion comes like, how do you put a value on that", "how much", "and everybody\u2019s like how much, how much", "how much will a giant company pay a big youtuber", "you can go to places like social bluebook that have a proprietary algorithm that takes everything into account", "this is more than views", "like yeah, great", "you\u2019ve got 1,000 people to watch your video", "that\u2019s a measurable number you can look at right away", "but there\u2019s other factors that advertisers are really starting to look at more than just views and subscribers", "it\u2019s a thing called engagement", "they want to see that whoever\u2019s watching or being part of this community is thumbsing-up, favoriting, commenting, what type of engagement", "are they touching the content in some way", "even if it\u2019s a \u201cskip ad.\u201d i thought i\u2019ve heard that you are even rewarded for someone clicking that \u201cskip ad\u201d button, because then the advertiser knows that person at least saw the product because they had to scroll their little mouse up there to click on the \u201cskip ad\u201d and they\u2019re more than likely to see whatever you\u2019re advertising there, so you know at least they saw the thing and had to click to say \u201cgo away,\u201d so there\u2019s value there", "where before you don\u2019t know if the person watching tv got up to go pee or to make some guacamole during the commercial break, so you have no idea if they saw the thing that you made went into their brain", "but now, even on the computer, if they say \u201cskip ad,\u201d like, i don\u2019t want to watch this crap, they still saw the thing they\u2019re skipping, which will registers a oh, this a product on the market that is available to me", "so this is valuable; this is very valuable", "then you\u2019ve got to decide how valuable is it", "my job as a creator and as a friend of fellow creators is to say hey guys, let\u2019s make ourselves valuable because we\u2019ve been working for ten years to build these audiences of people who trust us", "my job as a creator is one not to do a bunch of these brand deals", "like check this out, check this out, check this out, because then all of a sudden i lose that value with my audience", "they\u2019re like, \u201cman, this dude\u2019s just promoting everything", "he must be making bank", "i\u2019m not going to buy any of this crap he\u2019s slinging.\u201d so as a creator, and i suggest this to other creators, is be careful", "only do brand deals for things that you really love", "wow, that was a long question to how else can i get paid the money on the \u201cyoutubes.\u201d all right", "next question", "alicia mauer english asks: how did it feel to tell the truth about alcoholism on tim\u2019s podcast last time", "healing or painful or both", "did you find that telling the truth is a healing practice", "like how daily writing has been studied and found to be healing physically and emotionally", "yeah, anytime you can talk about your weaknesses or things that you\u2019re afraid of is ultimately going to be hugely therapeutic and help you make leaps and bounds in your personal happiness and struggle", "you feel like you can be in a place to talk about the things that scare you most", "because that\u2019s what we\u2019re all struggling with is that stuff that we\u2019re afraid of", "you might be, \u201ci\u2019m not afraid of nothing.\u201d that\u2019s just because you haven\u2019t lived long enough and you haven\u2019t been faced with some realities that are part of your future that once you do gain a little age and experience, you\u2019ll be like, \u201cwhoa, yeah, i guess i\u2019m kind of afraid of that.\u201d but you\u2019ll see", "it felt great", "i wasn\u2019t planning on talking about that on tim ferriss\u2019 podcast", "we were just sitting there in his kitchen and he gets you all loosened up by being all friendly and all of a sudden you\u2019re sharing your oprah story with him", "i don\u2019t know how it came up", "we were just talking and i told him that was something that i had struggled with", "i think that he had specifically asked \u201cwhat\u2019s something that you\u2019ve struggled with?\u201d that was something", "i was like, \u201ci don\u2019t know though because i\u2019ve never exposed that or told my audience about that.\u201d he was awesome", "he said, \u201cwell, if you feel like talking about it, that\u2019d be great, let\u2019s talk about it", "but if not, we can edit it out.\u201d he gives all of his interviewees the final edit option so they can be like, you know, i don\u2019t feel great about this", "will you take that out", "but after i said it, it felt good", "i was like, \u201clet\u2019s just get it out there.\u201d i was nervous, but then the feedback was awesome", "i feel like i encouraged people to try to talk about their scars and about the things that are scary to them because they\u2019ll find that there really is a kind listening ear a lot of times", "and maybe not", "maybe people have tried to open up", "you have to do it", "sometimes it\u2019s hard to open up to the ones that are closest to you, right", "because that\u2019s where those fights come", "but yeah, alicia, it did feel great", "we talked recently on one of our podcasts with the writing example that you gave", "a great way to practice this without the fear of being judged by this person that you love is to try a practice of writing down all of your fears and everything that you\u2019re frustrated about and all that stuff on a piece of paper knowing that you\u2019re going to destroy it", "you\u2019re going to tear it up; you\u2019re going to burn it; nobody\u2019s ever going to see it", "i think that is similar to being able to talk about these things but without the repercussion and without the fear of somebody judging you", "so try that first", "write it all down, man", "just say, i\u2019m going to write down the scariest, most painful things that i keep inside and i know i\u2019m going to burn it", "but just the actual act of writing it down and seeing those words can have a drastic impact on how you feel about them", "so give it try", "nothing to lose except for a piece of paper", "that\u2019s not expensive", "okay, next question", "tim mcgee asks: shay, if you had two weeks to teach someone how to tell a better story on youtube, what would that course look like", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019ve ever actually thought of curriculum for what teaching a good storytelling class might be, but i think it\u2019s way of thinking", "i just remember as a kid, my buddy would be like, \u201cand then what would happen", "and then what\u2019d they say?\u201d it\u2019s all about details", "it\u2019s about those little things that maybe when you\u2019re telling a story you don\u2019t think of", "i learned storytelling from my grandpa", "i think my grandpa was a great storyteller", "being a good storyteller is just the ability to help somebody become present in a different situation", "so how do you make a story exciting", "you have to be passionate about it", "so you have to pick the stories that you tell", "you have to think they\u2019re funny", "i think you can\u2019t just try to tell a story that you\u2019re not passionate about because that definitely reads", "but it\u2019s details; it\u2019s the little thing like, \u201cand then she said this,\u201d but just looking past the story line and trying to read the subtext of maybe what\u2019s happening underneath the surface", "i don\u2019t know", "i don\u2019t think i have a great answer to that question", "but the details and emotion", "so if you\u2019re telling a story, a lot of times when i\u2019m telling a story, i\u2019ll be like, \u201cand this happened, this happened, but here\u2019s the frame of mind i was coming from", "i was frustrated because this just happened and because that just happened, i was worried about this happening", "anyways, here i was, being,\u201d so you kind of have to have a back story", "you have to have emotion attached to it", "why did this person feel like that", "what was their motivation for feeling like that", "i don\u2019t know", "that\u2019s something i would actually like to delve into because it is a very valuable thing, being able to tell a story", "just being able to communicate", "i\u2019ve always looked up to people who could do that well", "i think that was the very first thing that attracted me to philip defranco\u2019s videos", "i was like, \u201cdude, this guy can talk.\u201d and even if it is edited, it\u2019s jump-cutty", "the way that it was delivered or the way that it was created was entertaining", "it was like i am laughing and learning at the same time and to be able to do that is something that is a learned ability", "you have to practice it", "it\u2019s like your voice", "i remember my dad and my program director from z103 said that your voice is like a muscle", "you can work it out", "you talk to any voice actor, they can inflect and come down and do all these different caricatures and impressions simply because they practiced it", "they talked a lot", "i am able to communicate a lot better because i\u2019ve just been doing it for ten years", "and if you look at malcolm gladwell\u2019s book, he talks about how you become an expert is by simply doing a thing for 10,000 hours exactly", "that\u2019s all it takes", "so great question", "just tell stories, man, you\u2019ll become a better storyteller", "amy gilligan asks: other than having better shoes, how has money changed you", "if at all", "what does that mean", "you like my shoes, amy", "i have been buying jordans", "i got somehow into the shoe game", "i don\u2019t know", "i\u2019ve always liked jordans", "i thought they were cool", "and apparently there\u2019s jordans out there that are like $600.00", "it\u2019s ridiculous", "i have fallen into that a little bit", "i would like to say money has not changed us", "if i\u2019m honest, the reason i started youtube wasn\u2019t for the pursuit of money, but the reason that i\u2019ve kept going so long is because of money", "when i first found youtube, it was simply an avenue of escape", "it was this whole other world where i could type in anything i wanted: green day concert; glen pike skiing; whatever i thought was cool and it would pop up", "the communication", "just like, man, i can talk to people", "just that first realization that i had when 200 people subscribed to my videos and i was like 200 people", "these are real people with hands and opinions and favorite colors and dislikes in food", "who are these people", "that first realization of, i\u2019m hanging out with other people on the internet", "we are transcending geographical boundaries", "just because we\u2019re not in the same room, doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not actually really hanging out here", "so the first time i realized that, that was the addicting thing", "then once i found out you can make money, i was like, i got kids, man", "i got to pay for these kids to do stuff", "money was never the goal", "it was just freedom", "i was never like, i want to be rich so i can have all this stuff", "i just wanted to be able to not go to work, right", "i just wanted to be able to tell the guy who i called my boss that, they, guess what", "i\u2019m going to actually go water skiing with my family today just because we decided we wanted to", "i know that i\u2019m supposed to be in at work, but i hated that", "i hated feeling like i was being controlled by a dude that i was tied to $11.00 an hour to", "like man, this guy can tell me how to live my life for $11.00 an hour", "is that what i\u2019m worth", "so it was never about the money; it was about the freedom", "i tell this story", "the day that maker studios sold, the day that i for all intents and purposes became a millionaire, i remember looking in our account and it was like oh, geez", "i remember my wife called me on the phone and i said to her, \u201cdid you see the account?\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cyes!\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cisn\u2019t that cool?\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cyes!\u201d and then i was like, \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d because nothing changed", "we still had to feed the kids", "we still had to brush their teeth, change their diapers", "it wasn\u2019t like \u2013 and i guess we could have", "we could have said, \u201call right", "get on a yacht, we\u2019re out of here.\u201d but we didn\u2019t get that much money", "i think a lot of people think that we got hundreds of millions of dollar", "we did not", "so money just makes you more of who you already are", "so sometimes you see that people that win the lottery, for instance, they\u2019ll just run their life into the ground because all of a sudden they\u2019re just buying all the things they were buying before, but just in excess", "so money doesn\u2019t matter to us", "i like to say that", "i\u2019m definitely motivated by it, but i like to think that it hasn\u2019t changed me", "i try to be aware of that, because i don\u2019t want it to", "so i don\u2019t want to just say, \u201cmoney hasn\u2019t changed me", "i\u2019m still me.\u201d but maybe it has", "maybe it has in ways that i don\u2019t realize, but i don\u2019t want it to, so therefore i\u2019m conscious of don\u2019t do or say things that might make you seem like just a money-greedy jerk", "and it\u2019s not like i am that secretly and i don\u2019t want to reveal it", "you decide what kind of person you are", "so if you see stuff like that coming out in you, you can be like, whoa, that\u2019s not how i want to be", "let me rethink that", "so my goal is to not let money change me and just to use it for good; to use it to help others", "i know that sounds like, \u201coh, that\u2019s good for you.\u201d yeah, i\u2019m going to buy some cool shoes too and a water ski boat", "i\u2019m going to go on vacation and i don\u2019t look at the prices of things", "the only time i ever look at the price of something is like if i want quality, i\u2019ll be like, what\u2019s the most expensive one", "that must be the best one", "which isn\u2019t always necessarily true, but sometimes it\u2019s a pretty good indicator of what is the best when i\u2019m looking for my new camera or skateboard or whatever", "so yeah, i follow dave ramsey still", "i do not borrow money", "i pay cash for everything", "that\u2019s how i got to where i\u2019m at", "i decided to stay out of the rat race", "i cut up my credit cards", "i didn\u2019t listen to the 90 days same as cash", "i know people are like, \u201cwell, you\u2019re rich now", "that\u2019s easy.\u201d well, i started off broke", "i was making $20,000.00 a year, but i just followed these rules", "there\u2019s certain, specific things that you can do that if you just follow these rules, you can\u2019t help but to become rich", "save 10 percent of your income, no matter what", "a lot of people have this 10/10/80 rule", "10 percent to tithing", "if you don\u2019t believe in god or tithing, you don\u2019t have to pay that", "pay yourself 20 percent", "but a lot of people do 10 percent to tithing", "10 percent
