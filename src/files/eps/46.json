episode of the tim ferriss show. for those of you new to the show, this program is really dedicated to trying to dissect excellence, to deconstruct how the best in the world do what they do best. and that can range from billionaire investors to chess prodigies, to stand-up comics, to seven-time new york times bestselling authors, and everyone in between, professional athletes, people from the fbi. it gets crazy.    this particular episode is an anomaly. this is an audio version of the random show, which is something i do with my buddy kevin rose, who's a general partner at google ventures, has also started a bunch of different companies, very, very successful angel investor and product guy, as they call them in silicon valley. and this is generally a video show. and the video, as well as the show notes for this audio can be found at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, all spelled out. fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. that's also where you can find all of the other interviews and in between [inaudible] and all that juicy stuff.   but there will be a couple of things that lack visual cues given this is audio, but it's a lot like a stand-up comedy cd. most of it should make sense on audio. so without further preamble, please enjoy the random show.  kevin rose: well, hello, welcome to another episode of the random show.  tim ferriss: number 279.  kevin rose: that's right.   tim ferriss: i'm tim ferriss.  kevin rose: and i'm kevin rose. we are your random guests for tonight. and we are normally the guests, so we're here at your house.  tim ferriss: randomly consistent.kevin rose: randomly at your house.   tim ferriss: and we are having what?  kevin rose: some awesome wine from our friend will harlanthis is the matriarch 2003. will is a buddy of ours. he gave us a bottle of wine. he actually broke this over to my house the other night for daria's birthday dinner thing after her birthday dinner thing. it's hard to explain.    tim ferriss: the after party.   kevin rose: we had a dinner the night after her birthday. he came by, dropped it off, didn't get a chance to crack it, so we figured we crack it here. and it's awesome wine.  tim ferriss: matriarch.  kevin rose: obviously harlan estates, matriarch, everything that he does is just like awesome.  tim ferriss: and we have a few accoutrement for the wine. number one, gifted to me by my girlfriend is a coyote head pourer, which may be hard to see here, but it comes right out the mouth hole like that, which is amazing - very game of thrones. looks a bit like a dire wolf. and because i know that it would just horrify will, we're using beakers. these are kimax beakers that i use for urinalysis in the morning typically, but not only. it's also a perfect 200 milliliters. i also have 250 milliliters, which means that you can get three perfect glasses in one bottle of wine because bottles of wine are typically standardized to 750 milliliters.    kevin rose: you've never used this for urine. that's right. that's a joke, right?  tim ferriss: probably not.   kevin rose: i wouldn't put it past you.  tim ferriss: you have like a one in twelve likelihood.   kevin rose: alright.  tim ferriss: alright.  kevin rose: so let's get right into the show people. we've got a lot of stuff to talk about. one thing i want to talk about real quick is a new announcement that i have. i've launched a new app. i have for the people out there that have watched the show, you probably know by now that i typically am a full time partner at google ventures. i've now reduced my time to part time at google ventures, and i am a full time entrepreneur now. so i have a little company called north. we build a bunch of different apps out there. high five. and this is our second app.   so our second app is called watchville. it's available at watchville.co, and it is basically a tool for kind of what i consider to be like an underserved market, like it's the watch, slash, watch enthusiast. and i'm talking about old school wrist watches, not like smartwatches.   tim ferriss: man jewelry.   kevin rose: man jewelry, no, it's not man jewelry. this is the thing about - it's funny you should say man jewelry because a buddy of mine - so the quick little 10-second version - and i've talked about this on a previous random show, but how i got into watches was that - it's a horrible story, but the first time i actually wore a serious watch was when my dad passed away. and he left me a watch that he worked very hard for, which is a rolex that he wore all the time, same one. he didn't have a lot of watches. he wasn't wealthy. but he had that one that he really cared about, and i would always watch him polish it when i was a little kid.   and i was left that, and i would wear one of - like his watch out when i was going out to like nice events and stuff like that. and i was like this is kind of cool. and a buddy of mine was like, \"you know, that's funny you're wearing a watch.\" he goes, \"it's the only jewelry men can really wear and get away with.\" and i was like, \"actually, that's a good point.\" i started reading some of the blogs. i started reading the blogs on mobile. and there was no tool that pulled together all of the best content, all the best like watch blogs out there, along with some tools for like actually setting your watch and tracking what's going on with it.   so the other side of the app, outside of the best news around the web, is a time setting tool, so current moon phase indicator, gives you leap year for watches that require that. it averages out all the different atomic time - atomic clocks out there, to give you the most precise time for setting your watch. and that's important for people that care about like is their watch running fast  or is it running slow, things like that. but it's just a free little app. if you like watches, or if you're watch curious or anything like that, i hope you'll check it out and download it. it's watchville.  tim ferriss: watch curious.  kevin rose: watch curious.   tim ferriss: like vicarious.  kevin rose: sure. if you're just like - you know, i was about a year, year and a half ago - i was just like, \"oh, that's interesting. i'm curious what it's all about.\" and then i started reading the blogs. and the first thing that you come to realize is that it's not about just like these - wearing a brand for brand's sake. there's people that walk into a store and they're like, \"i have to have,\" you know, name the watch. they put in like a [inaudible] or a rolex. and they just like buy based on brand.    when you really get into it, the geeks, the people that are the true collectors, they understand the movements, like they understand the watchmaker, like where they came from, why they make - i mean it's like people that are really into cars and engines and things like that. you go in there, they're like, \"oh, they use the blued screws there over you know, a quarter inch, like german silver.\"   kevin rose: you know, like they know every little facet of it. and it really is a geeky thing. like i'm a tech geek, and like i can appreciate the engineering and the effort that goes into this stuff, once you get into that side of things.   tim ferriss: i think it's also a really smart thing. so you and i were having dinner not too long ago, before the launch, at blue plate, which is a great restaurant here in san francisco. i highly recommend, go on a cheat day. have either the meatloaf or the fried chicken. and then the key lime pie is just amazing - best key lime pie i've easily had on the west coast.  kevin rose: we didn't have the pie.  tim ferriss: we didn't because it wasn't my cheat day. but we started about watchville, and watchville is so attractive to me for a handful of reasons, and maybe not the obvious ones. so i don't currently wear a wristwatch.    kevin rose: you don't wear anything, no rings - cock ring.  tim ferriss: just a cock ring. cock ring and butt plug all day long. working on my kegels, kegels  kevin rose: those aren't visible though, so those don't really count.   tim ferriss: no, no, i'm working up to the hand rings. so we were talking about it, and what i really like about this is the fact that it disproves i think a disabling belief that a lot of entrepreneurs have, or would-be entrepreneurs, like, \"oh, well, everything's been done. uber for whatever has been done, and there's nothing left.\"  and it's like no, there's so much left.   kevin rose: yeah, the long tail is left.  tim ferriss: yeah, and you found my favorite kind of market, which is a very precisely defined, easy to - relatively easy to target price insensitive high end market. and there's so much potential there. and you can make a lot of mistakes.   there's a certain like margin of safety. if you have really good tech jobs, really good design jobs, and neither of those have been brought to that world, and it's such an attractive way to go.  kevin rose: well, yeah, that's what i was going to say. one of the pieces i'll add on top of that, that i absolutely believe in is like if you're going to do something, if you're going to build something, there's a great book out there. peter teal put it out, called zero to one.   tim ferriss: yeah, it's right over here.  kevin rose: have you read it?  tim ferriss: yeah, absolutely.  kevin rose: so zero to one, he talks about if you're going to build something, make sure it's an order of magnitude better than what's already else out there. and if you look at all the other watch apps out there, they are  just -   tim ferriss: what already else is out there? that was amazing.  kevin rose: is that [inaudible] or no?  tim ferriss: no, but i get you. kevin rose: so you look at everything else out there, and it was all crap. i went in and i investigated because first of all, i'm not going to build an app if there's something amazing out there, right.    so, you know, honestly, there was like a couple little watch apps here and there. i put this out there, and it was like tens of thousands of people flocked to it, and it's been like five days old. and you know, hundreds of thousands of sessions, and it just goes to show you like if you build a quality product, like the niche - like people will - they're begging for an android version. it's just insane. so i'm pretty happy about it. but for other people that are out there, like to your point, like there's just so much opportunity in this like long tail of stuff that no one is touching.    no one has built an app for like high end, like these collectors of nike shoes, air jordans. they paid like $5000.00 for a pair of shoes. it could be anything.  tim ferriss: or whatever, it could be high end hats, high end -   kevin rose: well, it doesn't even have to be high end. it could be like you know, there's gardening apps.  tim ferriss: the point is - and i think also people get so obsessed with venture backed startups, they don't stop to consider alternatives to the traditional sort of venture backed game. it's like you don't need to have an ipo, a huge acquisition to build a massively successful company.   i mean you can be privately held. i think mars company is still family owned. you can build massive companies, or at least very highly profitable companies. you don't have to get caught up in all of the echo chamber and romanticizing of silicon valley. i think it's really dangerous and unnecessary. but we'll come back to that. i wanted to talk about just the setting for a second. so this is my house. and we are sitting at my living room table, i guess you would call it. and these are the books that were on the table.    i didn't add anything new, and i have stacks of books everywhere in the house, which some people dislike, but it's kind of my way of organizing things. so first i wanted to just give a congrats. this is a new book. you might recognize the name. so this is a startup that i advised, refinery 29. they're the largest independently owned fashion site, and it's massive. and they just came out with a book called style stalking, probably best suited to the women out there.   but it's really about developing a distinct personal style. and this hit the new york times best seller list. so they sent me a copy to check out, and i can certainly use all of the help i can help.   kevin rose: they're trying to tell you something.   tim ferriss: so a lot of these books otherwise, on this table right now are related to illustrations. so i wanted to just point out a few of them. this one is robert e. mcginnis, and this guy is amazing as an illustrator. he has done everything from the movie posters for breakfast at tiffany's, to the james bond movie posters, to - he's know as the king of [inaudible] illustration.   kevin rose: can i see this?  tim ferriss: yeah, absolutely. and they're so incredibly detailed and good. and i think they're discounted. the artistic value of what mcginnis did is discounted in the same way that sometimes norman rockwell's is discounted, because of how commercially successful it was.    and speaking of rockwell, this is another one for those of you who might be interested. this is power magazine. this is one of my heroes, dimitri klokov, for those of you -  kevin rose: let me see.  tim ferriss: this guy is a beast. but j.c. leyendecker, a lot of you may not know j.c. leyendecker. he was one of the primary influences on norman rockwell. and you can see his art is just stunning. and if you look at the brush work and the strokes, it's very elegant. there is not an extraneous line to be found. so some of you who go a ways back with me know that i fantasized for a long time about being a penciler, comic book penciler for about ten years.   so i've been getting back into exploring that. so charles gibson - this is the gibson girl. it's been relatively easy for me to draw men for a very, very long time. so i was a comic book nerd and got really good at that. but the female figure is sometimes difficult, especially if you're trying to draw a female figure that is not an exaggerated anime type figure with a waist that's that big, and breasts the size of this room and so on.   if you're trying to do something slightly more realistic, then this is just a fantastic guideline. a couple of others, and then i'll come back to the thread of the rest of our conversation. these are two very different books. this is really dorky, but i love this stuff. many of you will know, really into stoic philosophy, this is just epicureans and stoics, edited by the axios institute. it's pretty good. it wouldn't get my highest recommendations. and then the last book i'll mention on the table is a new one. this is actually by a friend of mine, alex day, the underground storyteller, which is really cool.   it's one of these rare books, experiential books that i enjoy. and i get sent a lot of books, and most of them are just not that good, quite frankly. this is about alex trying to ride every line and get off at every stop on the tube in london, and tell the history of each of those lines as he goes through it. it's fascinating.   kevin rose: that's pretty cool.  tim ferriss: so so far, it's very, very good. and then just a real quick, on the background here, every book here, as daria pointed out, nothing here is accidental. i'm very anal retentive and ocd. every one of these books, because this is where i look for a lot of my day, has been placed very particularly to illicit a particular response from me. so you have vagabonding facing out, you have bird by bird facing out, zorba the greek, musashi, dune, the magic of thinking big, and a handful of others.   kevin rose: what's the magic of thinking big?  tim ferriss: the magic of thinking big by david schwartz, it's an amazing book. i find that when people are failing to accomplish their goals, or generally suffering from a malaise in life, it's oftentimes because their goals aren't big enough. their dreams aren't exciting enough to them.    and the magic of thinking big was recommended to me by stephen key, who has made millions of dollars creating different products and toys, and licensing them to disney, nestle, huge companies, hasbro, whoever it might be. and it was recommended to him by a number of fortune 500 ceosand it's a super simple book, really inspiring. i've had it for many, many years. that copy is probably at least 15 years old. and i think the externalities of lie are sometimes under-appreciated   so for me, my external environment represents my internal environment. so if things are relatively neat, which i would say my house is right now, my mind tends to be well organized. if my external environment's a mess, then my head is usually a mess, my thinking is a mess. so that's where we are.  kevin rose: yeah, i would say the same way, like if you look at - i picture it as if you take your house and you rip the roof off, and you look down from like a bird's eye view, if you see just like chaos and mess everywhere like that, that's a reflection of basically my brain. like i feel when my office is like messy, i feel - it's gives you anxiety, too.   when you have a messy house, like you have like a little background anxiety running.  tim ferriss: no, it's low-grade anxiety that's persistent. you may not even notice it. so for me, when in doubt - this sounds funny - but when i'm having personal or business stress of whatever - when in doubt, just tidy your shit up.  kevin rose: you have a house cleaner, so let's get real  tim ferriss: i have a house cleaner for cleaning, but they don't organize my stuff  kevin rose: i mean they tidy up your books.  tim ferriss: no, they don't.  kevin rose: never?  tim ferriss: that's off limits. they're not allowed to touch my books.  kevin rose: you are anal retentive.  tim ferriss: no, i don't want people fucking around with the order of my books. so i do have people who - i mean the wood takes a lot of care and stuff, but i don't want to turn this into a fucking -  kevin rose: how much care does your wood take? like really, it's like every day.  tim ferriss: well, what i'm talking about here - alright, i've had lyme disease and i'm on like a million drugs, so i've been not partaking of the nectar of - the juice of life, this stuff  kevin rose: the will harlan juice.tim ferriss: oh, god, this is just getting better and better  kevin rose: let's move on to the next item.  tim ferriss: moving on, yeah, i'm very particular about stacks of books.  kevin rose: i brought you gifts.  tim ferriss: oh, you brought me gifts.  kevin rose: yes  tim ferriss: what have you got?  kevin rose: so the first gift i have for you, i want you to get a good smell of this. smell that. really pungent.  tim ferriss: weird. what is that? fermented coffee beans?  kevin rose: so these coffee beans right here - you see how oily they are?   tim ferriss: yeah, very oily.  kevin rose: so we'll put a link in your blog article to this.  tim ferriss: my blog article?  kevin rose: i don't know. you have a blog. i don't have a blog. blogs are stupid.  tim ferriss: how old are you?   kevin rose: so we'll put a link in your blog article to this little - so here's the deal. i'm going to tell you people something. just listen. it's going to my head, too. i'm going to tell everyone about this little place in tokyo. it's this little hidden coffee shop. my only ask is one thingyou have to understand that they don't speak english in there, and it's almost - so when you walk in there, there's no tourists. so when you're walking in, like just be - the best way i can put it is just be very polite. don't talk loud. don't come there with a big group. and just be on your best behavior. that's it.   you don't have to dress up or anything like that. it's a coffee house. but they're very like old-school. i go in there, there's this guy, he's probably -tim ferriss: what's it called?  kevin rose: what's it called? hatou. yeah, hatou. hatou coffee. so you go in this little alleyway, you go in this little coffee shop. and the only thing that you can tell this guy - he doesn't understand englishhe's like, \"what do you want?\"    and he hands you a menu and there's english menu or anythingand you say -  tim ferriss: that must be really helpful.  kevin rose: yeah, exactly. you say, \"old beans.\" and the old beans - he's like, \"old beans.\" and he goes - takes - is it racist to like say -   tim ferriss: it's not racist. that's pretty accurate.  kevin rose: i mean that's the way actually his accent.  tim ferriss: no, it's not racist  kevin rose: i don't mean to like -   tim ferriss: so chill out, internet.  kevin rose: i don't mean to like - this is how the way he does it  tim ferriss: keep moving, keep moving  kevin rose: so anyway, he's like - to me, he's like, \"takes 20 minutes.\" he didn't say it like that  tim ferriss: takes 20 minutes.  kevin rose: yeah, exactly. and so - but actually worse than that. so literally, he sits there and we'll splice in a videogram that's on my instagram account. i did  a hyperlapse of him  tim ferriss: what did you do, like 20-minute pour over?  kevin rose: twenty minutes for the pour-over, dude. i'm talking like this, going really slow.   and he makes this amazing pour over of fermented coffee beansand you know how - i mean talk about fermented foods for a  second, like what you know about fermented foods in general.  tim ferriss: well, i mean fermented foods have a lot of benefits. it depends in part on the format of the food, so you can grind things, you can consume them whole, like say sauerkraut or kombucha have different beneficial bacteria, among other things  kevin rose: and sometimes it makes the ingredients bio-available to you as well when the bacteria break down.  tim ferriss: yeah, some of them, i mean they have certain k vitamins as well that can be - or some people believe are very, very important for many types of health. and so fermented foods have a major part in my life right now because i'm repopulating my gut and my micro-biome after a lot of doxycycline, which is a broad spectrum antibiotic.   kevin rose: yeah, so anyway, i want you to repopulate your gut with some fermented coffee beans.  tim ferriss: these are the old beans?  kevin rose: these are old beans, man.  tim ferriss: what's the right way to brew coffee with these?  kevin rose: thirty-three grams of coffee, and do it -   tim ferriss: to what?  kevin rose: to 300 - it's a lot  tim ferriss: no, no, 33 grams to like 100 grams of water?  kevin rose: no, to 250 milligrams of -  tim ferriss: that bag won't last super long.  kevin rose: that's two cups basically.  tim ferriss: oh, nice, okay, cool. i'm down.   kevin rose: anyway, make it, enjoy it, ferment it. it's fermented already. i got you another gift  tim ferriss: thanks, alright.kevin rose: next gift is - i was just in tokyo for those people that don't knowit was awesome.  tim ferriss: do you know which part of tokyo the hatou is from? i'll put a link - we'll have a link to the actual place. there's a blog article for those of you might be getting some audio, is going to be at www.fourhourblog.com.  kevin rose: so this - have you heard of this company?   tim ferriss: lisn?  kevin rose: yeah, lisn.  tim ferriss: l i s n.  kevin rose: yeah, so this is a small producer of like these little freaking sticks  tim ferriss: sophisticated incense for listeners by shoyedo incense company   kevin rose: so it's all organic. all of these smells are non-chemical. they're all from plant derived. and look at all the different - this is reading - they all have different -  tim ferriss: oh, it's - wait a second. is this from japan?  kevin rose: it is.  tim ferriss: it's got to be because you got - 223 is for reading; 219 is for gorgeous. i would like to gorgeous. 249 is - just light that one up - 249 is continue; i'm really curious what that is. sweet masala ignous. i don't know, maoustay, sidewalk flash, silent blue, dive into the blue, and then amulet and avenue  kevin rose: can we light one of them?  tim ferriss: yeah, let's do it  kevin rose: so we got the little stone there that it comes with. i think we could use some - i think we should try continue  tim ferriss: this is cool, man.  kevin rose: yeah, it's pretty awesome. so if you like any of these, they all come in different colors. you can order like tubes of just that color.tim ferriss: this is cool. this is fun.  kevin rose: this is like a variety pack  tim ferriss: variety pack, yeah.  kevin rose: no, it's pretty awesome though. i like the fact that they - it's not like bullshit ingredients, like the lady was -   tim ferriss: it's not like arsenic.  kevin rose: yeah, she was like, \"listen, we don't use any like perfumes, like artificial perfumes or anything like that.\"  tim ferriss: there we go. bam. thank you.  kevin rose: yeah, so that's a - if you want to check it out -   tim ferriss: so that's lisn, l i s n  kevin rose: yeah, l i s n. i know they have a website as well, so you can type in like lisn incense japan, or something like that, and it'll probably come up on the web.  tim ferriss: oh, and then it gives you the ingredients, so continue is cinnamon and clove. selected scents by 100, offered by eight assortments. i don't know what that means. but [inaudible]. okay, so we were talking about ice baths and baths. i wanted to give people a tip because those of you who follow my nonsensical self-experiments and lack of self-preservation may be familiar with my love of ice baths. and ice baths are a bit of a pain in the ass, just logistically to organize.  darya: and literally?  tim ferriss: and literally a pain in the balls, if they don't get to your throat within the first 30 seconds.   and going to say, safeway, or wherever it might be, a gas station, to get ice, is a real pain in the ass. it's a real hassle. and i found -   kevin rose: i think he's going with this.  tim ferriss: i'm going - i have a punch line, which is i've never really used instacart, and i started using instacart for ice. and they will deliver 5, 10, or 20-pound bags of ice.  kevin rose: that's the weirdest fucking [inaudible] dude.  tim ferriss: and so i can use instacart, pow, one click -  kevin rose: you know that like that tim ferriss ordered 50 pounds of ice?  tim ferriss: - and get 80 pounds of ice delivered by instacart like that. it is amazing. it's been such a game changer for me. so instacart, thank you for that.  kevin rose: can you see the smoke in the camera?  it's ridiculous  tim ferriss: this is amazing, yeah, yeah. this is not for enclosed areas. oh, my god, stop, drop and roll. i feel so continued. so that's my tip for the ice bath. we were talking about a couple things.  kevin rose: what does the ice bath do?   tim ferriss: the ice bath is great for hormones like adiponectin for instance. if you want to increase fat loss, [inaudible].  kevin rose: you put them around your neck and stuff, you said in your book.  tim ferriss: yeah, if you want to go lightweight, sort of limpress style, if you want to go like burly, then you do an ice bath. and the way that i've done it historically is typically in a normal sized ice bath, i'll be using 15 to 20 pounds of ice. i will only sit in ice up to about lower nipple area. and i will read a book for about ten minutes, and then and only then will i go down -  kevin rose: reading fast.  tim ferriss: - to the neck, hands out, for another five minutes  kevin rose: why hands out?  tim ferriss: because you have a very high capillary density in your hands and your feet, and if you put your hands in, you're not going to last even 50 percent that long. so keeping the hands out is very helpfulyou look a little - i guess, what, anchorman.  kevin rose: no, talladega nights   tim ferriss: but that's how i generally go about it. i'm not a doctor. i don't play one on the internet. if you have a heart condition, blah, blah, blah, your head might explode. be careful, talk to your doctor. all right. this - we were looking at this earlier. so this is one of my favorite axes. and for those of you who -  kevin rose: who even has more than one ax? like most people are like, \"i have an ax, and i  chop wood with it.\"   tim ferriss: yeah, i have five -   kevin rose: you have like death axes.  tim ferriss: i do. look at this  kevin rose: that's like- that's for killing people. you don't chop wood with that  tim ferriss: well, i mean i would say that any ax could probably be used for killing people. now i do chop wood with this. but as it turns out -   kevin rose: when do you chop wood? you don't have fucking wood in your back yard?  tim ferriss: i have wood right here, man. it's too large for my very, very lilliputian fireplace  kevin rose: where do you chop it?  tim ferriss: out on my patio, which makes people feel unsafe in my neighborhood because it's very loud. but - so this is a sog ax, and sog is an interesting company. they make a lot of multi-tools and knives and whatnot. i have experimented with throwing axes because that's the type of thing i do in my spare time.   and it turns out most throwing axes are very chintzy. they're made very poorly and they break when you throw them. and by the way, having an ax and like rebound at you in five pieces is rather dangerous. so this ax, on the other hand, is very, very sturdy. i believe it was modeled after an ax that was used by gis in vietnam, and it's fantastic for throwing. of course, that's not what i recommend because you might look at the back side of this. on the drawback, you don't want to spike yourself in  the face, so don't do that   and just for you urban dwellers, i would also note that if you happen to be an american history ax looking guy like me, and you go to the park to throw axes to practice, you might have the police called on you   kevin rose: did that happen to you?  tim ferriss: no. if you have a girlfriend or lady friend who's willing to just like come along so you don't look like a psycho, and just like a stupid boyfriend, then i would encourage you to take that [inaudible]. but the sog ax is a winner.  kevin rose: it feels like a good ax.  tim ferriss: it's solid. it is solid. in other news, big announcement to make - kevin and i are getting married. no, we're not getting married. i am on instagram. i put up regular semi-nude shots of me in my underwear  kevin rose: this wine has gone straight to your head. i love it.  tim ferriss: that's what i reserve for snapchat, it's very exciting. but instagram.com/timferriss, two rs, two ss. and the first photo ever that i put up is of tony robbins, who is like eight-foot-seven, palming my entire head because his hand is large enough to palm my entire head  kevin rose: and he's on your audio podcast.  tim ferriss: he is on my audio podcast. anthony robbins is on my audio podcast on the internet  kevin rose: [inaudible] on that one.  tim ferriss: that's true. i don't have anyone. but yeah, tony robbins is one of many interesting folks. i had peter teal  kevin rose: i was your first.  tim ferriss: you were my first guest  kevin rose: don't think i don't remember.  tim ferriss: yeah, i appreciate that buddy. and it's gone really well. the podcast has been a lot of fun, in fact, and that's where i'm focusing a lot of my energy because i want to have not just well known people, but just like niche obsessive.kevin rose: who's your niche-iest that you've got - your obsessive niche-iest person?   tim ferriss: obsessive niche-iest person.  kevin rose: you've had daria on the show  darya: oh,  no, i thought you meant like people who like really niche audience.  kevin rose: no, i mean like have you had any of those people on that you consider to be really niche-y?  tim ferriss: i have, i think, in niche subjects, i had - the latest episode is a guy named nick ganju. you probably don't know. he's cto zocdoc, and co-founder of zocdoc. and he's really, really good at explaining making non-engineers or non-mathematically inclined people comfortable with computer science and math. he's really good at - and i was turned off of math in tenth grade by a teacher who just busted my balls. it was a real pain. so i was turned off of math at - in grade ten   but nick is one of the most recent. i'm going to have - and this is already recorded - the resident technology futurist for the fbi is going to be - is on the podcast.  kevin rose: that's pretty cool.  tim ferriss: it's recorded; it's just not published yet. and we talk about -  kevin rose: oh, i've got a guest for you. i've got a great guest for you.  tim ferriss: who do you have?  kevin rose: the iron sheik.  tim ferriss: iron sheik?   kevin rose: yeah, he freaking dings me all the time. he's like, \"i want to be on the podcast.\"  tim ferriss: really?  oh, my gosh.  kevin rose: he's launching a documentary.  tim ferriss: that could be amazing! kevin rose: he's launching a documentary in like two months, and he's like he's coming to la, and he wants to do as much media as possible.  tim ferriss: but he lives in jersey or something  kevin rose: yeah, yeah, like the iron sheik would be on your podcast, dude.  tim ferriss: that could be amazing. so if you have any suggestions for podcast guests, please let me know. twitter is a good idea. that's the easiest place. it is @tferriss, f e r r i s s.   i'm pretty sick of tech  kevin rose: you're tired of tech. yeah, you said you were tired of tech, like you've been talking about tired of tech for a long time  tim ferriss: well, now, in full disclosure, since we're having a confessional here, you've said the same thing to me.  kevin rose: yeah, well, i hate tech  tim ferriss: right, so sometimes we respond via text at various moments randomly with, \"god, i hate tech. i hate tech. fuck i hate tech.\" and there are various reasons for this. partially, you can't get away from fucking tech in san francisco. it's like you want to have a normal conversation about something else, and then someone - just like with - and by the way, everybody in silicon valley, just because you're  a dick doesn't mean you have asperger's. you can't blame being an asshole on having some condition you've never been diagnosed as having  kevin rose: dude, i literally had a phone call today with this lady from cnet, and she's writing an article. and she was like, \"i want to tell you about wearable tech, and where you think it's going.\" and i was just like, \u00f4i'm so tired of talking about this.\" and she's like, \"well, what's the future like with the iwatch?\" and i'm like what's going on, and i'm just like, \"listen, i don't need any more tech. i'm teched out.\"   like i don't need any more notifications on my wrist and all thatand she's like, \"oh, sounds like you're getting old, or whatever.\" i'm like - i think tab browsing was the worst thing ever invented. i think we might look back in like 100 years and be like tab browsing was a bad idea, and like just lock it to one tab because dude, have you ever gone off and like spent like - i literally - like this happens to me once a week. i'll be like 20 tabs deep, and i'll come back to tab one, and i'll be like \"oh, that was that email i didn't click send on that this person wanted like four hours ago.\"   tim ferriss: yeah, i have that right now. and chrome is going at like 1997 dial-up speed because chrome has like 30 tabs open  kevin rose: right, and multiple windows with other tabs behind them. and she was like, \"wearables, like watches.\" and i'm like, \"what is it going to give me, like a notification? [inaudible] do. i got that on my phone. it's in my pocket. what else is it going to give me, like your heart rate's at this? like, great. that's great, i'm working out.\"   tim ferriss: i do that.   kevin rose: i don't think we sound old, but anyway.  tim ferriss: no, you don't sound old. i think tech - and by saying tech, i'm going to take a three to four-month break on almost all angel investing  kevin rose: you're all about the breaks this year. you didn't masturbate for like two weeks - a month.  tim ferriss: month.  kevin rose: how'd that go?   tim ferriss: oh, yeah, you lost the debate on booze.  kevin rose: hey, how was the return to that? i bet you had a great session coming back in  tim ferriss: had like some makeup jerking  kevin rose: you're like, \"i haven't seen you in a while.\"   tim ferriss: you know, i got to say, it was pretty exciting.  kevin rose: special  tim ferriss: yeah, it was exciting. so the - but the reasons are multifoldnumber one - and you've seen this. going back to watchville, and tiny, is building stuff. and i feel like i can't - i don't have maximum excitement!  and i can't be of maximal help to the startups that i'm working with if i'm not on the cutting edge. and the only way that i'm on the cutting edge is by building my own stuff, you know, and being out on the playing field by battling it and punting the ball down the field. so i'm having a blast.  kevin rose: you don't want to punt  tim ferriss: fucking homerunning it, field -  kevin rose: just throwing touchdowns. punting is like when you're in a bad situation, and you've got to kick.  tim ferriss: yeah, i was going kind of world cup, but i hear you  kevin rose: okay.  tim ferriss: so that's one reason. the second reason is i feel like the general coaching in the startup world - and we're not going to take too much time on this - has gotten to a point where everyone is reading from the same pitch script, so you just get - like i get so many bad pitches from people who feel entitled. and i think that's a dangerous sign, sort of a hubristic sign.   kevin rose: so do you think there's a bubble going on right now?  tim ferriss: yeah, i do, i think.  kevin rose: but it's not going to hurt anyone when it pops.  tim ferriss: that's not true  kevin rose: who's it going to hurt?  tim ferriss: it's going to hurt the people who are getting way too much money with crazy terms, with bad businesses  kevin rose: well, it won't hurt them. they'll just go out of business and they'll move on to their next thing, right?  tim ferriss: well, i mean that would - it would hurt them and the people who have invested in them potentially. now i think there's great opportunity for companies that are say, in a space with three to five leaders. and there's one company that sees the writing on the wall, raises a bunch of money, is very lean in their operation against competitors who are not, and have really high costs, and lots of heads to feed; then i think there's a massive opportunity.   so i'm not going to stop investing all together, but i'm going to pick a handful of shots over the next three or four months, and i'm going to stop everything else.  kevin rose: so let me ask you a question. there's a lot of people out there that are entrepreneurs, that are wanting to start a business potentiallywhat is it that you look for then, like what is it - i mean you said already lean, but like in the pitch, when someone sits down with you, and they're like i have this idea, like what is it that you look for in the founder, their body language, the type of pitch?   you said you're getting tired of seeing the same old thing. how can someone stand out?  tim ferriss: the way that people can stand out, number one, is don't be in such a fucking rush. and i'm so tired of getting the like, \"we're over-subscribed, but if anyone would get this, we think it's you, and we're growing 30 percent month over month.\" and i'm like, \"oh, really, like search and replace. it's the same email i've had from ten startups this week.\" and they're like, \"we're closing next 48 hours; we could squeeze you in for 25k.\" fuck off, like that - if i'm really a good fit for the company, there's no overnight rushdo you know what i mean? and all of the best companies that i've worked with -   kevin rose: do they explain to you why? do they say tim, you could help us with x, y, and z, and we think -  tim ferriss: no, it's just a bluff. it's a bluff.  kevin rose: no, i mean when a good pitch comes in, is it like -  tim ferriss: oh, when a good pitch comes in, they've done their homeworkthey know exactly how things fit together.  kevin rose: so what do they say to you? do they say this is why you're a great investor? do they kind of spell it out for you?   tim ferriss: they would say, \"we're familiar with how you've done a, b, and c. we think that we're different. we know you're interested in this. we're different because of a, b. and we'd love to do something with you. there's no huge rush, but we might - we're probably closing around in the next x period of time.\" and they don't give me 48 hours notice. they give me like two or three months notice  kevin rose: right, because you're the kind of person that likes to think on things a little bit, spend a week doing your own due diligence  tim ferriss: yeah, i like to think on it and do due diligence for myself and anyone who might be backing me on say, like angel list, where i do most of my stuff now. angel [inaudible] forward slash tim  kevin rose: i think i'm slash kevin.  tim ferriss: yeah, i think you're slash kevin. so that's where i do most of my stuff, and you can see all my investments there. but the best companies want a good fit, and they want the right investors. they don't want dumb money with the stupidest terms. do you know what i mean?  kevin rose: uh-huh.  tim ferriss: and that shows a longer term vision. i also, in terms of founders, and i don't want to turn this into a i hate tech, let's talk about tech for an hour   but since you asked the question, the best founders are not arrogant. they're just not. the ones that i interact with, at least - and i'm sure there are exceptions - but in their interactions with me, they're not going to be immediately arrogant and entitled and prick-ish. and i just see a lot of that right now. and there is so much money flooding the market. there's an oversupply of money, and undersupply of really good talent. and it's impossible for me to foresee in the next two to three years, there isn't a major correction because it doesn't take a million people - ten million people to believe there's a bubble for there to be a bubble   it takes a handful of hedge fund managers to liquidate 20 to 30 percent of their tech holdings. that's it. and all that takes is a string of bad ipos, a string of really high profile catastrophes of some other nature, that's it. so for me, the smart people, as entrepreneurs, and the smart as investors, are budgeting for that   but at the end of the day, i am having so much fun building. and it's been so long since i've -   kevin rose: what's your next thing? everyone like, you know, they - tim ferriss: yeah, you know, i am not sure what my next thing is. i am trying to be comfortable in that in-between space because historically i've always wanted that one thing, and it's helpful to have that because i'm - it's easy to drown in the cool stuff, meaning - a friend of mine, derek sivers has said, and he's also written about this; your decision should be hell yes, or no. like if it isn't like hell yes, fuck yeah, i want to do that, or no. where you get killed, and i think where i've been killing myself is like, \"oh, that's pretty cool, yeah, sure, i'll do that.\"  like oh, somebody asks a favor, like, \"oh, that's kind of cool. yeah, sure, i'll do that.\"  and you commit to ten of those, you're really stressed out. you don't have a lot of time. and you're not doing anything that you're really super 10-out-of-10 psyched about   so for me, right now, i'm dialing back on a lot of things, and saying no to the startup investing for three to four months because i'm not a momentum trader, right. i'm not in it for the next six months like a lot of the fair weather angel investors out there. i've been doing this for whatever, seven years, eight years; i'm going to be doing it for the next 10, 15, 20 years. i can wait three to four months. i think that if there are - you know, people throw these number out   there are 15 or 13, or 23 kind of billion-dollar-plus companies that come through silicon valley every year. you don't need to get every one of those. you don't even need to get one of those every year. you hit - you get one awesome bet every year or two as an individual investor, with a fund that i don't have allocate over a set period of time, you're great. you're ahead of 99 percent of the people out there    kevin rose: so the people are out there and they want to get involved, i mean angel list is probably your best bet for going out? i would say so, as far as going out and finding -  tim ferriss: i think angel list is a great way to find good investors. i think it's a great way to find good companies. and of course, i may be biased. i'm an advisor to angel list itself, but i think - i've never seen anything like it. i mean i just closed a $1.5 million round for a company called md insider, and the whole thing was allocated in one day. and it just simplifies the whole process.  kevin rose: the one other thing i've had, is i've had people that have come up to me and said like you know, i don't have the money to angel invest, like how do i get involved in the tech phenomenon that's going on? and i always have the same recommendation. it's like if you have something that you're really good at, like you're the best at - you know, i'm good at marketing, or i'm good at social media, or whatever it may be that is your thing, like just go after these young startups that don't have that person, and offer your services.   i have a guy right now that's helping me out with customer service. he's awesome, this guy forrest. he's amazing. and he was like - he approached me, and he's like, \"listen, i'll work for free if you want, like what do you want?\" and he just wants a foot in the door, some stock options eventually, like that kind of thingand it's like if you have a skill out there, and you don't have the funds to go out and be your own angel investor, there's still ways for you to get involved in these companies very early on. and i mean that's how you hear about these stories. there's a reason why the secretaries at microsoft were all multi-millionaires. that was like a huge story that came out back in the nineties. it's like there's other ways for you get involved. it doesn't have to be through big checks  tim ferriss: yeah, i think that's very good advice. and angel list is actually - i just saw an article. it was \"how i got 30 consulting gigs in 30 days using angel list.\" there was a piece about it. and i think this is a very smart approach.    so for instance, if you were to not try to sign on immediately for a full time job, but do contract work for a half a dozen or a dozen fast growing companies -  kevin rose: this is what david prager does. he goes out and he shoots videos for them.  tim ferriss: this is a mutual friend of ours.  kevin rose: yeah, i mean he used to be on revision three and some of the other stuff i did. but he went out and he shoots these videos. he started videos for companies, and if there's a really cool company, he'll say like, \"you know what, i'll reduce your rates, but just give me some advisory shares.\"  it's the same idea that the guy from facebook that painted all the murals, made like $250 million, something crazy because he took all stock from zuckerberg when he was painting their murals in their office. so anyway, that's kind of where you were going, right?  tim ferriss: yeah, that's where i was going. and then what you can do is when you do an amazing bang-up job for half a dozen startups, and let's just say four of them are like, \"you know, we'd love to hire you on a more ongoing basis,\" then you can take a look at those people who are hot to trot, and ask for advisory shares or equity, or maybe even pull - you know, choose a full time gig, which is what i advised a very young guy to do not long ago.   he actually had - he wanted to work with me, or he had a couple of other options. and one of them was stripe. and this was quite a while ago. and i said, \"take the stripe job.\" and i was like, \"they like you. take the stripe job, like that's a good horse to bet on.\" and he's pretty happy with it at the moment  kevin rose: that's awesome  tim ferriss: but what else is happening?   kevin rose: yeah, so this is like my last thing i have to talk about and we can wrap up or i'm sure you probably have something else, but this book a buddy of mine recommended to me. i have not read it. i brought it along because i just got it in the mail and it was in my bag anyway. but i figured i'd ask you - no, no, no, honestly, i was going to ask you if you had ever heard of it.  tim ferriss: i've read it multiple times.  kevin rose: yeah, and so then you said you've read it multiple times, and i'm like, \"well, maybe you should talk about it because i'm about to read this.\" what am i about to get myself into? and daria just finished it - my wife just finished this book a couple days ago, right?   darya: because rahmet sayte is on your podcast - recommended it on your podcast, i'm pretty sure.  tim ferriss: yeah, that sounds right. so this is influence: the psychology of persuasion by robert b. cialdini. a lot of people say it that way, cialdini, right, it's a ch, italian fellow, phd. so the cover quote is \"for marketers, it's among the most important books written in the last ten years.\" and it's a fascinating look at the psychological dynamics that companies and people use in selling services or products; how those can be used against you, how you can implement those for good in your own company, and it touches on things like scarcity, time restrictions, social proof, etcetera.  kevin rose: i can't wait to read this. i'm really excited. tim ferriss: and it offers what i think is a very helpful checklist for any type of product launch or say, message or copy editing. so if you have copy and you -  kevin rose: oh, you must have loved this.  tim ferriss: - [inaudible] on a home page, then - or you're making an offer, or you're doing a product launch, or you're doing an email sequence for whatever, or even implementing facebook ads or something like that, i think that this offers a very good checklist for the components that lead to compelling offers  kevin rose: you just finished this book two days ago. is there anything you want to add to that, like anything that you took away from the book?  darya: it's also - i mean that's all absolutely true. it's also really interesting just in terms of human psychology because it's important to remember that people have a lot of different motivations for doing things, and it really goes through the basis of understanding how to get people to act   and when you're in my space, or any - i mean it's for marketing, yeah, but also like i just want to get people to eat healthy. and it's like for that, it's incredibly valuable  kevin rose: cool. i'm excited. i can't wait.  tim ferriss: no, it's a - i think a very helpful book. it's a seminal book that's influenced many other books, and whether you're looking at mystery and the mystery method for pickup artists, or you're looking at how - let's say, why common air companies are coached to pitch investors, or you look at how to get people to change their diet when they've resisted it for 20 years, they all - all of the dynamics - the psychological dynamics that make any of those things successful boil down to a handful a principles, which in general are covered in this book. so this is not necessarily industry specific, which makes it very valuable because you can apply it wherever you want to.   kevin rose: cool. that's all i got. anything else?   tim ferriss: you know, i don't.  kevin rose: chop some wood?tim ferriss: i don't think so. yeah, i got some almond wood, which is good for burning.  kevin rose: what are you doing for thanksgiving?  tim ferriss: good for cooking.  kevin rose: we're about to go into thanksgiving.  tim ferriss: we are moving into thanksgiving.  kevin rose: i'm smoking a turkey  tim ferriss: i'll be headed to the east coast to have thanksgiving with my family.  kevin rose: awesome  tim ferriss: which i'm very excited about. i have a new wood stove coming in from vermont castings. did a bunch of homework. there are a number of really good companies out there, but decided on thatand i'm excited for a little bit of brisk cold on the east coast. i don't like to live in the cold all the time, but -  kevin rose: i know what you mean. i was just in new york a few days ago, and it was like it was nice.  tim ferriss: yeah, it's crisp. it wakes you up. it's nice.  kevin rose: nipples get hard   tim ferriss: it's good, levels up the nipples, brings them to attention. so i like thanksgiving and christmas for that. i'm very - just for nipples - nipple erections. but that's - i think on that note, really, i've covered all the bases this time around  kevin rose: graham, anything to add before we go?  happy thanksgiving  graham: have you guys seen the too many cooks?   tim ferriss: no.  kevin rose: too many cooks, what is it?  graham: it's an adult swim thing aired at 4:00 a.m. in the middle of the night, and it's this parody of old \u00f480s tv shows where they have the credits of the folks that are in the show, and like you know, like they'll be doing something, and they'll look up, and their name will be on the screen, and they'll like smile at the camera.   but this is an 11-minute long parody of that, that slowly devolves into like a really interesting horror movie. and i think that you guys would enjoy it, so go check - like go watch it.  tim ferriss: too many cooks.  graham: too many cooks. the song will be - i apologize in advance. the song will be stuck in your head for weeks, but that was great.  kevin rose: it aired at 4:00 a.m.?  graham: it aired at 4:00 a.m.  kevin rose: and they were just like screw it, we're going to put it up.  graham: immediately when it aired at 4:00 a.m., it immediately went viral the next day.  kevin rose: no way.  graham: it's got over like two or three million views, and it's the creepiest, funniest, like amazing - you've got to see it. it's really good.  kevin rose: awesome. that's a great recommendation, yeah   tim ferriss: too many cooks, check it out. and happy thanksgiving everyone, even if you are not in \u00f4merica. be thankful. take the occasion of all the yanks eating their turkeys, or tofu-made, textured vegetable protein, god knows what here in san francisco. and think of what you're grateful for. i'm not trying to get too deepak chopra on you. i'm just saying. i think it's common for - i think it's common for type a personalities - i don't know where i'm going with this - type a personalities to be very focused on achievement, and it's easy to recognize that you've done so much, you haven't taken any time to appreciate any of it.   and i think for just general peace of mind and quality of life, it's really helpful to take some time, even if it's just a minute before meals, grace style, even if you're not religious, to be thankful, and make a list of those things. so - and in fact, there's a really cool type of meditation that is sometimes called gratitude meditation, or compassion meditation, closely related, that's very interesting!  but we'll save that for another session. so happy thanksgiving, even if you're not in the united states of america  kevin rose: peace out. see you soon.", "speakers": ["kevin rose", "tim ferriss"], "text_sentences": [" hello, boys and girls, this is tim ferriss", "and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show", "for those of you new to the show, this program is really dedicated to trying to dissect excellence, to deconstruct how the best in the world do what they do best", "and that can range from billionaire investors to chess prodigies, to stand-up comics, to seven-time new york times bestselling authors, and everyone in between, professional athletes, people from the fbi", "it gets crazy", "this particular episode is an anomaly", "this is an audio version of the random show, which is something i do with my buddy kevin rose, who's a general partner at google ventures, has also started a bunch of different companies, very, very successful angel investor and product guy, as they call them in silicon valley", "and this is generally a video show", "and the video, as well as the show notes for this audio can be found at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast, all spelled out", "fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "that's also where you can find all of the other interviews and in between [inaudible] and all that juicy stuff", "but there will be a couple of things that lack visual cues given this is audio, but it's a lot like a stand-up comedy cd", "most of it should make sense on audio", "so without further preamble, please enjoy the random show", "well, hello, welcome to another episode of the random show", "number 279", "that's right", "i'm tim ferriss", "and i'm kevin rose", "we are your random guests for tonight", "and we are normally the guests, so we're here at your house", "randomly consistent.randomly at your house", "and we are having what", "some awesome wine from our friend will harlanthis is the matriarch 2003", "will is a buddy of ours", "he gave us a bottle of wine", "he actually broke this over to my house the other night for daria's birthday dinner thing after her birthday dinner thing", "it's hard to explain", "the after party", "we had a dinner the night after her birthday", "he came by, dropped it off, didn't get a chance to crack it, so we figured we crack it here", "and it's awesome wine", "matriarch", "obviously harlan estates, matriarch, everything that he does is just like awesome", "and we have a few accoutrement for the wine", "number one, gifted to me by my girlfriend is a coyote head pourer, which may be hard to see here, but it comes right out the mouth hole like that, which is amazing -

you get one awesome bet every year or two as an individual investor, with a fund that i don't have allocate over a set period of time, you're great", "you're ahead of 99 percent of the people out there    so the people are out there and they want to get involved, i mean angel list is probably your best bet for going out", "i would say so, as far as going out and finding -  i think angel list is a great way to find good investors", "i think it's a great way to find good companies", "and of course, i may be biased", "i'm an advisor to angel list itself, but i think - i've never seen anything like it", "i mean i just closed a $1.5 million round for a company called md insider, and the whole thing was allocated in one day", "and it just simplifies the whole process", "the one other thing i've had, is i've had people that have come up to me and said like you know, i don't have the money to angel invest, like how do i get involved in the tech phenomenon that's going on", "and i always have the same recommendation", "it's like if you have something that you're really good at, like you're the best at - you know, i'm good at marketing, or i'm good at social media, or whatever it may be that is your thing, like just go after these young startups that don't have that person, and offer your services", "i have a guy right now that's helping me out with customer service", "he's awesome, this guy forrest", "he's amazing", "and he was like - he approached me, and he's like, \"listen, i'll work for free if you want, like what do you want?\" and he just wants a foot in the door, some stock options eventually, like that kind of thingand it's like if you have a skill out there, and you don't have the funds to go out and be your own angel investor, there's still ways for you to get involved in these companies very early on", "and i mean that's how you hear about these stories", "there's a reason why the secretaries at microsoft were all multi-millionaires", "that was like a huge story that came out back in the nineties", "it's like there's other ways for you get involved", "it doesn't have to be through big checks  yeah, i think that's very good advice", "and angel list is actually - i just saw an article", "it was \"how i got 30 consulting gigs in 30 days using angel list.\" there was a piece about it", "and i think this is a very smart approach", "so for instance, if you were to not try to sign on immediately for a full time job, but do contract work for a half a dozen or a dozen fast growing companies -  this is what david prager does", "he goes out and he shoots videos for them", "this is a mutual friend of ours", "yeah, i mean he used to be on revision three and some of the other stuff i did", "but he went out and he shoots these videos", "he started videos for companies, and if there's a really cool company, he'll say like, \"you know what, i'll reduce your rates, but just give me some advisory shares.\"  it's the same idea that the guy from facebook that painted all the murals, made like $250 million, something crazy because he took all stock from zuckerberg when he was painting their murals in their office", "so anyway, that's kind of where you were going, right", "yeah, that's where i was going", "and then what you can do is when you do an amazing bang-up job for half a dozen startups, and let's just say four of them are like, \"you know, we'd love to hire you on a more ongoing basis,\" then you can take a look at those people who are hot to trot, and ask for advisory shares or equity, or maybe even pull - you know, choose a full time gig, which is what i advised a very young guy to do not long ago", "he actually had - he wanted to work with me, or he had a couple of other options", "and one of them was stripe", "and this was quite a while ago", "and i said, \"take the stripe job.\" and i was like, \"they like you", "take the stripe job, like that's a good horse to bet on.\" and he's pretty happy with it at the moment  that's awesome  but what else is happening", "yeah, so this is like my last thing i have to talk about and we can wrap up or i'm sure you probably have something else, but this book a buddy of mine recommended to me", "i have not read it", "i brought it along because i just got it in the mail and it was in my bag anyway", "but i figured i'd ask you - no, no, no, honestly, i was going to ask you if you had ever heard of it", "i've read it multiple times", "yeah, and so then you said you've read it multiple times, and i'm like, \"well, maybe you should talk about it because i'm about to read this.\" what am i about to get myself into", "and daria just finished it - my wife just finished this book a couple days ago, right", "darya: because rahmet sayte is on your podcast - recommended it on your podcast, i'm pretty sure", "yeah, that sounds right", "so this is influence: the psychology of persuasion by robert b", "cialdini", "a lot of people say it that way, cialdini, right, it's a ch, italian fellow, phd", "so the cover quote is \"for marketers, it's among the most important books written in the last ten years.\" and it's a fascinating look at the psychological dynamics that companies and people use in selling services or products; how those can be used against you, how you can implement those for good in your own company, and it touches on things like scarcity, time restrictions, social proof, etcetera", "i can't wait to read this", "i'm really excited", "and it offers what i think is a very helpful checklist for any type of product launch or say, message or copy editing", "so if you have copy and you -  oh, you must have loved this", "- [inaudible] on a home page, then - or you're making an offer, or you're doing a product launch, or you're doing an email sequence for whatever, or even implementing facebook ads or something like that, i think that this offers a very good checklist for the components that lead to compelling offers  you just finished this book two days ago", "is there anything you want to add to that, like anything that you took away from the book", "darya: it's also - i mean that's all absolutely true", "it's also really interesting just in terms of human psychology because it's important to remember that people have a lot of different motivations for doing things, and it really goes through the basis of understanding how to get people to act   and when you're in my space, or any - i mean it's for marketing, yeah, but also like i just want to get people to eat healthy", "and it's like for that, it's incredibly valuable  cool", "i'm excited", "i can't wait", "no, it's a - i think a very helpful book", "it's a seminal book that's influenced many other books, and whether you're looking at mystery and the mystery method for pickup artists, or you're looking at how - let's say, why common air companies are coached to pitch investors, or you look at how to get people to change their diet when they've resisted it for 20 years, they all - all of the dynamics - the psychological dynamics that make any of those things successful boil down to a handful a principles, which in general are covered in this book", "so this is not necessarily industry specific, which makes it very valuable because you can apply it wherever you want to", "cool", "that's all i got", "anything else", "you know, i don't", "chop some wood?i don't think so", "yeah, i got some almond wood, which is good for burning", "what are you doing for thanksgiving", "good for cooking", "we're about to go into thanksgiving", "we are moving into thanksgiving", "i'm smoking a turkey  i'll be headed to the east coast to have thanksgiving with my family", "awesome  which i'm very excited about", "i have a new wood stove coming in from vermont castings", "did a bunch of homework", "there are a number of really good companies out there, but decided on thatand i'm excited for a little bit of brisk cold on the east coast", "i don't like to live in the cold all the time, but -
