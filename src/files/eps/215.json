Usually it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers of different types from the military to entertainment, sports, and beyond. This time around, you are actually doing the job for me. This is a format that is often requested, and it is round two with Whitney Cummings in this case, the hilarious Whitney Cummings, @WhitneyCummings on Twitter, and WhitneyCummings.Com. She\u2019s back, and you have selected the questions that you would most like her to ask. Her first episode was a smash hit. And for those who don\u2019t have the context, Whitney is a comedian, actor, writer, and producer. She is executive producer and along with Michael Patrick King, co-creator of the Emmy-nominated CBS comedy, 2 Broke Girls. She has headlined with comics including Sarah Silverman, Louis C.K., Amy Schumer, Aziz Ansari, and many others. Her first one-hour standup special, Whitney Cummings: Money Shot, premiered on Comedy Central in 2010 and was nominated for an American Comedy Award. Her second standup special, Whitney Cummings: I Love You, debuted on Comedy Central in 2014. And her latest special, Whitney Cummings: I\u2019m Your Girlfriend, premiered on HBO. She will also be publishing her first book later this fall titled \u2013 and I do like this \u2013 I\u2019m Fine\u2026 And Other Lies. In this episode, she answers a number of your most popular questions including how to overcome codependency, her updated thoughts on marriage, the art and luck of creating something funny, and she\u2019s very process driven. I enjoyed digging into creativity and art and in general just production with her of various types. The benefits of having dogs, or animals in general. How to maximize your creative energy.\u00a0\u00a0Tips for more effective writing, and much, much more. So, please enjoy this conversation with \u2013 or I should say rather monologue that answers your questions by Whitney Cummings. Whitney Cummings: There we go. Hi, everyone. I\u2019m Whitney Cummings. This is my solo podcast for Tim Ferriss. I am not going to say anything about myself. I\u2019m sure that Tim just gave me a very embarrassing intro that if I heard, I would be consumed with shame over. And I know that his listeners are very into using their time wisely, rightly so, and all about productivity. So, I\u2019m going to try to be as expeditious as possible here. I printed out your questions, so, you\u2019re going to hear some papers flapping. Please forgive me. I\u2019m not as polished and slick as Tim is. So, hopefully that\u2019s not too distracting. I know that when I hear bad sound quality I have a panic attack, so, don\u2019t be mad. I tried to pick the most kind of meaty questions. My biggest fear in life is to be redundant and boring on a podcast. So, I\u2019m going to try to be expeditious and not repeat myself. All right, let\u2019s dig in. Becca. Becca Catty \u2013 sorry if I mispronounce your guys\u2019 name \u2013 asks, like a few people on here: I\u2019d like to understand more about Whitney\u2019s revelations when it comes to codependency. Some of her admissions on the last podcast prompted big changes for me. I\u2019d like to find out more about her journey. Has she overcome codependency challenges? Will they always be there? Maybe some practical tips on identifying codependent patterns. I\u2019m not mocking you, Becca, I\u2019m just trying to get through your question quickly; it\u2019s a long one. So, codependence is such a huge sort of piece to break off, but let\u2019s just dig in. If you don\u2019t know what codependency is, it\u2019s not your fault. This, in colloquial terms, I think codependency is used, thrown around in a very casual way, kind of like words like genius and hilarious. I think we\u2019ve kind of forgot what it even means at this point. But the, for lack of a better word, clinical definition of codependence, or my working definition is basically the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others. A preoccupation with what other people think, how other people feel. A concern, a pathological concern, rather, for other people, their problems. Putting other people\u2019s needs before your own. I\u2019ve heard it referred to as being pathologically thoughtful. It\u2019s almost like nice gone wrong. You\u2019re so nice that you\u2019re mean essentially because when you are preoccupied with other people\u2019s issues and try to take care of their feelings and take care of them, rescue them, martyr yourself on them, you end up ultimately being resentful. We say codependence breeds resentment. Let me be more specific. Just real quick, I am in a 12-step program. I\u2019m in Al-Anon, and I\u2019m in CODA, which is a 12-step program for recovering codependents. So, it is no joke. It can be debilitating. People can have a couple of codependent traits, or all-consuming codependent neural brain wiring, which is sort of my deal. It is not something \u2013 there\u2019s no panacea. It\u2019s not something you can just fix with a pill or a shot. It\u2019s a sort of process of recovery. You never beat it, you just kind of can maintain it. Let me come back to that in a second, because this all sounds really vague, even to me. Codependence can be developed from a myriad of childhood circumstances, everything from growing up in an alcoholic home to being raised by a narcicisstic or being the youngest child of a lot of kids so you didn\u2019t get a lot of attention. Essentially, it\u2019s a survival mechanism developed in order to get attention and feel safe, or it\u2019s the only thing you know because you were \u2013 your childhood circumstances were conducive to you thinking this was the only way to survive. I was raised in an alcoholic home. I think it\u2019s important to note that in order for alcoholism to be present, alcohol does not have to be present. If you grew up in a home that was hectic, that was rushed, that was a lot of drama. If there was a person in the home that was an energy vacuum, this doesn\u2019t mean that they had to be done drugs or drinking whiskey at noon. Alcoholism is a very what we call cunning and baffling disease. You don\u2019t have to see booze out, you don\u2019t have to see drugs. You just know something is wrong or you\u2019re not getting the attention and care that you need as a child. Maybe you developed an adrenaline addiction as a kid. I believe that I had something called epigenetic imprinting, which I actually read about in a book called The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine. Not to self-promote too much, but I loved it so much I wrote a movie with a brilliant comedian named Neil Brennan and made the move this year. That\u2019s how profoundly it changed my life, because I believe that the more we know about our neural brain wiring, the more freedom we have and the more patience we have with ourselves. That\u2019s another story, we\u2019ll get to that. But I\u2019m trying to be concise about this. But if you grew up in a chaotic environment, inconsistent environment, were rewarded for one thing on Tuesday and punished for the same thing the next day, you know, children get confused by stuff like that. Any kind of mental disorders, distractions growing up. A divorce, a trauma. Or, you grew up in a relatively copacetic environment and still have a preoccupation with other people\u2019s needs because it gives you meaning. You know, codependence can manifest from anything from exhausting yourself worrying about other people, finding yourself in relationships or attracted to people who you can rescue or fix. I find myself \u2013 I think my codependent bottom was, you know, being in a relationship with somebody who I had to take care of, you know, financially, emotionally. Caused me a tremendous amount of stress. Oh, I didn\u2019t \u2013 jumping around. I didn\u2019t finish my thought on epigenetic imprinting. That\u2019s when in utero, a child becomes addicted to stress chemicals in the womb because the mother is stressed out. So, if you grew up around a tense marriage, tension in general, any kind of anxiety. Low-income homes are particularly susceptible to this, because of the constant financial stress. So, if your mother, in utero, in producing adrenaline, cortisol, norepinephrine, phenylethylamine, all these chemicals, the fetus then becomes addicted to it the same way a crack baby would \u2013 a lot of crack babies are born with an addiction to crack. Tragic, obviously. But I had a predisposition to be addicted to adrenaline. And I, as an adult, recreated my childhood circumstances by seeking out relationships that caused me stress and adrenaline. That\u2019s what was familiar to me. It felt safe. It\u2019s all I knew. You know, a lot of people I know who have a lot of anxiety in their life and stress and drama, you know, and me, before I was in recovery, we lament it and hate it, but yet we find ourselves over and over again subconsciously gravitating towards those kinds of relationships, jobs, circumstances. So, codependence more specifically can manifest in everything from going to dinners you don\u2019t want to go to, going to baby showers. You know, when someone asks me if they\u2019re codependent \u2013 and I\u2019m self-diagnosed, I can\u2019t tell you \u2013 I usually say, look at your calendar and look at your verbiage, the way that you talk. Do you say, \u201cI have to go to this thing next week. I have to go to this wedding. I have to pick my friend up from the airport.\u201d You don\u2019t have to do any of those things. Codependence tells us that we do, that we can\u2019t say no. Maybe we grew up in a situation where we had to do things that we didn\u2019t want to do, or had to walk on eggshells around other people\u2019s feelings. Our parents. Maybe our parents were fragile or very sensitive, and as a result, we think it\u2019s appropriate or necessary to constantly go through life doing things that we don\u2019t want to do. I also \u2013 if you have a hard time receiving, it\u2019s very easy for you to give but hard for you to receive. Used to receiving gifts or help made me really uncomfortable. My comfort zone was helping other people and focusing on their needs. I never admitted to having needs before I was in recovery for codependence. I couldn\u2019t ask for help. I couldn\u2019t say Uncle. There was no amount of work I wouldn\u2019t take on. I didn\u2019t know how to put my health first. I gave more than I had. I\u2019m feeling myself being very vague, which is also a codependent thought. We beat ourselves up. We obsess over what other people think about us. We worry that other people don\u2019t like us. And it\u2019s draining. You know? People always say, like, but I like that about myself. And don\u2019t you need that to be successful? And, what if I\u2019m just nice and I help other people and I go to baby showers even though I don\u2019t want to. Isn\u2019t that just being nice? Yes, there is, you know, the reason this is such a nefarious condition is because it\u2019s so socially acceptable, and you can kind of file it under being nice. Being in recovery for codependence doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be nice anymore and do nice things. You just, your mode has changed, because being nice for the wrong reasons actually isn\u2019t nice. It\u2019s selfish. If I\u2019m doing something nice for you because I want you to think I\u2019m nice, that\u2019s like borderline sociopathic, right? That\u2019s manipulative. That\u2019s not a pure intention. If I\u2019m doing something nice for you because I want to be of service with no strings attached, you know, that is admirable. So, you know, I hope that this is a sufficient answer. I don\u2019t want to spend the whole time talking about codependence. There\u2019s so much to cover in it. But I do think it might be pertinent to Tim\u2019s listeners, because codependents often have a paralyzing issue with perfectionism. I suffer from this, and it sounds like maybe being dramatic, but I really struggle with perfectionism. I can\u2019t turn things in on time, staying up until four in the morning, changing the font on a document. You know, I\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but before recording this podcast, I started it \u2013 I tried it four times, and I was like, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Whitney.\u201d That was stupid. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Whitney.\u201d That was even dumber. You\u2019re an idiot. You know? That\u2019s a waste of time. So, what I would say is that codependence, ultimately, it\u2019s stressful, it\u2019s exhausting, it ages you. It ultimately makes people resent you. It makes you resent people. It\u2019s dishonest. But it\u2019s also unproductive. So, I feel like it might be helpful to some listeners. If you find yourself wasting time going to events you don\u2019t want to go to, being friends with people that you don\u2019t like. I mean, before I was in recovery for codependence, I didn\u2019t think I had a choice in the kind of people I was friends with. Of course, Tim says you\u2019re the average of the four people you spend time with. And before program, I just was friends with anyone who asked because I didn\u2019t know I was allowed to say no to people. You know, and I took on work that I shouldn\u2019t, that was a waste of time, just because I was like, if I don\u2019t do this, then they\u2019re not going to hire me for this, and what if they don\u2019t like me, and what if they\u2019re mad at me? Like, this inner monologue is really a giant waste of time, and self-flagellating, ultimately. And you know, something we say in codependence recovery is that perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis. So, when we have perfectionism, we can\u2019t get work done. We can\u2019t be creative. We can\u2019t work from our energy source or from our heart because we\u2019re so stuck in a self-critical state of, that was stupid, that sucked, that wasn\u2019t good enough, no one\u2019s going to like this, you\u2019re going to fail. That inner monologue is \u2013 rewriting that inner monologue has been a big part of my codependent recovery. If you want to know more about codependence I would say read a book called Codependent No More by Melanie Beatty. I hope I\u2019m pronouncing her last name right. You might not relate to everything. You might just relate to some things. But I find that you know, this has been a huge part of me sort of breaking the cycle of codependence, which I think has been passed on from generation to generation in this country, because alcoholism has been passed on. Learning about alcoholism also has really helped me. Alcohol used to be in water before the 1900s as an antiseptic. People couldn\u2019t drink water without alcohol. I mean, alcohol is just such a big part of the fabric of this country, and I think we\u2019re sort of paying the emotional price now. We\u2019re kind of the first generation kind of trying to rectify the, you know, repercussions of this disease. And it sort of reaches far and wide. Let me move on, because I could talk about that forever. Tiffany Savin. Oh, she\u2019s asking about codependency as well. She\u2019s asking:  How you know if you\u2019re codependent? I feel like I sort of covered that. You know, something else I\u2019ll just say really quick is, codependents tend to not have fun and hobbies in their life. This is embarrassing to admit, but before I was in recovery for codependence, I didn\u2019t have fun. That sounds weird. Like, I would go to a party, and I would be like \u2013 I felt like I was performing fun or just trying to get it over with. I had a hard time being present because I was so in my head about having fun perfectly. And it\u2019s like having a \u2013 you know what? Codependency is like having a sports announcer constantly weighing in on your performance in life, you know? Whitney walked into the party. She said hi to that guy. That didn\u2019t go well. She just embarrassed herself. Why did she bring that up? That was weird. Now she has food in her teeth. Like, it\u2019s a constant sort of negative underpinning, and shaming. I mean, I used to have the inner monologue of, you should be home, you should be working, you\u2019re falling behind, and you should be working harder. You know, for codependents, it\u2019s never enough. For me, I think the last thing I\u2019ll say is, you know, especially for Tim\u2019s listeners, which I know you guys are all very sort of ambitious people with a lot of goals, it\u2019s finding that balance between overworking and codependently working. I think my codependence has been an engine for me to get a lot done, but it has backfired. There\u2019s a certain point where I have burnt out and wasted a lot of time worrying about what other people think or spending that extra hour making something perfect in my brain, which no one cares if it\u2019s double-spaced or single-spaced. I could have gotten an hour of sleep instead. Recovery from codependence helps me to prioritize my health so that I don\u2019t burn out. Before recovery and being in a 12-step program, I worked so hard that I got pneumonia. So, you know, it\u2019s I guess diminishing marginal returns. Would that be the concept? I don\u2019t know where I got that from. But there\u2019s a certain point where you work so hard that you actually become unproductive or you make yourself sick or you\u2019re tired or your friendships suffer or your hobbies suffer, or, you know, you need a personal life in order to be, I think, a good artist, or a good businessperson. I believe in order for art to imitate life, you have to have a life. And if you\u2019re a businessperson, you have to know what people want. If you\u2019re selling a product to people, you have to know people. So, that\u2019s all I will say, because I\u2019m very concerned that I\u2019m being a broken record. Francisco Israel asks: I would like to see a deconstruction of what makes stuff funny. What is the fabric of humor? Like a quick, to be funny, manual. Cheers, from Chile.  I hope I pronounced that right. Chile. Sorry, I was really trying to sound sexy, and it didn\u2019t go well. Francisco, I have been doing standup, I would say about 12 years. I still can\u2019t tell you the Y = mx + b of why something is funny, which I think is why I love doing this so much. It\u2019s mysterious, it\u2019s elusive. Different things are funny on different people. I could do George Carlin\u2019s act and bomb, you know? Louis C.K. could do my act \u2013 well, I mean, he\u2019s a guy, so, that would sound very weird. That might actually be funnier than the way I do it. But if that makes any sense. What makes somebody funny is, I think, a combination of the truth, high-stakes, and their essence. You know, Sebastian Maniscalco, I know I brought him up on the last broadcast, but he\u2019s fascinating to me because if you were to transcribe his act, for the most part, there\u2019s not a lot of jokes in it if you were to look at a piece of paper. It\u2019s in his performance and it\u2019s in his eyes, it\u2019s in his timing. It\u2019s kind of intangible. I know Sebastian\u2019s a friend of mine, and you know, as a person, he\u2019s funny as well, but something happens when he goes on stage that it\u2019s an intersection between him and the audience, so, the energy of the audience plays a really big role, which is, you know, changes every night. The audience is different every night, which means why something\u2019s funny is different every night. It\u2019s fascinating to me. You know, I think that I do know that if you want to do comedy or be a writer, you know, even if you want to be a businessperson, I think this probably matters. I think Apple does a good job with this and understands the role of surprise. Surprise is, I think, one some level the most important part of comedy, at least the kind that I do. If you surprise someone, they will usually laugh, either it\u2019s a negative surprise or a positive surprise. You\u2019ve seen people watch horror movies. You\u2019ve seen a surprise party. Surprise is important, and it\u2019s really hard to surprise people these days. It seems like everybody\u2019s become so desensitized. So, if you can do that, I think you\u2019re going to get everything you want in life. You know, and there\u2019s also some funny stuff that I can\u2019t explain. I remember specifically like, maybe like, eight years ago, there was this comedian. His name was Fadem. Really funny guy. Sort of alternative comedian. And he was on stage at the Improv, and I remember I was waiting to go up, and I was just a young, you know, kid. I had no idea what I was doing. Waiting to go on. And he \u2013 he\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s almost like performance art what he does, and he does sort of an impression, like a post-modern impression of a comedian, and lot of levels to what he does. But he started running in place like, in a really dramatic way. Like, flailing and gesticulating, like, out of breath. Like, [panting]. You can\u2019t see me, so, it\u2019s ridiculous that I\u2019m trying to \u2013 that I\u2019m actually doing this alone in my house. But he started running in place, and it was really funny at the beginning, because he was like, exhausting himself, and everyone\u2019s kind of laughing. And then like, 30 seconds past, and I remember being like, okay. What\u2019s next? Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s move. Like, you\u2019re milking this, Josh. And then a minute past, and he\u2019s running. And no one\u2019s laughing at this point. People are just like, what is he doing? This person\u2019s having like, a manic break. He commits to it so hard he goes for like, another 30 seconds. And I remember at this point just being like, angry. Like, what is he doing up there? Like, this is crazy. He\u2019s taking stage time from other comedians. Like, a lot of Tim Ferriss listeners, I\u2019m very obsessed with using my time wisely, and I\u2019m like, this guy is wasting valuable stage time. Two minutes. About 30 seconds later, he\u2019s still running in place. The audience starts laughing again. Fifteen, 20 seconds later, we\u2019re laughing so hard I\u2019m crying. I\u2019m crying laughing. Deepest depths of my gut. My muscles are killing me. I had to leave the room I was laughing so hard. I don\u2019t know what he did. It was some magical bell curve of funny where he committed so hard to something that we all just \u2013 I still can\u2019t explain it. I can\u2019t explain it. And it was one of the funniest things I had ever seen. You know, he kind of got past the stage of bombing and turned it into this other level of \u2013 I can\u2019t even explain it. Performance art. But it was surprising. You know? The audacity that he had and the bravery. And it was just \u2013 it was really amazing to see. And I remember going like, oh, I\u2019ll never understand how comedy works, because this is amazing. And let\u2019s see, I think things are also funny at different times all the time. That\u2019s something else that\u2019s kind of amazing about comedy, is something that was funny a month ago might not be funny in two months, you know? Trump jokes were really funny six months ago. Not so funny anymore, you know? It got real. You know? So, that\u2019s something else that is \u2013 you know, you listen to old comedy, and some stuff holds up, but other stuff you\u2019re like, that was funny 20 years ago? And people are dying in the audience, just crying, you know? I think it\u2019s definitely harder to be dirty funny, is that makes any sense, because, you know, everybody has seen ite all these days in the age of porn. How do you say anything dirty anymore? I think what\u2019s becoming shocking changes, you know? I think when I started doing standup, you know, this is going to sound gross, but it was a lot of like, AIDS jokes. That was like, the edgiest thing you could say. Now that\u2019s not funny, to me at least, personally. Racial jokes are less funny now that, you know, Black Lives Matter, and it\u2019s, you know, ubiquitous on the news, sort of all the racial injustices. Race jokes aren\u2019t that funny to me. When a white person does a race joke, not as funny. When a black person does it, you\u2019re like, oh, I have permission \u2013 you know, something different happens. You know, so, it\u2019s such a case-by-case basis. So, I guess what I would say is that if you\u2019re trying to be a comedian, don\u2019t worry about what other people are doing. Do your thing. Whatever your essence is, whatever your truth is, I promise you, you are funny in a specific, original way. Talk about your most embarrassing thoughts and your personal experience, because you know, you\u2019re not going to be funny doing Daniel Tosh\u2019s act. That\u2019s \u2013 Daniel Tosh is funny because of his cellular makeup and his DNA. So, I would say just stay specific, and be yourself. That\u2019s such weird clich\u00e9 advice, but I guess there\u2019s a reason people say it so much. Okay, next question. I don\u2019t know who asked this. I deleted his name. Sorry. Not codependent anymore. I don\u2019t even care what your name is, sir. Just kidding. I\u2019m really sorry. Please don\u2019t be mad. Has Whitney\u2019s view on relationships changed since the Howard Stern interview back in January? What is her take on marriage?  Well, anonymous man \u2013 I assume it\u2019s a man for some reason. I, first of all, do not remember what my take was on Howard Stern, because when I go on his show, I completely black out and have an out-of-body experience and look down at my shell of a body from above just yelling, please stop saying what you\u2019re saying, because I\u2019m just embarrassing myself at six in the morning, mind you. So, I\u2019m usually half asleep and in a melatonin hangover. So, I presume I was relatively negative about it. I think publicly I have been somewhat cynical about marriage. A few of you might know this, but I saw three divorces by the time I was 15. Very acrimonious, expensive, court-casey marriages. So, I think it was inculcated in my brain that marriage just was a giant waste of time and immense source of anxiety and stress. I now have a little more mature take on it. I think on some level I wanted to make sure that my beliefs about marriage were at least my own and not a result or core beliefs because of the blueprint I saw growing up. I, you know, don\u2019t want to be a puppet of the mistakes that my family made. And if I don\u2019t believe in marriage, I at least want it to be for original reasons. So, I definitely had a lot of fear around it until recently. I would say that my opinion has changed on marriage, and the reason that I included this question is because my reasons for thinking that I think might appeal to Tim Ferriss\u2019 listeners, because I have a little bit of a casual theory going about how the most successful people and the people whose careers I admire are happily married people. I think it probably is no surprise to anyone that being single is very time consuming, exhausting, and distracting. It\u2019s a full-time job, especially if you\u2019re online dating like I am. And I see a lot of value in finding somebody who can be a teammate, and if the person supports your goals, I think it\u2019s a risk that is worth taking, even if it doesn\u2019t pan out. I believe in marriage. I also believe strongly in divorce if something isn\u2019t working. I think the stigma on divorce is obsolete and frankly kind of ridiculous given our recent scientific discoveries about neurology. Yo know, marriage was invented when the life expectancy was 30 years old. We\u2019re now living to 80. It\u2019s an unrealistic and unfair pressure and expectation to put on people that a marriage should last forever. If it does, that\u2019s awesome. Congratulations. You\u2019re an anomaly. But if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay. I hope to have a couple marriages in my lifetime. I just recently kind of learned the value of teamwork in a relationship and being in a relationship, this is new to me, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve actually ever been in one of these yet, but it is my goal to be in a relationship that energizes you instead of depletes you. I have historically been in depleting relationships, and an energizing relationship with somebody who kind of takes you off the market and out of the incredibly distracting single scene I think is really conducive to productivity and achieving your goals. I think it\u2019s tricky, because the kind of people I think who listen to this podcast and who want to win in life and accomplish all their goals are highly motivated and always looking for an upgrade and to achieve highly in their professional lives. But, I think the people who are really successful and get to the most admirable echelon in their field have very high standards \u2013 standards probably isn\u2019t the word. Very ambitious professional goals, but in their personal life are not always looking for the upgrade, or looking to achieve highly. Not that marrying someone that, you know, I\u2019m not judging this abstract metaphor, but, you know, I think it\u2019s part human nature and part a type-A personality to always be looking for something better, improving yourself. I have suffered from debilitating perfectionism. Every time I\u2019m in a relationship, I\u2019m like, should I be with someone smarter, you know, funnier, this, that. And it\u2019s exhausting. And I think that a healthy level of acceptance of this person is awesome, I should commit to them, and yes, I could, I\u2019m sure, scour the world for the upgrade, but that\u2019s all relative, and that\u2019s all energy better used to, I think, upgrade yourself, and whatever you\u2019re doing in your work. So, I\u2019m personally striving to \u2013 the word\u2019s not complacent, but or to settle, but I am personally looking in my personal life to find someone who doesn\u2019t make my life harder, and if I, you know, marriage made sense, I would totally do it if I planned on being with that person. My expectations, however, I think, have become more realistic. I don\u2019t expect my personal life to be 50 Shades of Grey every day. That\u2019s a form of perfectionism in relationships, to have the best marriage with the most interesting person with the most successful person. I mean, that\u2019s all \u2013 those are standards that I would like to reserve for my professional life and maybe in my parenting in the future instead of in my partner-seeking, because if someone were to judge me based on the way I judge others, I would never measure up. So, I\u2019m trying to just kind of have not low expectations, but realistic expectations given what I know about neurology and monogamy and the history of marriage and what it was intended for. I think I have a much more mature take. I recently looked into selling my house, and learned that if you\u2019re married, you get to keep a lot more of the money. So, that\u2019s a very mercenary take, but if I\u2019m with somebody, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 it makes no sense to be with someone for ten years and not marry them just for a stubborn, you know, fake qualm with the institution of marriage. You know, I no longer think it\u2019s cool or hip to be negative about marriage. But I do have realistic expectations. I think I said before, I believe in divorce. I believe strongly in prenups. I don\u2019t think that means you anticipate it ending. I think it\u2019s just a really smart safety net. I think they\u2019re on LegalZoom. You don\u2019t have to have money to have a prenup. It just makes things \u2013 I just think it\u2019s a smart decision. I would do that even if you never use it. When you ask for a prenup or have that discussion you find out who the other person is, so, you can also use talking about a prenup to find out what kind of person the other person you might be marring is. And I also would never marry someone that I don\u2019t think would handle a divorce with grace and class. I think to expect a relationship to last forever I think is slightly unfair because hopefully I want to be the kind of person who\u2019s growing so much and changing and learning and evolving so much that there\u2019s a strong chance that whoever I marry in two years, I won\u2019t get along with in ten, because I\u2019ve grown so much, or, I\u2019ve outgrown them. That could happen. Or, they could outgrow me. Who knows? Hopefully I marry the kind of person who would outgrow me, someone who is better than I am. So, anyway, I feel like I might be rambling. But I do think that \u2013 I hope this doesn\u2019t come off too psychopathic \u2013 that being in a good marriage can be very productive and conducive to professional success because stability, finding stability in other parts of my life is energizing and calming, and the last thing you need if you\u2019re trying to take over the world or start a business or write a book or start an app is to be having petty arguments with an immature person all day. You know, it would be ridiculous that we spend all this time on life hacks and conserving our energy and four-hour body and four-hour week and then being in a 400-hour relationship, right? So, I think Tim needs to write the four-hour relationship. That would be \u2013 the four-hour marriage? That would be amazing. Only have to see the person four hours a week? Please, someone, patent that. And yeah, so, all right. Let\u2019s move on to the next question, because I fear I\u2019m already revealing too much about my damaged psyche. Let\u2019s move on, because I\u2019m feeling like this answer is going to make me be single forever. Tom Vemont \u2013 I hope I\u2019m pronouncing that right: She has multiple dogs in her house. Do they ever fight, and if so, how does she handle it?  Dog people. I know that Tim just got a dog, so, maybe you guys are all dog training information-ed out. But if you have dogs, I highly recommend them. They\u2019re very therapeutic. They\u2019re energizing. They have taught me a tremendous amount about discipline, helped with my codependent recovery, because you can\u2019t be codependent and train a dog, especially not a really big, strong dog. I have pit bulls that are just kind of walking lawsuits because everyone is just so litigious these days, and you have to have incredibly well-trained dogs if they\u2019re stronger than you, which mine are. Discipline training with a dog is, I think, great practice for being a boss, for running a company, for being an artist, for being in a healthy relationship, healthy marriage, if you will, if I didn\u2019t just completely talk you out of getting married. Introducing dogs. A couple of things. Know the dog. If it\u2019s a rescue, which I highly encourage, know the dog\u2019s triggers. Spend some time with the dog alone first. Don\u2019t introduce them right away. If you have a dog that already lives in your home, do not just bring the new dog in. Dogs are incredibly territorial, especially if it\u2019s a female. I would also say make sure you spay and neuter your dogs, always. Makes them more confrontational and aggressive if a dog is not neutered. It makes the dog \u2013 puts the dog in danger, because it makes other dogs threatened by them. Spay and neuter your dogs. Please. That is going to greatly reduce the chances that they\u2019re going to get in an altercation or get attacked or attack. First things first, take all \u2013 if you\u2019re going to bring a new dog in the house, take all the food off the floor, any toys, anything your dog might be possessive over. Make sure you crate-train your dogs. Always put them in crates next to each other first. Only feed them in crates next to each other at first. The new dog, make sure you always give less attention than the dog you\u2019ve had longer. You know, when you come in, pet the new dog first, the other dog second. Treat the new dog like a red-headed stepchild, basically. Make sure you are the alpha of the house. Your dogs are not going to fight with each other if you\u2019re the alpha and if they respect you. I\u2019m going to try to make this shorter, because I could talk about this forever. Yeah, I would say just be the alpha. If any dogs show aggression, I instantly put them down on the ground and hold them by their front and back legs, hold them down until they exhale and have acquiesced to you being dominant. If you know your dog well, I would, you know, I bite them on the back of the neck and emulate being the alpha dog. It\u2019s very weird to watch and not sexy. I try to only do it in private. Those things work for me. I have submissive dogs. I\u2019ve had them since puppies. I have been in experiences with dogs that are not submissive who I have not had since they were puppies. That is much harder. And I recommend that you get a professional trainer if it\u2019s a big dog. Dogs are animals. We can\u2019t forget that. They have evolved to read our faces and to be domesticated and to serve us, but they also want to protect us, and that can be confusing to dogs and can often cause fights. So, if your dog is fighting, probably is just trying to protect you or thinks you want it to. But the key is to just be the alpha and to make sure that your dog has really strong recall. If your dog does fight with another dog, if it doesn\u2019t respect you, it\u2019s not going to stop. And if you\u2019re just yelling and screaming, it\u2019s going to think that you\u2019re participating in the fight and encouraging it. It doesn\u2019t know. So, look at yourself. There\u2019s a great documentary called Buck that I highly recommend, about the horse whisperer guy, and he talks about training horses. Or, it\u2019s a documentary on him training horses. And essentially it\u2019s about, you know, your dog is a reflection of you. Whatever is going on with you is what\u2019s going on with your dog. So, whenever you\u2019re training \u2013 you know, I have this amazing trainer who came in when I was training my first dog, Ramona, and she was a tricky dog. She had some brain damage as a baby, abused pit bull puppy. I was really scared. I didn\u2019t know that much about pit bulls, and she was going to get really big, and there\u2019s so much propaganda and myths about pit bulls. But, they do have, you know, a row of great white shark teeth, and they can hurt you even by accident if you\u2019re stupid. So, you know, my trainer comes in. Her name is Julie Illes if you are in the California area. She\u2019s great. Does impulse control. You send your dog for like, three weeks, and but she comes in, and I was like, hi, nice to meet you. Do you want to go outside and meet Ramona? And she was like, I\u2019m not here to meet Ramona, I\u2019m here to meet you. I was like, what? I mean, the first training session she was training me, because any problems that you have psychologically your dog is going to have. If you\u2019re impatient, your dog\u2019s going to be impatient. If you have anger issues, your dog is going to have anger issues. If you have anxiety, your dog is going to have anxiety. They\u2019re very empathic. And they mirror their owners. So, if you\u2019ve got an issue with your dog, you might want to look in the mirror. I\u2019ve had to do that many times. It\u2019s painful, it\u2019s frustrating. But training my dogs has been one of the most growth-inducing edification experiences of my life because if you\u2019re a dangerous person, you\u2019re going to have a dangerous dog. And it\u2019s really powerful. Really poignant. And really frustrating. And lots of crying and lots of anger. But it really made me realize how outrageously inappropriate my expectations were for other people as well as dogs. You get a dog and you\u2019re like, why aren\u2019t you doing what I want you to do? Why would they? You haven\u2019t told them. You know, it teaches \u2013 taught me how to set boundaries, how to have realistic expectations, to ask for what I need, to enforce my boundaries, to be consistent. You can\u2019t be inconsistent with a dog. If you say no to going on the couch five times but you let them go on the sixth time, dogs are gamblers. They\u2019re always going to try to play for that one time that they won. So, you have to be consistent, which is a skill. You can\u2019t be lazy. You can\u2019t cut corners. So, you know, training dogs, I think, is a metaphor for life and for work, relationships, all of it. It\u2019s powerful. Cats I don\u2019t know as much about. If you\u2019re a cat person, I\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t have more to say about them, but they scare me and make me feel insecure. Also, this is probably going to be polarizing. Purebred dogs, I think that there\u2019s too much breeding and inbreeding. I have more luck with mutts. In my experience, they tend to be a little bit healthier. This is a total judgement and not a real statistic. This is just what I\u2019ve seen. Is that this pure-breeding dogs, they tend to be a little more intractable. I\u2019ve seen some things go wrong, I guess is what I will say. So, my other little piece of propaganda, I think you guys probably know by this point, that I\u2019m super into dog rescue and adoption. So, if you don\u2019t have a dog, my recommendation is adopt them. I find that mixed dogs \u2013 I\u2019ve had a little more luck with them. Okay, Dave Ware asks: Ways to maintain creative energy during overwhelming workload.  Great question. You know, I am a sort of type-A workaholic, and until very recently, I did not know how to maintain my creative energy. I was, you know, like the horse boxer from Animal Farm. I just thought, keep working and keep working and white-knuckle through it. And I don\u2019t live that way anymore. If you\u2019re having writer\u2019s block, business development block, whatever you do, I would say you have to chase inspiration like a rabid hunter. You have to be constitutionally dedicated to protecting your energy, your brain, and your inner child. Inner child. Sounds weird, I know. If you do relate to codependency at all, or think you grew up in some kind of dysfunctional home, The Big Book of Adult Children of Alcoholics, there is \u2013 I don\u2019t know the page number, but there is a description of inner child work, which is all about nurturing your inner child. I do believe that we\u2019re all just five-year-olds who happen to be very tall and have nice clothes and cars. But I believe that we\u2019re all essentially five years old, and we forget that sometimes. And I feel like I\u2019ve spent, you know, a lot of money and time trying to get back to my five-year-old self who was focused on play and creativity and the sky was the limit and colored outside the box, you know? I\u2019m not slamming our education system, but I think we go through this conforming process in school where we\u2019re taught what to think, not how to think. And then we get out of college, and we made all the grades and developed discipline and maybe developed an Adderall addiction, but we\u2019re robots. And then all of a sudden, the most successful people are always the most creative ones, not the robot zombies who, you know, punch numbers. So, I think it\u2019s really important to nurture that inner child part of yourself. I\u2019ll get more specific. When I feel blocked when I\u2019m writing, I watch cartoons. I\u2019m not even kidding. I watched, recently, the old Bambi with that beautiful animation that looks like paintings. I couldn\u2019t watch the part where the mom died, because it makes me cry. I do use adult coloring books. I think those are kind of in-vogue at the moment. I have one over there. I don\u2019t know the name of it, but you can get them on Amazon. There\u2019s one that\u2019s like, serenity, meditation, there\u2019s one that\u2019s kind of funny. It\u2019s like, inappropriate and dirty. I try to color things opposite of what they should be. I try to color, but not perfectly, because as you know, I have perfection issues. So, I got this one that was like, New York icons, and there was a cab. Instead of coloring the taxicab yellow and the sky blue, I made the cab blue and the sky yellow, trying to work the part of my brain of thinking outside the box. And that\u2019s a muscle to me. And that\u2019s something that I can use when I\u2019m working so that I\u2019m not doing the same thing over and over again. I don\u2019t want to become a bad \u2013 do a bad impression of myself. I don\u2019t want to repeat myself. I watch people that inspire me. Marina Abramovi\u0107, I\u2019m a fan. I watched her documentary. Whenever I\u2019m blocked, I\u2019ll watch her videos. I just read her autobiography. She inspired me. She\u2019s fearless, and it\u2019s just a brave \u2013 it\u2019s humbling. She\u2019s a performance artist, if you don\u2019t know. Marina Abramovi\u0107. A-b-r-a-m-o-v-i-\u0107. It\u2019s kind of my dream for her to be on the Tim Ferriss show. I\u2019ll just let you look her up. I don\u2019t think I can describe her. She\u2019s a really powerful incisive performance artist who involves the audience as sort of part of the show. And, you know, I was reading about how she lived with the aborigines in Australia for six months and was eating bugs, and I\u2019m complaining because I can\u2019t finish the last chapter of my book because I\u2019m tired. You know? It helps me to have perspective and gratitude, and reminds me what it takes to be great. I think that\u2019s important. Gratitude. I watch things that I\u2019m a fan of. The Black Mirror, the English version, is, I believe, I mean, one of the most inspiring things I\u2019ve ever seen. And so, I\u2019ll go back and watch it. It inspires me. I go back and watch a movie I\u2019ve already seen that\u2019s brilliant to look for moments and details. The Shining is, I think, unbelievable. Every time I watch it I see something new, and I\u2019m like, you know, it reminds me that the best artists, the best businessmen are \u2013 people, not men \u2013 all of them are relentlessly dedicated to detail, tireless, all the things that I need to find within myself to push myself over the finish line of whatever I\u2019m doing. I meditate. I know Tim talks about this a lot. I was doing transcendental meditation for a while. You know, I feel like I plateaued. I started kind of just falling asleep when I did it. I now have a teacher named George Haas at a place called Against the Stream in Los Angeles. He teaches an online class, it\u2019s called the Meaningful Life. It\u2019s like a ten-month course that I think you can take from anywhere. He puts the videos on Vimeo and posts the readings and stuff on Dropbox, and it\u2019s very specific to target, you know, forgiveness meditations, meta-compassion meditations. That\u2019s really worked for me. I think I need specific things to work on, and he helps you identify your attachment strategy based on what happened to you in the first three years of your life based on John Bowlby\u2019s theory of attachment. Very interesting stuff. That\u2019s really helped me. Again, I\u2019m a science dork. I watch TED Talks. That\u2019s kind of unoriginal, but I just will watch it about something I know nothing about to sort of awaken a part of my brain that\u2019s asleep. I recently watched one on a girl who animates light for Pixar. I know nothing about animation, and it \u2013 you know, when I watch a TED Talk or read a book about something of which I know nothing, it gives me that childlike feeling of learning something new, and that energizes me in my creativity. I believe very strongly in brain rest. I know we all want to work, you know, 18-hour days, Saturday, Sundays. It\u2019s really important to take time off and play. This isn\u2019t my advice or my idea. You know, studies, statistic, science supports that our brains do need to rest, you know, in order to be productive. You guys have probably all read the four-hour work week. I don\u2019t need to tell you to take time off. I believe very strongly in rituals. Michael Patrick King, who made Sex & The City, The Comeback, which I think is one of the top three greatest comedy shows of all time with Lisa Kudrow on HBO. Brilliant, brilliant stuff. I go back and watch that sometimes when I\u2019m feeling like I need some inspiration. He told me I need to have a ritual. Always have a ritual. I often work from home, which is hard, because I\u2019m distracted and it\u2019s easy to procrastinate, and, oh, I need to clean that, and oh, I should go make another sandwich. Rituals are important. So, now \u2013 this is going to be embarrassing \u2013 but if I\u2019m working from home, I don\u2019t get to wake up and just be in pajamas and go online and you work in pajamas. I wake up, I brush my teeth, I put on a bra \u2013 it\u2019s important to wear a bra. Keeps you awake. If you\u2019re a woman, that underwire gives you that extra kick. You have to have good posture when you\u2019re being impaled by a rusty wire. I put shoes on. I wash my face. I put makeup on as if I\u2019m going to the office. If you work from home, it\u2019s really important not to be a slob. I light a candle. I have flowers in my house. It\u2019s really important I have fresh flowers. There\u2019s just something about it that is a Pavlovian reaction. I\u2019m serious. This is happening. I have sage. Michael gave it to me. I sage in the morning. I do around the whole house. I do a little meditation. I kind of ask for what I want. You know, please give me the creative energy to get through this day. Help me to be truthful. Like, whatever. I set an intention for the day, whether it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m writing a book at the moment, which I\u2019ve never written a book before, and it\u2019s a totally new challenge for me. And you know, my intention yesterday was, help me to be honest today. Help me to tell the truth, relentlessly tell the truth today and not hide behind jokes and inauthenticity and be funny and cute in this chapter. Just help me to channel the truth instead of trying to impress critics that don\u2019t even have the book yet, you know? So, setting a really specific intention for what you want to accomplish for the day. I\u2019ll move on to something else, because that\u2019s embarrassing to admit. This sounds silly perhaps to some people. I\u2019ve been reading a lot about color therapy recently, and we all have different reactions to color. But I went to a place called Miraval in Arizona with my friend Neil Brennan, who I\u2019ve brought up already, and I went to a color therapist, and he helps you kind of find out what are your power colors. You don\u2019t have to have money to do this. You can figure it out yourself based on what you gravitate towards. And red for most people, and me, I\u2019m not exception \u2013 red was very energizing for me. So, in my office, I try to have red things. I have a red candle, I sort of have this beautiful vintage book, it\u2019s The Scarlet Letter, which was one of my favorite old books. I have it on my desk. It just gives me strength. Whether it\u2019s psychosomatic or not, the placebo effect is an effect, so, I will take it. Green is kind of a more soothing color for me. If I want to meditate, I go in my room. Everything is white or moss green. It might just be a fake, crazy Hollywood religion thing, but it works for me. Find out what colors activate you, trigger you, and soothe you. Wear them to the meeting you\u2019re going to. Put them on. If I want to sort of create a new concept I\u2019ll only wear white, because that sort of feels like symbolically a fresh start for me. I\u2019m sure this sounds very crazy to you guys, but if it works, it works, right? Playing with dogs helps me to reenergize and to entertain and awaken the inner child, which I think is important to make sure that your inner child is honored in order to come up with new ideas and creative ideas. I don\u2019t know why I pronounced creative that way. I\u2019m obviously getting tired. Okay. That feels like enough. Chris Brown \u2013 I don\u2019t think the singer \u2013 texted: How does it feel to be in an industry dominated by men?  I don\u2019t know. Chris, you seem really nice, but I feel like I\u2019ve answered the question for ten years, and I still don\u2019t have a good answer. I guess what I would say is, I don\u2019t think about it. I see a lot of really powerful, awesome, strong women in this business. I love men, too, so, all the men I work with are awesome for the most part. But I do think that, you know, know yourself. If men are triggering to you because you grew up in a home where, you know, you\u2019ve got dad issues, figure it out. It used to be more triggering to me. I guess the most interesting way I can answer this question is, it used to bother me more before I got into therapy and got my shit together. Any issues I had with my dad that made men triggering I healed. I\u2019m still in the process of healing. I\u2019m sure there are a lot of wounds I haven\u2019t even gotten to yet that have yet to present themselves to me. But I would say, you know, I would actual argue that women are even more triggering to me. I actually had more complicated relationships with women growing up, which is where my codependence gestated. So, I actually had a harder time working with women in the beginning. I had trouble with authority figures. Women triggered a me feeling like, you know, without getting too specific about my family of origin, you know, my mother, I felt like I had to walk on eggshells around my mom. She was a very sensitive person. And she worked really hard. She had a day job, which I really respect and admire about her. She is a really big part of my work ethic. But she was working a full-time job, raising two kids in an acrimonious marriage, going through a divorce later, balancing a codependent overwhelming social life, and being a mom and cooking and cleaning and all of it. And she had a lot on her plate. And as a result, I found that it was hard for me to get attention. I didn\u2019t want to add stress to her life. I didn\u2019t want to make things more difficult to her, for her. And so, I minimized my own needs. I walked on eggshells. I tried to anticipate her needs, solve her problems, and I became very obsessed with making sure she was okay. So, that\u2019s where a lot of my codependence comes from and my preoccupation with other people\u2019s needs. I project that, or projected that onto people as adults. But I found that I did it more with women than with men. But in a professional environment, if I had a female boss or employee, I tend to recreate those circumstances and was very worried that all women were fragile and you had to take care of them, and that they could \u2013 they were going to cry at any second. And that I couldn\u2019t tell them no. I couldn\u2019t fire them. I couldn\u2019t give them notes on a script, they would just fall apart the way I saw as a kid. So, I guess my answer to this question is figure out your triggers. If working for a man is hard for you, figure out why. You know, your boss is not your dad, and your boss is not your mom. Your boyfriend is not your dad. Your husband is not your mom. You know, figure out what you\u2019re projecting onto people that\u2019s getting in your way. Figure out what old baggage you\u2019re bringing into a current situation, because a lot of times we have \u2013 we don\u2019t have a right-sized reaction to a situation. If something hurts your feelings too much in a workplace environment, it\u2019s probably not about your workplace environment. There\u2019s something else going on that you need to fix that has nothing to do with work. And that\u2019s draining, and it\u2019s old, old stuff that you need to heal. I\u2019m really trying not to curse. It\u2019s very hard for me. Anyway, I also \u2013 you know, this is going to sound, if you don\u2019t live in L.A. or New York, probably annoying. But like, I\u2019m kind of at the point where gender is not \u2013 you know, I don\u2019t really think about it. I know a lot of men with a lot of traditionally stereotypically female qualities, which is awesome, and I know a lot of women with a lot of traditionally stereotypical masculine qualities. You know, a lot of people think I have a lot of masculine qualities, at least in my work environment. Certainly not in my personal life.. But yeah, so, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t say, like, I need to hire a man for this job, or, I need to hire a woman for this job. You know, I know a lot of guys that are artists that are incredibly sensitive, and I know a lot of women who are, you know, business \u2013 in business. That\u2019s such a vague, weird, \u201880s way to describe it \u2013 who are really calculated and unemotional in all the things that you would maybe think of a man as having. So, we live in a cool time, don\u2019t we? Next question. Chip Franks. What a name. Feels like the male stripped from the \u201970s in Houston. Chip Franks asks: If you had to start all over again, no fans, few resources other than your amazing mind \u2013 thanks, Chip \u2013 what exactly would you do? What\u2019s the process, assuming you\u2019d even want to get back to where you are now? Ooh, that was ominous. I don\u2019t know how useful this question is to you guys. I guess I would say, you know, for anyone who wants to be in entertainment, I mean, the internet is totally different now. You know, this makes me feel very old, but when I started, you know, YouTube, people weren\u2019t getting famous off of YouTube. I guess if I were to start now, I\u2019d want to do it the right way. I\u2019d want to get good. I\u2019m glad that I started right before people were getting famous off YouTube, because I had to work for it. I went on the road and I got good. I got really good advice from Gary Shandling once, the late Gary Shandling who I am a huge fan of. One of my other favorite shows besides The Comeback is The Larry Sanders Show. Brilliant. Not sandals. Not Larry Sandals. Little plug for Sandals Resort. The Larry Sanders Show. Am I losing my mind? Gary Shandling and The Larry Sanders Show. Tweet it, blog it, Google it. He said to me once, \u201cIt can never happen too late,\u201d which was profound for me, because I think I thought \u2013 and I don\u2019t know where I got this; maybe it\u2019s my codependence, maybe it\u2019s my perfectionism, maybe it\u2019s specifically American capitalism, maybe it\u2019s my type-A ambition, I don\u2019t know \u2013 but I thought that I had to get success fast. It was all about being as quick as possible. And so, if I were to do it over again, I would have done it slower. I think that I got things a little too fast for a myriad of reasons. One was me wanting it fast. You know, I did need money. I was broke. So, I did need to get income quickly. But in terms of getting exposure quickly, standup quicker is very rarely better. You know, it\u2019s like being a bodybuilder, an athlete. You know, that\u2019s probably a bad example, because most athletes are very young. But, you know, you have to get good first. If you get exposure before you\u2019re good, it only hurts you, especially with the internet now, because you can\u2019t have a bad set and have it disappear. It\u2019s online forever and will haunt you. So, I guess what I would say is faster is not necessarily better. That\u2019s all I will say on that. In terms of having, you know, staff and hiring people, I would have asked for help. You know, I think I made a lot of mistakes pretending I knew more than I did, which was part of my codependence. I thought that asking for help would make me seem weak. I pretended to know answers to questions that I didn\u2019t know, which is interesting, because now I always think the smartest people are the ones that ask the most questions. I\u2019m always so impressed when someone\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Can you explain that better?\u201d I never \u2013 I\u2019m never like, \u201cThat moron.\u201d I\u2019m always like, \u201cGood for him.\u201d It\u2019s impressive to me when someone asks for help or admits that they don\u2019t know something. I think that\u2019s a really admirable quality. I wish I had known that sooner. I would have asked for more help. I would have fired people sooner. If you guys have employees, it\u2019s like a relationship. If you have doubts, just get out. That\u2019s my philosophy. I mean, not once you\u2019re married. I mean, you can\u2019t just leave whenever you want. There\u2019s also something to be said for fighting and having perspective and figuring out what\u2019s going on with you first. That\u2019s another story. But, I did not trust my gut with people in terms of firing them. I wish I would have saved a lot of time and energy. I think I would have made better work. You know, I did a TV show on NBC, and I think I made a mistake of not firing people sooner, because I didn\u2019t want people to be mad at me. I wanted to give people chances. My codependence was before recovery. I didn\u2019t want to hurt people\u2019s feelings. A lot of that stuff got in the way of the work being good. I regret that. I would not have wasted time in my personal life on people that I should not have been dating. You know, I was really preoccupied in \u2013 I wasted a lot of time, let\u2019s just say, in bad relationships, because I hadn\u2019t gotten my shit together, basically. So, I would have gone to therapy sooner. Go to therapy. I mean, there\u2019s ways \u2013 you know, 12-step meetings are free. It\u2019s free medicine. These days, there\u2019s no excuse. You can go online, there are therapists that give talks on YouTube. Tons of great ones. There are incredible books out there. If you can\u2019t afford to go to therapy, if your insurance doesn\u2019t cover it, there\u2019s group therapy that\u2019s cheaper. Anything you can get to know yourself and to figure out who you are and what your obstacles are and what your emotional blocks or limitations are. The sooner you can do it, the better. You know, I think in this country at least, everyone goes to the gym. People are going to CrossFit three times a day, but you know, going to therapy is like going to the gym for your brain. Same thing with meditation. I think it\u2019s a mistake for anybody who wants to be successful to not be in therapy or some kind of game plan to edify your brains. That wasn\u2019t a very eloquent way to say it, but that\u2019s it. I would have gone into codependence recovery sooner. I would have put myself first. I think I was so afraid, especially with what I do for a living, I think I was so afraid of coming off like I was like a self-involved narcissist that I didn\u2019t put myself first. I think I would have had more faith. I think I had this mentality of, you know, it\u2019s never going to happen. I\u2019ve got to get it now. And I said yes to things that I shouldn\u2019t have said yes to because I was so worried \u2013 I had a scarcity complex with, you know, if I say no to this, I\u2019m never going to get the opportunity again. And I wish I had said no more, because if I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that saying no just makes people want you more. I don\u2019t have a, you know, proof of that. There\u2019s no statistics. That\u2019s just my experience. But I would have said no a lot more to people, to relationships, to commitments, to jobs, to even lucrative money opportunities that ended up taking up too much of my time. Because we can always make more money; we can never make more time. I think that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have a ton of regrets, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to self-flagellate and to live in the past. You know, I once heard, \u201cLook at the past, but don\u2019t stare.\u201d Right? Look back. What can I glean from my mistakes, but I\u2019m not going to wallow in my mistakes. It\u2019s not productive or helpful. Oh, this is a small thing. If you\u2019re young, I would not have cared about what I wore. I definitely spent \u2013 wasted a lot of time with clothes. What am I going to wear to this meeting? What am I going to wear to this audition? What am I going to wear to this pitch? Nobody cares. I\u2019ve interviewed hundreds of people, held hundreds of auditions. I have never once hired someone because of what they were wearing or not wearing. If anything, I\u2019ve lost respect for them because they looked like they were trying too hard. So, stop obsessing about what you wear. Get three black turtlenecks, four white shirts, couple pairs of nice pants, and timeless, classic shoes, and call it a day. Unless you\u2019re in the fashion business, and maybe that matters. I can\u2019t speak to that, sorry. Eight. Question number eight. Charlotte \u2013 sorry, Charlotte Chapman asks: With equine therapy, what has been the most challenging thing to accept and overcome about yourself as horses are mirrors of your current state of being? On the last podcast, I did mention equine therapy. There is a place that I go to called The Reflective Horse. It does have a website. Cassandra is my equine therapist. She\u2019s brilliant. And Beth Behrs, who is on the show 2 Broke Girls, one of my favorite shows that I created with Michael Patrick King on CBS, she \u2013 they have formed a charity for sexual abuse victims doing equine therapy with them. A lot of rehabs go there. But it\u2019s not just for people who have been through that kind of pain. Equine therapy for me was a game changer, because this is so embarrassing to admit \u2013 people were triggering for me. I mean, I was the person who would go to therapists and lie and cajole them and try to make them laugh and manipulate them, and I was more concerned with my therapist liking me than getting help. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things I wouldn\u2019t admit to my therapist, much less myself. I was resentful towards therapists. I was sitting there like, gee, looking at their degrees on the wall like, oh, you went to Harvard? You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through. Like, it was too triggering for me. Driving to a therapist\u2019s office and then their stupid chairs and their dumb coffee tables. Like, it was too triggering for me. It was too frustrating. I had too much judgement. I had too much self-righteous indignation. I had overachiever\u2019s perfectionism. I shouldn\u2019t be here, this is a waste of time. I should be working. It was before I knew that, you know, therapy actually makes you more productive and efficient and effective and creative in your work. And yeah, so, therapy didn\u2019t work for me at first as much as I\u2019m encouraging everybody to try it. Horse \u2013 I grew up around horses, so, I already felt safe and a kinship with them. But, you know, horses are prey animals, so, they are incredibly in tuned \u2013 they can read a bobcat\u2019s face and tell if it\u2019s hungry or not. You know? So, they\u2019re like a litmus test. They\u2019re a mirror, really, to what\u2019s going on with you. And horses don\u2019t understand lies. They don\u2019t understand manipulation of beguiling, charm \u2013 all the things that we\u2019ve developed in order to make people like us. That\u2019s all rendered useless with a horse. Horses, you know, you can be scared of a horse, and the horse understands and will attune to you. You can not be scared of a horse, and a horse will understand and be attuned to you. But if you are scared and you\u2019re pretending you\u2019re not, horses get very confused, because they don\u2019t know what lying is. Animals don\u2019t lie. They don\u2019t have that capacity, which I\u2019m very jealous of. So, you have to be constitutionally honest with yourself around a horse or they won\u2019t respond to you. So, that, to me, is just \u2013 have been a bulletproof way to work the muscle of being present and shedding all of my what in a 12-step program we call character defects, which sounds negative, but it\u2019s really just kind of all of the survival mechanisms that we develop to succeed in our childhood, our family of origin circumstances. So, some of us got funny. Some of us got smart. Some of us got manipulative. Some of us got negative. Some of us got, you know, addicted to drugs. Whatever you did to fit into your family of origin\u2019s dysfunctional system the horses don\u2019t care about. So, that\u2019s really been how I have been able to acquiesce and work on not pulling out all the stops. You know, I\u2019m trying to think of a new way to explain it that\u2019s not redundant with last time I was on. But I\u2019m kind of at the point now when, you know \u2013 well, the first thing you do when you go in is she introduces you to four horses, and they\u2019re all from different pasts, abused in some way. This is Chief. Chief was a work horse and no one ever paid attention to him. This is so-and-so, he was abused by this person. And she then \u2013 whatever their backstory is. And then she says, which one would you like to work with today? And the one that you choose already is like a Rorschach test. It already says everything about you, what you\u2019re attracted to, right? And so then you get to sort of look into why you chose that horse and what\u2019s going on with you. And then now, you know, I\u2019ll just be in the corral with one of the horses and for about an hour, which is my nightmare, because it feels so unproductive, and I drove all the way out here, and I\u2019m just sitting in a corral, and I\u2019m not even getting Instagram photos out of it, and I need to take a selfie for snapchat to get followers, you know? It\u2019s just \u2013 you know, it\u2019s like our hyperactive, you know, productivity-obsessed brains. And when I\u2019m thinking positive thoughts \u2013 this sounds so hippy \u2013 but when I\u2019m thinking positive thoughts and am full of gratitude, the horse, Chief, will come up to me and hang out with me, and I\u2019ll be petting him, and we\u2019ll be having kind of this amazing moment. And then of course, the negative thoughts creep in, and I\u2019m like, I should be working harder. I need to go home. I need to do this and this and this this week, da, da, da, da. And I\u2019m falling behind, and I\u2019m never going to make it. Blah blah blah. And the horse will just walk to the other side of the corral. She wants nothing to do with my negativity. And Cassandra will just be like, what\u2019s going on? What just happened? And I\u2019m like, my inner monologue just started screaming bloody murder. So, it\u2019s kind of an immediate way to ascertain your negativity. Horses are just really attuned to it, and they don\u2019t like it. Most animals don\u2019t. But it also makes you realize what your energy is, what you\u2019re giving off, you know? I think humans, when we\u2019re not on our phones and hyper-distracted, we have that, too. And if you want to be a leader, if you want to be a boss, if you want to be a creator, whatever your goal is, you know, if you have bad energy, you\u2019re not going to get what you want. You know, you\u2019re not going to get the employees you want, you\u2019re not going to get the boyfriend you want or the wife you want or the investor that you want. You know, I think for the most part maybe I\u2019m wrong. People tend to invest in higher and work with people that have good energy, that they want to be around. You know, most of \u2013 if you work at a job \u2013 we spend more time with people we work with than our spouses, right? So, you know, I think that it\u2019s really important that if you want to accomplish your goals, you need to have good energy and be the kind of person that someone wants to be around that\u2019s not like, negative and depleting. You know when someone just has bad energy. It\u2019s toxic, and it suffocates a creative environment. It\u2019s exhausting. And, you know, for me, it took \u2013 therapists could not do it for me. I had to go to horses first in order to get some self-awareness. So, that\u2019s that. If you don\u2019t live in California, which I\u2019m sure most of you don\u2019t, I\u2019m sure you can find equine therapy in your area. Hopefully. I think it\u2019s a miracle. Let\u2019s see. Aspen Janae Mole-Kiahi. Is that French, or am I literate? Aspen asks: More on therapy outside traditional talk therapy. I resonated with her speaking about her therapeutic experiences and realizing she was responding inappropriately to present circumstances.  I feel like I probably literally beat a dead horse on therapy so far. One thing I would say is if you have trauma in your past, EMDR is great. Eye-movement reprogramming and desensitization. Look it up. I won\u2019t waste your time talking about it. Again, EMDR. I\u2019ve also had some success with hypnosis. When I\u2019m having like, a block or, you know, trying to get through something, that has worked for me. My therapist does hypnosis. I don\u2019t know if all of them do. I\u2019m sure you can find it in your area. I have some great books that I also recommend. If you feel like you\u2019re recreating your childhood circumstances in professional environments, there\u2019s a great book called The Drama of the Gifted Child. Love that. There\u2019s a book called The Tools by Phil Stutz and Barry Michels maybe. This book I\u2019m going to just, full disclosure, I think it\u2019s a little amateur in places. I\u2019m a big fan of Phil Stutz. He did a great podcast with Marc Maron. He\u2019s sort of a gangster old-school therapist in L.A. I\u2019ve never met him. He has very fancy sort of people. But super cool dude. And they wrote a book called The Tools. And it\u2019s all of the devices I guess you would call it, tools, that they have developed to help people get through blocks and have breakthroughs. For example, they have one that\u2019s called reversal of desire where if you\u2019re afraid of something, the best way to get over the fear is to start to crave what you fear. Pretty fascinating. To basically live the worst-case scenario of your fear. So, if your worst fear is getting fired, for example, or losing your money, or whatever it is, or not getting that job, or not selling your app or whatever it is, you essentially have to live through what that would be like. You know, it\u2019s kind of like, jumping through a glass wall. The hardest part is just getting through it, and then you realize you\u2019re going to survive whatever it is. That\u2019s probably a terrible way of explaining it. And another one is, I think it\u2019s called deathbed where when you\u2019re having trouble making a decision, you imagine and visualize yourself on your deathbed and basically what you\u2019re going to regret and not regret and what decision you wish you had made. There\u2019s another one called jeopardy, I think, where you picture yourself being, I think, in extreme jeopardy, and the choices you would make. There\u2019s another really good one that I don\u2019t remember. But it has all these little anecdotes and stories that kind of bored me as a type-A person who just wants the solution now. But I highly recommend that book. Let\u2019s see. I wrote some other stuff down that I think is probably \u2013 we\u2019ve covered. There\u2019s a great book called Sapiens. A book by Yuval Noah Harari. I hope I\u2019m not mispronouncing that. You know, that really helped me, because I think that knowing about your neurology, all of our neurology and sort of our primitive chemical reactions is very liberating in order to, not change them or harness them, but understand them. It helps me have patience with myself and other people. The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine. There\u2019s a male brain as well. I think that both genders reading both are important, again, even though gender lines I think are becoming blurred. I think if you\u2019re having trouble with someone at work and you understand, like, oh, that\u2019s just testosterone, you\u2019re going to waste less time obsessing over other people\u2019s behavior if you sort of understand how they\u2019re operating. Back to Sapiens. Sapiens is a great book about sort of how we\u2019ve evolved and why we have anxiety, you know? You know, I think anxiety is \u2013 I feel everyone has got anxiety these days. And I think there are a lot of reasons. I think a lot of it is our phone, our computer. You know, our primordial brain apparently, from what I gather. I\u2019m not a scientist \u2013 thinks that\u2019s the sun. It\u2019s very adrenalizing. It makes us release cortisol, which is a stress hormone. We\u2019re constantly in a bent over position, which I actually on Tim\u2019s podcast with Gabby Reece and Laird Hamilton, she was talking about how when we\u2019re bent over that\u2019s a defensive posture, when we\u2019re on our computers and on our phones, which is what signals our brain that we\u2019re in trouble and puts us in a fight or flight response. I think it was in Sapiens he talks about how humans are superficially at the top of the food chain. We don\u2019t deserve to be there. It\u2019s only because we developed weapons and alarm systems and doors that we\u2019re safe. But if you put me with a lion in a room without a gun, I\u2019m going to lose. We\u2019re really at the bottom of the food chain. I mean, bees can kill us. That\u2019s how vulnerable we are. So, there is this anxiety that comes from our subconscious knowing that we\u2019re actually superficially at the top of the food chain and could be killed by a bee at any minute. I don\u2019t know. You know, take what you like, and leave the rest, if any of that is helpful to you. And the question was, oh, other therapy. Yeah, so, for me also, learning about neurology has been a type of therapy for me to help me to be more productive, to be more patient, less anxious, or when I am anxious to have a better understanding why. Ten, question ten. Zack Edward Dolan wants to know: I want to do standup in addition to my normal day job, but open mic night is only three minutes per performer at our local club. I have hours of material I want to try out.  Well, Zack, tough shit. You know, that\u2019s very normal. I started that way. You know, the Comedy Store open mic was \u2013 you know, you wait around three hours to go up for three minutes. What I would say is that although that sounds like a, you know, a comically small amount of time, the first couple of years you\u2019re doing standup, you\u2019re really just getting comfortable on stage. It\u2019s not about the material. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re brilliant, Zack, but I highly doubt any of the material you have is going to be in your Netflix special in five years when you do make it. You know, I don\u2019t even remember the material I was doing the first couple of years. The material\u2019s just an excuse to get on stage and get comfortable in front of drunk strangers in a very weird, creepy, seedy environment. If you get on stage and you already feel comfortable, congratulations. You have had something terrible happen to you that that is your comfort zone. But most people don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to strangers. Public speaking I think is one of the biggest fears, if not the biggest fear. So, I would say don\u2019t worry about the amount of time you\u2019re doing. Just get on stage as much as you can. You know, when I started, I was doing standup at bowling alleys and coffee shops, and I mean, anywhere I could get \u2013 sushi places. You know, look on Facebook. There\u2019s a website called Chuckle Monkey I think it\u2019s called. There might be better ones that have lists of open mics in your area. I mean, I used to have to drive 40 minutes to this place called Canoga Park, and it was a bowling alley, and I waited forever to do two minutes. I mean, it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s hard. There\u2019s a reason so few people do standup. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s time-consuming. It\u2019s depleting. I\u2019m not telling you it\u2019s easy. But it is worth it if this is really your passion. Another suggestion I have is start your own show. That\u2019s something that I did when I started, because I was frustrated by not getting stage time, because number one, I wasn\u2019t good. No one was going to give me stage time. I didn\u2019t deserve it yet. And the places that I could, the open mics were only three minutes. So, I started my own show, which is a way to give other comics time, but also to ensure every week that you\u2019re going to have stage time. So, I hosted a show. It was a lot of work. I\u2019m not pretending it\u2019s not. To book comics and schedule them and do a lineup and get an audience. But with Facebook and stuff, I mean, I\u2019m sure you can get an audience, even if it\u2019s five people. That\u2019s an audience. I did standup in the basement of the Ramada in Los Feliz every Sunday for two people, or sometimes just for other comics. You might just be doing standup for the comics that are coming that want stage time themselves. If you can make a comic laugh, you\u2019re in good shape. So, that\u2019s actually pretty good practice. And you know, so, I would say start your own show at a restaurant, at a church, at a \u2013 you know, room, at a gym. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just about getting on stage. Actually, the less people see you probably the better, because in the beginning, at least I was a disgrace. I don\u2019t have any books. He also is asking if I recommend standup books. No. I don\u2019t know any. I\u2019m sure there are some good ones out there, but I would actually recommend instead of reading how to write jokes books I would just watch specials. Watch people you admire. Watch Bill Burr. Watch Louis C.K. Watch George Carlin. Watch the greats. Watch Dave Attell. Not to copy them, but to, you know, sort of figure out why you\u2019re laughing. Write it down. When you make your friends laugh, write down what they laugh at. Read books that interest you that you could use as a starting off point for jokes. You know, I read a book \u2013 I brought it up many times. I read The Female Brain, and I couldn\u2019t stop writing jokes. It wasn\u2019t a joke book. It\u2019s a neurology book. But it sparked creativity in me, and became a lot of the premises that I wrote jokes about. So, I would \u2013 my suggestion would be don\u2019t go buy \u2013 spend a bunch of money on joke books. Spend a bunch of money on interesting books that will inspire you to write material. Okay. What is next? Gosh, I am winded. Doing a podcast, it\u2019s a lot of core. Lot of ab work. Oh, another thing I would say, I wrote this down to remind myself. I mean, it\u2019s 2017, and you could also start like a funny Twitter feed to try jokes out. It\u2019s obviously a very different kind of reaction. It\u2019s not an involuntary laugh. But, you know, Rob Delaney and a lot of people got funny Twitter feeds. You can do that from any city. You know, try that. I don\u2019t know. Could work. A lot of people are getting book deals and shows off of funny Twitter feeds, and that\u2019s something you can do from your own home and not have to drive to go do three minutes on stage. I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Next one. Chris Unera asks: With the rise of relatable identity-based storytelling, comedic content across social platforms, and media publishers, is it more difficult to write sets without being perceived as a hack comedian?  I felt the need to put this question in. It\u2019s redundant, so, I\u2019m not going to answer the first part. But in terms of the being perceived as a hack comedian, I just thought that was interesting, because Chris, you might be codependent, FYI. Let\u2019s date. I think one of the most important parts of anything you do is not giving a shit how you\u2019re perceived. I promise you, that is not how good work gets done. I promise you. This is a lesson I still have to teach myself every day. It is not something that comes naturally to me. But you will never be able to control how people perceive you. And if you think you can, I mean, write a book, because you will become very rich. You know, we all see things through our own lens, right? And everyone is going to perceive what I do differently. I might trigger them. I might remind them of their ex-wife. I might remind them of their mom. I might \u2013 they might love me because I remind them of their best friend, and I don\u2019t deserve as much credit as they\u2019re giving me. It doesn\u2019t matter. Stay in your lane, and don\u2019t worry about what other people think. You know, doing what we do, if you\u2019re an artist, if you\u2019re a writer, if you\u2019re a businessperson, everything we do, everything that I think everyone listening to this is trying to achieve, the hardest thing to do, but I think the most important skill, is to make people like you for a living without giving a shit if they like you. It\u2019s a tricky one to turn on and off. I realize it is my job to make people like me, but I can\u2019t care if they do. It\u2019s a hard thing to delineate, and I\u2019m confusing myself as I say it. But I believe the skill is detachment. You have to care how people receive your product, but be completely detached about how they receive your product. If you\u2019re in a customer service-related business, maybe this is terrible advice. But I believe that when you care too much about what someone thinks, it\u2019s a desperate energy that actually backfires on you and gives them too much power, and they then start not to like you. I used to be very consumed by if people liked me or not, and it was very unattractive. And I felt like I was doing too much. And everyone that we like \u2013 actors, comedians \u2013 they\u2019re not begging you to like them, because they have a confidence in who they are and what they\u2019re doing. And they like themselves. So, what I would say is, figure out \u2013 this sounds so, you know, Marianne Williamson Oprah \u2013 but liking yourself is way more likeable than needing people to like you, if that makes any sense. Maybe it doesn\u2019t. You know, and it also helped me to understand neurology and codependence and all this stuff, because I was able to develop the skill of detachment because I realized that whether people liked me or not, or what someone\u2019s reaction to me is a lot of times has nothing to do with me, because they could be projecting all their own stuff onto me. I\u2019ve already said that. I\u2019m saying it again in a different way. But that was a little bit of a cheat for me, and I stopped thinking about it and obsessing about it so much because it\u2019s out of my control. Obsessing about something you can\u2019t control is a form of insanity. Something that I feel like might be good advice that a guy named Byron Allen gave me this advice. I don\u2019t know if you know Byron Allen. He I think was the youngest person to ever host The Tonight Show. I don\u2019t need to give you statistics. You can Google him, you\u2019re an adult. But he\u2019s got a lot of shows. He randomly has syndicated shows on local networks that come on at sort of two in the morning. I don\u2019t \u2013 I just know because I get Tweets of a show I hosted of his eight years ago that\u2019s still running in random markets at four a.m. Very embarrassing. Sorry about my haircut. Weird bangs back then. But he is incredibly successful. And one time he called me into his office to talk about something, and he gave me really great advice, which was, don\u2019t worry about getting new fans. Just satisfy the fans that you already have. Which was like, blindsided me, because I thought it was get as many people to like you as possible. His thing is more, be loyal to the people who already support you instead of hording a bunch of people who kind of like you. Getting a tribe of \u2013 and now I\u2019m improvising. This isn\u2019t all what he said. But what I would say is find your tribe of people who really get you and honor them, because if you start trying to please everybody, you please nobody. I\u2019m plagiarizing that from someone, obviously. We\u2019ve heard that a million times. But you know, you\u2019ll never make everyone like you. It\u2019s not going to happen, unless you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9. So, don\u2019t bother. And in terms of the hack thing, you know, I guess what I would say is for the most part, usually when people call you a hack, it\u2019s a compliment, because it just means you\u2019re really popular. [You know, something happens in the entertainment business where if you get too much success, people all of a sudden think you suck, which I think is kind of funny, because no other field does that happen. No one\u2019s like, this George Foreman grill must suck, because everyone has one. This is sort of anathema to logic. But you know, I think that also understanding that humans have a sort of \u2013 we are predisposed to have kind of a primordial need to judge and be negative. I think it\u2019s just our tribal us against them. It\u2019s why if you\u2019re a Redskins fan you hate Dallas. It\u2019s why if you\u2019re a Stern fan you hate Opie and Anthony, or vice versa. I think we have a predisposition to be us versus them. So, you know, when people want to pit me against other female comedians or podcasters against podcasters or compare, it\u2019s a natural human nature thing that I try not to take too personally. I\u2019m just grateful to be in the ring and being able to do what I love. So, I just try to stay in gratitude, because for my personality, that\u2019s the only place that I can find sanity. And if someone is judging me to feel better about themselves, I want to send them compassion, because I do that, and when I do it, it usually means I feel insufficient or jealous or insecure. So, but that\u2019s just me. Maybe I\u2019m being delusional. But guess what? It\u2019s working. Anyway, so, Byron\u2019s thing. You know, he also had this \u2013 he said in order to be like a huge success, you really only need about a million people to like you. He was pointing out a really successful comedian who was like a household name at the time, and you know, making a million dollars a night selling out these huge arenas, and he did the math on how many people were seeing his shows. I\u2019m awful at math, so, I\u2019m not going to pretend I know how to do this. But he kind of broke it down for me, and he was like, you know, 20,000 seats \u2013 if you\u2019re selling 20,000 seats a night times 50 cities and you know, selling $60.00 tickets, you know, you really only need a million people out of 380 million people in America? So, you don\u2019t even need one percent of people to know who you are in order to be a household name and really successful. So, stop trying to get ten million. Just don\u2019t lose the one million who like you by selling out trying to get the other 300 million. I thought that was good advice. Jamie Leblanc-Sur. Leblanc-Sur. Are you French? I hope so. Given the cons of each facet, what keeps her motivated, and which is her favorite? Writing, standup, acting, etcetera.  I don\u2019t know. I believe in order to be good at one thing you have to do a lot of things. Maybe that\u2019s just how my brain works. I get bored, and I think that all of these things reinforce each other. I think in order to be a good boss, you need to know what it\u2019s like to be an employee. I think in order to, you know, sell an app you have to know what it\u2019s like to need that app. You have to get into the head of, you know, your consumer or your \u2013 you know, I think in order to be a good standup, you have to know what it\u2019s like to be in the audience, you know? I\u2019ll go see standup shows as a patron, you know? I think it\u2019s important. I recently directed a movie, and it made me a better actor. How weird is that? Because I learned about, you know, continuity. Like, when you\u2019re acting and you\u2019re picking up props and stuff, you have to do it the same way every time or else in editing we can\u2019t cut it together. So, if an actor has bad continuity, like for example, on each line, they\u2019re supposed to pick up the coffee cup at the same time. If they pick it up at a different time each take, we can\u2019t edit them together. So, they may have a brilliant performance, but they picked up the coffee cup at the wrong time, so, I can\u2019t use it. So, I\u2019ve done jobs before where I\u2019m like, why did they use that take? That wasn\u2019t my best take. That wasn\u2019t my best performance. How dare they. But I probably made a continuity mistake, which rendered my good take useless. So, I think for me, being a writer, being an actor, being a standup, being a writer and director makes me better at everything. I also think it\u2019s a skill to know what belongs where. So, if you\u2019re a writer, for example, or creative person, you know, I had a lot of sort of stories that weren\u2019t funny enough to be in standup, but I\u2019m trying to make it a standup joke, and I realize, oh, this is a movie idea. This isn\u2019t a standup joke. Or, this should be in a book. Or, I\u2019m writing a book right now, and I\u2019m like, this should be a standup joke. I\u2019m not going to put this \u2013 you know? It\u2019s too jokey to put in a chapter. It feels desperate. I should do this on stage. You know? So, I think having a lot of different outlets is good. You know, if you\u2019re a really creative person and you have a podcast and you have a blog and you have an app and you have a book, you know, knowing what goes where I think is a strong skill to have. One that I\u2019m still honing. But I kind of like all of it, because I think, you know, it\u2019s like going to the gym. You have to do legs, arms. I don\u2019t go to the gym that much, obviously. But you\u2019ve got to do every part of the body. I also think you\u2019ve got to work every part of the brain. Anyway. That\u2019s that. I hope that made some sense. Standup, however, is probably my favorite thing to do. It\u2019s the most thrilling. It\u2019s like walking on a tightrope. I think everyone should do it, even if, you know, I hope Tim decides to jump off that cliff at some point. I think that standup is like skydiving or something. I think everyone should do it at some point. Actually, I take that back. I don\u2019t think anyone should skydive. I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve never done it, never plan on doing it. I\u2019m just saying the feel of standup is that thrilling, and I think you really find out who you are when you do standup. It\u2019s a truth serum. And I think everyone should do it at least once just to try it as a life experience. I highly encourage it. But it makes me feel very awake, alive. It makes me tell the truth, because the audience only responds to the truth. And as somebody who, you know, as a performer, sometimes I want to perform, and the audience doesn\u2019t let you. The audience is a litmus test in a lot of ways, and like horses, forces you to be honest. And as someone who, you know, as a kid developed the skill of being dishonest in order to be liked and to maintain equilibrium in a hectic home, I need that. I need a reminder to be honest all the time, which sounds sad and dark. But I think a lot of us are taught as kids, man up. Don\u2019t cry. It\u2019s fine. Calm down. And you know, we are constantly inculcated with those messages as children, and as a result, I think a lot of us develop these \u2013 we pretend. We pretend we\u2019re fine when we\u2019re not. We pretend things are funny when we\u2019re not laughing. We pretend to be interested in boring conversations. We lie all day, every day, and it\u2019s exhausting. So, I am trying to deactivate that superpower, which worked really well as a kid, because I got good grades, and my parents, I didn\u2019t get grounded, and I got into a college because of all of this sort of pretending I was fine and pretending I was this and that. And pretending is draining and unoriginal, and it feels like you\u2019re sleepwalking through life and acting through life. This is getting very personal, isn\u2019t it? Next one. Jen Bales says: What steps or advice would she give someone who wants to get their TV script in front of the right people? How do you get people to read your work, especially for those who aren\u2019t living in L.A.? Jen, I don\u2019t know. I felt like I needed to include a question with an answer I didn\u2019t know the answer to, because I\u2019m sure a lot of people have that question. I am sorry to say this, but I do think you have to live in L.A. or New York and hustle. You know, I started doing standup, and I became a writer on a late-night show and started writing scripts, and I had a manager who \u2013 you know, I kind of \u2013 I had an oblique angle. I mean, I was doing standup. But I don\u2019t know how people do that. I have to be really honest with you. I don\u2019t think you can just blind send it to agencies. I would say get \u2013 what I see success in now is people having successful funny Twitter feeds, successful YouTube videos, blogs, podcasts. They come out to L.A. or New York. They do shows at comedy clubs in UCB and, you know, that\u2019s how it happens. You know, there\u2019s Chicago, there\u2019s Portland has a comedy scene. Denver has a big comedy. You know, I do think you might have to be in a metropolitan city. So, as annoying and as expensive as that sounds, I do think that that\u2019s a big part of it. From what I have seen statistically, that seems to be what works. But I would say you can\u2019t have someone read your script until you write it, so, write a script, read scripts, watch episodes of great shows. Cheers, Mad About You, Pilot. Watch great shows. Watch shows that you like. Write specs for those shows. A spec is an example, like, an episode of a show that you\u2019d want to write for. You can write a spec for The Office, for example. You\u2019re not going to get a job on The Office, because it\u2019s not on anymore, but people then read that spec, and they go, oh, this person can write for this show. They can write for \u2013 they have a voice. But they also can conform to the voice of a show they didn\u2019t create. So, if I\u2019m hiring a TV writer, I read a spec script. They write a spec for How I Met Your Mother, or Modern Family, or whatever it is. You cannot submit a spec to a show that is the show. So, if you want to write on 2 Broke Girls, I can\u2019t read a 2 Broke Girls spec, because it\u2019s a legal nightmare, and you\u2019ll sue me, and, you know. It\u2019s happened, and continues to happen. So, if you want to write for Big Bang Theory, don\u2019t write a Big Bang Theory spec. Write a Mike & Molly spec, or something else that\u2019s currently on. And try to get it to an agent and get to a metropolitan city, as savage and cold-blooded as that sounds. Okay, we have to wrap this up soon. I feel like this is going on really long. Addy Seagull: Where do most of your ideas and jokes come from? Do they jump to your mind while you\u2019re doing other things? Shower, gym, etcetera, or is there a specific thinking process?  A little bit of both. You know, again, I think you have to be relentless in your pursuit of inspiration. I read the news every morning. I read books. You know, I ask people questions. I\u2019m really annoying to have dinner with, because all I do is ask questions about your personal life and your sex life and your \u2013 do you believe in religion, and who are you, trying to mine for jokes and spark of something. Or, I\u2019m always kind of subconsciously or consciously building a case for material I have. So, if I decide, you know, a thesis of \u2013 which I mentioned earlier, which again, I believe sounds slightly mentally ill \u2013 that married people are more successful. Happily married, let\u2019s say that. But people in stable relationships. If I\u2019m with a successful person, I\u2019ll ask them about their marriage and how is it and do you fight and what do you fight about and how often do you fight and do they support your career? I\u2019m building a case, trying to \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 being a comedian, for me at least, is kind of like being a scientist. You have to come up with \u2013 Chris Rock said this. That you have to come up with a ridiculous theory and then prove it. So, you know, for example, cars are like women. Ridiculous theory. Right? That\u2019s not that ridiculous, but you know what I mean. Something no one\u2019s ever heard before, like a big comparison or simile. Cars are like women. And then you prove it. The jokes, you have to get a new one every three years. They come in six colors. Whatever the funny proof is, right? They lose their value as soon as you take them off the lot. Etcetera, etcetera. Insert funny joke here. So, I guess I\u2019m always sort of looking for a ridiculous theory to prove or something common or annoying. Usually when something annoys me or keeps me up at night, I want to write about it. Anything that\u2019s \u2013 you know, Neil Brennan, I just feel the need to credit everybody I\u2019m quoting \u2013 says, you know, comedians are obsessed with justice. I think that\u2019s true. Louis C.K. says if you think about something more than three times a week, you need to write a joke about it. So, that\u2019s that. Let\u2019s see. Oh, I also would like to say that in the first podcast I did with Tim, I feel like I want to do a redo on my billboard, when he says, if you could have a billboard anywhere, what would it say? I don\u2019t remember what I said, but I remember panicking. I listen to Tim\u2019s show, but I remember being like, I\u2019m not going to listen. I\u2019m just going to go on, and I\u2019m going to be authentic, and I\u2019m just going to tell my truth and channel whatever the viewers need to hear. And then I got on there, and I was like, I should have prepared for this, because the billboard question really stumped me, and I felt very dumb and like I bombed it. And I now have a better answer that I would like to say, which is I\u2019m plagiarizing from Peter Burg, the director who is, you know, brilliant man. He did Friday Night Lights and he\u2019s great and is a dear friend and has taught me a lot. Really smart dude. He once sent me an email or whatever it was just with the word \u2013 I was going through a hard professional time, and I was struggling, and he just wrote in capital letters, \u201cFinish.\u201d The word finish. F-i-n-i-s-h. Finish. This sounds really simple and obvious, but it is something that was \u2013 that I needed to hear, because I think anyone listening to this podcast, myself included, I want to do so many things. I have so many ideas. Anyone can have ideas. But the ones that succeed are the ones that execute and push it across the finish line. And for me, those last three steps, that last sprint, is always the hardest for me, because I\u2019m tired and I lose enthusiasm, and I feel resentful and entitled that I\u2019ve worked this hard, and blah blah blah. Finish. You have to finish what you start. You know? I was the person who had five books by my bed, and I\u2019d read only chapter one. I\u2019m the person that started four scripts and finished zero. Do one thing at a time, and finish it, instead of doing five things and not completing them. That formula I believe, having done both, I\u2019ve had more success with this one. The starting thing doesn\u2019t count. No one wins awards for starting a script. No one\u2019s going to read a script that\u2019s twelve pages. It\u2019s got to be 100 pages. You can start things all day long, but if you can\u2019t finish them, you\u2019re wasting everybody\u2019s time. So, that would be my billboard. I just felt the need to \u2013 my ego felt the need to improve upon my answer. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all done it. We\u2019ve all been like, oh, I thought of that. I thought of Uber. I thought of Tinder. Ugh. But some other guy finished it, right? And executed it. So, you know, I think that committing to one thing is admirable. I have a very hard time with it. I\u2019m not saying I know how to do it well. But if you do, I will be working for you one day. As another quote, I\u2019ll close with this quote. Vince Lombardi, a quote that I really love. He said, \u201cInches make champions. Inches.\u201d I tend to think in miles and feet. But sometimes it comes down to inches, and that\u2019s something that I used to have on my computer on a little Post-It note. I don\u2019t really know how to dismount on this. I hope that this was helpful. I hope that I wasn\u2019t blathering too much and boring you guys. I wish it was funnier, but I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what this was supposed to be, so, I\u2019m just going to release my self-criticism. Okay, I have to log in to undo this. Okay, I hope you guys are happy, and thank you for listening, if you\u2019ve even gotten this far. I hope this was useful in any way. I\u2019m on Twitter, @WhitneyCummings. I\u2019m on Snapchat. I\u2019m on all of it. I try to engage as much as I can with people on social media. Tim I think, all the books and stuff that I talked about I\u2019m sure will put on his site. I\u2019m actually writing a book at the moment, which is going to come out in the fall, and I hope to include a lot of this stuff because people seem to be responding to, you know, kind of healing our brains in order to be better at what we do and more productive and effective and live for fulfilling lives. So, I hope that you guys \u2013 I can finish this book, which is why I have to get off, stop recording this podcast, because I have to write the God-damned book and finish it. Look at us. Okay, thank you. This feels anticlimactic. Love you. Bye!

the move this year", "that\u2019s how profoundly it changed my life, because i believe that the more we know about our neural brain wiring, the more freedom we have and the more patience we have with ourselves", "that\u2019s another story, we\u2019ll get to that", "but i\u2019m trying to be concise about this", "but if you grew up in a chaotic environment, inconsistent environment, were rewarded for one thing on tuesday and punished for the same thing the next day, you know, children get confused by stuff like that", "any kind of mental disorders, distractions growing up", "a divorce, a trauma", "or, you grew up in a relatively copacetic environment and still have a preoccupation with other people\u2019s needs because it gives you meaning", "you know, codependence can manifest from anything from exhausting yourself worrying about other people, finding yourself in relationships or attracted to people who you can rescue or fix", "i find myself \u2013 i think my codependent bottom was, you know, being in a relationship with somebody who i had to take care of, you know, financially, emotionally", "caused me a tremendous amount of stress", "oh, i didn\u2019t \u2013 jumping around", "i didn\u2019t finish my thought on epigenetic imprinting", "that\u2019s when in utero, a child becomes addicted to stress chemicals in the womb because the mother is stressed out", "so, if you grew up around a tense marriage, tension in general, any kind of anxiety", "low-income homes are particularly susceptible to this, because of the constant financial stress", "so, if your mother, in utero, in producing adrenaline, cortisol, norepinephrine, phenylethylamine, all these chemicals, the fetus then becomes addicted to it the same way a crack baby would \u2013 a lot of crack babies are born with an addiction to crack", "tragic, obviously", "but i had a predisposition to be addicted to adrenaline", "and i, as an adult, recreated my childhood circumstances by seeking out relationships that caused me stress and adrenaline", "that\u2019s what was familiar to me", "it felt safe", "it\u2019s all i knew", "you know, a lot of people i know who have a lot of anxiety in their life and stress and drama, you know, and me, before i was in recovery, we lament it and hate it, but yet we find ourselves over and over again subconsciously gravitating towards those kinds of relationships, jobs, circumstances", "so, codependence more specifically can manifest in everything from going to dinners you don\u2019t want to go to, going to baby showers", "you know, when someone asks me if they\u2019re codependent \u2013 and i\u2019m self-diagnosed, i can\u2019t tell you \u2013 i usually say, look at your calendar and look at your verbiage, the way that you talk", "do you say, \u201ci have to go to this thing next week", "i have to go to this wedding", "i have to pick my friend up from the airport.\u201d you don\u2019t have to do any of those things", "codependence tells us that we do, that we can\u2019t say no", "maybe we grew up in a situation where we had to do things that we didn\u2019t want to do, or had to walk on eggshells around other people\u2019s feelings", "our parents", "maybe our parents were fragile or very sensitive, and as a result, we think it\u2019s appropriate or necessary to constantly go through life doing things that we don\u2019t want to do", "i also \u2013 if you have a hard time receiving, it\u2019s very easy for you to give but hard for you to receive", "used to receiving gifts or help made me really uncomfortable", "my comfort zone was helping other people and focusing on their needs", "i never admitted to having needs before i was in recovery for codependence", "i couldn\u2019t ask for help", "i couldn\u2019t say uncle", "there was no amount of work i wouldn\u2019t take on", "i didn\u2019t know how to put my health first", "i gave more than i had", "i\u2019m feeling myself being very vague, which is also a codependent thought", "we beat ourselves up", "we obsess over what other people think about us", "we worry that other people don\u2019t like us", "and it\u2019s draining", "you know", "people always say, like, but i like that about myself", "and don\u2019t you need that to be successful", "and, what if i\u2019m just nice and i help other people and i go to baby showers even though i don\u2019t want to", "isn\u2019t that just being nice", "yes, there is, you know, the reason this is such a nefarious condition is because it\u2019s so socially acceptable, and you can kind of file it under being nice", "being in recovery for codependence doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be nice anymore and do nice things", "you just, your mode has changed, because being nice for the wrong reasons actually isn\u2019t nice", "it\u2019s selfish", "if i\u2019m doing something nice for you because i want you to think i\u2019m nice, that\u2019s like borderline sociopathic, right", "that\u2019s manipulative", "that\u2019s not a pure intention", "if i\u2019m doing something nice for you because i want to be of service with no strings attached, you know, that is admirable", "so, you know, i hope that this is a sufficient answer", "i don\u2019t want to spend the whole time talking about codependence", "there\u2019s so much to cover in it", "but i do think it might be pertinent to tim\u2019s listeners, because codependents often have a paralyzing issue with perfectionism", "i suffer from this, and it sounds like maybe being dramatic, but i really struggle with perfectionism", "i can\u2019t turn things in on time, staying up until four in the morning, changing the font on a document", "you know, i\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but before recording this podcast, i started it \u2013 i tried it four times, and i was like, \u201chi, i\u2019m whitney.\u201d that was stupid", "\u201chi, i\u2019m whitney.\u201d that was even dumber", "you\u2019re an idiot", "you know", "that\u2019s a waste of time", "so, what i would say is that codependence, ultimately, it\u2019s stressful, it\u2019s exhausting, it ages you", "it ultimately makes people resent you", "it makes you resent people", "it\u2019s dishonest", "but it\u2019s also unproductive", "so, i feel like it might be helpful to some listeners", "if you find yourself wasting time going to events you don\u2019t want to go to, being friends with people that you don\u2019t like", "i mean, before i was in recovery for codependence, i didn\u2019t think i had a choice in the kind of people i was friends with", "of course, tim says you\u2019re the average of the four people you spend time with", "and before program, i just was friends with anyone who asked because i didn\u2019t know i was allowed to say no to people", "you know, and i took on work that i shouldn\u2019t, that was a waste of time, just because i was like, if i don\u2019t do this, then they\u2019re not going to hire me for this, and what if they don\u2019t like me, and what if they\u2019re mad at me", "like, this inner monologue is really a giant waste of time, and self-flagellating, ultimately", "and you know, something we say in codependence recovery is that perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis", "so, when we have perfectionism, we can\u2019t get work done", "we can\u2019t be creative", "we can\u2019t work from our energy source or from our heart because we\u2019re so stuck in a self-critical state of, that was stupid, that sucked, that wasn\u2019t good enough, no one\u2019s going to like this, you\u2019re going to fail", "that inner monologue is \u2013 rewriting that inner monologue has been a big part of my codependent recovery", "if you want to know more about codependence i would say read a book called codependent no more by melanie beatty", "i hope i\u2019m pronouncing her last name right", "you might not relate to everything", "you might just relate to some things", "but i find that you know, this has been a huge part of me sort of breaking the cycle of codependence, which i think has been passed on from generation to generation in this country, because alcoholism has been passed on", "learning about alcoholism also has really helped me", "alcohol used to be in water before the 1900s as an antiseptic", "people couldn\u2019t drink water without alcohol", "i mean, alcohol is just such a big part of the fabric of this country, and i think we\u2019re sort of paying the emotional price now", "we\u2019re kind of the first generation kind of trying to rectify the, you know, repercussions of this disease", "and it sort of reaches far and wide", "let me move on, because i could talk about that forever", "tiffany savin", "oh, she\u2019s asking about codependency as well", "she\u2019s asking:  how you know if you\u2019re codependent", "i feel like i sort of covered that", "you know, something else i\u2019ll just say really quick is, codependents tend to not have fun and hobbies in their life", "this is embarrassing to admit, but before i was in recovery for codependence, i didn\u2019t have fun", "that sounds weird", "like, i would go to a party, and i would be like \u2013 i felt like i was performing fun or just trying to get it over with", "i had a hard time being present because i was so in my head about having fun perfectly", "and it\u2019s like having a \u2013 you know what", "codependency is like having a sports announcer constantly weighing in on your performance in life, you know", "whitney walked into the party", "she said hi to that guy", "that didn\u2019t go well", "she just embarrassed herself", "why did she bring that up", "that was weird", "now she has food in her teeth", "like, it\u2019s a constant sort of negative underpinning, and shaming", "i mean, i used to have the inner monologue of, you should be home, you should be working, you\u2019re falling behind, and you should be working harder", "you know, for codependents, it\u2019s never enough", "for me, i think the last thing i\u2019ll say is, you know, especially for tim\u2019s listeners, which i know you guys are all very sort of ambitious people with a lot of goals, it\u2019s finding that balance between overworking and codependently working", "i think my codependence has been an engine for me to get a lot done, but it has backfired", "there\u2019s a certain point where i have burnt out and wasted a lot of time worrying about what other people think or spending that extra hour making something perfect in my brain, which no one cares if it\u2019s double-spaced or single-spaced", "i could have gotten an hour of sleep instead", "recovery from codependence helps me to prioritize my health so that i don\u2019t burn out", "before recovery and being in a 12-step program, i worked so hard that i got pneumonia", "so, you know, it\u2019s i guess diminishing marginal returns", "would that be the concept", "i don\u2019t know where i got that from", "but there\u2019s a certain point where you work so hard that you actually become unproductive or you make yourself sick or you\u2019re tired or your friendships suffer or your hobbies suffer, or, you know, you need a personal life in order to be, i think, a good artist, or a good businessperson", "i believe in order for art to imitate life, you have to have a life", "and if you\u2019re a businessperson, you have to know what people want", "if you\u2019re selling a product to people, you have to know people", "so, that\u2019s all i will say, because i\u2019m very concerned that i\u2019m being a broken record", "francisco israel asks: i would like to see a deconstruction of what makes stuff funny", "what is the fabric of humor", "like a quick, to be funny,

about 12 years", "i still can\u2019t tell you the y = mx + b of why something is funny, which i think is why i love doing this so much", "it\u2019s mysterious, it\u2019s elusive", "different things

might actually be funnier than the way i do it", "but if that makes any sense", "what makes somebody funny is, i think, a combination of the truth, high-stakes, and their essence", "you know, sebastian maniscalco, i know i brought him up on the last broadcast, but he\u2019s fascinating to me because if you were to transcribe his act, for the most part, there\u2019s not a lot of jokes in it

and you know, as a person, he\u2019s funny as well, but something happens when he goes on stage that it\u2019s an intersection between him and the audience, so, the energy of the audience plays a really big role, which is, you know, changes every night", "the audience is different every night, which means why something\u2019s funny is different every night", "it\u2019s fascinating to me", "you know, i think that i do know that if you want to do comedy or be a writer, you know, even if you want to be a businessperson, i think this probably matters", "i think apple does a good job with this and understands the role of surprise", "surprise is, i think, one some level the most important part of comedy, at least the kind that i do", "if you surprise someone, they will usually laugh, either it\u2019s a negative surprise or a positive surprise", "you\u2019ve seen people watch horror movies", "you\u2019ve seen a surprise party", "surprise is important, and it\u2019s really hard to surprise people these days", "it seems like everybody\u2019s become so desensitized", "so, if you can do that, i think you\u2019re going to get everything you want in life", "you know, and there\u2019s also some funny stuff that i can\u2019t explain", "i remember specifically like, maybe like, eight years ago, there was this comedian", "his name was fadem", "really funny guy", "sort of alternative comedian", "and he was on stage at the improv, and i remember i was waiting to go up, and i was just a young, you know, kid", "i had no idea what i was doing", "waiting to go on", "and he \u2013 he\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s almost like performance art what he does, and he does sort of an impression, like a post-modern impression of a comedian, and lot of levels to what he does", "but he started running in place like, in a really dramatic way", "like, flailing and gesticulating, like, out of breath", "like, [panting]", "you can\u2019t see me, so, it\u2019s ridiculous that i\u2019m trying to \u2013 that i\u2019m actually doing this alone in my house", "but he started running in place, and it was really funny at the beginning, because he was like, exhausting himself, and everyone\u2019s kind of laughing", "and then like, 30 seconds past, and i remember being like, okay", "what\u2019s next", "let\u2019s go", "let\u2019s move", "like, you\u2019re milking this, josh", "and then a minute past, and he\u2019s running", "and no one\u2019s laughing at this point", "people are just like, what is he doing", "this person\u2019s having like, a manic break", "he commits to it so hard he goes for like, another 30 seconds", "and i remember at this point just being like, angry", "like, what is he doing up there", "like, this is crazy", "he\u2019s taking stage time from other comedians", "like, a lot of tim ferriss listeners, i\u2019m very obsessed with using my time wisely, and i\u2019m like, this guy is wasting valuable stage time", "two minutes", "about 30 seconds later, he\u2019s still running in place", "the audience starts laughing again", "fifteen, 20 seconds later, we\u2019re laughing so hard i\u2019m crying", "i\u2019m crying laughing", "deepest depths of my gut", "my muscles are killing me", "i had to leave the room i was laughing so hard", "i don\u2019t know what he did", "it was some magical bell curve of funny where he committed so hard to something that we all just \u2013 i still can\u2019t explain it", "i can\u2019t explain it", "and it was one of the funniest things i had ever seen", "you know, he kind of got past the stage of bombing and turned it into this other level of \u2013 i can\u2019t even explain it", "performance art", "but it was surprising", "you know", "the audacity that he had and the bravery", "and it was just \u2013 it was really amazing to see", "and i remember going like, oh, i\u2019ll never understand how comedy works, because this is amazing", "and let\u2019s see, i think things are also funny at different times all the time", "that\u2019s something else that\u2019s kind of amazing about comedy, is something that was funny a month ago might not be funny in two months, you know", "trump jokes were really funny six months ago", "not so funny anymore, you know", "it got real", "you know", "so, that\u2019s something else that is \u2013 you know, you listen to old comedy, and some stuff holds up, but other stuff you\u2019re like, that was funny 20 years ago", "and people are dying in the audience, just crying, you know", "i think it\u2019s definitely harder to be dirty funny, is that makes any sense, because, you know, everybody has seen ite all these days in the age of porn", "how do you say anything dirty anymore", "i think what\u2019s becoming shocking changes, you know", "i think when i started doing standup, you know, this is going to sound gross, but it was a lot of like, aids jokes", "that was like, the edgiest thing you could say", "now that\u2019s not funny, to me at least, personally", "racial jokes are less funny now that, you know, black lives matter, and it\u2019s, you know, ubiquitous on the news, sort of all the racial injustices", "race jokes aren\u2019t that funny to me", "when a white person does a race joke, not as funny", "when a black person does it, you\u2019re like, oh, i have permission \u2013 you know, something different happens", "you know, so, it\u2019s such a case-by-case basis", "so, i guess what i would say is that if you\u2019re trying to be a comedian, don\u2019t worry about what other people are doing", "do your thing", "whatever your essence is, whatever your truth is, i promise you, you are funny in a specific, original way", "talk about your most embarrassing thoughts and your personal experience, because you know, you\u2019re not going to be funny doing daniel tosh\u2019s act", "that\u2019s \u2013 daniel tosh is funny because of his cellular makeup and his dna", "so, i would say just stay specific, and be yourself", "that\u2019s such weird clich\u00e9 advice, but i guess there\u2019s a reason people say it so much", "okay, next question", "i don\u2019t know who asked this", "i deleted his name",

what my take was on howard stern, because when i go on his show, i completely black out and have an out-of-body experience and look down at my shell of a body from above just yelling, please stop saying what you\u2019re saying, because i\u2019m just embarrassing myself at six in the morning, mind you", "so, i\u2019m usually half asleep and in a melatonin hangover", "so, i presume i was relatively negative about it", "i think publicly i have been somewhat cynical about marriage", "a few of you might know this, but i saw three divorces by the time i was 15", "very acrimonious, expensive, court-casey marriages", "so, i think it was inculcated in my brain that marriage just was a giant waste of time and immense source of anxiety and stress", "i now have a little more mature take on it", "i think on some level i wanted to make sure that my beliefs about marriage were at least my own and not a result or core beliefs because of the blueprint i saw growing up", "i, you know, don\u2019t want to be a puppet of the mistakes that my family made", "and if i don\u2019t believe in marriage, i at least want it to be for original reasons", "so, i definitely had a lot of fear around it until recently", "i would say that my opinion has changed on marriage, and the reason that i included this question is because my reasons for thinking that i think might appeal to tim ferriss\u2019 listeners, because i have a little bit of a casual theory going about how the most successful people and the people whose careers i admire are happily married people", "i think it probably is no surprise to anyone that being single is very time consuming, exhausting, and distracting", "it\u2019s a full-time job, especially if you\u2019re online dating like i am", "and i see a lot of value in finding somebody who can be a teammate, and if the person supports your goals, i think it\u2019s a risk that is worth taking, even if it doesn\u2019t pan out", "i believe in marriage", "i also believe strongly in divorce if something isn\u2019t working", "i think the stigma on divorce is obsolete and frankly kind of ridiculous given our recent scientific discoveries about neurology", "yo know, marriage was invented when the life expectancy was 30 years old", "we\u2019re now living to 80", "it\u2019s an unrealistic and unfair pressure and expectation to put on people that a marriage should last forever", "if it does, that\u2019s awesome", "congratulations", "you\u2019re an anomaly", "but if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay", "i hope to have a couple marriages in my lifetime", "i just recently kind of learned the value of teamwork in a relationship and being in a relationship, this is new to me, and i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019ve actually ever been in one of these yet, but it is my goal to be in a relationship that energizes you instead of depletes you", "i have historically been in depleting relationships, and an energizing relationship with somebody who kind of takes you off the market and out of the incredibly distracting single scene i think is really conducive to productivity and achieving your goals", "i think it\u2019s tricky, because the kind of people i think who listen to this podcast and who want to win in life and accomplish all their goals are highly motivated and always looking for an upgrade and to achieve highly in their professional lives", "but, i think the people who are really successful and get to the most admirable echelon in their field have very high standards \u2013 standards probably isn\u2019t the word", "very ambitious professional goals, but in their personal life are not always looking for the upgrade, or looking to achieve highly", "not that marrying someone that, you know, i\u2019m not judging this abstract metaphor, but, you know, i think it\u2019s part human nature and part a type-a personality to always be looking for something better, improving yourself", "i have suffered from debilitating perfectionism", "every time i\u2019m in a relationship, i\u2019m like, should i be with someone smarter, you know, funnier, this, that", "and it\u2019s exhausting", "and i think that a healthy level of acceptance of this person is awesome, i should commit to them, and yes, i could, i\u2019m sure, scour the world for the upgrade, but that\u2019s all relative, and that\u2019s all energy better used to, i think, upgrade yourself, and whatever you\u2019re doing in your work", "so, i\u2019m personally striving to \u2013 the word\u2019s not complacent, but or to settle, but i am personally looking in my personal life to find someone who doesn\u2019t make my life harder, and if i, you know, marriage made sense, i would totally do it if i planned on being with that person", "my expectations, however, i think, have become more realistic", "i don\u2019t expect my personal life to be 50 shades of grey every day", "that\u2019s a form of perfectionism in relationships, to have the best marriage with the most interesting person with the most successful person", "i mean, that\u2019s all \u2013 those are standards that i would like to reserve for my professional life and maybe in my parenting in the future instead of in my partner-seeking, because if someone were to judge me based on the way i judge others, i would never measure up", "so, i\u2019m trying to just kind of have not low expectations, but realistic expectations given what i know about neurology and monogamy and the history of marriage and what it was intended for", "i think i have a much more mature take", "i recently looked into selling my house, and learned that if you\u2019re married, you get to keep a lot more of the money", "so, that\u2019s a very mercenary take, but if i\u2019m with somebody, i\u2019m not going to \u2013 it makes no sense to be with someone for ten years and not marry them just for a stubborn, you know, fake qualm with the institution of marriage", "you know, i no longer think it\u2019s cool or hip to be negative about marriage", "but i do have realistic expectations", "i think i said before, i believe in divorce", "i believe strongly in prenups", "i don\u2019t think that means you anticipate it ending", "i think it\u2019s just a really smart safety net", "i think they\u2019re on legalzoom", "you don\u2019t have to have money to have a prenup", "it just makes things \u2013 i just think it\u2019s a smart decision", "i would do that even if you never use it", "when you ask for a prenup or have that discussion you find out who the other person is, so, you can also use talking about a prenup to find out what kind of person the other person you might be marring is", "and i also would never marry someone that i don\u2019t think would handle a divorce with grace and class", "i think to expect a relationship to last forever i think is slightly unfair because hopefully i want to be the kind of person who\u2019s growing so much and changing and learning and evolving so much that there\u2019s a strong chance that whoever i marry in two years, i won\u2019t get along with in ten, because i\u2019ve grown so much, or, i\u2019ve outgrown them", "that could happen", "or, they could outgrow me", "who knows", "hopefully i marry the kind of person who would outgrow me, someone who is better than i am", "so, anyway, i feel like i might be rambling", "but i do think that \u2013 i hope this doesn\u2019t come off too psychopathic \u2013 that being in a good marriage can be very productive and conducive to professional success because stability, finding stability in other parts of my life is energizing and calming, and the last thing you need if you\u2019re trying to take over the world or start a business or write a book or start an app is to be having petty arguments with an immature person all day", "you know, it would be ridiculous that we spend all this time on life hacks and conserving our energy and four-hour body and

multiple dogs in her house", "do they ever fight, and if so, how does she handle it", " dog people", "i know that tim just got a dog, so, maybe you guys are all dog training information-ed out", "but if you have dogs, i highly recommend them", "they\u2019re very therapeutic", "they\u2019re energizing", "they have taught me a tremendous amount about discipline, helped with my codependent recovery, because you can\u2019t be codependent and train a dog, especially not a really big, strong dog", "i have pit bulls that are just kind of walking lawsuits because everyone is just so litigious these days, and you have to have incredibly well-trained dogs if they\u2019re stronger than you, which mine are", "discipline training with a dog is, i think, great practice for being a boss, for running a company, for being an artist, for being in a healthy relationship, healthy marriage, if you will, if i didn\u2019t just completely talk you out of getting married", "introducing dogs", "a couple of things", "know the dog", "if it\u2019s a rescue, which i highly encourage, know the dog\u2019s triggers", "spend some time with the dog alone first", "don\u2019t introduce them right away", "if you have a dog that already lives in your home, do not just bring the new dog in", "dogs are incredibly territorial, especially if it\u2019s a female", "i would also say make sure you spay and neuter your dogs, always", "makes them more confrontational and aggressive if a dog is not neutered", "it makes the dog \u2013 puts the dog in danger, because it makes other dogs threatened by them", "spay and neuter your dogs", "please", "that is going to greatly reduce the chances that they\u2019re going to get in an altercation or get attacked or attack", "first things first, take all \u2013 if

with each other if you\u2019re the alpha and if they respect you", "i\u2019m going to try to make this shorter, because i could talk about this forever", "yeah, i would say just be the alpha", "if any dogs show aggression, i instantly put them down on the ground and hold them by their front and back legs, hold them down until they exhale and have acquiesced to you being dominant", "if you know your dog well, i would, you know, i bite them on the back of the neck and emulate being the alpha dog", "it\u2019s very weird to watch and not sexy", "i try to only do it in private", "those things work for me", "i have submissive dogs", "i\u2019ve had them since puppies", "i have been in experiences with dogs that are not submissive who i have not had since they were puppies", "that is much harder",

us, but they also want to protect us, and that can be confusing to dogs and can often cause fights", "so, if your dog is fighting, probably is just trying to protect you or thinks you want it to",

a great documentary called buck that i highly recommend, about the horse whisperer guy, and he talks about training horses", "or, it\u2019s a documentary on him training horses", "and essentially

know that much about pit bulls, and she was going to get really big, and there\u2019s so much propaganda and myths about pit bulls", "but, they do have, you know, a row of great white shark teeth, and

i\u2019m here to meet you", "i was like, what", "i mean, the first training session she was training me, because any problems that you have psychologically your dog is going to have", "if you\u2019re impatient, your dog\u2019s going to be impatient", "if you have anger issues, your dog is going to have anger issues", "if you have anxiety, your dog is going to have anxiety", "they\u2019re very empathic", "and they mirror their owners", "so, if you\u2019ve got an issue with your dog, you might want to look in the mirror", "i\u2019ve had to do that many times", "it\u2019s painful, it\u2019s frustrating", "but training my dogs has been one of the most growth-inducing edification experiences of my life because if you\u2019re a dangerous person, you\u2019re going to have a dangerous dog", "and it\u2019s really powerful", "really poignant", "and really frustrating", "and lots of crying and lots of anger", "but it really made me realize how outrageously inappropriate my expectations were for other people as well as dogs", "you get a dog and you\u2019re like, why aren\u2019t you doing what i want you to do", "why would they", "you haven\u2019t told them", "you know, it teaches \u2013 taught me how to set boundaries, how to have realistic expectations, to ask for what i need, to enforce my boundaries, to be consistent", "you can\u2019t be inconsistent with a dog", "if you say no to going on the couch five times but you let them go on the sixth time, dogs are gamblers", "they\u2019re always going to try to play for that one time that they won", "so, you have to be consistent, which is a skill", "you can\u2019t be lazy", "you can\u2019t cut corners", "so, you know, training dogs, i think, is a metaphor for life and for work, relationships, all of it", "it\u2019s powerful",

probably going to be polarizing", "purebred dogs, i think that there\u2019s too much breeding and inbreeding", "i have more luck with mutts", "in my experience, they tend to be a little bit healthier", "this is a total judgement and not a real statistic", "this is just what i\u2019ve seen", "is that this pure-breeding dogs, they tend to be a little more intractable", "i\u2019ve seen some things go wrong, i guess is what i will say", "so, my other little piece of propaganda, i think you guys probably know by this point, that i\u2019m super into dog rescue and adoption", "so, if you don\u2019t have a dog, my recommendation is adopt them", "i find that mixed dogs \u2013 i\u2019ve had a little more luck with them", "okay, dave ware asks: ways to maintain creative energy during overwhelming workload", " great question", "you know, i am a sort of type-a workaholic, and until very recently, i did not know how to maintain my creative energy", "i was, you know, like the horse boxer from animal farm", "i just thought, keep working and keep working and white-knuckle through it", "and i don\u2019t live that way anymore", "if you\u2019re having writer\u2019s block, business

child", "inner child", "sounds weird, i know", "if you do relate to codependency at all, or think you grew up in some kind of dysfunctional home, the big book of adult children of alcoholics, there is \u2013 i don\u2019t know the page number, but there is a description of inner child work, which is all about nurturing your inner child", "i do believe that we\u2019re all just five-year-olds who happen to be very tall and have nice clothes and cars", "but i believe that we\u2019re all essentially five years old, and we forget that sometimes", "and i feel like i\u2019ve spent, you know, a lot of money and time trying to get back to my five-year-old self who was focused on play and creativity and the sky was the limit and colored outside the box, you know", "i\u2019m not slamming our education system, but i think we go through this conforming process in school where we\u2019re taught what to think, not how to think", "and then we get out of college, and we made all the grades and developed discipline and maybe developed an adderall addiction, but we\u2019re robots", "and then all of a sudden, the most successful people are always the most creative ones, not the robot zombies

yellow and the sky blue, i made the cab blue and the sky yellow, trying to work the part of my brain of thinking outside the box", "and that\u2019s a muscle to me", "and that\u2019s something that i

dominated by men", " i don\u2019t know", "chris, you seem really nice, but i feel like i\u2019ve answered the question for ten years, and i still don\u2019t have a good answer", "i guess what i would say is, i don\u2019t think about it", "i see a lot of really powerful, awesome, strong women in this business", "i love men, too, so, all the men i work with are awesome for the most part", "but i do think that, you know, know yourself", "if men are triggering to you because you grew up in a home where, you know, you\u2019ve got dad issues, figure it out", "it used to be more triggering to me", "i guess the most interesting way i can answer this question is, it used to bother me more before i got into therapy and got my shit together", "any issues i had with my dad that made men triggering i healed", "i\u2019m still in the process of healing", "i\u2019m sure there are a lot of wounds i haven\u2019t even gotten to yet that have yet to present themselves to me", "but i would say, you know, i would actual argue that women are even more triggering to me", "i actually had more complicated relationships with women growing up, which is where my codependence gestated", "so, i actually had a harder time working with women in the beginning", "i had trouble with authority figures", "women triggered a me feeling like, you know, without getting too specific about my family of origin, you know, my mother, i felt like i had to walk on eggshells around my mom", "she was a very sensitive person", "and she worked really hard", "she had a day job, which i really respect and admire about her", "she is a really big part of my work ethic", "but she was working a full-time job, raising two kids in an acrimonious marriage, going through a divorce later, balancing a codependent overwhelming social life, and being a mom and cooking and cleaning and all of it", "and she had a lot on her plate", "and as a result, i found that it was hard for me to get attention", "i didn\u2019t want to add stress to her life", "i didn\u2019t want to make things more difficult to her, for her", "and so, i minimized my own needs", "i walked on eggshells", "i tried to anticipate her needs, solve her problems, and i became very obsessed with making sure she was okay", "so, that\u2019s where a lot of my codependence comes from and my preoccupation with other people\u2019s needs", "i project that, or projected that onto people as adults", "but i found that i did it more with women than with men", "but in a professional environment, if i had a female boss or employee, i tend to recreate those circumstances and was very worried that all women were fragile and you had to take care of them, and that they could \u2013 they were going to cry at any second", "and that i couldn\u2019t tell them no", "i couldn\u2019t fire them", "i couldn\u2019t give them notes on a script, they would just fall apart the way i saw as a kid", "so, i guess my answer to this question is figure out your triggers", "if working for a man is hard for you, figure out why", "you know, your boss is not your dad, and your boss is not your mom", "your boyfriend is not your dad", "your husband is not your mom", "you know, figure out what you\u2019re projecting onto people that\u2019s getting in your way", "figure out what old baggage you\u2019re bringing into a current situation, because a lot of times we have \u2013 we don\u2019t have a right-sized reaction to a situation", "if something hurts your feelings too much in a workplace environment, it\u2019s probably not about your workplace environment", "there\u2019s something else going on that you need to fix that has nothing to do with work", "and that\u2019s draining, and it\u2019s old, old stuff that you need to heal",

like, i\u2019m kind of at the point where gender is not \u2013 you know, i don\u2019t really think about it", "i know a lot of men with a lot of traditionally stereotypically female qualities, which is awesome, and i know a lot of women with a lot of traditionally stereotypical masculine qualities", "you know, a lot of people think i have a lot of masculine qualities, at least in my work environment", "certainly not in my personal life.", "but yeah, so, i don\u2019t know", "i don\u2019t say, like, i need to hire a man for this job, or, i need to hire a woman for this job", "you know,

question is to you guys", "i guess i would say, you know, for anyone who wants to be in entertainment, i mean, the internet is totally different now", "you know, this makes me feel very old, but when i started, you know, youtube, people weren\u2019t getting famous off of youtube", "i guess if i were to start now, i\u2019d want to do it the right way", "i\u2019d want to get good", "i\u2019m glad that i started right before people were getting famous off youtube, because i had to work for it", "i went on the road and i got good", "i got really good advice from gary shandling once, the late

american capitalism, maybe it\u2019s my type-a ambition, i don\u2019t know \u2013 but i thought that i had to get success fast", "it was all about being as quick as possible", "and so, if i were to do it over again, i would have done it slower", "i think that i got things a little too fast for a myriad of reasons", "one was me wanting it fast", "you know, i did need money", "i was broke", "so, i did need to get income quickly", "but in terms of getting exposure quickly, standup quicker is very rarely better", "you know, it\u2019s like being a bodybuilder, an athlete", "you know, that\u2019s probably a bad example, because most athletes are very young", "but, you know, you have to get good first", "if you get exposure before you\u2019re good, it only hurts you, especially with the internet now, because you can\u2019t have a bad set and have it disappear", "it\u2019s online forever and will haunt you", "so, i guess what i would say is faster is not necessarily better", "that\u2019s all i will say on that", "in terms of having, you know, staff and hiring people, i would have asked for help", "you know, i think i made a lot of mistakes pretending i knew more than i

therapy", "i mean, there\u2019s ways \u2013 you know, 12-step meetings are free", "it\u2019s free medicine", "these days, there\u2019s no excuse", "you can go online, there are therapists that give

game changer, because this is so embarrassing to admit \u2013 people were triggering for me", "i mean, i was the person who would go to therapists and lie and cajole them and try to make them laugh

encouraging everybody to try it", "horse \u2013 i grew up around horses, so, i already felt safe and a kinship with them", "but, you know, horses are prey animals, so, they are incredibly in tuned

been a bulletproof way to work the muscle of being present and shedding all of my what in a 12-step program we call character defects, which sounds negative, but it\u2019s really just kind of all of

way", "this is chief", "chief was a work horse and no one ever paid attention to him", "this is so-and-so, he was abused by this person", "and she then \u2013 whatever their backstory is", "and then she says, which one would you like to work with today", "and the one that you choose already is like a rorschach test", "it already says everything about you, what you\u2019re attracted to, right",

hour, which is my nightmare, because it feels so unproductive, and i drove all the way out here, and i\u2019m just sitting in a corral, and i\u2019m not even getting instagram photos out of it, and i need to take a selfie for snapchat to get followers, you know", "it\u2019s just \u2013 you know, it\u2019s like our hyperactive, you know, productivity-obsessed brains", "and when i\u2019m thinking positive thoughts \u2013 this sounds so hippy \u2013 but when i\u2019m thinking positive thoughts and am full of gratitude, the horse, chief, will come up to me and hang out with me, and i\u2019ll be petting him, and we\u2019ll be having kind of this amazing moment", "and then of course, the negative thoughts creep in, and i\u2019m like, i should be working harder", "i need to go home", "i need to do this and this and this this week, da, da, da, da", "and i\u2019m falling behind, and i\u2019m never going to make it", "blah blah blah", "and the horse will just walk to the other side of the corral", "she wants nothing to do with my negativity", "and cassandra will just be like, what\u2019s going on", "what just happened", "and i\u2019m like, my inner monologue just started screaming bloody murder", "so, it\u2019s kind of an immediate way to ascertain your negativity", "horses are just really attuned to it, and they don\u2019t like it", "most animals don\u2019t", "but it also

get the employees you want, you\u2019re not going to get the boyfriend you want or the wife you want or the investor that you want", "you know, i think for the most part maybe i\u2019m wrong", "people tend to invest in higher and work with people that have good energy, that they want to be around", "you know, most of \u2013 if you work at a job \u2013 we spend more time with people we work with than our spouses, right", "so, you know, i think that it\u2019s really important that if you want to accomplish your goals, you need to have good energy and be the kind of person that someone wants to be around that\u2019s not like, negative and depleting", "you know when someone just has bad energy", "it\u2019s toxic, and it suffocates a creative environment", "it\u2019s exhausting", "and, you know, for me, it took \u2013 therapists could not do it for me", "i had to go to horses first in order to get some self-awareness", "so, that\u2019s that", "if you don\u2019t live in california, which

that", "there\u2019s a book called the tools by phil stutz and barry michels maybe", "this book i\u2019m going to just, full disclosure, i think it\u2019s a little amateur in places", "i\u2019m a big fan of phil stutz", "he did a great podcast with marc maron", "he\u2019s sort of a gangster old-school therapist in l.a", "i\u2019ve never met him", "he has very fancy sort of people", "but super cool dude", "and they wrote a book called the tools", "and it\u2019s all of the devices i guess you would call it, tools, that they have developed to help people get through blocks and have breakthroughs", "for example, they have one that\u2019s called reversal of desire where if you\u2019re afraid of something, the best way to get over the fear is to start to crave what you fear", "pretty fascinating", "to basically live the worst-case scenario of your fear", "so, if your worst fear is getting fired, for example, or losing your money, or whatever it is, or not getting that job, or not selling your app or whatever it is, you essentially have to live through what that would be like", "you know, it\u2019s kind of like, jumping through a glass wall", "the hardest part is just getting through it, and then you realize you\u2019re going to survive whatever it is", "that\u2019s probably a terrible way of explaining it", "and another one is, i think it\u2019s called deathbed where when you\u2019re having trouble making a decision, you imagine and visualize yourself on your deathbed and basically what you\u2019re going to regret and not regret and what decision you wish you had made",

don\u2019t remember", "but it has all these little anecdotes and stories that kind of bored me as a type-a person who just wants the solution now", "but i highly recommend that book", "let\u2019s see", "i wrote some other stuff down that i think is probably \u2013 we\u2019ve covered", "there\u2019s a great book called sapiens", "a book by yuval noah harari", "i hope i\u2019m not mispronouncing that", "you know, that really helped me, because i think that knowing about your neurology, all of our neurology and sort of our primitive chemical reactions is very liberating in order to, not change them or harness them, but understand them", "it helps me have patience with myself and other people", "the female brain by louann brizendine", "there\u2019s a male brain as well", "i think that both

about sort of how we\u2019ve evolved and why we have anxiety, you know", "you know, i think anxiety is \u2013 i feel everyone has got anxiety these days", "and i think there are a lot of reasons", "i think a lot of it is our phone, our computer", "you know, our primordial brain apparently, from what i gather", "i\u2019m not a scientist \u2013 thinks that\u2019s the sun", "it\u2019s very adrenalizing", "it makes us release cortisol, which is a stress hormone", "we\u2019re constantly in a bent over position, which i actually on tim\u2019s podcast with gabby reece and laird hamilton, she was talking about how when we\u2019re bent over that\u2019s a defensive posture, when we\u2019re on our computers and on our phones, which is what signals our brain that we\u2019re in trouble and puts us in a fight or flight response", "i think it was in sapiens he talks about how humans are superficially at the top of the food chain", "we don\u2019t deserve to be there", "it\u2019s only because we developed weapons and alarm systems and doors that we\u2019re safe", "but if you put me with a lion in a room without a gun, i\u2019m going to lose", "we\u2019re really at the bottom of the food chain", "i mean, bees can kill us", "that\u2019s how vulnerable we are", "so, there is this anxiety that comes from our subconscious knowing that we\u2019re actually superficially at the top of the food chain and could be killed by a bee at any minute", "i don\u2019t know", "you know, take what you like, and leave the rest, if any of that is helpful to you", "and the question was, oh, other therapy", "yeah, so, for me also, learning about neurology has been a type of therapy for me to help me to be more productive, to be more patient, less anxious, or when i am anxious to have a better understanding why", "ten, question ten", "zack edward dolan wants to know: i want to do standup in addition to my normal day job, but open mic night is only three minutes per performer at our local

wait around three hours to go up for three minutes", "what i would say is that although that sounds like a, you know, a comically small amount of time, the first couple of years you\u2019re doing

to be in your netflix special in five years when you do make it", "you know, i don\u2019t even remember the material i was doing the first couple of years", "the material\u2019s just an excuse to get on stage and get comfortable in front of drunk strangers in a very weird, creepy, seedy environment", "if you get on stage and you already feel comfortable, congratulations", "you have had something terrible happen to you that that is your comfort zone", "but most people don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to strangers", "public speaking i think is one of the biggest fears, if not the biggest

easy", "but it is worth it if this is really your passion", "another suggestion i have is start your own show", "that\u2019s something that i did when i started, because i was frustrated by not getting stage time, because number one, i wasn\u2019t good", "no one was going to give me stage time", "i didn\u2019t deserve it yet", "and the places that i could, the open mics were only three minutes", "so, i started my own show, which is a way to give other comics time, but also to ensure every week that you\u2019re going to have stage time", "so, i hosted a show", "it was a lot of work",

standup for the comics that are coming that want stage time themselves", "if you can make a comic laugh, you\u2019re in good shape", "so, that\u2019s actually pretty good practice", "and you know, so,

it\u2019s 2017, and you could also start like a funny twitter feed to try jokes out", "it\u2019s obviously a very different kind of reaction", "it\u2019s not an involuntary laugh", "but, you know, rob

know, marianne williamson oprah \u2013 but liking yourself is way more likeable than needing people to like you, if that makes any sense", "maybe it doesn\u2019t", "you know, and it also helped me to understand neurology and codependence and all this stuff, because i was able to develop the skill of detachment because i realized that whether people liked me or not, or what someone\u2019s reaction to me is a lot of times has nothing to do with me, because they could be projecting all their own stuff onto me", "i\u2019ve already said that", "i\u2019m saying it again in a different way", "but that was a little bit of a cheat for me, and i stopped thinking about it and obsessing about it so much because it\u2019s out of my control", "obsessing about something you can\u2019t control is a form of insanity", "something that i feel like might be good advice that a guy named byron allen gave me this advice", "i don\u2019t know if you know byron allen", "he i think was the youngest person to ever host the tonight show", "i don\u2019t need to give you statistics", "you can google him, you\u2019re an adult", "but he\u2019s got a lot of shows", "he randomly has syndicated shows on local networks that come on at sort of two in the morning", "i don\u2019t \u2013 i just know because i get tweets of a show i hosted of his eight years ago that\u2019s still running in random markets at four a.m", "very embarrassing", "sorry about my haircut", "weird bangs back then", "but he is incredibly successful", "and one time he called me into his office to talk about something, and he gave me really great advice, which was, don\u2019t worry about getting new fans", "just satisfy the fans that you already have", "which was like, blindsided me, because i thought it was get as many people to like you as possible", "his thing is more, be loyal to the people who already support you instead of hording a bunch of people who kind of like you", "getting a tribe of \u2013 and now i\u2019m improvising", "this isn\u2019t all what he said", "but what i would say is find your tribe of people who really get you and honor them, because if you start trying to please everybody, you please nobody", "i\u2019m plagiarizing that from someone, obviously", "we\u2019ve heard that a million times", "but you know, you\u2019ll never make everyone like you", "it\u2019s not going to happen, unless you\u2019re beyonc\u00e9", "so, don\u2019t bother", "and in terms of the hack thing, you know, i guess what i would say is for the most part, usually when people call you a hack, it\u2019s a compliment, because it just means you\u2019re really popular", "[you know, something happens in the entertainment business where if you get too much success, people all of a sudden think you suck, which i think is kind of funny, because no other field does that happen", "no one\u2019s like, this george foreman grill must suck, because everyone has one", "this is sort of anathema to logic", "but you know, i think that also understanding that humans have a sort of \u2013 we are predisposed to have kind of a primordial need to judge and be negative", "i think it\u2019s just our tribal us against them", "it\u2019s why if you\u2019re a redskins fan you hate dallas", "it\u2019s why if you\u2019re a stern fan you hate opie and anthony, or vice versa", "i think we have a predisposition to be us versus them", "so, you know, when people want to pit me against other female comedians or podcasters against podcasters or compare, it\u2019s a natural human nature thing that i try not to take too personally", "i\u2019m just grateful to be in the ring and being able to do what i love", "so, i just try to stay in gratitude, because for my personality, that\u2019s the only place that i can find sanity", "and if someone is judging me to feel better about themselves, i want to send them compassion, because i do that, and when i do it, it usually means i feel insufficient or jealous or insecure", "so, but that\u2019s just me", "maybe i\u2019m being delusional", "but guess what", "it\u2019s working", "anyway, so, byron\u2019s thing", "you know, he also had this \u2013 he said in order to be like a huge success, you really only need about a million people to like you", "he was pointing out a really successful comedian who was like a household name at the time, and you know, making a million dollars a night selling out these huge arenas, and he did the math on how many people were seeing his shows", "i\u2019m awful at math, so, i\u2019m not going to pretend i know how to do this", "but he kind of broke it down for me, and he was like, you know, 20,000 seats \u2013 if you\u2019re selling 20,000 seats a night times 50 cities and you know, selling $60.00 tickets, you know, you really only need a million people out of 380 million people in america", "so, you don\u2019t even need one percent of people to know who you are in order to be a household name and really successful", "so, stop trying to get ten million", "just don\u2019t lose the one million who like you by selling out trying to get the other 300 million", "i thought that was good advice", "jamie leblanc-sur", "leblanc-sur", "are you french", "i hope so", "given the cons of each facet, what keeps her motivated, and which is her favorite", "writing, standup, acting, etcetera", " i don\u2019t know", "i believe in order to be good at one thing you have to do a lot of things", "maybe that\u2019s just how my brain works", "i get bored, and i think that all of these things reinforce each other", "i think in order to be a good boss, you need to know what it\u2019s like to be an employee", "i think in order to, you know, sell an app you have to know what it\u2019s like to need that app", "you have to get into the head of, you know, your consumer or your \u2013 you know, i think in order to be a good standup, you have to know what it\u2019s like to be in the audience, you know", "i\u2019ll go see standup shows as a patron, you know", "i think it\u2019s important", "i recently directed a movie, and it made me a better actor", "how weird is that", "because i learned about, you know, continuity", "like, when you\u2019re acting and you\u2019re picking up props and stuff, you have to do it the same way every time or else in editing we can\u2019t cut it together", "so, if an actor has bad continuity, like for example, on each line, they\u2019re supposed to pick up the coffee cup at the same time", "if they pick it up at a different time each take, we can\u2019t edit them together", "so, they may have a brilliant performance, but they picked up the coffee cup at the wrong time, so, i can\u2019t use it", "so, i\u2019ve done jobs before where i\u2019m like, why did they use that take", "that wasn\u2019t my best take", "that wasn\u2019t my best performance", "how dare they", "but i probably made a continuity mistake, which rendered my good take useless", "so, i think for me, being a writer, being an actor, being a standup, being a writer and director makes me better at everything", "i also think it\u2019s a skill to know what belongs where", "so, if you\u2019re a writer, for example, or creative person, you know, i had a lot of sort of stories that weren\u2019t funny enough to be in standup, but i\u2019m trying to make it a standup joke, and i realize, oh, this is a movie idea", "this isn\u2019t a standup joke", "or, this should be in a book", "or, i\u2019m writing a book right now, and i\u2019m like, this should be a standup joke", "i\u2019m not going to put this \u2013 you know", "it\u2019s too jokey to put in a chapter", "it feels desperate", "i should do this on stage", "you know", "so, i think having a lot of different outlets is good", "you know, if you\u2019re a really creative person and you have a podcast and you have a blog and you have an app and you have a book, you know, knowing what goes where i think is a strong skill to have", "one that i\u2019m still honing", "but i kind of like all of it, because i think, you know, it\u2019s like going to the gym", "you have to do legs, arms", "i don\u2019t go to the gym that much, obviously", "but you\u2019ve got to do every part of the body", "i also think you\u2019ve got to work every part of the brain", "anyway", "that\u2019s that", "i hope that made some sense", "standup, however, is probably my favorite thing to do", "it\u2019s the most thrilling", "it\u2019s like walking on a tightrope", "i think everyone should do it, even if, you know, i hope tim decides to jump off that cliff at some point", "i think that standup is like skydiving or something", "i think everyone should do it at some point", "actually, i take that back", "i don\u2019t think anyone should skydive", "i think it\u2019s ridiculous", "i\u2019ve never done it, never plan on doing it", "i\u2019m just saying the feel of standup is that thrilling, and i think you really find out who you are when you do standup", "it\u2019s a truth serum", "and i think everyone should do it at least once just to try it as a life experience", "i highly encourage it", "but it makes me feel very awake, alive", "it makes me tell the truth, because the audience only responds to the truth", "and as somebody who, you know, as a performer, sometimes i want to perform, and the audience doesn\u2019t let you", "the audience is a litmus test in a lot of ways, and like horses, forces you to be honest", "and as someone who, you know, as a kid developed the skill of being dishonest in order to be liked and to maintain equilibrium in a hectic home, i need that", "i need a reminder to be honest all the time, which sounds sad and dark", "but i think a lot of us are taught as kids, man up", "don\u2019t cry", "it\u2019s fine", "calm down", "and you know, we are constantly inculcated with those messages as children, and as a result, i think a lot of us develop these \u2013 we pretend", "we pretend we\u2019re fine when we\u2019re not", "we pretend things are funny when we\u2019re not laughing", "we pretend to be interested in boring conversations", "we lie all day, every day, and it\u2019s exhausting", "so, i am trying to deactivate that superpower, which worked really well as a kid, because i got good grades, and my parents, i didn\u2019t get grounded, and i got into a college because of all of this sort of pretending i was fine and pretending i was this and that", "and pretending is draining and unoriginal, and it feels like you\u2019re sleepwalking through life and acting through life", "this is getting very personal, isn\u2019t it", "next one", "jen bales says: what steps or advice would she give someone who wants to get their tv script in front of the right people", "how do you get people to read your work, especially for those who aren\u2019t living in l.a.", "jen, i don\u2019t know", "i felt like i needed to include a question with an answer i didn\u2019t know the answer to, because i\u2019m sure a lot of people have that question", "i am sorry to say this, but i do think you have to live in l.a", "or new york and hustle", "you know, i started doing standup, and i became a writer on a late-night show and started writing scripts, and i had a manager who \u2013 you know, i kind of \u2013 i had an oblique angle", "i mean, i was doing standup", "but i don\u2019t know how people do that", "i have to be really honest with you", "i don\u2019t think you can just blind send it to agencies", "i would say get \u2013 what i see success in now is people having successful funny twitter feeds, successful youtube videos, blogs, podcasts", "they come out to l.a", "or new york", "they do shows at comedy clubs in ucb and, you know, that\u2019s how it happens", "you know, there\u2019s chicago, there\u2019s portland has a comedy scene", "denver has a big comedy", "you know, i do think you might have to be in a metropolitan city", "so, as annoying and as expensive as that sounds, i do think that that\u2019s a big part of it", "from what i have seen statistically, that seems to be what works", "but i would say you can\u2019t have someone read your script until you write it, so, write a script, read scripts, watch episodes of great shows", "cheers, mad about you, pilot", "watch great shows", "watch shows that you like", "write specs for those shows", "a spec is an example, like, an episode of a show that you\u2019d want to write for", "you can write a spec for the office, for example", "you\u2019re not going to get a job on the office, because it\u2019s not on anymore, but people then read that spec, and they go, oh, this person can write for this show", "they can write for \u2013 they have a voice", "but they also can conform to the voice of a show they didn\u2019t create", "so, if i\u2019m hiring a tv writer, i read a spec script", "they write a spec for how i met your mother, or modern family, or whatever it is", "you cannot submit a spec to a show that is the show", "so, if you want to write on 2 broke girls, i can\u2019t read a 2 broke girls spec, because it\u2019s a legal nightmare, and you\u2019ll sue me, and, you know", "it\u2019s happened, and continues to happen", "so, if you want to write for big bang theory, don\u2019t write a big bang theory spec", "write a mike & molly spec, or something else that\u2019s currently on", "and try to get it to an agent and get to a metropolitan city, as savage and cold-blooded as that sounds", "okay, we have to wrap this up soon", "i feel like this is going on really long", "addy seagull: where do most of your ideas and jokes come from", "do they jump to your mind while you\u2019re doing other things", "shower, gym, etcetera, or is there a specific thinking process", " a little bit of both", "you know, again, i think you have to be relentless in your pursuit of inspiration", "i read the news every morning", "i read books", "you know, i ask people questions", "i\u2019m really annoying to have dinner with, because all i do is ask questions about your personal life and your sex life and your \u2013 do you believe in religion, and who are you, trying to mine for jokes and spark of something", "or, i\u2019m always kind of subconsciously or consciously building a case for material i have", "so, if i decide, you know, a thesis of \u2013 which i mentioned earlier, which again, i believe sounds slightly mentally ill \u2013 that married people are more successful", "happily married, let\u2019s say that", "but people in stable relationships", "if i\u2019m with a successful person, i\u2019ll ask them about their marriage and how is it and do you fight and what do you fight about and how often do you fight and do they support your career", "i\u2019m building a case, trying to \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 being a comedian, for me at least, is kind of like being a scientist", "you have to come up with \u2013 chris rock said this", "that you have to come up with a ridiculous theory and then prove it", "so, you know, for example, cars are like women", "ridiculous theory", "right", "that\u2019s not that ridiculous, but you know what i mean", "something no one\u2019s ever heard before, like a big comparison or simile", "cars are like women", "and then you prove it", "the jokes, you have to get a new one every three years", "they come in six colors", "whatever the funny proof is, right", "they lose their value as soon as you take them off the lot", "etcetera, etcetera", "insert funny joke here", "so, i guess

that\u2019s \u2013 you know, neil brennan, i just feel the need to credit everybody i\u2019m quoting \u2013 says, you know, comedians are obsessed with justice", "i think that\u2019s true", "louis c.k", "says if you think about something more than three times a week, you need to write a joke about it", "so, that\u2019s that", "let\u2019s see", "oh, i also would like to say that in the first podcast i did with tim, i feel like i want to do a redo on my billboard, when he says, if you could have a billboard anywhere, what would it say", "i don\u2019t remember what i said, but i remember panicking", "i listen to tim\u2019s show, but i remember being like, i\u2019m not going to listen", "i\u2019m just going to go on, and i\u2019m going to be authentic, and i\u2019m just going to tell my truth and channel whatever the viewers need to hear", "and then i got on there, and i was like, i should have prepared for this, because the billboard question really stumped me, and i felt very dumb and like i bombed it", "and i now have a better answer that i would like to say, which is i\u2019m plagiarizing from peter burg, the director who is, you know, brilliant man", "he did friday

something that was \u2013 that i needed to hear, because i think anyone listening to this podcast, myself included, i want to do so many things", "i have so many ideas", "anyone can have ideas", "but the ones that succeed are the ones that execute and push it across the finish line", "and for me, those last three steps, that last sprint, is always the hardest for me, because i\u2019m tired and i
