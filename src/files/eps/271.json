This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I am sitting, listening to people whack mitts and banana bags, and I\u2019m imagining doing Muay Thai while I have positioned myself in what\u2019s known as the \u201ccat room\u201d \u2013 meow! \u2013 with red padding over all the walls at Onnit headquarters here in Austin, Texas. Check out Onnit.com \u2013 not a paid mention, just a thank you and hat tip to Mr. Aubrey. Thank you, sir, for lending me your space for recording. This episode is a much-requested follow-up with Esther Perel, @EstherPerel, E-S-T-H-E-R P-E-R-E-L, on Twitter, who has been called the most important game changer in sexuality and relational health since Dr. Ruth. And, since I first met Esther, I\u2019ve spent more and more time with her, and the more time I spend with her, the more impressed I am. She is the real deal, and very insightful. Her TED Talks on maintaining desire and rethinking infidelity probably have more than 20 million views at this point, and she has both seen and tested everything imaginable firsthand in 34 years of running her private therapy practice in New York City. Esther is the author of the international bestseller Mating in Captivity \u2013 you\u2019ve probably heard of it \u2013 which has been translated into 26 languages. She is fluent in nine of those languages. I\u2019ve heard her use them in person. As a Belgian native, she now brings her multicultural pulse to a new book, which I highly recommend checking out \u2013 The State of Affairs, subtitle Rethinking Infidelity. Her creative energy is currently also focused on the creation and hosting of an Audible original audio series, Where Should We Begin?, but The State of Affairs is worth checking out. In this episode, Esther answers your most upvoted questions, including how to foster relationship or marriage longevity, the most effective ways to improve communication in relationships, how to deal with criticism, letting go of emotional baggage from past relationships, how to know when to move on from a relationship that just doesn\u2019t seem to be working, and much, much more. If you like Esther, you\u2019re going to love this, and her episode is one of the most downloaded of all time previously, so here is more of the good stuff. Please enjoy this wildly interesting \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 Q&A from your questions with Esther Perel. Esther Perel: Hi. I\u2019m Esther Perel. Thanks for sending in your thoughts and questions. Let\u2019s dive in. So, this is a question from Gregoire Frifri via Facebook. \u201cI would love to ask her how to foster marriage longevity. Any exercises, routines, or habits would be great, especially around fostering deeper emotional relationships.\u201d That is the first basic \u2013 appreciation. Simply saying a lot of nice things, not taking things for granted, not forgetting to say please and thank you just because it\u2019s the person that you live with, making compliments, holding hands, kissing, stroking, sending sweet notes, buying flowers, preparing breakfast, bringing the coffee to bed \u2013 all those sweet things that people do that basically let you know that they live inside of you, that you\u2019re thinking of them even when they\u2019re not there. These daily appreciations go a long way, and sometimes, it\u2019s a real diligent effort to keep doing them. And then, I am a strong fan of letter writing. I think that when you fly away, when you\u2019re away, sitting in a caf\u00e9 when you just have a moment, drop a note that\u2019s not just on the birthdays and on the anniversaries, but your own musings about you, your lives together, your dreams, where you\u2019re going, how you met, what you remember, what you fancy \u2013 that is very much the telling of the story of the couple. There\u2019s a lot of intimacy in there. Touch is a major experience of intimacy. I think when you do that, humor, and things that encourage the other person in which you recognize them at their most authentic \u2013 go do this thing. This is similar to something you really like. Take a few more days. \u201cYou always wanted to take this class \u2013 go take this class.\u201d These are ways in which you encourage the other person to be the best version of themselves, and vice versa. Be your best version of yourself with them. The things that are really basic are what makes a relationship sustain itself and be more nurturing. Next, Alicia Kinea Eidelberger asks via Facebook, \u201cHow do you lessen arguments in your marriage?\u201d Look: I think it\u2019s all about the art of speaking and listening. Now, there was a sculpture a few years back by Bruce Nauman, and it was a World Peace product. He had 23-inch monitors with faces of the most diverse group of people \u2013 diverse races, ethnicities, genders, ages, all of it \u2013 and every single person \u2013 every face was saying, \u201cI\u2019ll talk, and you listen. You\u2019ll talk, and I\u2019ll listen. They\u2019ll talk, and we listen. You\u2019ll talk, and we listen.\u201d And, it just showed you the robustness of this most difficult art, which is often harder than speaking, I would say. But, to some people, speaking may be the hardest thing. In a relationship, you can often get the daily hassles in which you are grinding at each other, and in which there\u2019s a friction going on. Don\u2019t sweat the small things. That\u2019s probably really important in terms of how people deal with arguments in a relationship. I would say don\u2019t complain, ask. Behind every criticism, there\u2019s often a wish. If you believe that your partner has done something wrong \u2013 that they didn\u2019t pay a bill on time or anything \u2013 and you wish that they had done it right, instead of acting them to correct it, you basically tell them they can never do it well, that they\u2019re doing this on purpose \u2013 just ask them to do it better next time. Rather than \u201cWould it kill you?\u201d, something as simple as, \u201cDo you think that next time, you could set a monthly alert so that you don\u2019t forget?\u201d It\u2019s a very different tone. It\u2019s a very different way of relating to the person. There\u2019s no contempt in that one. We know from the research of John Guthman that contempt is one of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. Actually, I\u2019m going to give you the four horses because they\u2019re really important. They are criticism, contempt, stonewalling, and defensiveness. Those four are pretty much the killers in the land of arguments and relationship decline. Try not to talk with categoricals of always and never, all or nothing. That is probably one of the most important changes in vocabulary. Banish them. \u201cI always have to ask you.\u201d \u201cYou never do this.\u201d The moment you say, \u201cYou never,\u201d the other person is going to come up with the one time that they know and that they\u2019ve done it, so that they can defeat your argument rather than understand that you\u2019re asking them to do it more often, which is exactly why I say, \u201cAsk, don\u2019t complain.\u201d Add some humor. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to defuse your arguments more than just putting some perspective into it and not taking yourself so seriously. Show empathy. At the end of the day, assume that your partner has the same interests as you \u2013 to solve the stresses in your relationship. For that to happen, it\u2019s important that both of you understand and appreciate the other person\u2019s point of view. Do you really think the other person wants you to purposefully be annoyed, hurt you, or let you down? Probably not. It\u2019s all of that shift that takes you out of relationships that are mired in bickering, chronic low-intensity warfare, or high conflict. There\u2019s a range there. Imagine I ask you, \u201cHas your arguing turned toxic?\u201d Does your partner keep telling you that you can never do it right, or that they can never do it right by you, that every little conversation about who should set the table will end up in a blowout about how dysfunctional your relationship is, or that two minutes into a fight, one of you is saying you should get a divorce or break up? That\u2019s what I\u2019m calling a high-conflict couple. The opposite of the argument is coming in and saying, \u201cI want to listen to what you have to say. I want to apologize. What can I do to make this better?\u201d Not \u201cWhat can you do to make this better?\u201d Shift it around, and you\u2019ll have magic happening. Next, we have a question from Ben Altman about jealousy. \u201cThe majority of non-exclusive relationships I\u2019ve seen seem to get done in by one of two parties: Feeling possessive. How do we rid ourselves from these negative emotions?\u201d Ben, I think that jealousy is intrinsic to love. I don\u2019t think of it as a negative emotion. It is part and parcel of the experience. I think that sometimes, it\u2019s an interesting experience, particularly in the U.S., where people will often say, \u201cI\u2019m not jealous because I\u2019m angry,\u201d as if jealousy is a feeling that is politically incorrect. It doesn\u2019t have much popularity these days. Jealousy is an erotic rage. Jealousy is the feeling you have when your partner takes their love, their desire, or their excitement to someone else, and you want it directed toward you. It is thwarted away from you. So, I don\u2019t suggest that you rid yourself of that emotion. I suggest that you integrate the emotion. It tells you something. It generates action. It generates conversations. It is not the same as possessiveness. They\u2019re related, but they\u2019re not the same. On the other end, here is a simple formula for possessiveness: If you love someone, set them free. If they love you, they\u2019ll come back. Joseph DiBernardo posted this question on Twitter: \u201cEsther, what is the best way to move on after divorce and deal with post-marriage depression/sadness, especially for men who find it difficult to speak about their inner pain of the divorce and the lack of connection?\u201d Joseph, I\u2019m going to tell you something: Men have a much harder time emotionally and physically post-divorce than women. Maybe not financially, but in every other respect, they do. They suffer much more. They\u2019re more at risk for accidents and drinking. They take a hit because they need women, even though they want to pretend that they don\u2019t. It goes against the cultural narrative. I think that what you have in this moment is two things: 1). You absolutely want to reach out, and I think if you have friends that you could talk to, that would be great \u2013 male or female friends. If you want to go to a men\u2019s retreat, to a men\u2019s group, there is nothing comparable to it at this point than groups where guys come together to talk about their inner life and what\u2019s going on with them. It\u2019s empowering, it builds solidarity, it takes you out of the loneliness, the shame, isolation, and the feeling of failure \u2013 all of it. There\u2019s nothing more powerful than a group of people that come together and hold one person while that person can\u2019t hold themselves. It\u2019s a spiritual challenge; it\u2019s not just a relationship challenge. So, you need to go get energy. You\u2019re depleted. One of the ways that you get energy is by going to do something for others. Go help others. The research is very clear. The most powerful antidepressant is doing for other people. It puts things in perspective. It makes you feel like you have something to offer. It makes you feel appreciated by the people whom you\u2019re helping. It changes the entire equation of what\u2019s going on inside of you. Write. I think journaling is an important part of mourning. On occasion, if it works out, it may be a good thing to have a final conversation with your ex, a bit of time later where you clear things and try to have a different conversation than the ones that you had when things really tanked. I think that it\u2019s also useful, on occasion, to go to your family and ask a little bit about what the history of relationships has been in the family so that you get to learn a little bit as well. What are some of the unknown legacies that you carry inside of you? The main thing is to not isolate yourself. That\u2019s it. You will see that when you start to talk, people generally appreciate it. They don\u2019t know to do it themselves, but they like it when they feel that they have something to offer, when they\u2019re made to feel significant because someone else opens up to them. It\u2019s sometimes the opposite of what we anticipate. Good luck to you. The Real Josh Gill asks on Twitter, \u201cI\u2019d love to hear her talk about letting go, moving past the anger from being cheated on, the anger towards the partner that cheated, the friends that seemingly abandoned the one that was cheated on, and the anger towards the self for not seeing the relationship falling apart sooner, and trying to fix it.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of self-blame here, right? A lot of self-blame and a lot of anger at the other people for not being there for you. Often, when people are cheated on, the first thing is to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? What am I missing? Why am I not enough? Why didn\u2019t I see it?\u201d But sometimes, there is a reason that people engage in trauma denial, that people don\u2019t want to see. When we don\u2019t see, it protects us. It preserves a certain coherence to our life. It\u2019s not just because we are fools, and idiots, and easily duped. So, be careful about not pouring all kinds of self-loathing onto yourself. \u201cWhat kind of an idiot are you? How could you not know it? What kind of a guy lets himself be walked on like this? You should have known, you should have seen, you should have done more.\u201d Ask yourself those questions, but from a place of responsibility, not from a place of beating yourself down and blaming yourself, because then, you can\u2019t think. If you put yourself down that much and you feel so terrible about yourself, you cannot really think. All you can really do is just protect yourself from getting the blows. Now, there are phases in the recovery as well. The first thing is to simply \u2013 the hurt, anger, confusion, disbelief, disorientation, the loss of the predictable future, the idea that whatever you thought your life was going to be isn\u2019t going to happen \u2013 all of that. You need to respect that. All these feelings are going to hit you all at once, and it\u2019s going to be an avalanche of all this maelstrom. That\u2019s normal. It\u2019s in the nature of the beast. It\u2019s really normal. Gradually and occasionally, you will mourn this, and you will think it wasn\u2019t good anyway, and at other times, you will say, \u201cI could have continued this way. How could she destroy all of that?\u201d And then, you can ask your friends. Talk to them. \u201cDid you see things? Did you try to warn me? Did I not listen? Were you equally as surprised as me?\u201d But, you need to know that there are phases of recovery. I\u2019ve written about it extensively in my new book. You go from the crisis, then you go and move into the insight phase where you start to make sense of all of this. \u201cWhy did this happen? What can I learn from this? What does it say about our relationship? What does it say about me? What does it say about her?\u201d And then, there is the \u201cWhere does this take me now? Where are my lessons? Where am I going to go with that?\u201d Try not to have this just become a script for anger and bitterness. I think when you\u2019re very angry all the time, you basically also protect yourself from not being too sad, from not being hurt, from not feeling vulnerable. It kind of props you up to be angry, and it gives you a sense of righteousness, but behind the anger is often a real sense of collapse. Let yourself go there. It\u2019s okay. It really hurts. To just be angry isn\u2019t going to make it for you. How do you allow yourself that? By being with people you trust, next to whom you can fall apart, who won\u2019t judge you for it, who understand heartbreak. It is a human emotion. It\u2019s one of the oldest experiences we\u2019ve had, and it\u2019s part of our humanity. You won\u2019t avoid it. Let yourself feel the pain, the hurt, and the sadness, and cry, and then you\u2019ll come through it. I\u2019m thinking about a guy that I wrote about in my book who \u2013 it was actually the girl that he used to date who cheated on him with his brother, and for years, every time a girl liked him, he thought, \u201cWho else is hiding here that I\u2019m not seeing?\u201d He really carried it with him for a long time. It takes a while until you begin to trust again, until you begin to feel good about yourself again, until you feel that you are able to be loved and lovable. This experience really goes very deep. It taps into our sense of self-worth and all of that. I hope that the stories that I wrote about in the book will help you with that. They were meant for that. They were meant to help you. Thank you. Ranjani86 writes on Twitter, \u201cIs it harder to find true love as you get older and progressively more intelligent? Do you have to be young and stupid to find love? Do most people in search of a partner settle at some point?\u201d I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, but I\u2019m going to challenge the premise of your question a little bit. What does it mean to settle? I think the main thing is this: When you are younger, you allow yourself the experience of meeting someone, seeing where it takes you, unfolding with the story, and embracing the surprise of where this thing is going that you didn\u2019t expect. But, when you\u2019re looking for a relationship as an adult and you come with your expectations, you often thwart the possibility for a story to unfold and surprise you because you\u2019re sitting there with an inventory, and you\u2019re not really allowing for the unknown to open itself up to you and to take you on a ride that you didn\u2019t see coming. I think most of the dating that involves a checklist is doomed. That\u2019s the best way I can say it. It\u2019s anti-romance, it\u2019s anti-story, and stories are the way we live our lives. It\u2019s a list of items. Often, you will find that people match all the items on your list, and the feeling isn\u2019t there because a feeling is something that emerges and develops through interaction, through shared experience, and through the creation of a shared story together. I don\u2019t believe that is any less possible as an adult. In fact, when you are older, you are clearer about what you like and what you resonate with. You know yourself better, and from that place, you are more able to appreciate the person that is in front of you, but it\u2019s not like you have to be young and foolish to fall in love. No, absolutely not. There is no age for it. People fall in love at any age at this point. People have the opportunity for the first time in history to actually start entire new lives in their 50s, 60s, and 70s. Love doesn\u2019t have an age to it. We love differently because we are more mature, because we accept certain things more, and because we accept other things less, and we don\u2019t necessarily call that \u201csettling.\u201d Settling means what? I only found six items out of ten on my list? That\u2019s not the way we do it. We make a choice, and a choice always involves a loss, and at some point, we make certain choices that are more rational or more forward-looking. We understand that there are certain things we need in order to live with someone, and that there are some people with whom we could have a fantastic love affair and a fantastic adventure, but not necessarily build a whole life together. In that sense, we are able to hold more elements at the same time and make a decision that embraces ambivalence. It\u2019s something that I call maturity, not settling. Gavilina asks through Twitter, \u201cWhen, do you know a relationship is done?\u201d That is such a powerful question, but what do we mean by \u201cdone\u201d? That you don\u2019t like who you have become? That you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing? That you don\u2019t like how you\u2019re being reflected back? That the relationship has lost its sense of life and vitality, or that it has become toxic and has dying on the vine? What do we call \u201cdone\u201d? I think the main element that is really the kiss of death, the end of a relationship, is contempt because it really involves a profound sense of dehumanization. When that tone that just says, \u201cLook at you. Come on. What is this? You call this a relationship?\u201d That sense of self-loathing and contempt \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to come back from that. You can fight, you can be critical, you can complain, you can be volatile. You can have a lot of things in a relationship because from there, you can always come back into sweet repair, tender, connecting, et cetera, and you just go through the cycle of connection, disconnection, and repair, which is the triad of relationships. But, contempt is a real tough one \u2013 the belittling, the infantilizing, the demeaning, the degrading \u2013 all these categories of relationships which basically amount to abuse. To me, that is a moment when a relationship really is done, because what it means is that in order to protect oneself, one needs to leave \u2013 unless you\u2019re the one doing it, and then, in order to protect yourself and the other, you need to change. Thank you. Kelsey Halman asks on Facebook, \u201cHow does she handle her critics?\u201d Oh, God, that is a wonderful question. \u201cDoes she read and comment on the internet trolls for her book reviews, podcasts, et cetera? How does she deal with the people who think they know more about relationships than her?\u201d So, I love this question because it allows me to say something. I am often considered a thought leader or an expert. I actually see myself much more as a student, and as a person who is avidly curious and continues to learn on a daily basis, rather than as someone who positions herself as knowing. I think about these things a lot. I can often sound very confident, but I\u2019m sure of nothing. One thing I can say is that nothing I say is made up, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. I also don\u2019t think there is one truth, and I think that I am a person who continuously seeks to be challenge. I go and check with other people. \u201cAm I missing something? Is there something I didn\u2019t think about? Is there validity in the criticism?\u201d I invite conversation, dialogue, confrontation, and disagreement. Where it hurts, where I find myself at a loss, is when people are taking one thing I say, completely distorting it, and caricaturing me or what I say when I try so hard to embrace complexity and nuance, and feel completely flattened by a complete misunderstanding of what I say, often to the extent where I wonder if the people actually really read my work and engaged with me, and I wish that the critics actually came to me, asked me, engaged with me, and challenged me, rather than just trashing me. I generally try not to read too much of it because it hurts, and because I don\u2019t feel that there is an invitation for the dialogue. Whoever comes to me directly and respectfully and says, \u201cI disagree, I think you\u2019re wrong, et cetera,\u201d I will speak with. Whoever is avoiding me and just going behind my back and using the internet to anonymously or not anonymously trash me is participating in the shame culture and in the trashing culture of the moment, with all the consequences that we know are involved in this. So, that\u2019s my relationship to criticism. I welcome it when it\u2019s done humanely and when it\u2019s done respectfully. SapFrank1 asks on Twitter, \u201cWe often hear communication is key in a relationship, but as I believe she has mentioned in her book, too much can hinder desire. What, then, is the juste milieu?\u201d Okay, listen: You make me think of a song by Carly Simon, \u201cNo Secrets,\u201d in which she has a line, \u201cSometimes, I wish I didn\u2019t know those secrets of yours.\u201d I think that the free love of the \u201860s came with a view of honesty, transparency, and letting it all hang out there. While it came with the rise of individualism, that everything that a person experiences is at the center, matters, and needs to be met, I also think that the other side of this kind of wholesale sharing and an ethos of candor like is that there needs to be consideration and politeness, and I find that those two qualities are often in short supply in contemporary relationships. There\u2019s this notion that we expect the partner to just hold on to all of our feelings and make us feel better, rather than engage a little bit more in our own self-soothing and our own self-regulation, and in going and venting to others. It actually has always been the case that people vented to people outside of the relationship in order to be able to sustain what happened on the inside. It\u2019s about not letting your emotional hemorrhoids bleed like that inside your house all the time. I don\u2019t know that this is always the best. Of course, we want communication, we want exchange, we want deepening and real meeting with the other, but I\u2019m not sure that this kind of \u201call out there\u201d is the only model. What you\u2019re always going to hear from me is that there isn\u2019t only one way. There isn\u2019t one size that fits all. So, while I answer you in one way, I may answer someone else differently, and I think it\u2019s that richness that I want us all to hold here. On occasion, let it be. You don\u2019t have to react to everything. Not everything is a 10. Certain things are just a 2. They\u2019re not really that important. That\u2019s another song that I think we need to be able to hum on occasion. In terms of not telling everything on the desire, it\u2019s really this: The questions and answers that you want to keep from your partner or vice versa are a way in which you remain curious, interested, and engaged with the other person as a person, the way that we often are in the beginning, where we are just interested in who this person is. What happens over time is that people often feel as if they know their partner, as if they belong to them, as if they\u2019re just an extension of them, and that\u2019s naturally a contrived illusion of safety. It\u2019s not true. In the face of the unknown which exists right in our midst, there is that mystery of the other, and the mystery of the other is simply available once you continue to be curious about them rather than assume this kind of familiarity. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say about the connection to desire. If desire exists in that space of exploration, of discovery, of curiosity, once you remain curious to your partner, once you continue to think of them as a person, not just as your partner, the desire can continue to thrive as well. The next question you\u2019re asking is, \u201cWhat, according to her observations and experience, are the essential blocks to build a strong foundation between partners, and what is essential in a relationship to maintain longevity?\u201d There are many pieces that I think are part of thriving relationships, but I\u2019ll give you a few that come up now, and if we meet again, you\u2019ll ask me again and I\u2019ll give you a few others. I\u2019ll go with No. 1. Not everything must be said. I think that in light of the culture that we live in today, I will probably say not everything must be said. If we were talking and meeting in other parts of the world, I would say the exact opposite. More things need to be spoken sometimes, okay? Just so you understand, these answers are always taking place in a specific cultural context. The second thing: I think one of the most important combinations in a relationship is a combination between empathy and responsibility. It\u2019s your ability to continue to see your partner from their own point of view. It\u2019s to enter the shoes of the other. On the other side, it\u2019s your ability to take responsibility for that which is yours \u2013 your own contribution, your mistakes, your flaws \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sorry I did this. Next time, I\u2019ll do differently.\u201d I own it. The minute you can own something, it gives you freedom, rather than thinking that all problems and all changes actually belong to the other person. The next piece that is really essential to the balance in a relationship is the ability to navigate separateness and togetherness, to have space to have individuality, to have self-expression, to have your own friends, to have your own experiences that are not all related to the couple. And then, also, to have very strong things that belong to the couple. But, some couples have a tiny overlap of the concentric circles and some couples have a complete overlap. So, there\u2019s a range. Some people love to just have a big togetherness and a small separateness, and others are the other way around, but it is that negotiation, and it changes over life. It\u2019s not one and the same when you meet and 15 years later. The next thing for a long relationship is flexibility. It\u2019s adaptability. It\u2019s your ability to say, \u201cWe used to do it like this, it worked for ten years, and it doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d Change is something that people are much more able to do in their companies and their workplaces than they are willing to do at home. This is often a real static attitude towards a relationship. We met a certain way, we set up a certain way \u2013 my role, your role, my responsibility, your responsibility \u2013 and it goes on like that for 35 years, and then we collapse. So, the ability to just come together and say, \u201cI need something different. Let\u2019s change this\u201d \u2013 I love couples who have an annual summit and review their relationship. Where is it going? How are we doing? You can even do it monthly. It shows intentionality. It shows attention. It shows care in the same way that you water your plants, rather than letting it go \u2013 laissez-faire \u2013 for a long time on end. That kind of diligence makes a big difference. And then, the last one I will say for longevity and for thriving relationships \u2013 because so many of you had the question about what makes a relationship last \u2013 is engaging with new experiences Not just comfortable and pleasant experiences \u2013 those make for a real familiarity and stability in the couple \u2013 but what really makes it thrive, what brings life and vitality, is the engagement with new experiences outside of the comfort zone because they breed new cells, and all the research is confirming that at this point. Novelty breeds testosterone, and it\u2019s not novelty of sex positions. It\u2019s really different ways of being with oneself in the relationship and with each other. So, all of that combined \u2013 you have a good chance to go for quite a while. Alex Sandalis on Twitter and Aspen Janai Mulcahy on Facebook are asking, \u201cHow do millennials bring back romance and emotional intimacy? What do you see as the biggest flaws of young men in their 20s and how they communicate with women? What advice do you have for them?\u201d I\u2019m going to divide this in two. Look: There isn\u2019t much romance when people make dates on text all the time. Today, romance will occasionally be a phone call. In the past, romance was a card. Who still gets picked up at the door? Who still gets brought back at the door? Who gets called the next morning? All these things are often seen as pass\u00e9 and old-century, but in fact, I don\u2019t think the repertoire has particularly changed. A text doesn\u2019t go very far in terms of flattery, does it? Anything that goes beyond the bare minimum is romance because romance is pining, romance is seduction, romance is flirtation, and that is a cultivated art by which you are gradually making the other person melt in your arms. But, for that, you have to be able to say, \u201cI want you,\u201d and that means you have to experience the vulnerability of putting yourself out there, and it seems that these days, too many young people are quite reluctant to experience the vulnerability and the uncertainty of not knowing, of making that phone call and hoping that somebody\u2019s going to answer, and it won\u2019t be her dad. And, that butterfly thing has been done away with. We have way too much immediate gratification, so there is no space in between to still experience the excitement, anticipation, and the uncertainty, but all of that was part of romance. That was the romantic plot. The romantic plot plays itself out in the \u201cWill it happen, won\u2019t it happen?\u201d The denouement is irrelevant. A romance novel is 300 pages, and last piece is only one page. It\u2019s 300 pages of \u201cWill it or will it not?\u201d That\u2019s romance. Now, in terms of the question of what to do, take the risks. Take the risks. Don\u2019t just go in a bar. It\u2019s not a boutique. Put yourself out there and say, \u201cI want you, and I\u2019ll take the time.\u201d I recently coached this guy, and he was very sweet \u2013 a woman basically calls it off at 7:00 on a Friday night. Not a very nice thing to do. She\u2019s busy, she has a meeting \u2013 whatever. It goes into a whole, \u201cShould I wait? Does that mean she\u2019s not interested?\u201d I just said, \u201cLook: Text her back and say, \u2018I understand, but twice as much time for tomorrow, please.\u2019\u201d Come back with something that is funny, that breeds confidence, that is assertive, and that says, \u201cI\u2019m still very interested, and you owe me a double dose.\u201d She liked it. Now, if she has no interest in him, then she will tell him at that moment, \u201cPlease don\u2019t bother.\u201d But, if she has a slight interest in him, he will gain a lot of points with one of those things. I\u2019ve done more and more coaching people lately just looking at their Tinder feeds, at the kinds of exchanges. Not only do they lack romance, they lack anything that says to people, \u201cYou\u2019re interesting to me and I would like to meet you.\u201d It\u2019s really thin. So, there is the issue of romance, but there is the broader question of how do people these days literally turn each other on? With their minds, not just the other ways. There\u2019s a beautiful book by Rob Garfield called Questioning the Male Code, which I recommend for many of you. The male code often comes with a \u201cfix it\u201d attitude, and \u201cfix it\u201d means, \u201cI have an answer, I have a solution,\u201d and it is part of the making of masculinity: Competence, performance, problem-solving. Unfortunately, in relationships with women, \u201cfix it\u201d doesn\u2019t often work because many times, she wants only to talk. She doesn\u2019t want to share the experience. She doesn\u2019t want to be told what to do. She\u2019s quite competent and knows what to do, and if you give her unsolicited advice, she\u2019ll experience it as patronizing. So, the flip side of \u201cfix it\u201d is empathy. It\u2019s two things: \u201cTell me more. Tell me more.\u201d That\u2019s all you need to do. You don\u2019t have to solve it. You just have to ask her if she wants to continue to talk about it, and you want to engage in empathic murmurings. \u201cHmm. Oh, really? Oh, that\u2019s tough. Oh, wow.\u201d That says, \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Most of the time, it\u2019s what she needs. If you want to give advice, ask her if she wants to hear it, and otherwise, wait until she asks for it. The fear that people sometimes have \u2013 that guys have \u2013 when they say, \u201cTell me more\u201d is that she\u2019s going to start and it will never stop. If she says, \u201cWe have to talk,\u201d he says, \u201cHow long?\u201d In fact, when you say, \u201cTell me more,\u201d the answer will be much shorter than if you don\u2019t and she still isn\u2019t sure that you really get it. So, that\u2019s really the main piece in terms of men and communication, and I\u2019m not so sure that is different for young guys, or even men of my generation \u2013 boomers. It\u2019s really that you don\u2019t have to have an answer, and you don\u2019t need to feel like you need to solve the problem or make the feelings go away. You actually need to do less, and your challenge is to still feel competent, even if you do less, but you will actually be much more appreciated. I had one other little thought when we talked about the things for longevity and the things for deepening the intimacy which I didn\u2019t talk about, which is people sitting in the morning and having breakfast, looking out the window, listening to music together, dancing together for a moment\u2026 The average pop song is 2.3 minutes. If you just do that, it doesn\u2019t take a long time. People sometimes think it\u2019s so much work to maintain this intimacy. It\u2019s actually not. It\u2019s 2.3 minutes to listen to some of the most beautiful love songs ever written and reconnect with that feeling between the two of you. I hope that I\u2019ve given you some ideas and inspirations \u2013 food for thought \u2013 in the pursuit of your own loving and thriving relationships. I want to add a piece to Gavilina\u2019s question, \u201cWhen do you know that a relationship is done?\u201d Gavilina, I was talking about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse that a famous researcher on relationships, John Guthman, talks about. I wanted to expand a little bit on that. One is criticism. It\u2019s quite easy, right? It\u2019s complaining, it\u2019s picking at the other person, it\u2019s seeing what you do as circumstantial, and seeing the other person as characterological. If you\u2019re in a bad mood, it\u2019s because you had a tough day, but if the other person doesn\u2019t act very nice, it\u2019s because they\u2019re actually generally a mean person or a bad-tempered person rather than that they may have also had a bad day. So, all the elements that have to do with criticism: The way that people just gnaw at the other person and go and circle around the same grievances over and over again \u2013 that\u2019s the piece that he\u2019s talking about. Stonewalling is the silent treatment. It\u2019s basically withdrawing, removing oneself and letting the other person stand out there and talk to the walls. That\u2019s another major Horseman of the Apocalypse. Defensiveness: The fact that you can\u2019t bring anything up without the other person instantly rejecting, getting defensive, going knee-jerk instead of just saying, \u201cYes, thank you for telling me, let me think about this,\u201d or simply, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel good, but\u2026I probably do that. I don\u2019t mean to, but I do, or it\u2019s a bad habit of mine.\u201d Something that acknowledges, that stands accountable, that doesn\u2019t answer, \u201cYeah, but you \u2013 you did worse,\u201d and then it starts to pile up, and for everything you said, the other person counters right away with something worse, so that you never have to look at the thing you said. \u201cYeah, but yesterday, you\u2026\u201d All of that defensiveness \u2013 it\u2019s very rich defensiveness, but it basically leaves you without the feeling that you can ever bring something up and that it will be responded to for its own sake. And then, contempt. That\u2019s the one that I think is the final killer for a relationship. I already detailed that one for you, but I wanted you to have a sense about \u2013 this is actually for your question about the relationship being done, but also the question that was asked by Alicia about how to lessen the arguments in your relationship. So, the opposite of these four killers of relationships have to do with how people stay connected in the midst of disagreement. This is something I wanted to expand on more for Alicia\u2019s question. You really need to know something about arguing in a relationship. It often has very little to do with the content of the argument itself. When couples enter into a vicious cycle, they are reactive, they escalate, they bicker, and they fight. The subject doesn\u2019t matter anymore at a certain point. If it\u2019s the kids, the car, the money, or what they were going to do for Christmas, it is all going to sound the same. What you\u2019ll hear is that people end up being in an interaction where they don\u2019t feel acknowledged, they don\u2019t feel validated, they feel dismissed, they feel that the other person competes with them, that they are outmaneuvered, and it doesn\u2019t matter what they talk about. So, the real truth about conflict in relationships is that the form precedes the content. The way these arguments unfold is one and the same. If it is this or it is about Greenpeace in South Korea, it makes no difference. It\u2019s no longer about the issue itself. Once you know that, then you have to go at the form, and the form is what the people are doing to each other while they say the things they say. What they\u2019re doing is this long list of control. The opposite of dismissing, disqualifying, and invalidating is acknowledging, recognizing, validating, and empathizing. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t agree. So, there is a very good method developed by Howard Markman. It\u2019s called PREP, and it\u2019s a book, Fighting for Your Marriage. It\u2019s actually quite good. In PREP, they basically tell you that in negative communication, you have ten seconds to get ready for the rebuttal. That\u2019s about as long as you can listen to something that your partner says that you disagree with, and ten seconds is three sentences. So, the way you minimize the arguments is by beginning to practice reflective listening. It\u2019s tedious and annoying, but it\u2019s highly effective. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing you say\u2026\u201d You repeat. \u201cIs there more?\u201d You repeat, and vice versa. And then, you talk. You do XYZ statements. \u201cWhen you do X in situation Y, I feel Z.\u201d \u201cWhen you don\u2019t even look up when I walk into the house because you\u2019re busy at your computer the whole time and I am trying to make a connection with you, I feel like I don\u2019t matter and you don\u2019t love me.\u201d Something like that. That is very different from \u201cYou couldn\u2019t give an F about me, and any time I come home, you pretend that you couldn\u2019t hear it on purpose.\u201d That\u2019s an attack. From that attack, all you\u2019re going to get is a defense, and the defense can be a counterattack, a stonewalling, a defensiveness, or a criticism, or a contempt. Here, you have your four horses. The sentence is broken down in such a way that if I have an experience of what you do, that is not the same as my definition of what you do. It says that when you do this, I experience it in a certain way, and that\u2019s my feeling, and you can\u2019t argue with another person\u2019s feeling. You can\u2019t argue with another person trying to define you and to define you negatively. That XYZ is intensely transformative when people really begin to practice it. So, that\u2019s one way out of the little hell of chronic arguments. Let me take a few other questions that I haven\u2019t spoken about. \u201cHow can men effectively handle their sex drive?\u201d asks Devi Winestock. Look, I don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by \u201ceffectively handle their sex drive.\u201d If you\u2019re asking what men do when they\u2019re horny and they want to have sex but they don\u2019t have partners available, or they have a steady partner who is not there at that moment or not interested, one of the things I would say is this. Sex for men is very much connected to what goes on inside of them: If they\u2019re angry, if they\u2019re happy, if they\u2019re anxious, if they\u2019re depressed, if they feel good about themselves, and if they don\u2019t. Some men turn to sex to soothe themselves when they\u2019re anxious \u2013 besides when they feel good. That\u2019s a given. Some men experience sex as the one and only language through which they can experience emotional intimacy. Some men experience sex as the only language through which they can feel tender, soft, or connected. It won\u2019t be the first time that you hear women describe guys open who they feel are truly there and are really intimate with them only in sex because it is the sanctioned language for guys to experience what are otherwise often forbidden emotions for men. So, for me, when you ask about effectively handling sex drives, it has to do with that. It has to do with not being just monolingual \u2013 having many languages available, having many ways to take care of our needs and feelings, and not just one. That\u2019s the effectiveness of sex, is to not have it be the only thing available. For the rest, I\u2019m not sure that there is a unique way to effectively deal with drives, but one thing you need to know: Sex is not a drive. You don\u2019t die from not having sex. You die from not being touched, but you don\u2019t die from not having sex. It\u2019s a motivational system, not a drive. That\u2019s not the same. Bing is asking, \u201cWhat are some of the suggestions and resources that she has for couples who want to explore having a more \u201cmonogamish\u201d relationship \u2013 not poly, but more flexible than traditional monogamy, especially when it comes to navigating boundaries, emotions, and sexual health?\u201d That\u2019s a beautiful question. First of all, there\u2019s the movie out right now, Tao Ruspoli\u2019s movie Monogamish. It\u2019s actually premiering in New York this week, so that will be \u2013 it\u2019s a very nice movie to see together because it really opens up the conversation. For me, the open relationship is less about what people actually do than the openness of the conversation itself. Many people don\u2019t nearly want to do as much as they want to do what they could if they wanted. They don\u2019t want to feel that they live with the restrictions of the boundaries. And then, it\u2019s a conversation. What is it that you miss? What is it that you feel drawn to? What would you like to experience? Do you want to experience it alone or together? Do you want me to know about it? Is it a turn-on for you if I tell you, or do you actually not want to know about it? Often, you\u2019ll find you have one of each in a couple. Is it something that you want that is fleeting, that if you meet someone, you want the possibility of letting something unfold and see where it takes you? Is it when you travel because you\u2019re often away, or is it that you have been with me since you were 17 and you want to know other partners because you\u2019ve never known others besides me? It\u2019s this whole conversation, and don\u2019t take it immediately as, \u201cSomething is missing. I can\u2019t give you everything. I should be everything for it. If you have any other interests, it must mean that I\u2019m not enough.\u201d It\u2019s really that conversation, and what you will find is that the couples for whom this is a joint interest \u2013 the conversation itself is often very enlivening, very vibrant, and very intimate because the possibility of talking to your partner about your longings for that which takes place outside, and to have it be recognized and accepted is a deeply intimate conversation. The recognition of your erotic freedom \u2013 on which you may not act, but that it exists even in fantasy, even in curiosity, even in longing, in interest \u2013 is profoundly intimate for couples. And then, you talk about it. Do I want to know? What do we tell each other? Do we notify in advance? Do we tell after it has happened? What is it that you don\u2019t want to know? Understand that you don\u2019t necessarily have a symmetric need. One of you may want to know more and one of you doesn\u2019t. One of you likes to share and one of you doesn\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to be one and the same. And then, you come back and examine it. It works for us, it doesn\u2019t work for us, it brings us closer, it makes us too nervous; in the end, it\u2019s not a good thing for us, or not right now because we have young kids and we\u2019re not equal, or because one of us is not working and we\u2019re not equal, or because one of us has been sick and we\u2019re not\u2026 By definition, there needs to be a certain level of equality in the relationship for the conversation to not be a power maneuver. Both people need to have the same possibilities. They may not both want to act on them, but they need to both know that they could if they wanted, and if that\u2019s part of the agreement. And then, you come back and examine it. Is this good for us? Does this work? When I say \u201cwork,\u201d I mean do we feel enriched by it, or do we feel like it\u2019s depleting us, that it\u2019s taking away from us, that ultimately, we thought it would be a great idea, but it\u2019s really not? Or, this has actually opened things up between us, we\u2019ve had a whole different level of honesty between us, a whole different depth of communication that never existed before. We bring back different parts of ourselves. The reunions are beautiful. We make love before we go off to meet someone else. We only accept it when one of us is traveling. It\u2019s a very rich conversation, and it\u2019s often many conversations before anybody even acts on any of this. That\u2019s how this process goes. You can read some books. You can read Taormina\u2019s book Open, you can read Sex at Dawn, and you can talk to other people who actually practice consensual nonmonogamy or varieties thereof, and you can ask how it works for them. You get ideas. But often, people don\u2019t tell you that\u2019s what they do because it\u2019s so negatively judged, so it\u2019s not like you can go and ask them, \u201cHow do you raise your children? I\u2019m looking for some ideas.\u201d But, you will find people who are willing to talk and have experienced it for years, so they\u2019re practiced at it. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s what works for you, but it inspires you. It gives you what you should be thinking about. That\u2019s how I would start this thing. The last question I will do: \u201cHow do I help people come to terms and come to accept themselves?\u201d For me, self-acceptance is really a process of maturation. I don\u2019t expect people in their 20s to easily accept themselves, so I do put this on a spectrum of time, but I do think the fundamental experience of accepting yourself is that you accept that you are flawed, you accept the things that are beautiful about you, and you begin to feel, \u201cI\u2019m good enough.\u201d That\u2019s the essence. It\u2019s not \u201cI\u2019m perfect,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m good enough,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m flawed, and I make mistakes, but they don\u2019t tank me. I don\u2019t feel massively embarrassed and ashamed about them. I\u2019m able to look at them and say, \u201cI\u2019ll do better next time. I\u2019ll do it differently next time. I\u2019ll learn from this.\u201d It\u2019s that process that is self-acceptance. I remember making mistakes and not sleeping for three weeks at a time, and churning and obsessing about it, and replaying it in my head. Today, I do some of these mistakes and just think, \u201cOkay. I know that mistake, and I don\u2019t like it. It doesn\u2019t feel good, but it doesn\u2019t cripple me anymore in the same way.\u201d I think that\u2019s the level of self-acceptance, but it is also knowing what you want and feeling okay about it, not feeling like you have to continuously justify, explain, apologize \u2013 it\u2019s what I call the healthy sense of entitlement, not a grandiose sense of entitlement. Self-acceptance is self-confidence. Self-acceptance is also the ability to live with your lack of confidence, your insecurities, and your uncertainties, and to say, \u201cThis is an area where I feel deeply insecure, and it\u2019s part of who I am.\u201d I have it all the time. All of this is self-acceptance. It\u2019s your ability to live with your sense of ambivalence: The things about yourself that you like and don\u2019t like. The things that you feel really good about and the things that you are very troubled by. The ability to integrate those two \u2013 the ability to live with ambivalence about oneself is an essential ingredient of self-acceptance. It\u2019s all of that. For me, it\u2019s a process of maturation over life. This is not something you just have one day. It grows on you slowly \u2013 physically, emotionally, in terms of lifestyle. You know what you like and you accept it. You don\u2019t force yourself to be who you\u2019re not. You\u2019re okay in your skin. I often say that if I had the confidence of today with the looks of then\u2026 When I was young, I didn\u2019t have the confidence. It\u2019s an interesting thing that has a lot more to do with life experience than with any actual training that you get. That\u2019s my suggestion for self-acceptance. Goodbye, thank you very much, I hope we talk again soon, and I hope that you can draw from some of these answers and feed on them for a while until the next meeting, as we say. Bon appetit. Bye.

facebook, \u201chow does she handle her critics?\u201d oh, god, that is a wonderful question", "\u201cdoes she read and comment on the internet trolls for her book reviews, podcasts, et cetera", "how does she deal with the people who think they know more about relationships than her?\u201d so, i love this question because it allows me to say something", "i am often considered a thought leader or an expert", "i actually see myself much more as a student, and as a person who is avidly curious and continues to learn on a daily basis, rather than as someone who positions herself as knowing", "i think about these things a lot", "i can often sound very confident, but i\u2019m sure of nothing", "one thing i can say is that nothing i say is made up, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true", "i also don\u2019t think there is one truth, and i think that i am a person who continuously seeks to be challenge", "i go and check with other people", "\u201cam i missing something", "is there something i didn\u2019t think about", "is there validity in the criticism?\u201d i invite conversation, dialogue, confrontation, and disagreement", "where it hurts, where i find myself at a loss, is when people are taking one thing i say, completely distorting it, and caricaturing me or what i say when i try so hard to embrace complexity and nuance, and feel completely flattened by a complete misunderstanding of what i say, often to the extent where i wonder if the people actually really read my work and engaged with me, and i wish that the critics actually came to me, asked me, engaged with me, and challenged me, rather than just trashing me", "i generally try not to read too much of it because it hurts, and because i don\u2019t feel that there is an invitation for the dialogue", "whoever comes to me directly and respectfully and says, \u201ci disagree, i think you\u2019re wrong, et cetera,\u201d i will speak with", "whoever is avoiding me and just going behind my back and using the internet to anonymously or not anonymously trash me is participating in the shame culture and in the trashing culture of the moment, with all the consequences that we know are involved in this", "so, that\u2019s my relationship to criticism", "i welcome it when it\u2019s done humanely and when it\u2019s done respectfully", "sapfrank1 asks on twitter, \u201cwe often hear communication is key in a relationship, but as i believe she has mentioned in her book, too much can hinder desire", "what, then, is the juste milieu?\u201d okay, listen: you make me think of a song by carly simon, \u201cno secrets,\u201d in which she has a line, \u201csometimes, i wish i didn\u2019t know those secrets of yours.\u201d i think that the free love of the \u201860s came with a view of honesty, transparency, and letting it all hang out there", "while it came with the rise of individualism, that everything that a person experiences is at the center, matters, and needs to be met, i also think that the other side of this kind of wholesale sharing and an ethos of candor like is that there needs to be consideration and politeness, and i find that those two qualities are often in short supply in contemporary relationships", "there\u2019s this notion that we expect the partner to just hold on to all of our feelings and make us feel better, rather than engage a little bit more in our own self-soothing and our own self-regulation, and in going and venting to others", "it actually has always been the case that people vented to people outside of the relationship in order to be able to sustain what happened on the inside", "it\u2019s about not letting your emotional hemorrhoids bleed like that inside your house all the time", "i don\u2019t know that this is always the best", "of course, we want communication, we want exchange, we want deepening and real meeting with the other, but i\u2019m not sure that this kind of \u201call out there\u201d is the only model", "what you\u2019re always going to hear from me is that there isn\u2019t only one way", "there isn\u2019t one size that fits all", "so, while i answer you in one way, i may answer someone else differently, and i think it\u2019s that richness that i want us all to hold here", "on occasion, let it be", "you don\u2019t have to react to everything", "not everything is a 10", "certain things are just a 2", "they\u2019re not really that important", "that\u2019s another song that i think we need to be able to hum on occasion", "in terms of not telling everything on the desire, it\u2019s really this: the questions and answers that you want to keep from your partner or vice versa are a way in which you remain curious, interested, and engaged with the other person as a person, the way that we often are in the beginning, where we are just interested in who this person is", "what happens over time is that people often feel as if they know their partner, as if they belong to them, as if they\u2019re just an extension of them, and that\u2019s naturally a contrived illusion of safety", "it\u2019s not true", "in the face of the unknown which exists right in our midst, there is that mystery of the other, and the mystery of the other is simply available once you continue to be curious about them rather than assume this kind of familiarity", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m trying to say about the connection to desire", "if desire exists in that space of exploration, of discovery, of curiosity, once you remain curious to your partner, once you continue to think of them as a person, not just as your partner, the desire can continue to thrive as well", "the next question you\u2019re asking is, \u201cwhat, according to her observations and experience, are the essential blocks to build a strong foundation between partners, and what is essential in a relationship to maintain longevity?\u201d there are many pieces that i think are part of thriving relationships, but i\u2019ll give you a few that come up now, and if we meet again, you\u2019ll ask me again and i\u2019ll give you a few others", "i\u2019ll go with no", "1", "not everything must be said", "i think that in light of the culture that we live in today, i will probably say not everything must be said", "if we were talking and meeting in other parts of the world, i would say the exact opposite", "more things need to be spoken sometimes, okay", "just so you understand, these answers are always taking place in a specific cultural context", "the second thing: i think one of the most important combinations in a relationship is a combination between empathy and responsibility", "it\u2019s your ability to continue to see your partner from their own point of view", "it\u2019s to enter the shoes of the other", "on the other side, it\u2019s your ability to take responsibility for that which is yours \u2013 your own contribution, your mistakes, your flaws \u2013 \u201ci\u2019m sorry i did this", "next time, i\u2019ll do differently.\u201d i own it", "the minute you can own something, it gives you freedom, rather than thinking that all problems and all changes actually belong to the other person", "the next piece that is really essential to the balance in a relationship is the ability to navigate separateness and togetherness, to have space to have individuality, to have self-expression, to have your own friends, to have your own experiences that are not all related to the couple", "and then, also, to have very strong things that belong to the couple", "but, some couples have a tiny overlap of the concentric circles and some couples have a complete overlap", "so, there\u2019s a range", "some people love to just have a big togetherness and a small separateness, and others are the other way around, but it is that negotiation, and it changes over life", "it\u2019s not one and the same when you meet and 15 years later", "the next thing for a long relationship is flexibility", "it\u2019s adaptability", "it\u2019s your ability to say, \u201cwe used to do it like this, it worked for ten years, and it doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d change is something that people are much more able to do in their companies and their workplaces than they are willing to do at home", "this is often a real static attitude towards a relationship", "we met a certain way, we set up a certain way \u2013 my role, your role, my responsibility, your responsibility \u2013 and it goes on like that for 35 years, and then we collapse", "so, the ability to just come together and say, \u201ci need something different", "let\u2019s change this\u201d \u2013 i love couples who have an annual summit and review their relationship", "where is it going", "how are we doing", "you can even do it monthly", "it shows intentionality", "it shows attention", "it shows care in the same way that you water your plants, rather than letting it go \u2013 laissez-faire \u2013 for a long time on end", "that kind of diligence makes a big difference", "and then, the last one i will say for longevity and for thriving relationships \u2013 because so many of you had the question about what makes a relationship last \u2013 is engaging with new experiences not just comfortable and pleasant experiences \u2013 those make for a real familiarity and stability in the couple \u2013 but what really makes it thrive, what brings life and vitality, is the engagement with new experiences outside of the comfort zone because they breed new cells, and all the research is confirming that at this point", "novelty breeds testosterone, and it\u2019s not novelty of sex positions", "it\u2019s really different ways of being with oneself in the relationship and with each other", "so, all of that combined \u2013 you have a good chance to go for quite a while", "alex sandalis on twitter and aspen janai mulcahy on facebook are asking, \u201chow do millennials bring back romance and emotional intimacy", "what do you see as

when people make dates on text all the time", "today, romance will occasionally be a phone call", "in the past, romance was a card", "who still gets picked up at the door", "who still gets brought back at the door", "who gets called the next morning", "all these things are often seen as pass\u00e9 and old-century, but in fact, i don\u2019t think the repertoire has particularly changed", "a text doesn\u2019t go very far in terms of flattery, does it", "anything that goes beyond the bare minimum is romance because romance is pining, romance is seduction, romance is flirtation, and that is a cultivated art by which you are gradually making the other person melt in your arms", "but, for that, you have to be able to say, \u201ci want you,\u201d and that means you have to experience the vulnerability of putting yourself out there, and it seems that these days, too many young people are quite reluctant to experience the vulnerability and the uncertainty of not knowing, of making that phone call and hoping that somebody\u2019s going to answer, and it won\u2019t be her dad", "and, that butterfly thing has been done away with", "we have way too much immediate gratification, so there is no space in between to still experience the excitement, anticipation, and the uncertainty, but all of that was part of romance", "that was the romantic plot", "the romantic plot plays itself out in the \u201cwill it happen, won\u2019t it happen?\u201d the denouement is irrelevant", "a romance novel is 300 pages, and last piece is only one page", "it\u2019s 300 pages of \u201cwill it or will it not?\u201d that\u2019s romance", "now, in terms of the question of what to do, take the risks", "take the risks", "don\u2019t just go in a bar", "it\u2019s not a boutique", "put yourself out there and say, \u201ci want you, and i\u2019ll take the time.\u201d i recently coached this guy, and he was very sweet \u2013 a woman basically calls it off at 7:00 on a friday night", "not a very nice thing to do", "she\u2019s busy, she has a meeting \u2013 whatever", "it goes into a whole, \u201cshould i wait", "does that mean she\u2019s not interested?\u201d i just said, \u201clook: text her back and say,

interested, and you owe me a double dose.\u201d she liked it", "now, if she has no interest in him, then she will tell him at that moment, \u201cplease don\u2019t bother.\u201d but, if she has a slight interest in him, he will gain a lot of points with one of those things", "i\u2019ve done more and more coaching people lately just looking at their tinder feeds, at the kinds of exchanges", "not only do they lack romance, they lack anything that says to people, \u201cyou\u2019re interesting to me and i would like to meet you.\u201d it\u2019s really thin", "so, there is the issue of romance, but there is the broader question of how do people these days literally turn each other on", "with their minds, not just the other ways", "there\u2019s a beautiful book by rob garfield called questioning the male code, which i recommend for many of you", "the male code often comes with a \u201cfix it\u201d attitude, and \u201cfix it\u201d means, \u201ci have an answer, i have a solution,\u201d and it is part of the making of masculinity: competence, performance, problem-solving", "unfortunately, in relationships with women, \u201cfix it\u201d doesn\u2019t often work because many times, she wants only to talk", "she doesn\u2019t want to share the experience", "she doesn\u2019t want to be told what to do", "she\u2019s quite competent and knows what to do, and if you give her unsolicited advice, she\u2019ll experience it as patronizing", "so, the flip side of \u201cfix it\u201d is empathy", "it\u2019s two things: \u201ctell me more", "tell me more.\u201d that\u2019s all you need to do", "you don\u2019t have to solve it", "you just have to ask her if she wants to continue to talk about it, and you want to engage in empathic murmurings", "\u201chmm", "oh, really", "oh, that\u2019s tough", "oh, wow.\u201d that says, \u201ci\u2019m listening.\u201d most of the time, it\u2019s what she needs", "if you want to give advice, ask her if she wants to hear it, and otherwise, wait until she asks for it", "the fear that people sometimes have \u2013 that guys have \u2013 when they say, \u201ctell me more\u201d is that she\u2019s going to start and it will never stop", "if she says, \u201cwe have to talk,\u201d he says, \u201chow long?\u201d in fact, when you say, \u201ctell me more,\u201d the answer will be much shorter than if you don\u2019t and she still isn\u2019t sure that you really get it", "so, that\u2019s really the main piece in terms of men and communication, and i\u2019m not so sure that is different for young guys, or even men of my generation \u2013 boomers", "it\u2019s really that you don\u2019t have to have an answer, and you don\u2019t need to feel like you need to solve the problem or make the feelings go away", "you actually need to do less, and your challenge is to still feel competent, even if you do less, but you will actually be much more appreciated", "i had one other little thought when we talked about the things for longevity and the things for deepening the intimacy which i didn\u2019t talk about, which is people sitting in the morning and having breakfast, looking out the window, listening to music together, dancing together for a moment\u2026 the average pop song is 2.3 minutes", "if you just do that, it doesn\u2019t take a long time", "people sometimes think it\u2019s so much work to maintain this intimacy", "it\u2019s actually not", "it\u2019s 2.3 minutes to listen to some of the most beautiful love songs ever written and reconnect with that feeling between the two of you", "i hope that i\u2019ve given you some ideas and inspirations \u2013 food for thought \u2013 in the pursuit of your own loving and thriving relationships", "i want to add a piece to gavilina\u2019s question, \u201cwhen do you know that a relationship is done?\u201d gavilina, i was talking about the four horsemen of the apocalypse that a famous researcher on relationships, john guthman, talks about", "i wanted to expand a little bit on that", "one is criticism", "it\u2019s quite easy, right", "it\u2019s complaining, it\u2019s picking at the other person, it\u2019s seeing what you do as circumstantial, and seeing the other person as characterological", "if you\u2019re in a bad mood, it\u2019s because you had a tough day, but if the other person doesn\u2019t act very nice, it\u2019s because they\u2019re actually generally a mean person or a bad-tempered person rather than that they may have also had a bad day", "so, all the elements that have to do with criticism: the way that people just gnaw at the other person and go and circle around the same grievances over and over again \u2013 that\u2019s the piece that he\u2019s talking about", "stonewalling is the silent treatment", "it\u2019s basically withdrawing, removing oneself and letting the other person stand out there and talk to the walls", "that\u2019s another major horseman of the apocalypse", "defensiveness: the fact that you can\u2019t bring anything up without the other person instantly rejecting, getting defensive, going knee-jerk instead of just saying, \u201cyes, thank you for telling me, let me think about this,\u201d or simply, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t feel good, but\u2026i probably do that", "i don\u2019t mean to, but i do, or it\u2019s a bad habit of mine.\u201d something that acknowledges, that stands accountable, that doesn\u2019t answer, \u201cyeah, but you \u2013 you did worse,\u201d and then it starts to pile up, and for everything you said, the other person counters right away with something worse, so that you never have to look at the thing you said", "\u201cyeah, but yesterday, you\u2026\u201d all of that defensiveness \u2013 it\u2019s very rich defensiveness, but it basically leaves you without the feeling that you can ever bring something up and that it will be responded to for its own sake", "and then, contempt", "that\u2019s the one that i think is the final killer for a relationship", "i already detailed that one for you, but i wanted you to have a sense about \u2013 this is actually for your question about the relationship being done, but also the question that was asked by alicia about how to lessen the arguments in your relationship", "so, the opposite of these four killers of relationships have to do with how people stay connected in the midst of disagreement", "this is something i wanted to expand on more for alicia\u2019s question", "you really need to know something about arguing in a relationship", "it often has very little to do with the content of the argument itself", "when couples enter into a vicious cycle, they are reactive, they escalate, they bicker, and they fight", "the subject doesn\u2019t matter anymore at a certain point", "if it\u2019s the kids, the car, the money, or what they were going to do for christmas, it is all going to sound the same", "what you\u2019ll hear is that people end up being in an interaction where they don\u2019t feel acknowledged, they don\u2019t feel validated, they feel dismissed, they feel that the other person competes with them, that they are outmaneuvered, and it doesn\u2019t matter what they talk about", "so, the real truth about conflict in relationships is that the form precedes the content", "the way these arguments unfold is one and the same", "if it is this or it is about greenpeace in south korea, it makes no difference", "it\u2019s no longer about the issue itself", "once you know that, then you have to go at the form, and the form is what the people are doing to each other while they say the things they say", "what they\u2019re doing is this long list of control", "the opposite of dismissing, disqualifying, and invalidating is acknowledging, recognizing, validating, and empathizing", "that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t agree", "so, there is a very good method developed by howard markman", "it\u2019s called prep, and it\u2019s a book, fighting for your marriage", "it\u2019s actually quite good", "in prep, they basically tell you that in negative communication, you have ten seconds to get ready for the rebuttal", "that\u2019s about as long as you can listen to something that your partner says that you disagree with, and ten seconds is three sentences", "so, the way you minimize the arguments is by beginning to practice reflective listening", "it\u2019s tedious and annoying, but it\u2019s highly effective", "\u201cwhat i\u2019m hearing you say\u2026\u201d you repeat", "\u201cis there more?\u201d you repeat, and vice versa", "and then, you talk", "you do xyz statements", "\u201cwhen you do x in situation y, i feel z.\u201d \u201cwhen you don\u2019t even look up when i walk into the house because you\u2019re busy at your computer the whole time and i am trying to make a connection with you, i feel like i don\u2019t matter and you don\u2019t love me.\u201d something like that", "that is very different from \u201cyou couldn\u2019t give an f about me, and any time i come home, you pretend that you couldn\u2019t hear it on purpose.\u201d that\u2019s an attack", "from that attack, all you\u2019re going to get is a defense, and the defense can be a counterattack, a stonewalling, a defensiveness, or a criticism, or a contempt", "here, you have your four horses", "the sentence is broken down in such a way that if i have an experience of what you do, that is not the same as my definition of what you do", "it says that when you do this, i experience it in a certain way, and that\u2019s my feeling, and you can\u2019t argue with another person\u2019s feeling", "you can\u2019t argue with another person trying to define you and to define you negatively", "that xyz is intensely transformative when people really begin to practice it", "so, that\u2019s one way out of the little hell of chronic arguments", "let me take a few other questions that i haven\u2019t spoken about", "\u201chow can men effectively handle their sex drive?\u201d asks devi winestock", "look, i don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by \u201ceffectively handle their sex drive.\u201d if you\u2019re asking what men do when they\u2019re horny and they want to have sex but they don\u2019t have partners available, or they have a steady partner who is not there at that moment or not interested, one of the things i would say is this", "sex for men is very much connected to what goes on inside of them: if they\u2019re angry, if they\u2019re happy, if they\u2019re anxious, if they\u2019re depressed, if they feel good about themselves, and if they don\u2019t", "some men turn to sex to soothe themselves when they\u2019re anxious \u2013 besides when they feel good", "that\u2019s a given", "some men experience sex as the one and only language through which they can experience emotional intimacy", "some men experience sex as the only language through which they can feel tender, soft, or connected", "it won\u2019t be the first time that you hear women describe guys open who they feel are truly there and are really intimate with them only in sex because it is the sanctioned language for guys to experience what are otherwise often forbidden emotions for men", "so, for me, when you ask about effectively handling sex drives, it has to do with that", "it has to do with not being just monolingual \u2013 having many languages available, having many ways to take care of our needs and feelings, and not just one", "that\u2019s the effectiveness of sex, is to not have it be the only thing available", "for the rest, i\u2019m not sure that there is a unique way to effectively deal with drives, but one thing you need to know: sex is not a drive", "you don\u2019t die from not having sex", "you die from not being touched, but you don\u2019t die from not having sex", "it\u2019s a motivational system, not a drive", "that\u2019s not the same", "bing is asking, \u201cwhat are some of the suggestions and resources that she has for couples who want to explore having a more \u201cmonogamish\u201d relationship \u2013 not poly, but more flexible than traditional

ruspoli\u2019s movie monogamish", "it\u2019s actually premiering in new york this week, so that will be \u2013 it\u2019s a very nice movie to see together because it really opens up the conversation", "for me, the open relationship is less about what people actually do than the openness of the conversation itself", "many people don\u2019t nearly want to do as much as they want to do what they could if they wanted", "they don\u2019t want to feel that they live with the restrictions of the boundaries", "and then, it\u2019s a conversation", "what is it that you miss", "what is it that you feel drawn to", "what would you like to experience", "do you want to experience it alone or together", "do you want me to know about it", "is it a turn-on for you if i tell you, or do you actually not want to know about it", "often, you\u2019ll find you have one of each in a couple", "is it something that you want that is fleeting, that if you meet someone, you want the possibility of letting something unfold and see where it takes you", "is it when you travel because you\u2019re often away, or is it that you have been with me since you were 17 and you want to know other partners because you\u2019ve

to have it be recognized and accepted is a deeply intimate conversation", "the recognition of your erotic freedom \u2013 on which you may not act, but that it exists even in fantasy, even in

of the agreement", "and then, you come back and examine it", "is this good for us", "does this work", "when i say \u201cwork,\u201d i mean do we feel enriched by it, or do we feel like it\u2019s depleting us, that it\u2019s taking away from us, that ultimately, we thought it would be a great idea, but it\u2019s really not", "or, this has actually opened things up between us, we\u2019ve had a whole different level of honesty between us, a whole different depth of communication that never existed before", "we bring back different parts of ourselves", "the reunions are beautiful", "we make love before we go off to meet someone else", "we only accept it when one of us is traveling", "it\u2019s a very rich conversation, and it\u2019s often many conversations before anybody even acts on any of this", "that\u2019s how this process goes", "you can read some books", "you can read taormina\u2019s book open, you can read sex at dawn, and you can talk to other people who actually practice consensual nonmonogamy or varieties thereof, and you can ask how it works for them", "you get ideas", "but often, people don\u2019t tell you that\u2019s what they do because it\u2019s so negatively judged, so it\u2019s not like you can go and ask them, \u201chow do you raise your children", "i\u2019m looking for some ideas.\u201d but, you will find people who are willing to talk and have experienced it for years, so they\u2019re practiced at it", "that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s what works for you, but it inspires you", "it gives you what you should be thinking about", "that\u2019s how i would start this thing", "the last question i will do: \u201chow do i help people come to terms and come to accept themselves?\u201d for me, self-acceptance is really a process of maturation", "i don\u2019t expect people in their 20s to easily accept themselves, so i do put this on a spectrum of time, but i do think the fundamental experience of accepting yourself is that you accept that you are flawed, you accept the things that are beautiful about you, and you begin to feel, \u201ci\u2019m good enough.\u201d that\u2019s the essence", "it\u2019s not \u201ci\u2019m perfect,\u201d it\u2019s \u201ci\u2019m good enough,\u201d or \u201ci\u2019m flawed, and i make mistakes, but they don\u2019t tank me", "i don\u2019t feel massively embarrassed and ashamed about them", "i\u2019m able to look at them and say, \u201ci\u2019ll do better next time", "i\u2019ll do it differently next time", "i\u2019ll learn from this.\u201d it\u2019s that process that is self-acceptance", "i remember making mistakes and not sleeping for three weeks at a time, and churning and obsessing about it, and replaying it in my head", "today, i do some of these mistakes and just think, \u201cokay", "i know that mistake, and i don\u2019t like it", "it doesn\u2019t feel good, but it doesn\u2019t cripple me anymore in the same way.\u201d i think that\u2019s the level of self-acceptance, but it is also knowing what you want and feeling okay about it, not feeling like you have to continuously justify, explain, apologize \u2013 it\u2019s what i call the healthy sense of entitlement, not a grandiose sense of entitlement", "self-acceptance is self-confidence", "self-acceptance is also the ability to live with your lack of confidence, your insecurities, and your uncertainties, and to say, \u201cthis is an area where i feel deeply insecure, and it\u2019s part of who i am.\u201d i have it all the time", "all of this is self-acceptance", "it\u2019s your ability to live with your sense of ambivalence: the things about yourself that you like and don\u2019t like", "the things that you feel really good about and the things that you are very troubled by", "the ability to integrate those two \u2013 the ability to live with ambivalence about oneself is an essential ingredient of self-acceptance", "it\u2019s all of that", "for me, it\u2019s a process of maturation over life", "this is not something you just have one day", "it grows on you slowly \u2013 physically, emotionally, in terms of lifestyle", "you know what you like and you accept it", "you don\u2019t force yourself to be who you\u2019re not", "you\u2019re okay in your skin", "i often say that if i had the confidence of today with the looks of then\u2026 when i was young, i didn\u2019t have the confidence", "it\u2019s an interesting thing that has a lot more to do with life experience than with any actual training that you get", "that\u2019s my suggestion for self-acceptance", "goodbye, thank you very much, i hope we talk again soon, and i hope that you can draw from some of these answers and feed on them for a while until the next meeting, as we say", "bon appetit", "bye"]}
