Hello, boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show, where each episode it is my job to deconstruct a world-class performer, to tease out the habits, routines, tips, favorite books, etcetera, that you can use. Whether that is someone like Jamie Foxx or a chess prodigy or a special operations commander and everybody in between. This episode we have Alex Honnold. I\u2019ve wanted to interview Alex for a very, very long time. You can find him on Facebook.com/AlexHonnold, H-O-N-N-O-L-D. He is a professional adventure rock climber who is free solo. That means no ropes; no partner ascents of America\u2019s biggest cliffs have made him one of the most recognized and followed climbers in the world. If you want to sweat profusely from your palms, you can watch videos of Alex, and I\u2019ll put them in the show notes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. Honnold is distinguished for his uncanny ability to control fear while scaling cliffs of dizzying heights without a rope to protect him, and we really dig into that, how he looks at risk, fear, addresses both in training and with these first ascent attempts and so on. His most celebrated achievements include the first and only free solos of the Moonlight Buttress, that\u2019s a 5.12D, which means super fucken hard. That\u2019s 1200 feet in Zion National Park in Utah. And the Northwest Face, that\u2019s a 5.12A of half dome, 2200 feet, and that is in Yosemite in California. Right in my backyard. Beautiful spot. In 2012 he achieved Yosemite\u2019s first triple solo. Climbing, that means in succession, the national park\u2019s three largest faces, Mount Watkins, Half Dome and El Capitan alone and all in under 24 hours. He is the founder of the Honnold Foundation, environmental non-profit, and to this day, and perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects of Alex, is he maintains a very, very minimalist dirtbag climber existence, and that\u2019s not meant as a slight. That is meant as a compliment. Living out of his van and I think he\u2019s done that for the last ten years or so, despite the fact that he has big sponsors. And traveling the world in search of the next great vertical adventure. So we dig into all sorts of things. And without further ado, I will let you hear the wide ranging conversation that I had with Alex Honnold. Tim Ferriss: Alex, welcome to the show. Alex Honnold: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me. Tim Ferriss: I have wanted to interview you ever since I first saw footage of you climbing, because I trained long ago at Mission Cliffs here in San Francisco, and did top roping, never have climbed outside except for Castle Rock, I don\u2019t know if you know it. Alex Honnold: Yeah, by Santa Cruz. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. Alex Honnold: That\u2019s where I started as a kid, kind of. Tim Ferriss: Really? Alex Honnold: Yeah, that\u2019s where local area is. Tim Ferriss: So you grew up in Sacramento or am I making that up? Alex Honnold: Yeah. Yeah, I grew up in Sacramento. Tim Ferriss: And what was your upbringing like? I mean if you had to describe your childhood, how would you take a stab at it? Alex Honnold: Just normal, suburban life, you know Sacramento, good times. Tim Ferriss: Good times, Sac Town. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time there. I mean Mark Bell, who\u2019s a buddy, has a gym called Super Training Gym up there. He\u2019s I think one of the top ten in his weight class of all time. That is the extent of my exposure to Sacramento, is just hanging out with him and feeling really weak. Alex Honnold: Hm. Tim Ferriss: Which probably would have been the experience if I\u2019d gone climbing with you even in the early days. What did your parents do? Alex Honnold: My parents were both teachers, or professors. Tim Ferriss: What did they teach? Alex Honnold: They taught language. Like, English as a second language in French. Tim Ferriss: Were your parents born in the US or were they elsewhere? Alex Honnold: Yeah, they were both born in the US, though Mom was born to Polish immigrants, so that means she\u2019s born in the US and she\u2019s American. And her parents were actually born here too, but they were like 100 Polish, like fresh off the boat, so. Tim Ferriss: How did you start climbing? I know it\u2019s probably a story that you\u2019ve told a million times, but how did that begin? Alex Honnold: My parents just read about a gym opening in Sacramento and they thought I\u2019d like it, so they took me to a climbing gym. I mean, just like you were saying that Mission Cliffs, like there was a comparable gym in Sacramento, and so I went in there when I was maybe 11 and then just kept going all the time. Tim Ferriss: What was the first day like? Can you describe \u2013? Alex Honnold: Like I honestly have no recollection. I was like an 11-year-old. And then I probably went to the gym, you know, three to five times a week from 11 to 18, so it\u2019s like it all kind of blurs into like one epic gym session. Tim Ferriss: Did you know in the early days of going to that gym that you had a predisposition to it? Alex Honnold: No, not particularly. I mean, I loved climbing and I loved going in there and just playing all the time and climbing as much as I could. But I was never like gifted in the way that a lot of people are gifted rock climbers. And, you know, I wasn\u2019t like winning the competitions or anything. I did some comps on an off throughout my teenage years, and I never won, you know. I was never super strong. But I just like loved climbing all the time. Tim Ferriss: Why do you think you didn\u2019t win? I mean what \u2013 Alex Honnold: Well, because I wasn\u2019t very strong, you know. Tim Ferriss: Strong \u2013 no, but strong meaning in what capacity? Like, I like to dig into the details with this. Alex Honnold: Well, like for example, I mean this is kind of getting into the nitty-gritty, but sort of like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: No, that\u2019s what this is about. Alex Honnold: Okay, here we go. So Chris Sharma is like basically has been the best climber in the world for the last 20 years and he was like my hero when I was a kid. Or, you know, he was one of the people I watched videos of and I was like, \u201cThat guy\u2019s the man.\u201d So he\u2019s from Santa Cruz. He started climbing when he was 14. And when he was 15 he put up a route called Necessary Evil outside of Las Vegas, and he was like the 14C in the country. So it was the hardest route in America and he did it after one year of climbing as a 15-year-old. I mean that\u2019s like a prodigy. I mean he was like freakishly strong from the get-go. He could just always pull on really small edges. He had freakishly strong fingers. He could do one arm pullups off like anything. You, like that guy\u2019s gifted. I was not that guy, you know. Actually, the season I tried to do that route, Necessary Evil this winter and I totally failed on it. It\u2019s like I still couldn\u2019t do it. And I was like, \u201cGod damn, I\u2019ve been climbing for 20 years and I like tried pretty hard, you know, and I still just can\u2019t climb as well as he did after one year.\u201d I still can\u2019t climb as hard. Like, I\u2019m just not as strong as he was after one year. I mean there are plenty of things that I\u2019m probably better at than he is, you know, it\u2019s all relative technique and everything. Tim Ferriss: What would some of those things be that you\u2019re better at? Not to necessarily compare you to him, but that you\u2019re very good at. Alex Honnold: Well, he\u2019s never done any alpine climbing, he\u2019s never really done any big wall, and he\u2019s probably not super-efficient logistically and, you know, but he\u2019s very, very strong and I\u2019m just not strong like that. But, you know, but I do other types of climbing. Tim Ferriss: For those people who are not familiar with the world of climbing, could you describe some of the different types? So the alpine, big wall. Alex Honnold: Yeah, so climbing is pretty complicated, because it ranges from say, indoor bouldering, which is probably the simplest thing you could possible do, to alpine climbing. You know, climbing in the Himalaya or climbing huge walls around the world. And so that involves like ice and mixed climbing where you\u2019re using ice tools and crampons and that kind of gear. And then, you know, there\u2019s big wall climbing, which is basically climbing huge vertical rock walls where you\u2019re on the wall for multiple days. Then there\u2019s \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s just a ton of categories Tim Ferriss: And the bouldering, so for people who don\u2019t know what that is, that\u2019s typically \u2013 it\u2019s no ropes. Alex Honnold: Yeah, it\u2019s un-roped. It\u2019s \u2013 I mean an easy way to think of it is practice climbing. Tim Ferriss: Right. Alex Honnold: You know, basically you\u2019re practicing movements, so you\u2019re climbing maybe three or four meters, maybe five max. You know, but you\u2019re climbing small \u2013 small heights that you\u2019re comfortable falling off and landing on a pad, and you\u2019re basically just doing really hard physical moves. It\u2019s actually an easy way to compare it is to the running world between sprinting and ultra-running or something. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: Like the spectrum of climbing ranges from short and super-intense to super-super long, but obviously low intensity. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: And I\u2019ve always been more of the low intensity, long distance type of guy. You know, where some people are just freakishly strong. Tim Ferriss: And you were attracted to that because of the relative lack of strength, or was there something else that appealed to you about that? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think it might just be one of those things that I sort of naturally gravitated towards the thing that suits me. But I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think part of it is just that I\u2019ve always loved climbing. I like doing a lot of rock climbing. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: And so I\u2019ve always been attracted to high volume. I mean, I look to like take the routes in my guide book, you know, and be like, \u201cOh, I climbed this and I climbed that.\u201d And so I like to climb a lot of routes. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: Yeah. So it\u2019s just \u2013 yeah, I mean, I just \u2013 I like climbing a lot. Tim Ferriss: Well, I think that is certainly clear. I wonder what \u2013 what did you think you were going be, or what did you fantasize about becoming when you grew up when you were a kid? Alex Honnold: I mean, as a kid I thought I was going to become an engineer or something, you know. I just thought I would have some normal job. I mean, when I was growing up there really wasn\u2019t a professional climbing scene. Like you couldn\u2019t really be a professional climber, because the whole climbing industry hadn\u2019t really taken off and there weren\u2019t so many gyms and it was like a different world.\u00a0 So I never thought that I was going to be a climber. I just thought that I\u2019d have some random job. Tim Ferriss: You \u2013 now I\u2019m going off the Internet here, so that\u2019s a risky business. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But you ended up at one point at \u2013 was it UC Berkeley? Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Planning to be an engineer. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What type of engineering? Alex Honnold: I\u2019d applied for civil engineering. I was going to \u2013 yeah. Tim Ferriss: Why civil? Alex Honnold: I mean, basically one of my uncles was a civil engineer. I was like, that\u2019s cool, you know. And I loved \u2013 I liked building things and the idea of like building bridges or like big projects like that. I mean, it\u2019s appealing, you know, the idea of like constructing something cool. Tim Ferriss: Did you collect anything as a kid or do you \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, I was way into Legos. Tim Ferriss: Legos, okay. So no, this is like a theme, right, so. The kind of large structures, large walls, how long did you collect the Legos for? I mean do you have any idea? I\u2019m not looking for any timelines here, but. Alex Honnold: No. Well, I don\u2019t know when I first started getting Legos, but probably when I was really small, and then up until being a teenager basically I had a ton of Legos. Tim Ferriss: Did you have any like \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 coup de grace is not the right expression here. I\u2019m looking for like your landmark piece. Is there anything that you remember? Like I had friends who built like the death star out of Legos and that was like the pinnacle of their Lego career. Alex Honnold: No, I mean, I think I had a few just epic forts and like really cool pirate ships and things. No, but I never constructed anything that was like the culmination of my Lego career. The thing is, I think I took almost as much pleasure in destroying the things afterward, you know, because you create like this elaborate city and then my sister and I would take like a golf ball or something and just like destroy it. And be like, oh, starting over. It\u2019s more the process of building it that was so fun. Tim Ferriss: And do you have one sibling, or do you have more? Alex Honnold: Yeah, I have an older sister, that\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss: Older sister. How much older? Alex Honnold: Two years older. Tim Ferriss: Do you talk to her much? Alex Honnold: Yeah, we\u2019re good friends. We chat a fair amount, yeah. Tim Ferriss: What does she do professionally? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s complicated. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s complicated. Alex Honnold: She basically just like makes the world a better place. She\u2019s lived in Portland since she went to college there and she\u2019s like vegan and has never owned a car. She\u2019s like ultra-earth [inaudible]. And she basically does outdoor participation stuff with kids and it\u2019s kind of like \u2013 I don\u2019t even \u2013 she\u2019s basically getting like at-risk \u2013 it\u2019s like a work program for at-risk youth or, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like a \u2013 whole thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: But over the years she\u2019s also been like a middle school teacher and she\u2019s done like bike programs with kids and all kinds of, you know, wholesome things to make the community better. Tim Ferriss: If you had to pick a fixed location, and we\u2019re definitely going to get to the van and everything surrounding that story, but if you had to pick a place to park up in the US for, say five years \u2013 yeah, let\u2019s make it a five-year timeline \u2013 where would you pick at this point? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a tough \u2013 that\u2019s tough. But I mean the obvious choice as a climber would be somewhere like Boulder, Colorado or Salt Lake or Flagstaff or any of the cities that are sort of know- or Las Vegas, actually, places that are known as climbing hubs where you have great outdoor climbing all around them. And I can see living in any of those places if I had to. Or like say, you know, I got married to somebody that lived there or something crazy. Well, I could see being happy in any of those cities. Though honestly, I love Portland too. Though there\u2019s no real climb in there and it\u2019s not a great place to live as a climber and the climate\u2019s terrible with too much rain. But as far as progressive cities go, it\u2019s probably my favorite city in the country. Tim Ferriss: They have Voodoo Donuts too. Not sure if you\u2019re familiar with \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, I\u2019m not \u2013 no, I\u2019ve eaten there and I was like, oh, you know, I didn\u2019t think it was that great though. Tim Ferriss: Not the best. Alex Honnold: Yeah, I was like, I don\u2019t know, I was a little underwhelmed. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Could have been my blood alcohol content at the time. But \u2013 Alex Honnold: Ah yeah. Tim Ferriss: Do you think \u2013 I want to talk about climbing and the ability to climb full time. Because you touched on, I think, a really important point, which is when you began climbing, the prospect of becoming a professional climber just didn\u2019t really exist, right, as a notion. Alex Honnold: Yeah, I mean, there were a handful of professional climbers when I started, but it was like such a small \u2013 there wasn\u2019t like a climbing industry. It was really small. Tim Ferriss: Right, exactly. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And you have a reputation for \u2013 or you\u2019re well known for living as \u2013 and this is a term I hadn\u2019t heard until I watched a documentary that Yvon Chouinard was in, Dirtbag. Alex Honnold: HM Tim Ferriss: So living as a dirtbag climber. Can you describe that? What does that mean, first of all? And what is your version of that? Alex Honnold: Well, so I mean, I guess that just means somebody who \u2013 it\u2019s like a lifestyle kind of. Like somebody who just lives to climb, so it\u2019s like the full time on the road, you know, doing whatever it takes to be a climber I guess. I mean, being a dirtbag isn\u2019t a negative thing in the climbing community. Tim Ferriss: Right. Alex Honnold: It\u2019s just like, oh, that guy is committed to the cause. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s the same kind of term for like the surf community or whatever else, you know, people who just like live to go mountain biking or surfing or whatever, you know, taking odd jobs and just like doing their thing just to be able to do their sport as much as they can. Tim Ferriss: And it seems, I remember, years ago I chatted with Steph Davis when I was working on the Four Hour Body. It seems like a very semi-monastic lifestyle. I mean, you\u2019re really dedicated. It makes me think of like the marathon monks in Japan. But instead of, you know, running every day, you\u2019re climbing sort of this itinerate lifestyle. Now you live \u2013 do you currently \u2013 do you still live in a van? Alex Honnold: Yeah. I mostly live in my car. But then I\u2019m overseas a lot more now and then when I\u2019m travelling for work stuff I get put up in hotels or whatever. But yeah, I mean, I\u2019m still focused in the van. Tim Ferriss: What kind of van? Alex Honnold: Well, I just sold my old van, so I lived in the van for nine years, and then I just sold it to one of my cousins, because I was just kind of \u2013 I felt like I sort of outgrew it. So now I have a Dodge ProMaster, which I can stand in, which is a big, big upgrade [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: How tall are you? Alex Honnold: I\u2019m like five-eleven. Tim Ferriss: So how have you kitted out this van to be suited to your needs? Alex Honnold: Well, so I actually just left it with a friend of mine who built it out while I was on an expedition in Patagonia this winter. And so he just made it nice. I mean, you know, a super nice bed and like a kitchen and good cabinetry and, you know, a refrigerator. And, yeah, I mean it\u2019s basically a really small apartment. Its super nice. Tim Ferriss: And coming back to the industry. So are there people who criticize the industry of climbing, the sponsor influx? And the reason I bring that up is not because I\u2019m critical, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve seen, for instance in the UFC and MMA when in the very early days it was really unfeasible for people to be professional MMA athletes. And as soon as sponsors came in and you had that sustainability, the level of athleticism and training and competency just went completely through the roof. Alex Honnold: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Is there something similar in climbing? I mean, do you feel \u2013 how do you feel about the so-called climbing industry? Alex Honnold: I mean, I think it\u2019s great. I mean there is obviously criticism. I mean, you can find stuff online for \u2013 you can always find traditionalist and stuff who are like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way it was when I grew up, so I don\u2019t think it should be this way.\u201d Or like, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s corrupting the art of climbing.\u201d Or whatever else. You know, the having corporate money coming into the climbing world is tainting the artistic experience. I mean, whatever. I mean, you know, you can find criticism for it. I think it\u2019s great. I mean, obviously, since I\u2019m making a living from it and I\u2019m able to go climbing all the time, you know. I\u2019m very content with the whole situation. But mostly I just feel like it\u2019s sort of a natural outgrowth. I mean, climbing gyms are becoming much more popular because people enjoy climbing. And so if people are into it and the industry is making money, then power to it. Tim Ferriss: Well, it also strikes me as sort of, not self-fulfilling prophecy, but a virtuous cycle in so much as the more people see your exploits, Sharma, people of that caliber, the more they\u2019re inspired to try climbing, the better the gyms do, the more [crosstalk] do you not think that\u2019s the case? Alex Honnold: Well, that might be true a little bit, but I honestly think that part of it is just having the facilities. Like the more good gyms there are in urban centers, the more people just wind up trying it with their friends or whatever.\u00a0 You know, when you have like nice bouldering gym next to a college campus, like everybody tries it. Because it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s sociable, everybody has a good time. And I feel like that sort of like grows the sport. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, the supply helps create the demand. Alex Honnold: Yeah, to some extent. Yeah, I really doubt that any particular climbing film can be responsible for like growing the whole industry. You know, it has more to do with tons of people like going to gyms and trying it and enjoying it and going more often. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I guess it depends a lot on a multitude of factors. I mean, not to belabor the point or the comparison to the MMA world, but like the Ultimate Fighter was kind of the breakthrough for them and then led to a lot of gyms opening. Alex Honnold: Yeah, though climbing has never had anything quite that \u2013 like I don\u2019t follow fighting at all, but I even heard of Ultimate Fighter and that kind of stuff. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: And so I don\u2019t think climbing has really had that, you know, there\u2019s no like big hit reality TV climbing show, you know. Tim Ferriss: No. Alex Honnold: Though, actually, they\u2019re having pitches for that kind of stuff though, which are pretty comical. Tim Ferriss: What? I\u2019d love to see the actual \u2013 it\u2019s aliens meets bouldering or like that. Alex Honnold: There was an ultimate solo thing that got like pitched to me once, and I was like, \u201cDude, you can\u2019t just take random people off the street and like train them how to solo for six weeks and then just like set them off of the big wall.\u201d It\u2019s like, you know. I was like, \u201cYou may as well just have gladiators fighting lions in the pit, you know. It\u2019s like people will literally die on your television show. You don\u2019t want people dying on TV, like.\u201d Tim Ferriss: No, no, no, that\u2019s exactly what we want. Alex Honnold: Well, it\u2019s like, \u201cAre you guys kidding? You know, because you have to insure the show and everything. Like, no one\u2019s going to make this, because like half your contestants are going to die.\u201d Like straight up, that\u2019s so messed up. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. We\u2019ll have some beer some time and talk about exploits in television. But, when you are getting ready to climb something that is going to be challenging \u2013 I\u2019m not saying like a first ascent or something like that, but really anything that you\u2019re expecting to be reasonably challenging, what does your self-talk sound like? What does your \u2013 do you have any sort of prep, anything you ritualistically say to yourself before you get going? Alex Honnold: No, I don\u2019t really \u2013 I don\u2019t self-talk like that. But normally if I\u2019m planning on doing something challenging, I spend the time sort of visualizing what the experience will feel like and what the individual section \u2013 so I mean with climbing there\u2019s a component to it which is memorizing the actual moves. So I\u2019ll think through the sequences and make sure that I remember which foot to move in which order and like how to do everything. And then particularly if it\u2019s the free solo or something, if I\u2019m climbing rope less, then I\u2019ll think through what it\u2019ll feel like to be in certain positions. Because some kinds of movements are insecure and so they\u2019re just like kind of scarier than other types of moves. And so it\u2019s important to me to sort of think through how that will all feel when I\u2019m up there, so that when I\u2019m doing it I won\u2019t suddenly be like, \u201cOh my God, this is really scary.\u201d You know, like I know that it\u2019s supposed to be scary, I know that\u2019s going to be the move, I know what it\u2019s going to feel like and I just do it. Tim Ferriss: So you rehearse the fear, in a sense. Or \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, re- Tim Ferriss: \u2013 rehearse the sensation of one type of which could be fear. Alex Honnold: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and I think through, you know, how airy certain positions will feel, because sometimes you can be all spread out with like the void below you and you\u2019re just like, \u201cWow, this is like quite the air around me.\u201d And so it\u2019s good to have like thought about that. And basically to think through all potential things beforehand, so that when you\u2019re up there there\u2019s no like, unexpected thing that happens. Tim Ferriss: You know, we were talking earlier about this odd looking fellow, the white bust over on my counter, who is, for those of you don\u2019t have a visual, is Seneca the Younger, which was a gift. And of course those of you who listen to this podcast a lot know that I\u2019m somewhat obsessed, compelled to read a lot of stoked philosophy and Marcus Aurelius and so on. How would you describe your \u2013 if you had to take a stab at it, I know this is a hard question \u2013 but you\u2019re just like general \u2013 how does your philosophy or philosophies of life and living differ from most people? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019ve never really thought of any comprehensive life philosophy or anything. You know, I don\u2019t feel like I have a particular set of principles that I live by. Though, you know, I suppose I\u2019m pretty minimalistic and you know, I\u2019m leading a fairly simple life. I mean, I guess that\u2019s basically how I live, I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: What are the benefits of living simply to you? Aside from the ease of travel, but I would imagine at this point you could probably travel reasonable easily. Alex Honnold: Well, no, I mean that\u2019s kind of it, is that, yeah, just the ease of living. You know, basically it just cuts away everything except for what I want to be. I mean, because my goal is basically to climb as much as I can. And that\u2019s what I enjoy most in life, is climbing. And so everything else to some extent is a distraction from that. And so, you know, I basically just cut away what I don\u2019t need. Tim Ferriss: See, I heard a story, and this was like a friend of a friend of a friend relaying something they had heard. So we\u2019ll see where this is. Alex Honnold: Yeah, it\u2019s like telephone. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, exactly, so who knows. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But, they told this story about you free climbing. Alex Honnold: Free soloing probably. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s right, free soloing. A big wall where at some point there were some people resting, I don\u2019t know if they were in a \u2013 how do you say it, bivouac. Alex Honnold: A porta ledge maybe? Tim Ferriss: A porta ledge? Alex Honnold: You know, the camp thing that \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Right. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And you kind of ducked your head around the corner like, \u201cHey, can I borrow some chalk?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cUh, sure,\u201d and gave you some chalk and then you were like, \u201cThanks, great.\u201d And just of like continued on your merry way. Has anything like that happened, or is that just \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, no, so that is a real story sort of with some details fudged. Tim Ferriss: Can you tell the story? Alex Honnold: Yeah, so I was soloing the Triple Link up in Yosemite, so I wasn\u2019t free soloing, but I was climbing by myself, so I had a little bit of \u2013 I had a small rope and I have some gear on me. Tim Ferriss: I got it. Because this is an important distinction. So, okay, got it. So solo climbing is just climbing by yourself. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Free soloing means that you\u2019re free climbing and free climbing means using your hands and your feet and not using gear. And so if you\u2019re free soloing it means that you\u2019re climbing with just your hands and your feet by yourself. Like no gear, no anything. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Alex Honnold: But so in this case, I was soloing. So I had gear. And I was soloing the three largest faces in Yosemite in a day. So Mount Watkins, which is like way up at one end of the valley. And I\u2019d done that first. And then I came down and I was climbing the nose of El Capitan through the night. And in the logistical shuffle and the darkness, whatever, I forgot my chalk bag. So, I basically climber the first thousand feet of the nose without a chalk bag. And it was like, which is kind of a bummer, I mean that\u2019s definitely not ideal. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s an understatement. Alex Honnold: And it had actually rained a bunch the day before, so like the bottom pitches, which are lower angles were like fairly wet and I was like constantly trying to dry my hands on my shirt and it was just all kind of scary. And so I got up to this ledge called Dolt Tower, which is about a quarter of the way up the wall, and there were two groups bivied on the ledge. And two of the people were just like passed out and the other two guys were like cooking dinner. And so I pop over the one side of the ledge and I\u2019m like, \u201cUh, hey, so could I borrow chalk bag?\u201d And they were like, \u201cYeah, I guess, like no problem.\u201d And so one of the guys gave me this chalk bag. It was like completely full of like fresh chalk, I was so stoked. And then I took his chalk bag and then I climbed to the top of the route and then I left it like tied to tree on top. And the guy got it back, I met him again later. And yeah, so they got their chalk bag back like four days later. Tim Ferriss: Do you have a particular type of chalk that you like? Alex Honnold: No, but, I mean any chalk feels amazing when you\u2019ve just climbed a thousand feet of wall with like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: And your hands are wet. Alex Honnold: \u2013 wet, you know. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s a story \u2013 and I realize a lot of these questions are kind of out there, but what is a story that your family or parents like to tell about you? Alex Honnold: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll buy us some time and let you think about it. So one that my parents like to tell about me is I was completely infatuated with the Incredible Hulk when Lou Ferrigno was doing the TV show. So I would run into the living when my parents had company and rip the cushions off of the couch and throw them on the floor and yell like the Hulk and run out. So my mom feels like that is some way represents like me in totality. Alex Honnold: That\u2019s characteristic of your \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which I don\u2019t know how to take. But that\u2019s a story that she likes to tell. Anything come to mind? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. I mean, mom likes to talk about how I always was climbing on everything as a kid and how I was such a wild child. Though I honestly feel like she\u2019s kind of like \u2013 she talks about that more now that I am an actual professional climber. You know, I feel like had I become an engineer she would have instead focused on stories of like how I always loved to play with blocks or do whatever. In my whole family we would always tell stories about how I was such a picky eater and how I\u2019d only eat Cheerios and bread and like whatever, just things \u2013 I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: What do you \u2013 we were talking just during the sound check about eating, and I\u2019d like to talk about that for a second. What does your typical breakfast look like? Alex Honnold: Generally \u2013 well, so I\u2019ve kind of gone through two main phases I guess. I used to always do like and egg scramble for breakfast. And now I pretty much always do some kind of Muesli concoction with like fruit and some kind of alternative milk stuff and like flax seed, hemp hearts, like random things, sort of like a wholesome Muesli mix. Tim Ferriss: And then I asked you about lunch and what did you have to say about lunch? Alex Honnold: Yeah, so I rarely eat a lunch per se. I pretty much always just snack for the several hours in the middle of the day. Normally like a couple of pieces of fruit, maybe some nut butter, you know, a bar or two or something. And then I eat like a big dinner. I normally do a pretty big breakfast and a pretty big dinner, and then just snack throughout the rest. Tim Ferriss: Why no lunch? Alex Honnold: Well, the no lunch thing makes sense when you\u2019re up on a wall for the day, or if you\u2019re like out at the cliff or \u2013 it\u2019s just like a bunch of work to take a real meal. Tim Ferriss: So I wasn\u2019t going to get to this immediately, this early \u2013 this is early for me. Alex Honnold: [Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u00a0 But \u2013 what was that? Alex Honnold: I\u2019m always premature. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like my friend when he drives; we call him a premature accelerator. That\u2019s all a separate story. So this is from a friend of mine who\u2019s an elite athlete, very high level female athlete. I\u2019ll ask her main question first. Actually, no. I\u2019ll ask the related question first. So the food. Real hassle. So her question was: what happens if you have to take a shit on the side of a mountain? Meaning like on a wall \u2013 Alex Honnold: Oh, I\u2019ve got so many good pooping stories. Tim Ferriss: Okay, let\u2019s \u2013 Alex Honnold: We could do a whole podcast on poop stories. Tim Ferriss: Well, let\u2019s give them a preview, that could be the round two. But yeah, let\u2019s \u2013 I mean, I was wondering \u2013 as soon as she brought it up I was like, holy shit, yeah! Alex Honnold: Should I go straight to my most epic dump story? Tim Ferriss: Yes, please. Alex Honnold: Okay. So like two years ago, I guess, I was free soloing this route called the Romantic Warrior in the Needles, which is actually a \u2013 Tim Ferriss: The Romantic Warrior? Alex Honnold: Yeah, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s actually one of the most striking granite walls like in the world. It\u2019s this totally beautiful route on this crazy spire. It\u2019s an amazing, amazing route. It\u2019s something I thought about for a long time. And it\u2019s actually quite difficult. And so I was going up there to free solo. It was like kind of a big thing for me and I was [inaudible]. And typically when you get to the base of a free solo like that, if you have to poop at all, like you have to go like then, you know, when you\u2019re at the base. But I just like, I don\u2019t know, it just didn\u2019t quite happen. And so I started climbing and that route, the first 400 feet or so are like pretty moderate terrain, and then it goes into like some pretty extreme terrain for the second 400 feet. And so basically right before I got into the real stuff I was like, \u201cOh, now I really need to shit.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, man.\u201d You know, basically I was like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s about to get real up here and like I \u2013 now I need to poop.\u201d And so I basically hand traversed on this little feature. So I traverse off the route because it\u2019s really poor form to like shit on a route, because obviously people have to climb that. Tim Ferriss: So a hand traverse, meaning you\u2019re just traveling horizontally. Alex Honnold: Yeah, so I sort of just like meandered to the left 20 feet. And this flake that I was hanging off of was like fairly big and I had a backpack on me with like my shoes and some water and some food, random things that you kind of need for going up a long route like that. And I had some TP in it, so I like shoved my backpack into the flake and I just like hung there off of it and basically just took a poop like straight off the wall, just like while hanging. And then, you know, like wiped, tidied up, it\u2019s all good. And then like put my backpack on, traversed back in and then finished the route. Tim Ferriss: So, no, I just want to really dig into this for a second. So, Alex, I\u2019m just like envisioning \u2013 I had bats \u2013 I grew up on Long Island, we\u2019d have these bats that would like crap off of the shingles and we\u2019d be like, \u201cWhere the hell is that from?\u201d Then we\u2019d see the bat kind of perched there. So what\u2019s the technique here? So you\u2019re hanging off this flake, you have your backpack shoved into it. Like legs straight and straddled, are you in like a crouched position? Alex Honnold: Crouched \u2013 semi-seated crouch, you know, pushing away from the wall a bit. Tim Ferriss: And did you go in like out of the bottom of your shorts, or you pull them down? Alex Honnold: No, I just pull my shorts down, just like normal. Tim Ferriss: Okay, like usual. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Alex Honnold: Yeah, I mean, it was actually totally easy. I mean, I\u2019d call it a space dump. Tim Ferriss: Space dump. Alex Honnold: Yeah, a climber would call that like a perfect space dump. Just like taking a dump in a free space and it just disappears. Tim Ferriss: So what other challenges of climbing on big walls, aside from the \u2013 yeah. Alex Honnold: Don\u2019t let that give the wrong idea, because normally you try to like poop in better places, you know, preferably a toilet. Or at least like bury it properly at the base, you know, being responsible about it. But like from time to time that happens, you know. Tim Ferriss: Things happen. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What are other issues that crop up that people might not think of when you\u2019re doing these climbs? Alex Honnold: Well, people frequently ask like, \u201cWhat do you do if you have to pee or whatever?\u201d Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: Because they think \u2013 I mean, I think that people have the wrong impression that free soloing a big wall is just like holding on for dear life the whole time. But there are actually all kinds of little ledges. Like even a ledge the size of say a pizza tray, is big enough for you to stand there comfortably no hands. And so, I mean, that\u2019s an easy place that you could take a leak, you could you know, take a sip of water, you can eat a little bar. And any time I\u2019m on a ledge, say the size of a sofa cushion of something, I\u2019ll basically pop my shoes off and relax my toes for a minute. Because climbing shoes are quite tight, so like your feet start to cramp after a while. I mean, there\u2019s a lot more self-care going on up there than people might think. Tim Ferriss: For that self-care, do you carry any other tools? I mean, like, I don\u2019t know, nail clippers, any particular type of like \u2013 I\u2019m just making this up \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 like lotion or anything? Not that you\u2019d want that on your hands, but \u2013 Alex Honnold: No, no. I mean, I normally just take food, water and then a pair of, say, a pair of shoes so I can walk down afterward. Tim Ferriss: What type of food do you bring with you? Alex Honnold: Typically, I just bring, you know, sports bar type. Tim Ferriss: What kind of sports bar? I\u2019m a little obsessed with details. Alex Honnold: [Inaudible] I don\u2019t know, I mean, I used to be sponsored by Clif Bars, so I\u2019d do like SHOT BLOCKS and ZBARS. I love the ZBARS, the little kids Clif Bars. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: Mostly because they\u2019re kind of half sized, they\u2019re like 100 calories and they basically taste like a cookie, so I can like always eat them, because they\u2019re just kind of delicious. But now I\u2019ve been kind of getting more into like nut butters and things. Though the typical free solos are short enough that you don\u2019t really need like a full hearty meal. You can kind of get by with like a pack of SHOT BLOCKS or like one little \u2013 one sugary thing to just kind of keep you going. It\u2019s on like bigger climbs, like alpinism or something, where you have to take like a lot of, you know, fatty like higher calorie food. Tim Ferriss: So this is actually \u2013 I will be the first person to admit that I actually do not know what alpinism is. But one of the questions that came up, this is from Kelly O\u2019Shea, one of my listeners, is: \u201cAsk Alex about his recent achievements in alpinism. What was it like as someone who\u2019s so accomplished in one discipline to be a beginner again in another type of climbing?\u201d Can you explain what alpinism is and then how you would answer that? Alex Honnold: So alpinism, I guess is basically just climbing bigger mountains or big snowy or icy faces or, you know, granite walls that are also covered with ice. I don\u2019t know, I mean, alpinism is just climbing the things that you see in posters where you\u2019re like, \u201cWhoa, that looks like a big scary mountain.\u201d You know, because I\u2019ve always been more of a rock climber, which is climbing like vertical dry granite walls. Alpinism is like when you do that in more remote places and like you hike across the glacier, you get to the bottom of some huge icy face and then you do all kinds of shenanigans to get to the top. Tim Ferriss: So what mistakes did you make, if any, when first starting that type of climbing? Alex Honnold: Well, so basically \u2013 I mean, I haven\u2019t done a lot of alpinism, and I still \u2013 I can\u2019t ice climb at all. I\u2019ve like never led a pitch of ice, but I\u2019ve actually done a handful of things that are considered like noteworthy alpine ascents now. But it has more to do with choosing like the right partners, because I go with somebody who\u2019s like way more experienced than me, or just someone who has much more of a plan. And then it\u2019s sort of about the division of labor, you know. Like someone who\u2019s good at one thing and then I\u2019m obviously good at the rock climbing component of it. So even though I\u2019m a total beginner with the ice climbing and with all the logistics and the camping and like dealing with living on a glacier, all that kind of stuff is totally new to me, but at least I know how to do the climbing pretty well. So then, you know, you just find the teammate who complements that skill set well and then you can go out and climb all kinds of crazy things. Tim Ferriss: Now, I probably mentioned this in the intro, but just in case I haven\u2019t, for people listening, I\u2019m sitting in my living room \u2013 we are sitting in my living room, and we have a whole like phalanx of people surrounding us because we\u2019re filming this. Now, one of the people here has actually been on the podcast before. So Jimmy Chin, how does your climbing differ most from his? Alex Honnold: Well, Jimmy Chin is predominantly a photographer. So his climbing, it\u2019s not really climbing. It\u2019s mostly just going up behind people to take pictures. But \u2013 I\u2019m talking to you, Jimmy. [Laughter] I mean, but so Jimmy has been classically more of a big wall climber. I mean, Jimmy\u2019s never been like the best free climber, like you know, I mean, he\u2019s not doing one arm pullups on small edges and he\u2019s not like climbing the hardest sport routes, but he\u2019s always been able to like get to the top of big walls and then been able to do that in the mountains, you know, with ice and snow and bad conditions. And so he sort of \u2013 the climbing that\u2019s he\u2019s been good at has been like farther along the spectrum of, you know, big and badass than the type of climbing \u2013 you know, because I grew up in a climbing gym and then sort of gradually extended to like big rock walls. You know, and he sort of started on big rock walls and then extended into the bigger mountains. Tim Ferriss: When you were getting started, just thinking back to say the first 10 years of climbing \u2013 how old are you now? Alex Honnold: I\u2019m 30. Tim Ferriss: Thirty. Alex Honnold: Getting old. Tim Ferriss: I thought I heard your joints creaking. Alex Honnold: Yeah, I know. I feel like it right now. Tim Ferriss: Who were some of your early mentors in climbing? Alex Honnold: I didn\u2019t have a lot of mentors when I \u2013 I mean I kind of just grew up in the gym, just climbing a lot. So I didn\u2019t really have mentors. I mean I definitely had people that I looked up to and people in the climbing community, but that\u2019s just sort of the typical hero worship style, you know. Like Peter Croft was a really prominent soloist from the generation before me and I was like, \u201cOh, Peter\u2019s the man!\u201d And, you know, Chris Sharma obviously was like setting all kinds of world record type things when I was a kid. I was just like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s so amazing.\u201d And Tommy Caldwell was also a big hero, which has been cool because now I get to climb with Tommy as an adult and I\u2019m just like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d I\u2019m still always excited to climb with Tommy. Tim Ferriss: If you were \u2013 so I\u2019m going to take like 20 different questions and hopefully wrap it into one question. And we can take some time on this, but if you were taking a \u2013 let\u2019s just say an athletic [inaudible] beginner, so someone who has never done any climbing, but has a decent athletic background. Twenty, twenty-five years old. And they want to get really good at say bouldering. And you were going to just kind of lay out \u2013 give them advice or train them for like eight weeks. What would you have them do? What would that look like? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d have to think about it a lot, because I mean, particularly with bouldering, it\u2019s sort of \u2013 it\u2019s interesting, so adults are more prone to injury than kids to some extent, and especially with something like bouldering, where it\u2019s really heavy on fingers. Like, basically it\u2019s really easy to injure your fingers and hands, because all the connective tissue and like tendons and ligaments take a very, very long time to strengthen. So I mean there\u2019s no real shortcut to avoiding tendon injury. Whereas an adult, a 25-year-old male would gain muscle mass super-fast, so really quickly they could exceed the capacity of their tendons and then basically just rip their tendons out of their arms. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: You know, and so it\u2019s like one of those things where \u2013 I mean if I was trying to train somebody to be a good rock climber I would focus on movement and technique and footwork and all those kinds of things. But if somebody was like in eight weeks I have to be able to boulder like a certain difficult level, I\u2019d be like, well, I mean, just start like training your fingers and hope that you don\u2019t get injured. But like obviously that\u2019s not a sustainable. Like if you\u2019re trying to be a good climber, that\u2019s not the way to do it. It\u2019s better to start with like the foundation. Tim Ferriss: So if \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the footwork and technique then. Because, I mean, you\u2019ve been to a ton of climbing gyms, I\u2019ve been to Mission Cliffs, I\u2019m not a good climber I would not say. But I can also recognize but not dissect when I see good climbing versus bad climbing, right, where people are just like shaking like a leaf and using all arm strength. What types of advice would you give someone who wanted to do it the right way but they\u2019re like, all right, I want to focus on the right things, what should I really focus on and \u2013 Alex Honnold: I would say the right things are movement and technique. And so like how you move over the rock. It has nothing to do with how well you can hold on or like how hard you pull. It has to do with, you know, knowing where your center mass is and being able to move your body around the right way so you can stay balanced over your feet and you can move yourself upward with your feet. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. How do you conserve energy when you\u2019re climbing? Alex Honnold: Well, I mean, the main \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Leaving out the pizza sized \u2013 pizza boxes ledges and so on. Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, the main way is to save energy or to keep your weight on your feet, which is kind of the same thing, to stay balanced over your feet so that as much weight as possible is on your feet, so you\u2019re just standing. And then to keep your arms straight or to keep all your limbs straight so that you\u2019re handing off your skeleton more than your muscles. Because if you have your arms bent at 90 degrees like a T-rex or something, then you\u2019re like totally engaging your bicep and your lats and you\u2019re getting tired. If you have your arms totally straight, then you\u2019re only engaging just as much muscle as you need to keep your fingers holding on, but everything else is relaxed because you\u2019re handing off your bones. Tim Ferriss: So I want to underscore something you said a little earlier, because a lot of sort of aggressive duded listen to this podcast. Alex Honnold: Aggressive dudes. Tim Ferriss: Aggressive dudes, meaning they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, just slap on a ton of muscle on my arms and like biceps and lats and go crush this bouldering wall.\u201d But you made a really important point. Several. One of which was that if you pack on a lot of muscular strength, you can outstrip your sort of tendon and \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, your connective tissue. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 connective tissues like really quickly. Alex Honnold: Well, particularly as an adult. I mean if you start climbing as a kid, then you gain muscle at sort of the same. You know, that\u2019s what \u2013 yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You\u2019re in like hormonal nirvana as an adolescent. And this is something that also a guy named Chris Sommer, Coach Summer underscored for me. He is the former national gymnastics team coach for men\u2019s. And he was saying that unlike many other sports, like it\u2019s contraindicated to use anabolics in gymnastics, because all you\u2019re going to do is end up rupturing a tendon or a ligament for the same reasons. Alex Honnold: Hm, totally. Yeah, totally the same as climbing. Tim Ferriss: What do you worry about when you go to sleep at night, if anything? Like when you worry before you go to bed, what kind of stuff do you worry about? Alex Honnold: I was like, that\u2019s a quick 180. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: This is going to be \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m full of all sort of weird 90 degree turns. Alex Honnold: Yeah, that\u2019s fine. Yeah, keep listeners on their toes, you know. So that people scrubbing through the podcast get confused. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I don\u2019t want any storyline that they try to skip ahead. Alex Honnold: Yeah, exactly. No, I don\u2019t really worry that much when I sleep. I mean, the stuff that I get stressed about is all like real life stuff with, you know, dealing with email and responding to calls and like, you know, hustling and I don\u2019t know, like doing my taxes. You know, like all the stuff that I\u2019m just like not good at. Tim Ferriss: So let me ask \u2013 this is like partially me turning this into a therapy session for myself. Alex Honnold: Okay. But, just wait now \u2013 oh, for yourself. I was like gonna lay on the sofa here, getting all set. Alex Honnold: That\u2019s usually my second [inaudible] podcast approach would be. Just relax. But the question I\u2019d like to ask is why do this \u2013 when is enough enough to fuel the climbing? Meaning, what do you hope to do with the additional money you make above and beyond what you need to sustain climbing often. Because it\u2019s not \u2013 at a certain point you surpass that pretty easily. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But you\u2019re certainly keeping busy. I mean you have a number of sponsors. You\u2019re tremendously good at what you do. So what do you want to do with that? Alex Honnold: I mean, that is interesting, because \u2013 and I\u2019ve thought about this a lot over the years, because say the first five or seven years that I was living in the van, my overhead\u2019s probably $10 to $15K a year. And I now obviously make a lot more than that through sponsorship and just doing like one commercial or something, you know, I can make many times what I need to live on the road for a long time. And so, you know, part of that \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m obviously saving for retirement, things like that, trying to be responsible with money. And then I\u2019ve also started a foundation where I\u2019ve been giving probably a third of my income now to environmental non-profit things. But yeah, basically \u2013 I mean, honestly the foundation was kind of my response to that kind of stuff, because I was like I just don\u2019t need to make more [inaudible] as it is actually kind of fun to make more. You know, it\u2019s like fun to do the random opportunities, like to do a commercial project or to like give some talk to some interesting company or whatever. I mean, it\u2019s kind of fun to be able to hustle that money like that. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: But then it\u2019s like equally fun to be able to like use that money for something positive, which is, you know, through the foundation, basically. Tim Ferriss: What is the name of the foundation? Alex Honnold: It\u2019s just the Honnold Foundation. Tim Ferriss: Easy to remember. Alex Honnold: Yeah, it\u2019s like kind of douchey, but like it kind of made sense. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s douchey. I think it\u2019s easy to remember and just sensible. So the reason I was asking about the what do you worry about before you go to bed, is because there are people \u2013 I have never seen so many questions about brass balls in my life when I polled my readers for questions for you. And we\u2019ve never had an in-depth conversation, but I know a lot of people say here in Silicon Valley or other folks who give the appearance of being invincible. They never worry about anything and it can be kind of demoralizing for people who feel like they need to be superhuman to achieve good things. And so what I always like to ask people who are spectacularly good at what they do, or did into, is like what challenges they\u2019ve had or what they struggle with. So for those people who say like, that\u2019s guys got everything together, he doesn\u2019t worry about anything, I\u2019m not like that, what are some of the challenges or dark periods that you\u2019ve had, if any come to mind? And if the answer is none, then that\u2019s a fine answer too. Alex Honnold: I\u2019m invincible. No, I mean, well it\u2019s funny you asked me just in the last two months I\u2019ve had two sort of random injuries that are like super annoying, which I hadn\u2019t really had any kind of injuries climbing in years or like every really. But like last month and in April I got a \u2013 I got dropped on a partner, so I got lowered off the end of the rope and I like compression fractured two vertebrae in my back and I was ultra-bruised and so my hips and butt and stuff, it\u2019s \u2013 you know, my back\u2019s been really tight and I\u2019ve been kind of achy. That worked out kind of okay, it was two days before I was supposed to fly to China for a climbing expedition, and so I was like, \u201cWell, all the travel time will sort of be like good rest, I guess.\u201d And the, you know, I got there and I was like a creaky old man. But I actually did manage to climb the thing that we were hoping to do and it all kind of worked out OK in the end. But, you know, there definitely \u2013 it was a little touch and go, because I was like at first when I was going to the airport to fly to China, I couldn\u2019t even lift my duffel bags, because like my back was too sore and everything was too creaky. And then actually just like two days ago I took a weird fall. Well, actually, I took a totally normal fall, but I somehow tweaked my hand in a weird way, and actually you can probably see the back of my right hand. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I was looking at that. Alex Honnold: It\u2019s swollen. Yeah, my right hand is like all messed up right now. And, you know, I mean there\u2019s definitely a lot of uncertainty there. Because, I mean, I can\u2019t even like click the power button my phone without like pretty serious pain with my right hand right now. But, you know, it\u2019s been two days and it\u2019s kind of improving, and you know, we\u2019ll see. Like \u2013 and the thing is the forecast is rain for the next three days, so I\u2019m like, well, I have three days to rest and then, you know, maybe it\u2019ll be OK or maybe it\u2019ll be good enough that I can\u00a0at least work towards some of my other goals for the season and then by the time it\u2019s recovered in say another two weeks, I\u2019ll be like ready to do some of the things I want to do. I mean, we\u2019ll see. Which is kind of how China went. I was like, well, you know, I can at least do all the work towards when I\u2019m trying to climb while I\u2019m crippled. And then by the time it was ready \u2013 by the time I was ready to actually try to climb the route and it was like oh well, I\u2019m actually feeling good enough by now and I able to do it. Tim Ferriss: Do you ever get depressed or have you ever been depressed? Alex Honnold: Yeah. Yeah. No, I think \u2013 I mean, I think I kind of gravitate towards being this somewhat depressed person, I don\u2019t know. Or \u2013 I don\u2019t know actually. Or I\u2019m just sort of like flat. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s dig into that first part and we\u2019ll see what we come up with. So why do you say that you think \u2013 I definitely oscillate to fairly high high\u2019s and reasonably low low\u2019s, and I\u2019ve been trying to take the edge, like that the 20 top \u2013 like the top and bottom 20 percent off those to make it a little more manageable. But, why do you say that you might tend towards \u2013 Alex Honnold: See, I feel like I don\u2019t have any of the highs, and I kind of go from level to like slightly below level of the bag. You know, it\u2019s all like \u2013 it\u2019s all pretty flat I feel like. Tim Ferriss: And does that \u2013 when you \u2013 Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: When you dip, does that \u2013 is that triggered by certain types of things? Or is it just a cycle that comes with time? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. Yeah, maybe it\u2019s just a cycle with time. It\u2019s like sometimes you just feel useless, you know. But, I mean, in some ways though I embrace that as part of the process, because you kind of have to feel like a worthless piece of poop in order to get motivated enough to go do something that makes you feel less useless. But then ultimately that still doesn\u2019t make you feel any less useless. You do it more. Tim Ferriss: So that\u2019s a perfect segue to the main question from the person who asked what you do when you have to take a shit on the side of a wall. Is there or do you ever see a point where you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve accomplished all that you can in climbing? Or is there always a what\u2019s next? Alex Honnold: I think there\u2019s definitely \u2013 you know, I can definitely see a point where I wouldn\u2019t continue pushing. I mean, there is always a what\u2019s next in climbing, and you know, I mean you can always try to improve in some way or like go to new places or do first ascents. Or, I mean, you know, there is always something new to be done in climbing. Though I can definitely see personally a point at which, you know, I\u2019m like, okay, I\u2019m satisfied. Like I\u2019ve done what I needed to do and, you know. Yeah, we\u2019ll see kind of. Though I say, climbing more than most other professional sports has like quite a long career span kind of because of that, because there\u2019s always more you can do with like trips and expeditions and first ascents. And there\u2019s a really creative process to it, you know, as I come up with interesting challenges and just sort of like do things that nobody\u2019s thought of before. And so, you know, I mean, you know, there are professional climbers in their 50s that are still like getting after it like that. Tim Ferriss: When you are about to do a big climb, or just a very strenuous climbing workout, I\u2019m not even sure if you do that anymore, I meant to talk about it, but how do you warm up, if you do? Alex Honnold: I always warm up pretty gently when I can. So just \u2013 I mean it depends on where I am. If I\u2019m in a climbing gym, then I just warm up on a handful of easy routes and then start the harder ones later. I mean for the last month-and-a-half I\u2019ve been stretching like every morning and every night because of the back thing, because how tight my hips and everything feel right now. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: So doing some stretching and some like light exercise to sort of warm up and then, you know. Tim Ferriss: When you can\u2019t climb, let\u2019s just say you\u2019re on the road, what type of exercise do you do? Alex Honnold: I mean I try to still climb when I\u2019m on the road. I mean, there are just so many gyms in different places that you can always do that. But if there\u2019s absolutely nothing, then maybe I\u2019ll run or I\u2019ll go hiking or it kind of depends on what opportunities there are. I mean, I\u2019d rather go mountain biking than other things or I\u2019d rather go skiing if that\u2019s available. But as long as I\u2019m getting some kind of exercise. I mean, even like standup [inaudible] or something. Well, at least I did something today. Tim Ferriss: A lot of recreational climbers deal with, as we\u2019ve touched on earlier, sort of hand issues, wrist issues, elbow issues. Alex Honnold: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m \u2013 I mean, you saw me when you guys arrived today, I had myself wrapped up in this stuff called Voodoo floss, because my elbows are killing me. And how have you seen climbers keep their elbows and joints in good health? Are there any particular approaches that you think have merit? Alex Honnold: No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s like an easy answer to that kind of stuff. I mean I had some elbow issues for a while. Now it\u2019s like eight or nine years ago or something. But I had sort of like chronic elbow pain on and off for almost a year. And then eventually it just sort of resolved. I mean, I think the best way with that kind of stuff is sort of prevention, you know. Like maintain antagonistic muscles and just sort of stay well balanced and everything and just \u2013 and if you start to feel achiness or pain coming on, then to, you know, take the appropriate rest or maybe change your training to some extent or basically just not to let it become a big problem. Because I feel like all those overuse injuries, like once they\u2019re a problem, then it\u2019s like really hard to deal with. Tim Ferriss: So the antagonistic muscles meaning if you\u2019re doing a lot of say like flexor work kind of gripping that you\u2019re going to use like finger extension and wrist extension and so on. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Though I\u2019ve actually never done the whole extension stuff with hands. I don\u2019t have \u2013 but to me antagonist muscles are more like doing pushups or tricep pulls or things to balance out your arms a bit. Because since you do so much pulling, like to be able to do some kind of pushing sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What in your mind separates a great climber from a good climber? And you can answer that however you want. Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. I mean, yeah, I don\u2019t \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Okay, I\u2019ll ask it differently. Who impresses you right now as a climber? Just one of I\u2019m sure many. Alex Honnold: This kid Mark-Andre Leclerc. Tim Ferriss: Marc-Andre Leclerc. Alex Honnold: Yes, the student of this Canadian guy. He\u2019s been doing like all kinds of crazy alpine soloing. You\u2019re just like, whoa! Tim Ferriss: What makes it so crazy? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just like kind of blows my mind a bit. And it\u2019s funny because I actually don\u2019t ice climb or alpine climb at a high enough level to quite understand what he\u2019s doing even. Like so it\u2019s hard for me to probably appreciate just how hard it is. But then a lot of my friends who do climb at a very high level are like, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s messed up.\u201d I\u2019m just like, \u201cYeah, respect.\u201d Like I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: And for those people who want to see visuals on this stuff, we\u2019ll grab some video and links to \u2013 Alex Honnold: And one of the interesting things with Mark-Andre is that I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re like is video for much of the stuff he\u2019s doing. Tim Ferriss: Oh really? Alex Honnold: Yeah, I mean, he\u2019s just going on doing all this crazy stuff. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Alex Honnold: You\u2019re just like \u2013 it\u2019s pretty full on. Tim Ferriss: Well, I will attempt \u2013 Jimmy, you know this guy? You know of him. What in your mind makes him impressive as an alpinist or alpine climber? Alex Honnold: I bet Jimmy hasn\u2019t even heard any of the stuff he\u2019s like recently been doing in the Rockies. It\u2019s like pretty crazy. Jimmy: Yeah, and the stuff he just [inaudible]. Alex Honnold: Yeah, it\u2019s like, so crazy. Jimmy: It\u2019s just \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll repeat for you guys listening. Jimmy: And then like all this is like extraordinarily high and I think that [inaudible] people who [inaudible] every generation is an evolution for professional sport and [inaudible] people coming that like jump a generation. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Jimmy: And I feel like he\u2019s kind of in that space doing things that people weren\u2019t considering. Tim Ferriss: So just to try to paraphrase here, so his commitment level is just next level and he\u2019s sort of pushing everyone else to consider things that haven\u2019t been done. Jimmy: Usually like alpine climbing at that level is [inaudible] and he\u2019s very young. Alex Honnold: Though he does have a ton of experience, really, I mean, you know, because he\u2019s just done so much of it. He\u2019s been doing like a \u2013 Jimmy: But any [inaudible] like normal [inaudible]. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So the commitment level meaning pushing the envelope is usually predicated on experience level, therefore you see some of the older guys doing it. But \u2013 Jimmy: Not even. You\u2019re not seeing the older guys doing it. Alex Honnold: Because they\u2019re all like, \u201cThat\u2019s messed up.\u201d [Crosstalk] Tim Ferriss: On the danger side, this is a question from Paul Jones. So being the first sponsored superstar of free soloing, do you ever have concerns about the influence you could have on young climbers who may not put in the mileage and the training to get to the point where they can do it as safely? Alex Honnold: Yeah, so there are two things. One, I\u2019m definitely not the first superstar or whatever, because there are a bunch of European climbers who are well known for solo and who have, you know, come before me. And even in the US somebody like John Bachar was like super well-known in the 1970s and he was on all kinds of TV programs. There might not have been sponsorship in the same way that we have today, because the industry wasn\u2019t the same, but he was definitely on like the evening news and all kinds of crazy things fee soloing. So, I mean, I\u2019m definitely not the first by any means. And it\u2019s interesting, because, you know, I was obviously a kid who was influenced by that kind of stuff. But then I\u2019ve gone through, you know, years and years of practice or whatever. I kind of feel like soloing is a bit, I don\u2019t know, almost like self-regulating in a way, because the thing is that anybody can watch a video and be like, \u201cI want to do that.\u201d But then as soon as they climb 15 or 20 feet off the ground they start to have a very frank discussion with themselves, like, \u201cDo I really want to do this?\u201d You know, like it suddenly feels very scary. Because I mean, the people have like an overwhelming fear response to the prospect of falling to their death. You know, and so \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I have an overwhelming fear response just watching videos of it. Alex Honnold: Well, yeah, exactly. I mean, that\u2019s kind of the thing, is that hardly anybody see that film and is like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna go and do that.\u201d And then even if they do, once they start trying to do it, I mean, it is actually quite difficult to climb these walls. So it\u2019s not as if some kind can just like wander up and do that. And even if they are strong enough or like well-versed enough in climbing to climb a little bit, then they\u2019re also like, \u201cWow, this is really, really scary. I didn\u2019t expect it to be this scary.\u201d And then they just climb back down. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: So, I mean, you know, I\u2019ve thought a little bit about influencing kids and like, you know, wondering if that\u2019s a bad thing. But in general like you just don\u2019t really see copycat things. Like you see it a lot more in gravity assisted sports or like action sports. So like kayaking or skiing or something, where like anybody can just like up at the top of the cliff and be like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna [inaudible] this cliff and I\u2019m going to stick it and it\u2019s gonna be sick.\u201d You know. And then once they sort of commit and start going, it\u2019s like they\u2019re going of the cliff one way or another. Tim Ferriss: Right. They can start the music, but they can\u2019t turn it off. Alex Honnold: Yeah, exactly. But with climbing it\u2019s like each move that you make upward is like a decision that you\u2019re going to continue going upward. You have to decide over and over, like I want to keep going, I wat to keep going, I want to keep \u2013 and at a certain point you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to keep going. Like I think I wanna go down.\u201d And then you\u2019re just like, \u201cMommy!\u201d You know, and then like, yeah, I mean. Tim Ferriss: Have you ever hit that point when it was \u2013 let\u2019s just say \u2013 Alex Honnold: When I\u2019ve started screaming for mommy? Tim Ferriss: [Inaudible] well, yeah, screaming for mommy or like hundreds of feet up and you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep doing this.\u201d Alex Honnold: Yeah, no, I\u2019ve definitely had a bunch of times soloing where I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not into this. I\u2019m going down. Tim Ferriss: And what happens then? Because I\u2019ve never seen footage of you climbing down. Alex Honnold: \u00a0Well the thing is \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: But that\u2019s kind of a practical thing, is that if you have people that are filming with you, it\u2019s like obviously you\u2019re doing something that you\u2019ve rehearsed or you know a lot about, or it\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s a classic enough route that it\u2019s worthy to film on. Like you have all those epic misadventures on things that like aren\u2019t that well known, that you know, people aren\u2019t climbing all the time. But no, so I\u2019ve had tons of experiences where \u2013 especially when I was younger, I didn\u2019t really know how to read [inaudible] that well, the little maps that show you like where a climbing route goes. So I\u2019d look at it and be like, \u201cOkay, I think I\u2019m climbing that big corner.\u201d And then I\u2019d go up there and be like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t even the right route. Like what the heck and I doing?\u201d And then I\u2019d start like questing way to the left or right being like, \u201cWell maybe if I traverse 200 feet that way, then I\u2019ll get to the real route.\u201d And then you\u2019re like, \u201cOh God, what am I doing.\u201d And then it all starts to go south, you know Tim Ferriss: And then you would climb down. And then it\u2019s [inaudible]. Alex Honnold: Well, or I would like quest over to some other route and escape off of that one. Tim Ferriss: Quest over is just a travers? Alex Honnold: Yeah, or whatever, you know. There have been a couple of routes where I\u2019ve been like \u2013 especially when I was younger and I was like soloing a route and I get up and all of a sudden I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m on a bolted face, but this route isn\u2019t supposed to have bolts.\u201d And then I\u2019m like, \u201cOh no, I\u2019m on the wrong route.\u201d Then you like look over and you see that the real rout you\u2019re supposed to be on is like 100 meters to the right. And then you\u2019re like, \u201cI wonder what route I\u2019m on.\u201d And then you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I hope it\u2019s not hard.\u201d And then you\u2019re suddenly like, \u201cShit!\u201d And then you start like pulling on the bolts, which is cheating. And you\u2019re just like whatever it takes to like get off this wall, you know. And so you\u2019re like pulling on bolts and stepping on bolts and like doing whatever it is to like get to the top. And then later you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I wish I knew how to read the guide book.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Now, so this is a related question from Drew Cordova. So there\u2019s a video that shows Alex climbing El Cap free solo where he said he was freaking out \u2013 Alex Honnold: \u00a0No, so that\u2019s \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Incorrect? Alex Honnold: Well, there are all kinds of incorrect [inaudible], but yeah. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots. Alex Honnold: Yeah, just go on and I\u2019ll remark at the end. Tim Ferriss: Where he\u2019s freaking out on the cliff face at one point. I\u2019d like to know from his perspective what it takes to overcome that fear. Alex Honnold: Okay, so the video clip that he\u2019s referring to, I\u2019m actually free soloing the face at Half Dome, which is a different wall. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: And that\u2019s actually complicated because it shows me standing on this ledge on Half Dome like having a moment, being really scared. But we shot that film like a year after my actual fee solo. So I\u2019d gone out there and soloed it by myself, with nobody around, which is kind of the point of free soloing only. And then we\u2019d gone back and filmed on it. And when we filmed on it, I walked out on that ledge and like had a moment when I was a little bit afraid and then like sorted myself out, turned around and climbed back. But then they used the voice over of me walking about the original experience when I\u2019d actually been free soloing it the year before, where I have like a much more significant moment on the section 100 feet higher, which is actually quite difficult climbing. Because like walking across a ledge is never that scary, you know what I mean? Like, in the grand scheme of rock climbing, like when you\u2019re standing on the ledge, like you\u2019re not scared. It just happened in that case because I was standing face out, which is like a little off balance and a little scary and I was like, \u201cWhoa, this isn\u2019t what I expected.\u201d But it\u2019s not that big a thing. But the actual experience up higher \u2013 it was like one of those things where they caught this moment on film and it kind of went well with the voice-over, sort of like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: [Inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: The magic of [inaudible]. Alex Honnold: Yeah, exactly. And so it made for a great film and it definitely like shares the free solo experience pretty well. It\u2019s one of the things that at first I was like, I was sort of annoyed that it\u2019s not the literal, like this isn\u2019t what happened, but the thing is like nobody\u2019s there when it actually happens, so then it does share the experience pretty well. Tim Ferriss: So in the actual Half Dome experience, when it was scary, even though like you mentioned earlier you\u2019ve kind of rehearsed what it\u2019s going to feel like as you\u2019re going up this route, what do you \u2013 not to belabor this point, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m fascinated by \u2013 what\u2019s going through your head and how do you get through? Alex Honnold: Well, so that particular Half Dome free solo I actually hadn\u2019t rehearsed it that much really. I had sort of intentionally chosen not to rehears the route very much, because I was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s going to take the adventure out of it. I want to just go up there and do it.\u201d Which in retrospect like wasn\u2019t the best idea. But so, yeah, on Half Dome I didn\u2019t \u2013 I hadn\u2019t memorized the sequences. I didn\u2019t really know like exactly what I should do. I just knew that I could do it. And I knew that\u2019s I\u2019d gone out there and I\u2019d done it, it was fine and that I was able to. You know, in retrospect I probably should have spent a little bit more time. And so why I got so scared was I got up to a certain sequence and I basically like didn\u2019t want to trust a specific foothold and I was like, \u201cOh, this feels like my foot\u2019s going to slip and I don\u2019t want to fall.\u201d And then I tried to use some other feet but I was like, \u201cOh, this doesn\u2019t \u2013 these are worse.\u201d And, you know, so you\u2019re standing there hesitating being like, \u201cWhat should I do? What should I do?\u201d And then you start to get all gripped, like, \u201cOh God, what if I can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d And like you\u2019re obviously getting more and more tired as you stand there, your calves are getting pumped. And, you know, yeah, it\u2019s just strong toesing. Tim Ferriss: All right, we\u2019re back in action. So during the little break, we were just talking about some past lives and I was mentioning that I wanted to be a [inaudible] was an illustrator for a period of time paying expenses in college, and had this other weird side gig of bouncing which was terrible because I was always the smallest guy as a bounder. But what are the best and worst jobs that you had prior to climbing? \u00a0 Alex Honnold: I haven\u2019t really had that many jobs. I mean I worked at the climbing gym as a kid, just, you know, cleaning the bathrooms and doing summer camp stuff with kids. And then I worked doing night security at Berkeley for a semester that I was there. I mean, I was only at Berkeley for a year. And so for my second semester there I was doing night security, I was basically just like walking around campus at night getting paid to like look at buildings. Tim Ferriss: When you were at Berkeley, how did you decide to leave? And what was that calculus like; I mean how long did it take you to decide \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, I didn\u2019t decide to just drop out of Berkeley, it was more that I wasn\u2019t really happy there and then my first year at Berkeley I happened to get second at the nationals, and so I got invited to the youth world cup, which was during what would have been my second fall semester. And so I decided to take the semester off and then go do, you know, Youth Worlds and then travel a bit and climb and do whatever. And also my father happened to die the summer after freshman year, and he was part of the pressure for like going to school. Not really pressure, but he just sort of like expected the kids to go to college type thing. And then when he died it also left life insurance money for my sister and I to finish school. And so, you know, that sort of allowed me to not go back to school. And so just kind of a combination of events just led me to take the semester off and then I just like, you know, I\u2019m just taking the next 10 or like 20 semesters off since then. Tim Ferriss: Were you close to your dad? Alex Honnold: I was fairly close to my dad. I mean \u2013 or we weren\u2019t super close in like talking about things and like having deep chats, but he definitely invested a ton of time in me. You know, he took me to the climbing gym all the time. He would drive me all over the state to competitions. You know, he would take me camping, take me outside like, you know, we would be doing family camping trips in the mountains and stuff. So I mean he definitely put a ton of energy into me. Tim Ferriss: Do you \u2013 and I apologize, I don\u2019t know your status \u2013 do you want to get married, have kids? Alex Honnold: Yeah, I think I\u2019d like to have a family someday. Tim Ferriss: So that brings up something that I\u2019ve wanted to talk about and I hesitated to ask in part because I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been asked a million times, but as it relates to mortality, let\u2019s just say that somebody came to you \u2013 so this is kind of two in one \u2013 and they said I have $10 million and I\u2019m going to dedicate it to you but with the following condition. You have to predict how you\u2019re going to die, accurately. And in that case, it goes to the cause of your choosing. So what would you predict and what cause would it go to? Alex Honnold: That\u2019s interesting. And if I predict wrong it just like doesn\u2019t go anywhere. Tim Ferriss: Disappears. Alex Honnold: Poof. Okay. I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think I would predict \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sort of 50-50 between natural causes, just like dying of old age at some point or like climbing accident in the grander scheme of like not necessarily like falling to my death which is what people think with the free soloing. But just the random stuff like, you know, rappelling in the mountains or like being swept by an avalanche or like being hit by a random rock. Because there is a lot of just like random chance \u2013 or not a lot, but there is random chance involved with climbing. \u00a0And just the fact that I am out climbing all the time, like it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if some random thing just happened to me like that. Though I mean that\u2019s kind of the, you know, the price to pay, you know. Like if you\u2019re going to be in those places like there is just a random risk associated with it. So yeah, I mean, I think \u2013 and then the cause I would devote it to. I don\u2019t know, some probably environmental \u2013 I mean basically the stuff that I\u2019m supporting through my foundation, which is you know any kind of environmental project that like improves standard of living. Which has mostly been like off-grid solar projects or like energy access and stuff. \u00a0Tim Ferriss: Off-grid solar and energy access for whom or wherever? Alex Honnold: For like rural communities. I mean, I\u2019ve been supporting a group that does that kind of work in Africa, which, you know, makes sense because folks have no access to energy. And we\u2019ve also been supporting Grid Alternatives here in the States which does like home PV systems for like low income families. Basically it\u2019s just a way to like help, you know, folks that need some help. And it helps the environment, obviously. Tim Ferriss: And just when we took a break we were talking about books and the fact that you read mostly non-fiction. What non-fiction books have had an impact on you? Or that you particularly like? Alex Honnold: I mean, in the last several years, I mean, some of the most noteworthy books I\u2019ve read I guess, like A People\u2019s History of the US, the Howard Zinn book totally changed the way I look at politics. And then in the same way I read a book recently called Sacred Economics that like totally changed the way I looked at economics. Tim Ferriss: Sacred Economics. Alex Honnold: Yeah, it was actually totally interesting. I forget who the author was now though. I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: I will. We\u2019ll look it up and put it in the show notes. Alex Honnold: Sacred Economics is like kind of awesome. It like, yeah, changed my world a bit. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the kind of basic thesis of Sacred Economics, or is it \u2013 Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know what the author would say about the thesis, but the things that I took away from it were \u2013 well, I mean, basically he\u2019s sort of envisioning different systems for like a more just kind of economics, you know. Because I mean our current style of capitalism basically just concentrates wealth in the hands of the already wealthy. You know, and that\u2019s kind of like by definition the way interest rates work and stuff. Like if you have a lot you\u2019ll just continue to make a lot. And that\u2019s not a fundamentally fair system, because if you don\u2019t have anything, you continue having nothing. But if you already have more than you need, you just get more and more and more. And that\u2019s just like not the way the world should work, I don\u2019t think.\u00a0 Or at least I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know. So one of the ideas that he throws out in the book, which I found totally interesting, was like negative interest rates. So like if you have a lot it basically just like slowly dwindles away unless you\u2019re actively using it for things like investing it into things. So, you know, just by having a lot of money is not going to guarantee that you continue to have a lot of money. Tim Ferriss: Unless you\u2019re allocating it in a certain way. Alex Honnold: Yeah, exactly. Unless you\u2019re using it wisely to like create value. Tim Ferriss: How do you assess risk? Whether that\u2019s with \u2013 and you can focus on one of these \u2013 whether that\u2019s on a particular climb, on like a business venture, a decision to do A versus B, how do you think about risk? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s an interesting question, because obviously I spend a ton of time thinking about risk. But I just don\u2019t have like a clear cut, you know, like I don\u2019t have a clear metrics for like, you know, this is \u2013 and because with the climbing so much of it comes down to a feeling of like I feel a lot of fear when I think about that, obviously it\u2019s not for me. Yeah, I don\u2019t know exactly. And I\u2019ve never really had to evaluate business ventures and things. Tim Ferriss: So let\u2019s touch on something you just said, which is, if you\u2019re very afraid of something, then that\u2019s something that you shouldn\u2019t do. So do you then climb say hard routes in an absence of fear? Or is it present and then you overcome it? Alex Honnold: That\u2019s a good question. I generally climb hard routes in the absence of fear. I generally don\u2019t go up on them unless I feel comfortable and I don\u2019t have that fear. Yes. Though, yeah, though I mean, it\u2019s important to sort of differentiate fear and risk and like all the terms I guess. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Alex Honnold: Because, you know, I mean if there is a high level of risk, I mean you should be feeling fear. I mean fear is sort of that warning that, you know, like that there is real danger. And so like if there is danger present, like I mean you should be feeling fear. And so, you know, and there are times that maybe you should just suppress that fear and go for it anyway, maybe not, I don\u2019t know. But so with the free soloing, typically if I\u2019m feeling a lot of fear, then I just, you know, wait and prepare more, or I don\u2019t know, something, do whatever it takes to mitigate that to like to feel comfortable and then do the climb when I feel comfortable. Tim Ferriss:\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have a \u2013 my suspicion says no \u2013 but do you have a checklist? Like I have to do this with gear x number of times and then do this y number of times before I\u2019m willing to free solo this? Or is it \u2013 Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t have a checklist, but I definitely have a degree of comfort that I need to feel on the route before I\u2019m willing to solo it. Tim Ferriss: What does that feel like? Alex Honnold: Well, it just feels like a certain \u2013 I guess I need to have a certain amount of reserve, I guess. You know, I need to feel like I can climb the route in a variety of conditions and have some extra in the tank just in case, you know. Like if I can climb the route only by the narrowest of like razor thin margins, like then that\u2019s probably not good enough for free soloing. Tim Ferriss: And the definitions point is important. So for instance, I\u2019m involved with a lot of speculative start-ups or start-ups, whether it\u2019s speculative or \u2013 Alex Honnold: They\u2019re all speculative. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I mean, but most of them would be considered very highly speculative. And people say, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really high risk investment. You have a very high risk tolerance, right, doing things in entrepreneurship and so on.\u201d And I\u2019ve never felt that way, I actually like I\u2019m focused on risk mitigation at all times. And so for me I thought about it at one point, because they were like, \u201cOh, you have a really high risk tolerance. Risk, risk, risk.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, wait a second. Like we should try to figure out the definition of this term that we\u2019re using before we have a discussion about it.\u201d Alex Honnold: Well, and isn\u2019t the thing with start-ups is that you\u2019re sort of willing to lose money on a certain number as long as like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Exactly. Alex Honnold: \u2013 some of them come out. Tim Ferriss: No, so exactly, like so I \u2013 Alex Honnold: So you\u2019re sort of just doing the math on the overall picture. It\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t matter is some of them fail. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s exactly right. And what\u2019s important at least in that game, right, is \u2013 or that sport. And you can look at it that way. Is following your own rules. Like if you set rules. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And you understand, say portfolio theory and the math, if I follow these rules is going to turn out likely this way, therefore I need to make x number investments. Alex Honnold: Yeah, or at least have like a plan that you\u2019re willing to stick to. And then not start to just get hog wild where you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, this guy said that you could make money on it.\u201d Tim Ferriss: And not deviate. Yeah, exactly. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what I realized for myself that risk in my mind is the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome. And if I look at it that way, if I do something that fails, if I can get back to where I was very easily, then that\u2019s not a risk. It\u2019s not a high risk, for instance. Do you think you relate to risk or think about it differently than other people? \u00a0 Alex Honnold: No, all that\u2019s pretty much in line with the way I look at risk. I mean, yeah, I mean with the start-up stuff I wouldn\u2019t consider that particularly risky, because like obviously people make a lot of money off start-ups. It\u2019s just a matter of like doing it well. And like, you know, playing the stock market and things like that. People obviously make a lot of money, so it\u2019s not like a fundamentally risky activity. It\u2019s just a matter of like how you do it, how well you do it. And obviously I\u2019m not in either of those worlds. It also \u2013 I mean for me it probably would be dangerous, because, you know I\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, now I have no money.\u201d But it\u2019s because that\u2019s not my thing. Like I don\u2019t know anything about it. Tim Ferriss: What is the best decision you\u2019ve ever made not to do something? Or a good decision that you\u2019ve made not to do something? Alex Honnold: Well, I think pretty much any of the free solos that I backed off of and climbed down were probably all pretty good decisions. I mean, who\u2019s to say. I mean, maybe they all would have been fine and I would have just like climbed to the top and had a nice day. But, you know, [inaudible] on that stuff. Tim Ferriss: Yeah \u2013 Alex Honnold: If you\u2019re not psyched, you\u2019re not psyched. But I haven\u2019t had any like clear \u2013 or like near misses where I decided not to climb something and then there\u2019s like a huge avalanche that sweeps the whole mountain and you\u2019re like, \u201cThank God I wasn\u2019t up there.\u201d Tim Ferriss: You have a very minimalist lifestyle. What is something that you spent too much on, but don\u2019t regret? Or something that you spend too much on but don\u2019t regret? Or a lot on. Too much is too judgmental. Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much, but when I bought noise cancelling headphones I was like, this seems really indulgent, but it made my life so much better. Like, I love traveling with noise cancelling headphones. It\u2019s like my favorite possession. Tim Ferriss: How do you use them? Alex Honnold: Oh just, I mean, I cancel noise with them. Tim Ferriss: [Inaudible]. Do you use them all the time when you\u2019re travelling, or are they like \u2013? Alex Honnold: Like in the airport and on the plane I pretty much have noise cancelling headphones on the whole time. I love it. I\u2019ll just like listen to soft music and like read my book or work on my computer, do whatever. You know, just hang out. But I just like love not having all the crazy bustle-y noise around me the whole time. Tim Ferriss: What type of music do you listen to most often when you\u2019re flying? Alex Honnold: Flying I do a lot of sound tracks. Like sort of like classically type music, but you know, set to Indiana Jones let\u2019s say or whatever. Tim Ferriss: Braveheart. Alex Honnold: Yeah, exactly. Oh yeah, actually I\u2019ve never done the Braveheart sound track. But like the Last Mohicans is a favorite. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a great sound track. Alex Honnold: Great soundtrack. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Do you ever climb to music? Alex Honnold: I\u2019ll do easy climbing to music, for sure. I normally just have my phone in my pocket and will just blast it like, you know, stereo style. But that\u2019s only if I\u2019m climbing something where there\u2019s nobody around. Because I think it\u2019s super annoying when you like hike up to people on a trail with like a boom box going. Because obviously it\u2019s like diminishing their outdoor experience. Tim Ferriss: In those cases, what type of music do you listen to? Alex Honnold: I pretty much only listen to like modern rock. Like [inaudible] rock and stuff. Tim Ferriss: Like what? Alex Honnold: Like what \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what kind of bands? Alex Honnold: Oh, I don\u2019t know, like I was listening to like Bad Religion. We listened to Metallica last time on the drive and like, you know, [inaudible] or like Tool or random, whatever. Tim Ferriss: What is something that people \u2013 and this is in quotes \u2013 \u201cknow\u201d about you that is wrong? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know, I mean I think a lot of people \u2013 I mean certainly online commentary a lot of people think I have a death wish or like have never experienced fear. Like, just don\u2019t care about my safety. I mean, the thing is that if you just watch the YouTube videos, you get the impression that I just like walk up to a wall and climb it. And like, you sort of miss the 20 years of climbing culture that\u2019s behind it. You know, the fact that I\u2019ve \u2013 that there\u2019s a huge history behind all these routes and I know a lot about them, and I have tons of friends that have climbed them. And I can like recite half the moves on them from memory. You know what I mean? Like there\u2019s a ton that goes into it that people like don\u2019t see in the three minute YouTube short. And, you know, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Well, it\u2019s kind of like I had Laird Hamilton on the podcast, right, the sort of undisputed king of big wave surfing. People would \u2013 it\u2019s funny how people look at that and they have a different judgment than when they look at you on a wall. Even though in practical terms \u2013 Alex Honnold: You think? I mean, don\u2019t people look at his big wave surfing and be like, \u201cThat guy\u2019s crazy, he has a death wish?\u201d Because I kind of do. I\u2019m like, that\u2019s [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: So, I think that it\u2019s slightly the frequency with which I hear people say that is different because they look at a wall and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I could climb up things.\u201d But they look at a 100-foot wave and somebody getting towed in on a jet ski and they\u2019re like, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even be able to stand up on the board while getting pulled on a jet ski. Alex Honnold: Hm. Tim Ferriss: Therefore, assumption, assumption, assumption. What do you think of, say, free divers who try to break records in free diving? Alex Honnold: I mean, I don\u2019t know much about it, but it does seem like it\u2019s one of the riskiest sports in the world. I mean, more people die doing that than virtually anything else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: I mean, it kind of goes with wingsuiting or something where like, you know, it\u2019s fair to say that it actually is quite risky because people do actually die all the time doing it. Tim Ferriss: Have you ever done any wing suit stuff? Alex Honnold: No, I did my FF so I like learned how to parachute out of a plane, on the thought that I would maybe eventually learn how to base jump or something. And then I was basically just like, \u201cI\u2019m not into this. I don\u2019t think this is cool. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Just the \u2013 just because the risk, the down side risk \u2013 Alex Honnold: No, I mean \u2013 Tim Ferriss: \u2013 down side is too high? Alex Honnold: No, skydiving is not dangerous, you know, so I mean when you\u2019re leaning out of the plane it\u2019s like not sketchy at all, but mostly I was like I just don\u2019t like this, you know. And like I don\u2019t want to devote the energy to like learning how to do this. And I sort of realized how much it would take for me to feel comfortable doing that. And I was like, this is just dumb, I\u2019m not into it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: And then as it turns out, you know, like one of my good friends and climbing partners died wingsuiting, and then last year notably Dean Potter died wingsuiting. And so, I mean, you know, climbing has lost a lot of high end climbers to wingsuiting accidents. It\u2019s like, you know, I mean it is a very dangerous activity. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned Dean Potter. I think when I hear his name I also associate it with \u2013 Alex Honnold: You think slacklining. Tim Ferriss: Exactly, slacklining. You seem to have like the perfect slacklining feet. I mean maybe we can take a photograph \u2013 Alex Honnold: They\u2019re all messed up. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you\u2019ve got some amazing like \u2013 functional feet. Do you slackline much? Alex Honnold: Functional. That\u2019s a very kind way of putting deformed. Yeah, highly functional, yes. Tim Ferriss: Do you slackline or what\u2019s your [inaudible]? Alex Honnold: No, I can slackline at like a low level. You know, I can like walk lines back and forth. Just because there\u2019s so many slacklines in camp grounds and climbing areas and things, you know, I definitely have done a fair amount of slacklining. And I can do some like really easy tricks and things, but no, I\u2019m definitely not a slackliner and I\u2019ve never done any high lines and I\u2019m not like \u2013 I\u2019m not into slacklining. Tim Ferriss: When you think of the word successful, who\u2019s the first person who comes to mind for you? Alex Honnold: When I hear successful? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, just the word successful. Alex Honnold: I mean, when you just said I thought Elon Musk. But then I\u2019m like, I have no idea, you know, because I don\u2019t know that much about business. But I\u2019m just like, that\u2019s rad. Tim Ferriss: Is there anyone that you would want to model your life after in any way? Alex Honnold: Probably not. Though I do like reading, you know, a biography or something and then sort of \u2013 like I have some notes on my phone of like lists from random things I\u2019ve read, you know, where you sort of choose little lessons out of like a book about somebody and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, like that person did these things well and those are all things that I can apply to my life.\u201d But, you know, I wouldn\u2019t want to model my whole life on somebody. It\u2019s more like, you know, cherry picking the good lesson here and there. Tim Ferriss: Which biographies have produced a lot of notes for you? Or just \u2013 Alex Honnold: I\u2019ve only done this a few times, but so I read the biography of Brad Washburn, who is like a big \u2013 if you know him, he was like an \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I do know him. Alex Honnold: \u2013 [inaudible] photographer. He also ran the like a natural history museum in Boston, I think. But so he just had like a wide and varied career and he was like a National Geographic explorer type. You know, he just did a lot with his life. And so after I finished reading the book I was like, \u201cWhoa, this guy like got shit done.\u201d You know. And, I don\u2019t know, you know, I respect that and so I just like kind of thought about it. Tim Ferriss: What is something that you believe that other people think is crazy? Alex Honnold: That I believe that other people think I crazy? Well, I don\u2019t know, I mean I think that my evaluation of risk and all the things we were just talking about, a lot of people think it\u2019s totally crazy. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: But that\u2019s speaking \u2013 I mean, I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have a full set of facts on it. You know, they don\u2019t quite appreciate it in the same way that I do. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: But I don\u2019t know if I have any other like totally outlandish beliefs like that. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Do you \u2013 I\u2019m sure you have this question before \u2013 but would you consider yourself a religious person? Do you have a particular belief system? Alex Honnold: No, I\u2019m like strongly atheist and just like not into religion at all. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Were your parents religious at all or no? Alex Honnold: Yeah, Mom is \u2013 at least used to identify as Catholic. She probably would still say that she believes in God, though there\u2019s no evidence of it at all. Like she doesn\u2019t go to church anymore or do anything. But, yeah, so as kids we were taken to church. But at no point did I ever believe anything. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Okay, so there was no sort of transitionary period. It was just [crosstalk]. Alex Honnold: No, I know that \u2013 it\u2019s funny, like even though we were being taken to church, I just always thought it was all a bunch of weird stories. It just like made no sense to me. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy would you believe in some invisible thing?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy would you ever believe any of that?\u201d Like it doesn\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s weird that so many adults believe all that stuff, because it still doesn\u2019t make any sense. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s a lot of stuff that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense that people believe too. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: [Inaudible] in the theater of politics and elsewhere too. Alex Honnold: Well, you know. Tim Ferriss: But this is going to be a gear shift. I mean, we\u2019re shifting a lot of gears. I\u2019m grinding out the transmission on gears. But food. I want to talk about do you have any particular thoughts on food? Or how do you think about eating, yourself? Not literally eating yourself, but \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah. I mean I\u2019m not much of a cook and I don\u2019t like love food or food prep or anything. You know, if I could I would just like take a pill and be like fully fed all day every day. And just like, sweet, I don\u2019t have to worry about it. But I don\u2019t know, in the last couple of years I\u2019ve gone vegetarian, which has more to do with like the environmental non-fiction I\u2019ve been reading. It\u2019s more just it\u2019s like one of the few things that I can do as an individual to like really have an impact on the world. But, yeah, I don\u2019t know, I mean. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any go-to dinners? Like what are your most common dinners, what do they look like? Alex Honnold: I mean, for all the years that I\u2019ve lived in the van, one of my go-to dinners was like Mac N Cheese with stuff in it. You know, like adding a vegetable. I used to add tuna to it a lot. Then I switched to just like vegetable or, you know, maybe some beans or whatever. Yeah, like Mac N Cheese and chili. But now I\u2019ve sort of easing away from Mac N Cheese too because I\u2019ve kind of stopped eating dairy. But so like, you know, rice and vegetable stuff or like lentils or whatever. Tim Ferriss: Keeping it simple. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So many questions. So many questions I want to ask. Do you have any morning rituals? Like what are the first 60 days \u2013 60 days \u2013 the first 60 minutes of your day look like? Alex Honnold: I pretty much always just get up and have like a big breakfast and then go climbing. That\u2019s kind of the standard. Tim Ferriss: And when is your usual wake-up? Alex Honnold: For the last two months I\u2019ve been waking up doing some 15 minute of stretching, then eating my breakfast, then going climbing, just because of the back stuff. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: But \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What time do you generally wake up and go to bed? Alex Honnold: I generally \u2013 I\u2019m pretty unstructured, so I basically just go to sleep whenever I need to or whenever it makes sense, then I just wale up whenever. I try to sleep as much as I want to. Tim Ferriss: What does that typically amount \u2013 I mean, people think they\u2019re like, \u201cOh that four-hour work week guy, that guy must sleep three hours a night.\u201d I try to sleep eight to ten. Alex Honnold: Yeah, no, I\u2019m all about the eight to ten, for sure. I think last night \u2013 I mean I was sleeping in front of your house last night. I think I slept nine last night. Well, because \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Okay, wait a second. Is that the van? Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s my car. Tim Ferriss: I just saw it when walking my dog and I was like, who\u2019s camped out in front of my house? Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah, no. Tim Ferriss: That is fucking hilarious. Okay. Yeah, with like the reflectors on the windows. Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah, the reflectors. Tim Ferriss: I was like, who is this trying to kidnap me? Who is this \u2013? Alex Honnold: No, no, that\u2019s my rape wagon parked in front of your house. It\u2019s one of the things like, we drove to San Francisco last night and then I\u2019m like, well, I don\u2019t want to park somewhere else and then have to drive here in the morning. So I\u2019m like, I\u2019m just going to go and park there. I\u2019m going to sleep in as late as possible and I\u2019m gonna wake up and I\u2019m gonna come in and do a podcast. It\u2019s gonna be like totally [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019re right. From \u2013 Alex Honnold: But that\u2019s the thing about living in a car is you\u2019re all about like minimizing the waste of time, you know. There\u2019s no point in like driving around in circles. You just park where you need to be. Sleep, and then do your thing. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s amazing. All right, so \u2013 Alex Honnold: And the thing is, after \u2013 and I\u2019ve lived in the van for like 10 years now. You know, it starts to become a routine. It\u2019s like hard to imagine like going to a hotel, moving all your shit into a room, moving it back into your car later, moving the car. You\u2019re just like, what a waste of time. I just want to like park where I need to be. Tim Ferriss: So a lot of people have asked this, and I\u2019m kind of curious myself. Like the logistics of Alex Honnold. So, if you have a date, and the date goes well, like what then? Alex Honnold: They come back to the van. I mean, it\u2019s a nice van. It\u2019s like a \u2013 you call it a little mini home or whatever. You know, one of the micro home stuff or what\u2019s it called, little \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, tiny houses. Alex Honnold: Yeah, tiny house. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve got a bunch of tiny home books [inaudible]. Alex Honnold: There you go, see, I have one out front. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: A tiny little home. Tim Ferriss: Listen now, before you go out on the date, you\u2019re like just in case this goes well do you put out like some rose petals in a bowl or water? Alex Honnold: No, preferably go back to their place. It\u2019s like a little classier. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any favorite documentaries and movies? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. Not particularly, I guess. I mean, my movie tastes run sort of just straight like Hollywood action movie like total fluff, you know, like Gladiator or something. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: Just like fun times. Like, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Roger. All right. We\u2019ll keep that at that. Alex Honnold: It\u2019s all pretty \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s pretty like unimpressive. But it\u2019s kind of because movies \u2013 because I do a lot of like reading non-fiction and stuff, I feel like movies fill the fluff category. You know, like I hate heavy non-fiction \u2013 or like heavy documentary type films. I just like fall asleep to those. Tim Ferriss: Just too much thinking after all the non-fiction [inaudible]. Alex Honnold: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: What movies have you seen the greatest number of times? Is there anything you\u2019ve watched like over and over again? I have that habit. Alex Honnold: I\u2019ve probably seen the Star Wars movies a lot of times, but that\u2019s partially just because I started when I was a kid and then I\u2019ve like rewatched them over the years. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve seen anything else like more that probably. Tim Ferriss: I think I have maybe weird numbers, because for each of my books I get \u2013 I feel very isolated if I\u2019m writing at night in a dark house by myself. So I always put this \u2013 Alex Honnold: You put on certain movies? Tim Ferriss: I have movies \u2013 for each book there are usually one or two movies that I\u2019ll just put on repeat and I\u2019ll put them on mute and then listen to music. Like, the same tracks over and over and over and over again. Alex Honnold: Your brain might be like hardwired in some weird way too. Tim Ferriss: Well, I gotta \u2013 that\u2019s definitely true. But I gotta \u2013 Alex Honnold: That\u2019s getting tweaky. I like the same music, the same movie. Tim Ferriss: Well, I had a recommendation from this very, very, very brilliant capable entrepreneur in Matt Mullenweg who is a great coder, and he always \u2013 he listens to the same single track over and over again almost like a noise machine when he\u2019s coding. Alex Honnold: Hm. Tim Ferriss: And I thought, okay, well, I\u2019ll try that with writing and it worked really, really well. But the movies ended up being really weird, because \u2013 Alex Honnold: Okay, so what movies are we talking about? Tim Ferriss: So, well, for the Four Hour Work Week it was the \u2013 this isn\u2019t that weird, I think these are fine movies. But the Bourne Identity was the first. And then for the Four Hour Body it was Casino Royale, which I think is a fantastic \u2013 Alex Honnold: I was hoping you were going to say like Rocky or something, so being non-stop training montages. Tim Ferriss: Well, there are a lot of fight scenes, and the Parkour events in the beginning with S\u00e9bastien Foucan, who\u2019s incredible. Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So that\u2019s \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s a whole separate \u2013 Alex Honnold: I didn\u2019t know that was [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: Oh yeah, so good. Alex Honnold: That\u2019s cool. Tim Ferriss: And then for the Four Hour Chef, this is super \u2013 this is off theme completely, but I was just looking for a movie when I was just getting started and on Amazon Prime the first movie that popped up was Babe, with like the little pig. Alex Honnold: With the pig? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Farmer Hoggit. And I watched Babe like a thousand times because I just put it on repeat and watched it like four or five times a night. Alex Honnold: Whoa. Tim Ferriss: Go figure. Yeah, we could psychoanalyze that. Alex Honnold: Hard core. Tim Ferriss: Hard core. Aside from the noise cancelling headphones, what purchase has most positively impacted your life in the last say six months? Alex Honnold: I mean, definitely my van. Tim Ferriss: Definitely your van. Alex Honnold: Yeah, I mean, no question. I mean the last van that I bought, a $10,000 van and lived in it for 10 years. And then this new van that I bought, it\u2019s a new van so it\u2019s obviously a bit pricier, but it\u2019s like pretty awesome and I\u2019ll probably live in it for another ten years. Well, maybe not actually live in it, but, you know, I\u2019ll be based out of it. Tim Ferriss: Again, returning to the \u2013 this is not directly related to the dating and the van, but this is a question from Michael Sipriano. I\u2019ve always found climbing to have a large positive effect on my libido. Does Alex find this to be the case? Alex Honnold: Well, I\u2019ve climbed for my entire life, so I mean maybe it explains \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Just a permanent \u2013 Alex Honnold: \u2013 the tremendous libido. Tim Ferriss: Do you \u2013 Alex Honnold: I mean, is that for real? Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s a real question. Alex Honnold: Okay. I guess, I don\u2019t know. But, I mean, that\u2019s probably true of anybody who\u2019s like staying active and staying fit. You know, you\u2019re just like; it\u2019s the way your body\u2019s supposed to work. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Are there ways that you\u2019ve seen lessons learned or skills developed in climbing translate to other parts of your life? And if so, is there any particular examples that come to mind? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know exac- I mean, so I\u2019ve gained a lot from being a professional climber. Like having to go and give talks and like do the whole works [inaudible] climbing. I mean that\u2019s really like helped me grow as a person and feel comfortable doing public speaking and all that kind of stuff. Though I think from the actual climbing itself, maybe the most useful thing I\u2019ve gotten has been sort of being able to differentiate, you know, risk and consequence and fear and like all these different things, and sort of being able to separate my feelings from what\u2019s actually happening. You know, like, oh I feel fear, but is that fear justified because I\u2019m actually in danger, or is that like totally irrational fear that I should just squish and like move forward with something. And I don\u2019t know, I mean, I feel like climbing has sort of helped me understand like the different things that are going on there. You know, whereas I feel like a lot of people are just like, oh I\u2019m afraid, and then they\u2019re just like, \u201cOh God, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d You know, but sometimes like I mean fear shouldn\u2019t necessarily control you any more than anything else. Tim Ferriss: Desire or fill in the blank. Alex Honnold: Well, yeah, like when you\u2019re really hungry you\u2019re not like, \u201cOh God, I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d You\u2019re just like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll eat lunch in two hours.\u201d You know, and I feel like fear to some extent should be the same way, where you can just register like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m feeling fear right now.\u201d But sometimes that doesn\u2019t matter. I mean sometimes it does, and you need to be like, \u201cOh, you know, I\u2019m about to die. Like, I should watch out for that.\u201d But a lot of the times, I mean, you should be able to just set that fear aside and just do exactly what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so I mean, in a way, I mean, you\u2019re a connoisseur of fear, right. You can distinguish sort of all the different \u2013 Alex Honnold: [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: The varietals of fear. Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah, totally. Tim Ferriss: [inaudible]. Alex Honnold: And yeah, when you experience enough fear in your life you\u2019re like, \u201cOh now I can sort of differentiate between all the different types.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Do you drink coffee or caffeine? Alex Honnold: No. I don\u2019t have \u2013 I just don\u2019t like coffee and I don\u2019t really like tea. But I don\u2019t have any problem with caffeine. I don\u2019t even really notice caffeine I don\u2019t think that much. Because you get it in like SHOT BLOCKS and gels and goo\u2019s and whatever, all the little energy products. Tim Ferriss: Right. Alex Honnold: Like some of them have caffeine and some don\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel like I notice an effect either way. Tim Ferriss: Well, the reason I asked is that I find personally I remember I did a three-day meditation retreat. My first meditation retreat. And they disallowed caffeine. They said no caffeine and no alarm clocks. You wake up when you wake up. Alex Honnold: Welcome to my life. That\u2019s \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It sounds amazing. Alex Honnold: I\u2019m on a 20-year meditation streak. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I need to do more of that. And I came back from that experience and went back into my normal routine, which was drinking not coffee at that point, but a lot of iced tea. Like I\u2019d go to a restaurant, they would just endlessly refill my iced tea, and I felt like a complete crackhead. Like a miserable crackhead. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I was like, is this what my normal was? Holy shit! And the reason that I brought it up is that it strikes me that at least in that state I would have a lot of trouble distinguishing the fine nuances of different types of fear. Alex Honnold: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Because you\u2019re just overwhelmed. Alex Honnold: When you\u2019re all jacked up on sugar from iced tea stuff and then you\u2019re \u2013 yeah, and the caffeine and you know, yeah, totally. There\u2019s like a lot going on physiologically and it\u2019s hard to differentiate like what the finer points are. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, the signal from the noise. Alex Honnold: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: At what climbing grades have you plateaued the most? This is from Liz Wolfe. And she just said 5.11 plateau has been really bad for me. Alex Honnold: Which probably means she\u2019s hasn\u2019t got past the 5.11 plateau. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: She\u2019s just like mired in 5.11 land. No, so I\u2019ve basically \u2013 I pretty much progressed steadily to about mid-5.14. So like 14 a or c and I\u2019ve basically been plateaued there for like seven or ten years or something. Though I feel like I\u2019ve sort of plateaued there because I\u2019m at the point \u2013 I mean, because mid 5.14 is definitely a fairly high level of climbing. Though it\u2019s by no means a lead by the world standard anymore. Like that\u2019s not like super hard. Tim Ferriss: Just to put it in perspective, what would be a \u2013 Alex Honnold: The hardest thing in the world is 15 c. But only two people have climbed that. But there are a lot of people climbing like 15 a and 15 b-ish now. And so climbing like 14 b or c is like, you know, respectable. But a lot of people can do that like first try no pro- not a lot, but a handful of people can climb that first try no problem. It\u2019s like trivial for them. So, you know what I mean, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s by no means world standard. But, you know, it\u2019s solid. But so I think that for me that\u2019s sort of my natural plateau. Like that\u2019s kind of what I can climb without having to train much to climb harder. You know, because the thing is I spend a lot of my year doing like adventure trips and expeditions and, you know, doing stuff through my foundation, going to Angola last year. I mean, trips like that that do not help your fitness at all. Like they won\u2019t help you climb harder. But they definitely make you a more well-rounded climber and probably a better person and more interesting, you get to do fun stuff. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: And so, you know, I\u2019ve sort of been content being plateaued at mid 5.14 for a long time. Though I could see at some point in my life I might devote a year or two to like actually trying to climb harder. Because I\u2019d love to climb the French grade 9 a, which is 14 d in US grades. It\u2019s just sort of like a meaningful benchmark grade. That if I ever climb 9 a I\u2019d be like respect, like I\u2019m good. Like that\u2019s hard enough for me. Tim Ferriss: So if you wanted to do that hard climbing, what would the most important components of that training look like? Alex Honnold: I\u2019m not totally sure. I mean I think for me it would require more finger boarding or hang boarding. Like basically just focusing more on finger strength, because I think as a climber that\u2019s probably what I\u2019m worst at, is just like the pure strength holding on to things. But also I think for me it would just require more dedicated focused hard climbing for the year. You know, like right now I\u2019m climbing Yosemite, and in my whole season of climbing Yosemite I won\u2019t do a single hard move basically at the physical limit of like what I can actually pull on, because I\u2019m climbing these great big walls and I\u2019m trying to climb them quickly and sometimes I\u2019m climbing them ropeless. But anyway, I\u2019m doing them in all these styles that like it just doesn\u2019t help you pull harder. And so like if I wanted to climb harder grades I would have to just pull harder. Tim Ferriss: If you could no longer climb but had to pick a physical activity, what would you pick? Alex Honnold: If I couldn\u2019t climb. I don\u2019t know, I have a lot of respect for ultra-runners. I think because they sort of interact with the landscape in the same way that I kind of like to. You know, something like the ultra-tour of Mont Blanc when you like run all the way around the Mont Blanc massif, I mean that\u2019s pretty cool. And like, I would love to be able to do things like that. But I just like don\u2019t really \u2013 I can\u2019t un that well. But the thing is, is that I really love running like mountain ridge lines and things, and then that quickly becomes actual rock climbing. And so I\u2019m like, well, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know. But yeah, ultra-running is pretty awesome. I don\u2019t know. I could be into like big mountain skiing too. But see it all sort of gravitates back towards mountains. And I\u2019m like, well, that\u2019s basically climbing. Tim Ferriss: And then you get exposed to nasty things like avalanches. For those of you who haven\u2019t seen Marrow \u2013 Jesus, Jimmy. Both of you guys make me sweat. Not that I need any help, I tend to run hot, drinking tea anyway. But I digress. As usual. What do you world class at aside from climbing? Or within climbing that people might not realize? Or how would your best friends answer that question? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know, I mean, I guess within climbing I\u2019d say that \u2013 because I\u2019m known as a free soloist, I\u2019m known for the ropeless climbing and that\u2019s like what you\u2019ll see online and all the videos and all that. But I\u2019d probably still be a professional climber even if I didn\u2019t free solo at all. Like right now I hold the speed record on like pretty much every major formation in Yosemite. With, you know, all the different faces, like all the classic routes. Like I think that\u2019s basically true. And so yeah, I don\u2019t know, I mean, I\u2019d probably still be like one of the more well-rounded climbers in America, even without the free soloing. But it\u2019s all sort of overshadowed by the like, \u201cOh my God, he\u2019s ropeless.\u201d And it\u2019s funny, because I only do, you know a handful of solos a year, if that. And then I spend the whole rest of the year climbing with partners and ropes and like normal climbing with my friends. Just like doing all kinds of interesting things and expeditions and whatever. And yet is till just comes down to like, \u201cWhoa, free soloing,\u201d But, you know, I\u2019m fine with that, because at least I get to go climb all the time. Tim Ferriss: What advice would you give to your 25-year-old self. Twenty-five or twenty, depending on who needed it the most. And if you could just place like what you were doing, where you were at the time? Alex Honnold: Well, 20 is still slightly too old, but like my 18-year-old self, I would just tell to \u2013 I would say to just not bother going to college at all. Because like the year that I spent at Berkeley was a total waste of my time, basically. Not because there\u2019s anything wrong with Berkeley, but because I just wasn\u2019t passionate about what I was studying, and there\u2019s no \u2013 there was no point in me like grinding out a year of studies that I didn\u2019t care about. You know, I should have just like gone climbing. Because, I mean, that\u2019s what I really cared about. And that\u2019s what\u2019s been so funny over the years, is that like with climbing, you know, I have no problem putting in, you know, 20 to 40 hours a week, every week, all year into climbing. Like, and I mean, that\u2019s a fair amount \u2013 I\u2019ve been keeping a training journal. So I have like sort of hours of exercise. And last year I counted up at the New Year and I basically averaged like 27 hours a week of exercise every week last year. Which is, you know, like I think that\u2019s kind of comparable to other \u2013 I mean, you would know more than me, but other sports like for training volume. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Alex Honnold: But I mean, then when you think that I\u2019ve probably been doing that for the last 10 years that I\u2019ve been on the road. And actually, last year was a particularly low volume year for me because I had a book come out, so I did a month of book touring and I was in like a month of touring in South America. And so like, I was climbing much less than I normally would. So presumably a few years ago living in the van I was probably doing like 30, probably 30 or 32 hours a week of exercise. Which is like a lot of time spent climbing. Tim Ferriss: That is a lot of time. What else do you put in your training journal? What other details are in there? Alex Honnold: It\u2019s one line. I do one line, hours of exercise, one line any additional like strength training type stuff or like the stretching I\u2019ve been doing recently. And then one line diet, which is like are well, ate poorly, at so-so, or like, you know, too many cookies like whatever things like that. Tim Ferriss: Do you go back \u2013 do you eat a lot of cookies? Alex Honnold: Sometimes. I have an unfortunate problem. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s your go-to cookie? Alex Honnold: Just like chocolate chip cookies, like straight. I can eat a lot of cookies. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, well, that\u2019s probably the only thing that athletically \u2013 well, that we share in common. Alex Honnold: Oh yeah? Do you go big on the cookies? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. There are these \u2013 Alex Honnold: I see you looking towards your kitchen. Tim Ferriss: Well, I was looking, I have this like secret stash. I have to keep it out of sight. There are these chocolate chip cookies that are actually from Long Island Tates, I think they are. Somebody\u2019s nodding over there. Alex Honnold: What are these, like special imported chocolate chip cookies? Tim Ferriss: Well, originally from Long Island, and they have \u2013 they\u2019re chocolate chip cookies and there are these \u2013 I think they\u2019re gluten free ginger cookies. And I can\u2019t have those in my house or I will demolish the entire thing. Alex Honnold: See that\u2019s my thing with desserts too, is that I don\u2019t really buy dessert much, because if I buy it I\u2019ll just eat it all immediately. Like I\u2019m terrible with moderation. So I generally don\u2019t have any dessert in the van. And then when I do I just eat it all. Tim Ferriss: If you were to \u2013 I know this is a bit of a reach, but \u2013 you\u2019re 30 now, let\u2019s say your idealized 40-year-old self, right, what advice do you think that 40-year-old would give you now? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I feel like I\u2019m doing pretty well right now. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not. Just \u2013 Alex Honnold: Oh. Yeah, no, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I mean, just, you know, just enjoy the ride. Just enjoy the process. Tim Ferriss: What would you like your life to look like in 10 years? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know. I mean, maybe have a family or something, or at least a solid partner, solid something going on. I think I\u2019d like to maybe own a home or like have a place that I\u2019m kind of living. Like more of a solid home base. Just because like living in a van is great, but, you know, at a certain point you\u2019re like, man, it\u2019s nice to have like a bathroom. Having like a shower and things. Tim Ferriss: So how do you deal with that, actually, now that [inaudible] [01:41:49]. Alex Honnold: Well, that\u2019s why when I came into your house I used your bathroom. Tim Ferriss: Oh. Okay. Alex Honnold: That\u2019s it. Tim Ferriss: So like last night, you\u2019re like, oh man, I had too much water. Alex Honnold: Well, I have \u2013 no, I have a pee bottle on me. Like, I\u2019ve used a bottle forever. And actually the thing is, when you get used to using a pee bottle all the time, like when I pull into a grocery store or something, I always just like pee in my bottle before I go in, because you\u2019re like, why would I ever go and find some like dank public bathroom when like I can just use my bottle. Tim Ferriss: So do you have \u2013 is it a disposable pee bottle? Like \u2013 Alex Honnold: No, no, it\u2019s like I use a \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Like a [inaudible]? Alex Honnold: No, I use like a 2-liter bottle, just like some random plastic bottle. And I basically use it over and over until it\u2019s like this is repulsive, and then I recycle it. And then I move on to another. But it\u2019s actually kind of this natural \u2013 it\u2019s like a natural lifecycle. Because I\u2019ll use the same water bottle for climbing, it will just be like some random 2-liter bottle that\u2019s in my bag for like months. But then eventually it starts to get disgusting or just kind of, you know, a little gross and so then well like that becomes the pee bottle and then I get another bottle. It\u2019s like the 4-month cycle on my bottles, you know. Tim Ferriss: Do you label them or do you just know by \u2013 Alex Honnold: No, but \u2013 Tim Ferriss: \u2014 smell. Alex Honnold: Yeah, with the pee bottle you just know. Like, you know, when you open the bottle you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t drink this.\u201d But also I have systems with like where things go. And, you know, I\u2019m never going to accidently like drink my pee bottle. Tim Ferriss: Do people visit you in your van, like hang out in your van, aside from the dates? Alex Honnold: Yeah, no, I mean friends hang out in my van for sure. I mean, a lot of my climbing friends would be staying in a tent normally or staying wherever. So I mean for them it\u2019s a big step up to hang out in the van. It\u2019s like climate controlled, you know, you can \u2013 it\u2019s like sheltered. You can cook on a nice stove, it\u2019s lit. I mean it\u2019s a nice place to hang out in the evenings. Tim Ferriss: If you could have one billboard with anything on it, what would it say? Or what would you put on it? A message to the world. Alex Honnold: Oh, I don\u2019t know. I mean, like, just like, I don\u2019t know, environmental propaganda or something. Or like the meat stuff. I\u2019m like pretty stoked on all the vegetarian type of stuff now, just because it\u2019s such an easy way to minimize your impact on the planet. And it\u2019s just, you know, I mean, it just solves so many different environmental issues. But I don\u2019t know. But the thing is, a bill board is not the best way to say don\u2019t eat meat, because it\u2019s like it\u2019s obviously a lot more complicated than that and nobody\u2019s going to read that and be like, \u201cOh, okay, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Right. Alex Honnold: You know. It\u2019s like, requires \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Requires more of a conversation? Alex Honnold: Yeah, I mean, it requires like a whole \u2013 and even then it\u2019s like it\u2019s not to say that like meat is fundamentally bad. It\u2019s like how you get it, where it\u2019s from, what you\u2019re supporting. I mean, you know, it\u2019s like a whole \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Feed lot versus this versus that. Alex Honnold: Yeah, yeah. I mean, even that\u2019s like really complicated. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Alex Honnold: Because there are places in the world where it makes sense to raise animals, because like you can\u2019t raise anything else. You can\u2019t grow crops, you, you know, whatever and so. Tim Ferriss: What have you changed your mind about in the last few years, if anything? Alex Honnold: I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is like in high school I was reading a bunch of Ayn Rand, like objectivist, all super black and white, basically like f the poor, people should work harder, they should try harder. And now as a 30-year-old I\u2019m basically like all about trying to help the poor or trying to help the planet in different ways. Trying to make the world a better place. It\u2019s like a full 180 from the black and white that I was into in high school. And then, yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve had massive changes on all those kinds of things. I mean, I used to be way more harsh. And like my political views are like way further left now. I\u2019m just way more \u2013 I mean I\u2019m a lot more compassionate now I feel like. Though it\u2019s funny, not so much on a personal level, because I don\u2019t really care. But on like a societal level I\u2019m a lot more compassionate. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s amazing. All right, I can\u2019t let that one go right away. So \u2013 Alex Honnold: Well, because I was like, I can\u2019t self-describe as compassionate, because none of my friends would agree, you know. Because the thing is that I\u2019m not like nice to like my friends. On like a one-on-one level I\u2019m not like a super kind person, I don\u2019t think. But definitely in the grander sense, I mean, I\u2019m trying to make \u2013 I aspire to make the world a better place and like a more just world. Tim Ferriss: Kind of on the macro level. Alex Honnold: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So if I took, say, a couple of your closest friends and gave them a bottle or two of wine, we\u2019re just handing out, how would they describe you? Alex Honnold: I don\u2019t know, I mean, I \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I mean if you had to guess. I mean \u2013 Alex Honnold: I shudder to think. Well, I mean, the thing I\u2019m pretty frank I think, and so people can \u2013 I can kind of be a dick sometimes. Though I just consider that being very honest, you know. Tim Ferriss: Keeping it real. Alex Honnold: Yeah, I\u2019m just keeping it real. Keeping it real. No, I mean, I\u2019d like to think that my friends would still call me a good person, you know, that I\u2019m still like still trying to \u2013 I\u2019m doing my best, you know. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any \u2013 we\u2019re going to wrap up here \u2013 any ask or request for my audience? That could be something you want them to think about, something you would like them to try, something you would like them to do. Alex Honnold: I feel like they\u2019re all MMA fighters and I\u2019d ask them not to beat me up over [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re not all MMA fighters. I assure you. Alex Honnold: \u00a0I don\u2019t know, do something positive in the world, you know. Tim Ferriss: Not a bad place to wrap up. Where can people find more of you online, best place to say hello, see what you\u2019re up to? Alex Honnold: I mean my most personal outlet is probably my Facebook fan page. I\u2019m like constantly posting stuff that I care about. And it\u2019s all managed by me. And so it\u2019s just like me posting articles that I think are interesting. It\u2019s kind of like a combination of the climate stuff that I\u2019m into and then like the environmental stuff that I\u2019m into. Basically I post the environmental stuff is all the stuff I care about, and then I post just enough climate so that everyone doesn\u2019t leave. Tim Ferriss: And is that \u2013 what is the url for that? Alex Honnold: Facebook.com/Alex Honnold, I think. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Alex Honnold: Could it be just search for it, it\u2019s like a fan page; it\u2019s like several hundred thousand people or whatever. Tim Ferriss: H-O-N-N-O-L-D. Alex Honnold: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Well, Alex, I really appreciate you taking the time. I\u2019ve been hoping to meet you for a long time, given that we\u2019re not that far apart oftentimes with Yosemite. Alex Honnold: Yes. It\u2019s surprising. Tim Ferriss: So this has been fun and once I fix my elbows maybe I\u2019ll see if I can tackle a few \u2013 Alex Honnold: Yeah, you should [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: And maybe actually get out of doors, which I would enjoy. Alex Honnold: Right. Tim Ferriss: So yeah, I will hopefully do more than a three-day meditation retreat, given that you\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years. I think I might extend my ambitions a little bit. But thanks very much, I really appreciate it. Alex Honnold: Yeah. No, thanks for having me. A pleasure.

fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "honnold is distinguished for his uncanny ability to control fear while scaling cliffs of dizzying heights without a rope to protect him, and we really dig into that,

have wanted to interview you ever since i first saw footage of you climbing, because i trained long ago at mission cliffs here in san francisco, and did top roping, never have climbed outside except for castle rock, i don\u2019t know if you know it", "yeah, by santa cruz", "exactly", "that\u2019s where i started as a kid, kind of", "really", "yeah, that\u2019s where local area is", "so you grew up in sacramento or am i making that up", "yeah", "yeah, i grew up in sacramento", "and what was your upbringing like", "i mean if you had to describe your childhood, how would you take a stab at it", "just normal, suburban life, you know sacramento, good times", "good times, sac town", "yeah", "i haven\u2019t spent a lot of time there", "i mean mark bell, who\u2019s a buddy, has a gym called super training gym up there", "he\u2019s i think one of the top ten in his weight class of all time", "that is the extent of my exposure to sacramento, is just hanging out with him and feeling really weak", "hm", "which probably would have been the experience if i\u2019d gone climbing with you even in the early days", "what did your parents do", "my parents were both teachers, or professors", "what did they teach", "they taught language", "like, english as a second language in french", "were your parents born in the us or were they elsewhere", "yeah, they were both born in the us, though mom was born to polish immigrants, so that means she\u2019s born in the us and she\u2019s american", "and her parents were actually born here too, but they were like 100 polish, like fresh off the boat, so", "how did you start climbing", "i know it\u2019s probably a story that you\u2019ve told a million times, but how did that begin", "my parents just read about a gym opening in sacramento and they thought i\u2019d like it, so they took me to a climbing gym", "i mean, just like you were saying that mission cliffs, like there was a comparable gym in sacramento, and so i went in there when i was maybe 11 and then just kept going all the time", "what was the first day like", "can you describe \u2013", "like i honestly have no recollection", "i was like an 11-year-old", "and then i probably went to the gym, you know, three to five times a week from 11 to 18, so it\u2019s like it all kind of blurs into like one epic gym session", "did you know in the early days of going to that gym that you had a predisposition to it", "no, not particularly", "i mean, i loved climbing and i loved going in there and just playing all the time and climbing as much as i could", "but i was never like gifted in the way that a lot of people are gifted rock climbers", "and, you know, i wasn\u2019t like winning the competitions or anything", "i did some comps on an off throughout my teenage years, and i never won, you know", "i was never super strong", "but i just like loved climbing all the time", "why do you think you didn\u2019t win", "i mean what \u2013 well, because i wasn\u2019t very strong, you know", "strong \u2013 no, but strong meaning in what capacity", "like, i like to dig into the details with this", "well, like for example, i mean this is kind of getting into the nitty-gritty, but sort of like \u2013 no, that\u2019s what this is about", "okay, here we go", "so chris sharma is like basically has been the best climber in the world for the last 20 years and he was like my hero when i was a kid", "or, you know, he was one of the people i watched videos of and i was like, \u201cthat guy\u2019s the man.\u201d so he\u2019s from santa cruz", "he started climbing when he was 14", "and when he was 15 he put up a route called necessary evil outside of las vegas, and he was like the 14c in the country", "so it was the hardest route in america and he did it after one year of climbing as a 15-year-old", "i mean that\u2019s like a prodigy", "i mean he was like freakishly strong from the get-go", "he could just always pull on really small edges", "he had freakishly strong fingers", "he could do one arm pullups off like anything", "you, like that guy\u2019s gifted", "i was not that guy, you know", "actually, the season i tried to do that route, necessary evil this winter and i totally failed on it", "it\u2019s like i still couldn\u2019t do it", "and i was like, \u201cgod damn, i\u2019ve been climbing for 20 years and i like tried pretty hard, you know, and i still just can\u2019t climb as well as he did after one year.\u201d i still can\u2019t climb as hard", "like, i\u2019m just not as strong as he was after one year", "i mean there are plenty of things that i\u2019m probably better at than he is, you know, it\u2019s all relative technique and everything", "what would some of those things be that you\u2019re better at", "not to necessarily compare you to him, but that you\u2019re very good at", "well, he\u2019s never done any alpine climbing, he\u2019s never really done any big wall, and he\u2019s probably not super-efficient logistically and, you know, but he\u2019s very, very strong and i\u2019m just not strong like that", "but, you know, but i do other types of climbing", "for those people who are not familiar with the world of climbing, could you describe some of the different types", "so the alpine, big wall", "yeah, so climbing is pretty complicated, because it ranges from say, indoor bouldering, which is probably the simplest thing you could possible do, to alpine climbing", "you know, climbing in the himalaya or climbing huge walls around the world", "and so that involves like ice and mixed climbing where you\u2019re using ice tools and crampons and that kind of gear", "and then, you know, there\u2019s big wall climbing, which is basically climbing huge vertical rock walls where you\u2019re on the wall for multiple days", "then there\u2019s \u2013 i mean, there\u2019s just a ton of categories and the bouldering, so for people who don\u2019t know what that is, that\u2019s typically \u2013 it\u2019s no ropes", "yeah, it\u2019s un-roped", "it\u2019s \u2013 i mean an easy way to think of it is practice climbing", "right", "you know, basically you\u2019re practicing movements, so you\u2019re climbing maybe three or four meters, maybe five max", "you know, but you\u2019re climbing small \u2013 small heights that you\u2019re comfortable falling off and landing on a pad, and you\u2019re basically just doing really hard physical moves", "it\u2019s actually an easy way to compare it is to the running world between sprinting and ultra-running or something", "mm-hmm", "like the spectrum of climbing ranges from short and super-intense to super-super long, but obviously low intensity", "mm-hmm", "and i\u2019ve always been more of the low intensity, long distance type of guy", "you know, where some people are just freakishly strong", "and you were attracted to that because of the relative lack of strength, or was there something else that appealed to you about that", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, i think it might just be one of those things that i sort of naturally gravitated towards the thing that suits me", "but i don\u2019t know", "i mean, i think part of it is just that i\u2019ve always loved climbing", "i like doing a lot of rock climbing", "mm-hmm", "and so i\u2019ve always been attracted to high volume", "i mean, i look to like take the routes in my guide book, you know, and be like, \u201coh, i climbed this and i climbed that.\u201d and so i like to climb a lot of routes", "mm-hmm", "yeah", "so it\u2019s just \u2013 yeah, i mean, i just \u2013 i like climbing a lot", "well, i think that is certainly clear", "i wonder what \u2013 what did you think you were going be, or what did you fantasize about becoming when you grew up when you were a kid", "i mean, as a kid i thought i was going to become an engineer or something, you know", "i just thought i would have some normal job", "i mean, when i was growing up there really wasn\u2019t a professional climbing scene", "like you couldn\u2019t really be a professional climber, because the whole climbing industry hadn\u2019t really taken off and there weren\u2019t so many gyms and it was like a different world.\u00a0 so i never thought that i was going to be a climber", "i just thought that i\u2019d have some random job", "you \u2013 now i\u2019m going off the internet here, so that\u2019s a risky business", "yeah", "but you ended up at one point at \u2013 was it uc berkeley", "yeah", "planning to be an engineer", "yeah", "what type of engineering", "i\u2019d applied for civil engineering", "i was going to \u2013 yeah", "why civil", "i mean, basically one of my uncles was a civil engineer", "i was like, that\u2019s cool, you know", "and i loved \u2013 i liked building things and the idea of like building bridges or like big projects like that", "i mean, it\u2019s appealing, you know, the idea of like constructing something cool", "did you collect anything as a kid or do you \u2013 yeah, i was way into legos", "legos, okay", "so no, this is like a theme, right, so", "the kind of large structures, large walls, how long did you collect the legos for", "i mean do you have any idea", "i\u2019m not looking for any timelines here, but", "no", "well, i don\u2019t know when i first started getting legos, but probably when i was really small, and then up until being a teenager basically i had a ton of legos", "did you have any like \u2013 i\u2019m not \u2013 coup de grace is not the right expression here", "i\u2019m looking for like your landmark piece", "is there anything that you remember", "like i had friends who built like the death star out of legos and that was like the pinnacle of their lego career", "no, i mean, i think i had a few just epic forts and like really cool pirate ships and things", "no, but i never constructed anything that was like the culmination of my lego career", "the thing is, i think i took almost as much pleasure in destroying the things afterward, you know, because you create like this elaborate city and then my sister and i would take like a golf ball or something and just like destroy it", "and be like, oh, starting over", "it\u2019s more the process of building it that was so fun", "and do you have one sibling, or do you have more", "yeah, i have an older sister, that\u2019s it", "older sister", "how much older", "two years older", "do you talk to her much", "yeah, we\u2019re good friends", "we chat a fair amount, yeah", "what does she do professionally", "i don\u2019t know", "it\u2019s complicated", "it\u2019s complicated", "she basically just like makes the world a better place", "she\u2019s lived in portland since she went to college there and she\u2019s like vegan and has never owned a car", "she\u2019s like ultra-earth [inaudible]", "and she basically does outdoor participation stuff with kids and it\u2019s kind of like \u2013 i don\u2019t even \u2013 she\u2019s basically getting like at-risk \u2013 it\u2019s like a work program for at-risk youth or, i don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like a \u2013 whole thing", "yeah", "but over the years she\u2019s also been like a middle school teacher and she\u2019s done like bike programs with kids and all kinds of, you know, wholesome things to make the community better", "if you had to pick a fixed location, and we\u2019re definitely going to get to the van and everything surrounding that story, but if you had to pick a place to park up in the us for, say five years \u2013 yeah, let\u2019s make it a five-year timeline \u2013 where would you pick at this point", "i don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a tough \u2013 that\u2019s tough", "but i mean the obvious choice as a climber would be somewhere like boulder, colorado or salt lake or flagstaff or any of the cities that are sort of know- or las vegas, actually, places that are known as climbing hubs where you have great outdoor climbing all around them", "and i can see living in any of those places if i had to", "or like say, you know, i got married to somebody that lived there or something crazy", "well, i could see being happy in any of those cities", "though honestly, i love portland too", "though there\u2019s no real climb in there and it\u2019s not a great place to live as a climber and the climate\u2019s terrible with too much rain", "but as far as progressive cities go, it\u2019s probably my favorite city in the country", "they have voodoo donuts too", "not sure if you\u2019re familiar with \u2013 yeah, i\u2019m not \u2013 no, i\u2019ve eaten there and i was like, oh, you know, i didn\u2019t think it was that great though", "not the best", "yeah, i was like, i don\u2019t know, i was a little underwhelmed", "yeah", "could have been my blood alcohol content at the time", "but \u2013 ah yeah", "do you think \u2013 i want to talk about climbing and the ability to climb full time", "because you touched on, i think, a really important point, which is when you began climbing, the prospect of becoming a professional climber just didn\u2019t really exist, right, as a notion", "yeah, i mean, there were a handful of professional climbers when i started, but it was like such a small \u2013 there wasn\u2019t like a climbing industry", "it was really small", "right, exactly", "yeah", "and you have a reputation for \u2013 or you\u2019re well known for living as \u2013 and this is a term i hadn\u2019t heard until i watched a documentary that yvon chouinard was in, dirtbag", "hm so living as a dirtbag climber", "can you describe that", "what does that mean, first of all", "and what is your version of that", "well, so i mean, i guess that just means somebody who \u2013 it\u2019s like a lifestyle kind of", "like somebody who just lives to climb, so it\u2019s like the full time on the road, you know, doing whatever it takes to be a climber i guess", "i mean, being a dirtbag isn\u2019t a negative thing in the climbing community", "right", "it\u2019s just like, oh, that guy is committed to the cause", "and i\u2019m sure there\u2019s the same kind of term for like the surf community or whatever else, you know, people who just like live to go mountain biking or surfing or whatever, you know, taking odd jobs and just like doing their thing just to be able to do their sport as much as they can", "and it seems, i remember, years ago i chatted with steph davis when i was working on the four hour body", "it seems like a very semi-monastic lifestyle", "i mean, you\u2019re really dedicated", "it makes me think of like the marathon monks in japan", "but instead of, you know, running every day, you\u2019re climbing sort of this itinerate lifestyle", "now you live \u2013 do you currently \u2013 do you still live in a van", "yeah", "i mostly live in my car", "but then i\u2019m overseas a lot more now and then when i\u2019m travelling for work stuff i get put up in hotels or whatever", "but yeah, i mean, i\u2019m still focused in the van", "what kind of van", "well, i just sold my old van, so i lived in the van for nine years, and then i just sold it to one of my cousins, because i was just kind of \u2013 i felt like i sort of outgrew it", "so now i have a dodge promaster, which i can stand in, which is a big, big upgrade [inaudible]", "how tall are you", "i\u2019m like five-eleven", "so how have you kitted out this van to be suited to your needs", "well, so i actually just left it with a friend of mine who built it out while i was on an expedition in patagonia this winter", "and so he just made it nice", "i mean, you know, a super nice bed and like a kitchen and good cabinetry and, you know, a refrigerator", "and, yeah, i mean it\u2019s basically a really small apartment", "its super nice", "and coming back to the industry", "so are there people who criticize the industry of climbing, the sponsor influx", "and the reason i bring that up is not because i\u2019m critical, it\u2019s because i\u2019ve seen, for instance in the ufc and mma when in the very early days it was really unfeasible for people to be professional mma athletes", "and as soon as sponsors came in and you had that sustainability, the level of athleticism and training and competency just went completely through the roof", "mm-hmm", "is there something similar in climbing", "i mean, do you feel \u2013 how do you feel about the so-called climbing industry", "i mean, i think it\u2019s great", "i mean there is obviously criticism", "i mean, you can find stuff online for \u2013 you can always find traditionalist and stuff who are like, \u201cthis isn\u2019t the way it was when i grew up, so i don\u2019t think it should be this way.\u201d or like, \u201ci feel like it\u2019s corrupting the art of climbing.\u201d or whatever else", "you know, the having corporate money coming into the climbing world is tainting the artistic experience", "i mean, whatever", "i mean, you know, you can find criticism for it", "i think it\u2019s great", "i mean, obviously, since i\u2019m making a living from it and i\u2019m able to go climbing all the time, you know", "i\u2019m very content with the whole situation", "but mostly i just feel like it\u2019s sort of a natural outgrowth", "i mean, climbing gyms are becoming much more popular because people enjoy climbing", "and so if people are into it and the industry is making money, then power to it", "well, it also strikes me as sort of, not self-fulfilling prophecy, but a virtuous cycle in so much as the more people see your exploits, sharma, people of that caliber, the more they\u2019re inspired to try climbing, the better the gyms do, the more [crosstalk] do you not think that\u2019s the case", "well, that might be true a little bit, but i honestly think that part of it is just having the facilities", "like the more good gyms there are in urban centers, the more people just wind up trying it with their friends or whatever.\u00a0 you know, when you have like nice bouldering gym next to a college campus, like everybody tries it", "because it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s sociable, everybody has a good time", "and i feel like that sort of like grows the sport", "yeah, the supply helps create the demand", "yeah, to some extent", "yeah, i really doubt that any particular climbing film can be responsible for like growing the whole industry", "you know, it has more to do with tons of people like going to gyms and trying it and enjoying it and going more often", "yeah, i guess it depends a lot on a multitude of factors", "i mean, not to belabor the point or the comparison to the mma world, but like the ultimate fighter was kind of the breakthrough for them and then led to a lot of gyms opening", "yeah, though climbing has never had anything quite that \u2013 like i don\u2019t follow fighting at all, but i even heard of ultimate fighter and that kind of stuff", "yeah", "and so i don\u2019t think climbing has really had that, you know, there\u2019s no like big hit reality tv climbing show, you know", "no", "though, actually, they\u2019re having pitches for that kind of stuff though, which are pretty comical", "what", "i\u2019d love to see the actual \u2013 it\u2019s aliens meets bouldering or like that", "there was an ultimate solo thing that got like pitched to me once, and i was like, \u201cdude, you can\u2019t just take random people off the street and like train them how to solo for six weeks and then just like set them off of the big wall.\u201d it\u2019s like, you know", "i was like, \u201cyou may as well just have gladiators fighting lions in the pit, you know", "it\u2019s like people will literally die on your television show", "you don\u2019t want people dying on tv, like.\u201d no, no, no, that\u2019s exactly what we want", "well, it\u2019s like, \u201care you guys kidding", "you know, because you have to insure the show and everything", "like, no one\u2019s going to make this, because like half your contestants are going to die.\u201d like straight up, that\u2019s so messed up", "yeah", "we\u2019ll have some beer some time and talk about exploits in television", "but, when you are getting ready to climb something that is going to be challenging \u2013 i\u2019m not saying like a first ascent or something like that, but really anything that you\u2019re expecting to be reasonably challenging, what does your self-talk sound like", "what does your \u2013 do you have any sort of prep, anything you ritualistically say to yourself before you get going", "no, i don\u2019t really \u2013 i don\u2019t self-talk like that", "but normally if i\u2019m planning on doing something challenging, i spend the time sort of visualizing what the experience will feel like and what the individual section \u2013 so i mean with climbing there\u2019s a component to it which is memorizing the actual moves", "so i\u2019ll think through the sequences and make sure that i remember which foot to move in which order and like how to do everything", "and then particularly if it\u2019s the free solo or something, if i\u2019m climbing rope less, then i\u2019ll think through what it\u2019ll feel like to be in certain positions", "because some kinds of movements are insecure and so they\u2019re just like kind of scarier than other types of moves", "and so it\u2019s important to me to sort of think through how that will all feel when i\u2019m up there, so that when i\u2019m doing it i won\u2019t suddenly be like, \u201coh my god, this is really scary.\u201d you know, like i know that it\u2019s supposed to be scary, i know that\u2019s going to be the move, i know what it\u2019s going to feel like and i just do it", "so you rehearse the fear, in a sense", "or \u2013 yeah, re- \u2013 rehearse the sensation of one type of which could be fear", "yeah, exactly", "yeah, and i think through, you know, how airy certain positions will feel, because sometimes you can be all spread out with like the void below you and you\u2019re just like, \u201cwow, this is like quite the air around me.\u201d and so it\u2019s good to have like thought about that", "and basically to think through all potential things beforehand, so that when you\u2019re up there there\u2019s no like, unexpected thing that happens", "you know, we were talking earlier about this odd looking fellow, the white bust over on my counter, who is, for those of you don\u2019t have a visual, is seneca the younger, which was a gift", "and of course those of you who listen to this podcast a lot know that i\u2019m somewhat obsessed, compelled to read a lot of stoked philosophy and marcus aurelius and so on", "how would you describe your \u2013 if you had to take a stab at it, i know this is a hard question \u2013 but you\u2019re just like general \u2013 how does your philosophy or philosophies of life and living differ from most people", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, i\u2019ve never really thought of any comprehensive life philosophy or anything", "you know, i don\u2019t feel like i have a particular set of principles that i live by", "though, you know, i suppose i\u2019m pretty minimalistic and you know, i\u2019m leading a fairly simple life", "i mean, i guess that\u2019s basically how i live, i don\u2019t know", "what are the benefits of living simply to you", "aside from the ease of travel, but i would imagine at this point you could probably travel reasonable easily", "well, no, i mean that\u2019s kind of it, is that, yeah, just the ease of living", "you know, basically it just cuts away everything except for what i want to be", "i mean, because my goal is basically to climb as much as i can", "and that\u2019s what i enjoy most in life, is climbing", "and so everything else to some extent is a distraction from that", "and so, you know, i basically just cut away what i don\u2019t need", "see, i heard a story, and this was like a friend of a friend of a friend relaying something they had heard", "so we\u2019ll see where this is", "yeah, it\u2019s like telephone", "yeah, yeah, exactly, so who knows", "yeah", "but, they told this story about you free climbing", "free soloing probably", "i\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s right, free soloing", "a big wall where at some point there were some people resting, i don\u2019t know if they were in a \u2013 how do you say it, bivouac", "a porta ledge maybe", "a porta ledge", "you know, the camp thing that \u2013 right", "yeah", "and you kind of ducked your head around the corner like, \u201chey, can i borrow some chalk?\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cuh, sure,\u201d and gave you some chalk and then you were like, \u201cthanks, great.\u201d and just of like continued on your merry way", "has anything like that happened, or is that just \u2013 yeah, no, so that is a real story sort of with some details fudged", "can you tell the story", "yeah, so i was soloing the triple link up in yosemite, so i wasn\u2019t free soloing, but i was climbing by myself, so i had a little bit of \u2013 i had a small rope and i have some gear on me", "i got it", "because this is an important distinction", "so, okay, got it", "so solo climbing is just climbing by yourself", "yeah", "free soloing means that you\u2019re free climbing and free climbing means using your hands and your feet and not using gear", "and so if you\u2019re free soloing it means that you\u2019re climbing with just your hands and your feet by yourself", "like no gear, no anything", "got it", "but so in this case, i was soloing", "so i had gear", "and i was soloing the three largest faces in yosemite in a day", "so mount watkins, which is like way up at one end of the valley", "and i\u2019d done that first", "and then i came down and i was climbing the nose of el capitan through the night", "and in the logistical shuffle and the darkness, whatever, i forgot my chalk bag", "so, i basically climber the first thousand feet of the nose without a chalk bag", "and it was like, which is kind of a bummer, i mean that\u2019s definitely not ideal", "that\u2019s an understatement", "and it had actually rained a bunch the day before, so like the bottom pitches, which are lower angles were like fairly wet and i was like constantly trying to dry my hands on my shirt and it was just all kind of scary", "and so i got up to this ledge called dolt tower, which is about a quarter of the way up the wall, and there were two groups bivied on the ledge", "and two of the people were just like passed out and the other two guys were like cooking dinner", "and so i pop over the one side of the ledge and i\u2019m like, \u201cuh, hey, so could i borrow chalk bag?\u201d and they were like, \u201cyeah, i guess, like no problem.\u201d and so one of the guys gave me this chalk bag", "it was like completely full of like fresh chalk, i was so stoked", "and then i took his chalk bag and then i climbed to the top of the route and then i left it like tied to tree on top", "and the guy got it back, i met him again later", "and yeah, so they got their chalk bag back like four days later", "do you have a particular type of chalk that you like", "no, but, i mean any chalk feels amazing when you\u2019ve just climbed a thousand feet of wall with like \u2013 and your hands are wet", "\u2013 wet, you know", "yeah", "what\u2019s a story \u2013 and i realize a lot of these questions are kind of out there, but what is a story that your family or parents like to tell about you", "oh, i don\u2019t know", "i\u2019ll buy us some time and let you think about it", "so one that my parents like to tell about me is i was completely infatuated with the incredible hulk when lou ferrigno was doing the tv show", "so i would run into the living when my parents had company and rip the cushions off of the couch and throw them on the floor and yell like the hulk and run out", "so my mom feels like that is some way represents like me in totality", "that\u2019s characteristic of your \u2013 yeah, which i don\u2019t know how to take", "but that\u2019s a story that she likes to tell", "anything come to mind", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, mom likes to talk about how i always was climbing on everything as a kid and how i was such a wild child", "though i honestly feel like she\u2019s kind of like \u2013 she talks about that more now that i am an actual professional climber", "you know, i feel like had i become an engineer she would have instead focused on stories of like how i always loved to play with blocks or do whatever", "in my whole family we would always tell stories about how i was such a picky eater and how i\u2019d only eat cheerios and bread and like whatever, just things \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "what do you \u2013 we were talking just during the sound check about eating, and i\u2019d like to talk about that for a second", "what does your typical breakfast look like", "generally \u2013 well, so i\u2019ve kind of gone through two main phases i guess", "i used to always do like and egg scramble for breakfast", "and now i pretty much always do some kind of muesli concoction with like fruit and some kind of alternative milk stuff and like flax seed, hemp hearts, like random things, sort of like a wholesome muesli mix", "and then i asked you about lunch and what did you have to say about lunch", "yeah, so i rarely eat a lunch per se", "i pretty much always just snack for the several hours in the middle of the day", "normally like a couple of pieces of fruit, maybe some nut butter, you know, a bar or two or something", "and then i eat like a big dinner", "i normally do a pretty big breakfast and a pretty big dinner, and then just snack throughout the rest", "why no lunch", "well, the no lunch thing makes sense when you\u2019re up on a wall for the day, or if you\u2019re like out at the cliff or \u2013 it\u2019s just like a bunch of work to take a real meal", "so i wasn\u2019t going to get to this immediately, this early \u2013 this is early for me", "[inaudible]", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u00a0 but \u2013 what was that", "i\u2019m always premature", "it\u2019s like my friend when he drives; we call him a premature accelerator", "that\u2019s all a separate story", "so this is from a friend of mine who\u2019s an elite athlete, very high level female athlete", "i\u2019ll ask her main question first", "actually, no", "i\u2019ll ask the related question first", "so the food", "real hassle", "so her question was: what happens if you have to take a shit on the side of a mountain", "meaning like on a wall \u2013 oh, i\u2019ve got so many good pooping stories", "okay, let\u2019s \u2013 we could do a whole podcast on poop stories", "well, let\u2019s give them a preview, that could be the round two", "but yeah, let\u2019s \u2013 i mean, i was wondering \u2013 as soon as she brought it up i was like, holy shit, yeah", "should i go straight to my most epic dump story", "yes, please", "okay", "so like two years ago, i guess, i was free soloing this route called the romantic warrior in the needles, which is actually a \u2013 the romantic warrior", "yeah, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s actually one of the most striking granite walls like in the world", "it\u2019s this totally beautiful route on this crazy spire", "it\u2019s an amazing, amazing route", "it\u2019s something i thought about for a long time", "and it\u2019s actually quite difficult", "and so i was going up there to free solo", "it was like kind of a big thing for me and i was [inaudible]", "and typically when you get to the base of a free solo like that, if you have to poop at all, like you have to go like then, you know, when you\u2019re at the base", "but i just like, i don\u2019t know, it just didn\u2019t quite happen", "and so i started climbing and that route, the first 400 feet or so are like pretty moderate terrain, and then it goes into like some pretty extreme terrain for the second 400 feet", "and so basically right before i got into the real stuff i was like, \u201coh, now i really need to shit.\u201d i was like, \u201coh, man.\u201d you know, basically i was like, \u201coh, it\u2019s about to get real up here and like i \u2013 now i need to poop.\u201d and so i basically hand traversed on this little feature", "so i traverse off the route because it\u2019s really poor form to like shit on a route, because obviously people have to climb that", "so a hand traverse, meaning you\u2019re just traveling horizontally", "yeah, so i sort of just like meandered to the left 20 feet", "and this flake that i was hanging off of was like fairly big and i had a backpack on me with like my shoes and some water and some food, random things that you kind of need for going up a long route like that", "and i had some tp in it, so i like shoved my backpack into the flake and i just like hung there off of it and basically just took a poop like straight off the wall, just like while hanging", "and then, you know, like wiped, tidied up, it\u2019s all good", "and then like put my backpack on, traversed back in and then finished the route", "so, no, i just want to really dig into this for a second", "so, alex, i\u2019m just like envisioning \u2013 i had bats \u2013 i grew up on long island, we\u2019d have these bats that would like crap off of the shingles and we\u2019d be like, \u201cwhere the hell is that from?\u201d then we\u2019d see the bat kind of perched there", "so what\u2019s the technique here", "so you\u2019re hanging off this flake, you have your backpack shoved into it", "like legs straight and straddled, are you in like a crouched position", "crouched \u2013 semi-seated crouch, you know, pushing away from the wall a bit", "and did you go in like out of the bottom of your shorts, or you pull them down", "no, i just pull my shorts down, just like normal", "okay, like usual", "yeah", "okay", "yeah, i mean, it was actually totally easy", "i mean, i\u2019d call it a space dump", "space dump", "yeah, a climber would call that like a perfect space dump", "just like taking a dump in a free space and it just disappears", "so what other challenges of climbing on big walls, aside from the \u2013 yeah", "don\u2019t let that give the wrong idea, because normally you try to like poop in better places, you know, preferably a toilet", "or at least like bury it properly at the base, you know, being responsible about it", "but like from time to time that happens, you know", "things happen", "yeah", "what are other issues that crop up that people might not think of when you\u2019re doing these climbs", "well, people frequently ask like, \u201cwhat do you do if you have to pee or whatever?\u201d yeah", "because they think \u2013 i mean, i think that people have the wrong impression that free soloing a big wall is just like holding on for dear life the whole time", "but there are actually all kinds of little ledges", "like even a ledge the size of say a pizza tray, is big enough for you to stand there comfortably no hands", "and so, i mean, that\u2019s an easy place that you could take a leak, you could you know, take a sip of water, you can eat a little bar", "and any time i\u2019m on a ledge, say the size of a sofa cushion of something, i\u2019ll basically pop my shoes off and relax my toes for a minute", "because climbing shoes are quite tight, so like your feet start to cramp after a while", "i mean, there\u2019s a lot more self-care going on up there than people might think", "for that self-care, do you carry any other tools", "i mean, like, i don\u2019t know, nail clippers, any particular type of like \u2013 i\u2019m just making this up \u2013 yeah, yeah", "\u2013 like lotion or anything", "not that you\u2019d want that on your hands, but \u2013 no, no", "i mean, i normally just take food, water and then a pair of, say, a pair of shoes so i can walk down afterward", "what type of food do you bring with you", "typically, i just bring, you know, sports bar type", "what kind of sports bar", "i\u2019m a little obsessed with details", "[inaudible] i don\u2019t know, i mean, i used to be sponsored by clif bars, so i\u2019d do like shot blocks and zbars", "i love the zbars, the little kids clif bars", "mm-hmm", "mostly because they\u2019re kind of half sized, they\u2019re like 100 calories and they basically taste like a cookie, so i can like always eat them, because they\u2019re just kind of delicious", "but now i\u2019ve been kind of getting more into like nut butters and things", "though the typical free solos are short enough that you don\u2019t really need like a full hearty meal", "you can kind of get by with like a pack of shot blocks or like one little \u2013 one sugary thing to just kind of keep you going", "it\u2019s on like bigger climbs, like alpinism or something, where you have to take like a lot of, you know, fatty like higher calorie food", "so this is actually \u2013 i will be the first person to admit that i actually do not know what alpinism is", "but one of the questions that came up, this is from kelly o\u2019shea, one of my listeners, is: \u201cask alex about his recent achievements in alpinism", "what was it like as someone who\u2019s so accomplished in one discipline to be a beginner again in another type of climbing?\u201d can you explain what alpinism is and then how you would answer that", "so alpinism, i guess is basically just climbing bigger mountains or big snowy or icy faces or, you know, granite walls that are also covered with ice", "i don\u2019t know, i mean, alpinism is just climbing the things that you see in posters where you\u2019re like, \u201cwhoa, that looks like a big scary mountain.\u201d you know, because i\u2019ve always been more of a rock climber, which is climbing like vertical dry granite walls", "alpinism is like when you do that in more remote places and like you hike across the glacier, you get to the bottom of some huge icy face and then you do all kinds of shenanigans to get to the top", "so what mistakes did you make, if any, when first starting that type of climbing", "well, so basically \u2013 i mean, i haven\u2019t done a lot of alpinism, and i still \u2013 i can\u2019t ice climb at all", "i\u2019ve like never led a pitch of ice, but i\u2019ve actually done a handful of things that are considered like noteworthy alpine ascents now", "but it has more to do with choosing like the right partners, because i go with somebody who\u2019s like way more experienced than me, or just someone who has much more of a plan", "and then it\u2019s sort of about the division of labor, you know", "like someone who\u2019s good at one thing and then i\u2019m obviously good at the rock climbing component of it", "so even though i\u2019m a total beginner with the ice climbing and with all the logistics and the camping and like dealing with living on a glacier, all that kind of stuff is totally new to me, but at least i know how to do the climbing pretty well", "so then, you know, you just find the teammate who complements that skill set well and then you can go out and climb all kinds of crazy things", "now, i probably mentioned this in the intro, but just in case i haven\u2019t, for people listening, i\u2019m sitting in my living room \u2013 we are sitting in my living room, and we have a whole like phalanx of people surrounding us because we\u2019re filming this", "now, one of the people here has actually been on the podcast before", "so jimmy chin, how does your climbing differ most from his", "well, jimmy chin is predominantly a photographer", "so his climbing, it\u2019s not really climbing", "it\u2019s mostly just going up behind people to take pictures", "but \u2013 i\u2019m talking to you, jimmy", "[laughter] i mean, but so jimmy has been classically more of a big wall climber", "i mean, jimmy\u2019s never been like the best free climber, like you know, i mean, he\u2019s not doing one arm pullups on small edges and he\u2019s not like climbing the hardest sport routes, but he\u2019s always been able to like get to the top of big walls and then been able to do that in the mountains, you know, with ice and snow and bad conditions", "and so he sort of \u2013 the climbing that\u2019s he\u2019s been good at has been like farther along the spectrum of, you know, big and badass than the type of climbing \u2013 you know, because i grew up in a climbing gym and then sort of gradually extended to like big rock walls", "you know, and he sort of started on big rock walls and then extended into the bigger mountains", "when you were getting started, just thinking back to say the first 10 years of climbing \u2013 how old are you now", "i\u2019m 30", "thirty", "getting old", "i thought i heard your joints creaking", "yeah, i know", "i feel like it right now", "who were some of your early mentors in climbing", "i didn\u2019t have a lot of mentors when i \u2013 i mean i kind of just grew up in the gym, just climbing a lot", "so i didn\u2019t really have mentors", "i mean i definitely had people that i looked up to and people in the climbing community, but that\u2019s just sort of the typical hero worship style, you know", "like peter croft was a really prominent soloist from the generation before me and i was like, \u201coh, peter\u2019s the man!\u201d and, you know, chris sharma obviously was like setting all kinds of world record type things when i was a kid", "i was just like, \u201coh, he\u2019s so amazing.\u201d and tommy caldwell was also a big hero, which has been cool because now i get to climb with tommy as an adult and i\u2019m just like, \u201coh, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d i\u2019m still always excited to climb with tommy", "if you were \u2013 so i\u2019m going to take like 20 different questions and hopefully wrap it into one question", "and we can take some time on this, but if you were taking a \u2013 let\u2019s just say an athletic [inaudible] beginner, so someone who has never done any climbing, but has a decent athletic background", "twenty, twenty-five years old", "and they want to get really good at say bouldering", "and you were going to just kind of lay out \u2013 give them advice or train them for like eight weeks", "what would you have them do", "what would that look like", "i don\u2019t know, i\u2019d have to think about it a lot, because i mean, particularly with bouldering, it\u2019s sort of \u2013 it\u2019s interesting, so adults are more prone to injury than kids to some extent, and especially with something like bouldering, where it\u2019s really heavy on fingers", "like, basically it\u2019s really easy to injure your fingers and hands, because all the connective tissue and like tendons and ligaments take a very, very long time to strengthen", "so i mean there\u2019s no real shortcut to avoiding tendon injury", "whereas an adult, a 25-year-old male would gain muscle mass super-fast, so really quickly they could exceed the capacity of their tendons and then basically just rip their tendons out of their arms", "mm-hmm", "you know, and so it\u2019s like one of those things where \u2013 i mean if i was trying to train somebody to be a good rock climber i would focus on movement and technique and footwork and all those kinds of things", "but if somebody was like in eight weeks i have to be able to boulder like a certain difficult level, i\u2019d be like, well, i mean, just start like training your fingers and hope that you don\u2019t get injured", "but like obviously that\u2019s not a sustainable", "like if you\u2019re trying to be a good climber, that\u2019s not the way to do it", "it\u2019s better to start with like the foundation", "so if \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the footwork and technique then", "because, i mean, you\u2019ve been to a ton of climbing gyms, i\u2019ve been to mission cliffs, i\u2019m not a good climber i would not say", "but i can also recognize but not dissect when i see good climbing versus bad climbing, right, where people are just like shaking like a leaf and using all arm strength", "what types of advice would you give someone who wanted to do it the right way but they\u2019re like, all right, i want to focus on the right things, what should i really focus on and \u2013 i would say the right things are movement and technique", "and so like how you move over the rock", "it has nothing to do with how well you can hold on or like how hard you pull", "it has to do with, you know, knowing where your center mass is and being able to move your body around the right way so you can stay balanced over your feet and you can move yourself upward with your feet", "mm-hmm", "how do you conserve energy when you\u2019re climbing", "well, i mean, the main \u2013 leaving out the pizza sized \u2013 pizza boxes ledges and so on", "yeah, yeah", "no, i mean, the main way is to save energy or to keep your weight on your feet, which is kind of the same thing, to stay balanced over your feet so that as much weight as possible is on your feet, so you\u2019re just standing", "and then to keep your arms straight or to keep all your limbs straight so that you\u2019re handing off your skeleton more than your muscles", "because if you have your arms bent at 90 degrees like a t-rex or something, then you\u2019re like totally engaging your bicep and your lats and you\u2019re getting tired", "if you have your arms totally straight, then you\u2019re only engaging just as much muscle as you need to keep your fingers holding on, but everything else is relaxed because you\u2019re handing off your bones", "so i want to underscore something you said a little earlier, because a lot of sort of aggressive duded listen to this podcast", "aggressive dudes", "aggressive dudes, meaning they\u2019re like, \u201chey, just slap on a ton of muscle on my arms and like biceps and lats and go crush this bouldering wall.\u201d but you made a really important point", "several", "one of which was that if you pack on a lot of muscular strength, you can outstrip your sort of tendon and \u2013 yeah, your connective tissue", "\u2013 connective tissues like really quickly", "well, particularly as an adult", "i mean if you start climbing as a kid, then you gain muscle at sort of the same", "you know, that\u2019s what \u2013 yeah", "yeah", "you\u2019re in like hormonal nirvana as an adolescent", "and this is something that also a guy named chris sommer, coach summer underscored for me", "he is the former national gymnastics team coach for men\u2019s", "and he was saying that unlike many other sports, like it\u2019s contraindicated to use anabolics in gymnastics, because all you\u2019re going to do is end up rupturing a tendon or a ligament for the same reasons", "hm, totally", "yeah, totally the same as climbing", "what do you worry about when you go to sleep at night, if anything", "like when you worry before you go to bed, what kind of stuff do you worry about", "i was like, that\u2019s a quick 180", "yeah", "this is going to be \u2013 i\u2019m full of all sort of weird 90 degree turns", "yeah, that\u2019s fine", "yeah, keep listeners on their toes, you know", "so that people scrubbing through the podcast get confused", "yeah, i don\u2019t want any storyline that they try to skip ahead", "yeah, exactly", "no, i don\u2019t really worry that much when i sleep", "i mean, the stuff that i get stressed about is all like real life stuff with, you know, dealing with email and responding to calls and like, you know, hustling and i don\u2019t know, like doing my taxes", "you know, like all the stuff that i\u2019m just like not good at", "so let me ask \u2013 this is like partially me turning this into a therapy session for myself", "okay", "but, just wait now \u2013 oh, for yourself", "i was like gonna lay on the sofa here, getting all set", "that\u2019s usually my second [inaudible] podcast approach would be", "just relax", "but the question i\u2019d like to ask is why do this \u2013 when is enough enough to fuel the climbing", "meaning, what do you hope to do with the additional money you make above and beyond what you need to sustain climbing often", "because it\u2019s not \u2013 at a certain point you surpass that pretty easily", "yeah", "but you\u2019re certainly keeping busy", "i mean you have a number of sponsors", "you\u2019re tremendously good at what you do", "so what do you want to do with that", "i mean, that is interesting, because \u2013 and i\u2019ve thought about this a lot over the years, because say the first five or seven years that i was living in the van, my overhead\u2019s probably $10 to $15k a year", "and i now obviously make a lot more than that through sponsorship and just doing like one commercial or something, you know, i can make many times what i need to live on the road for a long time", "and so, you know, part of that \u2013 i mean, i\u2019m obviously saving for retirement, things like that, trying to be responsible with money", "and then i\u2019ve also started a foundation where i\u2019ve been giving probably a third of my income now to environmental non-profit things", "but yeah, basically \u2013 i mean, honestly the foundation was kind of my response to that kind of stuff, because i was like i just don\u2019t need to make more [inaudible] as it is actually kind of fun to make more", "you know, it\u2019s like fun to do the random opportunities, like to do a commercial project or to like give some talk to some interesting company or whatever", "i mean, it\u2019s kind of fun to be able to hustle that money like that", "mm-hmm", "but then it\u2019s like equally fun to be able to like use that money for something positive, which is, you know, through the foundation, basically", "what is the name of the foundation", "it\u2019s just the honnold foundation", "easy to remember", "yeah, it\u2019s like kind of douchey, but like it kind of made sense", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s douchey", "i think it\u2019s easy to remember and just sensible", "so the reason i was asking about the what do you worry about before you go to bed, is because there are people \u2013 i have never seen so many questions about brass balls in my life when i polled my readers for questions for you", "and we\u2019ve never had an in-depth conversation, but i know a lot of people say here in silicon valley or other folks who give the appearance of being invincible", "they never worry about anything and it can be kind of demoralizing for people who feel like they need to be superhuman to achieve good things", "and so what i always like to ask people who are spectacularly good at what they do, or did into, is like what challenges they\u2019ve had or what they struggle with", "so for those people who say like, that\u2019s guys got everything together, he doesn\u2019t worry about anything, i\u2019m not like that, what are some of the challenges or dark periods that you\u2019ve had, if any come to mind", "and if the answer is none, then that\u2019s a fine answer too", "i\u2019m invincible", "no, i mean, well it\u2019s funny you asked me just in the last two months i\u2019ve had two sort of random injuries that are like super annoying, which i hadn\u2019t really had any kind of injuries climbing in years or like every really", "but like last month and in april i got a \u2013 i got dropped on a partner, so i got lowered off the end of the rope and i like compression fractured two vertebrae in my back and i was ultra-bruised and so my hips and butt and stuff, it\u2019s \u2013 you know, my back\u2019s been really tight and i\u2019ve been kind of achy", "that worked out kind of okay, it was two days before i was supposed to fly to china for a climbing expedition, and so i was like, \u201cwell, all the travel time will sort of be like good rest, i guess.\u201d and the, you know, i got there and i was like a creaky old man", "but i actually did manage to climb the thing that we were hoping to do and it all kind of worked out ok in the end", "but, you know, there definitely \u2013 it was a little touch and go, because i was like at first when i was going to the airport to fly to china, i couldn\u2019t even lift my duffel bags, because like my back was too sore and everything was too creaky", "and then actually just like two days ago i took a weird fall", "well, actually, i took a totally normal fall, but i somehow tweaked my hand in a weird way, and actually you can probably see the back of my right hand", "yeah, i was looking at that", "it\u2019s swollen", "yeah, my right hand is like all messed up right now", "and, you know, i mean there\u2019s definitely a lot of uncertainty there", "because, i mean, i can\u2019t even like click the power button my phone without like pretty serious pain with my right hand right now", "but, you know, it\u2019s been two days and it\u2019s kind of improving, and you know, we\u2019ll see", "like \u2013 and the thing is the forecast is rain for the next three days, so i\u2019m like, well, i have three days to rest and then, you know, maybe it\u2019ll be ok or maybe it\u2019ll be good enough that i can\u00a0at least work towards some of my other goals for the season and then by the time it\u2019s recovered in say another two weeks, i\u2019ll be like ready to do some of the things i want to do", "i mean, we\u2019ll see", "which is kind of how china went", "i was like, well, you know, i can at least do all the work towards when i\u2019m trying to climb while i\u2019m crippled", "and then by the time it was ready \u2013 by the time i was ready to actually try to climb the route and it was like oh well, i\u2019m actually feeling good enough by now and i able to do it", "do you ever get depressed or have you ever been depressed", "yeah", "yeah", "no, i think \u2013 i mean, i think i kind of gravitate towards being this somewhat depressed person, i don\u2019t know", "or \u2013 i don\u2019t know actually", "or i\u2019m just sort of like flat", "let\u2019s dig into that first part and we\u2019ll see what we come up with", "so why do you say that you think \u2013 i definitely oscillate to fairly high high\u2019s and reasonably low low\u2019s, and i\u2019ve been trying to take the edge, like that the 20 top \u2013 like the top and bottom 20 percent off those to make it a little more manageable", "but, why do you say that you might tend towards \u2013 see, i feel like i don\u2019t have any of the highs, and i kind of go from level to like slightly below level of the bag", "you know, it\u2019s all like \u2013 it\u2019s all pretty flat i feel like", "and does that \u2013 when you \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "when you dip, does that \u2013 is that triggered by certain types of things", "or is it just a cycle that comes with time", "i don\u2019t know", "yeah, maybe it\u2019s just a cycle with time", "it\u2019s like sometimes you just feel useless, you know", "but, i mean, in some ways though i embrace that as part of the process, because you kind of have to feel like a worthless piece of poop in order to get motivated enough to go do something that makes you feel less useless", "but then ultimately that still doesn\u2019t make you feel any less useless", "you do it more", "so that\u2019s a perfect segue to the main question from the person who asked what you do when you have to take a shit on the side of a wall", "is there or do you ever see a point where you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve accomplished all that you can in climbing", "or is there always a what\u2019s next", "i think there\u2019s definitely \u2013 you know, i can definitely see a point where i wouldn\u2019t continue pushing", "i mean, there is always a what\u2019s next in climbing, and you know, i mean you can always try to improve in some way or like go to new places or do first ascents", "or, i mean, you know, there is always something new to be done in climbing", "though i can definitely see personally a point at which, you know, i\u2019m like, okay, i\u2019m satisfied", "like i\u2019ve done what i needed to do and, you know", "yeah, we\u2019ll see kind of", "though i say, climbing more than most other professional sports has like quite a long career span kind of because of that, because there\u2019s always more you can do with like trips and expeditions and first ascents", "and there\u2019s a really creative process to it, you know, as i come up with interesting challenges and just sort of like do things that nobody\u2019s thought of before", "and so, you know, i mean, you know, there are professional climbers in their 50s that are still like getting after it like that", "when you are about to do a big climb, or just a very strenuous climbing workout, i\u2019m not even sure if you do that anymore, i meant to talk about it, but how do you warm up, if you do", "i always warm up pretty gently when i can", "so just \u2013 i mean it depends on where i am", "if i\u2019m in a climbing gym, then i just warm up on a handful of easy routes and then start the harder ones later", "i mean for the last month-and-a-half i\u2019ve been stretching like every morning and every night because of the back thing, because how tight my hips and everything feel right now", "mm-hmm", "so doing some stretching and some like light exercise to sort of warm up and then, you know", "when you can\u2019t climb, let\u2019s just say you\u2019re on the road, what type of exercise do you do", "i mean i try to still climb when i\u2019m on the road", "i mean, there are just so many gyms in different places that you can always do that", "but if there\u2019s absolutely nothing, then maybe i\u2019ll run or i\u2019ll go hiking or it kind of depends on what opportunities there are", "i mean, i\u2019d rather go mountain biking than other things or i\u2019d rather go skiing if that\u2019s available", "but as long as i\u2019m getting some kind of exercise", "i mean, even like standup [inaudible] or something", "well, at least i did something today", "a lot of recreational climbers deal with, as we\u2019ve touched on earlier, sort of hand issues, wrist issues, elbow issues", "mm-hmm", "i\u2019m \u2013 i mean, you saw me when you guys arrived today, i had myself wrapped up in this stuff called voodoo floss, because my elbows are killing me", "and how have you seen climbers keep their elbows and joints in good health", "are there any particular approaches that you think have merit", "no, i don\u2019t think there\u2019s like an easy answer to that kind of stuff", "i mean i had some elbow issues for a while", "now it\u2019s like eight or nine years ago or something", "but i had sort of like chronic elbow pain on and off for almost a year", "and then eventually it just sort of resolved", "i mean, i think the best way with that kind of stuff is sort of prevention, you know", "like maintain antagonistic muscles and just sort of stay well balanced and everything and just \u2013 and if you start to feel achiness or pain coming on, then to, you know, take the appropriate rest or maybe change your training to some extent or basically just not to let it become a big problem", "because i feel like all those overuse injuries, like once they\u2019re a problem, then it\u2019s like really hard to deal with", "so the antagonistic muscles meaning if you\u2019re doing a lot of say like flexor work kind of gripping that you\u2019re going to use like finger extension and wrist extension and so on", "yeah", "though i\u2019ve actually never done the whole extension stuff with hands", "i don\u2019t have \u2013 but to me antagonist muscles are more like doing pushups or tricep pulls or things to balance out your arms a bit", "because since you do so much pulling, like to be able to do some kind of pushing sometimes", "mm-hmm", "yeah", "what in your mind separates a great climber from a good climber", "and you can answer that however you want", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, yeah, i don\u2019t \u2013 okay, i\u2019ll ask it differently", "who impresses you right now as a climber", "just one of i\u2019m sure many", "this kid mark-andre leclerc", "marc-andre leclerc", "yes, the student of this canadian guy", "he\u2019s been doing like all kinds of crazy alpine soloing", "you\u2019re just like, whoa", "what makes it so crazy", "i don\u2019t know it\u2019s just like kind of blows my mind a bit", "and it\u2019s funny because i actually don\u2019t ice climb or alpine climb at a high enough level to quite understand what he\u2019s doing even", "like so it\u2019s hard for me to probably appreciate just how hard it is", "but then a lot of my friends who do climb at a very high level are like, \u201cwhoa, that\u2019s messed up.\u201d i\u2019m just like, \u201cyeah, respect.\u201d like i don\u2019t know", "and for those people who want to see visuals on this stuff, we\u2019ll grab some video and links to \u2013 and one of the interesting things with mark-andre is that i don\u2019t know if they\u2019re like is video for much of the stuff he\u2019s doing", "oh really", "yeah, i mean, he\u2019s just going on doing all this crazy stuff", "okay", "you\u2019re just like \u2013 it\u2019s pretty full on", "well, i will attempt \u2013 jimmy, you know this guy", "you know of him", "what in your mind makes him impressive as an alpinist or alpine climber", "i bet jimmy hasn\u2019t even heard any of the stuff he\u2019s like recently been doing in the rockies", "it\u2019s like pretty crazy", "jimmy: yeah, and the stuff he just [inaudible]", "yeah, it\u2019s like, so crazy", "jimmy: it\u2019s just \u2013 i\u2019ll repeat for you guys listening", "jimmy: and then like all this is like extraordinarily high and i think that [inaudible] people who [inaudible] every generation is an evolution for professional sport and [inaudible] people coming that like jump a generation", "yeah", "jimmy: and i feel like he\u2019s kind of in that space doing things that people weren\u2019t considering", "so just to try to paraphrase here, so his commitment level is just next level and he\u2019s sort of pushing everyone else to consider things that haven\u2019t been done", "jimmy: usually like alpine climbing at that level is [inaudible] and he\u2019s very young", "though he does have a ton of experience, really, i mean, you know, because he\u2019s just done so much of it", "he\u2019s been doing like a \u2013 jimmy: but any [inaudible] like normal [inaudible]", "yeah", "so the commitment level meaning pushing the envelope is usually predicated on experience level, therefore you see some of the older guys doing it", "but \u2013 jimmy: not even", "you\u2019re not seeing the older guys doing it", "because they\u2019re all like, \u201cthat\u2019s messed up.\u201d [crosstalk] on the danger side, this is a question from paul jones", "so being the first sponsored superstar of free soloing, do you ever have concerns about the influence you could have on young climbers who may not put in the mileage and the training to get to the point where they can do it as safely", "yeah, so there are two things", "one, i\u2019m definitely not the first superstar or whatever, because there are a bunch of european climbers who are well known for solo and who have, you know, come before me", "and even in the us somebody like john bachar was like super well-known in the 1970s and he was on all kinds of tv programs", "there might not have been sponsorship in the same way that we have today, because the industry wasn\u2019t the same, but he was definitely on like the evening news and all kinds of crazy things fee soloing", "so, i mean, i\u2019m definitely not the first by any means", "and it\u2019s interesting, because, you know, i was obviously a kid who was influenced by that kind of stuff", "but then i\u2019ve gone through, you know, years and years of practice or whatever", "i kind of feel like soloing is a bit, i don\u2019t know, almost like self-regulating in a way, because the thing is that anybody can watch a video and be like, \u201ci want to do that.\u201d but then as soon as they climb 15 or 20 feet off the ground they start to have a very frank discussion with themselves, like, \u201cdo i really want to do this?\u201d you know, like it suddenly feels very scary", "because i mean, the people have like an overwhelming fear response to the prospect of falling to their death", "you know, and so \u2013 i have an overwhelming fear response just watching videos of it", "well, yeah, exactly", "i mean, that\u2019s kind of the thing, is that hardly anybody see that film and is like, \u201coh, i\u2019m gonna go and do that.\u201d and then even if they do, once they start trying to do it, i mean, it is actually quite difficult to climb these walls", "so it\u2019s not as if some kind can just like wander up and do that", "and even if they are strong enough or like well-versed enough in climbing to climb a little bit, then they\u2019re also like, \u201cwow, this is really, really scary", "i didn\u2019t expect it to be this scary.\u201d and then they just climb back down", "mm-hmm", "so, i mean, you know, i\u2019ve thought a little bit about influencing kids and like, you know, wondering if that\u2019s a bad thing", "but in general like you just don\u2019t really see copycat things", "like you see it a lot more in gravity assisted sports or like action sports", "so like kayaking or skiing or something, where like anybody can just like up at the top of the cliff and be like, \u201ci\u2019m gonna [inaudible] this cliff and i\u2019m going to stick it and it\u2019s gonna be sick.\u201d you know", "and then once they sort of commit and start going, it\u2019s like they\u2019re going of the cliff one way or another", "right", "they can start the music, but they can\u2019t turn it off", "yeah, exactly", "but with climbing it\u2019s like each move that you make upward is like a decision that you\u2019re going to continue going upward", "you have to decide over and over, like i want to keep going, i wat to keep going, i want to keep \u2013 and at a certain point you\u2019re like, \u201ci don\u2019t really want to keep going", "like i think i wanna go down.\u201d and then you\u2019re just like, \u201cmommy!\u201d you know, and then like, yeah, i mean", "have you ever hit that point when it was \u2013 let\u2019s just say \u2013 when i\u2019ve started screaming for mommy", "[inaudible] well, yeah, screaming for mommy or like hundreds of feet up and you\u2019re like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to keep doing this.\u201d yeah, no, i\u2019ve definitely had a bunch of times soloing where i\u2019m like, \u201ci\u2019m not into this", "i\u2019m going down", "and what happens then", "because i\u2019ve never seen footage of you climbing down", "\u00a0well the thing is \u2013 yeah", "but that\u2019s kind of a practical thing, is that if you have people that are filming with you, it\u2019s like obviously you\u2019re doing something that you\u2019ve rehearsed or you know a lot about, or it\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s a classic enough route that it\u2019s worthy to film on", "like you have all those epic misadventures on things that like aren\u2019t that well known, that you know, people aren\u2019t climbing all the time", "but no, so i\u2019ve had tons of experiences where \u2013 especially when i was younger, i didn\u2019t really know how to read [inaudible] that well, the little maps that show you like where a climbing route goes", "so i\u2019d look at it and be like, \u201cokay, i think i\u2019m climbing that big corner.\u201d and then i\u2019d go up there and be like, \u201cthis isn\u2019t even the right route", "like what the heck and i doing?\u201d and then i\u2019d start like questing way to the left or right being like, \u201cwell maybe if i traverse 200 feet that way, then i\u2019ll get to the real route.\u201d and then you\u2019re like, \u201coh god, what am i doing.\u201d and then it all starts to go south, you know and then you would climb down", "and then it\u2019s [inaudible]", "well, or i would like quest over to some other route and escape off of that one", "quest over is just a travers", "yeah, or whatever, you know", "there have been a couple of routes where i\u2019ve been like \u2013 especially when i was younger and i was like soloing a route and i get up and all of a sudden i\u2019m like, \u201coh, i\u2019m on a bolted face, but this route isn\u2019t supposed to have bolts.\u201d and then i\u2019m like, \u201coh no, i\u2019m on the wrong route.\u201d then you like look over and you see that the real rout you\u2019re supposed to be on is like 100 meters to the right", "and then you\u2019re like, \u201ci wonder what route i\u2019m on.\u201d and then you\u2019re like, \u201coh, i hope it\u2019s not hard.\u201d and then you\u2019re suddenly like, \u201cshit!\u201d and then you start like pulling on the bolts, which is cheating", "and you\u2019re just like whatever it takes to like get off this wall, you know", "and so you\u2019re like pulling on bolts and stepping on bolts and like doing whatever it is to like get to the top", "and then later you\u2019re like, \u201coh, i wish i knew how to read the guide book.\u201d now, so this is a related question from drew cordova", "so there\u2019s a video that shows alex climbing el cap free solo where he said he was freaking out \u2013 \u00a0no, so that\u2019s \u2013 incorrect", "well, there are all kinds of incorrect [inaudible], but yeah", "i\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots", "yeah, just go on and i\u2019ll remark at the end", "where he\u2019s freaking out on the cliff face at one point", "i\u2019d like to know from his perspective what it takes to overcome that fear", "okay, so the video clip that he\u2019s referring to, i\u2019m actually free soloing the face at half dome, which is a different wall", "yeah", "and that\u2019s actually complicated because it shows me standing on this ledge on half dome like having a moment, being really scared", "but we shot that film like a year after my actual fee solo", "so i\u2019d gone out there and soloed it by myself, with nobody around, which is kind of the point of free soloing only", "and then we\u2019d gone back and filmed on it", "and when we filmed on it, i walked out on that ledge and like had a moment when i was a little bit afraid and then like sorted myself out, turned around and climbed back", "but then they used the voice over of me walking about the original experience when i\u2019d actually been free soloing it the year before, where i have like a much more significant moment on the section 100 feet higher, which is actually quite difficult climbing", "because like walking across a ledge is never that scary, you know what i mean", "like, in the grand scheme of rock climbing, like when you\u2019re standing on the ledge, like you\u2019re not scared", "it just happened in that case because i was standing face out, which is like a little off balance and a little scary and i was like, \u201cwhoa, this isn\u2019t what i expected.\u201d but it\u2019s not that big a thing", "but the actual experience up higher \u2013 it was like one of those things where they caught this moment on film and it kind of went well with the voice-over, sort of like \u2013 yeah", "[inaudible]", "the magic of [inaudible]", "yeah, exactly", "and so it made for a great film and it definitely like shares the free solo experience pretty well", "it\u2019s one of the things that at first i was like, i was sort of annoyed that it\u2019s not the literal, like this isn\u2019t what happened, but the thing is like nobody\u2019s there when it actually happens, so then it does share the experience pretty well", "so in the actual half dome experience, when it was scary, even though like you mentioned earlier you\u2019ve kind of rehearsed what it\u2019s going to feel like as you\u2019re going up this route, what do you \u2013 not to belabor this point, but it\u2019s something i\u2019m fascinated by \u2013 what\u2019s going through your head and how do you get through", "well, so that particular half dome free solo i actually hadn\u2019t rehearsed it that much really", "i had sort of intentionally chosen not to rehears the route very much, because i was like, \u201coh, that\u2019s going to take the adventure out of it", "i want to just go up there and do it.\u201d which in retrospect like wasn\u2019t the best idea", "but so, yeah, on half dome i didn\u2019t \u2013 i hadn\u2019t memorized the sequences", "i didn\u2019t really know like exactly what i should do", "i just knew that i could do it", "and i knew that\u2019s i\u2019d gone out there and i\u2019d done it, it was fine and that i was able to", "you know, in retrospect i probably should have spent a little bit more time", "and so why i got so scared was i got up to a certain sequence and i basically like didn\u2019t want to trust a specific foothold and i was like, \u201coh, this feels like my foot\u2019s going to slip and i don\u2019t want to fall.\u201d and then i tried to use some other feet but i was like, \u201coh, this doesn\u2019t \u2013 these are worse.\u201d and, you know, so you\u2019re standing there hesitating being like, \u201cwhat should i do", "what should i do?\u201d and then you start to get all gripped, like, \u201coh god, what if i can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d and like you\u2019re obviously getting more and more tired as you stand there, your calves are getting pumped", "and, you know, yeah, it\u2019s just strong toesing", "all right, we\u2019re back in action", "so during the little break, we were just talking about some past lives and i was mentioning that i wanted to be a [inaudible] was an illustrator for a period of time paying expenses in college, and had this other weird side gig of bouncing which was terrible because i was always the smallest guy as a bounder", "but what are the best and worst jobs that you had prior to climbing", "\u00a0 i haven\u2019t really had that many jobs", "i mean i worked at the climbing gym as a kid, just, you know, cleaning the bathrooms and doing summer camp stuff with kids", "and then i worked doing night security at berkeley for a semester that i was there", "i mean, i was only at berkeley for a year", "and so for my second semester there i was doing night security, i was basically just like walking around campus at night getting paid to like look at buildings", "when you were at berkeley, how did you decide to leave", "and what was that calculus like; i mean how long did it take you to decide \u2013 yeah, i didn\u2019t decide to just drop out of berkeley, it was more that i wasn\u2019t really happy there and then my first year at berkeley i happened to get second at the nationals, and so i got invited to the youth world cup, which was during what would have been my second fall semester", "and so i decided to take the semester off and then go do, you know, youth worlds and then travel a bit and climb and do whatever", "and also my father happened to die the summer after freshman year, and he was part of the pressure for like going to school", "not really pressure, but he just sort of like expected the kids to go to college type thing", "and then when he died it also left life insurance money for my sister and i to finish school", "and so, you know, that sort of allowed me to not go back to school", "and so just kind of a combination of events just led me to take the semester off and then i just like, you know, i\u2019m just taking the next 10 or like 20 semesters off since then", "were you close to your dad", "i was fairly close to my dad", "i mean \u2013 or we weren\u2019t super close in like talking about things and like having deep chats, but he definitely invested a ton of time in me", "you know, he took me to the climbing gym all the time", "he would drive me all over the state to competitions", "you know, he would take me camping, take me outside like, you know, we would be doing family camping trips in the mountains and stuff", "so i mean he definitely put a ton of energy into me", "do you \u2013 and i apologize, i don\u2019t know your status \u2013 do you want to get married, have kids", "yeah, i think i\u2019d like to have a family someday", "so that brings up something that i\u2019ve wanted to talk about and i hesitated to ask in part because i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been asked a million times, but as it relates to mortality, let\u2019s just say that somebody came to you \u2013 so this is kind of two in one \u2013 and they said i have $10 million and i\u2019m going to dedicate it to you but with the following condition", "you have to predict how you\u2019re going to die, accurately", "and in that case, it goes to the cause of your choosing", "so what would you predict and what cause would it go to", "that\u2019s interesting", "and if i predict wrong it just like doesn\u2019t go anywhere", "disappears", "poof", "okay", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, i think i would predict \u2013 i don\u2019t know, i\u2019m sort of 50-50 between natural causes, just like dying of old age at some point or like climbing accident in the grander scheme of like not necessarily like falling to my death which is what people think with the free soloing", "but just the random stuff like, you know, rappelling in the mountains or like being swept by an avalanche or like being hit by a random rock", "because there is a lot of just like random chance \u2013 or not a lot, but there is random chance involved with climbing", "\u00a0and just the fact that i am out climbing all the time, like it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if some random thing just happened to me like that", "though i mean that\u2019s kind of the, you know, the price to pay, you know", "like if you\u2019re going to be in those places like there is just a random risk associated with it", "so yeah, i mean, i think \u2013 and then the cause i would devote it to", "i don\u2019t know, some probably environmental \u2013 i mean basically the stuff that i\u2019m supporting through my foundation, which is you know any kind of environmental project that like improves standard of living", "which has mostly been like off-grid solar projects or like energy access and stuff", "\u00a0off-grid solar and energy access for whom or wherever", "for like rural communities", "i mean, i\u2019ve been supporting a group that does that kind of work in africa, which, you know, makes sense because folks have no access to energy", "and we\u2019ve also been supporting grid alternatives here in the states which does like home pv systems for like low income families", "basically it\u2019s just a way to like help, you know, folks that need some help", "and it helps the environment, obviously", "and just when we took a break we were talking about books and the fact that you read mostly non-fiction", "what non-fiction books have had an impact on you", "or that you particularly like", "i mean, in the last several years, i mean, some of the most noteworthy books i\u2019ve read i guess, like a people\u2019s history of the us, the howard zinn book totally changed the way i look at politics", "and then in the same way i read a book recently called sacred economics that like totally changed the way i looked at economics", "sacred economics", "yeah, it was actually totally interesting", "i forget who the author was now though", "i don\u2019t know", "i will", "we\u2019ll look it up and put it in the show notes", "sacred economics is like kind of awesome", "it like, yeah, changed my world a bit", "what\u2019s the kind of basic thesis of sacred economics, or is it \u2013 i don\u2019t know what the author would say about the thesis, but the things that i took away from it were \u2013 well, i mean, basically he\u2019s sort of envisioning different systems for like a more just kind of economics, you know", "because i mean our current style of capitalism basically just concentrates wealth in the hands of the already wealthy", "you know, and that\u2019s kind of like by definition the way interest rates work and stuff", "like if you have a lot you\u2019ll just continue to make a lot", "and that\u2019s not a fundamentally fair system, because if you don\u2019t have anything, you continue having nothing", "but if you already have more than you need, you just get more and more and more", "and that\u2019s just like not the way the world should work, i don\u2019t think.\u00a0 or at least i don\u2019t \u2013 i don\u2019t know", "so one of the ideas that he throws out in the book, which i found totally interesting, was like negative interest rates", "so like if you have a lot it basically just like slowly dwindles away unless you\u2019re actively using it for things like investing it into things", "so, you know, just by having a lot of money is not going to guarantee that you continue to have a lot of money", "unless you\u2019re allocating it in a certain way", "yeah, exactly", "unless you\u2019re using it wisely to like create value", "how do you assess risk", "whether that\u2019s with \u2013 and you can focus on one of these \u2013 whether that\u2019s on a particular climb, on like a business venture, a decision to do a versus b, how do you think about risk", "i don\u2019t know, that\u2019s an interesting question, because obviously i spend a ton of time thinking about risk", "but i just don\u2019t have like a clear cut, you know, like i don\u2019t have a clear metrics for like, you know, this is \u2013 and because with the climbing so much of it comes down to a feeling of like i feel a lot of fear when i think about that, obviously it\u2019s not for me", "yeah, i don\u2019t know exactly", "and i\u2019ve never really had to evaluate business ventures and things", "so let\u2019s touch on something you just said, which is, if you\u2019re very afraid of something, then that\u2019s something that you shouldn\u2019t do", "so do you then climb say hard routes in an absence of fear", "or is it present and then you overcome it", "that\u2019s a good question", "i generally climb hard routes in the absence of fear", "i generally don\u2019t go up on them unless i feel comfortable and i don\u2019t have that fear", "yes", "though, yeah, though i mean, it\u2019s important to sort of differentiate fear and risk and like all the terms i guess", "definitely", "because, you know, i mean if there is a high level of risk, i mean you should be feeling fear", "i mean fear is sort of that warning that, you know, like that there is real danger", "and so like if there is danger present, like i mean you should be feeling fear", "and so, you know, and there are times that maybe you should just suppress that fear and go for it anyway, maybe not, i don\u2019t know", "but so with the free soloing, typically if i\u2019m feeling a lot of fear, then i just, you know, wait and prepare more, or i don\u2019t know, something, do whatever it takes to mitigate that to like to feel comfortable and then do the climb when i feel comfortable", "tim ferriss:\u00a0\u00a0 do you have a \u2013 my suspicion says no \u2013 but do you have a checklist", "like i have to do this with gear x number of times and then do this y number of times before i\u2019m willing to free solo this", "or is it \u2013 i don\u2019t have a checklist, but i definitely have a degree of comfort that i need to feel on the route before i\u2019m willing to solo it", "what does that feel like", "well, it just feels like a certain \u2013 i guess i need to have a certain amount of reserve, i guess", "you know, i need to feel like i can climb the route in a variety of conditions and have some extra in the tank just in case, you know", "like if i can climb the route only by the narrowest of like razor thin margins, like then that\u2019s probably not good enough for free soloing", "and the definitions point is important", "so for instance, i\u2019m involved with a lot of speculative start-ups or start-ups, whether it\u2019s speculative or \u2013 they\u2019re all speculative", "yeah, i mean, but most of them would be considered very highly speculative", "and people say, \u201cwow, that\u2019s a really high risk investment", "you have a very high risk tolerance, right, doing things in entrepreneurship and so on.\u201d and i\u2019ve never felt that way, i actually like i\u2019m focused on risk mitigation at all times", "and so for me i thought about it at one point, because they were like, \u201coh, you have a really high risk tolerance", "risk, risk, risk.\u201d and i was like, \u201cwell, wait a second", "like we should try to figure out the definition of this term that we\u2019re using before we have a discussion about it.\u201d well, and isn\u2019t the thing with start-ups is that you\u2019re sort of willing to lose money on a certain number as long as like \u2013 exactly", "\u2013 some of them come out", "no, so exactly, like so i \u2013 so you\u2019re sort of just doing the math on the overall picture", "it\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t matter is some of them fail", "that\u2019s exactly right", "and what\u2019s important at least in that game, right, is \u2013 or that sport", "and you can look at it that way", "is following your own rules", "like if you set rules", "yeah", "and you understand, say portfolio theory and the math, if i follow these rules is going to turn out likely this way, therefore i need to make x number investments", "yeah, or at least have like a plan that you\u2019re willing to stick to", "and then not start to just get hog wild where you\u2019re like, \u201cwell, this guy said that you could make money on it.\u201d and not deviate", "yeah, exactly", "yeah", "so what i realized for myself that risk in my mind is the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome", "and if i look at it that way, if i do something that fails, if i can get back to where i was very easily, then that\u2019s not a risk", "it\u2019s not a high risk, for instance", "do you think you relate to risk or think about it differently than other people", "\u00a0 no, all that\u2019s pretty much in line with the way i look at risk", "i mean, yeah, i mean with the start-up stuff i wouldn\u2019t consider that particularly risky, because like obviously people make a lot of money off start-ups", "it\u2019s just a matter of like doing it well", "and like, you know, playing the stock market and things like that", "people obviously make a lot of money, so it\u2019s not like a fundamentally risky activity", "it\u2019s just a matter of like how you do it, how well you do it", "and obviously i\u2019m not in either of those worlds", "it also \u2013 i mean for me it probably would be dangerous, because, you know i\u2019d be like, \u201cwell, now i have no money.\u201d but it\u2019s because that\u2019s not my thing", "like i don\u2019t know anything about it", "what is the best decision you\u2019ve ever made not to do something", "or a good decision that you\u2019ve made not to do something", "well, i think pretty much any of the free solos that i backed off of and climbed down were probably all pretty good decisions", "i mean, who\u2019s to say", "i mean, maybe they all would have been fine and i would have just like climbed to the top and had a nice day", "but, you know, [inaudible] on that stuff", "yeah \u2013 if you\u2019re not psyched, you\u2019re not psyched", "but i haven\u2019t had any like clear \u2013 or like near misses where i decided not to climb something and then there\u2019s like a huge avalanche that sweeps the whole mountain and you\u2019re like, \u201cthank god i wasn\u2019t up there.\u201d you have a very minimalist lifestyle", "what is something that you spent too much on, but don\u2019t regret", "or something that you spend too much on but don\u2019t regret", "or a lot on", "too much is too judgmental", "i don\u2019t know, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much, but when i bought noise cancelling headphones i was like, this seems really indulgent, but it made my life so much better", "like, i love traveling with noise cancelling headphones", "it\u2019s like my favorite possession", "how do you use them", "oh just, i mean, i cancel noise with them", "[inaudible]", "do you use them all the time when you\u2019re travelling, or are they like \u2013", "like in the airport and on the plane i pretty much have noise cancelling headphones on the whole time", "i love it", "i\u2019ll just like listen to soft music and like read my book or work on my computer, do whatever", "you know, just hang out", "but i just like love not having all the crazy bustle-y noise around me the whole time", "what type of music do you listen to most often when you\u2019re flying", "flying i do a lot of sound tracks", "like sort of like classically type music, but you know, set to indiana jones let\u2019s say or whatever", "braveheart", "yeah, exactly", "oh yeah, actually i\u2019ve never done the braveheart sound track", "but like the last mohicans is a favorite", "that\u2019s a great sound track", "great soundtrack", "yeah", "do you ever climb to music", "i\u2019ll do easy climbing to music, for sure", "i normally just have my phone in my pocket and will just blast it like, you know, stereo style", "but that\u2019s only if i\u2019m climbing something where there\u2019s nobody around", "because i think it\u2019s super annoying when you like hike up to people on a trail with like a boom box going", "because obviously it\u2019s like diminishing their outdoor experience", "in those cases, what type of music do you listen to", "i pretty much only listen to like modern rock", "like [inaudible] rock and stuff", "like what", "like what \u2013 yeah, what kind of bands", "oh, i don\u2019t know, like i was listening to like bad religion", "we listened to metallica last time on the drive and like, you know, [inaudible] or like tool or random, whatever", "what is something that people \u2013 and this is in quotes \u2013 \u201cknow\u201d about you that is wrong", "i don\u2019t know, i mean i think a lot of people \u2013 i mean certainly online commentary a lot of people think i have a death wish or like have never experienced fear", "like, just don\u2019t care about my safety", "i mean, the thing is that if you just watch the youtube videos, you get the impression that i just like walk up to a wall and climb it", "and like, you sort of miss the 20 years of climbing culture that\u2019s behind it", "you know, the fact that i\u2019ve \u2013 that there\u2019s a huge history behind all these routes and i know a lot about them, and i have tons of friends that have climbed them", "and i can like recite half the moves on them from memory", "you know what i mean", "like there\u2019s a ton that goes into it that people like don\u2019t see in the three minute youtube short", "and, you know, yeah", "well, it\u2019s kind of like i had laird hamilton on the podcast, right, the sort of undisputed king of big wave surfing", "people would \u2013 it\u2019s funny how people look at that and they have a different judgment than when they look at you on a wall", "even though in practical terms \u2013 you think", "i mean, don\u2019t people look at his big wave surfing and be like, \u201cthat guy\u2019s crazy, he has a death wish?\u201d because i kind of do", "i\u2019m like, that\u2019s [inaudible]", "so, i think that it\u2019s slightly the frequency with which i hear people say that is different because they look at a wall and they\u2019re like, \u201coh, i could climb up things.\u201d but they look at a 100-foot wave and somebody getting towed in on a jet ski and they\u2019re like, \u201ci wouldn\u2019t even be able to stand up on the board while getting pulled on a jet ski", "hm", "therefore, assumption, assumption, assumption", "what do you think of, say, free divers who try to break records in free diving", "i mean, i don\u2019t know much about it, but it does seem like it\u2019s one of the riskiest sports in the world", "i mean, more people die doing that than virtually anything else", "yeah", "i mean, it kind of goes with wingsuiting or something where like, you know, it\u2019s fair to say that it actually is quite risky because people do actually die all the time doing it", "have you ever done any wing suit stuff", "no, i did my ff so i like learned how to parachute out of a plane, on the thought that i would maybe eventually learn how to base jump or something", "and then i was basically just like, \u201ci\u2019m not into this", "i don\u2019t think this is cool", "i don\u2019t like it.\u201d just the \u2013 just because the risk, the down side risk \u2013 no, i mean \u2013 \u2013 down side is too high", "no, skydiving is not dangerous, you know, so i mean when you\u2019re leaning out of the plane it\u2019s like not sketchy at all, but mostly i was like i just don\u2019t like this, you know", "and like i don\u2019t want to devote the energy to like learning how to do this", "and i sort of realized how much it would take for me to feel comfortable doing that", "and i was like, this is just dumb, i\u2019m not into it", "yeah", "and then as it turns out, you know, like one of my good friends and climbing partners died wingsuiting, and then last year notably dean potter died wingsuiting", "and so, i mean, you know, climbing has lost a lot of high end climbers to wingsuiting accidents", "it\u2019s like, you know, i mean it is a very dangerous activity", "you mentioned dean potter", "i think when i hear his name i also associate it with \u2013 you think slacklining", "exactly, slacklining", "you seem to have like the perfect slacklining feet", "i mean maybe we can take a photograph \u2013 they\u2019re all messed up", "yeah, you\u2019ve got some amazing like \u2013 functional feet", "do you slackline much", "functional", "that\u2019s a very kind way of putting deformed", "yeah, highly functional, yes", "do you slackline or what\u2019s your [inaudible]", "no, i can slackline at like a low level", "you know, i can like walk lines back and forth", "just because there\u2019s so many slacklines in camp grounds and climbing areas and things, you know, i definitely have done a fair amount of slacklining", "and i can do some like really easy tricks and things, but no, i\u2019m definitely not a slackliner and i\u2019ve never done any high lines and i\u2019m not like \u2013 i\u2019m not into slacklining", "when you think of the word successful, who\u2019s the first person who comes to mind for you", "when i hear successful", "yeah, just the word successful", "i mean, when you just said i thought elon musk", "but then i\u2019m like, i have no idea, you know, because i don\u2019t know that much about business", "but i\u2019m just like, that\u2019s rad", "is there anyone that you would want to model your life after in any way", "probably not", "though i do like reading, you know, a biography or something and then sort of \u2013 like i have some notes on my phone of like lists from random things i\u2019ve read, you know, where you sort of choose little lessons out of like a book about somebody and you\u2019re like, \u201coh, like that person did these things well and those are all things that i can apply to my life.\u201d but, you know, i wouldn\u2019t want to model my whole life on somebody", "it\u2019s more like, you know, cherry picking the good lesson here and there", "which biographies have produced a lot of notes for you", "or just \u2013 i\u2019ve only done this a few times, but so i read the biography of brad washburn, who is like a big \u2013 if you know him, he was like an \u2013 i do know him", "\u2013 [inaudible] photographer", "he also ran the like a natural history museum in boston, i think", "but so he just had like a wide and varied career and he was like a national geographic explorer type", "you know, he just did a lot with his life", "and so after i finished reading the book i was like, \u201cwhoa, this guy like got shit done.\u201d you know", "and, i don\u2019t know, you know, i respect that and so i just like kind of thought about it", "what is something that you believe that other people think is crazy", "that i believe that other people think i crazy", "well, i don\u2019t know, i mean i think that my evaluation of risk and all the things we were just talking about, a lot of people think it\u2019s totally crazy", "mm-hmm", "but that\u2019s speaking \u2013 i mean, i think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have a full set of facts on it", "you know, they don\u2019t quite appreciate it in the same way that i do", "mm-hmm", "but i don\u2019t know if i have any other like totally outlandish beliefs like that", "mm-hmm", "do you \u2013 i\u2019m sure you have this question before \u2013 but would you consider yourself a religious person", "do you have a particular belief system", "no, i\u2019m like strongly atheist and just like not into religion at all", "mm-hmm", "were your parents religious at all or no", "yeah, mom is \u2013 at least used to identify as catholic", "she probably would still say that she believes in god, though there\u2019s no evidence of it at all", "like she doesn\u2019t go to church anymore or do anything", "but, yeah, so as kids we were taken to church", "but at no point did i ever believe anything", "mm-hmm", "okay, so there was no sort of transitionary period", "it was just [crosstalk]", "no, i know that \u2013 it\u2019s funny, like even though we were being taken to church, i just always thought it was all a bunch of weird stories", "it just like made no sense to me", "i\u2019m like, \u201cwhy would you believe in some invisible thing?\u201d i\u2019m like, \u201cwhy would you ever believe any of that?\u201d like it doesn\u2019t make any sense", "it\u2019s weird", "it\u2019s weird that so many adults believe all that stuff, because it still doesn\u2019t make any sense", "there\u2019s a lot of stuff that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense that people believe too", "yeah", "[inaudible] in the theater of politics and elsewhere too", "well, you know", "but this is going to be a gear shift", "i mean, we\u2019re shifting a lot of gears", "i\u2019m grinding out the transmission on gears", "but food", "i want to talk about do you have any particular thoughts on food", "or how do you think about eating, yourself", "not literally eating yourself, but \u2013 yeah, yeah", "i mean i\u2019m not much of a cook and i don\u2019t like love food or food prep or anything", "you know, if i could i would just like take a pill and be like fully fed all day every day", "and just like, sweet, i don\u2019t have to worry about it", "but i don\u2019t know, in the last couple of years i\u2019ve gone vegetarian, which has more to do with like the environmental non-fiction i\u2019ve been reading", "it\u2019s more just it\u2019s like one of the few things that i can do as an individual to like really have an impact on the world", "but, yeah, i don\u2019t know, i mean", "do you have any go-to dinners", "like what are your most common dinners, what do they look like", "i mean, for all the years that i\u2019ve lived in the van, one of my go-to dinners was like mac n cheese with stuff in it", "you know, like adding a vegetable", "i used to add tuna to it a lot", "then i switched to just like vegetable or, you know, maybe some beans or whatever", "yeah, like mac n cheese and chili", "but now i\u2019ve sort of easing away from mac n cheese too because i\u2019ve kind of stopped eating dairy", "but so like, you know, rice and vegetable stuff or like lentils or whatever", "keeping it simple", "yeah", "so many questions", "so many questions i want to ask", "do you have any morning rituals", "like what are the first 60 days \u2013 60 days \u2013 the first 60 minutes of your day look like", "i pretty much always just get up and have like a big breakfast and then go climbing", "that\u2019s kind of the standard", "and when is your usual wake-up", "for the last two months i\u2019ve been waking up doing some 15 minute of stretching, then eating my breakfast, then going climbing, just because of the back stuff", "mm-hmm", "but \u2013 what time do you generally wake up and go to bed", "i generally \u2013 i\u2019m pretty unstructured, so i basically just go to sleep whenever i need to or whenever it makes sense, then i just wale up whenever", "i try to sleep as much as i want to", "what does that typically amount \u2013 i mean, people think they\u2019re like, \u201coh that four-hour work week guy, that guy must sleep three hours a night.\u201d i try to sleep eight to ten", "yeah, no, i\u2019m all about the eight to ten, for sure", "i think last night \u2013 i mean i was sleeping in front of your house last night", "i think i slept nine last night", "well, because \u2013 okay, wait a second", "is that the van", "yeah, yeah, that\u2019s my car", "i just saw it when walking my dog and i was like, who\u2019s camped out in front of my house", "yeah, yeah, no", "that is fucking hilarious", "okay", "yeah, with like the reflectors on the windows", "yeah, yeah, the reflectors", "i was like, who is this trying to kidnap me", "who is this \u2013", "no, no, that\u2019s my rape wagon parked in front of your house", "it\u2019s one of the things like, we drove to san francisco last night and then i\u2019m like, well, i don\u2019t want to park somewhere else and then have to drive here in the morning", "so i\u2019m like, i\u2019m just going to go and park there", "i\u2019m going to sleep in as late as possible and i\u2019m gonna wake up and i\u2019m gonna come in and do a podcast", "it\u2019s gonna be like totally [inaudible]", "you\u2019re right", "from \u2013 but that\u2019s the thing about living in a car is you\u2019re all about like minimizing the waste of time, you know", "there\u2019s no point in like driving around in circles", "you just park where you need to be", "sleep, and then do your thing", "that\u2019s amazing", "all right, so \u2013 and the thing is, after \u2013 and i\u2019ve lived in the van for like 10 years now", "you know, it starts to become a routine", "it\u2019s like hard to imagine like going to a hotel, moving all your shit into a room, moving it back into your car later, moving the car", "you\u2019re just like, what a waste of time", "i just want to like park where i need to be", "so a lot of people have asked this, and i\u2019m kind of curious myself", "like the logistics of alex honnold", "so, if you have a date, and the date goes well, like what then", "they come back to the van", "i mean, it\u2019s a nice van", "it\u2019s like a \u2013 you call it a little mini home or whatever", "you know, one of the micro home stuff or what\u2019s it called, little \u2013 yeah, tiny houses", "yeah, tiny house", "i\u2019ve got a bunch of tiny home books [inaudible]", "there you go, see, i have one out front", "yeah", "a tiny little home", "listen now, before you go out on the date, you\u2019re like just in case this goes well do you put out like some rose petals in a bowl or water", "no, preferably go back to their place", "it\u2019s like a little classier", "do you have any favorite documentaries and movies", "i don\u2019t know", "not particularly, i guess", "i mean, my movie tastes run sort of just straight like hollywood action movie like total fluff, you know, like gladiator or something", "mm-hmm", "just like fun times", "like, yeah", "roger", "all right", "we\u2019ll keep that at that", "it\u2019s all pretty \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s pretty like unimpressive", "but it\u2019s kind of because movies \u2013 because i do a lot of like reading non-fiction and stuff, i feel like movies fill the fluff category", "you know, like i hate heavy non-fiction \u2013 or like heavy documentary type films", "i just like fall asleep to those", "just too much thinking after all the non-fiction [inaudible]", "yeah, i don\u2019t know", "what movies have you seen the greatest number of times", "is there anything you\u2019ve watched like over and over again", "i have that habit", "i\u2019ve probably seen the star wars movies a lot of times, but that\u2019s partially just because i started when i was a kid and then i\u2019ve like rewatched them over the years", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019ve seen anything else like more that probably", "i think i have maybe weird numbers, because for each of my books i get \u2013 i feel very isolated if i\u2019m writing at night in a dark house by myself", "so i always put this \u2013 you put on certain movies", "i have movies \u2013 for each book there are usually one or two movies that i\u2019ll just put on repeat and i\u2019ll put them on mute and then listen to music", "like, the same tracks over and over and over and over again", "your brain might be like hardwired in some weird way too", "well, i gotta \u2013 that\u2019s definitely true", "but i gotta \u2013 that\u2019s getting tweaky", "i like the same music, the same movie", "well, i had a recommendation from this very, very, very brilliant capable entrepreneur in matt mullenweg who is a great coder, and he always \u2013 he listens to the same single track over and over again almost like a noise machine when he\u2019s coding", "hm", "and i thought, okay, well, i\u2019ll try that with writing and it worked really, really well", "but the movies ended up being really weird, because \u2013 okay, so what movies are we talking about", "so, well, for the four hour work week it was the \u2013 this isn\u2019t that weird, i think these are fine movies", "but the bourne identity was the first", "and then for the four hour body it was casino royale, which i think is a fantastic \u2013 i was hoping you were going to say like rocky or something, so being non-stop training montages", "well, there are a lot of fight scenes, and the parkour events in the beginning with s\u00e9bastien foucan, who\u2019s incredible", "yeah, yeah, yeah", "so that\u2019s \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s a whole separate \u2013 i didn\u2019t know that was [inaudible]", "oh yeah, so good", "that\u2019s cool", "and then for the four hour chef, this is super \u2013 this is off theme completely, but i was just looking for a movie when i was just getting started and on amazon prime the first movie that popped up was babe, with like the little pig", "with the pig", "yeah, farmer hoggit", "and i watched babe like a thousand times because i just put it on repeat and watched it like four or five times a night", "whoa", "go figure", "yeah, we could psychoanalyze that", "hard core", "hard core", "aside from the noise cancelling headphones, what purchase has most positively impacted your life in the last say six months", "i mean, definitely my van", "definitely your van", "yeah, i mean, no question", "i mean the last van that i bought, a $10,000 van and lived in it for 10 years", "and then this new van that i bought, it\u2019s a new van so it\u2019s obviously a bit pricier, but it\u2019s like pretty awesome and i\u2019ll probably live in it for another ten years", "well, maybe not actually live in it, but, you know, i\u2019ll be based out of it", "again, returning to the \u2013 this is not directly related to the dating and the van, but this is a question from michael sipriano", "i\u2019ve always found climbing to have a large positive effect on my libido", "does alex find this to be the case", "well, i\u2019ve climbed for my entire life, so i mean maybe it explains \u2013 just a permanent \u2013 \u2013 the tremendous libido", "do you \u2013 i mean, is that for real", "that\u2019s a real question", "okay", "i guess, i don\u2019t know", "but, i mean, that\u2019s probably true of anybody who\u2019s like staying active and staying fit", "you know, you\u2019re just like; it\u2019s the way your body\u2019s supposed to work", "yeah", "are there ways that you\u2019ve seen lessons learned or skills developed in climbing translate to other parts of your life", "and if so, is there any particular examples that come to mind", "i don\u2019t know exac- i mean, so i\u2019ve gained a lot from being a professional climber", "like having to go and give talks and like do the whole works [inaudible] climbing", "i mean that\u2019s really like helped me grow as a person and feel comfortable doing public speaking and all that kind of stuff", "though i think from the actual climbing itself, maybe the most useful thing i\u2019ve gotten has been sort of being able to differentiate, you know, risk and consequence and fear and like all these different things, and sort of being able to separate my feelings from what\u2019s actually happening", "you know, like, oh i feel fear, but is that fear justified because i\u2019m actually in danger, or is that like totally irrational fear that i should just squish and like move forward with something", "and i don\u2019t know, i mean, i feel like climbing has sort of helped me understand like the different things that are going on there", "you know, whereas i feel like a lot of people are just like, oh i\u2019m afraid, and then they\u2019re just like, \u201coh god, i\u2019m afraid.\u201d you know, but sometimes like i mean fear shouldn\u2019t necessarily control you any more than anything else", "desire or fill in the blank", "well, yeah, like when you\u2019re really hungry you\u2019re not like, \u201coh god, i\u2019m hungry, i\u2019m hungry, i\u2019m hungry!\u201d you\u2019re just like, \u201coh, i\u2019ll eat lunch in two hours.\u201d you know, and i feel like fear to some extent should be the same way, where you can just register like, \u201coh, i\u2019m feeling fear right now.\u201d but sometimes that doesn\u2019t matter", "i mean sometimes it does, and you need to be like, \u201coh, you know, i\u2019m about to die", "like, i should watch out for that.\u201d but a lot of the times, i mean, you should be able to just set that fear aside and just do exactly what you\u2019re supposed to be doing", "yeah, so i mean, in a way, i mean, you\u2019re a connoisseur of fear, right", "you can distinguish sort of all the different \u2013 [inaudible]", "the varietals of fear", "yeah, yeah, totally", "[inaudible]", "and yeah, when you experience enough fear in your life you\u2019re like, \u201coh now i can sort of differentiate between all the different types.\u201d do you drink coffee or caffeine", "no", "i don\u2019t have \u2013 i just don\u2019t like coffee and i don\u2019t really like tea", "but i don\u2019t have any problem with caffeine", "i don\u2019t even really notice caffeine i don\u2019t think that much", "because you get it in like shot blocks and gels and goo\u2019s and whatever, all the little energy products", "right", "like some of them have caffeine and some don\u2019t", "i don\u2019t feel like i notice an effect either way", "well, the reason i asked is that i find personally i remember i did a three-day meditation retreat", "my first meditation retreat", "and they disallowed caffeine", "they said no caffeine and no alarm clocks", "you wake up when you wake up", "welcome to my life", "that\u2019s \u2013 it sounds amazing", "i\u2019m on a 20-year meditation streak", "yeah, i need to do more of that", "and i came back from that experience and went back into my normal routine, which was drinking not coffee at that point, but a lot of iced tea", "like i\u2019d go to a restaurant, they would just endlessly refill my iced tea, and i felt like a complete crackhead", "like a miserable crackhead", "yeah", "and i was like, is this what my normal was", "holy shit", "and the reason that i brought it up is that it strikes me that at least in that state i would have a lot of trouble distinguishing the fine nuances of different types of fear", "mm-hmm", "mm-hmm", "because you\u2019re just overwhelmed", "when you\u2019re all jacked up on sugar from iced tea stuff and then you\u2019re \u2013 yeah, and the caffeine and you know, yeah, totally", "there\u2019s like a lot going on physiologically and it\u2019s hard to differentiate like what the finer points are", "yeah, the signal from the noise", "mm-hmm", "at what climbing grades have you plateaued the most", "this is from liz wolfe", "and she just said 5.11 plateau has been really bad for me", "which probably means she\u2019s hasn\u2019t got past the 5.11 plateau", "yeah", "she\u2019s just like mired in 5.11 land", "no, so i\u2019ve basically \u2013 i pretty much progressed steadily to about mid-5.14", "so like 14 a or c and i\u2019ve basically been plateaued there for like seven or ten years or something", "though i feel like i\u2019ve sort of plateaued there because i\u2019m at the point \u2013 i mean, because mid 5.14 is definitely a fairly high level of climbing", "though it\u2019s by no means a lead by the world standard anymore", "like that\u2019s not like super hard", "just to put it in perspective, what would be a \u2013 the hardest thing in the world is 15 c", "but only two people have climbed that", "but there are a lot of people climbing like 15 a and 15 b-ish now", "and so climbing like 14 b or c is like, you know, respectable", "but a lot of people can do that like first try no pro- not a lot, but a handful of people can climb that first try no problem", "it\u2019s like trivial for them", "so, you know what i mean, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s by no means world standard", "but, you know, it\u2019s solid", "but so i think that for me that\u2019s sort of my natural plateau", "like that\u2019s kind of what i can climb without having to train much to climb harder", "you know, because the thing is i spend a lot of my year doing like adventure trips and expeditions and, you know, doing stuff through my foundation, going to angola last year", "i mean, trips like that that do not help your fitness at all", "like they won\u2019t help you climb harder", "but they definitely make you a more well-rounded climber and probably a better person and more interesting, you get to do fun stuff", "mm-hmm", "and so, you know, i\u2019ve sort of been content being plateaued at mid 5.14 for a long time", "though i could see at some point in my life i might devote a year or two to like actually trying to climb harder", "because i\u2019d love to climb the french grade 9 a, which is 14 d in us grades", "it\u2019s just sort of like a meaningful benchmark grade", "that if i ever climb 9 a i\u2019d be like respect, like i\u2019m good", "like that\u2019s hard enough for me", "so if you wanted to do that hard climbing, what would the most important components of that training look like", "i\u2019m not totally sure", "i mean i think for me it would require more finger boarding or hang boarding", "like basically just focusing more on finger strength, because i think as a climber that\u2019s probably what i\u2019m worst at, is just like the pure strength holding on to things", "but also i think for me it would just require more dedicated focused hard climbing for the year", "you know, like right now i\u2019m climbing yosemite, and in my whole season of climbing yosemite i won\u2019t do a single hard move basically at the physical limit of like what i can actually pull on, because i\u2019m climbing these great big walls and i\u2019m trying to climb them quickly and sometimes i\u2019m climbing them ropeless", "but anyway, i\u2019m doing them in all these styles that like it just doesn\u2019t help you pull harder", "and so like if i wanted to climb harder grades i would have to just pull harder", "if you could no longer climb but had to pick a physical activity, what would you pick", "if i couldn\u2019t climb", "i don\u2019t know, i have a lot of respect for ultra-runners", "i think because they sort of interact with the landscape in the same way that i kind of like to", "you know, something like the ultra-tour of mont blanc when you like run all the way around the mont blanc massif, i mean that\u2019s pretty cool", "and like, i would love to be able to do things like that", "but i just like don\u2019t really \u2013 i can\u2019t un that well", "but the thing is, is that i really love running like mountain ridge lines and things, and then that quickly becomes actual rock climbing", "and so i\u2019m like, well, it\u2019s like, i don\u2019t know", "but yeah, ultra-running is pretty awesome", "i don\u2019t know", "i could be into like big mountain skiing too", "but see it all sort of gravitates back towards mountains", "and i\u2019m like, well, that\u2019s basically climbing", "and then you get exposed to nasty things like avalanches", "for those of you who haven\u2019t seen marrow \u2013 jesus, jimmy", "both of you guys make me sweat", "not that i need any help, i tend to run hot, drinking tea anyway", "but i digress", "as usual", "what do you world class at aside from climbing", "or within climbing that people might not realize", "or how would your best friends answer that question", "i don\u2019t know, i mean, i guess within climbing i\u2019d say that \u2013 because i\u2019m known as a free soloist, i\u2019m known for the ropeless climbing and that\u2019s like what you\u2019ll see online and all the videos and all that", "but i\u2019d probably still be a professional climber even if i didn\u2019t free solo at all", "like right now i hold the speed record on like pretty much every major formation in yosemite", "with, you know, all the different faces, like all the classic routes", "like i think that\u2019s basically true", "and so yeah, i don\u2019t know, i mean, i\u2019d probably still be like one of the more well-rounded climbers in america, even without the free soloing", "but it\u2019s all sort of overshadowed by the like, \u201coh my god, he\u2019s ropeless.\u201d and it\u2019s funny, because i only do, you know a handful of solos a year, if that", "and then i spend the whole rest of the year climbing with partners and ropes and like normal climbing with my friends", "just like doing all kinds of interesting things and expeditions and whatever", "and yet is till just comes down to like, \u201cwhoa, free soloing,\u201d but, you know, i\u2019m fine with that, because at least i get to go climb all the time", "what advice would you give to your 25-year-old self", "twenty-five or twenty, depending on who needed it the most", "and if you could just place like what you were doing, where you were at the time", "well, 20 is still slightly too old, but like my 18-year-old self, i would just tell to \u2013 i would say to just not bother going to college at all", "because like the year that i spent at berkeley was a total waste of my time, basically", "not because there\u2019s anything wrong with berkeley, but because i just wasn\u2019t passionate about what i was studying, and there\u2019s no \u2013 there was no point in me like grinding out a year of studies that i didn\u2019t care about", "you know, i should have just like gone climbing", "because, i mean, that\u2019s what i really cared about", "and that\u2019s what\u2019s been so funny over the years, is that like with climbing, you know, i have no problem putting in, you know, 20 to 40 hours a week, every week, all year into climbing", "like, and i mean, that\u2019s a fair amount \u2013 i\u2019ve been keeping a training journal", "so i have like sort of hours of exercise", "and last year i counted up at the new year and i basically averaged like 27 hours a week of exercise every week last year", "which is, you know, like i think that\u2019s kind of comparable to other \u2013 i mean, you would know more than me, but other sports like for training volume", "mm-hmm", "but i mean, then when you think that i\u2019ve probably been doing that for the last 10 years that i\u2019ve been on the road", "and actually, last year was a particularly low volume year for me because i had a book come out, so i did a month of book touring and i was in like a month of touring in south america", "and so like, i was climbing much less than i normally would", "so presumably a few years ago living in the van i was probably doing like 30, probably 30 or 32 hours a week of exercise", "which is like a lot of time spent climbing", "that is a lot of time", "what else do you put in your training journal", "what other details are in there", "it\u2019s one line", "i do one line, hours of exercise, one line any additional like strength training type stuff or like the stretching i\u2019ve been doing recently", "and then one line diet, which is like are well, ate poorly, at so-so, or like, you know, too many cookies like whatever things like that", "do you go back \u2013 do you eat a lot of cookies", "sometimes", "i have an unfortunate problem", "what\u2019s your go-to cookie", "just like chocolate chip cookies, like straight", "i can eat a lot of cookies", "yeah, well, that\u2019s probably the only thing that athletically \u2013 well, that we share in common", "oh yeah", "do you go big on the cookies", "yeah", "there are these \u2013 i see you looking towards your kitchen", "well, i was looking, i have this like secret stash", "i have to keep it out of sight", "there are these chocolate chip cookies that are actually from long island tates, i think they are", "somebody\u2019s nodding over there", "what are these, like special imported chocolate chip cookies", "well, originally from long island, and they have \u2013 they\u2019re chocolate chip cookies and there are these \u2013 i think they\u2019re gluten free ginger cookies", "and i can\u2019t have those in my house or i will demolish the entire thing", "see that\u2019s my thing with desserts too, is that i don\u2019t really buy dessert much, because if i buy it i\u2019ll just eat it all immediately", "like i\u2019m terrible with moderation", "so i generally don\u2019t have any dessert in the van", "and then when i do i just eat it all", "if you were to \u2013 i know this is a bit of a reach, but \u2013 you\u2019re 30 now, let\u2019s say your idealized 40-year-old self, right, what advice do you think that 40-year-old would give you now", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, i feel like i\u2019m doing pretty well right now", "oh, i\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not", "just \u2013 oh", "yeah, no, i don\u2019t know.\u00a0 i mean, just, you know, just enjoy the ride", "just enjoy the process", "what would you like your life to look like in 10 years", "i don\u2019t know", "i mean, maybe have a family or something, or at least a solid partner, solid something going on", "i think i\u2019d like to maybe own a home or like have a place that i\u2019m kind of living", "like more of a solid home base", "just because like living in a van is great, but, you know, at a certain point you\u2019re like, man, it\u2019s nice to have like a bathroom", "having like a shower and things", "so how do you deal with that, actually, now that [inaudible] [01:41:49]", "well, that\u2019s why when i came into your house i used your bathroom", "oh", "okay", "that\u2019s it", "so like last night, you\u2019re like, oh man, i had too much water", "well, i have \u2013 no, i have a pee bottle on me", "like, i\u2019ve used a bottle forever", "and actually the thing is, when you get used to using a pee bottle all the time, like when i pull into a grocery store or something, i always just like pee in my bottle before i go in, because you\u2019re like, why would i ever go and find some like dank public bathroom when like i can just use my bottle", "so do you have \u2013 is it a disposable pee bottle", "like \u2013 no, no, it\u2019s like i use a \u2013 like a [inaudible]", "no, i use like a 2-liter bottle, just like some random plastic bottle", "and i basically use it over and over until it\u2019s like this is repulsive, and then i recycle it", "and then i move on to another", "but it\u2019s actually kind of this natural \u2013 it\u2019s like a natural lifecycle", "because i\u2019ll use the same water bottle for climbing, it will just be like some random 2-liter bottle that\u2019s in my bag for like months", "but then eventually it starts to get disgusting or just kind of, you know, a little gross and so then well like that becomes the pee bottle and then i get another bottle", "it\u2019s like the 4-month cycle on my bottles, you know", "do you label them or do you just know by \u2013 no, but \u2013 \u2014 smell", "yeah, with the pee bottle you just know", "like, you know, when you open the bottle you\u2019re like, \u201coh, i shouldn\u2019t drink this.\u201d but also i have systems with like where things go", "and, you know, i\u2019m never going to accidently like drink my pee bottle", "do people visit you in your van, like hang out in your van, aside from the dates", "yeah, no, i mean friends hang out in my van for sure", "i mean, a lot of my climbing friends would be staying in a tent normally or staying wherever", "so i mean for them it\u2019s a big step up to hang out in the van", "it\u2019s like climate controlled, you know, you can \u2013 it\u2019s like sheltered", "you can cook on a nice stove, it\u2019s lit", "i mean it\u2019s a nice place to hang out in the evenings", "if you could have one billboard with anything on it, what would it say", "or what would you put on it", "a message to the world", "oh, i don\u2019t know", "i mean, like, just like, i don\u2019t know, environmental propaganda or something", "or like the meat stuff", "i\u2019m like pretty stoked on all the vegetarian type of stuff now, just because it\u2019s such an easy way to minimize your impact on the planet", "and it\u2019s just, you know, i mean, it just solves so many different environmental issues", "but i don\u2019t know", "but the thing is, a bill board is not the best way to say don\u2019t eat meat, because it\u2019s like it\u2019s obviously a lot more complicated than that and nobody\u2019s going to read that and be like, \u201coh, okay, i\u2019ll stop.\u201d right", "you know", "it\u2019s like, requires \u2013 requires more of a conversation", "yeah, i mean, it requires like a whole \u2013 and even then it\u2019s like it\u2019s not to say that like meat is fundamentally bad", "it\u2019s like how you get it, where it\u2019s from, what you\u2019re supporting", "i mean, you know, it\u2019s like a whole \u2013 feed lot versus this versus that", "yeah, yeah", "i mean, even that\u2019s like really complicated", "yeah", "because there are places in the world where it makes sense to raise animals, because like you can\u2019t raise anything else", "you can\u2019t grow crops, you, you know, whatever and so", "what have you changed your mind about in the last few years, if anything", "i mean, the first thing that comes to mind is like in high school i was reading a bunch of ayn rand, like objectivist, all super black and white, basically like f the poor, people should work harder, they should try harder", "and now as a 30-year-old i\u2019m basically like all about trying to help the poor or trying to help the planet in different ways", "trying to make the world a better place", "it\u2019s like a full 180 from the black and white that i was into in high school", "and then, yeah, i mean, i\u2019ve had massive changes on all those kinds of things", "i mean, i used to be way more harsh", "and like my political views are like way further left now", "i\u2019m just way more \u2013 i mean i\u2019m a lot more compassionate now i feel like", "though it\u2019s funny, not so much on a personal level, because i don\u2019t really care", "but on like a societal level i\u2019m a lot more compassionate", "that\u2019s amazing", "all right, i can\u2019t let that one go right away", "so \u2013 well, because i was like, i can\u2019t self-describe as compassionate, because none of my friends would agree, you know", "because the thing is that i\u2019m not like nice to like my friends", "on like a one-on-one level i\u2019m not like a super kind person, i don\u2019t think", "but definitely in the grander sense, i mean, i\u2019m trying to make \u2013 i aspire to make the world a better place and like a more just world", "kind of on the macro level", "yeah, exactly", "so if i took, say, a couple of your closest friends and gave them a bottle or two of wine, we\u2019re just handing out, how would they describe you", "i don\u2019t know, i mean, i \u2013 i mean if you had to guess", "i mean \u2013 i shudder to think", "well, i mean, the thing i\u2019m pretty frank i think, and so people can \u2013 i can kind of be a dick sometimes", "though i just consider that being very honest, you know", "keeping it real", "yeah, i\u2019m just keeping it real", "keeping it real", "no, i mean, i\u2019d like to think that my friends would still call me a good person, you know, that i\u2019m still like still trying to \u2013 i\u2019m doing my best, you know", "do you have any \u2013 we\u2019re going to wrap up here \u2013 any ask or request for my audience", "that could be something you want them to think about, something you would like them to try, something you would like them to do", "i feel like they\u2019re all mma fighters and i\u2019d ask them not to beat me up over [inaudible]", "they\u2019re not all mma fighters", "i assure you", "\u00a0i don\u2019t know, do something positive in the world, you know", "not a bad place to wrap up", "where can people find more of you online, best place to say hello, see what you\u2019re up to", "i mean my most personal outlet is probably my facebook fan page", "i\u2019m like constantly posting stuff that i care about", "and it\u2019s all managed by me", "and so it\u2019s just like me posting articles that i think are interesting", "it\u2019s kind of like a combination of the climate stuff that i\u2019m into and then like the environmental stuff that i\u2019m into", "basically i post the environmental stuff is all the stuff i care about, and then i post just enough climate so that everyone doesn\u2019t leave", "and is that \u2013 what is the url for that", "facebook.com/alex honnold, i think", "okay", "could it be just search for it, it\u2019s like a fan page; it\u2019s like several hundred thousand people or whatever", "h-o-n-n-o-l-d", "yeah", "well, alex, i really appreciate you taking the time", "i\u2019ve been hoping to meet you for a long time, given that we\u2019re not that far apart oftentimes with yosemite", "yes", "it\u2019s surprising", "so this has been fun and once i fix my elbows maybe i\u2019ll see if i can tackle a few \u2013 yeah, you should [inaudible]", "and maybe actually get out of doors, which i would enjoy", "right", "so yeah, i will hopefully do more than a three-day meditation retreat, given that you\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years", "i think i might extend my ambitions a little bit", "but thanks very much, i really appreciate it", "yeah", "no, thanks for having me", "a pleasure", "and everybody listening
