This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show, where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers of all types to tease out the habits, routines, beliefs \u2013 sometimes very strong beliefs \u2013 that they have, or philosophies that you can apply in your everyday life and take for a test drive. This episode is a treat; it was a lot of fun to do. My guest is Kara Swisher, @karaswisher on Twitter, K-A-R-A, S-W-I-S-H-E-R. She\u2019s been called \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s most feared and well liked journalist\u201d by New York magazine, specifically Benjamin Wallace. That is such a good headline and it\u2019s an even better piece, so I suggest you check that out as well. Here\u2019s just one example of why she\u2019s feared and respected. You can graph the impact on Yahoo\u2019s stock price of various posts by Kara. That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. She attended Georgetown\u2019s School prior to changing course to journalism. And as it turns out, many of the skills that would make a good spy, let\u2019s say, are the same that make a good journalist: developing sources, asking good questions, scenario planning, and much more. She forged her reputation at the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, and now she spends the majority of her time as Executive Editor of Recode, and the host of the Recode Decode podcast. Over the last 11 years and alongside Walt Mossberg, she\u2019s also produced D: All Things Digital, a major high-tech conference with interviewees such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and many other leading players in the tech and media industries. There\u2019s almost always \u2013 I think it probably is always a waiting list to attend this event. And in this podcast episode, she and I cover a lot of subjects, enjoy quite a few laughs, and dig into details you can readily apply and test yourself. Topics include the art and craft of good questions, lessons learned and favorite moments from interviewing Steve Jobs, some great war stories; what separates good from great journalists. Then we have more war stories, missed opportunities, and optimistic pessimism. It\u2019s very wide-ranging and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Kara Swisher. Kara, welcome to the show. Kara Swisher: Thank you, Tim. Tim Ferriss: I am so excited to be here. Kara Swisher: I am excited to be here even more so. Tim Ferriss: I would be lying if I said I weren\u2019t just a little nervous. Kara Swisher: Why is that? Tim Ferriss: Because you\u2019re so experienced and so good at asking questions. Kara Swisher: Well, you\u2019re saying manipulating people; yes I am fantastic at it so just accept that fact and let\u2019s move on. Tim Ferriss: Alright. So moving on, what separates in your mind a good journalist from a great journalist? Kara Swisher: You know, it\u2019s interesting. People ask me this all the time because I do tend to beat people a lot. It\u2019s pretty easy in lots of ways to do better than other people. And I think about it a lot. A lot of people think there\u2019s some special sauce, or some magic or you have a particular skill. I think there are skills that you can develop but I actually do think I just work harder than people. I just work harder and I try harder, and I am more persistent; I guess that would be it. Tim Ferriss: What do you do more of or less of, if you were to, say, compare your focus and the way you work to people who are unable to do what you do? Kara Swisher: They\u2019re lazy. I just really don\u2019t know how to put it. Two things. It\u2019s not just laziness; it\u2019s laziness and lack of observation and awareness. The skills that reporters should have are persistence, ability to ask questions, and just an ability to analyze. You know what I mean? I went to the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown; I was going to be a spy. And I do a lot of scenario building whenever I think about things, or when I\u2019m thinking about companies or businesses. So often when I\u2019m thinking about what some company is doing or what I want to cover, like for example Twitter and a sale; just anything. It could be any errant thing. I go: what would I do? What are those fuckers up to? What could they be up to? And there are ten things. There are not more than ten things they could be up to, and I follow every one as if it\u2019s the truth. Then I find the right one. It\u2019s really pretty easy. I think reporters are so reactive. Something happens and then they write it, and they tend to type it down. They never take a minute to analyze it; they never take a minute not to react, to imagine what people could be doing. So you can almost create your news if you start to get smarter about it. Most reporters literally just react and type. So that\u2019s what I find. Tim Ferriss: Why did you not become a spy? Kara Swisher: I wish I did. I was gay. At the time, it was hard. I\u2019m pretty old, Tim. I\u2019m 54. At the time, and people forget this and maybe it\u2019ll happen again but I don\u2019t think it will; it was hard to be gay. You had to be furtive and hidden. At the time I was somewhat hidden, not completely but enough. There was a price when you came out. There were all kinds of issues around being out and being in government at the time. Remember, we had Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell for awhile, which was insane. Before that, a lot of punitive things that would happen; your own family would be awful. I remember talking to someone at the time, and they were like: well, you obviously couldn\u2019t be deployed to Saudi Arabia because they hate gays; they want to kill gay people; they want to kill gay people across the world. And I was like: well, I don\u2019t speak Arabic so that wouldn\u2019t work out for me; that kind of thing. So it was just a constant thing I couldn\u2019t do, besides being a woman, also. So I think it was that. I think I would have been a good spy. I would be like Carrie Matheson without the bipolar. That\u2019s the kind of spy I would have wanted to be. Tim Ferriss: What drew you to that, and following that track in the first place? Kara Swisher: I studied at college and then later at journalism school at Columbia, propaganda. I\u2019m really interested in the uses of propaganda and the effectiveness of propaganda. It\u2019s probably why I\u2019m attracted to the internet because it\u2019s propaganda in a lot of ways. So I would study communist propaganda systems; Nazis, I was very interested in how the Nazis managed to [inaudible] \u2013 [Crosstalk] Kara Swisher: Yes. By no means admiration but it was effective. So I was really interested in how they could take a whole group of people and demonize them, the subtle norms of it; all the different things. So I was really interested in that. And I was interested in how people are fooled and tricked and how easy it is to manipulate people. I wanted to not do that and make things clear for people. I\u2019m both offended by propaganda and fascinated by it. I\u2019m doing it on a lesser level. I\u2019ve started to write about Trump a lot, which I think is more meaningful to me. With companies, like so-and-so, Yahoo tells you this: well, let me just actually tell you what\u2019s going on. Like, it\u2019s not precisely a lie but it certainly isn\u2019t the truth. And I think Silicon Valley is one of the places that tries to suspend disbelief almost all the time. Sometimes it\u2019s great because you have to believe in yourself, and other times it\u2019s just pure bullshit; more bullshit lately than anything else. Tim Ferriss: A lot of bullshit out there. Kara Swisher: Yeah, there is. Tim Ferriss: I would imagine part of discerning the truth and building up these scenarios, and traveling down, say, ten paths until you identify the proper story, the real story is sources. Kara Swisher: Right. Tim Ferriss: This all makes so much more sense now, thinking about the spy context. We\u2019ve landed in Beirut; how am I going to cultivate my sources? How do you cultivate sources? Kara Swisher: A couple things. There are tricks. You know, there are conversations and I do them actually without a lot of thinking about it. But if I had to think about it, I think I\u2019m pretty charming; I think I\u2019m interesting. A lot of reporters are transactional; I\u2019m not transactional. I don\u2019t say tell me this, give me this; that kind of thing. I conduct relationships with my sources over years, and I think they appreciate that. Because I sometimes give them information. I have a lot of information; I have a lot more than anybody, actually. So I don\u2019t trade information particularly, but I know things and I have insights. I had someone call me the other day that has been a very good source, who is a very well known person. They asked about something and I said no, no, you don\u2019t want to do that because of this. And they didn\u2019t know. And they\u2019re like: oh, thank you. I think this is the way you should do that. I\u2019m not giving them free advice or anything like that. It\u2019s just that I develop relationships the way you would talk to a person, anybody who you have a relationship with. And I\u2019m not ignorant; that\u2019s the other part. It\u2019s I know more than they do. I\u2019ll never forget, I was doing the book on AOL with Steve Case, and he was very restrictive. Restricting information is a trick that everybody uses. I\u2019m going to restrict the information and then you\u2019ll be at my beck and call. What I do is I interview hundreds of people. I interview everyone around him so I get all the stories. And at one point, he said something and I said no, actually it happened like this. And he\u2019s like, oh. And then we did it again. And it was like: no, no, actually I talked to this person and this is what happened. He goes: I have no control over you anymore, do I? And I go, no. That happened weeks ago. You have no fucking idea. So I use that. I use lots more information than other people have. I think I appeal to people\u2019s egos sometimes. But I do the opposite version, which is I insult them, which works beautifully. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s called negging. Kara Swisher: Negging. I\u2019m a really good negger. But I\u2019m really funny; I\u2019m a funny negger. One of the VCs recently had a facelift and nobody was saying anything, but everyone was talking about it. Tim Ferriss: Just the open secret. Kara Swisher: It wasn\u2019t open; it was a terrible facelift. So I went up to him and I said, \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on with your face?\u201d And he goes, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said \u201cYou had a facelift, clearly, and everyone\u2019s talking about it. I\u2019m just asking because I\u2019m curious why you did this horrible thing to your face.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI never had a facelift.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cCome on, stop, like please stop. What are you doing?\u201d I\u2019ll do stuff like that. I think people either like it, because I don\u2019t cut them down but when they say something dumb to me, I immediately go: you\u2019ve got to fucking be kidding me that you just said that. I was with a tech titan, from your book, Titans; I don\u2019t know if he was one of the Titans in your book. But I\u2019ve known this person for years. And you\u2019ve done a lot of people before they were billionaires, right? Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kara Swisher: Sacca is one that I\u2019ve known for many years. I\u2019ll tell you the one I did with him. We were at a party. I don\u2019t even think he remembers this. Whenever he\u2019d introduce him to me, I go, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t remember you.\u201d And I did. I did it all the time. And he\u2019d go, \u201cChris Sacca; we met.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just such a\u2026\u201d I blamed it on myself. Tim Ferriss: You pulled a Willy Wonka. Kara Swisher: That\u2019s right. What? I just\u2026 And he fell for it all the time. He finally caught on, I think, ultimately and then I stopped doing it. I just thought it was funny because it\u2019s so easy. Or you go to someone who says, \u201cOh, I went to Harvard.\u201d And I go, \u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cBoston.\u201d I go, \u201cOh, MIT is a great school.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cNo, Harvard.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d Because Harvard people always tell you. So I do stuff like that. A lot of it I do try to knock them down to size because I think what happens with Silicon Valley people who have gotten wealthy who I knew before that, they get licked up and down all day; they really do. Come on. You know what I mean? Like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re so smart.\u201d And they never think they\u2019re wrong, and they never can be challenged. I was with another one the other day, and I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t agree with that; it\u2019s wrong.\u201d And by the way, I was right. So they\u2019re like, well\u2026 And I\u2019m like, \u201cI know you get agreed with all day long but you\u2019re not always fucking right.\u201d Like, I\u2019m sorry; I knew you before when you were a normal person and nobody was kissing your ass all day. I\u2019ll get back to the tech titan. So we were talking at I think a TED or something like that, which I sometimes like part of it; I like a lot of it. But there\u2019s a lot of self actualization going on aggressively. Tim Ferriss: There\u2019s a lot of \u2013 Kara Swisher: Swanning. Tim Ferriss: \u2013 self back patting. Kara Swisher: Yeah, like aren\u2019t we great, over privileged people. So he started doing the downward facing dog in front of me while I was having a conversation. Tim Ferriss: Hold on. Just for context, this is not in an Astram or\u2026? Kara Swisher: No, it\u2019s just like where the water was in the steel bottles, like the area of steel bottled water because plastic is horrible. So he started doing yoga while I was talking. And I like yoga, and there\u2019s an appropriate place to do yoga. But I was looking at his ass in these horrible Juicy Couture pants. And I was like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s finish our conversation and then you can do your stupid downward facing dog; it\u2019s fine.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo one seems to mind.\u201d I go, \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a billionaire and they don\u2019t tell you you\u2019re an asshole, but you\u2019re an asshole. You don\u2019t do a downward facing dog in front of someone.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Especially ass facing. Kara Swisher: I know! But he had lost all perspective of behavior because everybody tolerates it, because they want to get on his plane, or they want something from him. And I think the last part in that vein is I don\u2019t want things from people. I don\u2019t need their love, I don\u2019t need their money, I don\u2019t need their acceptance or anything like that. I was with another guy who\u2019s a big deal in Hollywood, and he\u2019s like, \u201cDo you want to come to my party?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t; I\u2019m going to go to the movies.\u201d And I didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose; I wasn\u2019t interested in going to his party. He goes, well, do you want to meet this star? I\u2019m like, no. He\u2019s like, do you want to meet this star? No. I don\u2019t need to go to their house. That doesn\u2019t help my life. And literally he goes, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I have you want, is there?\u201d And I go, \u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t even want a prostitute. There\u2019s nothing I want.\u201d It was funny. So I think being really self aware of things, like don\u2019t get sucked into it has been really effective. So if they don\u2019t have anything to hold over you, you really do have a lot of power. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s a huge amount of leverage. Kara Swisher: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Have you always cared so little what other people think? Kara Swisher: Yes. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re talking about. I was going to say I think being gay has given me that gift in terms of\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s formed everything about me. But again, I grew up in an era where there was a lot of pushback and rejection. So you had to say I like who I am and I\u2019m going to keep doing that, and then just not care. So it sort of created a situation where if I cared what people thought about me being gay, I would have been just crushed. Then I just didn\u2019t care about that, and I thought it was actually quite nifty. Like wow, I\u2019m better than you, kind of thing. I think it started three, it really did because I knew I was gay when I was 4, and I was super happy with it, and I stayed happy with it. I think a lot of gay people of my era\u2026 I was at the cusp of it being accepted with a lot of struggle. The people before me, they went through terrible times. Because it\u2019s the only thing your family rejects. If you\u2019re black or Jewish, people get anti Semitism or racism; your family does. But your family is the one on the attack many times for people. So I think it started with that, and then I think I was just like that. I just didn\u2019t care what people thought of me. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s unusual for a woman, too because women are particularly pleasing, good girl; try to be a pleasing person. And I\u2019m always pressing people not to do that, especially women. A lot of people come to me and ask me about jobs, or what they should do or something like that. I try really hard to be mentors to people because I had a lot of great mentors, although I hate that word. They always come to me, like someone came to me recently and said I\u2019ve gotten this job offer and this job offer. I said, what do you want to do? They said well, this job offer\u2019s interesting. I was like, I didn\u2019t ask you that question; I asked you what do you want to do. They\u2019re like, well this job\u2026 I said no, that\u2019s what\u2019s being offered to you. That\u2019s over the transom, right? It\u2019s like being in a restaurant and they say we have chicken, we\u2019ve got pork, and we\u2019ve got beef and you can have one of those. Do you want spaghetti? Like maybe you want fucking spaghetti? And so it was really interesting. And they were like, oh, I never thought of that. Like, why are you taking what\u2019s handed to you? What would you like to do? At every point in my life where I have said what pleases me, I always get more successful. I don\u2019t know if you think this, but I don\u2019t like to take what\u2019s offered to me. Tim Ferriss: You know who made this point to me, has made this point to me over and over again is Matt Mullenweg. Kara Swisher: Yeah, he\u2019s great. Tim Ferriss: When someone says do you want A or B, he goes well, that\u2019s a false dichotomy. Or, why not C or D or E? And I agree with you 100 percent. I think if you\u2019re constantly choosing from the multiple choice test\u2026 Kara Swisher: Right, and people do that. It\u2019s amazing. You sort of fall into relationships. Like who offered you a date? Like instead of what do you like? Most people I\u2019ve gone out with, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019d like to go out with them. You know what I mean? Or what kind of person I want, that kind of thing. I think it limits your choice, essentially but at the same time\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget when I walked out of a building once when I was working on the book about AOL. I was in New York and it was one of those beautiful spring days. I had been working at the Washington Post and I was on the trajectory to go way high there. I was doing super well. I had taken the time to work on this book about AOL and the beginning of the internet, and the beginning of digital stuff. I remember walking out and it was bright, bright, bright. And I really believe in these moments, and I think people have to pay attention to them. I thought: I have to leave the Washington Post. I have to leave. Tim Ferriss: It was just an epiphany. Kara Swisher: It was an epiphany. And it wasn\u2019t like God, like whoa; it wasn\u2019t like that. It was like: it\u2019s time to go. I\u2019ve got to do something else. I\u2019m not going to grow. And I remember thinking everyone in the building was in the same seat and they weren\u2019t going anywhere. And I remember thinking going in, like nobody\u2019s moving and I have to move; I have to go. Same thing when I left the Journal. It was like: I\u2019ve got to go. It\u2019s time to go. I want to do something else that\u2019s better for me. I\u2019m becoming difficult with people. I started to get super rude to my bosses, which I do periodically. So I thought I shouldn\u2019t have a boss. Not having a boss is a good idea because it makes me a lesser person. And I don\u2019t like their opinions, kind of stuff. Tim Ferriss: If you, say, had \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be a woman but you mentioned having had mentors. If a woman came up to you, or one of your sons for that matter, and they cared too much about what other people thought\u2026 Kara Swisher: I hate that. Tim Ferriss: And they asked for help, though. They said what should I do? How can I train myself? What would you say to them? Kara Swisher: I just had this conversation with someone very close to me about two days ago about this because they were talking about how social media informs them too much. They said I wonder if I\u2019m more influenced by the outside or the inside, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m more\u2026 you know, like photos on Facebook or people being happy. We had discussed this issue before, and it\u2019s absolutely true; that\u2019s exactly what was happening. I was like, those pictures aren\u2019t real. That\u2019s their best side. That doesn\u2019t mean what\u2019s actually going on. There\u2019s lots of unhappiness in there, and not just necessarily unhappiness but it\u2019s not true. That\u2019s the photo; it\u2019s not the true thing that\u2019s happening. So just because I\u2019m a reporter, I know that\u2019s not the real story. So I\u2019m always thinking that people\u2026 It\u2019s a thing I use a lot. When I was a young reporter, I used to think what are people lying to me about? And then to become a great reporter, what are people lying to themselves about every day? What do they need to lie about to get through the day? And so I think that\u2019s the stronger thing, and I think people do that all the time. I tell myself the truth a lot; like that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not feeling that. Today I was mad at someone; I was like, I\u2019m fucking pissed. I think most people: oh, don\u2019t be pissed. And so what I tell my sons, because my oldest son is a real pleaser; I really don\u2019t like that about him. He\u2019s really worried about what people think. He\u2019s a teenager; I get it. But I was like, what this errant person thinks about you, 20 years from now you\u2019re not even going to remember that person and it doesn\u2019t matter what they think about you. It\u2019s hard to see into the future but I promise you, what this person said about you doesn\u2019t matter even slightly for a second. So I don\u2019t know how you get out of it. But if you start to realize that the best instinct is first yourself, and then people you really trust, and even people you really trust don\u2019t give you great advice sometimes. If you trust in your own self, you often can not feel bad when people come after you. Tim Ferriss: I was chatting just yesterday with this gent I\u2019d been hoping to talk to for decades, Dr. Phil Zimbardo. He\u2019s a professional emeritus at Stanford. He ran the Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971. Kara Swisher: Oh, wow. He didn\u2019t want to talk to you? Tim Ferriss: No, I had dreamed of speaking with him for decades but hadn\u2019t pursued him. I was going to say I thought he was dead; he\u2019s 83. He\u2019s not dead; he\u2019s very much alive and busier than ever. But he researches and writes a lot about how to mitigate damaging conformity and this subservience to power. He brought up this exercise that he calls \u201cdeviant for a day.\u201d He said, \u201cJust get an erasable black marker and draw a square on your forehead and walk around all day, and resist the pressure that you\u2019re going to get from everyone to take it off.\u201d He has a series of exercises like that. Kara Swisher: That\u2019s a great idea. Tim Ferriss: And it reminded me of what Kato, thousands of years ago, used to do. He was considered the perfect stoic bicennica but he would wear, for instance, a tunic. He would wear clothing that was of an unfashionable color to illicit ridicule from other people deliberately to develop an immunity. He did that just routinely to develop that tolerance. Kara Swisher: Yeah, I do that myself. I wear boys\u2019 tee shirts. I like them. So a lot of people like my mom, all these people go: oh, why do you have to do something like that? I\u2019m like, fuck you, I like it. And they\u2019re like, well\u2026 I\u2019m like, no, fuck you, I\u2019m going to wear it. I think part of me, I wear it because it bothers people sometimes. Or my glasses; I wear my sunglasses. Now, I have super bad eyes and I I have dry eyes so I can\u2019t wear contacts. That\u2019s more information than you need, but\u2026 And I have light sensitivity a little; I just don\u2019t like bright lights. So I wear my sunglasses a lot of places, and they\u2019re always aviators, which people know me for. People constantly have to comment when I have them on. \u201cWell, do you have to have them on?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d They expect me to take them off that minute. Like, \u201cWell, can\u2019t you take them off?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d Like photographers are like, \u201cWell, can\u2019t you take them off for a second?\u201d I go, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d They\u2019re not used to people not being cooperative. It\u2019s really interesting because I really like not being cooperative if it\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to do. And I make jokes, now. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m trying to avoid intimacy.\u201d You know, stuff like that so they\u2019ll get the fuck off my case. But I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not taking off my fucking glasses; it\u2019s not happening.\u201d But it\u2019s really interesting how quickly pressure, how quickly you do to pressure. I almost feel sometimes that I\u2019m somewhat too rude. It\u2019s not a New Yorker thing. I\u2019m from New York but it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just people really try to impose their opinions on you almost continually. I have this thing that sometimes I say things, and I literally say something; I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, did I just say that out loud?\u201d Like, you\u2019re an asshole? And I\u2019m sort of like whoa, I just said it out loud. So I think sometimes I should not do that; sometimes. Tim Ferriss: A few things to underscore. No. 1, I will defend your Wolverine shirt any day. Kara Swisher: Isn\u2019t it great? There\u2019s a new movie coming out. Tim Ferriss: Logan. I love Wolverine. Kara Swisher: So do I. He\u2019s so bad! Tim Ferriss: I was so worried. I\u2019ll digress for a second since you brought up the movie. Kara Swisher: Please! Tim Ferriss: I was so worried as a devout comic book nerd for my entire upbringing that they were going to cast somebody terrible for Wolverine. Kara Swisher: No, he\u2019s perfect. Tim Ferriss: Then when they got Hugh, oh, my God. He\u2019s perfect. Kara Swisher: He\u2019s perfect, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s perfect. I don\u2019t like when they make him cute, though. I like him really unhappy. Tim Ferriss: Gruff and surly. Kara Swisher: I\u2019m excited about this next one. I watch those over and over again. I love the movies. The last one wasn\u2019t so good, sadly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Hugh\u2019s a machine. The question I wanted to ask is you mentioned the Sacca story. You mentioned a few things, the downward facing dog story. Kara Swisher: Oh, God. I\u2019ll never forget that ass. Tim Ferriss: That seemed to reflect, and I\u2019d love for you to correct me if this isn\u2019t accurate, but an ability to throw people off of autopilot that I would imagine helps you do what you do. Kara Swisher: Yeah, absolutely. I do it on purpose. I do it naturally; I don\u2019t calculate it. A story written about me in New York magazine, Mark Anderson called it \u201cStockholm Syndrome.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Where you learn to love your captors? Kara Swisher: Yeah. He goes, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. She literally will call me up and make me insecure and angry, and I tell her exactly what she wants to know.\u201d He goes, \u201cI think it\u2019s the Stockholm Syndrome. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening.\u201d I think they don\u2019t get challenged, a lot of them. But then I agree when they\u2019re right. Like, I don\u2019t go \u201cyou\u2019re an idiot\u201d almost continually. I have said this before: smart people like to be challenged and they like smart people challenging them. If all day you get silly, stupid puffy questions, you\u2019re bored out of your mind. And if someone doesn\u2019t agree with you, you grow. If they\u2019re disagreeing with you just to be disputatious, that\u2019s different. I was having a meeting at someone with Google about Twitter or something; I was just asking questions. They were giving me the pap smear \u2013 pap smear, oh, my God, that\u2019s a terrible word. You know, the pap, like well\u2026 And I was like, \u201cAlright, you don\u2019t believe any of that, right? Can we get to the actual thing?\u201d And it was really funny. The minute I did that, it gave them permission to act like a real person. You know what I mean? The other thing I don\u2019t do is I don\u2019t use everything. I\u2019ll talk off the record with people for hours, and I don\u2019t use it. I file it away for later. I don\u2019t sneak up on them. I think one of the things that\u2019s really effective for a great reporter is they see me coming. I\u2019m not sneaky. Tim Ferriss: You don\u2019t ambush them. Kara Swisher: I don\u2019t; there\u2019s no reason. I tell them exactly what I\u2019m going to do. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. The only person I haven\u2019t been able to do that with is Marissa Mayer, who won\u2019t speak to me, which is to her detriment. She should have spoken to me. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve heard \u2013 Kara Swisher: Because I\u2019ve been accurate. Tim Ferriss: Was this in the New York mag piece when they talked about how Yahoo has been able to stock price in timing with your pieces? Kara Swisher: Yeah. Well, they\u2019ve been accurate pieces. Recently, I broke the story about the breach, the first breach. And I heard about it, and this wasn\u2019t some dumb company she bought and frittered away $10 million, which offends me as a shareholder too. This was a serious breach of people\u2019s privacy and everything else. So I called them, and they never call back, which just drives me crazy. They can\u2019t even say no comment. So I called them at night. I left a message for a PR person, and I said, \u201cListen, this is fucking serious. This isn\u2019t like a game I\u2019m playing right now. This isn\u2019t a dumb, little acquisition. This isn\u2019t someone leaving. This is 500 million people affected; you need to respond to me. You absolutely have to.\u201d Because they had written me an email. It wasn\u2019t no comment; it was some weird comment. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to print this entire email exchange if you do not call me back. Because I\u2019m going to show how ridiculously badly you\u2019re managing your company because this is not a little thing; this is a material issue.\u201d They did respond, finally. I was just kind of pissed off. We tried really hard to get them to respond and to get them to react to things we think are accurate. And by the way, everything we\u2019ve written has been accurate and has turned out exactly the way we said it was because we spent a lot of time analyzing and thinking about how it\u2019s going to go. I think non-engagement and non-response is really the worst thing anybody can do to someone like me. Tim Ferriss: How do you, as a very smart, very strong-willed person illicit honest feedback from people? Or perhaps put another way, who do you rely on to tell you when you\u2019re wrong? Kara Swisher: Me? Lots of people. I do listen. Tim Ferriss: Oh, no, I\u2019m sure you listen. I can imagine people being intimidated. Kara Swisher: Right. You\u2019d be surprised. People will \u2013 I think because I\u2019m forthright, they become more forthright. I think people suddenly get permission. Tim Ferriss: Right, they snap out of it. Kara Swisher: They snap out of the dream. Tim Ferriss: Okay, real talk. Kara Swisher: Right. One phrase I use a lot when they say something to me that I think is just not accurate, or untrue, or sort of half-assed, I say I don\u2019t believe you. What? You think I\u2019m lying? No, I just think you\u2019re not telling the truth, which is the same thing, right? I think once they start to do that, they do calculate that they have things to say. Tim Ferriss: I apologize for interjecting but could you give an example of when you might use that \u201cI don\u2019t believe you?\u201d Kara Swisher: Oh, with Steve Jobs all the time, like on the stage. They had gone after a blog, or some memo that had gotten leaked. The memo was accurate but they went after this small, little blogger who had written about it. I can\u2019t even remember; you never remember the circumstances of these dumb, crazy crises at the time. But they had gone after an internal memo, or they had gotten something but they were really attacking this small thing. And the issue was the thing was totally accurate. That pissed me off. It was accurate. It wasn\u2019t like they did something wrong or something like that. And I was on the stage asking about this. And he said, \u201cWell, you know, we have internal people, we have other things.\u201d And I said, \u201cWould you have done that to me?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I go, \u201cIf I had done it, would you have done it to me and Wall?\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo.\u201d And I said, \u201cSo you\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re weak and you can get them, right?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYes.\u201d Tim Ferriss: Wow. Kara Swisher: There was no other way to put it; he wouldn\u2019t have done it to me. And a place where I didn\u2019t do it this year, and I\u2019ve regretted every minute. I was interviewing Cheryl Sandberg at Cove this year, and it was about Peter Thiel going after Gawker. I don\u2019t agree with what he did, obviously, and I didn\u2019t like the secretiveness of it. I thought if he really felt that way, he should have done it publicly and not given us lectures about journalism and then did it on the sly. Because if he hadn\u2019t won, you never would have heard he did it; you know that. So the secretiveness really got to me. And also, Facebook is supposedly friends to publishers, and here\u2019s one of their board members killing off a publisher that didn\u2019t just have one property, they had ten properties and hundreds and hundreds of employees working at other places. So he had no thought to that. He just wanted to punish this one property in this media group and this one man, Nick Denton. I just wish he had been honest about what he was doing. Like, I\u2019m an asshole; I\u2019m going to go after them because I\u2019m rich as fuck. You know, whatever; just something that was just a little more honest. I was interviewing Cheryl, and she said this has nothing to do with Peter being on the Facebook board; it\u2019s his thing that he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s what she said. It was a perfect Cheryl Sandberg answer because she\u2019s real good at that. She sort of answers but not really. She\u2019s fantastic in her self control over herself. What I should have said right then is \u201cWould you have done it, because they\u2019ve attacked you a lot. Would you have done it?\u201d I think I would have caught her. She would have had to say no. She\u2019d have to say no. I should have gotten her on the record saying no, I would not have. Even if I hated them, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. So I think that was a missed opportunity. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned Steve Jobs. I\u2019d love to get your take on what the components of a reality distortion field are, or charisma, just more broadly speaking. Kara Swisher: Charisma is what I\u2019d say. I think people like to do that reality distortion because you don\u2019t have to believe him. Everyone was like, oh I had to believe him; like he had some magical kind of mojo. I didn\u2019t find him that way at all. He was just doing his thing and he was better at it than other people. I think he was persuasive, I would say, and he was charismatic; aggressively charismatic, I guess. He was also certain all the time. One time on stage, I said, \u201cWalter, are you going to do a phone?\u201d And he said, \u201cAbsolutely not; I am not good at jumping through orifices,\u201d which is a great word. You know he had thought about it because you don\u2019t come up with orifice easily. It was like, I don\u2019t like to jump through assholes; that\u2019s really what he was saying in a really clever way. And literally the next year he introduced the iphone, so it was like you\u2019re a fucking liar. We were like, you lied. And he was like, I did. It was like he didn\u2019t hide it. he didn\u2019t even say, \u201cI didn\u2019t lie precisely.\u201d He knew what he did. Because they had been clearly working on it. But he went out of his way to lie; that was my favorite part. People sometimes got offended about it but I didn\u2019t care. He was a showman; it didn\u2019t matter. I think one of the things people got wrong about him, and he was difficult. I didn\u2019t work with him but he definitely had the temper, and had opinions, and very strong opinions; he could be very cutting, but so can a lot of people. I don\u2019t think he was any more than anybody else, necessarily. He\u2019s just more famous and therefore people knew it. People always said he was heartless. I think he had too much heart, like he cared too much. So had so much heart that he just couldn\u2019t stand it when things weren\u2019t right. When I started looking at him that way, it made a lot more sense to me. And again, I didn\u2019t know him personally very well. I interviewed him nine or ten times, and Walt knew him much better. But I think he just had a lot of heart, and it was overwhelming to him. And he had a lot of feelings and he never hid them. One time when we were backstage together, I have a son and my partner Megan at the time, we had two kids; same father. We each had a baby. He asked a lot of questions about it, like do you know the father? It was unusual. Most tech people don\u2019t ask me personal questions, and he was really curious. Then I realized he was adopted and didn\u2019t know his parents. He told the story of what happened about finding his father and not liking his father. This was way before the Walter Isaacson book. There was a fascinating story that he told better than it ever was told after he died about how he found his parents. He had talked about about his adoptive parents being hurt by his seeking the parents, which is totally understandable. And that your biological parents aren\u2019t necessarily you\u2019re parents. It was this whole thing; it was fascinating. And that I shouldn\u2019t let my kids look for the father necessarily. It was so unusual, and it wasn\u2019t unwelcome; it was really interesting because I didn\u2019t know him that well. But he was so passionate and heartfelt about it. And then he hugged us all. It was so strange. I think he was probably in an emotional period around his illness at the time, but it was really fascinating because hew as like \u201cyour parent isn\u2019t your parent and you should not think that.\u201d One of the things that struck me, I\u2019ll never forget it. He talked about the good thing that came out of it was he met his full sister, because his parents had had a child after they put him up for adoption. You really got insight into him because you thought they never went back for them, did they? They had another kid so it was even more troubled. So you do understand that had to inform him. Maybe he\u2019d poo-poo him but I would think that would have to inform him, the anger of being left behind. Interestingly enough, he was very close friends with Larry Ellison, who had a similar experience with his mother who had left him; he told me the story of that. I do spend a lot of time thinking about people\u2019s past and how it impacts them going forward. Tim Ferriss: I never met Steve but I heard a story that reflects him being a man of strong emotions but at points, really caring for people. This was from an old timer at Apple. I was in Cupertino and he said, \u201cDo you see that ATM over there?\u201d We were having lunch. I go, \u201cYeah, I see the ATM.\u201d Because at one point there was a story going around about Steve because this extremely overweight guy who was 300-and something pounds was getting money out of the ATM and he heard, \u201cWhat are you doing to yourself? You\u2019re killing yourself.\u201d And he turned around and it was Steve Jobs. And Steve said, \u201cThis is my office\u2019s number. I want you to call. We\u2019re getting you a trainer; you can\u2019t do this to yourself.\u201d Kara Swisher: I love that. I don\u2019t mind that. He definitely had difficulties and people like to tear people down. He never pretended he wasn\u2019t kind of an asshole sometimes, so I kind of like that; I like people like that. So people always aid he wasn\u2019t as big a hero, and I said I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a hero; I think he\u2019s fascinating. We tend to try to cartoonize people, and not make them complex and have complexity. Another reason I\u2019m a good reporter is I understand complexity and that there are a lot of different personalities at once. I love that. I did that recently. I say things right out loud. I was at an airport. Someone in front of me who was overweight, and I shouldn\u2019t have done this but I wasn\u2019t calling them fat; I just didn\u2019t want them to do it. And they said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to have the crueler. Give me the muffin because it\u2019s healthy.\u201d And I went, \u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d They were like, what? I said, \u201cIt\u2019s full of sugar, carbs. It\u2019s so much more caloric. Just get the candy bar. Just get the candy bar. If you want sugar, just get the fucking candy bar; it\u2019s better, it tastes better. You don\u2019t want that bran muffin because it sucks for you.\u201d It literally was like\u2026 and she\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s not your business.\u201d And I said, \u201cJust don\u2019t eat it. Please, just have the candy bar. I know you want sugar so go for it.\u201d I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not anti sugar and I should be anti sugar but it was like really fascinating. I did the same thing. And I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019ve got to shut up. But then I didn\u2019t want her to eat it. You know what I mean? Like you see the steps. So I kind of like it that he did that. Tim Ferriss: Have you ever hit someone too hard in coverage or a story? Kara Swisher: Physically, never. Tim Ferriss: No, not physically. Kara Swisher: Not yet. Tim Ferriss: In a story and regretted it, or on stage? Kara Swisher: No. Tim Ferriss: No? Okay. Kara Swisher: No. No, I actually do hold back. A good one is Marissa Mayers. Remember that story when she slept through the meeting? I had that story. I didn\u2019t write it. I thought she might be pregnant. I\u2019ve been tired and pregnant before. I thought she just overslept. I thought it was sexist because a lot of Google male executives skip meetings all the time and nobody gives a fuck. I\u2019ve held back on stories. That was one I held back on. She\u2019d never know that. Same thing with a lot of that stuff around her divaness, calling her Evita. I never came across that, nor would I write it. Anything that\u2019s personal and not pertinent, I don\u2019t put in. And I know a lot of stuff. So no, I actually don\u2019t do the hits. I will only hit on their financial performance. Every now and then I can make a joke, you know, like Jerry Yang. I said \u201craise the Yang ten,\u201d like I have funny headlines. But they\u2019re funny; they\u2019re meant to be funny, not necessarily cruel. I don\u2019t think anything I\u2019ve written is necessarily cruel. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t have anything in mind. Kara Swisher: I would have to go back. I\u2019m sure someone could find something. I think Trumplethinskin is funny, you know what I mean? I think it\u2019s funny. So I tend to go for funny more than stuff like that. I just did a recent piece about Peter Thiel when he was giving that idiotic speech at the National Press Club. Everyone just typed it, like just typed what he said, and I didn\u2019t. I said he says this, and he talks about privacy and his money is made from two of the most privacy attacking companies around; Facebook and [inaudible]. Like come on, let\u2019s just give some context. I don\u2019t think I let people get away with things. I\u2019m trying to think of something that\u2019s cruel and I can\u2019t think of one, no. Tim Ferriss: Do you remember the first piece or the first story that you were involved with where you thought to yourself: I think I could really be good at this; I think I could do this full time? Was there a moment? Kara Swisher: A lot of them. I was pretty good in college. It sounds crazy; I won something called the Bun Award, [inaudible] in college when I was a freshman in the newspaper. It was won by a senior and I won it as a freshman and I remember thinking, yeah, I\u2019m really good. Tim Ferriss: What did you write about? Kara Swisher: I wrote columns about college life and stuff like that, and they were funny and they were pointed. I didn\u2019t let the Jesuits get away with as much as other people did. And so I think when I called the Washington Post, there\u2019s a pretty famous story of me calling Larry Kramer who was the Metro editor at the time. I had covered a story that they had covered, and theirs was full of errors and it made me mad. I called them and said you suck. He goes, \u201cDo you think you could do it better?\u201d I said, \u201cI absolutely could.\u201d And I went down and I got a job. He hired me on the spot. So that kind of thing worked out well. I think I wrote a series of stories for the Washington Post, and Ben Bradley loved them so that was the best thing ever; talk about crack, having him come over and go, \u201cGreat job, kid!\u201d That was like wow, this is my dream. It wasn\u2019t Watergate but I covered retail, and there was a family in Washington called the Halves. I did a great job covering their fighting. I wrote it like it was King Lear. It was a great job. I really got to the emotions and the complexity, and power, and money and there was sex involved. So it was a great story and I wrote it that way, and it was my natural instinct to do it. Young reporters didn\u2019t do that. He wanted to know every day what the next chapter was and I began to see that I was super good at narrative, which I think reporters aren\u2019t. They don\u2019t think of it as an ongoing story. So I approach a lot of stories like narratives, like what\u2019s the next chapter. So when he would come in every day and say \u201cWhat have you got for me today?\u201d he wanted to know. I thought that was a really powerful way to tell a story so I thought I was good at it from the beginning. Tim Ferriss: Maybe you\u2019ve taught; I don\u2019t know offhand, I apologize. But if you were to teach a college freshman seminar in journalism or writing\u2026 Kara Swisher: I\u2019m a terrible teacher, but yeah. I taught at Berkeley and I was terrible. Tim Ferriss: Why were you terrible? Kara Swisher: Because I was like, they didn\u2019t know how to do it. They\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, how do I do this?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you. I learned all by myself. No one taught me.\u201d I\u2019m a terrible person; I\u2019m just the worst teacher. It\u2019s just not my nature. Tim Ferriss: Okay, I can take a different angle. If you were to recommend any books to people who are aspiring writers or journalists, are there any that come to mind? Kara Swisher: Strunk and White\u2019s The Elements of Style. I reread it every year. It\u2019s a great book; it still is. I think anything by Joan Didion in the early years; Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The White Album are two of my favorite books. Slouching Towards Bethlehem I read over and over again, like three or four times a year. It\u2019s so beautifully constructed. She\u2019s so wise. She involves herself in the stories a little bit more and is very descriptive. I\u2019m remembering when you said what do you remember, I remember I wrote a story about this company in Washington when I was at the Washington Post about a really expensive \u2013 all of a sudden these luxury grocery stores were getting started. This was not a thing. Now, they\u2019re everywhere. But I covered retail and my lead, which they didn\u2019t want to keep but I insisted on, was \u201cHere in the land of the four-dollar tomato.\u201d I loved it. I thought it was funny. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s good lead. Kara Swisher: It was, wasn\u2019t it? The best lead I ever wrote, and I\u2019ll never write a better lead than this, it always worked and a lot of people didn\u2019t want me to put it on there. So trusting my own instincts on what people like, I was writing about Discovery, which had just gotten started in Washington, the Discovery Channel. This was many years ago and the founder was a guy named John Hendrix. He founded it and he was trying to get on cable systems, and it was all about how he tried to get on cable systems. At the time, it was super hard and he had to rely on John Malone and stuff like that. It\u2019s kind of a boring, dry story. And I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s been the secret to your success?\u201d Like you do, I ask what\u2019s been the thing that\u2019s worked for you. And he goes, \u201cSharks and Nazis, Nazis and sharks; thank God for Nazis and sharks.\u201d Because they have Nazi shark week. And I made that the lead: Sharks and Nazis, Nazis and sharks; thank God for Nazis and sharks. It was literally the best quote I\u2019ve ever gotten. I\u2019ll never get a quote like that again. Tim Ferriss: I thought it was going to be a Haiku. Kara Swisher: No, it was like: you\u2019re right, Nazis and sharks. But the juxtaposition of Nazis and sharks, and people love Nazi documentaries; you can\u2019t get enough Nazi documentaries, right? People can\u2019t! There\u2019s something with Nazi documentaries and sharks. Tim Ferriss: Or movies in general. Kara Swisher: You\u2019ve got to watch them, and sharks are the same thing. So they had Shark Week. Then I got into what happened when Shark Week and Nazi Week happened from a business point of view. That was super good. That was a super good day. But a lot of people didn\u2019t want me to do it, which was interesting. The same thing happened at the Wall Street Journal years later. There was a guy named Greg Zachary who really helped me there, and he probably doesn\u2019t even remember. But I had been trying to differentiate myself. I was trying to get to the culture of Silicon Valley, and nobody was covering Silicon Valley then in 1995, 1997, maybe. I was trying to get to the culture of it because I thought the culture was super important; not just the business stories that drive Yahoo today and earn as much money. Everywhere I went, two things they did. One was whenever I\u2019d go out with them, they\u2019d take me to a crappy taco place. They\u2019d never take me to a real restaurant. I was like, what is wrong with these people? So I wrote a story about their favorite places to eat. Like, this is an unusual culture. Unlike Hollywood moguls or Wall Street moguls, these people eat at taco joints. Tim Ferriss: Not taking you to Spago\u2019s. Kara Swisher: No, but it was taco joints. So I did a whole thing of taco joints that these up and coming Mark Andreesen or Yang loved, or Joe Krauss at the time at Excite. Then I wrote another one about their idiotic titles they had to put on themselves. I thought it reflected them a lot. They had like Chief Yahoo, or Chief Experience Officers. They have a bunch of dumb, fucking titles. Tim Ferriss: Sure, oh yeah. Kara Swisher: And so I wrote a story, and it wasn\u2019t quite like the Journal to do that. And Greg just lied and got it in; like we\u2019re going to publish these and we\u2019re going to tell them it was approved. Do you know what I mean? He was a pretty powerful reporter at the time. I learned a lot from that, like \u201cFuck \u2018em, you\u2019re gonna shove that thing right in there.\u201d I liked that. He was really helpful to me in that regard. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve been involved with a lot of live events. What makes a great event? Kara Swisher: It\u2019s theater. People don\u2019t think it but it\u2019s theater. I\u2019m a big theater fan. I used to write a column about theater for the Washington Post on the side. I love theater. I went from when I was a kid. My mom took me to all kinds of live events, especially Broadway and stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: Any favorite shows? Kara Swisher: All of them. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t like on stage. Well, that\u2019s not true. There was a Rollerblade show that Andrew Lloyd Webber did that was just awful. But it was good in its ridiculousness. I love Angels in America; I\u2019ve seen it dozens and dozens of times. I love every iteration of Angels in America. It was long; it was three hours or whatever. I did like Hamilton a lot. I was not expecting that. I was expecting it not to be as good. I thought it was wonderful. It was very traditional. Even though it was rap, it was a traditional musical. I like everything. I like stage work a lot. I think about, again, the narrative of a conversation. A lot of people ask a question, get an answer; ask a question, get an answer. I have a conversation, and it\u2019s a narrative conversation. It\u2019s story telling. I ask questions people don\u2019t expect, and questions people want to know. It\u2019s not Oprah-like. She\u2019s real good. She\u2019s an amazing interviewer. Tim Ferriss: She\u2019s brilliant. Kara Swisher: One time with Steve Jobs, I\u2019ll never forget and I think people remember it to this day, this question. He said something and it was right near the end. We did the interview months before he died. It was interesting because you\u2019d see him better and worse over the years. If you look at the pictures, there\u2019s one year where he has some weight on him; another year no and then the last year he was just skeletal and it was sad. But at the same time, he had more vibrance than everybody on that stage; I\u2019ll tell you that. That was really striking. And a lot of people, when someone\u2019s dying or sick, try to pretend that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Do you know what I mean? Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Kara Swisher: Like, let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re not very, very ill, here. And I asked two questions people did remember. I said, \u201cWhat do you do all day? What\u2019s a Steve Jobs day like?\u201d I just wanted to know. I just was like, he\u2019s going to be dead soon, or he looks very sick and what does he do all day? Like you were asking people what do they do the first 60 minutes of the day. I wanted to know, what does he do? Does he get up, does he eat breakfast? And he answered it; it was great. It was really great. Then I asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do with the rest of your life?\u201d And everyone was like\u2026 sharp intake of breath; like don\u2019t you care? That\u2019s insensitive. And I was like, I want to know. He had a wonderful answer. It was about television, of all things. He wanted to change television. It was so great that he had that ambition when it was possibly clear that\u2026 Who knows when people are going to die but he looked real ill. He just started to come alive talking about television and how to change television. He was great. Walt told me later when he talked to him on the phone, right before he died, he was still talking about how it pissed him off and it was great. He lived right up until he died. So not asking the questions that you really want to know, I think reporters, people on stage don\u2019t do that. So when I want to know something, I\u2019m just curious. And I also treat them like people, not potentates, you know what I mean? I imagine very day they have problems like I do. I\u2019ll treat the president the same I would a janitor that I\u2019m interviewing. I\u2019m not rude to the janitor; I\u2019m not rude to the president. So that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s useful. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any particular routines or habits, rituals on a daily basis or otherwise that are important to you? Kara Swisher: Yeah, unfortunately. We were just talking before on my podcast about picking up the phone. I\u2019ve got to stop that. I feel it. I feel that I\u2019m really wasting my time. It\u2019s addictive, and I\u2019m not an addictive personality. I don\u2019t drink; I don\u2019t take drugs. We won\u2019t go to the sex; that\u2019s possibly the most addictive part of my personality. But I have to stop. It\u2019s sucking time away. That\u2019s such a clich\u00e9 but it truly is; there\u2019s something happening to my brain that\u2019s getting rewired. It\u2019s dopamine, I think. That must be it, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there\u2019s dopamine involved. There\u2019s also serotonin involved in, say, social media hits and so on. Kara Swisher: But it doesn\u2019t feel good. It\u2019s not a feel-good feeling. It\u2019s not pleasing. When I have a cookie, I\u2019m happy. It\u2019s kind of interesting, or ice cream. My kid, I\u2019ll never forget giving him ice cream for the first time. He tasted it and you could see his face: what? What? Oh, my God. Like you could see the look; it was physical, it was mental, it was everything. You don\u2019t get pleasure from this stuff. I\u2019m not happier. It\u2019s entertaining and it\u2019s addictive so I feel like I have to stop that. I\u2019ve got to figure out how to do it because I do have a job where people do have to get in touch with me, and sometimes immediately. Tim Ferriss: Right. Kara Swisher: So I\u2019m trying to figure out, like the ding-ding of the phone, I try to turn on the thing and then I don\u2019t want to hear from people. I\u2019ve got to correct things because I fil up my days way too much. I feel like I\u2019m overscheduled. Tim Ferriss: You may be overscheduled. At the same time, you\u2019ve been extremely productive in your work and your career. Kara Swisher: Yeah, I\u2019m super productive. Tim Ferriss: And you\u2019ve made choices along the way to break from certain things, start new projects. Kara Swisher: Always. I always break. Tim Ferriss: So how do you choose? If you could walk us through your thought process, how do you choose which projects to take on and which to say no to? Kara Swisher: It\u2019s interesting, and maybe you disagree with this; people go through creative periods. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I agree 100 percent. Kara Swisher: This month, I\u2019m really creative. I don\u2019t know what happened. I\u2019ve started a column and its really good. And someone just said what happened to you? There are some things that went on in my life, but I don\u2019t know what. Oh I do know; I have some ideas but it\u2019s really interesting to go through those periods. Right now, I\u2019m not saying no to any idea because it\u2019s super creative. I have an idea for a book, finally, that I like. People are always trying to get me to write books. And part of me is like oh, write another book, like Uber, with Yahoo. Then I want to shoot myself in the eye. I could write that in my sleep but I don\u2019t want to do it. I decline to do it. So I have an idea that just suddenly hit me and I was like, I\u2019m going to do this. So I was doing that. And we\u2019re working on a TV show, and I\u2019m kind of interested in it. Tim Ferriss: You said no to the Uber or Yahoo book. Kara Swisher: I have for the last couple of months. I get offered books all the time. Tim Ferriss: If you got offered that book in January, would you have said yes? Kara Swisher: No. Tim Ferriss: Why not? What\u2019s the thought? Just not stimulating? Kara Swisher: I\u2019d hate myself. I\u2019d be bored. I couldn\u2019t do it. You know know when you can\u2019t? I actually don\u2019t do things I can\u2019t do. Years ago I had an assignment for Glamour magazine; write ten things, ten interesting people. I couldn\u2019t do it. I refused to do it. It was weird. I was like well, if I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t do it. It was a lot of money. So money doesn\u2019t motivate me, so that\u2019s hard. It never did and it doesn\u2019t anymore because I\u2019ve got plenty. I\u2019ve got to be interested in it. sometimes I like things because it makes me famous. I like being famous. Maybe that\u2019s my motivation. I like being notorious, or whatever is the thing that pleases me is what you have to respond to, or that it\u2019s an interesting puzzle or a question. Like this book, I want to know about it. Soon people will know what it is. But I want to know about it, and that\u2019s why I want to do it because I\u2019m interested in it. With the TV show, I really want to figure out how to do a TV show. I know it sounds dumb but I love television and I\u2019ve always wanted to do something. We have this great relationship with NBC, and there are all kinds of opportunities. I\u2019m not going to get this opportunity too much. With a column, I don\u2019t know why; Trump. I\u2019m pissed about Trump. I am. I can\u2019t stand him. I\u2019m trying to channel it in a way that\u2019s not quite as hateful as I feel, as many people feel. Because you shouldn\u2019t react to idiots but there\u2019s something about him that\u2019s an \u201cer\u201d feeling about everything that you might dislike and retrograde people. So I try to channel it in a really effective, funny, interesting way. I know it sounds morbid but my dad died when he was 34 from a cerebral hemorrhage; just died pretty quickly. Tim Ferriss: So unexpected. Kara Swisher: Very, very. Three kids, thought he was on his way. He had just left the Navy. He was a poor guy. The Navy put him through medical school. He had just gotten a job as head of anesthesia at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. He had just bought a new house; everything was starting. He just died. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Kara Swisher: Super affected me, like you can\u2019t believe. It just creates a situation. There\u2019s this thing where people whose parents died when they were very young become highly functional. There\u2019s actually a Stanford professor who\u2019s written a lot about this. Nothing bothers you. Like war, pestilence, I don\u2019t care; I survived my parent\u2019s death. Because when you\u2019re that young and someone dies, it\u2019s like as if half the people you know died because they\u2019re the people you depended on. He was a wonderful parent; very attentive, very loving. Those are my memories, and they are true; they\u2019re actually accurate. So I think it\u2019s always made me think I\u2019m going to die young. You know what I mean? Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Kara Swisher: It just does. There\u2019s not that much complexity to it, logically speaking. So my brothers and I are all incredibly successful and very functional. We don\u2019t get bogged down a lot. After I turned 34, I felt better. Like once I passed that landmark. But where it really hit me is in two places. One was when my son was 5 and I realized how well he knew me. I don\u2019t remember a lot of my father. You remember little snatches and memories. I\u2019ve always wanted to get hypnotized to get better memories but I\u2019m not so sure that will even work. But he knew me incredibly well at 5. We were very close. We had conversations. So I must have had that and I don\u2019t remember it. But I remember being devastated at the time. Tim Ferriss: When you had that realization. Kara Swisher: That he knew me so well. I realized how devastated I was. Like oh, my God, look what I lost? So I lost that relationship, and it was more significant than I can recall. You can\u2019t remember, you just can\u2019t remember. There are only so many things you can remember. I don\u2019t remember last week. So I remember being very devastated for me, for me as a 5-year-old. And I never let myself feel that way when I was younger, for most of my life. So I really was like wow, that really did hurt me. It was a good realization to not think you\u2019re not weak, or you got hurt. Again, that\u2019s not something I had any control over. It wasn\u2019t a cruel parent, it wasn\u2019t abuse; it just was a bad thing that happened. The second thing is when I had a stroke, which was five years ago. I don\u2019t know if you know this. I had a stroke on my way to Hong Kong. I was going for a code, all things de-Asia. I was flying in coach and should have not been flying in coach. I didn\u2019t get up from my seat, I didn\u2019t drink water. I\u2019m like the ad for \u2013 Tim Ferriss: For the deep vein thrombosis. Kara Swisher: Yeah, exactly. As it turns out, I also had a hole in my heart, which 20 percent of the human race has, apparently; I was told. It\u2019s called a PFO. Interestingly enough, a lot of people still don\u2019t know they have them later told me they have them. And it\u2019s super common. But this was like a hole-in-one. And it also turns out from doing 23 and Me that I have \u2013 Ann Winjisky called me in Hong Kong after it happened and said you need to look at your report because you have this blood disorder that\u2019s also very common. It\u2019s called Mediterranean blood; it\u2019s thick blood, essentially. My family is Italian. So I had all these things I didn\u2019t know and they all conspired to have a stroke; I had a stroke. I was working, writing about Yahoo. Someone had left. I\u2019m like oh, this fucking place is like a disaster. And I said it out loud and it came out garbled, super garbled. I was like, oh, that\u2019s weird. I had suffered from migraines so I thought it was a migraine. I was tired, I had landed and I didn\u2019t go to sleep. So I kept typing, and then I went to eat a strawberry and it fell out of my mouth. And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s weird. Then I felt a tingling, and that was it. that was the entire range of symptoms. I couldn\u2019t speak, strawberry, finger. I couldn\u2019t call anyone to tell anyone about this. Because I was like, this is odd. I wasn\u2019t totally disturbed but I was like, this is unusual; perhaps it\u2019s just a bad headache. I wrote an email to my brother who\u2019s a doctor, who followed my father\u2019s footsteps. He was asleep because of the time difference. Then I went up to breakfast. I took a shower. I literally didn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m like the worst; I\u2019m like the ad for what not to do when you have a stroke. By the time I got to breakfast, I was speaking as if I had dental work. So it was coming back pretty quickly. I was like: oh, see, it\u2019s just a weird muscle thing. My brother called me and said \u201cYou need to get to a hospital; you\u2019re having a stroke.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, come on, you terrible doctor.\u201d I insulted him. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m young.\u201d I was in my 40s. He\u2019s like, \u201cPlease just do me a favor and go get an MRI; not a CAT scan. Tell them this. Please go right now.\u201d And I was like, alright. I went to the hospital and turns out I was having a stroke, which was amazing. It was sort of like I was outside of myself while I was having it. by the time I got to the hospital, I was talking like this. So I wasn\u2019t feeling bad, I wasn\u2019t tired. There was no anything.. Tim Ferriss: No symptoms. Kara Swisher: Nothing. But they did the MRI and it turned out I had had one, or had just finished one. I was fascinated by this. I shouldn\u2019t have been so fascinated but you could see the blood going around the clot. It was so cool, though. Your body just did it. Tim Ferriss: Cool and terrifying. Kara Swisher: Yeah, but your body fixed it. Your body found another \u2013 like you\u2019re in traffic. You\u2019re in traffic and you find another route. It found another route to get the blood through. I\u2019ll never forget. All the people in China, they have things over their faces all the time, in the hospitals they do which is disturbing; it\u2019s sort of weird. And the doctor said you had a stroke. It\u2019s the first time I got upset because I thought about my kids. I thought about my kids without me; this is going to be horrible for them. And I remembered how horrible it was for me, and I had a flash, like a trigger. I didn\u2019t get upset any other time during that process, and I started crying just then because I thought about my kids. It was quite emotional. And since then\u2026 I\u2019ve always been like this; it\u2019s tripled and quadrupled my determination to do whatever I wanted to do and keep going. Tim Ferriss: What would you like to be remembered for, if anything comes to mind? Kara Swisher: I think being forthright and honest. I think the reason I\u2019ve done really well is because people are so tired of pushing themselves down, in good ways and bad ways. And I think part of the Trump thing, I hate to say I\u2019m like Donald Trump of course because I think he lies all the time. So he does it and lies all the time. But I think he\u2019s sort of Id, right? Pure Id. There\u2019s no super ego stopping anything and it\u2019s just whatever the fuck comes to his mind he just says, sort of thing. I admire nothing about him but I do think that\u2019s fascinating, the ability to do that. So I\u2019d like to be remembered for someone who told the truth, or tried to tell the truth and tried to make people understand things a little better without all the useless frippery we go around doing. Do you know what I mean? Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Kara Swisher: I think that would be good. I\u2019d like to be known as a good parent. I think I am a good parent. It\u2019s funny because people are like oh, you shouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m like, why? I\u2019m a good parent. I have great kids. It\u2019s funny because people always want to insult their kids. It\u2019s weird. You know, you say how are your kids? I say, \u201cMy kids are great.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh.\u201d And I say, \u201cNo, they\u2019re remarkable kids. They\u2019re wonderful.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well everyone has problems.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s funny. So I think I\u2019m really pleased with my kids. And Megan\u2019s and my parenting; I\u2019m very proud of that. Like last night my son, Alex, called and he was crying over the Obama speech. He\u2019s 11. He was crying; he was really crying. He was like, \u201cI can\u2019t cry; I\u2019m a guy.\u201d I was so proud that he was crying. I know it sounds dumb because he was super upset. I didn\u2019t want him to be comforted. I want him to feel that feeling of being so disappointed about what\u2019s happened politically. And it was good for him. And I really loved that he felt like he could do that. That was one thing. And then my other son, Louie, who has a much easier time in life in general because he\u2019s like the happiest kid ever known. He was born happy; he remains happy. So far, knock on wood. He and I talked a lot and they live away from me right now because Megan is working for President Obama, and I go back and forth. I miss them a great deal. So we talked a lot over the holidays. He\u2019s 14 now, almost 15 so we really can have great conversations. Sometimes he says dumb things but we have great arguments and stuff like that, and I say dumb things. It just was really lovely to talk to him because I really enjoyed spending time with him. I don\u2019t think a lot of people enjoy spending time with their kids. I\u2019d rather be with him than other people because he\u2019s super interesting and has a great mind. I was sad about something and I hadn\u2019t said anything to him. I don\u2019t involve him in everything. Like some people tell their kids too much stuff. And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s been really nice talking to you. I\u2019ve been a little sad but now I feel better.\u201d And all he said was, \u201cI know.\u201d What a great kid, right? I was very moved by it because I felt like he was so mature that he didn\u2019t have to over talk it; he just\u2026 Tim Ferriss: I know. Kara Swisher: It was great. That was all he said and I was so proud of me, and him for getting to be a really smart young man, and he really is. Tim Ferriss: What are the keys to good parenting for you? Kara Swisher: It\u2019s hard because you\u2019d be surprised but Megan and I are not very hard on them on school. I find the obsession with school and achievement to be disturbing. We do not push that. Megan more than I, but I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know that. You don\u2019t need to know that.\u201d I\u2019m always like, \u201cThis is useless; don\u2019t even bother. Go for a walk.\u201d I want them to go outside more. The obsession with making your life better through your children I think is really demented, and you see it all over the place. Tim Ferriss: Vicarious living through your kids. Kara Swisher: More than that; the achievement. Pushing them when you know full well it doesn\u2019t matter. Like most of my schooling doesn\u2019t matter; like seriously doesn\u2019t matter. I had an argument with one of his teachers recently. They were doing some homework assignment, and I was like, \u201cThis is stupid.\u201d And they were like, \u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, it is. Trust me. It\u2019s stupid. You don\u2019t need it. And by the way, I\u2019m more successful than you and I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s stupid.\u201d So it was really interesting. And I tell that to them. And one of the things, it does manifest itself. My youngest son is quite brilliant. He\u2019s a builder, a mentor. He\u2019s got some special skills that are really quite amazing. And my other son is very smart, but not at school. School, he just gets bored by school. But he\u2019ll do great; he\u2019ll probably be the president. He\u2019s that kind of person. He can go from A to D in two seconds and it\u2019s fascinating. Because he could do it if he wanted to. And so I should be one of those parents who\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try harder to get that A.\u201d I hate this about him but I love it. because so many of his friends are so tightly wound, like so tightly wound at a young age. And you\u2019re sort of like don\u2019t do that. You have plenty of time to be tightly wound. He got a D in math or something like that. And he\u2019s pretty good; he could get an A, or maybe a B. He definitely could get a B. He gets a D and I go, \u201cLouie, a D?\u201d And he goes, \u201cEh, at least it\u2019s not an F.\u201d I loved him for that answer. It\u2019s horrible! He goes, at least it\u2019s not an F. And I go, \u201cIt is an F. A D is an F. Just so you know, they don\u2019t give Fs anymore. They give you a D and that\u2019s an F.\u201d And he goes eh\u2026 And I can\u2019t compliment him for that response but I love it. I was like, good for him. Like fuck you. You know what I mean? And I know he\u2019ll be fine so I feel like I just don\u2019t want to get them all\u2026 Like so many kids, and the parents are tightly wound. Tim Ferriss: The kids are living like adults by the time they\u2019re 10 years old. Kara Swisher: I\u2019d rather them be here. Right, exactly. You know, he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t go to college?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cEh, whatever.\u201d People are surprised because I\u2019m so ambitious and so hardworking but I just feel like I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019m doing; that\u2019s why I\u2019m ambitious, not for achievement. They\u2019re in an East Coast school which is very tightly wound. The East Coast people are just \u2013 I grew up on the East Coast and I forgot. I forgot. Tim Ferriss: Oh, me too. Kara Swisher: And they\u2019re all \u2013 like Mosh and they\u2019re all lawyers. They\u2019re clearly in unhappy marriages; you can see it. You\u2019re like oh, you\u2019ve really never had sex in years. I\u2019m thinking that in my head and I kind of want to say it out loud. We were talking about something about the internet, and I just was like, that is not true. It\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s not the tools, it\u2019s you. It\u2019s you and your kids. They get over\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s funny. I\u2019ll tell this last story. He\u2019s on Snapchat all the time. The youngest one is not on this stuff right now; he\u2019s not involved in a lot of this stuff. He\u2019s not interested. My older son is on Snapchat a lot, he does a lot of videos. He likes it, obviously, like a lot of teens; it\u2019s very typical. They had this Instagram account where they post memes with each other, and they joke. And he did one that one kid got really upset about. And when does a joke not become a joke? Well, it wasn\u2019t. And so there was a hubbub at school, and that\u2019s one issue I\u2019m very particular on is how he presents himself about women, about people of color; all kinds of stuff like that. And it\u2019s not PC, it\u2019s just he\u2019s a white guy in America; he could be a little nicer. That\u2019s my whole thing. And he\u2019s lucky. He\u2019s rich, he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s tall, he\u2019s handsome; he could be nicer. He really needs to be, and kinder. So he had done it and I made him call the parents of the person. I made him talk to the kid and stuff like that. The school called, and he didn\u2019t mean it in a malevolent way; he didn\u2019t. Like I wasn\u2019t trying to say you\u2019re an asshole. But I didn\u2019t want him not to feel like he was wrong. So the school was like, \u201cWell you know, we don\u2019t want to be punitive here.\u201d And I go, \u201cNo, I want to be punitive. I want him to feel the consequence.\u201d I spend a lot of time talking about consequences with him because he\u2019s a teen. The 11-year-old, it doesn\u2019t matter as much. But I want him to feel consequences of his actions, always so that he understands the price of things and when you do something, I want him to understand that. That\u2019s one of the things I think parents don\u2019t do nearly enough. Tim Ferriss: Definitely. Kara Swisher: But they\u2019re great kids. They\u2019re great kids. They\u2019re fantastic. And I don\u2019t want them also to feel that they\u2019re special. In California, it\u2019s the opposite problem; everybody\u2019s special. You don\u2019t have children but it\u2019s\u2026 Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t, but I\u2019ve seen it. Kara Swisher: You\u2019ve seen it. Like awards for everything and stuff like that. So I was in a meeting. I\u2019m very grammatically accurate. I love grammar. I was in a meeting and one of the parents, or the teachers, was like, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re all special.\u201d They said that, that thing. And I put my hand up, and I go, \u201cPoint of fact, if we\u2019re all special, no one\u2019s special.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a word that means different\u2026 Tim Ferriss: They\u2019re like who let this lady in here again? Kara Swisher: I know, exactly. They were like, excuse me? I go, \u201cIf everybody\u2019s special, nobody is. Just so you know, the word special, it\u2019s like unique. There\u2019s no such thing as very unique.\u201d When people do \u201cvery unique,\u201d it drives me crazy. I hate when people modify \u201cunique.\u201d So they were like \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re all special in different ways.\u201d I go, \u201cNo, no, no. We\u2019re not. We all know the rules and the status symbols. We all know it\u2019s either money or a job or fascinating, or beautifully creative.\u201d I said, \u201cEverybody isn\u2019t special. And if we teach kids that everyone\u2019s special, they\u2019ll think they\u2019re special when they\u2019re not.\u201d Like, there are special things, like they\u2019re the best little baker or whatever but let\u2019s set the parameters. But what you\u2019re talking about is achievement, and wealth and whatever you are. Let\u2019s assume that. Once we set the rules, we can say who is special but we can rank people, we can. You do it every day of your life. Why are you pretending to these kids that we\u2019re not ranking all day long? And of course this is San Francisco; their minds were like bah. I said language matters; it matters what you say. And I don\u2019t know why I said this but I am successful; so is Megan. Megan worked at Google and [inaudible] of America. I go, \u201cWe\u2019re more special than everyone else here in jobs, probably; a lot of people here. Let\u2019s be honest! \u201cLike come on. If you had a gun to your head and you had to rank people here, come on. And I was like that might be jobs, or it might be money. This person over here is fucking rich as hell. They win on that one.\u201d The headmaster, who I am in good friends with, was like, \u201cOh, Kara.\u201d And I was like let\u2019s define our terms if we\u2019re going to use that word so carelessly. Tim Ferriss: I want to switch gears a little bit, and I\u2019ll run through what I call rapid fire questions. They don\u2019t need rapid fire answers. Kara Swisher: Oh, I like rapid fire questions. Tim Ferriss: If you had to give a TED Talk on something you\u2019re not known for at all\u2026 Kara Swisher: I gave one on my stroke. I gave one of those TED\u2026 Tim Ferriss: If you had to give another one, but on something you are not known for, what would you give it on? Kara Swisher: My obsession with television. I love TV shows, like bad television. Tim Ferriss: Bad television. What\u2019s your favorite bad TV show? Kara Swisher: Anything with Heather Locklear. I love her. Tim Ferriss: Wow, I haven\u2019t thought of Heather. Kara Swisher: She\u2019s the best. I did an interview with her once. I was so happy. One of my greatest moments of my life. Anything with Heather. I like bad TV. Bad TV actresses. They always insult her, and they\u2019re like oh, she\u2019s terrible. I\u2019m like no, she\u2019s brilliant at bad acting; or that kind of acting, that genre. Tim Ferriss: She\u2019s the master; the Michelangelo of bad acting. Kara Swisher: Not bad acting as bad acting, like I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just bad, like the dramatic lines. I even love \u2013 it sounds stupid \u2013 Viola Davis, who\u2019s a really good actress; she\u2019s going to win the Oscar for Fences. But she\u2019s in that show, How to Get Away with Murder, which I love. It\u2019s a terrible, horrible show; it\u2019s Shonda Rhimes at her very best. She had a line. Her husband was sleeping with a coed. \u201cHow did your penis get in that white girl\u2019s mouth?\u201d And she read that like she was Lawrence fucking Olivier. How did your penis get\u2026 and I was like oh, that was brilliant! I was happy for days at that. And I was like, she fucking ate that up. She took that line and she went with it. Like who wrote that line? And she didn\u2019t even\u2026 Tim Ferriss: Didn\u2019t even flinch. Kara Swisher: She did that line reading like you can\u2019t believe, and I thought I love you, Viola Davis. You can act up a fucking storm over here but over here, you\u2019re taking that, you\u2019re biting it, you\u2019re going for it and I love that mentality of hers. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve met a lot of people; many, many, many, hundreds probably at this point certainly, that are held up on a pedestal as successful. When you hear the word \u201csuccessful,\u201d who comes to mind and why? Kara Swisher: Among tech people, or\u2026? Tim Ferriss: No, any across the board. Kara Swisher: That\u2019s a good question. Again, it\u2019s how you define the term, right? Tim Ferriss: Yep, that\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving it open so I\u2019d like to hear how you define it. Kara Swisher: I really thought Steve Jobs was great, I just do. He was who he was. I like someone who\u2019s like that. So I thought he was successful at being the person he was and dealing with the issues he had going forward. He could have been nicer, I guess; I don\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t married to him. Although, he seemed to have good relations with his kids. I don\u2019t know. Of the people I\u2019ve met, I like Pierre Omidyar. I think he\u2019s a lovely guy. I think he\u2019s been very successful, and he\u2019s kind. I tend to like the kinder people. I think he\u2019s true to himself. He\u2019s kind of quirky and unusual, and has unusual taste. Things he invests in, it\u2019s all do-gooder. And I\u2019m not a do-gooder, trust me but I like that about him. I do like Cheryl Sandberg. We get along very well. Some of the stuff I tweak her all out about lean in. I always say I lean in and fall over; it\u2019s a big joke I have with her. I think she\u2019s true to herself, again. Tim Ferriss: That seems to be the common thread. Kara Swisher: Yeah, true to themselves. I do like Mark Zuckerberg a lot. I didn\u2019t when I first met him. I didn\u2019t not like him. When I first met him, I didn\u2019t want to go down there. It was 2000; early, early. And Owen van Natta, who was the president of Facebook at the time \u2013 this was a million years ago and nothing was successful. It wasn\u2019t public; it wasn\u2019t doing well. It was doing okay. It wasn\u2019t an upward trajectory the whole time. He came in the room and I said I don\u2019t want to meet him; I heard he\u2019s an asshole. Like oh, do I want to meet another little shitty little startup white dude? Like ugh, kind of thing. He walked in the room and he goes, \u201cI heard you think I\u2019m an asshole,\u201d which I liked that he did that. Tim Ferriss: I was going to say, I knew you were going to like that. Kara Swisher: I liked it. And I go, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know you well enough. You might very well be an asshole but I really should get to know you before I call you an asshole.\u201d And it was great. We had a great talk. And I like him because he learns; he seems to learn. I don\u2019t like everything he says, like this last thing about fake news, I thought he was being inane. And he\u2019s said a lot of inane stuff. But I like that he seems to learn. I like people who learn and improve. Tim Ferriss: Very focused on learning. Kara Swisher: He is. It\u2019s very earnest but I kind of like it. Who else do I like that I wasn\u2019t expecting? There was someone the other day where I walked in the room and he was wearing khakis in a way that I hate, you know what I mean? The golf man khakis and a golf guy shirt. I\u2019m like oh, this guy. Tim Ferriss: I have an allergy to those, too after Princeton. Kara Swisher: But here what I was doing was okay, he looks like a person I wouldn\u2019t like. And we had the best time. I\u2019m blanking on who it was. I was just sort of like oh, like this guy; he\u2019s fantastic. I wasn\u2019t expecting to have such a great mind. So I was surprised, and I kind of was like oh, Kara, don\u2019t be so easily judgy. I\u2019m trying to think of who else I like. I like a lot of people. I like more people than you think. Tim Ferriss: I don\u2019t necessarily think you dislike people. Kara Swisher: Yeah, I like a lot of people. I like the guy at the corner store, Sammy. He\u2019s fantastic. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ll ask the billboard question, because I like this question. If you had a huge billboard and you could patent a short message on it, or an image to get it out to millions of people, what would you put on it? Kara Swisher: Stop. Tim Ferriss: Stop. And for you, what does that mean? Kara Swisher: One of my favorite books I read a lot, one of the ones that had the most effect on me\u2026 I took a course freshman year at Georgetown, which I didn\u2019t love Georgetown. I\u2019m Catholic but I grew up in a very progressive school. So I got there and there were all these kids from Catholic school that just went wild, so they drank too much and vomited, and date rape everywhere, and so sexist and so horrible and anti gay. So it was not a great time to be a Georgetown. And I was in a course called Problem of God. Tim Ferriss: Problem of God. Kara Swisher: Right, it\u2019s a great title. It was an existentialism \u2013 it was taught by a Jesuit. Jesuits are amazing teachers. When you get a great one, Jesuits are amazing teachers. And it was perfect. I was 17, I think when I went to college; I was a little younger. It was a mind blowing course because I read Sartre, Kamu, Kafka, Dag Hammarskjold, which I\u2019m not a religious person but it really had an impact on me. He was seen as a technocrat; it turned out he was quite religious. Markings, I think was his book. It was just so mind blowing. I had never thought of these issues and it really impacted me. I\u2019ll never forget, the first day of the course, the guy\u2019s name was Father Chiafi. I\u2019ll never forget him. He goes, \u201cIs it God\u2019s problem with man, or man\u2019s problem with God?\u201d I was like whoa. It\u2019s true; like what is it? Probably man\u2019s problem with God is more the thing. So we read all these texts, and we read The Trial, one of my favorite books. I read it again and again. That\u2019s another book I read again and again. The first line of the book, The Trial, I\u2019m not saying it right: someone must have been telling lies about Joseph K because he was arrested one fine morning.\u201d It\u2019s something like that. That\u2019s the first line. Everybody thinks it\u2019s about totalitarian states but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not about Russia, it\u2019s not about China, it\u2019s not about communism. It\u2019s about stopping in your life. It\u2019s about stopping, like being stopped; being arrested. The word \u201carrested\u201d is not arrested here; it\u2019s being stopped and considering what you\u2019re doing. This is a man who would not stop and consider what he was doing. And the last line, you do get it. He taught it so well. When someone teaches you a text really well, or shows you a painting that you didn\u2019t understand and then opens it up to you; I think that\u2019s what I do with writing sometimes. I make people think differently. Like oh, wait a minute; I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Maybe that\u2019s the truth. And so this guy taught so well. The last part of the book he\u2019s supposedly about to be executed but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s about to go to the execution, because he\u2019s not getting it. God is trying to get through to him but God can\u2019t impose himself on Joseph K. But he won\u2019t hear God. You know what I mean? So it was a lot about that. And the last part of the book, someone throws a window \u2013 as he\u2019s going to the gallows or wherever he\u2019s supposedly getting killed, someone throws up in the window and puts their arms out, and it\u2019s God saying \u201cStop, just stop for a fucking second.\u201d And nobody does that. And so I\u2019d say stop. Do you know what I mean? Tim Ferriss: I totally know. Kara Swisher: Like nobody \u2013 just a second. Just stop. Like what you\u2019re talking about, meditate in the morning; just stop. Tim Ferriss: What\u2019s the rush? Kara Swisher: Not just what\u2019s the rush; there is a rush. Tim Ferriss: Well, there is a rush but there\u2019s\u2026 not to interject but I have the mental moray all over my house so I\u2019m constantly reminded of death, all over my house. Kara Swisher: Yeah. Oh, that\u2019s important. Tim Ferriss: So I recognize the value of time, but I recognize how, when I rush or when I feel rushed, I\u2019m not present. I\u2019m constantly stuck somewhere else. Kara Swisher: I think it\u2019s the same thing with stop, no. No. Everyone, say yes. No. No, no, no. No, no, no. And the best part \u2013 there\u2019s a great line from Shakespeare; I think it\u2019s Henry V, maybe? \u201cI waste time, and now doth time waste me.\u201d I\u2019ve always loved that quote. Tim Ferriss: That is a good line. Kara Swisher: That\u2019s a great line. It\u2019s a great line. Tim Ferriss: Do you have a favorite failure, meaning a failure, something that didn\u2019t go the way you hoped that set you up for later success in some way? Kara Swisher: I think a lot of relationships. I wish I could go back. Again, that\u2019s why I liked La La Land. It was really interesting. It\u2019s all about mistakes that we make with each other. In work, no; I think I\u2019ve been very\u2026 I haven\u2019t asked questions that I wanted; I maybe didn\u2019t move fast enough. Tim Ferriss: You\u2019ve charted the path well. Kara Swisher: I was thinking the other day, someone was talking about their career and I\u2019m like, I\u2019ve timed my career beautifully. It\u2019s nowhere but up now, and then I just leave. I was thinking about all the interviews I\u2019ve done with all the different people over the years, like over 10, 15 years. I could leave right now. That\u2019s how I feel. Like wow, I\u2019ve done a lot. My body of work is excellent. I\u2019m leaving behind all these amazing interviews with the greatest minds of our day. Like I interviewed whoever was Edison, I did that. Whoever was Tesla, whoever was Lincoln, I did it, that moment. So I feel good on the work stuff. There\u2019s some stuff I want to do and try, and I think I could get to another plane. Probably I haven\u2019t tried very hard in relationships as I should. I haven\u2019t been as smart as I should have been, as I am at work. I guess in failure, I don\u2019t know. Because when I wanted to leave the Post, I left. I always leave when I should leave. I\u2019m good at leaving; realizing I\u2019m not going anywhere and stopping. So I\u2019m good at that. I think I probably \u2013 no, I didn\u2019t stay at that; I left. Tim Ferriss: Well, you\u2019re good at stopping. Kara Swisher: I\u2019m good at stopping, looking around and saying no, not this anymore; no more of this. And that\u2019s in a career sense. I\u2019m good in that way with my kid, so I\u2019ve been I think a great parent. I think probably I don\u2019t leave quickly enough in relationships, and I think I\u2019m getting really good at that. I just recently got separated from Megan, who I love; we have a great family. But I think I did that well. We did that. It was a good thing; it\u2019s good for both of us and we are much happier because of it. And I feel good. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve gone: huh, this has to change. And it had to go with my stroke, too. Tim Ferriss: When you stop and leave, say, the Post or a given publication company or a relationship, is there a way you frame it to the other side when you have that conversation? Kara Swisher: Yes. The relationship was interesting. I\u2019m sure Megan doesn\u2019t mind me talking about it but I was fascinated by the reaction of people because they liked us as a couple. We love each other, by the way. Again, we are the best not married couple ever. We\u2019re happier than most married people. We don\u2019t even have lawyers. But they\u2019re like, why are you divorcing? You get along so well. I\u2019m like well, just because we have other things to do. So I think what was interesting, not so much Megan because Megan\u2019s really wonderful and kind and good, was reaction. What I did bothered people. I remember watching reactions to people, and a lot of them it\u2019s like you can\u2019t do that. No, you\u2019re great together. I\u2019m like, how do you know? First of all, how do you know? Like I was talking about social media before; how do you know what\u2019s really going on here And there was nothing awful going on, but it\u2019s like how do you know? Then I realized oh, it\u2019s about them. They\u2019re vaguely unhappy and I\u2019ve actually done something about it. And I said I\u2019m not happy. I said I\u2019m not unhappy, I\u2019m just not happy and I want to be happy. That\u2019s what I want. And so it really bothered a lot of people. And a lot of it was like, you\u2019ve invested all this time. And I said it\u2019s not an investment. Marriage isn\u2019t an investment that you lose it if you stop it. we have wonderful children, we\u2019ve had wonderful times. We still like each other. We\u2019re not mean to each other. It\u2019s not an investment, it\u2019s just done. It\u2019s done. It\u2019s done and it\u2019s not done in a cruel way, it\u2019s not done in any way. It\u2019s not perfect because it\u2019s leaving. A lot of them liked us as a couple because we were a famous lesbian couple; they love that, like iconic and I get that. We were always on the power lists and stuff, which I hate. They have one lesbian couple they have to find and now they don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s true, though. Tim Ferriss: I get it. Kara Swisher: You know what I mean? Someone\u2019s like oh, you\u2019re on a power\u2026 I\u2019m like I know I\u2019m a power couple. We\u2019re always on it. We\u2019re it. It\u2019s like sometimes Megan and I get lesbian awards. I\u2019m like, we\u2019re it; they\u2019ve run out of people to give awards to. A friend of mine called me and I told them, and so they were like \u2013 and I\u2019ve never forgotten this. They were like, \u201cHow many percentage unhappy were you?\u201d How many percentage? I\u2019m like, what? I hadn\u2019t even thought about it in a numerical way. And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201c50 percent? 40 percent were you unhappy? Were you 60 percent unhappy? What\u2019s the percentage?\u201d And I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t answer that. I guess 60, 70, I don\u2019t know.\u201d It was like weird to try to quantify it. And I wasn\u2019t really that unhappy; it\u2019s just I wasn\u2019t where I wanted to be. I hung up the phone and called another friend. I\u2019m like, she\u2019s getting divorced. Like, I knew it. That was good because she started to reflect. Otherwise, people get disturbed by it because then they have to compare it to their own experience and what they\u2019re willing to tolerate. I wasn\u2019t apologetic about it. Neither Megan nor I were apologetic for it. We didn\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. There was no drama. There was no anger. We were great to the kids. We talked to the kids. It was bothersome. It was fascinating to watch. It was really interesting because people do tolerate being just okay happy. And I don\u2019t want to be. Tim Ferriss: So on that note, and this will be probably the last question; maybe the second to the last. If you reflect back on one of the toughest periods in your life, one of the darker periods, if you can place us when and where that is, and what advice would you give that person? Kara Swisher: Gosh, that\u2019s a good question. I haven\u2019t had that many dark periods. Tim Ferriss: Or just difficult. Kara Swisher: It\u2019s always been around relationships; breaking up. I\u2019ve gotten broken up just as many times as I\u2019ve broken up with people. One thing I do do in relationships that I don\u2019t do in life, I\u2019m very good at cutting things loose. I\u2019m not good at that. I\u2019m not good about leaving the relationship. I always hope for better, like I can fix it. That\u2019s my problem. If they only understood my fantastic argument. There\u2019s a really good Cheryl Strade quote about \u201cyou can\u2019t make people love you.\u201d You can\u2019t. But I think of course you can. Now when I look back on it, it\u2019s like the same thing with school. That didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure it got me somewhere else but I can\u2019t even recall that emotion when I think back on that. You know what, one thing that really made me sad and I shouldn\u2019t have done this, maybe I should have. I probably should have. I still wonder if I should have. I went out with someone. We were very much in love and we broke up anyway because we wanted different things. You just have to know that if you\u2019re with anybody. She didn\u2019t want kids; I wanted kids. I wanted to live a loud life; she wanted a quiet life. We were too different but we really loved each other. Some people just spark, and stuff like that. But really just not for the long term. And it was devastating to me because you found someone you connect with; it\u2019s hard in life. And I couldn\u2019t be around her. It was relatively mutual and I always kept trying to come up with solutions, like an idiot. Oh, if we only\u2026 how do you get beyond I don\u2019t want kids? You don\u2019t. But I kept saying if only\u2026 And I would have had to give up kids, which I would never have wanted to do. I kept trying to figure it, trying to figure it and figure it and sometimes you just have to drop something. You just have to say it\u2019s not fixable. And so I didn\u2019t speak to this person at all; I just couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to be friends. I have lots of friends. We weren\u2019t friends. And so what was really interesting is I didn\u2019t contact her for years and years. I had kids afterwards. Time passed. I remember at the time, I just didn\u2019t want to talk to her. I just didn\u2019t. I knew that I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think she wanted to talk to me. And then I just let time go, and I wasn\u2019t mad anymore. And I didn\u2019t call her. I wrote an email. I was thinking about it. I was with a bunch of friends and I started to write an email to her: we should talk, finally. We really love each other; we loved each other. And so I would like to see you; I\u2019d love to catch up on your life. I wrote the email and I started it because I was with some friends that reminded me of her. And I wanted her to meet my kids. I was like oh, it\u2019s time. It\u2019s time. And I didn\u2019t finish it. Days later I was getting on a plane and I get a call. I was with Walt Mossberg at the time, and she had drowned. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Kara Swisher: It was shocking. In her basement. It was this weird \u2013 she did books on [inaudible] for a living. She was going down to collect some of her recording equipment. She\u2019s a wonderful, beautiful actress and beautiful reader. She had gotten caught \u2013 it was a terrible death. I\u2019m not going to go into it in detail but she drowned in her own house. It was through a flood, and it was just like so fucking random. It was weird and random. It wasn\u2019t like a car accident or something like that cancer. It was just like random as shit. Like God just said you\u2019re gonna die today. I was just\u2026 I literally had an email sitting there waiting to send, and I didn\u2019t. I think I felt sicker than I\u2019ve ever felt that I didn\u2019t send it. not that I would have seen her, necessarily. As you know, I\u2019m into time travel and change of time. I love that Ray Bradbury story, the one where he goes back and steps on the butterfly and suddenly we have Nazis kind of thing; you know in the future. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Kara Swisher: And so I was like what if I had written and gone to see her? Could I have stopped\u2026 because I\u2019m such an ego maniac. But I still was thinking of why didn\u2019t I do that? So I\u2019m super interested in paths not taken. Like if you don\u2019t turn left\u2026 Today if I go out here and I take a right instead of a left, what happens? I\u2019m very interested in that kind of stuff. That\u2019s another surprising thing; I\u2019m super interested in that concept. What was that movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. It was not a great movie. Subway doors or something like that. She takes two different moves and it changes everything, and they show you both of them. So anyway, I felt \u2013 not because I didn\u2019t write her but I remember thinking, I should have done that. I felt terrible for a long time. I still feel terrible. At the same time, it was the right thing not to contact. It was just a weird thing. Tim Ferriss: Reflective about it. Kara Swisher: Very. I was surprisingly upset about it. I thought about it a lot, why I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion now that it was the right thing not to be in touch but part of me wishes I had sent that email and gone up to visit and said hello, because you just didn\u2019t know. Like, the same thing with my dad; you just didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. Tim Ferriss: So in a world where so much is hard to predict or impossible to predict, and with so much cynicism out there, how do you remain hopeful? Kara Swisher: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m hopeful. Tim Ferriss: Or optimistic. Kara Swisher: You know I have all these little rules. I think there are optimistic pessimists, which I think I am. There are pessimistic optimists, which I am not. There are optimistic optimists; that\u2019s Megan, for example. And then there are pessimistic pessimists. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m hopeful at all. Tim Ferriss: What is an optimistic pessimist? Kara Swisher: The world will be blowing up at some point and none of it matters. Like, it\u2019s meaningless. I\u2019m not religious so that\u2019s harder; I wish I was religious. I think all of us do, a little bit. A little religion has brought more pain and suffering to this planet than almost anything, right? I mean organized religion. And so I really do believe the sun is going to blow up and it\u2019s all going to melt. And worrying about recycling, or the elephants, or Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to matter one bit someday, just one day. Tim Ferriss: Where does the optimism fit in, then? Kara Swisher: You should live every day like that. I\u2019m with the Steve Jobs school. That speech really impacted me. I listen to that speech a lot. Tim Ferriss: The Stanford commencement? I have that in my calendar to watch every Sunday. Kara Swisher: Every Sunday? Every week? Wow. It\u2019s true. That is the most beautiful piece of writing. I love that speech and the way he delivered it. That\u2019s why I like Steve Jobs. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s fake; it was fan fucking fantastic. It\u2019s not fake. It wasn\u2019t fake. He knows. And the thing is, he created some of the most creative things in the years he was dying, not the other years; the years he was dying is when the great stuff happened. So his being cognizant of that was really important. And the other one, people will be surprised to know but I\u2019m very patriotic. Every time a flag comes out, I\u2019m like oh, U S of A, even though a lot of it\u2019s a lie. We\u2019ve done horrible things in the name of our flag. I love the Gettysburg Address. I go to Lincoln Memorial all the time when I\u2019m in DC and I go read it again and again, and it\u2019s one of my favorites. It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s 800 words. Actually in my bag right now, I have a copy of it. Tim Ferriss: The Gettysburg Address? Kara Swisher: Yes, and all the rewrites of it. I love it. It\u2019s so heartfelt about how people aren\u2019t going to remember \u2013 of course everybody remembered it but the sacrifices these people made. Any kind of military cemetery I go crazy in. There\u2019s one up in San Francisco that\u2019s amazing. It has an amazing quote from Auden, I think ? Tim Ferriss: W.H. Auden? Kara Swisher: It might be Auden. I don\u2019t think it is, actually. It\u2019s up above the Presidio. There\u2019s a little area there with these amazing quotes about young men dying and stuff like that. So I find sacrifice really profoundly moving, the stuff like that. There\u2019s a line in the Gettysburg Address. Let me get it. I have it right here. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kara Swisher: I carry it with me, which is interesting. See, look. Tim Ferriss: Wow, there it is. Kara Swisher: I carry the 14th Amendment; equal rights under the law because of gay things. So when anyone argues with me about gay rights, I\u2019m like hello, it\u2019s in the Constitution: equal rights under the law. But this is all about the history of it, and newspaper accounts; I just found this. There are four different copies. Where\u2019s the original copy? I like the whole thing. It\u2019s so short. It\u2019s like 800 words or something. It\u2019s like the most beautiful\u2026 where is it? Tim Ferriss: Take your time. I\u2019m not in any rush. Kara Swisher: I will. I made my sons memorize it, by the way. I did. Tim Ferriss: The Gettysburg Address. Kara Swisher: Yeah. It\u2019s the whole thing. Not that the world will long remember. When he goes, \u201cLiving and dead have struggled and consecrated far above the poor power to add or detract. The world will then long remember.\u201d People remember that part. This is the line I love. I love the whole thing. \u201cIt is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion that the cause for which they gave their last full measure of devotion.\u201d It\u2019s death, right? \u201cThat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation under God have the new birth of freedom, the government of the people.\u201d The last part I know got to be the famous part but it\u2019s this last level of devotion, and that honoring that for some reason it just moves me, this piece of writing. And then you know that he\u2019s going to die. You know what I mean? Like, what a narrative. You know what\u2019s going to happen to him. And that he was able to pull this out and talk about something well beyond himself I thought was just\u2026 given all this carnage was really quite beautiful. This is my favorite thing. Tim Ferriss: Kara, I think that\u2019s a great place to put a button in it. Everybody should get a copy. Kara Swisher: They should. It\u2019s a great speech. And you can memorize it. Tim Ferriss: You can memorize. Kara Swisher: Did you ever see the Ken Burns documentary about this? Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t. Kara Swisher: He gets autistic kids to memorize this passage. I don\u2019t love everything Ken Burns has done because it can take forever, and the twakety-twank confederacy music gets to me after a while. But he did a thing about autistic \u2013 people with learning disabilities learning to memorize this. And it was great. It was so moving. It was beautiful. It was great because they got it. Tim Ferriss: Well, Kara this has been so much fun. Kara Swisher: Good. Tim Ferriss: I really appreciate you taking the time. Kara Swisher: Thank you. It\u2019s been fun. Tim Ferriss: Where can people find everything more about you, say hello on the internet? Kara Swisher: Yes, @karaswisher. If you don\u2019t like insults of Trump, please don\u2019t tune in. I and the Trump can sort of yell at each other pretty much 24/7 at this point. They don\u2019t get that I\u2019m enjoying tweaking them in there. If I call them sore winners, they go crazy. They\u2019re fucking sore winners. And they think I\u2019m one of these liberals. Liberals just really have to stop and start to really tweak. You know, they get all offended by things. I\u2019m never offended by things he says. I\u2019m like, what a fucking douche. You know, getting all oh, can you believe it? That\u2019s why I operate with writing. Can you believe this person did this? I\u2019m like yeah, I can believe it. Yes, people have done horrible things to each other. If you\u2019re a student of history, you should believe it, kind of thing. And so I like to get into it with Trump people because they bite every time. They\u2019re so\u2026 not stupid; yeah, a lot of them are. but they just bite every\u2026 like it\u2019s so easy. It\u2019s enjoyable and easy and they\u2019re such dumbkins. Tim Ferriss: If people want to watch your [inaudible] \u2013 Kara Swisher: @karaswisher. I think you can write me at Kara@recode.net. And recode.net is our site. I write weekly columns. And then the podcast, Recode, Decode which that\u2019s the most enjoyable thing I\u2019ve been doing lately, as you know. Are you having a good time with yours? Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m having a great time. I love it. Kara Swisher: Podcasts are great. They\u2019re fun. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s so much fun. You can get past the sound bites and really dig in. Kara Swisher: Absolutely. We had James Cordan on recently; he wouldn\u2019t leave. I was like, you have to go. And he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m having a good time.\u201d Because you get interviewed by dumb Hollywood reporters all the time: so, what suit are you wearing? Anyway. Tim Ferriss: Well, I will let you get back to your day. This has been great. And for everybody listening, for links to the Gettysburg Address and documentaries; everything that we talked about in the show, as well as how you can reach Kara, you can tune into the show notes. They can be found with the show notes of every episode at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. And until next time, thank you for listening.
