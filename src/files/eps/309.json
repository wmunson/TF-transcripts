This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is typically my job to deconstruct world-class performers across all different industries and areas of expertise. This episode is going to be short and sweet instead of my long-form interviews, which range from one to four hours \u2013\u00a0that\u2019s long. If you want those, you can find 300-plus at Tim.blog/podcast, but this particular episode is going to be a short one. It will be roughly ten minutes in length, and it explains how to ten-x your thinking and your goals or, put another way, how to escape incremental thinking and think truly big \u2013\u00a0that\u2019s capital B-I-G. And I love this audio so much that I now listen to it on a regular basis as a reminder. And even if you only listen repeatedly to the first minute or so \u2013\u00a0the exercise that is described \u2013\u00a0it can be tremendously powerful. So, perhaps you\u2019ll end up doing the same thing and listening to it every Monday or once every month or whatever. The speaker is Dr. Astro Teller, @astroteller on Twitter. Astro is currently \u201cCaptain of Moonshots\u201d \u2013yes, that\u2019s his title \u2013 but you can think of him as CEO of X, formerly known as Google X, but now Alphabet\u2019s moonshot factory for building magical, audacious ideas that, through science and technology can be brought to reality. Astro\u2019s also cofounder and current director of Cerebellum Capital, a hedge fund management firm whose investments are continuously designed, executed, and improved by a software system based on techniques from statistical machine learning. He was also the cofounder and CEO of BodyMedia, Inc., a leading wearable body monitoring company that was sold to Jawbone in 2013. And Dr. Teller \u2013 Astro, as I call him \u2013\u00a0holds a bachelor of science in computer science from Stanford, masters of science in symbolic and heuristic computation, also from Stanford University \u2013\u00a0not only would I not qualify to study such a thing, I can barely pronounce it \u2013\u00a0and a PhD in artificial intelligence from Carnegie-Mellon University, where he was a recipient of the prestigious Hertz fellowship. The audio that you\u2019re going to hear was recorded as part of A360 \u2013\u00a0that\u2019s the letter A-3-6-0 \u2013\u00a0a high-end membership group run by past podcast guest, and founder and chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, Peter Diamandis, a very impressive guy in his own right. For more on A360 \u2013\u00a0if you want to know how this group comes together, what it involves, and its digital cousin, or version, you could think of it \u2013\u00a0Abundance Digital, since A360 is in person and Abundance Digital is, as you would guess, digital, please check out Diamandis.com. That\u2019s D-I-A-M-A-N-D-I-S.com and look under \u201cMemberships.\u201d So, without further ado, please enjoy Astro Teller, CEO of X, on how to think ten times bigger. Male Speaker:\u00a0Astro Teller, please come on up. Love this man. Astro Teller:\u00a0All right. You guys having fun? Various:\u00a0Mm-hmm. Astro Teller:\u00a0Awesome. So, I run an experiment very frequently \u2013\u00a0I\u2019ve done it before in this room \u2013\u00a0and typically it\u2019s with people who are one or two layers below you in organizations much like yours. I\u2019ll leave it as an exercise to the reader whether they\u2019re just like yours. And here\u2019s what the experiment looks like. I ask people, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you two choices. Choice A, choice B. Choice A, you can give a million dollars, bottom line, to your company through your efforts this year. Guaranteed. 100 percent. That\u2019s choice A. Choice B, you can give a billion dollars, bottom line, to your company through your efforts this year with one chance in a hundred. Choice A. Choice B.\u201d Who wants to do Choice A? Who\u2019s going to do Choice A for the company? Absolutely nobody raises their hand. Who\u2019s going to do Choice B? Everybody raises their hand. So, congratulations. I mean I\u2019m not even testing you guys. I\u2019m sure you can all do the math in your head. The expected utility is ten times as high for choice B as for choice A. Now, universally, these people are listening to me because they think that I\u2019m going to give them the special sauce about how to make innovation. And I say, \u201cYou already know the answer.\u201d Now, here\u2019s the tricky bit. Does your boss want you to pick Choice A? Raise your hand if you think that your boss would let you pick Choice B. Not a single hand in the room goes up. They don\u2019t need a lecture from me in how to be innovative. They need to change their context or, maybe, their boss can become smart just before they quit [inaudible] [00:06:51] and change the context for them. The context matters so much. The expectations matter so much. The people matter, the resources matter, but that\u2019s not the biggest issue. There have been these times in the world \u2013\u00a0and sadly, they\u2019ve been mostly military in nature \u2013\u00a0where you get a huge number of really smart people together \u2013\u00a0you know, not five or ten, but a hundred or more. And you give them the resources, but much more importantly, the expectation that they will produce miracles. The founding of Bletchley Park and the creation of modern computer science and cryptography, or the harnessing of the atom at the Manhattan Project \u2013\u00a0these are examples that we\u2019re all sort of well schooled in. And I like the phrase \u201cmoonshot thinking,\u201d because it points us at one of the few examples \u2013\u00a0this is JFK\u2019s speech at Rice University, and then the Apollo 11 Mission after that that actually put someone on the Moon, to remind us, it doesn\u2019t have to be about war, that you can create that same kind of exigency without war. Why do we have to wait for a war to say to a group of people, \u201cYou can do it. You can go ten times bigger. You can change the world that much \u2013\u00a0a huge change, not an incremental change. I expect that from you, and I don\u2019t want you \u2013\u00a0metaphorically and literally \u2013\u00a0to choose choice A. Your job is choice B,\u201d to tell those people and to give them that freedom. So, the question is, are you in that context? Are you creating that context for your organization? Because that\u2019s the hard part. You know, people will flock to you once you\u2019ve actually created the context. They\u2019re not that hard to find. It\u2019s making the context that\u2019s the hard part. So, you need to set up part of your organization \u2013\u00a0I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to think all of your organization can be like this. It\u2019s very hard to think \u2013 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic \u2013 that everyone\u2019s going to be choosing choice B. You need some people choosing choice A. But they can\u2019t all be choosing choice A. So, you need to take a set of people, and you put them on the side. This is probably not 50 percent of your company\u2019s resources, but it\u2019s not 1 percent, either. It\u2019s probably like 5 or 10 percent. You can afford it. You can\u2019t afford not to over some ten-year period, actually. You will be eaten alive, because other people are getting better at doing this. Maybe it\u2019s not worth it. Who cares? Why \u201cgo big\u201d like that? You know, Icarus died and Daedalus lived, right? So, maybe incremental improvement \u2013 slow and steady wins the race. We have all these phrases for that. Let me give you \u2013\u00a0I have all these sort of perspectives in my mind on why this doesn\u2019t work, but here\u2019s one of my favorite ones. How many of you know the \u201cmutilated checkerboard\u201d problem? It\u2019s a famous psychology experiment from almost 40 years ago now. So, here\u2019s how it works. Somebody sits down each of the subjects with a checkerboard \u2013\u00a0which has 64 squares on it if you haven\u2019t looked recently \u2013 and gives them 32 dominoes \u2013\u00a0each domino can perfectly cover a vertical or horizontal pair of squares \u2013\u00a0and says to each of the subjects, \u201cCan you cover this board perfectly with your dominoes?\u201d And every single subject, independent of IQ, within 30 seconds says, \u201cYeah, duh.\u201d And then, they get a little devious \u2013\u00a0the research does \u2013\u00a0and cuts off the upper left-hand square from the checkerboard and the bottom right-hand square, and takes away one of their dominoes and says, \u201cCan you still cover? You have 62 squares and 31 dominoes. Can you still cover your board with these dominoes?\u201d And now every single person, independent of IQ, stalls, unable to demonstrate a solution or prove that there isn\u2019t one. Doesn\u2019t seem like it would be that hard. Turns out it is. Now, if the researcher writes the word \u201csalt,\u201d just the word \u201csalt,\u201d on the white squares, and \u201cpepper\u201d on the black squares, everyone solves it within 30 seconds. Everybody. And peanut butter and jelly would work as well \u2013\u00a0may be better if they\u2019re brown and red. And the insight is that you\u2019ve had two salts or two peppers \u2013\u00a0depending on the orientation of the board \u2013 removed, and each domino covers one salt and one pepper, whichever way you turn it, so there\u2019s now not the same number of salt and peppers left. That perspective shift is what it\u2019s all about. That\u2019s why going ten times bigger is more important and works better than going 10 percent bigger. When you shoot for 10 percent better, you\u2019re in a smartness contest \u2013\u00a0you\u2019re putting all of your people in a smartness contest with everyone else in the world. They\u2019re not going to win. It doesn\u2019t matter how much money you give them. But if you push them, if you give them the expectation and the freedom to be weird, that\u2019s moonshot thinking. Then, they can do the perspective shifts. And not only \u2013 if you shoot for ten times bigger instead of 10 percent bigger, it\u2019s almost never a hundred times harder, and the payoff is a hundred times, so you already know that you\u2019ve got a better return on your investment. But sometimes it\u2019s literally easier, and the reason is because that perspective shift is actually cheap relative to being smarter than everyone around you. So, you need to create this organization that looks more like Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory than an \u201cincubator\u201d or an \u201cinnovation center.\u201d Any place that\u2019s called an \u201cinnovation center\u201d isn\u2019t, almost by definition. And you need to fill it with Peter Pans with PhDs \u2013\u00a0people who wear T-shirts that say \u201cSafety Third\u201d on them. Right? That\u2019s \u2013 Speaker: I love that [\u2026 ] great. Astro Teller: You need these people to understand and to feel good about the fact that they\u2019re going to fail most of the time. It\u2019s not a maybe. There\u2019s no way that they won\u2019t fail most of the time. And you have to impress upon them \u2013\u00a0and it is possible, they love it once you let them go \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s not just a moonshot and moonshot thinking when you choose to go big at the high level. You impress upon them that it\u2019s moonshots all the way down. That in every sub-problem, rather than being clinical and traditional about how they approach the architecture for that problem, or hiring people for that problem, or how they fail fast and test things for that problem, they can be weirder. They can shoot to be ten times better than anyone has every done before in each of those sub-problems. And in each of those ways, it will again pay off because the perspective shifts will unlock more than smartness will. And, at least my experience is if these people are surrounded by a dura of business speak, you will ruin it all. If they believe that they have to have a business plan for the weirdness that they are embarked upon, you will kill it, absolutely \u2013 stillbirth guaranteed. But if you tell them that moonshot thinking is identifying an enormous problem with the world, picking a science fiction-sounding product or service which, if it could be made, would make that problem go away, and that there\u2019s some set of technical plausible reasons, at least a glimmer of hope,\u00a0that you could actually make that science fiction-sounding product or service that would make that problem go away, that problem, making it go away, is unlocking enormous value in the world. Have faith. If you solve that problem, the money will come find your organization.
