One of them was The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph by Ryan Holiday (@ryanholiday). It has helped me to turn problems upside-down, look at them through a different lens, and even uncover unique opportunities. The Obstacle Is The Way is a collection of stories and principles about Stoicism, which I consider to be the ultimate personal \u201coperating system\u201d for anyone who wants to thrive in high-stress environments and situations. If you want to be antifragile like Thomas Jefferson, Marcus Aurelius, Bill Belichick, and many of the most dominant investors in history, Stoicism offers a real playbook. If you want to make better decisions, if you want to smile when other people cower, it offers real tools. To quote Andy Grove, former CEO of Intel, \u201cBad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.\u201d What if you could be a person who is improved by crisis? At the very least, it would give you opportunities no one else can see, let alone grasp. Much more important, it would make you a happier human being. Here are a few sample chapters from The Obstacle Is The Way.\u00a0Please enjoy! \n\nHow to Succeed in High-Stress Situations\nhttps://rss.art19.com/episodes/b7f9ff3d-82e5-46ae-9809-df3c621e72f2.mp3Download Want to hear another podcast\u00a0featuring Ryan Holiday and Stoicism?\u00a0\u2014 In this episode, we discuss the \u201cbig three\u201d Stoics, how Stoicism applies to the modern world, and how to improve your decision-making when stakes are high (stream below or right-click here to download):  This episode is brought to you by Teeter. Inversion therapy, which uses gravity and your own body weight to decompress the spine or relieve pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves, seems to help with a whole slew of conditions.
