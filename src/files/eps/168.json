Malcolm, can you tell me what you had for breakfast please? Malcolm Gladwell: I had a cappuccino and a third of a croissant. Tim Ferriss: A third of a croissant. Do you divvy it up over three days? Or is that just \u2013 was it a bad croissant? Malcolm Gladwell: No. I love croissants, but I feel like I think one should eat the absolute minimum in the morning. I don\u2019t think you should eat a lot in the morning. That\u2019s one of my rules. Tim Ferriss: Oh, we will explore that further. Thank you. [Sponsors/Ads] Tim Ferriss: Hello, boys and girls, ladies and squirrels. It is a late night in New York City, and the echo is from within the walls of a fine establishment, otherwise known as a hotel that I am calling my abode for this evening. Molly is curled up. All the children are snug in their beds with visions of sugar plums \u2013 no, that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. This is the Tim Ferriss Show, and welcome to another episode where it is my job to deconstruct world class experts and world class performers so that we can borrow their habits, routines, tools, test them ourselves, and improve how we perform in our personal and professional lives. And this episode features Malcolm Gladwell. I\u2019ve wanted to interview Malcolm quite a long time. And it finally happened. We had a proper sit down. We\u2019ve bumped into each other before a few times. But this was the first in depth conversation. And we cover a lot. Malcolm Gladwell @gladwell on Twitter, say hi, is the author of five New York Times best sellers, mega best sellers, The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers, What the Dog Saw, and David and Goliath. He has been named one of the 100 most influential people by Time magazine. He has explored how ideas spread, decision making, the roots of success, the advantages of disadvantages. And in his latest podcast project, Revisionist History, which I highly recommend, Gladwell examines the way the passage of time changes and enlightens our understanding of the world around us. He also revisits certain aspects of history that perhaps we should take another look at. And in this wide ranging, in depth, in person conversation, we cover a ton, including his research and writing process, how he learned to ask good questions, favorite books, routines, habits, tools, how he pulls together seemingly unrelated stories into a cohesive theme and, eventually, a book, his obsession with running, why he eats as little as possible in the mornings, and much more. It is highly tactical. There are some hilarious and great stories, some very surprising stuff that I\u2019m sure you have not heard anywhere else. And that is all I have to say about that. So please say hi to him on Twitter at Gladwell. And I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did. Thanks for listening. Malcolm, welcome to the show. Malcolm Gladwell: Thank you, Tim. Tim Ferriss: I really appreciate you making the time. And I know we\u2019ve bumped into each other a few times over the years. I remember I want to say the first time was at a salon that Peter Teal put together about religion, ethics, and morality or something like that. It was ages ago. Malcolm Gladwell: Years ago. Tim Ferriss: Years ago, and I remember showing up. And Orin Hoffman who had co-hosted the event was a friend of mine, and he was like, \u201cHey, would you mind just improving and speaking at this event for a few minutes about X, Y, or Z? We haven\u2019t decided on the topics yet.\u201d And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d Then, I showed up, and I see Malcolm Gladwell. I see some award winning, voted favorite teacher of the decade Harvard professor, and that\u2019s when I started drinking really heavily. So I suspect it was a poor performance on my part. In preparation for this because I\u2019ve been looking forward to it, I pinged Steven Dubner, Freakonomics, a mutual friend. And his response was short. \u201cIt was fun! He\u2019s a great talker. He likes to talk about writing, running, fast cars, not golf, being Canadian. Sorry, got to run.\u201d Something along those lines, and he took off. And I was planning to speak with you about at least one or two of those, and I thought we could start with writing. Malcolm Gladwell: Okay. Tim Ferriss: What have been the easiest and hardest books for you to write? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, that\u2019s an interesting question. I don\u2019t find writing \u2013 or to the extent that I find writing, I link hard and fun. So if it\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s not fun. So I never think about writing in terms of hard and easy. I think about it in terms of fun and not fun. So which one was the most fun? Probably the last two, mostly because I wrote the first book while I was still working pretty much full time at the New Yorker. So I just didn\u2019t have a lot of time. And that makes it less fun. You can\u2019t really savor and appreciate it. But the last two, I took as much time as I needed and, deliberately, dragged it out because I was enjoying myself so much. So I think probably the last two books were the \u2013 so does that mean the last two were the hardest? Tim Ferriss: The hardest/most fun. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes, I think they were because I was trying to tell better stories. I became convinced, about 15 years ago or so, if I was to develop as a writer, I had to be a better story teller. And so Outliers and What the Dog Saw were books where I was really, really trying to do a better job. And sorry, David and Goliath. I was really trying to do a better job of telling good stories. Tim Ferriss: Are there any people who come to mind, fictional or otherwise, who are good storytellers? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. Michael Louis is the gold standard. And it was actually in reading Michael Louis that I realized that I wanted to be \u2013 you can\u2019t be him any more than you can \u2013 you can\u2019t say I watch Jeff Curry play basketball, and I decided that\u2019s the kind of basketball player I want to be. You can be inspired by him. You could pattern your play after him. But you can\u2019t be him. That\u2019s impossible. So I was inspired by Michael Louis to get better, but I am not on his level. Tim Ferriss: I think both of you are very, very good at taking what could be dense, impenetrable material or overwhelming material and making it a story that is easy to consume as storytelling and consuming machines. Malcolm Gladwell: I tell a million stories in one book. He tells one story. That\u2019s so much harder. Tim Ferriss: What makes that harder? Malcolm Gladwell: Because you have to go to a level of complexity and have confidence. What happens is that I lose confidence. And the reason that I tell lots of stories is that I don\u2019t have the confidence to keep going with the same one. I think everyone must be losing interest. I\u2019ve got to switch and do something else now. Michael doesn\u2019t have that problem. He has the kind of panache to say I\u2019m going to tell you a story about a guy, basically, trying to take on the high speed traders. And we\u2019re going to do this for 200 pages, and you\u2019re going to love it. I can\u2019t start with that. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s part of the reason I also write my books in, and I\u2019m not in any way comparing myself to you or \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell: You have every right to, Tim. Tim Ferriss: Well, I\u2019m a teacher who dabbles in writing and sometimes puts stuff down that\u2019s intelligible. But the way that I tend to nonlinearly write my books and encourage people to consume it in a nonlinear way is precisely for that reason because I work that if, in some cases, I can keep something interesting for 15 or 20 pages. But I lack the confidence that I can do it for 200 or 300. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. You\u2019ve got to be good to pull off that feat, particularly with the sorts of topics that he chooses, which are esoteric. He wrote a gripping thriller about credit swaps and derivatives. I mean, that\u2019s not easy. Tim Ferriss: Not easy at all. I mean, then you have Saver Metrics. And he\u2019s so consistent. The next question I wanted to ask was related to, it\u2019s a perennial topic, of course, but writers\u2019 block or anything that you might consider something like that. And it\u2019s related to the kind of module, choose your own adventure like way in which I write myself, which is one way that I can put something on the shelf if I\u2019m having trouble with it and move on to something else. It doesn\u2019t have to be sequential. Do you run into writers\u2019 block? If so, how does that manifest, and what do you do? Or do you get stuck? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, I worked for 10 years at a newspaper. And if that experience teaches you anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t have writers\u2019 block. I mean, you quite literally can\u2019t. You\u2019ll start the story at 10:30, and it\u2019s due at 4:00 or 4:30 or whatever. Back in those days, there were hard deadlines. So you can\u2019t have it. It\u2019s unthinkable. Tim Ferriss: You don\u2019t have the luxury. Malcolm Gladwell: And if you went to your bosses, and you said, \u201cI\u2019m blocked on this story,\u201d they would look at you like you were insane. Tim Ferriss: Take off your beret, put down your poetry, you have a job to do. Malcolm Gladwell: So it\u2019s like there\u2019s not even an issue. So I did used to have these issues, and then, I went to the Washington Post. And you get cured in a hurry of any pretentions you have about your writing. And you just keep typing. There\u2019s no kind of alternative. And luckily, I have those habits that I learned over that 10 years at the Washington Post have stayed with me. And also, writing a book is maybe 20 percent writing and 80 percent organization, logistics. So I will think about something. For every hour I spend writing, I spend three hours thinking about writing. So usually, when I\u2019m writing, first of all, it\u2019s a tiny period. And secondly, it\u2019s all worked out already. I\u2019m just putting down on the page what has already been kind of figured out in my head. Tim Ferriss: Is that true also for a shorter piece in say the New Yorker? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. Not all of it, but I know what I\u2019m doing before I start. Or I know what the pieces are. Tim Ferriss: Can you give an example of any piece or any book where it started and what the process was for you in getting to the point that you\u2019re then putting words down on paper? And the reason I ask is that I am fascinated by structure. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly gifted at. But I did, long ago, take a class with John McPhee, one of your colleagues, staff writer at the New Yorker. And his grasp and approach to structure is just incredible, at least the way that he visualizes his structure. But he has a very particular process. I can\u2019t follow his say day to day schedule, which is, basically, sitting in front of a blank piece of paper from like 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 p.m. whether anything is written or not, which would lead me to just want to throw my head through a window. Can you give us any origin story of any book or piece? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. Some were easy. I did a story for the New Yorker last fall about a school shooter in Minnesota. And that was super easy because I wanted to write about school shootings. I started routed around on the internet, and I find this criminal complaint and transcript of an interrogation of a kid who was caught, basically, in the act, a would be school shooter caught in the act. And it\u2019s like 60 pages. And this absolutely extraordinary account of what he was thinking and what he was planning to do and why he was planning to do it. And when you find something like that, I mean, your job is done. So you\u2019re like oh, I\u2019m going to tell this story. And then, I\u2019m going to step away only to kind of put that story in broader context. So those are rare. That wrote itself. That\u2019s rare. What are harder are things that have less obvious structure. So my book, Outliers, began with there was a chapter in that book about Jewish lawyers. About this curious fact that the group, a core group of Jewish lawyers in New York City who rose to prominence in the \u201860s and \u201870s and basically kind of take over corporate law in the city, all had strikingly similar backgrounds. And so that\u2019s the first chapter I wrote in Outliers. And that sort of is where I began that book because I met one of the \u2013 one of those lawyers was the father of a friend of mine. I met him, and I talked to him. I was like oh, wait a minute. All of his buddies, they\u2019re all from the same part of the Bronx. They all were born in practically the same year. They all went to City College. They all went to NYU Law School. They all started in the same kind of firms. I mean, it\u2019s the same story again and again and again. And if you think about it, if one were, I don\u2019t know why one would, but if one were to study that book, Outliers, you would discover that almost all of the themes that I explore in that book are present in the story of the Jewish lawyers. So everything is there. So I reported that story. I wrote that chapter. I thought about it. I was like oh, all of the strands that I\u2019m interested in are there. I\u2019m going to pull out strand after strand and write chapters about them. Tim Ferriss: Did it start off in your head as a chapter in a prospective book? Or was it a standalone? Malcolm Gladwell: No. I wanted to write a book about successful people. And so it was always going to be a chapter in the book. But it was just a lucky place to start because, when you can start with one of those, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best chapter in the book, but it is, functionally, the most important chapter in the book. Tim Ferriss: Because it had all of the macro elements in the micro. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes. And that\u2019s the gold standard when you can begin on that kind of note. Other ones have been much more difficult because they haven\u2019t had that. Tim Ferriss: Now, let\u2019s say you have that story, you have that chapter, how do you go about collecting \u2013 and let me take a step backwards. What tools were you using to query and find this 60 page transcript of the would be school shooter? Malcolm Gladwell: I honestly don\u2019t remember. I was screwing around on the internet. I was interested in school shootings. And I don\u2019t even know how. There was zero coverage of this case. It was in the local Minnesota Press, that\u2019s it. I never heard of it. The kid was caught before he did anything. So it never made national headlines. And the transcript is just on the website of the local DA. So it\u2019s like and I don\u2019t know how I found it. I can\u2019t remember. I just found it. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019d be so curious to know. Malcolm Gladwell: I would love to know now, too. It was just one of those \u2013 but other cases, like in my podcast, for example, one of the episodes I like the most, two episodes actually, touch on this question. So one is an episode, I think it\u2019s the eighth or ninth episode, it\u2019s called Generous Orthodoxy. And it\u2019s the story of a 98-year-old Mennonite pastor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania who takes on his church. And I come from a very Mennonite area in Ontario. Many of my friends and brother\u2019s friends are Mennonites. My brother is a Mennonite. I know that world really well. I go home at Christmas, and everyone is talking about this guy. And when I say everyone, the number Mennonites in North America is very small. It\u2019s a very small, evangelical, Protestant sect denomination. But they\u2019re talking about this letter this guy wrote. It\u2019s got a lot of Facebook likes for them. And he\u2019s 98. So I read the letter, and I\u2019m like oh, my goodness. What an extraordinary letter. So I track down the guy, I interview him like a week later. I drive out to Lancaster. And I look at the transcript, and I say what\u2019s this about? And I realize that what it\u2019s about is how to protest. He\u2019s a guy who is so wise, and it\u2019s an extraordinary interview. Again, I did nothing. It\u2019s one of those cases where he\u2019s just amazing. And I stumbled into this. It\u2019s 10:00 at night on a cold, Saturday night in January. I\u2019m in this little, tiny house on the turnpike in Lancaster, Pennsylvania talking to a 98-year-old guy. And it\u2019s one of those amazing interviews where it\u2019s just all there. I don\u2019t have to do anything. And I\u2019m crying by the end. It\u2019s just insane. So I go home, and I look, and it\u2019s like I want to make a podcast about this. And what\u2019s amazing now is I\u2019m not writing this up in print. I\u2019m using this man\u2019s own words, which because he\u2019s so insanely moving, powerful, it\u2019s just like so much better that I can hear his voice. And so the question is what does this story need to be finished? Not a lot. Just a little bit to put it in context. So there\u2019s a case where you stumble across something. And your only role is not to screw it up. Don\u2019t screw it up. Don\u2019t bury it. Just put him out there, tell the story, and then, just find some other little element that makes it clear to the listener what it\u2019s about. That\u2019s my favorite Revisionist History episode for that reason. It\u2019s just so pure and simple. Tim Ferriss: When you have, let\u2019s say in the case of the Outlier chapter on Jewish lawyers, how do you capture your notes and organize your notes on something like that? What tools do you use? Malcolm Gladwell: It\u2019s going to sound so old school. I transcribe the interview, print out the transcript, and underline the parts I like. And then, move them into a file. Tim Ferriss: And is it a Word file? What type of file is it? I know this is getting very \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell: It\u2019s a Word file, yeah. It\u2019s like move from one Word file to the next Word file. I don\u2019t even use Google Docs. I mean, I vaguely, recently got into Google Docs. But I sort of feel like it doesn\u2019t really matter. Tim Ferriss: I would agree. Whether it\u2019s a pen or paint brush or crayons, you still have to know how to use the writing implement. But the process is interesting to me. So if you take these quotes, what qualifies, and this may seem like a sort of infantile question, but what qualifies as interesting? Malcolm Gladwell: No, it\u2019s not an infantile question. That is, in fact, the core question. To the extent that a writer deserves his or her paycheck, it comes down to how good are they at looking through a transcript and understanding what\u2019s interesting. You have to sort of visualize what the story is going to become before it has become anything. So you might be dealing with a document that is 20,000 words or even longer. It could be 30,000 words, which is enormous. I mean, my books are 75, 000 words. So you\u2019re dealing with a single interview that might be a third of a book in length. And you have to distill out of that, I don\u2019t know, a couple thousand words. So that process can take days. And I initially go through, and I simply delete all of the stuff that clearly doesn\u2019t belong. Just that dead space. And then, I just take repeated passes, pruning and pruning and pruning until I know the interview almost by heart. And then, what I\u2019m left with is the stuff that matters. If you don\u2019t transcribe it yourself, it\u2019s so much harder. There are enormous benefits to taking that huge amount of time necessary to transcribe it yourself. Tim Ferriss: To transcribe yourself. And once you have these nuggets, these various highlights, how do you determine what starts a chapter or a book for that matter? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, that\u2019s the other thing. That\u2019s another thing that kind of qualifies you as a writer. The truth is that there are so many ways you can do it. There are so many answers to the problem that I don\u2019t get too hung up on it. I sort of think that it\u2019s not a math question where there\u2019s only one answer. So as long as you understand there is not just one good answer, it takes the pressure off. But, typically, I might try out several openings. It\u2019s made easier by the fact that I don\u2019t start at the beginning. So once you don\u2019t start at the beginning, your life just gets so much simpler. Tim Ferriss: So on that point, I have a tendency to always try the, and I think this has become a bit of a crutch for me because it seems to work well, but it\u2019s become a bit of a trope, if that\u2019s the right word, for me where I\u2019m always doing in media rests. So I\u2019m always taking some exciting moment right in the middle of X that then requires explanation. And I get into that later in the piece. But I found myself doing that, effectively, all of the time. Not to turn this into like a writer/doctor consultation. But do you ever find yourself doing that and you\u2019re like, this recipe works, but I want to play with other recipes? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, that\u2019s why I wanted to do a podcast like this so much, which was that, with a podcast, you\u2019re still storytelling. But suddenly, the list of considerations is different. It really matters how good your tape is, how powerful the voices are, how meaningful the interaction you have with the person you\u2019re interviewing is. So all of those things, do you have archival tape that is incredibly powerful? So one of the shows is about, another of my favorites, I have two favorites, this is the other one, it\u2019s about giving. It sounds boring when I say that. It\u2019s about university of philanthropy. And I contrast two very wealthy men who reach very different conclusions about where they\u2019re going to give their money. And one of the men is my hero, and one is my villain. And the hero, I don\u2019t want to spoil it, but there was a little bit of tape, the hero had just died. And the school that he had given his money to had a memorial service for him. And at the memorial service, a local a cappella group sang a kind of semi cheesy, boy band song, and I have forgotten the title of it, in memoriam of him but in such a way that it wasn\u2019t cheesy anymore. It was actually, really touching. And so you hear this tape, and you hear this a cappella group singing a song. And your initial thought is, oh, my God. And then, you\u2019re like oh, and you get it. The emotion hits you. Now, if you\u2019re writing about that, it\u2019s meaningless. All of that nuance is lost. In a podcast, suddenly, you\u2019re like oh, wow, that\u2019s my beginning. No question. That\u2019s the way in because you want that movement from oh, this is cheesy to oh, my God, no. It\u2019s incredibly meaningful. That little thing. So that\u2019s what lovely. It\u2019s, suddenly, after 20 years of doing the pure print thing, I have to break out of that and think in a different way about what\u2019s powerful. Tim Ferriss: You are a very good public speaker. I think you\u2019re a tremendous speaker. How do you plan your keynotes because this is, yet, a different format? If you think of your most successful, so then perhaps a less successful, presentation, how have they differed? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, first of all, the breakthrough for me in speaking came when I realized that it required about 10 X more work than I was giving to it. And that was a huge moment. So I decided do \u2013 Tim Ferriss: What made you realize that? Sorry to interrupt. Was there a particular incident or conversation? Malcolm Gladwell: No, it was about 10 years ago when I asked myself the question do I want to continue doing this because it has its pluses and its minuses. And I realized I only want to continue doing it if I get much better at it and if I change it in a way that it\u2019s much more meaningful to me. So it was then I decided I needed way more material. I have to give very, very different speeches. I can\u2019t just give the same one all of the time. I have to spend a lot more time thinking about who I\u2019m speaking to. And I have to spend a lot more time thinking about my performance, and, realizing, by the way, that it is a performance. That I\u2019m not giving a speech, I\u2019m giving a performance. And all of those things, I thought a lot about all of those things. And it took a long time to kind of fully implement them. But it has made it much more interesting to me. And I enjoy it in a way I didn\u2019t enjoy it when I was \u2013 I didn\u2019t feel like I was doing it in a kind of halfway manner. But I realized, in retrospect, I was just because I hadn\u2019t understood. I thought that what giving a speech was was reading an article. And if you think that\u2019s what it is, then, you just get up, and you read your article. Actually, no, it\u2019s a world that has its own rules and principles. You\u2019re really acting. Then, you\u2019re like oh, wow, that\u2019s totally different. I\u2019ve got to throw myself into that in a significant way. And so that\u2019s what I tried to do. Tim Ferriss: Is there anyone in the world of speaking, alive or dead, who is the Michael Louis for you? Malcolm Gladwell: I once went to a birthday party for an old, old friend of mine. And it was in England. I can say my friend Anne Applebaum. She\u2019s been in England for years, and she has all of these sort of kind of fancy English friends. When I say fancy, not posh but historians and just kind of English intellectuals. So she had this birthday party in this little country house in the middle of England. And the English, of course, A) way better at giving speeches than we are, first of all. But secondly, we were talking about the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of English speech givers. Like serious kind of Cambridge and Oxford debating society kind of people. So then Neil Ferguson, the historian, gave a birthday toast, which is just the best toast I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. I mean, it was like so much better than anything I\u2019d ever heard. It was on another level. I was like oh, my God, that\u2019s good. And part of what made it genius was he really gave you the impression he was making it up on the spot. Now, he might, actually, have one that. He may be so good he could do that. But he got up, and the conceit was this is off the cuff. This is totally spontaneous. And it was so cleverly done and so hilarious. And the other thing I realized was that it was so charming. And what was charming about it was the ways in which he was wrong. Kind of part of the joke was he was going to make this elaborate, hilarious argument about Anne who was turning 50. And half the stuff that he was going to say was not right. That was sort of like \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Did he start off saying that? Malcolm Gladwell: No, no. He sort of spun a theory about the weekend and about her birthday and about her friends. That was like hilarious because it was not accurate. But it was like he did it with such panache. And first of all, that would never have occurred to me to make stuff up in such a dramatic way. But also, I can do conversational. I don\u2019t think I ever got to the level where people think I\u2019m off the cuff. I\u2019m not. It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s been some effort here. But with him, it was just like \u2013 I worship the guy. I think he walks on water. Tim Ferriss: What are the elements of a good performance for you? What are some of the ingredients that make a good performance, in your case? Malcolm Gladwell: The thing that I strive for in speaking is authenticity, which sounds corny. But it\u2019s really hard to do when you\u2019re giving a prepared talk to a group of people who belong to a world that you don\u2019t belong to. So if I\u2019m speaking to a group of IT specialists, I don\u2019t know anything about IT, right? Nothing. So I\u2019m an outsider. And I\u2019m trying to say something that will engage them and be intelligent and make them think. So in the context of doing something that is artificial, by artificial I don\u2019t mean phony, I mean, in a sense that I have to make an effort to connect with them. I can\u2019t just stand up and talk the way I would talk to my friends. These guys belong to a world I don\u2019t know or belong to. So I\u2019m doing something that requires an effort. But, at the same time, it has to feel like me. They have to feel like they are connecting with me and that I can\u2019t feel like I\u2019m faking it. So that\u2019s hard. And that\u2019s hard in a good way. That\u2019s what makes it interesting. So the question I ask myself is I would like to say something intelligent about IT while still remaining true to myself, someone who knows very little about IT. So and if you pull it off, that\u2019s interesting to the audience. So they get that. They\u2019re not bringing me in because I\u2019m an IT specialist. But what satisfies them is my attempt to speak to them while being true to myself. Can I bridge the gap is the question really that they\u2019re asking themselves in the back of their mind. And when you can bridge the gap, that\u2019s really satisfying to someone. It\u2019s like I think you\u2019ve succeeded. Tim Ferriss: And just a few more questions about writing because I\u2019m most likely about to go into, as we discussed briefly, a crunch writing deadline myself. When you have, for instance, one or two stories for a book, and you understand what the theme is going to be or some of the structural components, how do you find the others? Or is it a case where you\u2019ve gathered these stories over the span of a time with the inkling of an idea, and then, you have half of it locked and loaded already? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, there\u2019s a good example of this from Revisionist History, from this podcast. I started out by wanting to tell a story about this kid who I had met who was a teenager and lived in LA, came from a poor family, and had, I don\u2019t know what his IQ is, 150. He\u2019s a one in a million kid. And I thought his story of what happens to you if you have an IQ of 150, and you grow up in South Central. That\u2019s sort of interesting. So I was going to tell that story. And so I talked to the kid. And I was particularly interested in how does he get to college? Is it easy? Do you get recognized? Is it like you\u2019re a great 15-year-old basketball player, and they always find you? If you can dunk a basketball and hit a three point shot, and you could dominate your middle school basketball team, and you live in Nebraska, they find you, right? So my question was is that what it\u2019s like if you\u2019ve got an IQ of 150 and you live in South Central, do they just find you and adopt you? So I went out, and I had this long conversation with this kid. It was incredibly powerful. It was totally interesting. And then, as I tell the story, I realize, oh, so my episodes are 45 minutes. And I realized this story is all I need. He\u2019s the whole thing. I can do little contextual things. But there\u2019s no room for anything else here. Not just room logistically or physically, but there\u2019s no emotional room for anything else. This kid is \u2013 you\u2019re in tears by the end. And what happened to him, and his story is crazy. And then, there\u2019s this other kid we talk about. It\u2019s like you can\u2019t. So then, I said there are other things I wanted to say. So I do another show also on the same topic of how good are we at fulfilling the America dream, the American promise, which is, if you work hard, and you have some ability, you can make your way up the ladder. So this part of Revisionist History is revisiting that promise that we make. How good are we at fulfilling it? So I do a second show, which is all about do colleges find these kids? Do they do a good job of finding them? How do they find them? Do they spend a lot of time and money on it? And the answer is the colleges do a terrible job of finding them. So we asked why. So I did a show on why do they do a terrible job. And the answer is, a lot of the time, they\u2019re distracted. But more than that, they\u2019re spending their money somewhere else. It takes money to find these kids. Not just to find them, if the cost of educating a kid is $50,000.00, and you want to bring in a kid from South Central, he doesn\u2019t have $50,000.00. So you\u2019ve got to pay $50,000.00. You\u2019re out $50,000.00 if you want to bring him to your school. So if you\u2019re going to spend $50,000.00 on him, it\u2019s $50,000.00 you can\u2019t spend on something else. That starts to get really interesting. All right. So what\u2019s the thing you can\u2019t spend on? And if you can\u2019t spend on that other thing, how do you compete with other colleges that do spend on the other thing? So that\u2019s what the whole upset is about. So then, I do that one, and I\u2019m like wait a minute, I\u2019m not done. This gets more interesting. So if you\u2019ve got to find the $50,000.00, then where do you get the $50,000.00? So now, we get into philanthropy. That\u2019s where I did this whole thing on philanthropy. So that was the third one. So these are all stories that grow out of \u2013 it all starts with one kid. I find the kid, and all of a sudden, I end up with three very different stories all of which look at the problem of the kid from a different angle. And that\u2019s very typical of the way books work for me, which is you start with the nugget, and then, you just start walking around it. And parts of it just kind of \u2013 you\u2019re like oh, that deserves its own \u2013 it\u2019s like the thing I find myself doing when I interview someone, most often, is stopping them. Saying wait, wait, wait. When I transcribe the tapes, I hear that so many times. Wait, wait, stop. And then, I make them go back and elaborate on that point, which was like that kind of weird point. They skip over it because it\u2019s old hat to them. And you\u2019re like no, no, no. I could spend hours on that point, you know? Tim Ferriss: Oh, I do. I know exactly how that feels. And it strikes me that you ask questions as part of that walking around the first story. And you ask a question that then redirects you or focuses you into another topic. You find a story, and then, you ask another question, which then leads to, in this case, another episode, but it could have been another chapter of a book. If you were to credit someone or some people or resources with helping you to get better at asking questions, who or what would that be? Malcolm Gladwell: My dad is a great question asker. And my father has this, and I\u2019ve spoken about it many times, of his many gifts, one in particular, as a kid, always had the biggest impact on me, which is my father has zero intellectual insecurities. So this is the only thing he has in common with Obama. He and Obama are the same way. It has never crossed his mind to be concerned that the world thinks he\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019s not in that game. So if he doesn\u2019t understand something, he just asks you. He doesn\u2019t care if he sounds foolish. He will ask the most obvious question. And it was without any sort of concern about it. And maybe it\u2019s because my dad is a mathematician. So he has this thing that he knows he\u2019s really good at.\u00a0And so he\u2019s home free. If you have a PhD in math, you\u2019re home free. Tim Ferriss: Well, if something is either true or it\u2019s false, or it\u2019s clear or it\u2019s not. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. And it\u2019s like if you look like an idiot because you don\u2019t know anything about basketball, who cares? So he asks lots and lots and lots of dumb, in the best sense of that word, dumb questions. He\u2019ll say to someone I don\u2019t understand. Explain that to me. And he\u2019ll just keep asking questions until he gets it right. And I grew up listening to him do this in every conceivable setting. My father, here is this guy with his PhD in math. He made friends with all of these farmers who were our neighbors who were all drop outs. Tim Ferriss: This was in Canada. Malcolm Gladwell: In Canada. They all had, basically, maybe seventh grade. And he, first of all, treated them like equals. And secondly, he was intensely interested in what they knew that he didn\u2019t know and would ask them tons and tons of questions about why they did what they did. So that\u2019s what I grew up around. And that\u2019s what I do. I mean, it\u2019s straight from my dad. And when I\u2019m hanging out with my father and someone interesting, we do the same thing. We just start asking questions. It\u2019s our sort of thing. Tim Ferriss: Well, it strikes me also that the dumb questions or the obvious questions are precisely the questions, often times, we should be asking because half of the people in the room, if it\u2019s in a group setting, are probably thinking of those questions anyway but are embarrassed, for whatever reason, to bring them up. Malcolm Gladwell: Do you know what is a great example of this? I often imagine my dad meeting Bernie Madoff. My father would look at the returns, and he would say, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really good.\u201d Because, as a mathematician, he would know that these steady, whatever it was, 9 percent a year, year in/year out. And he would say, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d And Madoff had, remember, that stock explanation that was bullshit. And my father would just simply continue to ask really, really, dumb, obvious questions until Madoff would either have had to leave because he would have tried his patience and been at risk of \u2013 but he would never have invested money with him because he would have said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d 100 times. I don\u2019t understand how that works. I don\u2019t understand. Like in this kind of dumb kind of slow voice. I don\u2019t understand, sir. What is going on? Tim Ferriss: So let me ask, and feel free to not answer this if you don\u2019t want. So I ask a lot of questions. I enjoy asking a lot of questions. It can drive some people crazy. Did your mom get the 20 questions about a lot of things? Or was the relationship different? Malcolm Gladwell: Oh, she asked lots of questions, too. She\u2019s not intellectually insecure either. It wasn\u2019t directed at my mother. It was directed at the outside world. They have an exceedingly harmonious relationship. They don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s reserved for outsiders really. Tim Ferriss: To what would you attribute the harmony? Because there are a lot of unharmonious relationships in the world. Malcolm Gladwell: I mean, they were lucky to be well suited. They\u2019re also both incredibly calm people. So they have very little conflict because they diffuse conflict really well. I think it probably would be a good way of saying it. Tim Ferriss: So they can speak rationally. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. I\u2019ve never seen them pick a fight with each other, for example. It doesn\u2019t interest them. Tim Ferriss: I have so many questions that I want to ask you. I\u2019m just going to jump into a rather non cohesive list of miscellanea. I\u2019m going to try some new ones this time around. What is the best or most worthwhile investment you\u2019ve ever made?\u00a0It could be money, time, energy, or otherwise, or just a very good investment. Malcolm Gladwell: That\u2019s an interesting question. All of the investments, the most worthwhile investments, are investments about time. They have to do with time. And they\u2019re all about persevering past the point that I would normally have quit. So I can think, for example, of books where the payoff didn\u2019t come until Page 1,000. And yet, getting to that page was incredibly important in some future endeavor. Or when I was describing how I ran across that transcript of that school shooter, which that was about an investment of time where I was sort of looking for much longer than I would normally look. I kind of, for reasons I don\u2019t really understand, put my impatience aside committed a much longer period of time to that hunt. So I would say those are probably the, it\u2019s a very broad category, but those were the best investments. Tim Ferriss: Now, when you said Page 1,000, you\u2019re talking about reading? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. But, I mean, generally speaking, hunting \u2013 so many of the really wonderful things that I\u2019ve uncovered in my life, not just from my writing, but also personally, have come after elongated hunts. So you never find the thing that is moving and powerful in the first five minutes. It just doesn\u2019t happen. Tim Ferriss: I remember a friend of mine who I didn\u2019t really feel very friendly towards when he said this said to me, when I was 90 percent done with my second book, The Four Hour Body, and I said, \u201cWow, I\u2019m pretty close to the finish line, 90 percent done.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cCongratulations. You only have 50 percent left.\u201d And I\u2019ve heard that from a lot of long distance runners also. Like how the race starts at Mile 20 or whatever it might be. Going back to the sort of investments and these not postponed but delayed gratification wins like this Page 1,000, can you think of any failures that set you up for later success or a favorite failure of yours? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s all kinds. When I was a kid, this is one of many, but I was a very serious runner. Tim Ferriss: What distance? Malcolm Gladwell: The 1,500 meters and 800 meters. Tim Ferriss: The puking distances. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes. And in my third year of running seriously, I lost races I thought I was going to win in what for me, at that age, was quite a traumatic fashion. And I quit running. And I would regard that as the first real failure of my life, something I really wanted to do well at, I didn\u2019t. And I feel like it was hugely important both because it made me think hard about what my priorities were. I had placed running too high in that list. But more than that, I then, later in life, went back and thought a lot about why I quit and was dissatisfied with my reasons. So this whole notion of circling back I think is so important. This show is called Revisionist History. So it\u2019s explicitly about that. But I would almost obsessively revisit my reasons for quitting running and scrutinize them and say, \u201cWas it right? What did I learn in the intervening five, ten, fifteen, twenty years about who I am, what I want, what it takes to be good at something.\u201d So that was a really valuable experience at exactly the right time because that\u2019s the age where decisions, not decisions matter, but where I think you reflect on thing in your adolescents in a way that you don\u2019t reflect on things later in life. Tim Ferriss: And what age was this or what grade? Malcolm Gladwell: I was 15. Tim Ferriss: Fifteen. I always thought I was going to go back, at some point, and be a ninth grade teacher. So right around that 14 to 16 range. It seems like there are a lot of very important forks in the road. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah, I think there is. I think you are because everything is plastic at that age. So you can mold it whatever way you want. And so it\u2019s just a kind of like I think about how confusing and complicated those years are in retrospect. Tim Ferriss: Do you have any morning routines? What does the first 60 minutes of your day look like? It could be any day of the week. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a work day. Malcolm Gladwell: Well, I was just saying earlier, I think one should eat very little in the morning. Tim Ferriss: What time do you wake up? Malcolm Gladwell: You know, 8:00. I have a big thing of tea. Tim Ferriss: What type of tea? Sorry, I\u2019m going to keep \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell: Lapsang Souchong. Tim Ferriss: Oh, that\u2019s great stuff. Malcolm Gladwell: Great stuff. Tim Ferriss: I remember a friend loved whiskey, and he felt like the smell reminded him of some type of PD alcoholic beverage. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah, it has an amazing smell. It\u2019s a very controversial tea. And then, I might have \u2013 Tim Ferriss: I\u2019m going to pull a Malcolm here. Wait, wait, wait, why is it a controversial tea? Malcolm Gladwell: Some people smell it, and they just run in the opposite direction. They don\u2019t even think it\u2019s tea. I\u2019ve never seen people have such a kind of \u2013 and there\u2019s a little coffee shop where I go often in the morning to have my tea. And they have it. I think I\u2019m one of the only people who order it. I think they get it because of me. And it\u2019s like I walk in, and they make a beeline for it. But it\u2019s clear that I\u2019m in a distinct minority. It smells. I mean, you can smell it from quite a ways off. I might eat a little bit of oatmeal. That\u2019s pretty much all I\u2019ll eat in the morning. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s one of your go to\u2019s? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. But not a lot. And then, I look at three websites. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So we\u2019re going to come back to the three websites. So not a lot means a cup full, a couple of spoons? Malcolm Gladwell: Like a cup full, half a cup, something like that. Just enough that I have something in my stomach. And then, I will look at three websites. The first one is Let\u2019s Run.com. All serious runners read Let\u2019s Run. Then, I read Marginal Revolution, Tara Cohen\u2019s column. And then, I read ESPN.com just to make sure nothing major happened in the world of sports. And then, I start my work. Tim Ferriss: And what time is that then when you\u2019re starting your work? Malcolm Gladwell: So we\u2019re still before 9:00. And then, if I have writing to do, it\u2019s best to do it in the two hours that follow. Tim Ferriss: So before lunch. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And what does your routine look like in those few hours when you start your work? What does that look like? Is there particular music you listen to? Malcolm Gladwell: Sitting in a coffee shop. Tim Ferriss: Sitting in a coffee shop. Malcolm Gladwell: Or some restaurant. I\u2019m not at home. And I\u2019m not in the office. And I\u2019m working pretty steadily. I\u2019m not really easily distractible. Then, around 11:30 or so, I kind of have to do other things. I mean, I don\u2019t stop working, but I stop writing. Tim Ferriss: Do you listen to music when you write? Do you just take in the ambiance? Malcolm Gladwell: If there\u2019s music on in the \u2013 I write almost entirely in public places. So I don\u2019t listen to music myself. Tim Ferriss: No headphones. Malcolm Gladwell: But I like the noise because I came of age in a newsroom. So I need that. I mean, I learned how to write in the middle of when newsrooms, they\u2019re not noisy now, they used to be incredibly loud.\u00a0So that\u2019s what I need to kind of get going. Tim Ferriss: And then, is that when the bulk of your writing is done is that pre-lunch period? Or do you write in the afternoons and evenings? Malcolm Gladwell: No, I rarely write in the afternoon. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Journalists seem to be very adaptable, or former journalists, people who have worked in newspapers or have had those types of daily deadlines. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah, we\u2019re faster. And also, remember, writing is not the time consuming part. It\u2019s knowing what to write. It\u2019s the thinking and the arranging and the interviewing and the researching and the organizing. That\u2019s what takes time. Writing is blissful. I wish I could do it more. It\u2019s a break from all of the hassle. Tim Ferriss: Let\u2019s just say end of work day to bed, what do your wind down routines look like or pre-bed? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, I go running then probably after the end of the afternoon. And I\u2019m injured now, but that\u2019s really the highlight of the kind of work day. Some days, I\u2019ll go to train with my track club. Sometimes, I go for a long run. Or I\u2019ll go biking, or I\u2019ll go to a cross fit workout, something physical to get going. Tim Ferriss: What is your favorite movement in cross fit or exercise and the least? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, runners secretly distain any activity that is not running. Tim Ferriss: I know enough runners to know you\u2019re right. Malcolm Gladwell: So I don\u2019t even want to think about favorite in that context. It\u2019s something I suffer through because it\u2019s necessary to ward off injury. And when it\u2019s over, I\u2019m very happy. But I\u2019m much happier if I can go and run 8 miles with some friends. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Pre-bed, anything in particular? Malcolm Gladwell: No. I\u2019ll eat dinner. I might read in the evening. I watch sports or TV. Tim Ferriss: Do you have trouble getting to sleep, or do you generally sleep easily? Malcolm Gladwell: I come from a family of we are champion sleepers. Gladwells, we\u2019re epic. Tim Ferriss: Some of the best sleepers out there? Malcolm Gladwell: We are some of the best. It is our defining characteristic. Our definition of a bad night of sleep is so hilarious because it\u2019s like my father will say he had trouble sleeping. And what that means is he was up for 20 minutes between 4:00 and 4:20. That\u2019s a bad night of sleep. Tim Ferriss: So if the Gladwells are heading up the leader board in sleep, what are you guys not good at, or you personally? Malcolm Gladwell: What are we not good at? Tim Ferriss: What do you find challenging? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, we\u2019re not great talkers. We\u2019re all pretty introverted, with the exception of my brother who makes up for it. We\u2019re not terribly adventurous. I mean, we\u2019re adventurous in certain very, very specific ways. But I didn\u2019t grow up going \u2013 we would go on family vacations to either England or Jamaica where both of my parents are from. My father would travel a lot to interesting places. But we never went out to eat or went to the movies or went to concerts. The sort of going out thing was not something we did. I would go entire summers when I, basically, never left the house. So we didn\u2019t explore our immediate surroundings in a way that we might have. Tim Ferriss: What is an example of the worst advice that you hear being dispensed or given? It could be related to anything, writing, running, doesn\u2019t matter. Malcolm Gladwell: The worst advice that, in general, we give in America is that we terrify high school kids about their college choices. All things related to college fall under the category of bad advice. As you will find out when you listen to my rants about college on this podcast, I think the America college system needs to be blown up and they need to start over. To my mind, you could not have conceived of a worse system. So any advice that has to do with you need to work hard and get into the best college you can, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just bullshit. It\u2019s just terrible. You should not try to go to the best college you can, particularly if best is defined by US News and World Report. The sole test of what a good college is is it a place where I find myself late at night having deeply interesting conversations with people that I like and find interesting? You go where you can do that. That\u2019s all that matters. So am I so inspired by what I learned during the day that I want to be talking about it at 1:00 in the morning? And do I have someone who will have that conversation with me and will challenge me? That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it. Everything else is nonsense. So you tell me what that place is. Now, so that place could be any number of 1,000 places in the world. Maybe even that place is unpredictable. Maybe it is that what matters is not that some schools can provide that experience and some can\u2019t. What matters is what happens when I go to that school. Do I create that experience for myself? And I think that experience could be created at almost any institution in the country. There are interesting kids everywhere. And it\u2019s only in our snobbery that we have decided that interestingness is defined by your test scores. This is just such an outrageous lie. Test scores, sure they matter in some way, but I\u2019m talking about college now. What makes for a powerful college experience is can I find someone interesting to have an interesting discussion with? And you can do that if you\u2019re curious and you\u2019re interesting. That\u2019s it.\u00a0Not that you\u2019re interesting, you\u2019re interested. That\u2019s all that matters. Tim Ferriss: Which comes back to the questions, having the ability and the ammo to ask good questions and follow up questions. Malcolm Gladwell: By the way, some of the people that you learn most from in those settings are some of the most flawed people. It\u2019s not true that you learn the most from the smartest, most put together people. I think about my college experience, the people who had a lasting impact on me were deeply, deeply flawed people. And their flaws were what almost drew me to them and what I kind of fixated on and found fascinating. I had a friend, still one of my very best friends, ended up being very, very successful. In college, he was a basket case, complete basket case to the point where he literally said this to me once. I said, \u201cWhy do you have a library book that\u2019s three months overdue? Your fine is going up every day.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid to take it back because I can\u2019t afford the fine.\u201d He said this to me. And simultaneously, he actually turned out to be a brilliant student or a brilliant professional. And just squaring those two sides to his personality, the idea that he was hapless in some really crucial respects, and, yet, made an incredibly successful place for himself in the world. Figuring that contradiction out took years. And when I did kind of figure it out, it so enhanced my understanding of people and the world and just understanding the ways that he compensated for his haplessness brilliantly. And also, realizing that if you\u2019re hapless in that kind of logistical sense, common sense sense, he has no common sense, if you\u2019re thoughtful about it, it won\u2019t matter one iota. Tim Ferriss: What flaws or weaknesses do you have that have turned out to be strengths in some capacity? Malcolm Gladwell: This is like a job interview question, isn\u2019t it? Tim Ferriss: I was going to offer you a position at Tim Ferriss Enterprises, but I think you\u2019re too busy. Malcolm Gladwell: Well, probably, God \u2013 Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s only a job interview if you say sometimes I just work too hard. Malcolm Gladwell: Exactly. In dealing with my own impatience and my sloppiness and to attending to those flaws, I think that\u2019s been a really crucial thing in helping me achieve what I\u2019ve achieved. So it\u2019s just \u2013 Tim Ferriss: Can you elaborate on that? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m sloppy. Tim Ferriss: In what sense? Sloppy like clothes all over the floor or \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell: No, no, no. Sloppy about I\u2019m in a hurry, I don\u2019t always double check something I know. Or I\u2019ll interview someone for 45 minutes when I should interview them for 2 hours. I\u2019m just kind of like I\u2019m a good enough person. I\u2019m not a perfectionist. It\u2019s fine. And so I\u2019ve become so aware of that now that I\u2019ve compensated. And I have taught myself to be a lot more of a perfectionist, or I\u2019ve forced myself to keep asking questions much longer than I would have. When I said earlier that it was these investments of time that have been so \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019ve forced myself to invest more time in a lot of activities knowing that, if I did it my normal way, I\u2019d be out the door. I\u2019d be thinking about what I want for dinner as opposed to \u2013 so that\u2019s sort of a very \u2013 it\u2019s why, by the way, I so object to when you observe or measure someone\u2019s natural inclinations, you haven\u2019t got a picture of them because you don\u2019t know what they do with those natural inclinations. So it turns out that one of the most important things about me is how obsessed I am with those two flaws of mine. So identifying those as my natural inclinations tells you exactly the opposite about me. Tim Ferriss: Because you\u2019re compensating by developing the opposite. Malcolm Gladwell: I am massively compensating for them all day long. I\u2019m obsessed with compensating for them. Tim Ferriss: Have you received a lot of bad advice along the way as to what you might do professionally? Or has that not been the case? Malcolm Gladwell: No. I mean, I\u2019m not an advice seeker about those kinds of things nor much of an advice giver. So I haven\u2019t really gotten a lot of \u2013 and also, my position is you can\u2019t know. I\u2019ve kind of stumbled into most of the things I\u2019ve been doing. I much prefer just simply to be open to opportunity than to plan my path. I think that\u2019s better, for me anyway. I don\u2019t know. People are different. So some people need to plan. But I don\u2019t think ahead really at all. Tim Ferriss: Your comment about the compensation and just that last mile, so to speak, with the interviews and so on reminds me of Laird Hamilton, the surfer. He was trying to teach me, he had a lot of patience, how to surf at one point a few years ago. And he said, \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve caught a wave, paddle again because, if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s like that last paddle when you think you\u2019re there, you\u2019re just not going to catch the wave.\u201d When you think of the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind and why? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, I\u2019m so deeply obsessed with running these days that I immediately think of runners. Tim Ferriss: That\u2019s fine. Malcolm Gladwell: There\u2019s an American runner, Gaylin Rupp, who is maybe our silver medalist in the London games in the 10,000. And I really admire him for many reasons. He\u2019s, first of all, a system runner. That is to say he was sort of identified in high school as being someone of promise. He\u2019s been with the same coach ever since. And he had a very thoughtful training path and career path. Tim Ferriss: What was his name again? Malcolm Gladwell: Gaylin Rupp. And he\u2019s also a very beautiful runner. Both of those things matter to me. Tim Ferriss: What makes a beautiful runner? Is it gait? Malcolm Gladwell: If you looked him up on the internet, and you looked at the way he moved, you would say he\u2019s like a ballet dancer. He just has grace. There are ugly runners, and there are beautiful runners. He\u2019s a beautiful runner. Those two things in combination and the idea that he, on an esthetic level, are deeply pleasing. So he does the thing that he wants to do not just successfully by the standard metric, he runs very quickly, he wins races, but also by a purely irrelevant esthetic metric. He creates beauty as he\u2019s doing it. That matters to me. And it matters to me that he\u2019s so thoughtful, purposeful in his, to use that phrase, in his preparation that it\u2019s not happenstance or that he\u2019s sort of thought about what does it mean for me, Gaylin Rupp, to bring out the best in myself. And running is tricky because running is all about restraint, even, especially, at the elite level. You can\u2019t be obsessive or a perfectionist and succeed as a runner. You\u2019ll get injured. Running is all about good enough. Tim Ferriss: Because you will have too much training volume? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. You\u2019re walking this fine line between adequately preparing yourself for racing and overtraining, which leads to injury and burn out and all of these kinds of things. And the whole struggle in running is to not get injured, to not cross that line. And so in order to not cross that line, you have to rein in all of these tendencies. Your obsessiveness, you want to do the tenth repetition. You\u2019re doing 10 times of whatever, half miles. And you know, logically, that after nine, that\u2019s enough. You\u2019ve pushed your body as far as it can go. But your kind of anal disciplined self says no, do 10 because 10 was the workout. You can\u2019t do 10. You have to be tough enough to say no, no, no, I\u2019ve done enough for the day and walk away. Do you know how hard that is? Particularly for the kinds of personalities that are attracted to elite running. It\u2019s insane. That kind of notion of how hard it is to say it\u2019s good enough and walk away. It\u2019s like he does that. Tim Ferriss: So a couple of things. It makes me think about a story I heard related to Charlie Francis, a very controversial sprint coach, Ben Johnson and so on. The reality is he was a brilliant coach. And I hate to say it, but I\u2019m not going to point fingers at any specific people, but very likely that all of the top sprinters at that level are using something besides Spiralina. Malcolm Gladwell: Were. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s still true, but go on. In that era, in Charlie Francis\u2019s era, absolutely, yeah. Tim Ferriss: That was kind of the golden age of doping in a sense, but the athletes always have more resources than the [inaudible] in terms of testing and that cat and mouse game. But some really interesting things that have come out just recently. I\u2019ll give an example. So there was a period of time where the vast majority of world championship or Olympic sprinters had prescriptions due to their narcolepsy because they wanted to take Modafinil as a stimulant pre-race. But I digress. But what Charlie said was, in the case of an elite sprinter, someone said how do you push your athletes. And he said, \u201cNo, no, no, the last thing I need to do is push my athletes. It\u2019s my job to rein them in. I always have to rein them in.\u201d And he would have to say no, Charlie, you can\u2019t do two sets of squats with 600 pounds on your back at 160 or whatever it was. You have to do one set and so on. But I wanted to come back to plan. So you said you\u2019re not much for plans, but you are one for systems. So it made me think of, it seems, at least in the case of running, it made me think of, and I\u2019m going to paraphrase here, there\u2019s a quote from I want to say Jeff Bazo something along the lines of we\u2019re uncompromising on the vision and flexible on the details. Where do you have systems in your life that you rely on? Malcolm Gladwell: I wish I had more systems sometimes. I don\u2019t really have a lot of \u2013 I mean, because now, I\u2019m essentially self employed and don\u2019t go \u2013 I mean, I have discipline, personal discipline. But is it that rigid? Part of the reason I say I think Gaylin Rupp is successful is because I\u2019m a little bit envious of the system and structure that he has in place. And it\u2019s occurred to me how much can be achieved when you\u2019re that kind of thoughtful about what you\u2019re doing. As someone who is as obsessed with sports as I am, the thing that always breaks your heart is someone who leaves potential on the table. And I don\u2019t think Gaylin Rupp has. And that is an extraordinary achievement. To be able to say when he retires, \u201cI ran as fast as I could possibly have run,\u201d that is more important than to say I won a gold medal or I set a world record. And I don\u2019t mean that in a kind of cheesy \u2013 I really mean that. To say I got at 99 percent of my ability is huge. Tim Ferriss: And I think folks would be surprised, and you\u2019ve probably interacted with many more elite runners than I have, but I\u2019ve met people, a few of them, and I\u2019ve also interacted with coaches and physical therapists who have worked with people like Jackie Joyner-Kersee. And it\u2019s very common that they would say, about that level of athlete, they\u2019ve never let it all go and really given 100 percent because of whether it\u2019s fear of a hamstring tear, fear of X, fear of Y, Z, whatever it might be. So the fact that this runner is leaving it all on the track \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. So it\u2019s interesting. We\u2019ve been talking. There are two necessarily contradictory things here with runners, which is training is about restraint but racing is not. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re still getting at the psychology of these elite athletes is so complex. Restrain, restrain, restrain in preparation. Get on the track and, all of a sudden, no, no more restraint. Go. Tim Ferriss: All of that behavior you\u2019ve been conditioning, no, ignore all that. Malcolm Gladwell: And as I returned to running quite recently and running in a serious way, and that\u2019s the piece of it that\u2019s proving really hard for me to grasp is that idea of turning it on on race day. So I train very well. And I race less well and for that very reason. Whereas I look around me, really elite runners, the difference between their training and racing is astounding like they\u2019re just different animals. It\u2019s fascinating to see that. Tim Ferriss: What books, besides your own, have you gifted to other people the most? Malcolm Gladwell: There\u2019s one book I\u2019ve given the most in my life, which is a book called \u2013 well, there are several now that I think about it. There\u2019s a book by Timothy Wilson called Strangers to Ourselves, which is one of the loveliest, most insightful books about social psychology that I ever read. And I give that a lot to people. And every time I meet, and really, I\u2019m always meeting people who work in retail, particularly I always send them, particularly if they\u2019re Jewish, I send them a book called The Merchant Princes. It\u2019s a book about the great Jewish retail families of America. So in the 19th century, all of these people come over from Europe who have experience in the garment trade or retailing. And an extraordinary number of the early 20th century/late 19th century department stores pop up around America are founded by Jewish immigrants from Europe from, literally, you go to any town in America, the traditional department store is from one of those families. Well, a guy, and I\u2019ve forgotten his name, wrote a book about those families, and it\u2019s called The Merchant Princes, and it\u2019s fantastic. Tim Ferriss: Oh, princes plural, okay. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes, it\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s about everything I\u2019m interested in. It\u2019s about immigrants. It\u2019s about people figuring out and then conquering an unfamiliar marketplace. It\u2019s about all of the brilliant ideas that came to these guys as they invented the department store. The ideas that, by the way, all of these internet retailers, they\u2019re just grandchildren of these guys. I mean, there\u2019s nothing dramatically new has happened. They worked it all out 100 years ago. I mean, it really humbles you about the so-called retail revolution of the last 10 years. And they\u2019re such extraordinary characters. And I love the way their personality is kind of imprinted on their business. So there\u2019s a fantastic chapter about Filenes, the Filene brothers who start Filene\u2019s in Boston. Tim Ferriss: Which they have Filene\u2019s Basement and so on. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. And they invent these incredibly interesting ideas about how to hold a sale, how to use people\u2019s psychological impulses to generate the desire to buy. These guys are so far ahead of everybody else. It\u2019s like 100 years ago, and they are on another level. Just like it\u2019s one story like that after another. It\u2019s a brilliant book. Tim Ferriss: Do you read any fiction? Malcolm Gladwell: Oh, huge amounts. I read spy novels. Tim Ferriss: Spy novels. Malcolm Gladwell: If it has the word spy in it, I\u2019ve read it. Tim Ferriss: So for someone who is unfamiliar with the genre, but excited to get started, where should they start? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, I mean, how many hours do we have? But if you know nothing about it, you should start with John Le Carre, of course, and read his first five books. So I would read at least through Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. And you could keep going. You should read through Little Drummer\u2019s Girl or even Russia House. I like his later stuff less so. But it\u2019s still fantastic. But you must read Spy Came in from the Cold. I mean, that\u2019s just kind of like gold standard. Tim Ferriss: A given. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. And then, I read all of Lee Child\u2019s books. They\u2019re not spy thrillers, per se, but they\u2019re thrillers. Those are fantastic. I have hundreds. I have literally hundreds of spy novels in my house. Tim Ferriss: What $100.00 or less purchase, this is ballpark, meaning not a Bugatti or something, that has most positively impacted your life that comes to mind? Malcolm Gladwell: Probably a piece of music. I think it was probably an album by Brian Eno called Another Green World, which is one of his early \u201870s, it\u2019s ambient music, but not the kind of really weird ambient music. There\u2019s an adage that says the music you discover when you are 18, I think it\u2019s 18 is the magic year, is the music that stays with you for the rest of your life. Well, I discovered that when I was 18. And I sing the songs of that album in my head all of the time. And I worship Brian Eno. Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s a fascinating guy. Malcolm Gladwell: Have you interviewed him? Tim Ferriss: I haven\u2019t. I would enjoy it though. I have a collection of cards that he also put out called Oblique Strategies. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes, I know about those. Tim Ferriss: And I have it right on top of there\u2019s another one called The Whack Pack, which is a series of odd questions just intended to help you. Malcolm Gladwell: He\u2019s genius. He\u2019s also the most articulate person I\u2019ve ever met. Tim Ferriss: Wow. I should try to get Mr. Eno on the podcast. Malcolm Gladwell: You should because just to listen to him talk, it\u2019s distracting how perfectly he talks. Tim Ferriss: He\u2019s one of those. Malcolm Gladwell: You just want to listen because it\u2019s perfectly done paragraphs. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s ready for publication. Malcolm Gladwell: I mean, I can\u2019t explain the experience. It\u2019s just kind of awe inspiring. Tim Ferriss: I\u2019ve had that experience when watching Neil Gaiman speak or listening to him speak and also perform. It\u2019s just incredible. What is something you believe that other people think is crazy? Or something that a lot of people believe that you think is crazy, aside from the college piece? Either one, but I\u2019m most interested in things that you believe that other people would raise an eyebrow to. Malcolm Gladwell: I think I believe in ghosts. Tim Ferriss: I like this. All right. Tell me more. Malcolm Gladwell: I just do. I don\u2019t understand. My aunt who lives in Jamaica used to live in this house called Hilson Hale, which was said to be haunted. There was a particular room that was said to be haunted. And so I slept in the room. I was a kid. I was 13 or 14. And it was haunted. I saw a ghost in there. It played the guitar in the middle of the night. I don\u2019t know. And at that age, in Jamaica, everyone believes in ghosts. Not everyone, but people believe in ghosts. So do I think the house is haunted? I actually do think it\u2019s haunted. And I also don\u2019t understand if you believe in God, as I do, it\u2019s not that hard to believe in ghosts. So I believe in the existence of things outside of my own, direct, physical experience. And also, I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s controversial. Why people think that you can only believe in things that we have conventional explanations for and that you can see and touch. Well, that strikes me as being \u2013 why would you limit yourself like that? I mean, I\u2019m not crazy. I don\u2019t believe in UFO\u2019s, although, I don\u2019t rule them out. I\u2019m not a kind of spiritualist. But, in a kind of purely rational way, I believe there is stuff out there that can\u2019t be properly explained. Why? Because why would we have explanations for everything. Tim Ferriss: Or not yet. Malcolm Gladwell: Or not yet. There\u2019s a ways to go. Tim Ferriss: Just because there are phenomena that we can\u2019t currently explain or examine using the scientific method, which is sometimes poorly and sometimes properly implement, it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t. And you just have to look back in the history books to see many, many, many examples of this. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. My other is identical twin. And if you know an identical twin, you witness that they live \u2013 one lives in Jamaica, one is in Canada. And they do that thing that twins do, which is they call each other and say I was so worried about you. And then, the other one will say I just had some kind of accident. Or one will say I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible pain in my stomach, and my mother is like that\u2019s because I just had an operation for \u2013 that kind of stuff, which is that weird thing you read about. And it happens. I don\u2019t know. Tim Ferriss: This is the second time this has come up on this podcast. I had an identical twin on my podcast, and we talked about this. Malcolm Gladwell: So do I have a rational explanation for that? Does my mother? No. Is it maybe a coincidence? I don\u2019t know. Maybe. It just needs explanation. I don\u2019t have one. But I\u2019m open to things that don\u2019t have an explanation. Tim Ferriss: So the question what is something you believe that other people think is insane is actually modified and kind of paraphrased wording of a question that Peter Teal likes to ask I suppose when he\u2019s interviewing founders. What is your opinion of Peter Teal, if you have one? Malcolm Gladwell: All I know about him is what I know from this whole [inaudible] thing. I know he\u2019s been a bad odor among some people. And I never read his book, but I think he might have taken a shot at me. I don\u2019t remember this. Tim Ferriss: So the Zero to One, he takes issue with how he interprets your position as it relates to success and circumstantial factors or luck. Malcolm Gladwell: Oh. Does he think there\u2019s more \u2013 he\u2019s more up to the individual.\nTim Ferriss: That would be his position. Malcolm Gladwell: Oh, I see. That\u2019s a reasonable position. Tim Ferriss: I mean, the irony, in part, and one of my fans pointed this out, is that he talks in the very beginning of the book how failing to get, by a string of events outside of his control, failing to get a clerkship led to all of these other things that wouldn\u2019t have happened had he received the clerkship. Malcolm Gladwell: There we go. Tim Ferriss: Are there any, and I\u2019m going to word this broadly, innovators \u2013 and that\u2019s sort of jumping, I live in Silicon Valley. A lot of real innovators and even more people who like to fashion themselves as innovators, are there any people do you think that are engaged in very interesting innovation at the moment? Malcolm Gladwell: Oh, wow. Obviously, so many people. And most of the people doing the interesting stuff, we wouldn\u2019t even know about, would we? They would have told us. Tim Ferriss: Don\u2019t have publicists? Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. I don\u2019t know if I have a good answer to that. Tim Ferriss: We could also take a retrospective because everything that was old is once new again, in terms of the retail. So are there other examples of innovators that you\u2019ve become fascinated by? For instance, I interviewed Marc Andreessen recently, an incredible tech icon, fascinating guy. And he looks to people like Walt Disney and Edison to apply lessons that they learned and habits they developed, rules they developed for themselves, too. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. I guess I would say my New Yorker colleague, Atul Gawande has done all of this work with checklists. Tim Ferriss: Such great stuff. Malcolm Gladwell: Fantastic stuff. And I really admire him because it\u2019s deeply unpopular work within his own profession. But it\u2019s work that has extraordinary potential for saving lives. And it\u2019s one of those things that, ultimately, has far more usefulness in the developing world than the developed world. Tim Ferriss: I mean, the line infection example and the checklist manifesto is just staggering. Malcolm Gladwell: But he took an extraordinary risk to his own reputation domestically in America in the medical profession by doing that. Doctors do not like checklists. And they think of him as simplifying, dumbing down, they have all of these kind of epithets they use against him unfairly, I think, because he\u2019s not saying all medicine can be reduced to a checklist. He\u2019s saying let\u2019s find the parts that can be and do it that way. So I admire the idea. But, almost more, I admire the kind of guts that made the idea possible. Tim Ferriss: So there are a number of books, about 20 or 30, that I have in my living room because I spend a lot of time there writing, often times, although, I do like to get out to a third location of some sense. I\u2019ll go stir crazy. But I have I\u2019d say about 10 books that are face out to remind me of certain things or to elicit certain emotions. And the Checklist Manifesto is one of them. Malcolm Gladwell: Oh, yeah. He\u2019d be pleased to hear that. The other thing, by the way, tons and tons of people write interesting things. Atul then went and put his ideas into action on a grand scale throughout the world. Follow through, so he\u2019s not this kind of intellectual holding forth. He has the idea. He takes the heat. And then, he makes it happen in a real way around the world. I mean, it\u2019s extraordinary. Tim Ferriss: Very commendable. What advice would you give to your \u2013 actually, before we get to that one, we talked about books. Do you have any favorite movies or documentaries that you\u2019ve seen multiple times? Malcolm Gladwell: No. I\u2019m not really a movie or a documentary guy. Tim Ferriss: All right. Then, that\u2019s an easy pass to the advice you would give your 30-year-old self. Malcolm Gladwell: I would have left North America. Leave North America. Get out of there. Tim Ferriss: Why? Malcolm Gladwell: Because you\u2019ll wake up when you\u2019re 50 and realize that you spent your entire working career in North America, which is, despite the fact that it pretends to be the only place that matters, is not the only place that matters. I would have been so much more interesting and thoughtful and insightful and whatever if I had experienced, particularly in the developing world. I had an idea when I was in my 20\u2019s that I wanted to go and study in Jamaica, a place where I have family and I have some familiarity with it. I should have done it or some similar kind of thing. I just think it\u2019s always my advice to young people, which is, particularly young people of privilege, is just leave. Go away. You can come back, but you can\u2019t stay in the cocoon your whole life. It will limit you in ways you cannot even begin to understand at this point. Tim Ferriss: I totally agree. I was chatting with Sebastian Junger about \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell: Oh, he got out of the bubble. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Malcolm Gladwell: Repeatedly. Tim Ferriss: About the system and also any potential remedies. And he felt a mandatory year of, in his case, national service, but it could be volunteering with the Peace Corps after I think it was high school and spending a year exposing yourself to those types of environments before going into the \u201creal world\u201d somewhere. In this case, North America. Malcolm Gladwell: Two of the religious groups who take a lot of heat but for whom I have enormous respect, the Mennonites and the Mormons, have an institutionalized practice of sending people to other cultures. Tim Ferriss: Their mission. Malcolm Gladwell: The mission. And people who go on those missions come back transformed. Not just spiritually, but they have seen a side \u2013 and by the way, they\u2019re not going as American college students do when they do the year abroad to Florence. Going to Florence does not expand your horizons. Don\u2019t do a year abroad in Paris. That notion that I\u2019m going to break out of the box and go and spend six months in the [inaudible]. Bullshit. Go somewhere real.\u00a0That\u2019s the upside of that kind of experience. Tim Ferriss: When people have the means, I spent a year in Japan as an exchange student at 15. It was my first real time out of the United States. And it completely rocked my world. It called everything into question. And so when people have the chance, they\u2019re like well, I\u2019m thinking about going here, here, here, and if Japan is on the list, I always respond with, \u201cGo to Japan because it will make no sense. You won\u2019t be able to read anything. And the English that you do read won\u2019t make any sense. People do not speak English well. And you should just walk until you get lost. And then, try to find your way back because it\u2019s safe. You won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d Malcolm Gladwell: I went there for the first time two months ago. Tim Ferriss: Oh, really? Malcolm Gladwell: Blew my mind. It was like, oh, my God, it\u2019s so interesting. Tim Ferriss: Any favorite moments or frames? Malcolm Gladwell: I was there so briefly. I had to come back, sadly, because I was working on this podcast. But I was there for like four days. I just walked around. I did what I had to do, and then, I just went for this \u2013 I remember once, I was walking down a perfectly ordinary, random, residential street. I was thirsty. I saw a tiny sign called Coffee. So I look. Is there a coffee shop? Can\u2019t find it. Search. Finally have to go down some stairs, through doors, up some stairs through another door, and there\u2019s a room. And there\u2019s a young woman behind a counter. And she makes a cup of coffee that is so far and away the greatest cup of coffee I\u2019ve ever had. Nothing else is even close. And then, I tried to tip her as one would, and she got offended and threw the money back. But it was just like this impossible to find, in the middle of nowhere coffee shop that just kills any other. But that\u2019s Japan. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s like walking through a fevered dream. Japan is so much fun. So the podcast, how did you decide \u2013 no doubt you have had people propose that you do a podcast before. I mean, I still think we\u2019re at the very early stages of adoption. I think something like 15 or 17 percent of the people in the US have listened to podcasts. It\u2019s very relatively minority group at this point. Why now? What led to the decision? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, my friend, Jacob, who runs the Slate Group, an old, old friend of mine, they have Panoply is there, a big podcasting company. And he said, \u201cDo you want to do a podcast?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And he said, \u201cCome on, do a podcast.\u201d So I said, \u201cAll right.\u201d It was literally that. And then, I sort of got really into it and realized how fun it was. And for all of the reasons I talked about earlier, just how it\u2019s a different way to tell a story. Tim Ferriss: What about it has been the most fun for you? And maybe we covered it already. I mean, it is \u2013 Malcolm Gladwell: Well, one is that I\u2019d never done a group experience, group thing before. So creating in a group was super novel. I don\u2019t even go to meetings, Tim. There are no meetings in my life. And, suddenly, I went to meetings. And I didn\u2019t realize everyone hates meetings, but I was like this is exciting. So everything was just kind of like \u2013 and then, the idea of just the ability to generate emotion in a way you can\u2019t do on the page was just more than a revelation. It was kind of I was entranced by that possibility. Tim Ferriss: It\u2019s transformative. I mean, for me, this podcast started as a lark, something to do in between extremely exhausting book projects. And when people \u2013 if any fans come up to me now when I\u2019m on the street, at least 9 times out of 10, probably even a higher percentage, talk about the podcast and not the books. And, hopefully, that\u2019s not because my books are terrible. That could mean that, relatively speaking, that is the case. But I think the emotional response you\u2019re able to create and the emotional bond that is forged through the audio medium is just I have to imagine it\u2019s reflective of some hardwiring that we have as storytelling machines. Malcolm Gladwell: It\u2019s kind of an amazingly powerful thing. Tim Ferriss: Where would you, and maybe this is to be kept a secret, but where would you, in an ideal world let\u2019s say two years from now, what are you doing in audio or not? What does the podcast look like? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, I imagine I\u2019ll do another season. And I played with the idea of inviting someone to join the Revisionist History rubric and have someone else do a couple of episodes and try something similar. There\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be a kind of \u2013 if I\u2019m doing a collective project, let\u2019s really make it collective not just me dreaming up the \u2013 so I thought about that if I could find someone who took it seriously and sort of shared my \u2013 but I don\u2019t know. And then, can I make a living doing it?\u00a0That\u2019s another question. Tim Ferriss: So we can certainly talk more about the last piece offline, but I would say the answer should be yes. There\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t be. And on the second to last piece, I would absolutely encourage you to experiment with the format because it\u2019s such a lightweight, relatively speaking, medium and format for doing that. I mean, I\u2019ve tried four or five different formats. Some were complete strikeouts. And some, in terms of the cost of creation, in terms of energy, time, money, etc., to the output and impact on listeners was so disproportionately favorable, it was like wow, I\u2019m really glad I tried those five because these didn\u2019t work. But these solo Q&A\u2019s that I do sometimes as Round 2\u2019s with guests started off because, if you want to talk about kind of, I was sick at the time I did the Peter Teal interview. And so it ended up being this solo read of sorts, which was profound and hilarious and great in a bunch of different ways. And I realized, wait a second, I don\u2019t actually have to be there for this to be useful to listeners. And so I hope you experiment with that. Last real question, and then, we\u2019ll wrap up here. If you had a billboard and could put anything on it, what would you put on that billboard? Malcolm Gladwell: Probably a picture of one of my favorite runners. On my phone, I\u2019ll show you what\u2019s on my phone. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Malcolm Gladwell: He\u2019s obscured by all of the \u2013 Tim Ferriss: All of the icons, but who is that? Malcolm Gladwell: Asbel Kiprop, the world\u2019s greatest miler. Tim Ferriss: From Kenya. Malcolm Gladwell: He\u2019s my screen saver, my picture on my phone. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m obsessed with the idea that track and field ought to be one of our most popular sports and, in fact, is our least popular sport. So I would love to \u2013 I want a day when the American record holder in the 5K can walk down the street, and everyone will come up to her and say wow, can I have your autograph?\u00a0And she\u2019ll be mobbed. And that\u2019s what I want to happen one day. Tim Ferriss: This could seem like a silly question. But do you have any quotes that you live your life by or mantras, in a non woo-woo kind of sense that are meaningful to you? They might just be [inaudible] rules of thumb, anything like that? Malcolm Gladwell: Not really. Kind of in a playful way, I keep finding myself coming back to the legal adage difficult cases make bad law, which I think is an incredibly insightful comment because we\u2019re drawn to the difficult case. We shouldn\u2019t generalize from it. And that\u2019s this problem we run into in the political realm over and over again. Not just the political realm, many realms. Tim Ferriss: Can you give an example of that? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m clear. Malcolm Gladwell: Yeah. So 9/11, it\u2019s a difficult case, right? Incredibly rare, catastrophic event, catches us by surprise. Should you try to generate policy exclusively from the 9/11 experience? That\u2019s what we did. And what did we do? I think we made a bunch of really terrible mistakes. We spent $2 trillion on a war that went nowhere and made the world worse off. We subverted our own civil liberties. We created these monolithic government agencies that God knows what they\u2019re doing. Are we actually safer than we were? I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s a case where, if we had exercised some restraint and say, you know what, you can\u2019t use a single incident, which was this bizarre outlier, and base the whole national security policy of your country on it. You have to look at the long view, take the long view. Obama is a very natural \u2013 that kind of thinking is very natural to him. He\u2019s difficult cases of bad law kind of guy. He\u2019s like let\u2019s not overreact. Let\u2019s wait and see, that kind of thing, which people find very frustrating with him. But I like that notion. Similarly, it\u2019s about not overreacting to black swans, to outlying events, and also, choosing your case studies wisely. That\u2019s what I think it\u2019s really about. Tim Ferriss: And I suppose you could also generalize it to your personal life in many ways, too. Just because you\u2019re mugged once doesn\u2019t mean you should have a fundamental distrust of every human being as you go throughout life. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes, exactly right. And I think we can go further that just because you have been traumatized in some way doesn\u2019t mean you are permanently scarred. Human beings are resilient. They recover. Tim Ferriss: And that\u2019s something that Sebastian also brought up, and not everyone shares this opinion. But given his extensive experience with vets and soldiers, he felt like they should not be treated like victims when they come back if they suffer from PTSD for a whole host of reasons that I won\u2019t get into. But this has been so much fun. I really think we could continue talking for hours. But I want to be respectful of your time. Malcolm, where can people find the podcast, where can they find you on social media or elsewhere? Where would you like them to check things out? Malcolm Gladwell: The podcast is Revisionisthistory.com. But anywhere there are podcasts, you can find Revisionist History. And my Twitter handle is just @gladwell. I\u2019m the only Gladwell out there. But I\u2019m an indifferent tweeter, but I get into little moments when I go off. Tim Ferriss: Especially if someone brings up the myths and policies of current higher education in the United States. Malcolm Gladwell: Oh, that gets me going. Tim Ferriss: I remember Po Bronson told me once, I asked at a Q&A, and this is before I had written any books, and I asked him what he does when he has writer block. And he said, \u201cI write about what makes me angry.\u201d And, occasionally, I use that. It seems to work pretty well, at least to get me started. Malcolm, thank you so much for the time. I really appreciate it. Malcolm Gladwell: Thank you, Tim. That was really fun. Tim Ferriss: And I can\u2019t wait to jump into the episodes you mentioned of the podcast. And I\u2019ll probably just go from start to finish. I can be pretty linear that way. And to everybody listening, you can find links to Revisionist History, to everything we discussed, the books mentioned, etc., in the show notes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. And until next time, and as always, thank you for listening.

people by time magazine", "he has explored how ideas spread, decision making, the roots of success, the advantages of disadvantages", "and in his latest podcast project, revisionist history, which i highly recommend, gladwell examines the way the passage of time changes and enlightens our understanding of the world around us", "he also revisits certain aspects of history that perhaps we should take another look at", "and in this wide ranging, in depth, in person conversation, we cover a ton, including his research and writing process, how he learned to ask good questions, favorite books, routines, habits, tools, how he pulls together seemingly unrelated stories into a cohesive theme and, eventually, a book, his obsession with running, why he eats as little as possible in the mornings,

lines, and he took off", "and i was planning to speak with you about at least one or two of those, and i thought we could start with writing", "okay", "what have been the easiest and hardest books for you to write", "well, that\u2019s an interesting question", "i don\u2019t find writing \u2013 or to the extent that i find writing, i link hard and fun", "so if it\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s not fun", "so i never think about writing in terms of hard and easy", "i think about it in terms of fun and not fun", "so which one was the most fun", "probably the last two, mostly because i wrote the first book while i was still working pretty much full time at the new yorker", "so i just didn\u2019t have a lot of time", "and that makes it less fun", "you can\u2019t really savor and appreciate it", "but the last two, i took as much time as i needed and, deliberately, dragged it out because i was enjoying myself so much", "so i think probably the last two books were the \u2013 so does that mean the last two were the hardest", "the hardest/most fun", "yes, i think they were because i was trying to tell better stories", "i became convinced, about 15 years ago or so, if i was to develop as a writer, i had to be a better story teller", "and so outliers and what the dog saw were books where i was really, really trying to do a better job", "and sorry, david and goliath", "i was really trying to do a better job of telling good stories", "are there any people who come to mind, fictional or otherwise, who are good storytellers", "yeah", "michael louis is the gold standard", "and it was actually in reading michael louis that i realized that i wanted to be \u2013 you can\u2019t be him any more than you can \u2013 you can\u2019t say i watch jeff curry play basketball, and i decided that\u2019s the kind of basketball player i want to be", "you can be inspired by him", "you could pattern your play after him", "but you can\u2019t be him", "that\u2019s impossible", "so i was inspired by michael louis to get better, but i am not on his level", "i think both of you are very, very good at taking what could be dense, impenetrable material or overwhelming material and making it a story that is easy to consume as storytelling and consuming machines", "i tell a million stories in one book", "he tells one story", "that\u2019s so much harder", "what makes that harder", "because you have to go to a level of complexity and have confidence", "what happens is that i lose confidence", "and the reason that i tell lots of stories is that i don\u2019t have the confidence to keep going with the same one", "i think everyone must be losing interest", "i\u2019ve got to switch and do something else now", "michael doesn\u2019t have that problem", "he has the kind of panache to say i\u2019m going to tell you a story about a guy, basically, trying to take on the high speed traders", "and we\u2019re going to do this for 200 pages, and you\u2019re going to love it", "i can\u2019t start with that", "that\u2019s part of the reason i also write my books in, and i\u2019m not in any way comparing myself to you or \u2013 you have every right to, tim", "well, i\u2019m a teacher who dabbles in writing and sometimes puts stuff down that\u2019s intelligible", "but the way that i tend to nonlinearly write my books and encourage people to consume it in a nonlinear way is precisely for that reason because i work that if, in some cases, i can keep something interesting for 15 or 20 pages", "but i lack the confidence that i can do it for 200 or 300", "yeah", "you\u2019ve got to be good to pull off that feat, particularly with the sorts of topics that he chooses, which are esoteric", "he wrote a gripping thriller about credit swaps and derivatives", "i mean, that\u2019s not easy", "not easy at all", "i mean, then you have saver metrics", "and he\u2019s so consistent", "the next question i wanted to ask was related to, it\u2019s a perennial topic, of course, but writers\u2019 block or anything that you might consider something like that", "and it\u2019s related to the kind of module, choose your own adventure like way in which i write myself, which is one way that i can put something on the shelf if i\u2019m having trouble with it and move on to something else", "it doesn\u2019t have to be sequential", "do you run into writers\u2019 block", "if so, how does that manifest, and what do you do", "or do you get stuck", "well, i worked for 10 years at a newspaper", "and if that experience teaches you anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t have writers\u2019 block", "i mean, you quite literally can\u2019t", "you\u2019ll start the story at 10:30, and it\u2019s due at 4:00 or 4:30 or whatever", "back in those days, there were hard deadlines", "so you can\u2019t have it", "it\u2019s unthinkable", "you don\u2019t have the luxury", "and if you went to your bosses, and you said, \u201ci\u2019m blocked on this story,\u201d they would look at you like you were insane", "take off your beret, put down your poetry, you have a job to do", "so it\u2019s like there\u2019s not even an issue", "so i did used to have these issues, and then, i went to the washington post", "and you get cured in a hurry of any pretentions you have about your writing", "and you just keep typing", "there\u2019s no kind of alternative", "and luckily, i have those habits that i learned over that 10 years at the washington post have stayed with me", "and also, writing a book is maybe 20 percent writing and 80 percent organization, logistics", "so i will think about something", "for every hour i spend writing, i spend three hours thinking about writing", "so usually, when i\u2019m writing, first of all, it\u2019s a tiny period", "and secondly, it\u2019s all worked out already", "i\u2019m just putting down on the page what has already been kind of figured out in my head", "is that true also for a shorter piece in say the new yorker", "yeah", "not all of it, but i know what i\u2019m doing before i start", "or i know what the pieces are", "can you give an example of any piece or any book where it started and what the process was for you in getting to the point that you\u2019re then putting words down on paper", "and the reason i ask is that i am fascinated by structure", "i don\u2019t think i\u2019m particularly gifted at", "but i did, long ago, take a class with john mcphee, one of your colleagues, staff writer at the new yorker", "and his grasp and approach to structure is just incredible, at least the way that he visualizes his structure", "but he has a very particular process", "i can\u2019t follow his say day to day schedule, which is, basically, sitting in front of a blank piece of paper from like 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 p.m", "whether anything is written or not, which would lead me to just want to throw my head through a window", "can you give us any origin story of any book or piece", "yeah", "some were easy", "i did a story for the new yorker last fall about a school shooter in minnesota", "and that was super easy because i wanted to write about school shootings", "i started routed around on the internet, and i find this criminal complaint and transcript of an interrogation of a kid who was caught, basically, in the act, a would be school shooter caught in the act", "and it\u2019s like 60 pages", "and this absolutely extraordinary account of what he was thinking and what he was planning to do and why he was planning to do it", "and when you find something like that, i mean, your job is done", "so you\u2019re like oh, i\u2019m going to tell this story", "and then, i\u2019m going to step away only to kind of put that story in broader context", "so those are rare", "that wrote itself", "that\u2019s rare", "what are harder are things that have less obvious structure", "so my book, outliers, began with there was a chapter in that book about jewish lawyers", "about this curious fact that the group, a core group of jewish lawyers in new york city who rose to prominence in the \u201860s and \u201870s and basically kind of take over corporate law in the city, all had strikingly similar backgrounds", "and so that\u2019s the first chapter i wrote in outliers", "and that sort of is where i began that book because i met one of the \u2013 one of those lawyers was the father of a friend of mine", "i met him, and i talked to him", "i was like oh, wait a minute", "all of his buddies, they\u2019re all from the same part of the bronx", "they all were born in practically the same year", "they all went to city college", "they all went to nyu law school", "they all started in the same kind of firms", "i mean, it\u2019s the same story again and again and again", "and if you think about it, if one were, i don\u2019t know why one would, but if one were to study that book, outliers, you would discover that almost all of the themes that i explore in that book are present in the story of the jewish lawyers", "so everything is there", "so i reported that story", "i wrote that chapter", "i thought about it", "i was like oh, all of the strands that i\u2019m interested in are there", "i\u2019m going to pull out strand after strand and write chapters about them", "did it start off in your head as a chapter in a prospective book", "or was it a standalone", "no", "i wanted to write a book about successful people", "and so it was always going to be a chapter in the book", "but it was just a lucky place to start because, when you can start with one of those, i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best chapter in the book, but it is, functionally, the most important chapter in the book", "because it had all of the macro elements in the micro", "yes", "and that\u2019s the gold standard when you can begin on that kind of note", "other ones have been much more difficult because they haven\u2019t had that", "now, let\u2019s say you have that story, you have that chapter, how do you go about collecting \u2013 and let me take a step backwards", "what tools were you using to query and find this 60 page transcript of the would be school shooter", "i honestly don\u2019t remember", "i was screwing around on the internet", "i was interested in school shootings", "and i don\u2019t even know how", "there was zero coverage of this case", "it was in the local minnesota press, that\u2019s it", "i never heard of it", "the kid was caught before he did anything", "so it never made national headlines", "and the transcript is just on the website of the local da", "so it\u2019s like and i don\u2019t know how i found it", "i can\u2019t remember", "i just found it", "i\u2019d be so curious to know", "i would love to know now, too", "it was just one of those \u2013 but other cases, like in my podcast, for example, one of the episodes i like the most, two episodes actually, touch on this question", "so one is an episode, i think it\u2019s the eighth or ninth episode, it\u2019s called generous orthodoxy", "and it\u2019s the story of a 98-year-old mennonite pastor in lancaster, pennsylvania who takes on his church", "and i come from a very mennonite area in ontario", "many of my friends and brother\u2019s friends are mennonites", "my brother is a mennonite", "i know that world really well", "i go home at christmas, and everyone is talking about this guy", "and when i say everyone, the number mennonites in north america is very small", "it\u2019s a very small, evangelical, protestant sect denomination", "but they\u2019re talking about this letter this guy wrote", "it\u2019s got a lot of facebook likes for them", "and he\u2019s 98", "so i read the letter, and i\u2019m like oh, my goodness", "what an extraordinary letter", "so i track down the guy, i interview him like a week later", "i drive out to lancaster", "and i look at the transcript, and i say what\u2019s this about", "and i realize that what it\u2019s about is how to protest", "he\u2019s a guy who is so wise, and it\u2019s an extraordinary interview", "again, i did nothing", "it\u2019s one of those cases where he\u2019s just amazing", "and i stumbled into this", "it\u2019s 10:00 at night on a cold, saturday night in january", "i\u2019m in this little, tiny house on the turnpike in lancaster, pennsylvania talking to a 98-year-old guy", "and it\u2019s one of those amazing interviews where it\u2019s just all there", "i don\u2019t have to do anything", "and i\u2019m crying by the end", "it\u2019s just insane", "so i go home, and i look, and it\u2019s like i want to make a podcast about this", "and what\u2019s amazing now is i\u2019m not writing this up in print", "i\u2019m using this man\u2019s own words, which because he\u2019s so insanely moving, powerful, it\u2019s just like so much better that i can hear his voice", "and so the question is what does this story need to be finished", "not a lot", "just a little bit to put it in context", "so there\u2019s a case where you stumble across something", "and your only role is not to screw it up", "don\u2019t screw it up", "don\u2019t bury it", "just put him out there, tell the story, and then, just find some other little element that makes it clear to the listener what it\u2019s about", "that\u2019s my favorite revisionist history episode for that reason", "it\u2019s just so pure and simple", "when you have, let\u2019s say in the case of the outlier chapter on jewish lawyers, how do you capture your notes and organize your notes on something like that", "what tools do you use", "it\u2019s going to sound so old school", "i transcribe the interview, print out the transcript, and underline the parts i like", "and then, move them into a file", "and is it a word file", "what type of file is it", "i know this is getting very \u2013 it\u2019s a word file, yeah", "it\u2019s like move from one word file to the next word file", "i don\u2019t even use google docs", "i mean, i vaguely, recently got into google docs", "but i sort of feel like it doesn\u2019t really matter", "i would agree", "whether it\u2019s a pen or paint brush or crayons, you still have to know how to use the writing implement", "but the process is interesting to me", "so if you take these quotes, what qualifies, and this may seem like a sort of infantile question, but what qualifies as interesting", "no, it\u2019s not an infantile question", "that is, in fact, the core question", "to the extent that a writer deserves his or her paycheck, it comes down to how good are they at looking through a transcript and understanding what\u2019s interesting", "you have to sort of visualize what the story is going to become before it has become anything", "so you might be dealing with a document that is 20,000 words or even longer", "it could be 30,000 words, which is enormous", "i mean, my books are 75, 000 words", "so you\u2019re dealing with a single interview that might be a third of a book in length", "and you have to distill out of that, i don\u2019t know, a couple thousand words", "so that process can take days", "and i initially go through, and i simply delete all of the stuff that clearly doesn\u2019t belong", "just that dead space", "and then, i just take repeated passes, pruning and pruning and pruning until i know the interview almost by heart", "and then, what i\u2019m left with is the stuff that matters", "if you don\u2019t transcribe it yourself, it\u2019s so much harder", "there are enormous benefits to taking that huge amount of time necessary to transcribe it yourself", "to transcribe yourself", "and once you have these nuggets, these various highlights, how do you determine what starts a chapter or a book for that matter", "well, that\u2019s the other thing", "that\u2019s another thing that kind of qualifies you as a writer", "the truth is that there are so many ways you can do it", "there are so many answers to the problem that i don\u2019t get too hung up on it", "i sort of think that it\u2019s not a math question where there\u2019s only one answer", "so as long as you understand there is not just one good answer, it takes the pressure off", "but, typically, i might try out several openings", "it\u2019s made easier by the fact that i don\u2019t start at the beginning", "so once you don\u2019t start at the beginning, your life just gets so much simpler", "so on that point, i have a tendency to always try the, and i think this has become a bit of a crutch for me because it seems to work well, but it\u2019s become a bit of a trope, if that\u2019s the right word, for me where i\u2019m always doing in media rests", "so i\u2019m always taking some exciting moment right in the middle of x that then requires explanation", "and i get into that later in the piece", "but i found myself doing that, effectively, all of the time", "not to turn this into like a writer/doctor consultation", "but do you ever find yourself doing that and you\u2019re like, this recipe works, but i want to play with other recipes", "well, that\u2019s why i wanted to do a podcast like this so much, which was that, with a podcast, you\u2019re still storytelling", "but suddenly, the list of considerations is different", "it really matters how good your tape is, how powerful the voices are, how meaningful the interaction you have with the person you\u2019re interviewing is", "so all of those things, do you have archival tape that is incredibly powerful", "so one of the shows is about, another of my favorites, i have two favorites, this is the other one, it\u2019s about giving", "it sounds boring when i say that", "it\u2019s about university of philanthropy", "and i contrast two very wealthy men who reach very different conclusions about where they\u2019re going to give their money", "and one of the men is my hero, and one is my villain", "and the hero, i don\u2019t want to spoil it, but there was a little bit of tape, the hero had just died", "and the school that he had given his money to had a memorial service for him", "and at the memorial service, a local a cappella group sang a kind of semi cheesy, boy band song, and i have forgotten the title of it, in memoriam of him but in such a way that it wasn\u2019t cheesy anymore", "it was actually, really touching", "and so you hear this tape, and you hear this a cappella group singing a song", "and your initial thought is, oh, my god", "and then, you\u2019re like oh, and you get it", "the emotion hits you", "now, if you\u2019re writing about that, it\u2019s meaningless", "all of that nuance is lost", "in a podcast, suddenly, you\u2019re like oh, wow, that\u2019s my beginning", "no question", "that\u2019s the way in because you want that movement from oh, this is cheesy to oh, my god, no", "it\u2019s incredibly meaningful", "that little thing", "so that\u2019s what lovely", "it\u2019s, suddenly, after 20 years of doing the pure print thing, i have to break out of that and think in a different way about what\u2019s powerful", "you are a very good public speaker", "i think you\u2019re a tremendous speaker", "how do you plan your keynotes because this is, yet, a different format", "if you think of your most successful, so then perhaps a less successful, presentation, how have they differed", "well, first of all, the breakthrough for me in speaking came when i realized that it required about 10 x more work than i was giving to it", "and that was a huge moment", "so i decided do \u2013 what made you realize that", "sorry to interrupt", "was there a particular incident or conversation", "no, it was about 10 years ago when i asked myself the question do i want to continue doing this because it has its pluses and its minuses", "and i realized i only want to continue doing it if i get much better at it and if i change it in a way that it\u2019s much more meaningful to me", "so it was then i decided i needed way more material", "i have to give very, very different speeches", "i can\u2019t just give the same one all of the time", "i have to spend a lot more time thinking about who i\u2019m speaking to", "and i have to spend a lot more time thinking about my performance, and, realizing, by the way, that it is a performance", "that i\u2019m not giving a speech, i\u2019m giving a performance", "and all of those things, i thought a lot about all of those things", "and it took a long time to kind of fully implement them", "but it has made it much more interesting to me", "and i enjoy it in a way i didn\u2019t enjoy it when i was \u2013 i didn\u2019t feel like i was doing it in a kind of halfway manner", "but i realized, in retrospect, i was just because i hadn\u2019t understood", "i thought that what giving a speech was was reading an article", "and if you think that\u2019s what it is, then, you just get up, and you read your article", "actually, no, it\u2019s a world that has its own rules and principles", "you\u2019re really acting", "then, you\u2019re like oh, wow, that\u2019s totally different", "i\u2019ve got to throw myself into that in a significant way", "and so that\u2019s what i tried to do", "is there anyone in the world of speaking, alive or dead, who is the michael louis for you", "i once went to a birthday party for an old, old friend of mine", "and it was in england", "i can say my friend anne applebaum", "she\u2019s been in england for years, and she has all of these sort of kind of fancy english friends", "when i say fancy, not posh but historians and just kind of english intellectuals", "so she had this birthday party in this little country house in the middle of england", "and the english, of course, a) way better at giving speeches than we are, first of all", "but secondly, we were talking about the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of english speech givers", "like serious kind of cambridge and oxford debating society kind of people", "so then neil ferguson, the historian, gave a birthday toast, which is just the best toast i\u2019ve ever heard in my life", "i mean, it was like so much better than anything i\u2019d ever heard", "it was on another level", "i was like oh, my god, that\u2019s good", "and part of what made it genius was he really gave you the impression he was making it up on the spot", "now, he might, actually, have one that", "he may be so good he could do that", "but he got up, and the conceit was this is off the cuff", "this is totally spontaneous", "and it was so cleverly done and so hilarious", "and the other thing i realized was that it was so charming", "and what was charming about it was the ways in which he was wrong", "kind of part of the joke was he was going to make this elaborate, hilarious argument about anne who was turning 50", "and half the stuff that he was going to say was not right", "that was sort of like \u2013 did he start off saying that", "no, no", "he sort of spun a theory about the weekend and about her birthday and about her friends", "that was like hilarious because it was not accurate", "but it was like he did it with such panache", "and first of all, that would never have occurred to me to make stuff up in such a dramatic way", "but also, i can do conversational", "i don\u2019t think i ever got to the level where people think i\u2019m off the cuff", "i\u2019m not", "it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s been some effort here", "but with him, it was just like \u2013 i worship the guy", "i think he walks on water", "what are the elements of a good performance for you", "what are some of the ingredients that make a good performance, in your case", "the thing that i strive for in speaking is authenticity, which sounds corny", "but it\u2019s really hard to do when you\u2019re giving a prepared talk to a group of people who belong to a world that you don\u2019t belong to", "so if i\u2019m speaking to a group of it specialists, i don\u2019t know anything about it, right", "nothing", "so i\u2019m an outsider", "and i\u2019m trying to say something that will engage them and be intelligent and make them think", "so in the context of doing something that is artificial, by artificial i don\u2019t mean phony, i mean, in a sense that i have to make an effort to connect with them", "i can\u2019t just stand up and talk the way i would talk to my friends", "these guys belong to a world i don\u2019t know or belong to", "so i\u2019m doing something that requires an effort", "but, at the same time, it has to feel like me", "they have to feel like they are connecting with me and that i can\u2019t feel like i\u2019m faking it", "so that\u2019s hard", "and that\u2019s hard in a good way", "that\u2019s what makes it interesting", "so the question i ask myself is i would like to say something intelligent about it while still remaining true to myself, someone who knows very little about it", "so and if you pull it off, that\u2019s interesting to the audience", "so they get that", "they\u2019re not bringing me in because i\u2019m an it specialist", "but what satisfies them is my attempt to speak to them while being true to myself", "can i bridge the gap is the question really that they\u2019re asking themselves in the back of their mind", "and when you can bridge the gap, that\u2019s really satisfying to someone", "it\u2019s like i think you\u2019ve succeeded", "and just a few more questions about writing because i\u2019m most likely about to go into, as we discussed briefly, a crunch writing deadline myself", "when you have, for instance, one or two stories for a book, and you understand what the theme is going to be or some of the structural components, how do you find the others", "or is it a case where you\u2019ve gathered these stories over the span of a time with the inkling of an idea, and then, you have half of it locked and loaded already", "well, there\u2019s a good example of this from revisionist history, from this podcast", "i started out by wanting to tell a story about this kid who i had met who was a teenager and lived in la, came from a poor family, and had, i don\u2019t know what his iq is, 150", "he\u2019s a one in a million kid", "and i thought his story of what happens to you if you have an iq of 150, and you grow up in south central", "that\u2019s sort of interesting", "so i was going to tell that story", "and so i talked to the kid", "and i was particularly interested in how does he get to college", "is it easy", "do you get recognized", "is it like you\u2019re a great 15-year-old basketball player, and they always find you", "if you can dunk a basketball and hit a three point shot, and you could dominate your middle school basketball team, and you live in nebraska, they find you, right", "so my question was is that what it\u2019s like if you\u2019ve got an iq of 150 and you live in south central, do they just find you and adopt you", "so i went out, and i had this long conversation with this kid", "it was incredibly powerful", "it was totally interesting", "and then, as i tell the story, i realize, oh, so my episodes are 45 minutes", "and i realized this story is all i need", "he\u2019s the whole thing", "i can do little contextual things", "but there\u2019s no room for anything else here", "not just room logistically or physically, but there\u2019s no emotional room for anything else", "this kid is \u2013 you\u2019re in tears by the end", "and what happened to him, and his story is crazy", "and then, there\u2019s this other kid we talk about", "it\u2019s like you can\u2019t", "so then, i said there are other things i wanted to say", "so i do another show also on the same topic of how good are we at fulfilling the america dream, the american promise, which is, if you work hard, and you have some ability, you can make your way up the ladder", "so this part of revisionist history is revisiting that promise that we make", "how good are we at fulfilling it", "so i do a second show, which is all about do colleges find these kids", "do they do a good job of finding them", "how do they find them", "do they spend a lot of time and money on it", "and the answer is the colleges do a terrible job of finding them", "so we asked why", "so i did a show on why do they do a terrible job", "and the answer is, a lot of the time, they\u2019re distracted", "but more than that, they\u2019re spending their money somewhere else", "it takes money to find these kids", "not just to find them, if the cost of educating a kid is $50,000.00, and you want to bring in a kid from south central, he doesn\u2019t have $50,000.00", "so you\u2019ve got to pay $50,000.00", "you\u2019re out $50,000.00 if you want to bring him to your school", "so if you\u2019re going to spend $50,000.00 on him, it\u2019s $50,000.00 you can\u2019t spend on something else", "that starts to get really interesting", "all right", "so what\u2019s the thing you can\u2019t spend on", "and if you can\u2019t spend on that other thing, how do you compete with other colleges that do spend on the other thing", "so that\u2019s what the whole upset is about", "so then, i do that one, and i\u2019m like wait a minute, i\u2019m not done", "this gets more interesting", "so if you\u2019ve got to find the $50,000.00, then where do you get the $50,000.00", "so now, we get into philanthropy", "that\u2019s where i did this whole thing on philanthropy", "so that was the third one", "so these are all stories that grow out of \u2013 it all starts with one kid", "i find the kid, and all of a sudden, i end up with three very different stories all of which look at the problem of the kid from a different angle", "and that\u2019s very typical of the way books work for me, which is you start with the nugget, and then, you just start walking around it", "and parts of it just kind of \u2013 you\u2019re like oh, that deserves its own \u2013 it\u2019s like the thing i find myself doing when i interview someone, most often, is stopping them", "saying wait, wait, wait", "when i transcribe the tapes, i hear that so many times", "wait, wait, stop", "and then, i make them go back and elaborate on that point, which was like that kind of weird point", "they skip over it because it\u2019s old hat to them", "and you\u2019re like no, no, no", "i could spend hours on that point, you know", "oh, i do", "i know exactly how that feels", "and it strikes me that you ask questions as part of that walking around the first story", "and you ask a question that then redirects you or focuses you into another topic", "you find a story, and then, you ask another question, which then leads to, in this case, another episode, but it could have been another chapter of a book", "if you were to credit someone or some people or resources with helping you to get better at asking questions, who or what would that be", "my dad is a great question asker", "and my father has this, and i\u2019ve spoken about it many times, of his many gifts, one in particular, as a kid, always had the biggest impact on me, which is my father has zero intellectual insecurities", "so this is the only thing he has in common with obama", "he and obama are the same way", "it has never crossed his mind to be concerned that the world thinks he\u2019s an idiot", "he\u2019s not in that game", "so if he doesn\u2019t understand something, he just asks you", "he doesn\u2019t care if he sounds foolish", "he will ask the most obvious question", "and it was without any sort of concern about it", "and maybe it\u2019s because my dad is a mathematician", "so he has this thing that he knows he\u2019s really good at.\u00a0and so he\u2019s home free", "if you have a phd in math, you\u2019re home free", "well, if something is either true or it\u2019s false, or it\u2019s clear or it\u2019s not", "yeah", "and it\u2019s like if you look like an idiot because you don\u2019t know anything about basketball, who cares", "so he asks lots and lots and lots of dumb, in the best sense of that word, dumb questions", "he\u2019ll say to someone i don\u2019t understand", "explain that to me", "and he\u2019ll just keep asking questions until he gets it right", "and i grew up listening to him do this in every conceivable setting", "my father, here is this guy with his phd in math", "he made friends with all of these farmers who were our neighbors who were all drop outs", "this was in canada", "in canada", "they all had, basically, maybe seventh grade", "and he, first of all, treated them like equals", "and secondly, he was intensely interested in what they knew that he didn\u2019t know and would ask them tons and tons of questions about why they did what they did", "so that\u2019s what i grew up around", "and that\u2019s what i do", "i mean, it\u2019s straight from my dad", "and when i\u2019m hanging out with my father and someone interesting, we do the same thing", "we just start asking questions", "it\u2019s our sort of thing", "well, it strikes me also that the dumb questions or the obvious questions are precisely the questions, often times, we should be asking because half of the people in the room, if it\u2019s in a group setting, are probably thinking of those questions anyway but are embarrassed, for whatever reason, to bring them up", "do you know what is a great example of this", "i often imagine my dad meeting bernie madoff", "my father would look at the returns, and he would say, \u201cwow, that\u2019s really good.\u201d because, as a mathematician, he would know that these steady, whatever it was, 9 percent a year, year in/year out", "and he would say, \u201chow did you do that?\u201d and madoff had, remember, that stock explanation that was bullshit", "and my father would just simply continue to ask really, really, dumb, obvious questions until madoff would either have had to leave because he would have tried his patience and been at risk of \u2013 but he would never have invested money with him because he would have said, \u201ci don\u2019t understand,\u201d 100 times", "i don\u2019t understand how that works", "i don\u2019t understand", "like in this kind of dumb kind of slow voice", "i don\u2019t understand, sir", "what is going on", "so let me ask, and feel free to not answer this if you don\u2019t want", "so i ask a lot of questions", "i enjoy asking a lot of questions", "it can drive some people crazy", "did your mom get the 20 questions about a lot of things", "or was the relationship different", "oh, she asked lots of questions, too", "she\u2019s not intellectually insecure either", "it wasn\u2019t directed at my mother", "it was directed at the outside world", "they have an exceedingly harmonious relationship", "they don\u2019t do that", "it\u2019s reserved for outsiders really", "to what would you attribute the harmony", "because there are a lot of unharmonious relationships in the world", "i mean, they were lucky to be well suited", "they\u2019re also both incredibly calm people", "so they have very little conflict because they diffuse conflict really well", "i think it probably would be a good way of saying it", "so they can speak rationally", "yeah", "i\u2019ve never seen them pick a fight with each other, for example", "it doesn\u2019t interest them", "i have so many questions that i want to ask you", "i\u2019m just going to jump into a rather non cohesive list of miscellanea", "i\u2019m going to try some new ones this time around", "what is the best or most worthwhile investment you\u2019ve ever made?\u00a0it could be money, time, energy, or otherwise, or just a very good investment", "that\u2019s an interesting question", "all of the investments, the most worthwhile investments, are investments about time", "they have to do with time", "and they\u2019re all about persevering past the point that i would normally have quit", "so i can think, for example, of books where the payoff didn\u2019t come until page 1,000", "and yet, getting to that page was incredibly important in some future endeavor", "or when i was describing how i ran across that transcript of that school shooter, which that was about an investment of time where i was sort of looking for much longer than i would normally look", "i kind of, for reasons i don\u2019t really understand, put my impatience aside committed a much longer period of time to that hunt", "so i would say those are probably the, it\u2019s a very broad category, but those were the best investments", "now, when you said page 1,000, you\u2019re talking about reading", "yeah", "but, i mean, generally speaking, hunting \u2013 so many of the really wonderful things that i\u2019ve uncovered in my life, not just from my writing, but also personally, have come after elongated hunts", "so you never find the thing that is moving and powerful in the first five minutes", "it just doesn\u2019t happen", "i remember a friend of mine who i didn\u2019t really feel very friendly towards when he said this said to me, when i was 90 percent done with my second book, the four hour body, and i said, \u201cwow, i\u2019m pretty close to the finish line, 90 percent done.\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201ccongratulations", "you only have 50 percent left.\u201d and i\u2019ve heard that from a lot of long distance runners also", "like how the race starts at mile 20 or whatever it might be", "going back to the sort of investments and these not postponed but delayed gratification wins like this page 1,000, can you think of any failures that set you up for later success or a favorite failure of yours", "yeah", "i mean, it\u2019s all kinds", "when i was a kid, this is one of many, but i was a very serious runner", "what distance", "the 1,500 meters and 800 meters", "the puking distances", "yes", "and in my third year of running seriously, i lost races i thought i was going to win in what for me, at that age, was quite a traumatic fashion", "and i quit running", "and i would regard that as the first real failure of my life, something i really wanted to do well at, i didn\u2019t", "and i feel like it was hugely important both because it made me think hard about what my priorities were", "i had placed running too high in that list", "but more than that, i then, later in life, went back and thought a lot about why i quit and was dissatisfied with my reasons", "so this whole notion of circling back i think is so important", "this show is called revisionist history", "so it\u2019s explicitly about that", "but i would almost obsessively revisit my reasons for quitting running and scrutinize them and say, \u201cwas it right", "what did i learn in the intervening five, ten, fifteen, twenty years about who i am, what i want, what it takes to be good at something.\u201d so that was a really valuable experience at exactly the right time because that\u2019s the age where decisions, not decisions matter, but where i think you reflect on thing in your adolescents in a way that you don\u2019t reflect on things later in life", "and what age was this or what grade", "i was 15", "fifteen", "i always thought i was going to go back, at some point, and be a ninth grade teacher", "so right around that 14 to 16 range", "it seems like there are a lot of very important forks in the road", "yeah, i think there is", "i think you are because everything is plastic at that age", "so you can mold it whatever way you want", "and so it\u2019s just a kind of like i think about how confusing and complicated those years are in retrospect", "do you have any morning routines", "what does the first 60 minutes of your day look like", "it could be any day of the week", "let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a work day", "well, i was just saying earlier, i think one should eat very little in the morning", "what time do you wake up", "you know, 8:00", "i have a big thing of tea", "what type of tea", "sorry, i\u2019m going to keep \u2013 lapsang souchong", "oh, that\u2019s great stuff", "great stuff", "i remember a friend loved whiskey, and he felt like the smell reminded him of some type of pd alcoholic beverage", "yeah, it has an amazing smell", "it\u2019s a very controversial tea", "and then, i might have \u2013 i\u2019m going to pull a malcolm here", "wait, wait, wait, why is it a controversial tea", "some people smell it, and they just run in the opposite direction", "they don\u2019t even think it\u2019s tea", "i\u2019ve never seen people have such a kind of \u2013 and there\u2019s a little coffee shop where i go often in the morning to have my tea", "and they have it", "i think i\u2019m one of the only people who order it", "i think they get it because of me", "and it\u2019s like i walk in, and they make a beeline for it", "but it\u2019s clear that i\u2019m in a distinct minority", "it smells", "i mean, you can smell it from quite a ways off", "i might eat a little bit of oatmeal", "that\u2019s pretty much all i\u2019ll eat in the morning", "that\u2019s one of your go to\u2019s", "yeah", "but not a lot", "and then, i look at three websites", "okay", "so we\u2019re going to come back to the three websites", "so not a lot means a cup full, a couple of spoons", "like a cup full, half a cup, something like that", "just enough that i have something in my stomach", "and then, i will look at three websites", "the first one is let\u2019s run.com", "all serious runners read let\u2019s run", "then, i read marginal revolution, tara cohen\u2019s column", "and then, i read espn.com just to make sure nothing major happened in the world of sports", "and then, i start my work", "and what time is that then when you\u2019re starting your work", "so we\u2019re still before 9:00", "and then, if i have writing to do, it\u2019s best to do it in the two hours that follow", "so before lunch", "yeah", "and what does your routine look like in those few hours when you start your work", "what does that look like", "is there particular music you listen to", "sitting in a coffee shop", "sitting in a coffee shop", "or some restaurant", "i\u2019m not at home", "and i\u2019m not in the office", "and i\u2019m working pretty steadily", "i\u2019m not really easily distractible", "then, around 11:30 or so, i kind of have to do other things", "i mean, i don\u2019t stop working, but i stop writing", "do you listen to music when you write", "do you just take in the ambiance", "if there\u2019s music on in the \u2013 i write almost entirely in public places", "so i don\u2019t listen to music myself", "no headphones", "but i like the noise because i came of age in a newsroom", "so i need that", "i mean, i learned how to write in the middle of when newsrooms, they\u2019re not noisy now, they used to be incredibly loud.\u00a0so that\u2019s what i need to kind of get going", "and then, is that when the bulk of your writing is done is that pre-lunch period", "or do you write in the afternoons and evenings", "no, i rarely write in the afternoon", "yeah", "journalists seem to be very adaptable, or former journalists, people who have worked in newspapers or have had those types of daily deadlines", "yeah, we\u2019re faster", "and also, remember, writing is not the time consuming part", "it\u2019s knowing what to write", "it\u2019s the thinking and the arranging and the interviewing and the researching and the organizing", "that\u2019s what takes time", "writing is blissful", "i wish i could do it more", "it\u2019s a break from all of the hassle", "let\u2019s just say end of work day to bed, what do your wind down routines look like or pre-bed", "well, i go running then probably after the end of the afternoon", "and i\u2019m injured now, but that\u2019s really the highlight of the kind of work day", "some days, i\u2019ll go to train with my track club", "sometimes, i go for a long run", "or i\u2019ll go biking, or i\u2019ll go to a cross fit workout, something physical to get going", "what is your favorite movement in cross fit or exercise and the least", "well, runners secretly distain any activity that is not running", "i know enough runners to know you\u2019re right", "so i don\u2019t even want to think about favorite in that context", "it\u2019s something i suffer through because it\u2019s necessary to ward off injury", "and when it\u2019s over, i\u2019m very happy", "but i\u2019m much happier if i can go and run 8 miles with some friends", "got it", "pre-bed, anything in particular", "no", "i\u2019ll eat dinner", "i might read in the evening", "i watch sports or tv", "do you have trouble getting to sleep, or do you generally sleep easily", "i come from a family of we are champion sleepers", "gladwells, we\u2019re epic", "some of the best sleepers out there", "we are some of the best", "it is our defining characteristic", "our definition of a bad night of sleep is so hilarious because it\u2019s like my father will say he had trouble sleeping", "and what that means is he was up for 20 minutes between 4:00 and 4:20", "that\u2019s a bad night of sleep", "so if the gladwells are heading up the leader board in sleep, what are you guys not good at, or you personally", "what are we not good at", "what do you find challenging", "well, we\u2019re not great talkers", "we\u2019re all pretty introverted, with the exception of my brother who makes up for it", "we\u2019re not terribly adventurous", "i mean, we\u2019re adventurous in certain very, very specific ways", "but i didn\u2019t grow up going \u2013 we would go on family vacations to either england or jamaica where both of my parents are from", "my father would travel a lot to interesting places", "but we never went out to eat or went to the movies or went to concerts", "the sort of going out thing was not something we did", "i would go entire summers when i, basically, never left the house", "so we didn\u2019t explore our immediate surroundings in a way that we might have", "what is an example of the worst advice that you hear being dispensed or given", "it could be related to anything, writing, running, doesn\u2019t matter", "the worst advice that, in general, we give in america is that we terrify high school kids about their college choices", "all things related to college fall under the category of bad advice", "as you will find out when you listen to my rants about college on this podcast, i think the america college system needs to be blown up and they need to start over", "to my mind, you could not have conceived of a worse system", "so any advice that has to do with you need to work hard and get into the best college you can, i\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just bullshit", "it\u2019s just terrible", "you should not try to go to the best college you can, particularly if best is defined by us news and world report", "the sole test of what a good college is is it a place where i find myself late at night having deeply interesting conversations with people that i like and find interesting", "you go where you can do that", "that\u2019s all that matters", "so am i so inspired by what i learned during the day that i want to be talking about it at 1:00 in the morning", "and do i have someone who will have that conversation with me and will challenge me", "that\u2019s it", "that\u2019s it", "everything else is nonsense", "so you tell me what that place is", "now, so that place could be any number of 1,000 places in the world", "maybe even that place is unpredictable", "maybe it is that what matters is not that some schools can provide that experience and some can\u2019t", "what matters is what happens when i go to that school", "do i create that experience for myself", "and i think that experience could be created at almost any institution in the country", "there are interesting kids everywhere", "and it\u2019s only in our snobbery that we have decided that interestingness is defined by your test scores", "this is just such an outrageous lie", "test scores, sure they matter in some way, but i\u2019m talking about college now", "what makes for a powerful college experience is can i find someone interesting to have an interesting discussion with", "and you can do that if you\u2019re curious and you\u2019re interesting", "that\u2019s it.\u00a0not that you\u2019re interesting, you\u2019re interested", "that\u2019s all that matters", "which comes back to the questions, having the ability and the ammo to ask good questions and follow up questions", "by the way, some of the people that you learn most from in those settings are some of the most flawed people", "it\u2019s not true that you learn the most from the smartest, most put together people", "i think about my college experience, the people who had a lasting impact on me were deeply, deeply flawed people", "and their flaws were what almost drew me to them and what i kind of fixated on and found fascinating", "i had a friend, still one of my very best friends, ended up being very, very successful", "in college, he was a basket case, complete basket case to the point where he literally said this to me once", "i said, \u201cwhy do you have a library book that\u2019s three months overdue", "your fine is going up every day.\u201d he said, \u201cwell, i\u2019m afraid to take it back because i can\u2019t afford the fine.\u201d he said this to me", "and simultaneously, he actually turned out to be a brilliant student or a brilliant professional", "and just squaring those two sides to his personality, the idea that he was hapless in some really crucial respects, and, yet, made an incredibly successful place for himself in the world", "figuring that contradiction out took years", "and when i did kind of figure it out, it so enhanced my understanding of people and the world and just understanding the ways that he compensated for his haplessness brilliantly", "and also, realizing that if you\u2019re hapless in that kind of logistical sense, common sense sense, he has no common sense, if you\u2019re thoughtful about it, it won\u2019t matter one iota", "what flaws or weaknesses do you have that have turned out to be strengths in some capacity", "this is like a job interview question, isn\u2019t it", "i was going to offer you a position at tim ferriss enterprises, but i think you\u2019re too busy", "well, probably, god \u2013 it\u2019s only a job interview if you say sometimes i just work too hard", "exactly", "in dealing with my own impatience and my sloppiness and to attending to those flaws, i think that\u2019s been a really crucial thing in helping me achieve what i\u2019ve achieved", "so it\u2019s just \u2013 can you elaborate on that", "yeah", "i mean, i\u2019m sloppy", "in what sense", "sloppy like clothes all over the floor or \u2013 no, no, no", "sloppy about i\u2019m in a hurry, i don\u2019t always double check something i know", "or i\u2019ll interview someone for 45 minutes when i should interview them for 2 hours", "i\u2019m just kind of like i\u2019m a good enough person", "i\u2019m not a perfectionist", "it\u2019s fine", "and so i\u2019ve become so aware of that now that i\u2019ve compensated", "and i have taught myself to be a lot more of a perfectionist, or i\u2019ve forced myself to keep asking questions much longer than i would have", "when i said earlier that it was these investments of time that have been so \u2013 that\u2019s what i\u2019m talking about", "i\u2019ve forced myself to invest more time in a lot of activities knowing that, if i did it my normal way, i\u2019d be out the door", "i\u2019d be thinking about what i want for dinner as opposed to \u2013 so that\u2019s sort of a very \u2013 it\u2019s why, by the way, i so object to when you observe or measure someone\u2019s natural inclinations, you haven\u2019t got a picture of them because you don\u2019t know what they do with those natural inclinations", "so it turns out that one of the most important things about me is how obsessed i am with those two flaws of mine", "so identifying those as my natural inclinations tells you exactly the opposite about me", "because you\u2019re compensating by developing the opposite", "i am massively compensating for them all day long", "i\u2019m obsessed with compensating for them", "have you received a lot of bad advice along the way as to what you might do professionally", "or has that not been the case", "no", "i mean, i\u2019m not an advice seeker about those kinds of things nor much of an advice giver", "so i haven\u2019t really gotten a lot of \u2013 and also, my position is you can\u2019t know", "i\u2019ve kind of stumbled into most of the things i\u2019ve been doing", "i much prefer just simply to be open to opportunity than to plan my path", "i think that\u2019s better, for me anyway", "i don\u2019t know", "people are different", "so some people need to plan", "but i don\u2019t think ahead really at all", "your comment about the compensation and just that last mile, so to speak, with the interviews and so on reminds me of laird hamilton, the surfer", "he was trying to teach me, he had a lot of patience, how to surf at one point a few years ago", "and he said, \u201cwhen you think you\u2019ve caught a wave, paddle again because, if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s like that last paddle when you think you\u2019re there, you\u2019re just not going to catch the wave.\u201d when you think of the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind and why", "well, i\u2019m so deeply obsessed with running these days that i immediately think of runners", "that\u2019s fine", "there\u2019s an american runner, gaylin rupp, who is maybe our silver medalist in the london games in the 10,000", "and i really admire him for many reasons", "he\u2019s, first of all, a system runner", "that is to say he was sort of identified in high school as being someone of promise", "he\u2019s been with the same coach ever since", "and he had a very thoughtful training path and career path", "what was his name again", "gaylin rupp", "and he\u2019s also a very beautiful runner", "both of those things matter to me", "what makes a beautiful runner", "is it gait", "if you looked him up on the internet, and you looked at the way he moved, you would say he\u2019s like a ballet dancer", "he just has grace", "there are ugly runners, and there are beautiful runners", "he\u2019s a beautiful runner", "those two things in combination and the idea that he, on an esthetic level, are deeply pleasing", "so he does the thing that he wants to do not just successfully by the standard metric, he runs very quickly, he wins races, but also by a purely irrelevant esthetic metric", "he creates beauty as he\u2019s doing it", "that matters to me", "and it matters to me that he\u2019s so thoughtful, purposeful in his, to use that phrase, in his preparation that it\u2019s not happenstance or that he\u2019s sort of thought about what does it mean for me, gaylin rupp, to bring out the best in myself", "and running is tricky because running is all about restraint, even, especially, at the elite level", "you can\u2019t be obsessive or a perfectionist and succeed as a runner", "you\u2019ll get injured", "running is all about good enough", "because you will have too much training volume", "yeah", "you\u2019re walking this fine line between adequately preparing yourself for racing and overtraining, which leads to injury and burn out and all of these kinds of things", "and the whole struggle in running is to not get injured, to not cross that line", "and so in order to not cross that line, you have to rein in all of these tendencies", "your obsessiveness, you want to do the tenth repetition", "you\u2019re doing 10 times of whatever, half miles", "and you know, logically, that after nine, that\u2019s enough", "you\u2019ve pushed your body as far as it can go", "but your kind of anal disciplined self says no, do 10 because 10 was the workout", "you can\u2019t do 10", "you have to be tough enough to say no, no, no, i\u2019ve done enough for the day and walk away", "do you know how hard that is", "particularly for the kinds of personalities that are attracted to elite running", "it\u2019s insane", "that kind of notion of how hard it is to say it\u2019s good enough and walk away", "it\u2019s like he does that", "so a couple of things", "it makes me think about a story i heard related to charlie francis, a very controversial sprint coach, ben johnson and so on", "the reality is he was a brilliant coach", "and i hate to say it, but i\u2019m not going to point fingers at any specific people, but very likely that all of the top sprinters at that level are using something besides spiralina", "were", "i\u2019m not sure it\u2019s still true, but go on", "in that era, in charlie francis\u2019s era, absolutely, yeah", "that was kind of the golden age of doping in a sense, but the athletes always have more resources than the [inaudible] in terms of testing and that cat and mouse game", "but some really interesting things that have come out just recently", "i\u2019ll give an example", "so there was a period of time where the vast majority of world championship or olympic sprinters had prescriptions due to their narcolepsy because they wanted to take modafinil as a stimulant pre-race", "but i digress", "but what charlie said was, in the case of an elite sprinter, someone said how do you push your athletes", "and he said, \u201cno, no, no, the last thing i need to do is push my athletes", "it\u2019s my job to rein them in", "i always have to rein them in.\u201d and he would have to say no, charlie, you can\u2019t do two sets of squats with 600 pounds on your back at 160 or whatever it was", "you have to do one set and so on", "but i wanted to come back to plan", "so you said you\u2019re not much for plans, but you are one for systems", "so it made me think of, it seems, at least in the case of running, it made me think of, and i\u2019m going to paraphrase here, there\u2019s a quote from i want to say jeff bazo something along the lines of we\u2019re uncompromising on the vision and flexible on the details", "where do you have systems in your life that you rely on", "i wish i had more systems sometimes", "i don\u2019t really have a lot of \u2013 i mean, because now, i\u2019m essentially self employed and don\u2019t go \u2013 i mean, i have discipline, personal discipline", "but is it that rigid", "part of the reason i say i think gaylin rupp is successful is because i\u2019m a little bit envious of the system and structure that he has in place", "and it\u2019s occurred to me how much can be achieved when you\u2019re that kind of thoughtful about what you\u2019re doing", "as someone who is as obsessed with sports as i am, the thing that always breaks your heart is someone who leaves potential on the table", "and i don\u2019t think gaylin rupp has", "and that is an extraordinary achievement", "to be able to say when he retires, \u201ci ran as fast as i could possibly have run,\u201d that is more important than to say i won a gold medal or i set a world record", "and i don\u2019t mean that in a kind of cheesy \u2013 i really mean that", "to say i got at 99 percent of my ability is huge", "and i think folks would be surprised, and you\u2019ve probably interacted with many more elite runners than i have, but i\u2019ve met people, a few of them, and i\u2019ve also interacted with coaches and physical therapists who have worked with people like jackie joyner-kersee", "and it\u2019s very common that they would say, about that level of athlete, they\u2019ve never let it all go and really given 100 percent because of whether it\u2019s fear of a hamstring tear, fear of x, fear of y, z, whatever it might be", "so the fact that this runner is leaving it all on the track \u2013 yeah", "so it\u2019s interesting", "we\u2019ve been talking", "there are two necessarily contradictory things here with runners, which is training is about restraint but racing is not", "so that\u2019s why we\u2019re still getting at the psychology of these elite athletes is so complex", "restrain, restrain, restrain in preparation", "get on the track and, all of a sudden, no, no more restraint", "go", "all of that behavior you\u2019ve been conditioning, no, ignore all that", "and as i returned to running quite recently and running in a serious way, and that\u2019s the piece of it that\u2019s proving really hard for me to grasp is that idea of turning it on on race day", "so i train very well", "and i race less well and for that very reason", "whereas i look around me, really elite runners, the difference between their training and racing is astounding like they\u2019re just different animals", "it\u2019s fascinating to see that", "what books, besides your own, have you gifted to other people the most", "there\u2019s one book i\u2019ve given the most in my life, which is a book called \u2013 well, there are several now that i think about it", "there\u2019s a book by timothy wilson called strangers to ourselves, which is one of the loveliest, most insightful books about social psychology that i ever read", "and i give that a lot to people", "and every time i meet, and really, i\u2019m always meeting people who work in retail, particularly i always send them, particularly if they\u2019re jewish, i send them a book called the merchant princes", "it\u2019s a book about the great jewish retail families of america", "so in the 19th century, all of these people come over from europe who have experience in the garment trade or retailing", "and an extraordinary number of the early 20th century/late 19th century department stores pop up around america are founded by jewish immigrants from europe from, literally, you go to any town in america, the traditional department store is from one of those families", "well, a guy, and i\u2019ve forgotten his name, wrote a book about those families, and it\u2019s called the merchant princes, and it\u2019s fantastic", "oh, princes plural, okay", "yes, it\u2019s fantastic", "it\u2019s about everything i\u2019m interested in", "it\u2019s about immigrants", "it\u2019s about people figuring out and then conquering an unfamiliar marketplace", "it\u2019s about all of the brilliant ideas that came to these guys as they invented the department store", "the ideas that, by the way, all of these internet retailers, they\u2019re just grandchildren of these guys", "i mean, there\u2019s nothing dramatically new has happened", "they worked it all out 100 years ago", "i mean, it really humbles you about the so-called retail revolution of the last 10 years", "and they\u2019re such extraordinary characters", "and i love the way their personality is kind of imprinted on their business", "so there\u2019s a fantastic chapter about filenes, the filene brothers who start filene\u2019s in boston", "which they have filene\u2019s basement and so on", "yeah", "and they invent these incredibly interesting ideas about how to hold a sale, how to use people\u2019s psychological impulses to generate the desire to buy", "these guys are so far ahead of everybody else", "it\u2019s like 100 years ago, and they are on another level", "just like it\u2019s one story like that after another", "it\u2019s a brilliant book", "do you read any fiction", "oh, huge amounts", "i read spy novels", "spy novels", "if it has the word spy in it, i\u2019ve read it", "so for someone who is unfamiliar with the genre, but excited to get started, where should they start", "well, i mean, how many hours do we have", "but if you know nothing about it, you should start with john le carre, of course, and read his first five books", "so i would read at least through tinker tailor soldier spy", "and you could keep going", "you should read through little drummer\u2019s girl or even russia house", "i like his later stuff less so", "but it\u2019s still fantastic", "but you must read spy came in from the cold", "i mean, that\u2019s just kind of like gold standard", "a given", "yeah", "and then, i read all of lee child\u2019s books", "they\u2019re not spy thrillers, per se, but they\u2019re thrillers", "those are fantastic", "i have hundreds", "i have literally hundreds of spy novels in my house", "what $100.00 or less purchase, this is ballpark, meaning not a bugatti or something, that has most positively impacted your life that comes to mind", "probably a piece of music", "i think it was probably an album by brian eno called another green world, which is one of his early \u201870s, it\u2019s ambient music, but not the kind of really weird ambient music", "there\u2019s an adage that says the music you discover when you are 18, i think it\u2019s 18 is the magic year, is the music that stays with you for the rest of your life", "well, i discovered that when i was 18", "and i sing the songs of that album in my head all of the time", "and i worship brian eno", "he\u2019s a fascinating guy", "have you interviewed him", "i haven\u2019t", "i would enjoy it though", "i have a collection of cards that he also put out called oblique strategies", "yes, i know about those", "and i have it right on top of there\u2019s another one called the whack pack, which is a series of odd questions just intended to help you", "he\u2019s genius", "he\u2019s also the most articulate person i\u2019ve ever met", "wow", "i should try to get mr", "eno on the podcast", "you should because just to listen to him talk, it\u2019s distracting how perfectly he talks", "he\u2019s one of those", "you just want to listen because it\u2019s perfectly done paragraphs", "it\u2019s ready for publication", "i mean, i can\u2019t explain the experience", "it\u2019s just kind of awe inspiring", "i\u2019ve had that experience when watching neil gaiman speak or listening to him speak and also perform", "it\u2019s just incredible", "what is something you believe that other people think is crazy", "or something that a lot of people believe that you think is crazy, aside from the college piece", "either one, but i\u2019m most interested in things that you believe that other people would raise an eyebrow to", "i think i believe in ghosts", "i like this", "all right", "tell me more", "i just do", "i don\u2019t understand", "my aunt who lives in jamaica used to live in this house called hilson hale, which was said to be haunted", "there was a particular room that was said to be haunted", "and so i slept in the room", "i was a kid", "i was 13 or 14", "and it was haunted", "i saw a ghost in there", "it played the guitar in the middle of the night", "i don\u2019t know", "and at that age, in jamaica, everyone believes in ghosts", "not everyone, but people believe in ghosts", "so do i think the house is haunted", "i actually do think it\u2019s haunted", "and i also don\u2019t understand if you believe in god, as i do, it\u2019s not that hard to believe in ghosts", "so i believe in the existence of things outside of my own, direct, physical experience", "and also, i don\u2019t know why that\u2019s controversial", "why people think that you can only believe in things that we have conventional explanations for and that you can see and touch", "well, that strikes me as being \u2013 why would you limit yourself like that", "i mean, i\u2019m not crazy", "i don\u2019t believe in ufo\u2019s, although, i don\u2019t rule them out", "i\u2019m not a kind of spiritualist", "but, in a kind of purely rational way, i believe there is stuff out there that can\u2019t be properly explained", "why", "because why would we have explanations for everything", "or not yet", "or not yet", "there\u2019s a ways to go", "just because there are phenomena that we can\u2019t currently explain or examine using the scientific method, which is sometimes poorly and sometimes properly implement, it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t", "and you just have to look back in the history books to see many, many, many examples of this", "yeah", "my other is identical twin", "and if you know an identical twin, you witness that they live \u2013 one lives in jamaica, one is in canada", "and they do that thing that twins do, which is they call each other and say i was so worried about you", "and then, the other one will say i just had some kind of accident", "or one will say i woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible pain in my stomach, and my mother is like that\u2019s because i just had an operation for \u2013 that kind of stuff, which is that weird thing you read about", "and it happens", "i don\u2019t know", "this is the second time this has come up on this podcast", "i had an identical twin on my podcast, and we talked about this", "so do i have a rational explanation for that", "does my mother", "no", "is it maybe a coincidence", "i don\u2019t know", "maybe", "it just needs explanation", "i don\u2019t have one", "but i\u2019m open to things that don\u2019t have an explanation", "so the question what is something you believe that other people think is insane is actually modified and kind of paraphrased wording of a question that peter teal likes to ask i suppose when he\u2019s interviewing founders", "what is your opinion of peter teal, if you have one", "all i know about him is what i know from this whole [inaudible] thing", "i know he\u2019s been a bad odor among some people", "and i never read his book, but i think he might have taken a shot at me", "i don\u2019t remember this", "so the zero to one, he takes issue with how he interprets your position as it relates to success and circumstantial factors or luck", "oh", "does he think there\u2019s more \u2013 he\u2019s more up to the individual.\nthat would be his position", "oh, i see", "that\u2019s a reasonable position", "i mean, the irony, in part, and one of my fans pointed this out, is that he talks in the very beginning of the book how failing to get, by a string of events outside of his control, failing to get a clerkship led to all of these other things that wouldn\u2019t have happened had he received the clerkship", "there we go", "are there any, and i\u2019m going to word this broadly, innovators \u2013 and that\u2019s sort of jumping, i live in silicon valley", "a lot of real innovators and even more people who like to fashion themselves as innovators, are there any people do you think that are engaged in very interesting innovation at the moment", "oh, wow", "obviously, so many people", "and most of the people doing the interesting stuff, we wouldn\u2019t even know about, would we", "they would have told us", "don\u2019t have publicists", "yeah", "i don\u2019t know if i have a good answer to that", "we could also take a retrospective because everything that was old is once new again, in terms of the retail", "so are there other examples of innovators that you\u2019ve become fascinated by", "for instance, i interviewed marc andreessen recently, an incredible tech icon, fascinating guy", "and he looks to people like walt disney and edison to apply lessons that they learned and habits they developed, rules they developed for themselves, too", "yeah", "i guess i would say my new yorker colleague, atul gawande has done all of this work with checklists", "such great stuff", "fantastic stuff", "and i really admire him because it\u2019s deeply unpopular work within his own profession", "but it\u2019s work that has extraordinary potential for saving lives", "and it\u2019s one of those things that, ultimately, has far more usefulness in the developing world than the developed world", "i mean, the line infection example and the checklist manifesto is just staggering", "but he took an extraordinary risk to his own reputation domestically in america in the medical profession by doing that", "doctors do not like checklists", "and they think of him as simplifying, dumbing down, they have all of these kind of epithets they use against him unfairly, i think, because he\u2019s not saying all medicine can be reduced to a checklist", "he\u2019s saying let\u2019s find the parts that can be and do it that way", "so i admire the idea", "but, almost more, i admire the kind of guts that made the idea possible", "so there are a number of books, about 20 or 30, that i have in my living room because i spend a lot of time there writing, often times, although, i do like to get out to a third location of some sense", "i\u2019ll go stir crazy", "but i have i\u2019d say about 10 books that are face out to remind me of certain things or to elicit certain emotions", "and the checklist manifesto is one of them", "oh, yeah", "he\u2019d be pleased to hear that", "the other thing, by the way, tons and tons of people write interesting things", "atul then went and put his ideas into action on a grand scale throughout the world", "follow through, so he\u2019s not this kind of intellectual holding forth", "he has the idea", "he takes the heat", "and then, he makes it happen in a real way around the world", "i mean, it\u2019s extraordinary", "very commendable", "what advice would you give to your \u2013 actually, before we get to that one, we talked about books", "do you have any favorite movies or documentaries that you\u2019ve seen multiple times", "no", "i\u2019m not really a movie or a documentary guy", "all right", "then, that\u2019s an easy pass to the advice you would give your 30-year-old self", "i would have left north america", "leave north america", "get out of there", "why", "because you\u2019ll wake up when you\u2019re 50 and realize that you spent your entire working career in north america, which is, despite the fact that it pretends to be the only place that matters, is not the only place that matters", "i would have been so much more interesting and thoughtful and insightful and whatever if i had experienced, particularly in the developing world", "i had an idea when i was in my 20\u2019s that i wanted to go and study in jamaica, a place where i have family and i have some familiarity with it", "i should have done it or some similar kind of thing", "i just think it\u2019s always my advice to young people, which is, particularly young people of privilege, is just leave", "go away", "you can come back, but you can\u2019t stay in the cocoon your whole life", "it will limit you in ways you cannot even begin to understand at this point", "i totally agree", "i was chatting with sebastian junger about \u2013 oh, he got out of the bubble", "yeah", "repeatedly", "about the system and also any potential remedies", "and he felt a mandatory year of, in his case, national service, but it could be volunteering with the peace corps after i think it was high school and spending a year exposing yourself to those types of environments before going into the \u201creal world\u201d somewhere", "in this case, north america", "two of the religious groups who take a lot of heat but for whom i have enormous respect, the mennonites and the mormons, have an institutionalized practice of sending people to other cultures", "their mission", "the mission", "and people who go on those missions come back transformed", "not just spiritually, but they have seen a side \u2013 and by the way, they\u2019re not going as american college students do when they do the year abroad to florence", "going to florence does not expand your horizons", "don\u2019t do a year abroad in paris", "that notion that i\u2019m going to break out of the box and go and spend six months in the [inaudible]", "bullshit", "go somewhere real.\u00a0that\u2019s the upside of that kind of experience", "when people have the means, i spent a year in japan as an exchange student at 15", "it was my first real time out of the united states", "and it completely rocked my world", "it called everything into question", "and so when people have the chance, they\u2019re like well, i\u2019m thinking about going here, here, here, and if japan is on the list, i always respond with, \u201cgo to japan because it will make no sense", "you won\u2019t be able to read anything", "and the english that you do read won\u2019t make any sense", "people do not speak english well", "and you should just walk until you get lost", "and then, try to find your way back because it\u2019s safe", "you won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d i went there for the first time two months ago", "oh, really", "blew my mind", "it was like, oh, my god, it\u2019s so interesting", "any favorite moments or frames", "i was there so briefly", "i had to come back, sadly, because i was working on this podcast", "but i was there for like four days", "i just walked around", "i did what i had to do, and then, i just went for this \u2013 i remember once, i was walking down a perfectly ordinary, random, residential street", "i was thirsty", "i saw a tiny sign called coffee", "so i look", "is there a coffee shop", "can\u2019t find it", "search", "finally have to go down some stairs, through doors, up some stairs through another door, and there\u2019s a room", "and there\u2019s a young woman behind a counter", "and she makes a cup of coffee that is so far and away the greatest cup of coffee i\u2019ve ever had", "nothing else is even close", "and then, i tried to tip her as one would, and she got offended and threw the money back", "but it was just like this impossible to find, in the middle of nowhere coffee shop that just kills any other", "but that\u2019s japan", "it\u2019s like walking through a fevered dream", "japan is so much fun", "so the podcast, how did you decide \u2013 no doubt you have had people propose that you do a podcast before", "i mean, i still think we\u2019re at the very early stages of adoption", "i think something like 15 or 17 percent of the people in the us have listened to podcasts", "it\u2019s very relatively minority group at this point", "why now", "what led to the decision", "well, my friend, jacob, who runs the slate group, an old, old friend of mine, they have panoply is there, a big podcasting company", "and he said, \u201cdo you want to do a podcast?\u201d and i said, \u201cno.\u201d and he said, \u201ccome on, do a podcast.\u201d so i said, \u201call right.\u201d it was literally that", "and then, i sort of got really into it and realized how fun it was", "and for all of the reasons i talked about earlier, just how it\u2019s a different way to tell a story", "what about it has been the most fun for you", "and maybe we covered it already", "i mean, it is \u2013 well, one is that i\u2019d never done a group experience, group thing before", "so creating in a group was super novel", "i don\u2019t even go to meetings, tim", "there are no meetings in my life", "and, suddenly, i went to meetings", "and i didn\u2019t realize everyone hates meetings, but i was like this is exciting", "so everything was just kind of like \u2013 and then, the idea of just the ability to generate emotion in a way you can\u2019t do on the page was just more than a revelation", "it was kind of i was entranced by that possibility", "it\u2019s transformative", "i mean, for me, this podcast started as a lark, something to do in between extremely exhausting book projects", "and when people \u2013 if any fans come up to me now when i\u2019m on the street, at least 9 times out of 10, probably even a higher percentage, talk about the podcast and not the books", "and, hopefully, that\u2019s not because my books are terrible", "that could mean that, relatively speaking, that is the case", "but i think the emotional response you\u2019re able to create and the emotional bond that is forged through the audio medium is just i have to imagine it\u2019s reflective of some hardwiring that we have as storytelling machines", "it\u2019s kind of an amazingly powerful thing", "where would you, and maybe this is to be kept a secret, but where would you, in an ideal world let\u2019s say two years from now, what are you doing in audio or not", "what does the podcast look like", "well, i imagine i\u2019ll do another season", "and i played with the idea of inviting someone to join the revisionist history rubric and have someone else do a couple of episodes and try something similar", "there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be a kind of \u2013 if i\u2019m doing a collective project, let\u2019s really make it collective not just me dreaming up the \u2013 so i thought about that if i could find someone who took it seriously and sort of shared my \u2013 but i don\u2019t know", "and then, can i make a living doing it?\u00a0that\u2019s another question", "so we can certainly talk more about the last piece offline, but i would say the answer should be yes", "there\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t be", "and on the second to last piece, i would absolutely encourage you to experiment with the format because it\u2019s such a lightweight, relatively speaking, medium and format for doing that", "i mean, i\u2019ve tried four or five different formats", "some were complete strikeouts", "and some, in terms of the cost of creation, in terms of energy, time, money, etc., to the output and impact on listeners was so disproportionately favorable, it was like wow, i\u2019m really glad i tried those five because these didn\u2019t work", "but these solo q&a\u2019s that i do sometimes as round 2\u2019s with guests started off because, if you want to talk about kind of, i was sick at the time i did the peter teal interview", "and so it ended up being this solo read of sorts, which was profound and hilarious and great in a bunch of different ways", "and i realized, wait a second, i don\u2019t actually have to be there for this to be useful to listeners", "and so i hope you experiment with that", "last real question, and then, we\u2019ll wrap up here", "if you had a billboard and could put anything on it, what would you put on that billboard", "probably a picture of one of my favorite runners", "on my phone, i\u2019ll show you what\u2019s on my phone", "oh, yeah", "he\u2019s obscured by all of the \u2013 all of the icons, but who is that", "asbel kiprop, the world\u2019s greatest miler", "from kenya", "he\u2019s my screen saver, my picture on my phone", "i don\u2019t know", "i\u2019m obsessed with the idea that track and field ought to be one of our most popular sports and, in fact, is our least popular sport", "so i would love to \u2013 i want a day when the american record holder in the 5k can walk down the street, and everyone will come up to her and say wow, can i have your autograph?\u00a0and she\u2019ll be mobbed", "and that\u2019s what i want to happen one day", "this could seem like a silly question", "but do you have any quotes that you live your life by or mantras, in a non woo-woo kind of sense that are meaningful to you", "they might just be [inaudible] rules of thumb, anything like that", "not really", "kind of in a playful way, i keep finding myself coming back to the legal adage difficult cases make bad law, which i think is an incredibly insightful comment because we\u2019re drawn to the difficult case", "we shouldn\u2019t generalize from it", "and that\u2019s this problem we run into in the political realm over and over again", "not just the political realm, many realms", "can you give an example of that", "i\u2019m not sure i\u2019m clear", "yeah", "so 9/11, it\u2019s a difficult case, right", "incredibly rare, catastrophic event, catches us by surprise", "should you try to generate policy exclusively from the 9/11 experience", "that\u2019s what we did", "and what did we do", "i think we made a bunch of really terrible mistakes", "we spent $2 trillion on a war that went nowhere and made the world worse off", "we subverted our own civil liberties", "we created these monolithic government agencies that god knows what they\u2019re doing", "are we actually safer than we were", "i\u2019m not sure", "that\u2019s a case where, if we had exercised some restraint and say, you know what, you can\u2019t use a single incident, which was this bizarre outlier, and base the whole national security policy of your country on it", "you have to look at the long view, take the long view", "obama is a very natural \u2013 that kind of thinking is very natural to him", "he\u2019s difficult cases of bad law kind of guy", "he\u2019s like let\u2019s not overreact", "let\u2019s wait and see, that kind of thing, which people find very frustrating with him", "but i like that notion", "similarly, it\u2019s about not overreacting to black swans, to outlying events, and also, choosing your case studies wisely", "that\u2019s what i think it\u2019s really about", "and i suppose you could also generalize it to your personal life in many ways, too", "just because you\u2019re mugged once doesn\u2019t mean you should have a fundamental distrust of every human being as you go throughout life", "yes, exactly right", "and i think we can go further that just because you have been traumatized in some way doesn\u2019t mean you are permanently scarred", "human beings are resilient", "they recover", "and that\u2019s something that sebastian also brought up, and not everyone shares this opinion", "but given his extensive experience with vets and soldiers, he felt like they should not be treated like victims when they come back if they suffer from ptsd for a whole host of reasons that i won\u2019t get into", "but this has been so much fun", "i really think we could continue talking for hours", "but i want to be respectful of your time", "malcolm, where can people find the podcast, where can they find you on social media or elsewhere", "where would you like them to check things out", "the podcast is revisionisthistory.com", "but anywhere there are podcasts, you can find revisionist history", "and my twitter handle is just @gladwell", "i\u2019m the only gladwell out there", "but i\u2019m an indifferent tweeter, but i get into little moments when i go off", "especially if someone brings up the myths and policies of current higher education in the united states", "oh, that gets me going", "i remember po bronson told me once, i asked at a q&a, and this is before i had written any books, and i asked him what he does when he has writer block", "and he said, \u201ci write about what makes me angry.\u201d and, occasionally, i use that", "it seems to work pretty well, at least to get me started", "malcolm, thank you so much for the time", "i really appreciate it", "thank you, tim", "that was really fun", "and i can\u2019t wait to jump into the episodes you mentioned of the podcast", "and i\u2019ll probably just go from start to finish", "i can be pretty linear that way", "and to everybody listening, you can find links to revisionist history, to everything we discussed, the books mentioned, etc., in the show notes at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast", "and until next time, and as always, thank you for listening"]}
