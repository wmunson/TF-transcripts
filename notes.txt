STATUS: links3.csv has best lisat of urls (filtered to on shows.)
	in main.py now need to sort url by pdf vs html response (use ending of url), then send to approproate parser.
	-html parser seems good for basic metris. pdf parser needs more work to refine/match html parser (need json files to have exact same feilds regardless of pdf vs html)
